Abstract = {{The fabrication and magnetic characterization of 15-lm-thick
   electroplated L1(0) CoPt hard magnets with good magnetic properties is
   reported in this paper. Experimental study of the dependence of the
   magnets' properties on annealing temperature reveals that an intrinsic
   coercivity H-ci = similar to 800 kA/m (10 kOe), squareness >0.8, and
   energy product of >150 kJ/m(3) are obtained for photolithographically
   patterned structures (250 mu m x 2 mm stripes; 15 mu m thickness)
   electroplated on silicon substrates and annealed in hydrogen forming gas
   at 700 degrees C. Scanning electron microscopy is used to inspect the
   morphology of both the as-deposited and annealed magnetic layers, and
   X-ray Diffractometer analysis on the magnets annealed at 700 degrees C
   confirm a phase transformation to an ordered L1(0) CoPt structure, with
   a minor phase of hcp Co. These thick films are intended for

Abstract = {{This paper presents a batch-fabrication approach to imprint complex

   magnetic films using fine-scale, laser-machined iron foil ``masks.{''}
   In this approach, pulsed magnetic fields varying between 0.1 and 1.0 T
   are used in conjunction with the field-concentrating effect of the iron
   foil masks to selectively reverse the magnetization of selected regions
   of 10-mu m-thick Co80Pt20 films (Br 1 T, Hci 340 kA/m). Simple stripe
   array patterns are systematically studied both experimentally and via
   simulation, achieving patterned feature sizes (poles) down to 30 mu m.
   Double exposures are also explored to create checkerboard patterns from
   simple stripe-like masks. Finally, masks with more complex patterns are
   used to demonstrate the viability of the approach to imprint arbitrary

   fitting the experimental data for which gap resistance is much larger in
   conductive water than in dielectric water. Accordingly, the resistance
   equation is modified by considering the influence of both plasma and its
   surrounding liquid. Thermal radiation effect of the bubble is also
   studied by comparing two different radiation models. Numerical results
   predict a larger bubble pressure for saline water but a reduced size and
   a smaller bubble cycle at a greater water depth. Such study may be

Title = {{On the Validity of the Poisson Assumption in Sampling Nanometer-Sized
   Aerosols}},
Journal = {{AEROSOL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{For a constant aerosol concentration, it is traditionally assumed that a
   Poisson process describes the behavior of particle detections during
   sampling and consequently fluctuations in the measured concentration.
   Recent studies, however, have shown that sampling of micrometer-sized
   aerosols has non-Poissonian behavior with positive correlations. The
   validity of the Poisson assumption for nanometer-sized aerosols has not
   been established and thus was tested in this study. Its validity was
   tested for four particle sizes-10nm, 25nm, 50nm, and 100nm-by sampling
   from indoor air with a differential mobility analyzer-condensation
   particle counter (DMA-CPC) setup to obtain a time series of particle
   counts. Five metrics were calculated from the data: pair-correlation
   function (PCF), scaled clustering index (SCI), coefficient of variation,
   probability of measuring a concentration at least 25\% greater than
   average, and posterior distributions from Bayesian inference. To
   identify departures from Poissonian behavior, these metrics were also
   calculated for 1000 computer-generated Poisson time series with the same
   mean as the experimental data. For most comparisons, the experimental
   data fell within the range of 80\% of the Poisson-simulation values.
   Essentially, the metrics for the experimental data were mostly
   indistinguishable from a simulated Poisson process. The greater
   influence of Brownian motion for nanometer-sized aerosols may explain
   the Poissonian behavior observed for smaller aerosols. Although the
   Poisson assumption was found to be reasonable in this study it must be
   carefully applied, as the results here do not definitively prove
   applicability in all sampling situations.

Abstract = {{When extracellular action potentials (spikes) from cultured neurons are
   recorded using microelectrode arrays in open wells, their amplitudes are
   usually quite small (often below the noise level) despite the
   extracellular currents originating from the relatively large surface
   area of neural cell somata. In this paper rat cortical neurons were
   seeded into one well of a two well system separated by 3 x 10 mu m
   microtunnels and then seven days later into the second well forming a
   feed-forward network between two small neuronal assemblies. In contrast
   to measurements in the open well spikes recorded from axons within the
   restricted volumes imposed by the microtunnels are often several orders
   of magnitude larger than in the open well, with high signal to noise
   ratio, despite the currents originating in the much smaller surface area
   of the axon. Average signal amplitudes exceeding 250 mu V are typical,
   with some signals as large as 4.5 mV (signal-to-noise ratio up to 450),
   20 times greater than the maximum recorded from electrodes in adjacent
   but open wells. We confirm the dependence of signal amplitude on the
   impedance of the microtunnel and discuss possible reasons for the

Abstract = {{Triticale is being evaluated as a substitute for corn in animal feed and
   as a forage crop for Florida. Storage of triticale seed is difficult in
   Florida's hot and humid climate, and more information about the
   relationships between equilibrium moisture content (EMC) and equilibrium
   relative humidity (ERH) at constant temperature (sorption isotherms) of
   triticale is needed to develop improved storage methods. Therefore, the
   primary research objective was to measure the EMC for triticale seed at
   different ERH values at three different constant temperatures (5 degrees
   C, 23 degrees C, and 35 degrees C) using six desiccation jars containing
   different saturated salt concentrations. The secondary objective was to
   determine the best fit equation describing these relationships. The six
   saturated salt solutions provided relative humidity (RH) values of 11\%,
   23\%, 33\%, 58\%; 75\%, and 84\% at 25 degrees C. An average of ten
   weeks was required to reach equilibrium when the initial moisture
   content (MC) of the seed was 13.35\% (wet basis). The results of this
   experiment were used to develop three prediction equations, (modified
   Henderson, modified Chung-Pfost, and modified Oswin equations)
   representing the relationship between ERH and EMC. The results show that
   the modified Chung-Pfost equation represented this relationship most
   accurately, with a standard error of 2.4\% and a coefficient of
   determination obtained from the scatter plot for the predicted vs.
   measured RH (R-2) equal to 0.99. Overall, this result will aid the
   development and improvement of drying and storage methods for triticale
   seed}},

Abstract = {{Aim: In this work, the potential of nanomagnetic transfection of primary
   human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and the effects of a novel nonviral
   oscillating magnet array system in enhancing transfection efficiency
   were investigated. Materials \& methods: Green fluorescent protein
   plasmids coupled to magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) were introduced onto
   hMSCs in culture. Magnetic fields generated by arrays of neodymium iron
   boron magnets positioned below the culture plates direct the MNP/DNA
   complexes into contact with the cells. The magnet arrays were
   oscillated, promoting more efficient endocytosis via mechanical
   stimulation. Green fluorescent protein expression, cell viability and
   stem cell surface markers were assayed. Results: MNP/DNA complexes were
   delivered into hMSCs, and the oscillating magnet array system appears to
   improve transfection efficiency as well as cell viability. The
   expression of hMSC-specific cell surface markers was unaffected.
   Conclusion: Nonviral transfection using MNPs and oscillating magnet
   arrays offers a more efficient and `cell-friendly' method of
   transfecting hMSCs than other nonviral techniques, while preserving
   their stem cell characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Wing design involves many compromises, but none more important than the
   one between aerodynamics, represented by lift-to-drag ratio, and
   structural weight. Multidisciplinary design optimization is used to
   compare the effect of configuration changes on wing weight and lift/drag
   ratio for 1) cantilever, 2) strut-braced, and 3) truss-braced wing
   aircraft for a medium-range, transonic, 162 passenger mission.
   Pseudo-Pareto fronts are generated to illustrate maximum lift/drag ratio
   compared to minimum wing weight. Lower lift/drag ratio aircraft have a
   shorter, more highly swept wing, with a change in taper at 75\%
   semispan. Higher lft/drag ratio aircraft have much greater span and
   maximum chord at 33\% semispan. To increase lift/drag ratio, both
   wing-weight and takeoff gross weight penalties must be paid. However,
   there are high lift/drag ratio designs with low wing-weight penalty that
   are clearly displayed by the pseudo-Pareto front. Fuel weight minima
   were found in the high lift/drag ratio and low wing-weight region of the
   pseudo-Pareto front for the truss-braced wing with both fuselage-mounted
   and wing-mounted engine configurations and for the cantilever
   configuration. An interesting pseudo-Pareto front was observed for the
   wing-mounted engine truss-braced wing configuration, where the
   pseudo-Pareto front almost became an asymptote to a lift/drag ratio of
   similar to 45. Also, one can look across all the configurations and
   compare attractive designs from each to search for an overall best
   aircraft design.}},

   techniques provide a new framework for selecting profitable diversified
   portfolios, which is verified by computational experiments on historical
   data over the past decade. In addition, the proposed approach can be
   used as a complementary tool for narrowing down a set of ``candidate{''}
   stocks for a diversified portfolio, which can potentially be analyzed
   using other known portfolio selection techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Uncertainty is a concept associated with data acquisition and analysis,
   usually appearing in the form of noise or measure error, often due to
   some technological constraint. In supervised learning, uncertainty
   affects classification accuracy and yields low quality solutions. For
   this reason, it is essential to develop machine learning algorithms able
   to handle efficiently data with imprecision. In this paper we study this
   problem from a robust optimization perspective. We consider a supervised
   learning algorithm based on generalized eigenvalues and we provide a
   robust counterpart formulation and solution in case of ellipsoidal
   uncertainty sets. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed robust
   scheme on artificial and benchmark datasets from University of
   California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository and we compare
   results against a robust implementation of Support Vector Machines.}},

Abstract = {{Biofilm detachment often has detrimental effects such as pipe
   obstruction and infection, yet the detachment mechanisms underlying
   dispersal remain largely unknown. In this study, a stress response
   mechanism known as glutathione-gated potassium efflux (GGKE) was
   evaluated as an active detachment mechanism in the dispersal of
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) was used to
   activate potassium efflux proteins (Kef) associated with the GGKE
   pathway. This stress response mechanism was hypothesized to lead to
   altered cation concentration, which can potentially affect polymer
   bridging in biofilms, and ultimately cause biofilm detachment. Results
   showed the activation of GGKE by NEM exposure caused biofilm detachment
   without inducing a measurable change in viability, and detached biomass
   concentration and composition were dependent on NEM concentration. More
   detached biomass was observed with higher concentrations of NEM, with a
   trend of increasing polymer detachment. The detachment was likely
   resulting from a weakened biofilm structural integrity induced by bridge
   denaturing from GGKE activation. This study is important in
   understanding biofilm detachment from engineered systems such as
   membrane aerated bioreactors.}},

Abstract = {{Ferroelectric HfO2 is an attractive candidate for future ferroelectric
   random access memory devices due to its compatibility with the
   complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor process, conformal deposition,
   and scaling ability. Crystallization of HfO2 with different dopants and
   annealing conditions can produce the stabilization of the monoclinic,
   tetragonal, cubic, or orthorhombic crystal phases. In this work, the
   authors observe ferroelectric behavior in Si-doped hafnium oxide with
   TiN and Ir electrodes. Atomic layer deposited 10 nm HfO2 capacitors
   doped with varying concentrations of SiO2 have been fabricated in the
   metal-ferroelectric-insulator-semiconductor (MFIS) structure. The
   ferroelectric characteristics of thin film HfO2 are compared in the MFIS
   and metal-ferroelectric-metal configurations. Post-metallization anneals
   were applied to all thin film ferroelectric HfO2 capacitors, resulting
   in a remanent polarization of up to 22 mu C/cm(2) and a range of
   observed coercive voltages, emphasizing the importance of the annealing
   conditions, electrode materials, and device structure on the
   ferroelectric properties of thin film HfO2. (C) 2014 American Vacuum

Title = {{Formation of Alcohols and Carbonyl Compounds from Hexane and Cyclohexane

Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{5, 1}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, vaporized n-hexane in a flowing argon carrier gas was
   mixed with deionized liquid water and injected into a tubular plasma
   reactor. A liquid water film forms on the wall of the tubular reactor
   and plasma channels propagate along the gas-liquid interface.
   Gas-chromatography mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance
   spectroscopic analysis of the major products and their relative ratios
   collected in the effluent of the reactor confirm the formation of
   3-hexanol (26\%), 2-hexanol (21\%), 3-hexanone (17\%), 2-hexanone
   (17\%), 1-hexanol (11\%), and hexanal (8\%). The functionalization is
   likely due to oxidation of the organic stating material by OH radicals
   formed from the dissociation of water by the plasma. The
   functionalization of cyclohexane was achieved in the same manner where
   analysis showed the formation of cyclohexanone (47\%), cyclohexene
   (20\%), cyclohexanol (19\%), hexanal (11\%), and 2-cyclohexenone (2\%).
   Hydrogen peroxide was also produced in the presence of either organic
   compound and the amount formed decreased as the amount of organic
   flowing into the reactor was increased. It is likely that the hydrogen
   peroxide is formed in the gas phase close to the gas-liquid interface by
   OH radical recombination. This paper demonstrates the activation of the
   C-H bond using low temperature plasma by combining two common chemical
   feedstocks (hydrocarbon and water) and transforming them into the higher
   value functionalized organic products via a sequence of reactions where
   all necessary intermediate reactants are formed in situ by the electric
   discharge.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of unified tracking and regulation visual servo control is
   addressed in this paper, for a wheeled mobile robot (WMR) equipped with
   a single monocular camera system. The desired trajectory or desired
   fixed position and orientation are defined using a prerecorded image
   sequence (i.e., a video) or a single image (i.e., a snapshot) of four
   feature points. Euclidean homographies are developed by exploiting the
   projective geometric relationships that exist between the feature points
   in the live image and the prerecorded sequence of images and the
   corresponding feature points in a fixed reference image. The information
   obtained from the Euclidean homographies is then utilized to recast the
   WMR kinematics in a standard WMR form. A rigorous Lyapunov-based
   analysis is provided to show that the proposed visual servo control
   approach achieves simultaneous tracking and regulation control for the
   on-board camera-in-hand problem.}},

Title = {{In Situ Nail Withdrawal Strengths in Wood Roof Structures}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Premature failure of wood roof sheathing under wind loading has
   primarily been blamed on poor nail installation resulting in reduced
   nail withdrawal strengths. However, this increased vulnerability could
   also result from environmental effects and aging of the materials, but
   little information exists on the in situ withdrawal strengths of nails
   in actual wood buildings. To address this knowledge gap, the authors
   evaluated the withdrawal strengths of nails from 17 existing Florida
   homes, and they observed relatively low in situ nail withdrawal
   capacities in the tests. Further, laboratory tests compared the
   withdrawal strengths of nails determined using an industry-standard test
   protocol against an in situ nail test procedure. The study documented
   the effects of (1) through-sheathing nail installation, (2) nail
   withdrawal rate, and (3) sheathing removal methods on nail withdrawal
   capacity. The in situ nail test procedure consistently produced lower
   nail withdrawal capacities than did the industry-standard test protocol.
   Nail withdrawal capacity is reduced by combination of local sheathing
   removal methods to access the nail head, and by driving nails through
   sheathing. The results suggest empirically determined nail withdrawal
   capacity for nails provide nonconservative results. (C) 2014 American

Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{541-549}},

Abstract = {{The performance of a photovoltaic module under operating conditions
   mainly depends on two factors: solar irradiation and cell temperature.
   These two factors are strongly influenced by mounting geometrical
   parameters. This paper studies the effects of mounting parameters on
   photovoltaic (PV) module performance by using CFD and single diode
   model. The results show that maximum power output happens at the tilt
   angle where the incoming solar irradiation reaches the peak value. The
   relationship between efficiency and tilt angle acts differently based on
   wind velocity inside the gap. The air gap height, the distance between
   the module and roof, determines the heat transfer mechanism inside the
   air gap and then greatly affects the module performance. When the flow
   inside the air gap becomes fully developed, both the module power output
   and efficiency reach the greatest value. The result of this study
   provides theoretical basis to design mounting parameter for PV module
   installation and helps maximize energy efficiency in practical operating
   condition. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   the development of a comprehensive framework for modeling drivers'
   lane-changing maneuver on arterials by using driver behavior-related
   data. Focus group studies and ``in-vehicle{''} driving tests were
   performed to investigate the effects of driver type under various lane
   changes on urban arterials and to collect microscopic vehicular data.
   With these field collected values, a model was developed to estimate the
   probability of changing lanes under various lane-changing scenarios and
   to estimate the corresponding gap acceptance characteristics. The
   lane-changing probability for each scenario was modeled as a function of
   the factors identified from the focus group discussions, as well as the
   driver types. In the gap acceptance modeling, a sequence of
   ``hand-shaking negotiations{''} was introduced to describe vehicle
   interactions that may occur during lane-changing maneuvers. The proposed
   lane-changing model was implemented in the CORSIM (CORrider SIMulation)
   micro-simulator. The simulation capabilities of the newly developed
   model were compared to the original lane-changing algorithm in CORSIM
   and to the field observations. The validation results indicated that the
   new model better replicates the observed traffic under various levels of
   flow.}},

Abstract = {{Microscale patterned surfaces have been shown to control the arrangement
   of bacteria attached to surfaces. This study was conducted to examine
   the effect of patterned topographies on bacterial fouling using
   Enterobacter cloacae as the test model. E. cloacae is an opportunistic
   pathogen involved frequently in nosocomial infections. It is an
   important model organism to be studied in the context of healthcare
   associated infections (HAI) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) based
   urinary catheter fouling. Patterned surfaces, such as SharkletTM, have
   shown the promise of being a benign surface treatment for prevention of
   catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI). To the best of our
   knowledge, inhibition of fouling by E. cloacae has not been demonstrated
   on microscale patterned PDMS surfaces. In this study, the SharkletTM and
   smooth PDMS surfaces were used as controls. All pattern surfaces had
   statistically significantly lower percentage area coverage compared to
   the smooth PDMS control. A cross type feature (C-1-PDMS), demonstrated
   the most significant reduction in percent area coverage, 89\% (p < 0.01,
   alpha= 0.05), compared to the smooth PDMS control and all other
   patterned test surfaces. Additionally, theoretical calculations show
   that C-1-PDMS is the only surface predicted to hold the
   thermodynamically stable Cassie state, which occurs due to trapping air
   pockets at the liquid solid interface. Combined the results provide new
   insights for designing environmentally benign, novel, microscale
   patterned surfaces for restricting bacterial fouling. (C) 2014 Elsevier

   diameter 1.8 nm are analyzed. We find that the GB tends to move towards
   the void when they are within a few nm of each other. With increasing
   temperature, GB migration from greater distances toward to the void is
   predicted to take place. Both GB pinning to the void and void
   dissolution at the GB take place. The atomic-level mechanisms and the

Abstract = {{Magnetic polymer colloids (MPCs) consisting of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles
   (NPs) embedded in a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix were
   synthesized by magnetic miniemulsion polymerization. CoFe2O4 NPs were
   modified with 3-trimethoxysilylpropylmethacrylate and directly
   emulsified with different concentrations of sodium dodecyl sulfate under
   ultrasonication for subsequent miniemulsion polymerization. The average
   diameter of the CoFe2O4/PMMA spheres (about 200 nm) was controlled by
   varying the amount of surfactant. Thermogravimetric analysis indicated
   that the magnetic content was in the range of 44 to 73 \%. Magnetic
   properties of the dispersions were investigated by measuring equilibrium
   magnetization curves and the dynamic magnetic susceptibility as a
   function of frequency. The MPCs were found to follow the Debye model for
   the dynamic magnetic susceptibility, with a characteristic time given by
   the rotational hydrodynamic resistance and thermal energy through the
   Stokes-Einstein relation. This demonstrates that the MPCs respond to
   applied magnetic fields by rotating. Due to their uniform size and high
   magnetic loading, these colloids may be suitable in a variety of
   applications, including nanoscale mechanical probes and actuators in
   complex fluids and biological systems.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate an improvement in energy efficiency and network lifetime
   for the cluster-based multi channel cognitive radio sensor network
   (CRSN). The improvement roots from two techniques proposed in dynamic
   spectrum access. The first technique exploits packet size adaptation:
   varying the packet size to adapt the transmission over the state-varying
   channel. This is to efficiently utilize the battery of sensors by having
   the most appropriately sized packets successfully transmitted, in
   accordance with the instantaneous channel conditions. The second
   technique focuses on channel assignment with awareness of the residual
   energy of sensors, such that sensors can spend their energy in a
   balanced way. This helps to prolong the network lifetime, compared to
   the random channel pairing approach. As all those techniques rely on the
   estimates of channel states and their performance is tied with the
   estimation accuracy, we theoretically derive a polynomial-time
   resolvable expression for the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator PMF
   function. In light of this expression, the impact of channel estimation
   accuracy on network performance is thereby illustrated. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Network coding is a paradigm in data transport that allows a network
   node to code information flows before forwarding them. While it has been
   theoretically proven that network coding saves bandwidth and increases
   throughput of multicast communication, it does not directly consider the
   quality of service (QoS) requirements of multicast routing. In this
   paper, we study the problem of establishing minimumcost, multiple
   multicast sessions over coded packet networks to meet the statistical
   QoS target considering bounded end-to-end statistical delay and jitter
   from source to each destination. For this purpose, we first propose a
   path-based formulation for the problem and prove that this problem is
   NP-hard. Then, in order to obtain an exact solution, we present an
   effective and efficient decomposition approach in which the problem is
   decomposed into master problem and subproblems, and the solution is
   built up successively by feasible path generation. Computational results
   on random networks show that the proposed method provides an efficient
   way for solving the problem, even for relatively large networks. (C)

   is here utilized to identify the active conduction mechanisms in the

   reveals that the bulk conduction in fast-fired barium titanate is the
   result of variable-range hopping with relatively short hopping distance
   (similar to 0.5 nm) compared to other colossal permittivity materials. A
   common equivalent circuit that can model the contributions of the

   of measuring the rotational diffusivity of thermally blocked magnetic
   nanoparticles (MNPs) in protein solutions. To illustrate the technique,
   the effect of nanoparticle zeta potential in
   carboxymethyl-dextran-coated MNPs and their interaction with model
   anionic and cationic proteins, such as bovine serum albumin (BSA),
   immunoglobulin G (IgG), fibrinogen (FIBR), apo-transferrin (TRANS),
   lysozyme (LYZ), and histone (HIS), in a range of protein concentrations
   is studied. Experiments indicate that interactions between the
   negatively charged particles and the negatively charged proteins BSA,
   IgG, FIBR, and TRANS are negligible. However, positively charged
   proteins LYZ and HIS readily absorb onto the nanoparticles, as evidenced
   by an increase in size and eventual aggregation of the particles. Onset
   of this effect seems to happen at a lower concentration of HIS compared
   with LYZ. The technique could be applied to other particle surface
   coatings and to particles in complex protein mixtures, such as whole
   blood and serum, allowing systematic in situ studies of
   nanoparticle-protein interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Integrated agricultural systems modeling represents an effective
   research tool to meet the evolving challenges facing agricultural
   production and environmental quality. An integrated, process-based model
   was developed to simulate the impacts of the changing environment and
   different water and farming management practices on the hydrology, water
   quality, and crop growth and yield for artificially drained cropping
   systems. The new model; named DRAINMOD-DSSAT, was developed by
   integrating three different process based models: the hydrological
   model, DRAINMOD; the soil carbon and nitrogen (N) dynamics model;
   DRAINMOD-NII, and selected crop modules of the DSSAT-CSM model; CROPGRO
   and CERES-Maize. The integration of the three component models is
   implemented at the source code level and allows for daily interactions
   and feedback among simulated climatic conditions, soil water and
   nitrogen, and crop growth. DRAINMOD-DSSAT performance was evaluated
   using a 10-yr dataset collected from a corn-soybean production system on
   a subsurface drained field in Iowa, with corn receiving low, medium, and
   high N fertilization rates. The model was calibrated using the data
   collected from the high-N treatment, and validated for the other two
   treatments. Annual and monthly subsurface drainage outflows were
   predicted with modeling efficiencies (NSE) of 0.95 and 0.83,
   respectively. The NSE's for annual and monthly NO3-N mass losses were
   0.87 and 0.70 for the high N-treatment, 0.93 and 0.86 for the medium
   N-treatment, 0.94 and 0.67 for the low N-treatment, respectively.
   Predicted and measured crop yields were accurately predicted with an
   absolute percent error less than 8\% in 27 of the 30 simulated
   plot-years (3 plots x 10 yrs). Nitrogen removal in crop grain was
   reasonably predicted. This first model application suggested the
   potential capability of DRAINMOD-DSSAT of simulating the hydrology,
   water quality, and crop growth and yield for corn and soybean production
   on artificially drained fields in response to varying climatic
   conditions and nutrient management practices. Further research, using
   more intense field measurements, is needed to validate the model for its
   intended use. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the upper troposphere, gas phase species can partition to cloud ice,
   undergo chemical reaction and contribute to particle mass aloft,
   affecting chemical cycling in the atmosphere. This manuscript describes
   the first implementation of gas-to-cloud ice partitioning of three
   inorganic gases, HNO3, SO2 and H2O2, along with subsequent SO2 oxidation
   in the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) chemical transport model.
   Four simulations are performed with CMAQv4.7.1 that include lightning
   production of NO for August 12th-25th of 2005 to investigate the impacts
   of ice chemistry on CMAQ-predicted gas phase mixing ratios and particle
   mass concentrations of associated species. Considerable episodic
   decreases, greater than 25\%, in gas phase HNO3 are noted at pressures
   of 200-600 mb, with the largest changes at 300-400 mb. Effects are also
   induced on other gases in the nitrogen budget. NOx and HONO mixing
   ratios decrease up to 20\%, but changes are generally less than 10\%.
   Nitrate aerosol mass concentrations increase up to 0.15 mu g m(-3) for
   the highest model layers (100 mb). We find that phase changes in
   nitrogen species induced by ice partitioning are sensitive to CMAQ
   predictions of the aerosol phase accumulation mode ammonium to sulfate
   ratios {[}NH4+] : {[}SO42-]. Predicted O-3 concentrations do not change
   (< 1\%). No changes in H2O2, SO2, or sulfate aerosol concentrations are
   observed. 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The impact of patients' gender, race, and age on health care
   professionals' pain management decisions: An online survey using virtual

Volume = {{51}},

Abstract = {{Background: Previous literature indicates that biases exist in pain
   ratings. Healthcare professionals have been found to use patient
   demographic cues such as sex, race, and age when making decisions about
   pain treatment. However, there has been little research comparing
   healthcare professionals' (i.e., physicians and nurses) pain decision
   policies based on patient demographic cues.
   Methods: The current study used virtual human technology to examine the
   impact of patients' sex, race, and age on healthcare professionals' pain
   ratings. One hundred and ninety-three healthcare professionals (nurses
   and physicians) participated in this online study.
   Results: Healthcare professionals assessed virtual human patients who
   were male and African American to be experiencing greater pain intensity
   and were more willing to administer opioid analgesics to them than to
   their demographic counterparts. Similarly, nurses were more willing to
   administer opioids make treatment decisions than physicians. There was
   also a significant virtual human-sex by healthcare professional
   interaction for pain assessment and treatment decisions. The sex
   difference (male > female) was greater for nurses than physicians.
   Conclusions: Results replicated findings of previous studies using
   virtual human patients to assess the effect of sex, race, and age in
   pain decision-making. In addition, healthcare professionals' pain
   ratings differed depending on healthcare profession. Nurses were more
   likely to rate pain higher and be more willing to administer opioid
   analgesics than were physicians. Healthcare professionals rated male and
   African American virtual human patients as having higher pain in most
   pain assessment and treatment domains compared to their demographic
   counterparts. Similarly the virtual human-sex difference ratings were
   more pronounced for nurses than physicians. Given the large number of
   patients seen throughout the healthcare professionals' careers, these
   pain practice biases have important public health implications. This
   study suggests attention to the influence of patient demographic cues in
   pain management education is needed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{alpha B-crystallin (CRYAB) is present at a high frequency in poor
   prognosis basal-like breast tumours, which are largely absent of
   oestrogen, progesterone receptors and HER2 known as triple-negative
   breast cancer (TNBC). CRYAB functions as a molecular chaperone to bind
   to and correct intracellular misfolded/unfolded proteins such as
   vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), preventing non-specific
   protein aggregations under the influence of the tumour microenvironment
   stress and/or anti-cancer treatments including bevacizumab therapy.
   Directly targeting CRYAB can sensitize tumour cells to chemotherapeutic
   agents and decrease tumour aggressiveness. However, growing evidence
   shows that CRYAB is a critical adaptive response element after ischemic
   heart disease and stroke, implying that directly targeting CRYAB might
   cause serious unwanted side effects. Here, we used structure-based
   molecular docking of CRYAB and identified a potent small molecular
   inhibitor, NCI-41356, which can strongly block the interaction between
   CRYAB and VEGF(165) without affecting CRYAB levels. The disruption of
   the interaction between CRYAB and VEGF(165) elicits in vitro anti-tumour
   cell proliferation and invasive effects through the down-regulation of
   VEGF signalling in the breast cancer cells. The observed in vitro
   anti-tumour angiogenesis of endothelial cells might be attributed to the
   down-regulation of paracrine VEGF signalling in the breast cancer cells
   after treatment with NCI-41356. Intraperitoneal injection of NCI-41356
   greatly inhibits the tumour growth and vasculature development in in
   vivo human breast cancer xenograft models. Our findings provide
   `proof-of-concept' for the development of highly specific
   structure-based alternative targeted therapy for the prevention and/or
   treatment of TNBC.}},

Abstract = {{This study theoretically investigated detachment of homoaggregates and
   heteroaggregates attached on the planar surfaces at primary minima
   during transients in solution chemistry. The homoaggregates were
   represented as small colloidal clusters with well-defined structures or
   as clusters generated by randomly packing spheres using Monte Carlo
   method. The heteroaggregates were modeled as microparticles coated with
   nanoparticles. Surface element integration technique was adopted to
   calculate Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) interaction energies
   for the homoaggregates and heteroaggregates at different ionic
   strengths. Results show that attached homoaggregates on the planar
   surface at primary minima are irreversible to reduction in solution
   ionic strength whether the primary spheres of the homoaggregates are
   nano- or micro-sized. Heteroaggregation of nanoparticles with a
   microparticle can cause DLVO interaction energy to decrease
   monotonically with separation distance at low ionic strengths (e.g., <=
   0.01 M), indicating that the heteroaggregates experience repulsive
   forces at all separation distances. Therefore, attachment of the
   heteroaggregates at primary minima can be detached upon reduction in
   ionic strength. Additionally, we showed that the adhesive forces and
   torques that the aforementioned heteroaggregates experience can be
   significantly smaller than those experienced by the microspheres without
   attaching nanoparticles, thus, the heteroaggregates are readily detached
   via hydrodynamic drag. Results of study provide plausible explanation
   for the observations in the literature that attached/aggregated
   particles can be detached/redispersed from primary minima upon reduction
   in ionic strength, which challenges the common belief that
   attachment/aggregation of particles in primary minima is chemically
   irreversible. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A complete surgical excision with negative tumor margins is the single
   most important factor in the prediction of long-term survival for most
   cancer patients with solid tumors. We hypothesized that image-guided
   surgery using nanoparticle-enhanced photoacoustic and fluorescence
   imaging could significantly reduce the rate of local recurrence.
   A murine model of invasive mammary carcinoma was utilized. Three
   experimental groups were included: (1) control; (2) tumor-bearing mice
   injected with non-targeted nanoprobe; and (3) tumor-bearing mice
   injected with targeted nanoprobe. The surgeon removed the primary tumor
   following the guidance of photoacoustic imaging (PAI), then inspected
   the surgical wound and removed the suspicious tissue using
   intraoperative near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging. The mice were
   followed with bioluminescence imaging weekly to quantify local
   recurrence.
   Nanoprobe-enhanced photoacoustic contrast enabled PAI to map the
   volumetric tumor margins up to a depth of 31 mm. The targeted
   nanoparticles provided significantly greater enhancement than
   non-targeted nanoparticles. Seven mice in the group injected with the
   targeted nanoprobes underwent additional resections based upon NIR
   fluorescence imaging. Pathological analysis confirmed residual cancer
   cells in the re-resected specimens in 5/7 mice. Image-guided resection
   resulted in a significant reduction in local recurrence; 8.7 and 33.3 \%
   of the mice in the targeted and control groups suffered recurrence,
   respectively.
   These results suggest that photoacoustic and NIR intraoperative imaging
   can effectively assist a surgeon to locate primary tumors and to
   identify residual disease in real-time. This technology has promise to
   overcome current clinical challenges that result in the need for second
   surgical procedures.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider two decomposition schemes for the graph
   theoretical description of the axial Multidimensional Assignment Problem
   (MAP). The problem is defined as finding n disjoint cliques of size m
   with minimum total cost in K (mxn) , which is an m-partite graph with n
   elements per dimension. Even though the 2-dimensional assignment problem
   is solvable in polynomial time, extending the problem to include na
   parts per thousand yen3 dimensions renders it -hard. We propose two
   novel decomposition schemes for partitioning a MAP into disjoint
   subproblems, that can then be recombined to provide both upper and lower
   bounds to the original problem. For each of the partitioning schemes, we
   investigate and compare the efficiency of distinct exact and heuristic
   methodologies, namely augmentation and partitioning. Computational
   results for the methods, along with a hybrid one that consists of both
   partitioning schemes, are presented to depict the success of our
   approaches on large-scale instances.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the problem of sending a set of multiple
   commodities from their origin to destination nodes via intermediate
   hubs. Each hub node is associated with a reliability function, which
   depends on the total flow that crosses that hub. The probability that
   each commodity is successfully relayed from its origin to its
   destination is given by the product of hub reliabilities on the
   commodity's path. The problem we consider seeks to find minimum-cost
   commodity paths such that each commodity reaches its destination with a
   sufficiently large probability. We first formulate the problem as a
   nonlinear multicommodity network-flow problem and prove that it is
   strongly NP-hard. We then present two linearization techniques for this
   formulation, and propose a pair of lower- and upper-bounding
   formulations, which can then be used within an exact cutting-plane
   algorithm to solve the problem. Finally, we analyze the computational
   effectiveness of our proposed strategies on a set of randomly generated
   instances.}},

Abstract = {{The commercialization of graphene requires a new route for its
   industrial scale production that does not involve high costs, hazardous
   raw materials, and complex production techniques. Here, we report a
   simple and cost effective approach for producing highly conductive
   graphene films by reducing graphene oxide (GO) sheets without
   high-temperature annealing or any toxic solvent. At 90 C, ionic
   solutions, such as MgCl2, NaCl, AgNO3, FeSO4, CuCl2, and AlCl3, not only
   reduce GO but also cross-link adjacent graphene sheets to form reduced
   GO (Re-GO) films on various substrates. All of the GO-based films show
   color change from brown to grey and improved electro-conductivities. The
   as-prepared Re-GO films can directly be prepared onto target substrates
   without any transfer processes, which keeps the integrity of the films.
   Electrodes modified by Re-GO metal nanocomposite films present extremely
   large electro-active surface area and fast amperometric response, which
   is promising for sensor development. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{At approximately 50 mu m thin, the human amniotic membrane (hAM) has
   been shown to be a versatile biomaterial with applications ranging from
   ocular transplants to skin and nerve regeneration. These investigations
   describe laminating layers of the hAM into a multilayered, conformation
   creating a thicker, more robust biomaterial for applications requiring
   more supportive structures. Amniotic membranes were decellularized using
   4 M NaCl and prepared as either flat single-layered sheets or rolled
   into concentric five-layered configurations. Constructs were seeded with
   human vascular smooth muscle cells and cultured over 40 days to quantify
   biological and mechanical changes that occurred during early remodeling
   events. By day 40 single-layered constructs displayed a decreasing trend
   in cellular densities and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) concentration,
   comparative to multilayered constructs with increasing cell densities
   (from 9.1 to 32 x 10(6) cells/g) and GAG concentrations (from 6.07 to
   17.4 mg/g). Oxygen diffusion was calculated and found to be sufficient
   to maintain cell populations through the constructs full thickness.
   Although an overall decrease in the modulus of elasticity was noted, the
   modulus in the failure range of rolled constructs stabilized at values
   25 times higher than single-layered constructs. Rolled constructs
   typically displayed an upregulation of contractile and matrix remodeling
   markers (alpha-actin, SM22 and type 1 collagen, MMP-2 respectively)
   indicating biological adaptation. Considerable design flexibility can be
   achieved by varying the number of scaffold layers, allowing the
   possibility of tuning the constructs physical dimensions, shape and
   tensile properties to suit specific targeted vascular locations. (c)

Title = {{Effect of phase on debond strength in shape memory alloy reinforced
   composites}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{98-102}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Systematic single fiber pullout tests were performed on epoxy composites
   embedded with nickel titanium shape memory alloy (SMA) wires. The SMA
   wires were tested in the austenitic or martensitic states to study and
   decouple the elastic moduli from martensite transformation or
   reorientation stresses in the analysis of debond loads. The results
   reveal that the SMA wires that were in the austenite phase consistently
   produced higher debond loads as compared to that of those wires that
   started in the martensite phase, likely due to differences in the
   Poisson's ratio. Additionally, there appears to be a relationship
   between the elastic modulus and debond load where reinforcements with a
   higher elastic modulus displayed lower debond loads. Lastly, for SMA
   reinforcements that underwent a martensitic phase transformation or
   reorientation, the debond load was equivalent to the martensite
   transformation or reorientation load. The results of this work
   illustrate the sensitivity of SMA reinforced composites on the
   mechanical behavior and phase transformation characteristics of the
   constituent materials. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Pectinase formulations from Aspergillus niger, are commonly used in
   fruit juice clarification. The effect of moderate temperature (42.4-62.4
   degrees C) at pressures that stabilize a pectinase formulation (200 and
   300 MPa) was studied. The rate of viscosity reduction of pectin
   solutions increased with temperature with a maximum of 0.0960 +/- 0.0108
   Pa-1 s(-2) at 62.4 degrees C and 300 MPa which represents a 2.6-fold
   increase in rate of viscosity reduction relative to the recommended
   conditions of 45 degrees C and 0.1 MPa. Negative apparent activation
   volumes of -0.22 +/- 0.18 to -5.21 +/- 0.39 cm(3) mol(-1) indicate that
   pressure favored the increase in the rate of viscosity reduction with
   pressure having the greatest effect at 57.1 degrees C. Apparent
   activation energies of 27.7 +/- 0.7 to 42.4 +/- 11.3 kJ mol(-1) K-1

Abstract = {{For a current deregulated power system, a large amount of operating
   reserve is often required to maintain the reliability of the power
   system using traditional approaches. In this paper, we propose a
   two-stage robust optimization model to address the network constrained
   unit commitment problem under uncertainty. In our approach, uncertain
   problem parameters are assumed to be within a given uncertainty set. We
   study cases with and without transmission capacity and ramp-rate limits
   (The latter case was described in Zhang and Guan (2009), for which the
   analysis part is included in Section 3 in this paper). We also analyze
   solution schemes to solve each problem that include an exact solution
   approach and an efficient heuristic approach that provides tight lower
   and upper bounds for the general network constrained robust unit
   commitment problem. The final computational experiments on an IEEE
   118-bus system verify the effectiveness of our approaches, as compared
   to the nominal model without considering the uncertainty. (C) 2013

   Hydroxyapatite/polysulfone laminated composites were fabricated to
   develop biologically compatible, toughened composites that would match
   the elastic modulus of bone. Multilayered composites were successfully
   designed with improved toughness measured by the work of fracture.
   Toughness measurements were more than an order of magnitude greater than
   monolithic hydroxyapatite. The toughness and modulus values of

Abstract = {{For the first time, we detected optical changes elicited by seizure
   activity in pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-treated rats (n = 6) versus saline
   controls (n = 2) over a 30 min recording session using a novel
   time-series analysis of scattering images obtained non-invasively with a
   real-time multispectral diffuse optical tomography (DOT) system.
   Spatio-temporal images of absorption and scattering coefficients were
   recovered from PTZ- and saline-treated rats' brains using a finite
   element-based DOT image reconstruction algorithm. After pulse artifacts
   were eliminated, an independent component (IC) analysis was conducted
   for blind-source separation of the optical signals. The retrieved ICs
   were compared with concurrently measured EEG signals, and the selected
   components were further refined using K-means clustering and spectrum
   analysis tools. The results revealed that changes in absorption and
   scattering coefficients emerge sooner than changes in the EEG signal and
   a low frequency peak signal of 0.3 Hz in the spectra of light scattering
   images after PTZ injection. This low frequency caused by slow volume
   changes in CNS cells was not detected in control animals. Brain regions
   that we detected early changes in optical signals and activation maps
   were confirmed in an additional 3 PTZ-treated rats using the DOT system
   and concurrent EEG recordings obtained from multiple brain regions. Our
   results show that the analysis of scattered diffuse light is a sensitive
   and reliable modality for detecting changes in neural activity
   associated with generalized seizure and other CNS disorders with the
   additional benefit of providing access to physiological parameters that
   other modalities cannot access. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   Distribution for Convection-Enhanced Delivery in the Rat Brain}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 28}},
Abstract = {{Flow back along a needle track (backflow) can be a problem during direct
   infusion, e.g. convection-enhanced delivery (CED), of drugs into soft
   tissues such as brain. In this study, the effect of needle insertion
   speed on local tissue injury and backflow was evaluated in vivo in the
   rat brain. Needles were introduced at three insertion speeds (0.2, 2,
   and 10 mm/s) followed by CED of Evans blue albumin (EBA) tracer. Holes
   left in tissue slices were used to reconstruct penetration damage. These
   measurements were also input into a hyperelastic model to estimate
   radial stress at the needle-tissue interface (pre-stress) before
   infusion. Fast insertion speeds were found to produce more tissue
   bleeding and disruption; average hole area at 10 mm/s was 1.87-fold the
   area at 0.2 mm/s. Hole measurements also differed at two fixation time
   points after needle retraction, 10 and 25 min, indicating that
   pre-stresses are influenced by time-dependent tissue swelling.
   Calculated pre-stresses were compressive (0 to 485 Pa) and varied along
   the length of the needle with smaller average values within white matter
   (116 Pa) than gray matter (301 Pa) regions. Average pre-stress at 0.2
   mm/s (351.7 Pa) was calculated to be 1.46-fold the value at 10 mm/s. For
   CED backflow experiments (0.5, 1, and 2 mu L/min), measured EBA backflow
   increased as much as 2.46-fold between 10 and 0.2 mm/s insertion speeds.
   Thus, insertion rate-dependent damage and changes in pre-stress were
   found to directly contribute to the extent of backflow, with slower
   insertion resulting in less damage and improved targeting.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of annealing, T4 and T6 heat treatment on microstructure,
   mechanical properties and damping capacities of a
   quasicrystal-reinforced Mg-Zn-Y-Zr alloy (the ZWK3 alloy) were
   investigated in this study. The structural results show that the
   Mg0.97Zn0.03 phase could transform to Mg7Zn3 phase during annealing and
   only primary phase and the I-Mg3YZn6 quasicrystal phase exist in the T4
   treated ZWK3 alloy. Further aging in T6 treatment precipitates a large
   amount of nanoscaled MgZn2 phase. The thermal treatment could improve
   the tensile strength of the ZWK3 alloy greatly, while a large reduction
   in elongation and high strain amplitude damping are obtained compared
   with that of the as-cast alloy. In spite of this, the damping values of
   three heat treated ZWK3 alloys all exceed 0.01, representing our studied
   alloys still belong to high damping magnesium alloys. Decrease of
   mobility of dislocations, resulting from tanglement and pinning, is
   responsible for damping decline. We also find that twins only observed
   in the T6 treated ZWK3 alloy could produce new damping sources besides
   dislocation. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The aspect ratio of barium titanate (BaTiO3) nanowires is demonstrated
   to be successfully controlled by adjusting the temperature of the
   hydrothermal growth from 150 to 240 degrees C, corresponding to aspect
   ratios from 9.3 to 45.8, respectively. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)
   nanocomposites are formed from the various aspect ratio nanowires and
   the relationship between the dielectric constant of the nanocomposite
   and the aspect ratio of the fillers is quantified. It was found that the
   dielectric constant of the nanocomposite increases with the aspect ratio
   of the nanowires. Nanocomposites with 30 vol \% BaTiO3 nanowires and an
   aspect ratio of 45.8 can reach a dielectric constant of 44.3, which is
   30.7\% higher than samples with an aspect ratio of 9.3 and 352\% larger

Title = {{Conjugate heat and mass transfer in the lattice Boltzmann equation
   method}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 22}},
Abstract = {{An interface treatment for conjugate heat and mass transfer in the
   lattice Boltzmann equation method is proposed based on our previously
   proposed second-order accurate Dirichlet and Neumann boundary schemes.
   The continuity of temperature (concentration) and its flux at the
   interface for heat (mass) transfer is intrinsically satisfied without
   iterative computations, and the interfacial temperature (concentration)
   and their fluxes are conveniently obtained from the microscopic
   distribution functions without finite-difference calculations. The
   present treatment takes into account the local geometry of the interface
   so that it can be directly applied to curved interface problems such as
   conjugate heat and mass transfer in porous media. For straight
   interfaces or curved interfaces with no tangential gradient, the
   coupling between the interfacial fluxes along the discrete lattice
   velocity directions is eliminated and thus the proposed interface
   schemes can be greatly simplified. Several numerical tests are conducted
   to verify the applicability and accuracy of the proposed conjugate
   interface treatment, including (i) steady convection-diffusion in a
   channel containing two different fluids, (ii) unsteady
   convection-diffusion in the channel, (iii) steady heat conduction inside
   a circular domain with two different solid materials, and (iv) unsteady
   mass transfer from a spherical droplet in an extensional creeping flow.
   The accuracy and order of convergence of the simulated interior
   temperature (concentration) field, the interfacial temperature
   (concentration), and heat (mass) flux are examined in detail and
   compared with those obtained from the ``half-lattice division{''}
   treatment in the literature. The present analysis and numerical results
   show that the half-lattice division scheme is second-order accurate only
   when the interface is fixed at the center of the lattice links, while
   the present treatment preserves second-order accuracy for arbitrary link
   fractions. For curved interfaces, the present treatment yields
   second-order accurate interior and interfacial temperatures
   (concentrations) and first-order accurate interfacial heat (mass) flux.
   An increase of order of convergence by one degree is obtained for each
   of these three quantities compared with the half-lattice division
   scheme. The surface-averaged Sherwood numbers computed in test (iv)
   agree well with published results.}},

   the Extended Logistic Model}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 22}},
Abstract = {{The Extended Logistic Model (ELM) has been previously shown to
   adequately describe seasonal biomass production and N removal with
   respect to applied N for several types of annuals and perennials. In
   this analysis, data from a corn (Zea mays L.) study with variable
   applied N were analyzed to test hypotheses that certain parameters in
   the ELM are invariant with respect to site specific attributes, like
   environmental conditions and soil type. Invariance to environmental
   conditions suggests such parameters may be functions of the crop
   characteristics and certain other management practices alone (like plant
   population, planting date, harvest date). The first parameter analyzed
   was Delta b, the difference between the N uptake shifting parameter and
   the biomass shifting parameter. The second parameter tested was N-cm,
   the maximum N concentration. Both parameters were shown to be
   statistically invariant, despite soil and site differences. This was
   determined using analysis of variance with normalized nonlinear
   regression of the ELM on the data from the study. This analysis lends
   further evidence that there are common parameters involved in the ELM
   that do not rely on site-specific or situation-specific factors. More
   insight into the derivation of, definition of, and logic behind the
   various parameters involved in the model are also given in this paper.}},

Title = {{Effect of injection screen slot geometry on hydraulic conductivity tests}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{511}},
Pages = {{190-198}},
Month = {{APR 16}},
Abstract = {{Hydraulic conductivity and its spatial variability are important
   hydrogeological parameters and are typically determined through
   injection tests at different scales. For injection test interpretation,
   shape factors are required to account for injection screen geometry.
   Shape factors act as proportionality constants between hydraulic
   conductivity and observed ratios of injection flow rate and injection
   head at steady-state. Existing results for such shape factors assume
   either an ideal screen (i.e., ignoring effects of screen slot geometry)
   or infinite screen length (i.e., ignoring effects of screen extremes).
   In the present work, we investigate the combined effects of
   circumferential screen slot geometry and finite screen length on
   injection shape factors. This is done in terms of a screen entrance
   resistance by solving a steady-state potential flow mixed type boundary
   value problem in a homogeneous axi-symmetric flow domain using a
   semi-analytical solution approach. Results are compared to existing
   analytical solutions for circumferential and longitudinal slots on
   infinite screens, which are found to be identical. Based on an existing
   approximation, an expression is developed for a dimensionless screen
   entrance resistance of infinite screens, which is a function of the
   relative slot area only. For anisotropic conditions, e.g., when
   conductivity is smaller in the vertical direction than in the
   horizontal, screen entrance losses for circumferential slots increase,
   while they remain unaffected for longitudinal slots. This work is not
   concerned with investigating the effects of (possibly turbulent) head
   losses inside the injection device including the passage through the
   injection slots prior to entering the porous aquifer. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {{Impact of plant growth and morphology and of sediment concentration on
   sediment retention efficiency of vegetative filter strips: Flume
   experiments and VFSMOD modeling}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{511}},
Pages = {{800-810}},
Month = {{APR 16}},
Abstract = {{Vegetative filter strips (VFS) implemented downstream to the source of
   pollution can trap sediments and thus limit sediment export from
   agricultural fields. However, their retention efficiencies are
   determined by many factors, among others the type of plant species and
   its growth stage. The impact of plant growth and morphology, as well as
   of incoming sediment concentration, on the efficiency of VFS to trap
   sediments was assessed by means of an experimental flume. Two different
   plant species were tested, Lolium perenne and Trifolium repens, after 2
   and 4 months of plant growth and for 2 different incoming silty-loam
   sediment concentrations. Measured retention efficiencies were compared
   to simulated values using VFSMOD based on goodness-of-fit indicators
   that take into account uncertainty linked to the measurements.
   The sediment storage capacity upstream of the VFS was limited in terms
   of mass, and therefore an increase in sediment concentration led to a
   decrease in sediment retention efficiency. After 2 months of plant
   growth, plant morphology affected the VFS potential to trap sediments,
   as reflected in the higher retention efficiency of T. repens due to its
   creeping shoot architecture. However, plant growth and development
   modified the plant morphology and VFS trapping potential. Indeed, L.
   perenne VFS retention efficiency increased from 35\% after 2 months of
   growth to 50\% after 4 months, due to the tillering capacity of grass
   species. Conversely, the trapping efficiency of T. repens decreased from
   49\% to 40\% after 4 months. This highlights the possible degradation of
   VFS with time, which in the case of T. repens was due to an increased
   heterogeneity of plant density within the strips. These modifications of
   plant characteristics with growth stage, which affected sediment
   trapping efficiencies, can be effectively integrated into mechanistic
   models like VFSMOD, mainly through stem spacing and Manning's surface
   roughness coefficient inputs. Since these parameters were highly
   conditioned by plant growth and development, modelers should take into
   account plant dynamics and select plant parameters related to the actual
   field conditions. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The notion of drawdown is central to active portfolio management.
   Conditional Drawdown-at-Risk (CDaR) is defined as the average of a
   specified percentage of the largest drawdowns over an investment horizon
   and includes maximum and average drawdowns as particular cases. The
   necessary optimality conditions for a portfolio optimization problem
   with CDaR yield the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) stated in both
   single and multiple sample-path settings. The drawdown beta in the CAPM
   has a simple interpretation and is evaluated for hedge fund indices from
   the HFRX database in the single sample-path setting. Drawdown alpha is
   introduced similarly to the alpha in the classical CAPM and is evaluated
   for the same hedge fund indices. Both drawdown beta and drawdown alpha
   are used to prioritize hedge fund strategies and to identify instruments
   for hedging against market drawdowns. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A novel engineered biochar with clay particles distributed on carbon
   surfaces within the biochar matrix has been successfully developed as a
   low-cost adsorbent for environmental applications. Three biomass
   feedstocks were pretreated with montmorillonite or kaolinite suspensions
   and then pyrolyzed at 600 degrees C for 1 h in a N-2 environment.
   Physicochemical characterizations including microscopy and X-ray
   analyses confirmed clay particles were present on the surface of biochar
   during the annealing process. Laboratory adsorption experiments
   indicated that the presence of clay particles on carbon surfaces had
   dramatically increased (about 5 times) the biochars' adsorption ability
   to methylene blue (MB). In addition, the clay-biochar composites could
   be recycled and reused after dye adsorption with a stable capacity of
   around 7.90 mg g(-1). The experimental results also showed that the
   sorption of MB on the clay-biochar composites is mainly controlled by
   the ion exchange (with clay) and electrostatic attraction (with biochar)
   mechanisms. Findings from this work indicate that engineered biochar,
   prepared from two low-cost materials (clay and biochar), is a valuable
   adsorbent for removing contaminants from aqueous solutions. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Growth of nanorods with a large bandgap core (zinc selenite or ZnSe) and

   microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), photoluminescence (PL) and
   UV-vis absorption, It was found that the ZnSe core was not uniformly
   covered by CdSe. Instead, the nanorods resulted from self-assembly of
   prolate nanospheres by aligned attachment. The PL from the pure ZnSe
   exhibited some small quantum confinement red shifting for short growth
   times, but the emission peak stabilized at 440 nm after growth for
   longer than 2 h at 280 degrees C. When Cd precursors were added to grow
   CdSe, the PL emission peak red-shifted to wavelengths greater than 600
   rim, and up to 660 nm. TEM data showed nonuniform diffraction along the
   nanorod and XRD showed formation of a ternary compound with an average
   stoichiometry or Cd0.2Zn0.8Se. These data are only consistent with
   inhomogeneous nanorods, and a schematic representation of

   morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) between room temperature rhombohedral
   and tetragonal phases at approximately x = 0.5. In the present work, in
   situ X-ray diffraction measurements during electric field application
   are used to elucidate the origin of electromechanical strain in several
   compositions spanning the tetragonal compositional range 0.6 <= x <=
   0.9. As BCT concentration decreases towards the MPB, the tetragonal
   distortion (given by c/a-1) decreases concomitantly with an increase in
   90 degrees domain wall motion. The increase in observed macroscopic
   strain is predominantly attributed to the increased contribution from 90
   degrees domain wall motion. The results demonstrate that domain wall
   motion is a significant factor in achieving high strain and
   piezoelectric coefficients in lead-free polycrystalline piezoelectrics.

Title = {{Dynamic Social Community Detection and Its Applications}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 10}},
Abstract = {{Community structure is one of the most commonly observed features of
   Online Social Networks (OSNs) in reality. The knowledge of this feature
   is of great advantage: it not only provides helpful insights into
   developing more efficient social-aware solutions but also promises a
   wide range of applications enabled by social and mobile networking, such
   as routing strategies in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) and worm
   containment in OSNs. Unfortunately, understanding this structure is very
   challenging, especially in dynamic social networks where social
   interactions are evolving rapidly. Our work focuses on the following
   questions: How can we efficiently identify communities in dynamic social
   networks? How can we adaptively update the network community structure
   based on its history instead of recomputing from scratch? To this end,
   we present Quick Community Adaptation (QCA), an adaptive
   modularity-based framework for not only discovering but also tracing the
   evolution of network communities in dynamic OSNs. QCA is very fast and
   efficient in the sense that it adaptively updates and discovers the new
   community structure based on its history together with the network
   changes only. This flexible approach makes QCA an ideal framework
   applicable for analyzing large-scale dynamic social networks due to its
   lightweight computing-resource requirement. To illustrate the
   effectiveness of our framework, we extensively test QCA on both
   synthesized and real-world social networks including Enron, arXiv
   e-print citation, and Facebook networks. Finally, we demonstrate the
   applicability of QCA in real applications: (1) A social-aware message
   forwarding strategy in MANETs, and (2) worm propagation containment in
   OSNs. Competitive results in comparison with other methods reveal that
   social-based techniques employing QCA as a community detection core
   outperform current available methods.}},

Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{2086-2093}},
Month = {{APR 10}},
Abstract = {{Highly cross-linked polyurethanes have a high elastic modulus and creep
   resistance, but they undergo a brittle fracture below the glass
   transition temperature. The lack of substantial toughness in these
   polymers limits their use in practical engineering applications. One
   method that has shown promise in recent years is the creation of local
   regions of reduced modulus that absorb strain energy and act to toughen
   the polymer. For instance, rubbers are typically added to epoxy which
   phase separate upon polymerization and create local elastic regions that
   significantly toughen the polymer. Here a variety of two-phase
   polyurethanes in the form of single inclusions is designed to study the
   toughening mechanism of the local regions of reduced modulus with an
   embedded crack. Synthesized heterogeneous polyurethanes show a
   transition from brittle to ductile behavior in addition to a drastic
   increase in the maximum load that the polymer can withstand. Fracture
   mechanics experiments demonstrate that a small reduction in the
   inclusion's Young's modulus (similar to 10\%) leads to an increase in
   the toughness by factor of 7 (similar to 700\%). The finite element
   method and digital image correlation are utilized to study this
   toughening mechanism. Optical strain measurements confirm the numerical
   simulation results and possible toughening and strengthening mechanisms.

Abstract = {{We report on quadrupolar (donor)(2)-acceptor sensitizers for

   dithieno{[}2,3-a:3',2'-c]phenazine and
   dithieno{[}3,2-a:2',3'-c]phenazine coupled to thiophene donors. The
   optoelectronic and photophysical properties of two sets of isomers
   reveal a rigid structure for linear isomers and an efficient
   nonradiative decay for branched isomers. These sensitizers were
   integrated into DSSCs, and the quadrupolar structure is an operational
   design, as the IPCE reached up to 38\% from 400 nm to 600 nm. The
   lengthening of the donor chain increases the efficiency, demonstrating
   the appeal of these oligomeric dyes for DSSCs.}},

Abstract = {{The silver-doped titanium dioxide (Ag-TiO2) photocatalysts with varied
   silver content ranging from 0.75 at \% to 3.5 at \% were synthesized by
   a single-step sol-gel method. The role of silver content on the
   properties of photocatalyst has been studied. The doping of 0.75 at \%
   silver in TiO2 produced thermally stable TiO2 anatase phase with
   smallest particle size, uniform particles size and morphology, high
   surface area and low-energy excitation characteristics. The Ag-TiO2
   sample with 0.75 at \% silver possesses predominantly finely dispersed
   silver species (Ag2O and AgO) on the surface. The proportion of surface
   agglomerated silver metal (Ag-0) increases as the silver content in the
   Ag-TiO2 sample increases. The silver oxide species were observed to be
   responsible for better physicochemical and catalytic properties. The
   TiO2 with 0.75 at \% silver was found to be an efficient photocatalyst
   showing enhanced photocatalytic activity for aqueous medium
   photocatalytic degradation of phthalic acid in the presence of UV

Abstract = {{The original MOUDI (Micro-Orifice Uniform Deposit Impactor) cascade
   impactor, reported in the literature in 1991, used an external gear
   system to achieve a uniform deposit and was intended for industrial
   hygiene studies with sample times in the range of minutes to a few
   hours. To facilitate much longer run times, a second generation MOUDI,
   MOUDI-II, which uses internal electric motors to rotate the impaction
   plates, was developed. Three model 120 MOUDI-IIs were used in a 32-month
   program to sample ambient atmospheric aerosols at several industrial and
   urban locations in Minnesota. For these sampling locations, each 120
   MOUDI-II operated continuously for a minimum of five, and optimally
   7days, to collect a sample at a site. During these community sampling
   events, the three 120 MOUDI-IIs logged 4007, 2637, and 3230h of
   operating time, respectively. A laboratory side-by-side comparison of
   the three 120 MOUDI-IIs showed good agreement amongst the three 120
   MOUDI-IIs and, thus, the particle size distributions were independent of
   the 120 MOUDI-II used. Application of the 120 MOUDI-IIs for long-term
   ambient sampling was demonstrated by comparing size distributions from
   the background locations: Minneapolis, Duluth and Ely, Minnesota,
   representing urban, light industrial, and pristine area type of
   aerosols, respectively. PM2.5 averages from Minneapolis and Duluth
   compare well with three-year averages from state regulatory sampling.

Abstract = {{In the lower part of an ironmaking blast furnace, a hot air jet is
   injected horizontally into a bed of coke particles, forming a void zone,
   called a ``raceway{''}. In this paper, two-fluid gas-solid modeling is
   used to study the influence of various operational parameters on the
   size and shape of the raceway (void zone). The model employs
   state-of-the-art closure relations to describe solid-phase stress, which
   then incorporates frictional forces based on soil mechanics, and
   k-epsilon equations to describe gas-phase stress. The results show that
   raceway size and shape depend on jet velocity, outlet pressure, particle
   size, bed height, height of the jet inlet and the particle downward
   extraction rate. The influence of jet injection angle, domain geometry,
   and initial porosity on the raceway properties are found to be
   insignificant for the investigated range, although changing initial
   porosity suggests a small degree of hysteresis.}},

Abstract = {{Critical node detection problems aim to optimally delete a subset of
   nodes in order to optimize or restrict a certain metric of network
   fragmentation. In this paper, we consider two network disruption metrics
   which have recently received substantial attention in the literature:
   the size of the remaining connected components and the total number of
   node pairs connected by a path. Exact solution methods known to date are
   based on linear 0-1 formulations with at least Theta (n(3)) entities and
   allow one to solve these problems to optimality only in small sparse
   networks with up to 150 nodes. In this work, we develop more compact
   linear 0-1 formulations for the considered types of problemswith Theta
   (n(2)) entities. We also provide reformulations and valid inequalities
   that improve the performance of the developed models. Computational
   experiments show that the proposed formulations allow finding exact
   solutions to the considered problems for real-world sparse networks up
   to 10 times larger and with CPU time up to 1,000 times faster compared
   to previous studies.}},

Title = {{Sustained AAV-mediated overexpression of CRF in the central amygdala
   diminishes the depressive-like state associated with nicotine withdrawal}},
Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Smoking cessation leads to a dysphoric state and this increases the risk
   for relapse. Animal studies indicate that the dysphoric state associated
   with nicotine withdrawal is at least partly mediated by an increase in
   corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) release in the central nucleus of
   the amygdala (CeA). In the present study, we investigated whether a
   sustained overexpression of CRF in the CeA affects the dysphoric-like
   state associated with nicotine withdrawal. To study brain reward
   function, rats were prepared with intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS)
   electrodes in the medial forebrain bundle. An adeno-associated virus
   (AAV, pseudotype 2/5) was used to overexpress CRF or green fluorescent
   protein (GFP, control) in the CeA and minipumps were used to induce
   nicotine dependence. The AAV2/5-CRF vector induced a 40\% increase in
   CRF protein and mRNA levels in the CeA. Administration of the nicotinic
   receptor antagonist mecamylamine (precipitated withdrawal) or nicotine
   pump removal (spontaneous withdrawal) led to elevations in ICSS
   thresholds. Elevations in ICSS thresholds are indicative of a
   dysphoric-like state. The overexpression of CRF did not affect baseline
   ICSS thresholds but diminished the elevations in ICSS thresholds
   associated with precipitated and spontaneous nicotine withdrawal. The
   real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis showed that the
   overexpression of CRF led to a decrease in CRF1 mRNA levels and an
   increase in CRF2 mRNA levels in the CeA. In conclusion, the
   overexpression of CRF in the CeA diminishes the dysphoric-like state
   associated with nicotine withdrawal and this might be driven by
   neuroadaptive changes in CRF1 and CRF2 receptor gene expression.}},

Abstract = {{Remotely sensed vegetation indices have been extensively used to
   quantify plant and soil characteristics. The objectives of this study
   were to: (i) compare vegetation indices developed at different scales
   for measuring canopy N content (g center dot N center dot m(-2)) and
   concentration (\%); and (ii) evaluate the effects of soil background
   reflectance, cultivar, illumination and atmospheric conditions on the
   ability of vegetation indices to estimate canopy N content. Data were
   collected from two rainfed field sites cropped to wheat in Southern
   Italy (Foggia) and in Southeastern Australia (Horsham). From spectral
   readings, 25 vegetation indices were calculated. The Perpendicular
   Vegetation Index showed the best prediction of plant N concentration
   (\%) (r(2) = 0.81; standard error (SE) = 0.41\%; p < 0.001). The Canopy
   Chlorophyll Content Index showed the best predictive capability for
   canopy N content (g center dot N center dot m(-2)) (r(2) = 0.73; SE =
   0.603; p < 0.001). Canopy N content was best related to indices
   developed at the canopy scale and containing a red-edge wavelength.
   Canopy-scale indices were related to canopy N\%, but such relationships
   needed to be normalized with biomass. Geographical location influenced
   mainly simple ratio or normalized indices, while indices that contained
   red-edge wavelengths were more robust and able to estimate canopy
   parameters more accurately.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, a full dynamic data-driven application system (DDDAS)
   is proposed for dynamically estimating a concentration plume and
   planning optimal paths for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with
   environmental sensors. The proposed DDDAS dynamically incorporates
   measured data from UAVs into an environmental simulation while
   simultaneously steering measurement processes. In order to assimilate
   incomplete and noisy state observations into this system in real-time,
   the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is used to estimate the plume
   concentration by matching partial observations with pre-computed
   dominant modes in a least-square sense. In order to maximize the
   information gain, UAVs are dynamically driven to hot spots chosen based
   on the POD modes. Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) techniques are
   used for UAV guidance with collision and obstacle avoidance. We
   demonstrate the efficacy of the data assimilation and control strategies
   in numerical simulations. Especially, a single UAV outperforms the ten
   static sensors in this scenario in terms of the mean square error over
   the full time interval. Additionally, the multi-vehicle data collection
   scenarios outperform the single vehicle scenarios for both static
   sensors at optimal positions and UAVs controlled by SPH.}},

Abstract = {{The power, water extraction, and refrigeration (PoWER) system generates
   electric power, potable water and refrigeration effects simultaneously,
   and is composed of a micro-turbine and vapor absorption refrigeration
   system, which typically uses ammonia, heat exchangers, and a
   turbocharger. In order to improve the efficiency and the electric output
   power of the micro-turbine portion of the PoWER system, attempts have
   previously been made to reduce the inlet temperature of the compressor.
   However, it was problematic to drive it below the freezing point since
   frost or ice forms from the humidity in re-circulated air. As a result,
   the ice accretion that attaches on the bell mouth or guide vane might
   increase the pressure drop, leading to performance loss. Furthermore,
   large sections that break from the ice accretion may cause damage to the
   compressor blades. In this paper experiments have been conducted under
   the same environmental conditions as the PoWER system in order to
   observe the physical characteristic of the frost formation on
   cylindrical tubes. The results show the thickness of the frost formation
   for different air velocities (3, 5, 7 m/s) and surface temperatures
   (-9.8, -16.6, -24.4A degrees C) with respect to time.}},

Abstract = {{Wheat prolamins, commonly known as gluten, are a complex mixture of
   71-78 proteins, which constitute similar to 80\% of the proteins in the
   wheat grains and supply 50\% of the global dietary protein demand.
   Prolamins are also responsible for numerous gluten-induced disorders and
   determine the unique visco-elastic properties of the wheat dough. These
   properties necessitate the reliable determination of the prolamin
   composition in wheat grains and their derived products. Therefore, this
   study examined the impact of HPLC conditions, including column type,
   column temperature, flow rate, and the gradient of polar and non-polar
   solvents in the mobile phase, to improve the analytical resolution of
   prolamins. The following conditions were found optimal for analyses:
   column temperature 60 degrees C, flow rate 1.0 mL/min and an elution
   gradient of 20\%-60\% of 0.1\% trifluoroacetic acid + acetonitrile in 60
   min. For further improvement of resolution, gliadin and glutenin
   extracts were analyzed using MALDI-TOF-MS in combination with HPLC
   fractionation. Two semi-quantitative methods, densitometry of stained
   polyacrylamide gels and HPLC, were used to determine relative prolamin
   quantities and the correspondence between the methods was established.
   The combinatorial gluten analyses approach developed during the present
   study was used to analyze prolamin profiles of wheat transformants
   expressing DEMETER silencing artificial microRNA, and the results are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Interfacial linear and internal angular momentum balances are obtained
   for a structured continuum and for the special case of a ferrofluid, a
   suspension of magnetic nanoparticles in a Newtonian fluid. The
   interfacial balance equations account for the effects of surface tension
   and surface tension gradient, magnetic surface excess forces,
   antisymmetric stresses, and couple stresses in driving interfacial flows
   in ferrofluids. Application of the interfacial balance equations is
   illustrated by obtaining analytical expressions for the translational
   and spin velocity profiles in a thin film of ferrofluid on an infinite
   flat plate when a rotating magnetic field is applied with axis of
   rotation parallel to the ferrofluid/air interface. The cases of zero and
   non-zero spin viscosity are considered for small applied magnetic field
   amplitude. Expressions for the maximum translational velocity, slope of
   the translational velocity profile at the ferrofluid/air interface, and
   volumetric flow rate are obtained and their use to test the relevance of
   spin viscosity and couple stresses in the flow situation under
   consideration is discussed. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The macroscopic properties of two-dimensional random periodic packs of
   monomodal and bimodal cylinders are investigated by means of numerical
   methods. We solve the unsteady, two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations
   on a staggered Cartesian grid and use the immersed boundary method to
   treat internal flow boundaries. A number of verification problems for
   the numerical method are presented. The effects of porosity, diameter
   ratio, large-to-total particle ratio, and Reynolds number on the
   macroscopic permeability are studied. For small Reynolds numbers, we
   show that the permeability can be correlated to the underlying
   microstructure by means of a suitably defined statistical descriptor,
   the mean shortest Delaunay edge. With proper scaling, the results for
   bimodal cylinders collapse onto the data for monomodal cylinders, which
   can then be fitted with a universal curve. For larger Reynolds numbers
   we show that a modified Forchheimer equation can characterize the flow.

   slightly increased along with the rise of testing temperature and time.
   Moreover, the nanostructural equiaxed grains with the similar size of

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. This study aimed to elucidate the role of connective tissue
   growth factor (CTGF) in healthy eyes and wounded corneas of mice and
   rabbits. Conditional knockout mice were used to determine the role of
   CTGF in corneal healing.
   METHODS. CTGF expression was determined using transgenic mice carrying
   CTGF promoter driven-eGFP, quantitative RT-PCR, and immunofluorescent
   staining. Mice that carried two floxed CTGF alleles and a Cre/ERT2
   transgene under the control of human ubiquitin C (ubc) promoter were
   used to conditionally delete CTGF gene in a tamoxifen-inducible manner.
   Phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) was used to generate an acute corneal
   wound and corneal re-epithelialization was assessed by fluorescein
   staining.
   RESULTS. Connective tissue growth factor expression was found in
   multiple ocular tissues with relatively high levels in the corneal
   endothelium, lens subcapsular epithelium, and in the vasculature of the
   iris and retina. Wounded corneas responded with an immediate
   upregulation of CTGF in the epithelium at the wound margin and a
   sustained CTGF induction during re-epithelialization. At the onset of
   haze formation, CTGF protein becomes more focused in the basal
   epithelium. Deletion of the CTGF gene caused a 40\% reduction (P < 0.01)
   in the cornea re-epithelialization rate in knockout mice compared with
   wild-type mice.
   CONCLUSIONS. Connective tissue growth factor is expressed in the naive
   cornea, lens, iris, and retina, and is expressed immediately after
   epithelial injury. Loss of CTGF impairs efficient reepithelialization of
   corneal wounds.}},

Abstract = {{The notions of passivity and positive realness are fundamental concepts
   in classical control theory, but the use of the terms has varied. For
   LTI systems, these two concepts capture the same essential property of
   dynamical systems, that is, a system with this property does not
   generate its own energy but only stores and dissipates energy supplied
   by the environment. This paper summarizes the connection between these
   two concepts for continuous and discrete time LTI systems. Beyond that,
   relationships are provided between classes of strictly passive systems
   and classes of positive real systems. The more general framework of
   dissipativity is introduced to connect passivity and positive realness
   and also to survey other energy-based results. The frameworks of
   passivity indices and conic systems are discussed to connect to
   passivity and dissipativity. After surveying relevant existing results,
   some clarifying results are presented. These involve connections between
   classes of passive systems and finite-gain L-2 stability as well as
   asymptotic stability. Additional results are given to clarify some of
   the more subtle conditions between classes of these systems and
   stability results. This paper surveys existing connections between
   classes of passive and positive real systems and provides results that
   clarify more subtle connections between these concepts. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an aggregation-based model reduction method for
   nonlinear models of multi-zone building thermal dynamics. The full-order
   model, which is already a lumped-parameter approximation, quickly grows
   in state space dimension as the number of zones increases. An advantage
   of the proposed method, apart from being applicable to the nonlinear
   thermal models, is that the reduced model obtained has the same
   structure and physical intuition as the original model. The key to the
   methodology is an analogy between a continuous-time Markov chain and the
   linear part of the thermal dynamics. A recently developed
   aggregation-based method of Markov chains is employed to aggregate the
   large state space of the full-order model into a smaller one.

Title = {{Climate-induced yield variability and yield gaps of maize (Zea mays L.)
   in the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia}},
Journal = {{FIELD CROPS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{160}},
Pages = {{41-53}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{There is a high demand for quantitative information on impacts of
   climate on crop yields, yield gaps and their variability in Ethiopia,
   yet, quantitative studies that include an indication of uncertainties in
   the estimates are rare. A multi-model crop growth simulation approach
   using the two crop models, i.e. Decision Support System for
   Agro-Technology (DSSAT) and WOrld FOod STudies (WOFOST) was applied to
   characterize climate-induced variability and yield gaps of maize. The
   models were calibrated and evaluated with experimental data from the
   Central Rift Valley (CRV) in Ethiopia. Subsequently, a simulation
   experiment was carried out with an early maturing (Melkassa1) and a late
   maturing (BH540) cultivar using historical weather data (1984-2009) of
   three locations in the CRV. Yield gaps were computed as differences
   among simulated water-limited yield, on-farm trial yields and average
   actual farmers' yields.
   The simulation experiment revealed that the potential yield (average
   across three sites and 1984-2009) is 8.2-9.2 and 6.8-7.1 Mg/ha for the
   late maturing and early maturing cultivars, respectively; ranges
   indicate mean differences between the two models. The simulated
   water-limited yield (averaged across three sites and 1984-2009) is
   7.2-7.9 Mg/ha for the late maturing and 6.1-6.7 Mg/ha for the early
   maturing cultivar. The water-limited yield shows high inter-annual
   variability (CV 36\%) and about 60\% of this variability in yield is
   explained by the variation in growing season rainfall. The gap between
   average farmers yield and simulated water-limited yield ranges from 4.7
   to 6.0 Mg/ha. The average farmers' yields were 2.0-2.3 Mg/ha, which is
   about 1.1-3.1 Mg/ha lower than on-farm trial yields. In relative terms,
   average farmers' yields are 28-30\% of the water-limited yield and
   44-65\% of on-farm trial yields. Analysis of yield gaps for different
   number of years to drive average yields indicates that yield gap
   estimation on the basis of few years may result in misleading
   conclusions. Approximately ten years of data are required to be able to
   estimate yield gaps for the Central Rift Valley in a robust manner.
   Existing yield gaps indicate that there is scope for significantly
   increasing maize yield in the CRV and other, similar agro-ecological
   zones in Africa, through improved crop and climate risk management
   strategies. As crop models differ in detail of describing the complex,
   dynamic processes of crop growth, water use and soil water balances, the
   multi-model approach provides information on the uncertainty in
   simulating crop-climate interactions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   the iterative adaptive approach (IAA) and the sparse learning via
   iterative minimization (SLIM) method, are considered for range-Doppler
   imaging via multistatic active sonar. The so-obtained range-Doppler
   images allow us to further estimate the target parameters. Specifically,
   we use the popular quasi-Newton method for target position estimation
   and the least squares (LS) fitting approach for target velocity

Volume = {{241}},
Pages = {{366-375}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{The overall goal of this research was to evaluate an innovative combined
   ion-exchange process for multi-contaminant treatment. Magnetically
   enhanced anion exchange resin and conventional cation exchange resin
   were used in a single completely mixed vessel for simultaneous removal
   of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and hardness. Following treatment,
   exhausted anion exchange resin and cation exchange resin were
   regenerated together in a single completely mixed vessel using sodium
   chloride (NaCl). The performance of the combined ion-exchange process
   was evaluated using three groundwaters and two nanofiltration (NF)
   membrane concentrates. The test waters provided a wide range of water
   quality in terms of DOC (2.9-56 mg/L), total hardness (300-1000 mg/L as
   CaCO3), and sulfate (10-830 mg/L). Combined ion-exchange treatment of
   groundwater achieved 76\% DOC removal and 97\% total hardness removal
   using a 20\% (m/v) NaCl regeneration solution. Combined ion-exchange
   also achieved high removals of DOC (e.g., 83\%) and total hardness
   (e.g., 86\%) from NF concentrate using a 30\% (m/v) NaCl regeneration
   solution. These results provide water treatment engineers with a new
   application of ion-exchange that can be used in place coagulation and
   precipitative softening or as an intermediate treatment step between
   primary and secondary NF or reverse osmosis membranes. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We infer peak currents from radiation electric field peaks of 48
   positive return strokes acquired in Gainesville, FL, USA, from 2007 to
   2008. In doing so, we use the transmission line model, National
   Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) - reported distances, and assumed
   return-stroke speed. From a similar analysis of negative subsequent
   strokes, it appears that the implied return-stroke speed in the NLDN
   field-to-current conversion equation is 1.8 x 10(8) m/s (the NLDN peak
   current estimation algorithm is calibrated for negative subsequent
   strokes). The NLDN uses the same field-to-current conversion procedure
   (and hence the same implied return-stroke speed) for positive return
   strokes. However, NLDN-reported peak currents for positive return
   strokes differ from peak currents predicted by the transmission line
   model with an assumed return-stroke speed of 1.8 x 10(8) m/s. The
   discrepancy between regression equations for negative and positive
   return strokes suggests that the NLDN procedure to compensate for field
   propagation effects and find the average range-normalized signal
   strength (RNSS) works differently for these two groups of strokes. We
   find that the difference can be explained by the bias toward NLDN sensor
   reports from larger distances for positive strokes combined with the
   higher relative sensor gain (the ratio of sensor's peak current estimate
   to the NLDN-reported peak current) at larger distances.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes our efforts to design a cognitive architecture for

   work proposes a Bayesian approach to object recognition in video, using
   a hierarchical, distributed architecture of dynamic processing elements
   that learns in a self-organizing way to cluster objects in the video
   input. A biologically inspired innovation is to implement a top-down
   pathway across layers in the form of causes, creating effectively a
   bidirectional processing architecture with feedback. To simplify
   discrimination, overcomplete representations are utilized. Both
   inference and parameter learning are performed using empirical priors,
   while imposing appropriate sparseness constraints. Preliminary results
   show that the cognitive architecture has features that resemble the
   functional organization of the early visual cortex. One example showing
   the use of top-down connections is given to disambiguate a synthetic

Abstract = {{Understanding colloid and colloid-facilitated contaminant transport in
   overland flow through dense vegetation is important to protect water
   quality in the environment, especially for water bodies receiving
   agricultural and urban runoff. In previous studies, a single-stem
   efficiency theory for rigid and clean stem systems was developed to
   predict colloid filtration by plant stems of vegetation in laminar
   overland flow. Hence, in order to improve the accuracy of the
   single-stem efficiency theory to real dense vegetation system, we
   incorporated the effect of natural organic matter (NOM) on the
   filtration of colloids by stems. Laboratory dense vegetation flow
   chamber experiments and model simulations were used to determine the
   kinetic deposition (filtration) rate of colloids under various
   conditions. The results show that, in addition to flow hydrodynamics and
   solution chemistry, steric repulsion afforded by NOM layer on the plants
   stem surface also plays a significant role in controlling colloid
   deposition on vegetation in overland flow. For the first time, a refined
   single-stem efficiency theory with considerations of the NOM effect is
   developed that describes the experimental data with good accuracy. This
   theory can be used to not only help construct and refine mathematical
   models of colloid transport in real vegetation systems in overland flow,
   but also inform the development of theories of colloid deposition on
   NOM-coated surfaces in natural, engineered, and biomedical systems.}},

Abstract = {{Development of sensitive and specific imaging approaches for the
   detection of ovarian cancer holds great promise for improving survival
   of ovarian cancer patients. Here we describe a dual-modality
   photoacoustic and fluorescence molecular tomography (PAT/FMT) approach
   in combination with a targeted imaging probe for three-dimensional
   imaging of ovarian tumors in mice. We found that the selective
   accumulation of the HER-2/neu targeted magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles
   (IONPs) led to about 5-fold contrast enhancements in the tumor for PAT,
   while near-infrared (NIR) dye labeled nanoparticles emitted strong
   optical signals for FMT. Both PAT and FMT were demonstrated to be able
   to detect ovarian tumors located deep in the peritoneal cavity in mice.
   The targeted nanoprobes allowed mapping tumors in high resolution via
   PAT, and high sensitivity and specificity via FMT. This study
   demonstrated the potential of the application of HER-2/neutargeted
   PAT/FMT approach for non-invasive or intraoperative imaging of ovarian
   cancer.

   dual-modality photoacoustic and fluorescence molecular tomography
   approach in combination with a targeted imaging probe for
   three-dimensional imaging of ovarian tumors in a mouse model,

Abstract = {{Macrophages are the primary mediator of chronic inflammatory responses
   to implanted biomaterials, in cases when the material is either in
   particulate or bulk form. Chronic inflammation limits the performance
   and functional life of numerous implanted medical devices, and
   modulating macrophage interactions with biomaterials to mitigate this
   response would be beneficial. The integrin family of cell surface
   receptors mediates cell adhesion through binding to adhesive proteins
   nonspecifically adsorbed onto biomaterial surfaces. In this work, the
   roles of integrin Mac-1 (alpha(M)beta(2)) and RGD-binding integrins were
   investigated using model systems for both particulate and bulk
   biomaterials. Specifically, the macrophage functions of phagocytosis and
   inflammatory cytokine secretion in response to a model particulate
   material, polystyrene microparticles were investigated. Opsonizing
   proteins modulated microparticle uptake, and integrin Mac-1 and
   RGD-binding integrins were found to control microparticle uptake in an
   opsonin-dependent manner. The presence of adsorbed endotoxin did not
   affect microparticle uptake levels, but was required for the production
   of inflammatory cytokines in response to microparticles. Furthermore, it
   was demonstrated that integrin Mac-1 and RGD-binding integrins influence
   the in vivo foreign body response to a bulk biomaterial, subcutaneously
   implanted polyethylene terephthalate. A thinner foreign body capsule was
   formed when integrin Mac-1 was absent (similar to 30\% thinner) or when
   RGD-binding integrins were blocked by controlled release of a blocking
   peptide (similar to 45\% thinner). These findings indicate integrin
   Mac-1 and RGD-binding integrins are involved and may serve as
   therapeutic targets to mitigate macrophage inflammatory responses to
   both particulate and bulk biomaterials. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{A simplified approach to address turbulence modulation in turbidity
   currents as a response to slope breaks and loss of lateral confinement}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Pages = {{371-385}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Turbidity currents traversing canyon-fan systems flow over bed slopes
   that decrease in the downstream direction. This slope decrease
   eventually causes turbidity currents to decelerate and enter a
   net-depositional mode. When the slope decrease is relatively rapid in
   the downstream direction, the turbidity current undergoes a
   concomitantly rapid and substantial transition. Similar conditions are
   found when turbidity currents debouch to fan systems with loss of
   lateral confinement. In this work a simplified approach to perform
   direct numerical simulation of continuous turbidity currents undergoing
   slope breaks and loss of lateral confinement is presented and applied to
   study turbulence modulation in the flow. The presence of settling
   sediment particles breaks the top-bottom symmetry of the flow, with a
   tendency to self-stratify. This self-stratification damps turbulence,
   particularly near the bottom wall, affecting substantially the flow's
   ability to transport sediment in suspension. This work reports results
   on two different situations: turbidity currents driven by fine and
   coarser sediment flowing through a decreasing slope. In the case of fine
   sediment, after the reduction in the slope of the channel, the flow
   remains turbulent with only a modest influence on turbulence statistics.
   In the case of coarse sediments, after the change in slope, turbulence
   is totally suppressed.}},

Title = {{Electrochemical effects of isolated voids in uranium dioxide}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{550-557}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{We present a model to study the electrochemical effects of voids in
   oxide materials under equilibrium conditions and apply this model to
   uranium dioxide. Based on thermodynamic arguments, we claim that voids
   in uranium dioxide must contain oxygen gas at a pressure that we
   determine via a Kelvin equation in terms of temperature, void radius and
   the oxygen pressure of the outside gas reservoir in equilibrium with the
   oxide. The oxygen gas within a void gives rise to ionosorption and the
   formation of a layer of surface-charge on the void surface, which, in
   turn, induces an influence zone of space charge into the matrix
   surrounding the void. Since the space charge is carried in part by
   atomic defects, it is concluded that, as a part of the thermodynamic
   equilibrium of oxides containing voids, the off-stoichiometry around the
   void is different from its remote bulk value. As such, in a uranium
   dioxide solid with a void ensemble, the average off-stoichiometry level
   in the material differs from that of the void-free counterpart. The
   model is applied to isolated voids in off-stoichiometric uranium dioxide
   for a wide range of temperature and disorder state of the oxide. (C)

Abstract = {{This study is concerned with a new method to apply consistent and known
   pretension to silicone rubber membranes intended for micro air vehicles.
   Pretension has a marked effect on the static and dynamic responses of
   membrane wings and controls the overall deflections, as such control and
   measurement of the membrane pretension are important. The technique
   developed employs thermal expansion to set the pretension and digital
   image correlation to assess the resulting spatial strain field. Two
   different frame geometries were fabricated to evaluate the technique.
   For open-cell frames, the pretension was not uniform, whereas it was for
   closed-cell frames. Results show developed full-field stress and strain
   fields as a function of membrane attachment temperature and frame
   geometry along with experimental iterations to prove repeatability. The
   membranes can be stretched to a specific pretension according to the
   temperature at which it adheres to frames.}},

Pages = {{59-66}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The sliding interfaces found in the body-within the eyes, the digestive
   system, and the articulating joints, for example-are soft and permeable
   yet extremely robust, possessing low friction. The common elements among
   these systems are hydrophilic biopolymer networks that provide physical
   surfaces, elasticity, and fluid permeability. Stiff, impermeable probes
   are traditionally used to assess the frictional properties of most
   surfaces, including soft, permeable materials. However, both sides of
   physiological articulating interfaces are soft and hydrated. Measuring
   the friction response on just one-half of the cornea-eyelid interface or
   the cartilage-cartilage interface using a stiff, impermeable probe may
   not reproduce physiological lubrication. Here, we present lubricity
   measurements of the interface between two soft, hydrated, and permeable
   hydrogels. We explore the distinctions between the self-mated
   ``Gemini{''} hydrogel interface and hydrogels sliding against hard
   impermeable countersurfaces. A rigid impermeable probe sliding against a
   soft permeable hydrogel exhibits strong frictional dependence on sliding
   speed, and a hydrogel probe sliding against flat glass shows a strong
   friction dependence on time in contact. The twin Gemini interface shows
   very low friction mu < 0.06, with little dependence on sliding speed or
   time in contact. This consistently low-friction Gemini interface
   emulates the physiological condition of two like permeable surfaces in
   contact, providing excellent lubricity.}},

Abstract = {{A 2-D rectangular cavity subject to a horizontal temperature gradient
   imposed on its upper boundary induces a naturally convective flow,
   leading to two surprising results. First, at large Rayleigh numbers (Ra)
   two boundary layers appear driving the flow in such a way that heat is
   removed from the cold part of the fluid and released into the hot region
   of the fluid, generating a dynamical ``heat pump{''}. Second, a narrow
   region of pulsating oscillatory flow appears in the vicinity of the
   boundary layer which is at the vertical wall adjoining the cold edge of
   the upper boundary. These pulsations occur when Ra exceeds a critical
   value, Ra-c, and are associated with large downward and upward vertical
   flows that appear simultaneously near this vertical wall. The rest of
   the cavity is principally a ``dead{''} cold region with weak flows. This
   region is the heat source of the heat pump. It occupies the main part of
   the cavity which progressively gets colder while the horizontal thermal
   boundary layer progressively gets hotter with increasing Ra. We explain
   the physics of these phenomena via numerical calculations that employ a
   spectral Chebyshev method. It is shown, for the first time, that the
   curve of Ra-c versus the aspect ratio is non-monotonic. It is also shown
   that the fundamental frequency of the oscillations, omega, increases
   monotonically with the aspect ratio of the cavity that we have
   considered. Physical reasons are advanced to explain our observations.

Abstract = {{In this paper, dislocation-phonon interactions in fcc crystals are
   simulated using the concurrent atomistic-continuum (CAC) method. With
   significantly less computational cost than that by full molecular
   dynamics (MD) simulations, dislocation migration, phonon transport, and
   their interactions are explicitly modeled. Sub-THz Phonon drag
   coefficients on moving dislocations are predicted using CAC and compared
   with MD and experimental results. During the interactions between
   phonons and dislocations, the local temperature is found to rise due to
   energy dissipation, and dislocations are observed to exhibit ``breathing
   modes{''} in which the separation between leading and trailing partials
   varies in time in a quasi-periodic fashion. Simulation results show that
   the phonon drag coefficient on dislocation migration increases with
   phonon wave packet magnitudes or sizes but is insensitive to the
   incident angles. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Extraction and testing of miniature compression specimens from localized
   regions of components affected by rolling contact fatigue loading can
   provide significant insight into material degradation. Current ASTM
   standards for compression testing of cylindrical specimens become too
   stringent and difficult to achieve when specimen size is reduced to
   around 1 mm in diameter. The tolerances for surface flatness,
   parallelism of the loading surfaces, and the perpendicularity between
   the axis and the loading surfaces play crucial roles in the resulting
   stress-strain curves under uniaxial compression loading. In this
   manuscript, a systematic study is performed to quantify the influence of
   the above geometric parameters on the stress-strain response. Based on
   the analysis, the allowable geometric tolerances of miniature
   cylindrical specimens for a valid compression tests are recommended. The
   analysis results are validated and the usefulness of the method is
   demonstrated on miniature specimens extracted from the rolling contact
   fatigue affected regions of high strength M50 bearing balls. The yield
   stress within the rolling contact fatigue affected region is shown to
   increase by over 12\%.}},

Title = {{`Extended spectral angle mapping (ESAM)' for citrus greening disease
   detection using airborne hyperspectral imaging}},
Journal = {{PRECISION AGRICULTURE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},

Pages = {{162-183}},

Abstract = {{Hyperspectral (HS) imaging is becoming more important for agricultural
   applications. Due to its high spectral resolution, it exhibits excellent
   performance in disease identification of different crops. In this study,
   a novel method termed `extended spectral angle mapping (ESAM)' was
   proposed to detect citrus greening disease (Huanglongbing or HLB), which
   is a very destructive disease of citrus. Firstly, the Savitzky-Golay
   smoothing filter was used to remove spectral noise within the data. A
   mask for tree canopy was built using support vector machine, to separate
   the tree canopies from the background. Pure endmembers of the masked
   dataset for healthy and HLB infected tree canopies were extracted using
   vertex component analysis. By utilizing the derived pure endmembers,
   spectral angle mapping was applied to differentiate between healthy and
   citrus greening disease infected areas in the image. Finally, most false
   positive detections were filtered out using red-edge position. An
   experiment was carried out using an HS image acquired by an airborne HS
   imaging system, and a multispectral image acquired by the WorldView-2
   satellite, from the Citrus Research and Education Center, Lake Alfred,
   FL, USA. Ground reflectance measurement and coordinates for diseased
   trees were recorded. The experimental results were compared with another
   supervised method, Mahalanobis distance, and an unsupervised method,
   K-means, both of which showed a 63.6 \% accuracy. The proposed ESAM
   performed better with a detection accuracy of 86 \% than those two
   methods. These results demonstrated that the detection accuracy using HS
   image could be enhanced by focusing on the pure endmember extraction and
   the use of red-edge position, suggesting that there is a great potential
   of citrus greening disease detection using an HS image.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problems of minimum-cost design and augmentation of
   directed network clusters that have diameter 2 and maintain the same
   diameter after the deletion of up to R elements (nodes or arcs) anywhere
   in the cluster. The property of a network to maintain not only the
   overall connectivity, but also the same diameter after the deletion of
   multiple nodes/arcs is referred to as strong attack tolerance. This
   paper presents the proof of NP-completeness of the decision version of
   the problem, derives tight theoretical bounds, as well as develops a
   heuristic algorithm for the considered problems, which are extremely
   challenging to solve to optimality even for small networks.
   Computational experiments suggest that the proposed heuristic algorithm
   does identify high-quality near-optimal solutions; moreover, in the
   special case of undirected networks with identical arc construction
   costs, the algorithm provably produces an exact optimal solution to
   strongly attack-tolerant two-hop network design problem, regardless of
   the network size.}},

Abstract = {{In social networks, there is a tendency for connected users to match
   each other's behaviors. Moreover, a user likely adopts a behavior, if a
   certain fraction of his family and friends follows that behavior.
   Identifying people who have the most influential effect to the others is
   of great advantages, especially in politics, marketing, behavior
   correction, and so on. Under a graph-theoretical framework, we study the
   positive influence dominating set (PIDS) problem that seeks for a
   minimal set of nodes such that all other nodes in the network have at
   least a fraction rho > 0 of their neighbors in . We also study a
   different formulation, called total positive influence dominating set
   (TPIDS), in which even nodes in are required to have a fraction rho of
   neighbors inside . We show that neither of these problems can be
   approximated within a factor of (1-I mu)lnmax\{Delta,|V|(1/2)\}, where
   Delta is the maximum degree. Moreover, we provide a simple proof that
   both problems can be approximated within a factor ln Delta+O(1). In
   power-law networks, where the degree sequence follows a power-law
   distribution, both problems admit constant factor approximation
   algorithms. Finally, we present a linear-time exact algorithms for
   trees.}},

Abstract = {{Domain wall motion is known as a major source of extrinsic contributions
   to the dielectric and piezoelectric properties of ferroelectric
   materials. In the present work, we report the extent of non-180 degrees
   domain wall motion during strong and weak electric field amplitudes in
   situ using time-resolved, high-energy X-ray diffraction in the
   ferroelectric morphotropic phase boundary composition
   0.55Bi(Ni1/2Ti1/2)O-3-0.45PbTiO(3) (BNT-45PT). After application of
   strong electric fields, two phases are shown to coexist. In the
   tetragonal phase of this material, the extent of 90 degrees domain wall
   motion is significant and the domain alignment is nearly saturated. Weak
   (subswitching) cyclic electric fields are then also shown to induce
   domain wall motion. Deaging, or the progressive loss of preferred domain
   orientation during sequentially increasing field amplitudes, is notably
   low in these materials, showing that the initial domain alignment is
   strongly stabilized. Overall, the in situ measurements reveal that
   domain wall motion significantly impacts the structure and properties of
   BNT-45PT and reinforces the importance of understanding domain wall
   motion contributions to the physical properties of ferroelectrics. (C)

   resolution of about 1 mu s. Locally luminous points and segments of
   channel both separate and below the main descending leader tip were
   recorded on the high-speed video. Bidirectional leaders were imaged
   initiating at the locally luminous points below the main channel tip,
   points that remain stationary during the interstep process. The average
   speed of five bidirectional leaders was 8.4x10(5) m/s upward and
   4.8x10(5) m/s downward, assuming 1.5 mu s between successive images. The
   main dart-stepped-leader channel tip moved downward between steps.
   Leader steps extended below the bottom of the previous bidirectional
   leader. Processes that can be seen between steps on high-speed video are
   generally below the noise threshold of the streak film, which shows
   primarily the newly formed steps.

Title = {{Phonon density of states and anharmonicity of UO2}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{MAR 28}},
Abstract = {{Phonon density of states (PDOS) measurements have been performed on
   polycrystalline UO2 at 295 and 1200 K using time-of-flight inelastic
   neutron scattering to investigate the impact of anharmonicity on the
   vibrational spectra and to benchmark ab initio PDOS simulations
   performed on this strongly correlated Mott insulator. Time-of-flight
   PDOS measurements include anharmonic linewidth broadening, inherently,
   and the factor of similar to 7 enhancement of the oxygen spectrum
   relative to the uranium component by the increased neutron sensitivity
   to the oxygen-dominated optical phonon modes. The first-principles
   simulations of quasiharmonic PDOS spectra were neutron weighted and
   anharmonicity was introduced in an approximate way by convolution with
   wave-vector-weighted averages over our previously measured phonon
   linewidths for UO2, which are provided in numerical form. Comparisons
   between the PDOS measurements and the simulations show reasonable
   agreement overall, but they also reveal important areas of disagreement
   for both high and low temperatures. The discrepancies stem largely from
   a similar to 10 meV compression in the overall bandwidth (energy range)
   of the oxygen-dominated optical phonons in the simulations. A similar
   linewidth-convoluted comparison performed with the PDOS spectrum of
   Dolling et al. obtained by shell-model fitting to their historical
   phonon dispersion measurements shows excellent agreement with the
   time-of-flight PDOS measurements reported here. In contrast, we show by
   comparisons of spectra in linewidth-convoluted form that recent
   first-principles simulations for UO2 fail to account for the PDOS
   spectrum determined from the measurements of Dolling et al. These
   results demonstrate PDOS measurements to be stringent tests for ab inito
   simulations of phonon physics in UO2 and they indicate further the need
   for advances in theory to address the lattice dynamics of UO2.}},

Abstract = {{We studied simultaneous electric field changes, microsecond-scale
   (VLF/LF) magnetic field pulses, and VHF emissions associated with K
   processes in 37 cloud and 54 cloud-to-ground lightning flashes that
   occurred in a local convective thunderstorm in Shanghai. All the
   observed features were very similar for both types of flashes. Over 98\%
   of the 1252 observed K changes were associated with detectable
   microsecond-scale pulses, although only about 26\% of them were
   accompanied by large pulses whose amplitude exceeds by at least 50\% the
   average amplitude of the five largest pulses in the flash. VHF bursts,
   which almost always coincide in time with microsecond-scale pulses, can
   occur either during K changes or during the gaps between K changes.
   About 9\% of K changes were observed to be associated with regular pulse
   trains, with pulses in the train showing one-to-one correspondence to
   VHF bursts and occurring at a geometric mean interval of 6.9 mu s.
   Overall, our results indicate that small microsecond-scale pulses are an
   inherent feature of K processes. We infer that the K process can be
   viewed as a fast negative leader, but only those leaders with
   appreciable charge transfer show step/ramp-like K changes in electric
   field records.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental investigation on the role of surface structure in pool
   boiling critical heat flux (CHF) enhancement on randomly roughened and
   structured surfaces is considered. In the first set of experiments, CHF
   was measured on a horizontal circular brass surface with root mean
   square (RMS) surface roughness varying from 0.15 to 5m using pentane,
   hexane, and FC-72 as working fluids at system pressures varying from 150
   to 450 kPa. CHF is observed to increase with increasing surface
   roughness, although the enhancement diminishes with increasing pressure.
   A maximum enhancement factor of 1.15 is observed for the surface with 5m
   RMS roughness. CHF enhancement was measured for a second set of
   experiments with FC-72 and hexane on new reentrant interconnected
   microstructured hoodoo surfaces, and hoodoo sizes range from 10 to 80m.
   The measured CHF enhancement factor on the hoodoo surfaces varies from
   1.05 to 1.67. The enhancement generally increases with decreasing hoodoo
   size, and the maximum enhancement factor (1.67) is for hexane with 10-m
   hoodoos. The maximum enhancement factor for FC-72 is 1.48, also with
   10-m hoodoos. It has been demonstrated that the surfaces which show good
   CHF enhancement exhibit excellent wicking properties. A recent lift-off
   CHF model for pool boiling is modified to account for the wicking action
   observed for structured surfaces. Using the measured wicking rate for
   various surface/fluid combinations, the lift-off model gives reasonably
   good prediction of the measured CHF enhancement.}},

Abstract = {{The potential ecological and human health risk related with urban street
   dust from urban areas of Tianjin, China was quantitatively analyzed
   using the method of toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP)
   and simple bioaccessibility extraction test (SBET). In the study,
   Hakason index, Nemerow index (P), the hazard index (HI) and the cancer
   risk index (RI) were calculated to assess the potential risk. The
   sequence of potential ecological risk based on Hakason index was arsenic
   (As) > cadmium (Cd) > lead (Pb) > copper (Cu) > chromium (Cr), in
   particular, As and Cd were regarded as high polluted metals. While the
   results of extraction of TCLP were assessed using P, the sequence was As
   > Pb > Cd > Cr > Cu, which mean that As and Pb should be low polluted,
   and Cd, Cr and Cu would barely not polluted. For human health, total
   carcinogenic risk for children and adults was 2.01x10(-3) and
   1.05x10(-3), respectively. This could be considered to be intolerable in
   urban street dust exposure. The sequence in the hazard quotient (HQ) of
   each element was As > Cr > Pb > Cu > Cd. The HI value of these toxic
   metals in urban street dust for children and adults was 5.88x10(-1) and
   2.80x10(-1), respectively. According to the characters of chemistry,
   mobility, and bioavailability of metals in urban street dust, we
   estimated the hazards on the environment and human health, which will
   help us to get more reasonable information for risk management of metals

Abstract = {{Recent work has demonstrated increased levels of redox-active iron
   biominerals in Alzheimer's disease (AD) tissue. However, the origin,
   nature, and role of iron in AD pathology remains unclear. Using X-ray
   absorption, X-ray microspectroscopy, and electron microscopy techniques,
   we examined interactions between the AD peptide beta-amyloid (A beta)
   and ferrihydrite, which is the ferric form taken when iron is stored in
   humans. We report that A beta is capable of reducing ferrihydrite to a
   pure iron(II) mineral where antiferromagnetically ordered Fe2+ cations
   occupy two nonequivalent crystal symmetry sites. Examination of these
   iron(II) phases following air exposure revealed a material consistent
   with the iron(II)-rich mineral magnetite. These results demonstrate the
   capability of A beta to induce the redox-active biominerals reported in
   AD tissue from natural iron precursors. Such interactions between A beta
   and fenihydrite shed light upon the processes of AD pathogenesis, while
   providing potential targets for future therapies.}},

Abstract = {{An oil spill model is developed and coupled to a current-wave model to
   simulate oil spill transport in aquatic environments where waves are
   present. The oil spill model incorporates physical-chemical processes of
   oil spill, and simulates oil slick transport by a circulation-driven
   Lagrangian Parcel model. Using the coupled oil spill model and the
   current-wave model CH3D-SWAN, a laboratory observed wave induced
   circulation and oil slick evolution are successfully simulated, while
   different current-wave coupling schemes generate different flow patterns
   and oil slick evolution. The modeling system is also shown to simulate
   Langmuir circulation and resulting oil slicks. Hypothetical scenarios of
   oil spill near Virginia coast during Hurricane Isabel and Irene are
   simulated using the oil spill model and the CH3D-Storm Surge Modeling
   System to assess the role of storm waves during oil spill. The spill
   area is significantly larger when storm waves are considered, implying
   waves significantly increase oil spill dispersion. (c) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This work explored the effect of temperature, production method, and
   feedstock type on the physicochemical and biological properties of
   biochars and hydrochars. Biochars and hydrochars made at lower
   temperatures had higher production rates. Higher pyrolysis temperatures
   not only increased carbon content of biochars but also produced higher
   thermal stability biochars that did not start to decompose in air after
   400-450 degrees C. The production method showed strong effect on biochar
   properties. Compared to the dry-pyrolysis biochars derived from the same
   feedstocks, the hydrochars had more acidic pH values and lower carbon
   contents. The results showed that feedstock types could also influence
   characteristics of the biochars. None of the chars showed statistically
   significant effects on plant seed germination and seedling growth and
   thus could be used as soil amendments. Our findings indicated that
   biochars with different properties could be developed by changing
   production conditions to better satisfy their environmental
   applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   deformed UFG alloys revealed temperature dependent evolution of

   increased and activation volume decreased, which may be related to the
   interactions of dislocations with grain boundaries. The SRS of UFG

Title = {{MRI-Based Computational Model of Heterogeneous Tracer Transport
   following Local Infusion into a Mouse Hind Limb Tumor}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{MAR 11}},
Abstract = {{Systemic drug delivery to solid tumors involving macromolecular
   therapeutic agents is challenging for many reasons. Amongst them is
   their chaotic microvasculature which often leads to inadequate and
   uneven uptake of the drug. Localized drug delivery can circumvent such
   obstacles and convection-enhanced delivery (CED) - controlled infusion
   of the drug directly into the tissue - has emerged as a promising
   delivery method for distributing macromolecules over larger tissue
   volumes. In this study, a three-dimensional MR image-based computational
   porous media transport model accounting for realistic anatomical
   geometry and tumor leakiness was developed for predicting the
   interstitial flow field and distribution of albumin tracer following CED
   into the hind-limb tumor (KHT sarcoma) in a mouse. Sensitivity of the
   model to changes in infusion flow rate, catheter placement and tissue
   hydraulic conductivity were investigated. The model predictions suggest
   that 1) tracer distribution is asymmetric due to heterogeneous porosity;
   2) tracer distribution volume varies linearly with infusion volume
   within the whole leg, and exponentially within the tumor reaching a
   maximum steady-state value; 3) infusion at the center of the tumor with
   high flow rates leads to maximum tracer coverage in the tumor with
   minimal leakage outside; and 4) increasing the tissue hydraulic
   conductivity lowers the tumor interstitial fluid pressure and decreases
   the tracer distribution volume within the whole leg and tumor. The model
   thus predicts that the interstitial fluid flow and drug transport is
   sensitive to porosity and changes in extracellular space. This
   image-based model thus serves as a potential tool for exploring the
   effects of transport heterogeneity in tumors.}},

Abstract = {{Frequency-dependent quantum capacitance C-Q of monolayer transition
   metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is computed and compared to that of
   graphene. It is found that the frequency dependence of C-Q in TMDs
   differs drastically from that of graphene which has a divergent point.
   The plasma resonance forms when the quantum capacitance is negative and
   has the same magnitude as the electrostatic capacitance. The calculation
   shows that the plasma in TMDs depends on the band-structure-limited
   velocity, band gap, and doping density, which can be controlled via gate
   biases. The plasma frequencies of TMDs are in the rage of terahertz
   useful for various applications. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{This mini-review provides a brief overview of recent advances in the
   area of biologically-relevant nanomaterials composed of
   poly(N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide) (PHPMA). Polymer diversity
   within the field of nanomedicine has grown considerably in recent years,
   yet the overwhelming majority of soft nanomaterials intended for medical
   applications are composed of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and its
   derivatives. However, it is well known that PHPMA offers several
   advantages over PEG in some applications, including its ability to be
   functionalized via its side-chain hydroxyl group to incorporate drugs,
   imaging agents, targeting ligands, etc. This mini-review focuses on
   select recent advances in PHPMA-based nanostructures. Particular
   attention is placed on polymer drug conjugates, self-assembled
   nanoparticles, and other recent examples of PHPMA-based
   nanotherapeutics.}},

Abstract = {{Here we present the results from an intercomparison of multiple global
   gridded crop models (GGCMs) within the framework of the Agricultural
   Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project and the Inter-Sectoral
   Impacts Model Intercomparison Project. Results indicate strong negative
   effects of climate change, especially at higher levels of warming and at
   low latitudes; models that include explicit nitrogen stress project more
   severe impacts. Across seven GGCMs, five global climate models, and four
   representative concentration pathways, model agreement on direction of
   yield changes is found in many major agricultural regions at both low
   and high latitudes; however, reducing uncertainty in sign of response in
   mid-latitude regions remains a challenge. Uncertainties related to the
   representation of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and high temperature effects
   demonstrated here show that further research is urgently needed to
   better understand effects of climate change on agricultural production
   and to devise targeted adaptation strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research and policy directives have emerged with a focus on
   sustainable management of waste materials, and the mining of old
   landfills represents an opportunity to meet sustainability goals by
   reducing the release of liquid- and gas-phase contaminants into the
   environment, recovering land for more productive use, and recovering
   energy from the landfilled materials. The emissions associated with the
   landfill mining process (waste excavation, screening, and on-site
   transportation) were inventoried on the basis of diesel fuel consumption
   data from two hill-scale mining projects (1.3-1.5 L/in-place m(3) of
   landfill space mined) and unit emissions (mass per liter of diesel
   consumption) from heavy equipment typically deployed for mining
   landfills. An analytical framework was developed and used in an
   assessment of the life-cycle environmental impacts of a few end-use
   management options for materials deposited and mined from an unlined
   landfill. The results showed that substantial greenhouse gas emission
   reductions can be realized in both the waste relocation and materials
   and energy recovery scenarios compared to a ``do nothing{''} case. The
   recovery of metal components from landfilled waste was found to have the
   greatest benefit across nearly all impact categories evaluated, while
   emissions associated with heavy equipment to mine the waste itself were
   found to be negligible compared to the benefits that mining provided.}},

Abstract = {{Daily images collected with the MODIS sensor on the NASA Aqua satellite
   were used to describe chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations before,
   during, and after synoptic-scale meteorological pulses in the Yucatan
   Basin, Caribbean Sea. The relative influence of vertical diffusive and
   vertical advective transport on mixing of the near surface layer was
   quantified with wind data from the QuikSCAT satellite. Computation of
   vertical density eddy diffusivity and gradient Richardson numbers was
   done with data from the three-dimensional MERCATOR model. The model
   evidenced the importance of vertical shear (i.e., vertical diffusive
   processes) in generating mixing during autumn and winter (2007-2009).
   During moderate meteorological pulses (e.g., cold fronts, easterly
   tropical waves, and low-pressure systems with wind speeds of 9-15 m
   s(-1) sustained over 2 days), mixing caused by diffusive transport (eddy
   viscosity of 10 x 10(-3) m(2) s(-1)) was at least one order of magnitude
   higher than upward advective mixing (0.3 x 10(-3) m(2) s(-1)). During
   the passage of hurricanes Ivan (September 2004) and Wilma (October
   2005), upward advective mixing (5-7 m(2) s(-1)) dominated mixing of the
   upper water column and was nearly four orders of magnitude higher than
   during moderate meteorological events. Background chl-a concentrations
   of 0.03-0.08 mg m(-3) were observed during the July October period.
   During synoptic weather pulses, three different patterns in the chl-a
   concentrations were observed: first, chl-a concentrations in the range
   of 0.05 to 0.12 mg m(-3) followed moderate meteorological pulses;
   second, higher regional chl-a concentrations (0.5-2.0 mg m(-3)) followed
   the passage of hurricanes; and third, the formation of filaments showing
   apparent high chl-a (0.3-1.5 mg m(-3)) south of Cuba, possibly caused by
   freshwater discharge from land. The changes in chlorophyll patterns
   following meteorological events illustrate typical patterns of
   connectivity among different parts of the Yucatan Basin.}},

Abstract = {{Most studies using multivariate techniques for pollution source
   evaluation are conducted in free-flowing rivers with distinct point and
   nonpoint sources. This study expanded on previous research to a managed
   ``canal{''} system discharging into the Indian River Lagoon, Florida,
   where water and land management is the single most important
   anthropogenic factor influencing water quality. Hydrometric and land use
   data of four drainage basins were uniquely integrated into the analysis
   of 25 yr of monthly water quality data collected at seven stations to
   determine the impact of water and land management on the spatial
   variability of water quality. Cluster analysis (CA) classified seven
   monitoring stations into four groups (CA groups). All water quality
   parameters identified by discriminant analysis showed distinct spatial
   patterns among the four CA groups. Two-step principal component
   analysis/factor analysis (PCA/FA) was conducted with (i) water quality
   data alone and (ii) water quality data in conjunction with rainfall,
   flow, and land use data. The results indicated that PCA/FA of water
   quality data alone was unable to identify factors associated with
   management activities. The addition of hydrometric and land use data
   into PCA/FA revealed close associations of nutrients and color with land
   management and storm-water retention in pasture and citrus lands; total
   suspended solids, turbidity, and NO3 + NO2 with flow and Lake Okeechobee
   releases; specific conductivity with supplemental irrigation supply; and
   dissolved O-2 with wetland preservation. The practical implication
   emphasizes the importance of basin-specific land and water management
   for ongoing pollutant loading reduction and ecosystem restoration
   programs.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a pricing model for convertible bonds based on the
   utility-indiffierence method and get access to the empirical results by
   use of Information Technology. By using the stochastic control theory,
   the general expression of utility indiffierence price on convertible
   bonds is obtained under the CIR interest rate model. Furthermore, using
   the proposed theoretical model, we present an empirical pricing study of
   China's market, using three convertible bonds and more than 70 months of
   daily market prices. The parameters value is estimated by the maximum
   likelihood method, and the prices of convertible bonds are simulated by
   the Monte Carlo approach. The empirical results indicate that the
   theoretical prices are higher than the actual market prices 0.24-4.58\%,
   and the utility indiffierence prices are better than the Black-Scholes
   (BS) prices.}},

Title = {{Change in intraindividual variability over time as a key metric for
   defining performance-based cognitive fatigability}},
Journal = {{BRAIN AND COGNITION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{251-258}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Cognitive fatigability is conventionally quantified as the increase over
   time in either mean reaction time (RT) or error rate from two or more
   time periods during sustained performance of a prolonged cognitive task.
   There is evidence indicating that these mean performance measures may
   not sufficiently reflect the response characteristics of cognitive
   fatigue. We hypothesized that changes in intraindividual variability
   over time would be a more sensitive and ecologically meaningful metric
   for investigations of fatigability of cognitive performance. To test the
   hypothesis fifteen young adults were recruited. Trait fatigue
   perceptions in various domains were assessed with the Multidimensional
   Fatigue Index (MFI). Behavioral data were then recorded during
   performance of a three-hour continuous cued Stroop task. Results showed
   that intraindividual variability, as quantified by the coefficient of
   variation of RT, increased linearly over the course of three hours and
   demonstrated a significantly greater effect size than mean RT or
   accuracy. Change in intraindividual RT variability over time was
   significantly correlated with relevant subscores of the MFI including
   reduced activity, reduced motivation and mental fatigue. While change in
   mean RT over time was also correlated with reduced motivation and mental
   fatigue, these correlations were significantly smaller than those
   associated with intraindividual RT variability. RT distribution analysis
   using an ex-Gaussian model further revealed that change in
   intraindividual variability over time reflects an increase in the
   exponential component of variance and may reflect attentional lapses or
   other breakdowns in cognitive control. These results suggest that
   intraindividual variability and its change over time provide important
   metrics for measuring cognitive fatigability and may prove useful for
   inferring the underlying neuronal mechanisms of both perceptions of
   fatigue and objective changes in performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{This paper considers a very general class of customer-to-resource
   assignment problems relevant to a variety of manufacturing contexts.
   This problem class addresses settings in which subsets of customer types
   share resource capacities as well as a fixed amount of capacity
   consumption, independent of production volume. More broadly, our model
   addresses cross-facility production limits and shared capacity
   consumption within each customer type. To solve these large-scale
   optimization problems, we apply a branch-and-price solution approach.
   This approach relies on an effective solution method for a novel class
   of nonlinear knapsack pricing problems. As our computational results
   demonstrate, despite the fact that the resulting master problem is not a
   simple set-partitioning problem, the problem's relaxation is
   sufficiently tight to produce an algorithm that significantly
   outperforms CPLEX for a wide range of problem parameter settings.}},

Abstract = {{A diverse spectrum of technology drivers such as improved thermal
   barriers, higher efficiency thermoelectric energy conversion,
   phase-change memory, heat-assisted magnetic recording, thermal
   management of nanoscale electronics, and nanoparticles for thermal
   medical therapies are motivating studies of the applied physics of
   thermal transport at the nanoscale. This review emphasizes developments
   in experiment, theory, and computation in the past ten years and
   summarizes the present status of the field. Interfaces become
   increasingly important on small length scales. Research during the past
   decade has extended studies of interfaces between simple metals and
   inorganic crystals to interfaces with molecular materials and liquids
   with systematic control of interface chemistry and physics. At
   separations on the order of similar to 1 nm, the science of radiative
   transport through nanoscale gaps overlaps with thermal conduction by the
   coupling of electronic and vibrational excitations across weakly bonded
   or rough interfaces between materials. Major advances in the physics of
   phonons include first principles calculation of the phonon lifetimes of
   simple crystals and application of the predicted scattering rates in
   parameter-free calculations of the thermal conductivity. Progress in the
   control of thermal transport at the nanoscale is critical to continued
   advances in the density of information that can be stored in phase
   change memory devices and new generations of magnetic storage that will
   use highly localized heat sources to reduce the coercivity of magnetic
   media. Ultralow thermal conductivity-thermal conductivity below the
   conventionally predicted minimum thermal conductivity-has been observed
   in nanolaminates and disordered crystals with strong anisotropy.
   Advances in metrology by time-domain thermoreflectance have made
   measurements of the thermal conductivity of a thin layer with
   micron-scale spatial resolution relatively routine. Scanning thermal
   microscopy and thermal analysis using proximal probes has achieved
   spatial resolution of 10 nm, temperature precision of 50 mK, sensitivity
   to heat flows of 10 pW, and the capability for thermal analysis of
   sub-femtogram samples. (C) 2014 Author(s). All article content, except

Abstract = {{The main contribution of this paper is in the development of
   vision-based estimation and control system for robotic fruit harvesting
   and rigorous stability analysis to guarantee performance of the
   closed-loop system. The presented cooperative visual servo controller
   benefits from the large field-of-view of a fixed camera and the accuracy
   of a camera-in-hand (CiH). Computationally inexpensive perspective
   transformation-based range estimation method obtains 3D fruit position
   using a monocular camera to enable real-time manipulator control. A
   rotation controller is developed to orient the robot such that the
   target fruit selected by the fixed camera can be viewed by the CiH
   attached to the end-effector. Subsequently, the end-effector can be
   servoed to the target fruit location using the presented pursuit
   guidance based hybrid translation controller. Lyapunov-based stability
   analysis guarantees global exponential regulation of the end-effector.
   Numerical simulations verify the feasibility of the developed controller
   while the performance is evaluated on a seven degrees-of-freedom
   kinematically redundant manipulator using an artificial citrus tree. The
   position of the fruit was randomly selected, and the closed-loop visual
   servo control experiment was performed 21 times to analyze the
   repeatability and accuracy of the developed controller. With 95\%
   confidence level the expected position of the robot end-effector is
   observed to lie within the confidence ellipsoid. The accuracy of the
   controller was observed to be about 15 mm, thus making the system
   suitable for harvesting medium and large varieties of citrus fruit but
   may limit operation for small varieties such as page and blood oranges.

Abstract = {{A slow molecular diffusion rate often limits the desorption process of
   an absorbate molecule from a liquid absorbent. To enhance the desorption
   rate, the absorbent is often boiled to increase the liquid vapor
   interfacial area. However, the growth of bubbles generated during the
   nucleate boiling process still remains mass-diffusion limited. Here, it
   is shown that a desorption rate higher than that of boiling can be
   achieved, if the vapor absorbent interface is continuously replenished
   with the absorbate-rich solution to limit the concentration boundary
   layer growth. The study is conducted in a LiBr-water-solution, in which
   the water molecules' diffusion rate is quite slow. The manipulation of
   the vapor solution interface concentration distribution is enabled by
   the mechanical confinement of the solution flow within microchannels,
   using a hydrophobic vapor-venting membrane and the implementation of
   microstructures on the flow channel's bottom wall. The microstructures
   stretch and fold the laminar streamlines within the solution film and
   produce vortices. The vortices continuously replace the concentrated
   solution at the vapor solution interface with the water-rich solution
   brought from the bottom and middle of the flow channel. The physics of
   the process is described using a combination of experimental and
   numerical studies. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Proton irradiation from the backside of the samples were employed to
   enhance off-state drain breakdown voltage of AlGaN/GaN high electron
   mobility transistors (HEMTs) grown on Si substrates. Via holes were
   fabricated directly under the active area of the HEMTs by etching
   through the Si substrate for subsequent backside proton irradiation. By
   taking the advantage of the steep drop at the end of proton energy loss
   profile, the defects created by the proton irradiation from the backside
   of the sample could be precisely placed at specific locations inside the
   AlGaN/GaN HEMT structure. There were no degradation of drain current nor
   enhancement of off-state drain voltage breakdown voltage observed for
   the irradiated AlGaN/GaN HEMTs with the proton energy of 225 or 275 keV,
   for which the defects created by the proton irradiations were
   intentionally placed in the GaN buffer. HEMTs with defects placed in the
   two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel region and AlGaN barrier
   using 330 or 340 keV protons not only showed degradation of both drain
   current and extrinsic transconductance but also exhibited improvement of
   the off-state drain breakdown voltage. The Florida Object Oriented
   Device and Process Simulator Technology Computer Aided Design
   finite-element simulations were performed to confirm the hypothesis of a
   virtual gate formed around the 2DEG region to reduce the peak electric
   field around the gate edges and increase the off-state drain breakdown
   voltage. (C) 2014 American Vacuum Society.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of proton irradiation dose on the dc characteristics of
   AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) with source field
   plates were studied. The HEMTs were irradiated with various protons
   doses ranging from 5 x 10(12) to 5 x 10(15) cm(-2) at a fixed energy of
   5 MeV. HEMTs irradiated with proton dose below 5 x 10(13) cm(-2) showed
   less than 2\% degradation of either saturation drain current (I-DSS) or
   transconductance (g(m)). Significant changes of these parameters were
   observed for the devices irradiated with doses above 5 x 10(13) cm(-2).
   HEMTs irradiated with the highest proton dose of 5 x 10(15) cm(-2)
   showed a reduction of I-DSS and g(m) of 86\% and 64.7\%, and a positive
   V-th shift of 0.84 V, respectively. Despite the significant I-DSS and
   g(m) reductions, the off-state drain breakdown voltage (V-BR) was
   improved more than five times at this particular irradiation condition.
   The significant improvement of off-state drain breakdown voltage was
   attributed to the formation of a virtual gate at drain side of gate

Title = {{When Spectrum Meets Clouds: Optimal Session Based Spectrum Trading under

Volume = {{32}},

Abstract = {{Spectrum trading creates more accessing opportunities for secondary
   users (SUs) and economically benefits the primary users (PUs). However,
   it is challenging to implement spectrum trading in multi-hop cognitive
   radio networks (CRNs) due to harsh cognitive radio (CR) requirements on
   SUs' devices, uncertain spectrum supply from PUs and complex competition
   relationship among different CR sessions. Unlike the per-user based
   spectrum trading designs in previous studies, in this paper, we propose
   a novel session based spectrum trading system, spectrum clouds, in
   multi-hop CRNs. In spectrum clouds, we introduce a new service provider,
   secondary service provider (SSP), to facilitate the accessing of SUs
   without CR capability and harvest uncertain spectrum supply. The SSP
   also conducts spectrum trading among CR sessions w.r.t. their conflicts
   and competitions. Leveraging a 3-dimensional (3-D) conflict graph, we
   mathematically describe the conflicts and competitions among the
   candidate sessions for spectrum trading. Given the rate requirements and
   bidding values of candidate trading sessions, we formulate the optimal
   spectrum trading into the SSP's revenue maximization problem under
   multiple cross-layer constraints. In view of the NP-hardness of the
   problem, we develop heuristic algorithms to pursue feasible solutions.
   Through extensive simulations, we show that the solutions found by the
   proposed algorithms are close to the optimal one.}},

Abstract = {{Machine-to-machine (M2M) communications have emerged as a new
   communication paradigm to support Internet of Things (IoT) applications.
   Millions to trillions of machines will connect to mobile communication
   networks (MCNs) to provide IoT applications. This group-based behavior
   is considered one of the features of M2M communications. That is,
   machines are likely with correlated mobility and may perform mobility
   management at the same time. As a result of this scenario, signaling
   exchanges for machines are more likely to occur at the same time, and
   the random access channel (RACH) for the signaling is more likely to be
   congested. In this paper, we propose a group mobility management (GMM)
   mechanism where machines are grouped based on the similarity of their
   mobility patterns at the location database (LDB), and only the leader
   machine performs mobility management on behalf of the other machines in
   the same group. The GMM mechanism attempts to mitigate the signaling
   congestion problem. Through our performance study, we show how the GMM
   mechanism can reduce registration signaling from machines.}},

Title = {{Reactivity of Iron/Zirconia Powder in Fluidized Bed Thermochemical
   Hydrogen Production Reactors}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESOURCES TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{A fluidized bed reactor has been developed which uses a two-step
   thermochemical water splitting process with a peak hydrogen production
   rate of 47 Ncm(3)/min.g(Fe) at an oxidation temperature of 850 degrees
   C. Of particular interest, is that a mixture of iron and zirconia powder
   is fluidized during the oxidation reaction using a steam mass flux of 58
   g/min cm(2). The zirconia powder serves to virtually eliminate iron
   powder sintering while maintaining a high reaction rate. The
   iron/zirconia powder is mixed in a ratio of 1:2 by apparent volume and
   has a mass ratio of 1:1. Both iron and zirconia particles are sieved to
   sizes ranging from 125 mu m to 355 mu m. The efficacy of zirconia as a
   sintering inhibitor was found to be dependent on the iron and zirconia
   mean particle size, particle size distribution and iron/zirconia
   apparent volume ratio. At 650 degrees C, the oxidation of iron powder
   with a mean particle size of 100 mu m and a wide particle size
   distribution (40-250 mu m) mixed with 44 mu m zirconia powder with an
   iron/zirconia apparent volume ratio of 1: 1 results in 75-90\%
   sintering. In all cases, when iron is mixed with zirconia, the hydrogen
   production rate is not affected when compared with the pure iron case
   assuming an equivalent mass of iron is in the mixture. When iron powder
   is mixed with zirconia, both with a narrow particle size distribution
   (125-355 mu m), the first oxidation step results in 3-7\% sintering when
   the reactions are carried out at temperatures ranging between 840 and
   895 degrees C. The hydrogen fractional yield is high (94-97\%). For
   subsequent redox reactions, the macroscopic sintering is totally
   eliminated at 867 and 895 degrees C, although the hydrogen fractional
   yield decreases to 27 and 33\%, respectively. It is demonstrated that

Abstract = {{In this paper, it is shown that yielding and void evolution in a porous
   metallic material is strongly influenced by the particularities of the
   plastic flow of the matrix. This is demonstrated by comparing the
   effective response of porous solids for which the matrix is described by
   Tresca and von Mises yield criterion, respectively. The effective
   response of the porous solid is calculated analytically using rigorous
   limit analysis theorems and upscaling techniques. Analysis is conducted
   for both tensile and compressive axisymmetric loading scenarios and
   spherical void geometry. For the first time it is demonstrated that if
   the matrix plastic response is governed by Tresca yield criterion, the
   overall response is softer, the combined effects of pressure and the
   third-invariant on yielding being much stronger than in a porous solid
   with von Mises matrix. Furthermore, the rate of void growth or collapse
   is much faster in a porous solid with Tresca matrix. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{85-98}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Assessments of biotic nutrient limitation in aquatic ecosystems
   typically rely on concentrations and ratios of potentially limiting
   nutrients. While successful in lakes, this approach has been less
   effective in streams, which often are dominated by benthic autotrophs
   (e.g., algae and vascular plants). We compared water-column nutrient
   concentration (C) to 3 alternative metrics and assessed their ability to
   predict autotrophic nutrient limitation in streams. One metric, nutrient
   flux (F) is the product of nutrient concentration and stream discharge.
   The other 2 metrics, autotrophic uptake length (Sw,alpha) and
   autotrophic uptake velocity (Vf,alpha), are derived from
   nutrient-spiraling theory and incorporate nutrient uptake. To evaluate
   the ability of each metric to predict nutrient limitation, we analyzed
   nutrient diffusing substrata (NDS) data from the Lotic Intersite
   Nitrogen eXperiment (LINX) (phases I and II; n = 80 streams across North
   America). We calculated NDS response ratios (RRs) to quantify the
   strength of autotrophic nutrient limitation in each stream, and we
   regressed RRs against each of the 4 metrics for N and P. For the LINX I
   analysis, S-w,S- alpha was the best predictor of autotrophic N
   limitation. F and V-f,V-a also performed well, and C was a poor
   predictor. In contrast, all 4 metrics were poor predictors of N
   limitation for the LINX II analysis when evaluated for individual
   streams, by land use, and within regions. None of the metrics were able
   to predict P limitation for either LINX study. Accuracy could be
   enhanced by developing new methods to quantify autotrophic nutrient
   uptake and limitation in stream reaches, but consistency with
   nutrient-spiraling theory and improved predictability of autotrophic N
   limitation make S-w,S-alpha a potentially useful metric for evaluating N
   limitation in streams.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: To examine the potential of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in
   transfecting human osteosarcoma fibroblasts (MG-63) and investigate the
   effects of a novel non-viral oscillating nanomagnetic gene transfection
   system (magnefect-nano (TM)) in enhancing transfection efficiency (TE).
   Methods: MG-63 cells were transfected using MNPs coupled with a
   GFP-carrying plasmid. The magnefect-nano system was evaluated for
   transfection efficiency and potential associated effects on cell
   viability. Results: MG-63 cells were efficiently transfected using MNPs
   and the magnefect-nano system significantly enhanced overall
   transfection efficiency. MNPs were not found to affect cell viability
   and/or function of the cells. Conclusion: Non-viral transfection using
   MNPs and the magnefect-nano system can be used to transfect MG-63 cells
   and assist reporter gene delivery on a single cell basis, highlighting
   the wide potential of nanomagnetic gene transfection in gene therapy.

Abstract = {{Recently, Cazacu et al (2013a J. Appl. Mech. 80 64501) demonstrated that
   the plastic potential of porous solids with a von Mises matrix
   containing randomly distributed spherical cavities should involve a very
   specific coupling between the mean stress and J(3)(Sigma), the third
   invariant of the stress deviator. In this paper, the effects of this
   coupling on void evolution are investigated. It is shown that the new
   analytical model predicts that for axisymmetric stress states, void
   growth is faster for loading histories corresponding to J(3)(Sigma) >= 0
   than for those corresponding to J(3)(Sigma) <= 0. However, void collapse
   occurs faster for loadings where J(3)(Sigma) <= 0 than for those
   characterized by J(3)(Sigma) >= 0. Finite-element (FE) results also
   confirm these trends. Furthermore, comparisons between FE results and
   corresponding predictions of yielding and void evolution show the
   improvements provided by the new model with respect to Gurson's.
   Irrespective of the loading history, the predicted rate of void growth
   is much faster than that according to Gurson's criterion.}},

Abstract = {{The dusty environment of the moon and the deposition of charged
   particles were troublesome in previous NASA explorations. In this study,
   an electrostatic lunar dust repeller (ELDR) was developed to mitigate
   the dust deposition problem. The ELDR consists of an arrangement of
   thin, needle-shaped electrodes in front of the protected surface to
   repel approaching, like-charged lunar dust. A discrete element method
   (OEM) was applied to track particle trajectories for determining the
   removal efficiency. Simulation results for single electrodes (L=5 cm,
   D=1 mm and L=10 cm, D=1 mm) both protecting a 5-cm x 5-cm surface
   indicated that 4 kV and 1.5 kV were the respective-applied voltages
   required to achieve 100\% protection from falling 20-mu m lunar dust
   particles. The electrical particleparticle interaction was identified to
   be a beneficial factor. Finite element analysis concluded that an
   x-shaped pattern was the most effective arrangement of the ensemble
   electrodes to protect a 30-cm x 30-cm surface. Modeling results showed
   that 2.2 kV and 1.4 kV were the minimum voltages applied to electrodes
   of length L=5 and 10 cm, respectively, on each electrode of the ensemble
   model to achieve complete removal of 20-gm-sized particles. The
   ensemble-electrode ELDR required lower applied voltage than the
   single-electrode ELDR, and in the most conservative scenario, it
   consumed only 9 times more electric power to protect an area 36 times
   larger. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid growth of online social networks (OSNs) has brought a
   revolutionary change in the way geographically dispersed people interact
   and cooperate with each other toward achieving some common goals.
   Recently, new ways of ad-hoc cooperation have been demonstrated during
   the hurricane Irene and the earthquake in Japan. In such emergency
   situations, OSNs have already taken a significant role as alternative
   social media that support altruistic information sharing and cooperation
   among people. However, existing cooperation approaches have not been
   well-organized and are highly vulnerable to security threats such as a
   disclosure of users' identities and the leakage of other private data
   because of the lack of secure cooperation mechanisms. To support secure
   and effective cooperation in OSNs, in this paper, we propose the CPBAC
   (Community-centric Property Based Access Control) model, which extends
   the existing CRiBAC (Community-centric Role interaction Based Access
   Control) model for use in OSNs to support cooperation among users. To
   verify the feasibility of the proposed model, we have implemented a
   prototype application on Facebook and have demonstrated its
   applicability with two working examples. (C)2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MECHANICS A-SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{82-90}},
Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{The generally accepted view is that induced plastic anisotropy is the
   main reason for accumulation of axial strains during monotonic and
   cyclic free-end torsion. In this paper, analytical results and numerical
   simulations using an elastic/plastic model with yielding described by
   the isotropic form of Cazacu et al. (2006) criterion and isotropic
   hardening point to another important cause of this phenomenon. It is
   shown that such phenomenon can occur in an isotropic material, a slight
   difference between the uniaxial yield stresses in tension and
   compression of the material leading to a build-up of inelastic axial
   strains during cyclic torsion at constant strain amplitude. It is
   demonstrated that the ratio between the uniaxial yield stresses in
   tension and compression dictates whether permanent shortening or
   lengthening of the specimen occurs. Furthermore, it is predicted that by
   axially preloading the material below its plastic threshold and then
   subject it to strain controlled cyclic torsion under constant axial
   load, the axial effects may be either reinforced or reduced. Thus, for
   any given isotropic material it is possible to estimate the value of the
   constant load and the strain amplitude that need to be prescribed in
   order to eliminate these effects. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to show how insight obtained from a
   mean-field model can be used to create an architecture for approximate
   dynamic programming (ADP) for a certain class of games comprising of a
   large number of agents. The general technique is illustrated with the
   aid of a mean-field oscillator game model introduced in our prior work.
   The states of the model are interpreted as the phase angles for a
   collection of nonhomogeneous oscillators, and in this way the model may
   be regarded as an extension of the classical coupled oscillator model of
   Kuramoto. The paper introduces ADP techniques for design and adaptation
   (learning) of approximately optimal control laws for this model. For
   this purpose, a parameterization is proposed, based on an analysis of
   the mean-field PDE model for the game. In an offline setting, a Galerkin
   procedure is introduced to choose the optimal parameters while in an
   online setting, a steepest descent algorithm is proposed. The paper
   provides a detailed analysis of the optimal parameter values as well as
   the Bellman error with both the Galerkin approximation and the online
   algorithm. Finally, a phase transition result is described for the large
   population limit when each oscillator uses the approximately optimal
   control law. A critical value of the control penalty parameter is
   identified: above this value, the oscillators are incoherent; and below
   this value (when control is sufficiently cheap) the oscillators
   synchronize. These conclusions are illustrated with results from
   numerical experiments.}},

Abstract = {{For many industrial, medical and space technologies, cryogenic fluids
   play irreplaceable roles. When any cryogenic system is initially
   started, it must go through a transient chill down period prior to
   normal operation. Chilldown is the process of introducing the cryogenic
   liquid into the system, and allowing the system components to cool down
   to several hundred degrees below the ambient temperature. The chilldown
   process is an important initial stage before a system begins
   functioning. The objective of this paper is to investigate the chilldown
   process associated with a flexible hose that was simulated by a channel
   with saw-teeth inner wall surface structure in the current study. We
   have investigated the fundamental physics of the two-phase flow and
   quenching heat transfer during cryogenic chilldown inside the simulated
   flexible hose through flow visualization, data measurement and analysis.
   The flow pattern developed inside the channel was recorded by a high
   speed camera for flow pattern investigation. The experimental results
   indicate that the chilldown process that is composed of unsteady
   vapor-liquid two-phase flow and phase-change heat transfer is modified
   by the inner wall surface wavy structure. Based on the measurement of
   the channel wall temperature, the teeth structure and the associated
   cavities generally reduce the heat transfer efficiency compared to the
   straight hose. Furthermore, based on the measured data, a complete
   series of correlations on the heat transfer coefficient for each heat
   transfer regime was developed and reported.}},

   XRD, FT-IR, and SEM techniques were employed to study the effect of
   zirconium on the crystal structure and microstructure of the samples.
   XRD results revealed that spinel MgAl2O4 and t-ZrO2 phases were
   predominant in the samples with low Zr4+ content (10 wt.\%), whereas
   zircon ZrSiO4 was predominant with high Zr4+ content (a parts per
   thousand yen15 wt.\%). The densification behavior was improved from 30.4
   to 44.6\% of the theoretical density (2.6 g/cm(3)) at 15 wt.\% of Zr4+.
   However, microhardness of the sintered samples was enhanced from 7.1 to
   7.5 GPa with increasing the Zr4+ dose from 0 to 25 wt.\%. On the other
   hand, the gradual increase in Zr4+ content from 0 to 25 wt.\% led to
   suppression in the electrical resistivity (rho) from 16.6 to 2.8 x 10(9)

   permittivity (epsilon) of the pure cordierite was decreased with Zr4+

Abstract = {{The healing process exhibited by biological structures has inspired the
   creation of engineered materials capable of impeding crack propagation.
   Furthermore, recent observation of local elastic modification at the
   crack-tip has shown drastic improvement in the fracture behavior of
   materials. By taking advantage of the highly temperature dependent
   elastic properties of a thermo-responsive shape memory polyurethane, an
   annular elastic gradient around the crack-tip is created by applying
   thermal energy. A large reduction (similar to 95\% decreases) in the
   stress intensity factor is obtained. To fully understand the toughening
   mechanism, finite element and micromechanics models are created to
   simulate fracture behavior of a compact tension specimen with local
   property modification of thermo-responsive polymers at the crack-tip.
   The modeling results are validated through the use of a digital image
   correlation technique which can be utilized to provide the stress
   intensity factor at the crack-tip, confirming the toughening mechanism
   and the accuracy of the models.}},

Abstract = {{This article compares the test results of the conventional beam approach
   to those of the Brazilian test related to the durability of

   limitations for durability evaluation. On the other hand, the Brazilian
   test was found to have unique advantages for ingress of saltwater
   solutions in a short period of time and obtained relatively uniform
   stress distributions at the failure surface. The evaluation of the rate
   of stiffness reduction showed that polyvinyl alcohol fibres in saltwater
   solutions have the weakest resistance to crack propagation and
   polypropylene fibres have the greatest. The observed fracture surfaces
   after testing were found to have a uniformly damaged surface and first
   cracks were exactly initiated at the centre of the crack tip.}},

Abstract = {{We study a stochastic interdiction model of Morton et al. IIE
   Transactions, 39 (2007):3-14 that locates radiation sensors at border
   crossings to detect and prevent the smuggling of nuclear material. In
   this model, an interdictor places sensors at customs checkpoints to
   minimize a potential smuggler's maximum probability of crossing a border
   undetected. We focus on a model variant in which the interdictor has
   different, and likely more accurate, perceptions of the system's
   parameters than the smuggler does. We introduce a model that is tighter
   and uses fewer constraints than that of Morton et al. We also develop a
   class of valid inequalities along with a corresponding separation
   procedure that can be used within a cutting-plane approach to reduce
   computational effort. Computational results demonstrate the

Abstract = {{A micromechanical analysis of the representative volume element of a
   unidirectional hybrid composite is performed using finite element
   method. The fibers are assumed to be circular and packed in a hexagonal
   array. The effects of volume fractions of the two different fibers used
   and also their relative locations within the unit cell are studied.
   Analytical results are obtained for all the elastic constants. Modified
   Halpin-Tsai equations are proposed for predicting the transverse and
   shear moduli of hybrid composites. Variability in mechanical properties
   due to different locations of the two fibers for the same volume
   fractions was studied. It is found that the variability in elastic
   constants and longitudinal strength properties was negligible. However,
   there was significant variability in the transverse strength properties.
   The results for hybrid composites are compared with single fiber
   composites. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   mode predicted from molecular dynamics simulations}},
Journal = {{SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{621}},
Pages = {{109-116}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Clusters of Cu on ZnO surfaces are established catalyst systems produced
   by vapor deposition of Cu that consolidates into discrete clusters.
   Factors such as the geometry of the ZnO surface, the nature of the
   interface between Cu and ZnO, and the size and distribution of metal
   clusters strongly control the reactivity and stability of the catalyst.
   Here, we report on the development and use of charge-optimized many-body
   (COMB) potentials to model the deposition and subsequent evolution of Cu
   clusters on ZnO (10 (1) over bar0) using classical molecular dynamics
   (MD) simulations. The simulations predict that the deposited Cu spreads
   to form two-dimensional (2D) structures until the coverage is above 0.4
   monolayers (ML). Thereafter, the 2D structures grow thicker with
   increasing Cu coverage and finally form three-dimensional (3D) clusters.
   The predictions are compared to published experimental data and help to
   elucidate aspects of the growth that are currently the subject of
   controversy in the literature. In addition, the influence of such
   factors as incident cluster deposition energy, ZnO surface temperature,
   and different supports on the surface morphology of the Cu clusters are
   examined. The results are expected to provide useful guidance for the
   improved production of dispersed Cu clusters on ZnO surfaces. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Modeling of wireless channels, especially non-stationary fading
   channels, is important for design and performance analysis of wireless
   communication systems. Recently, we proposed a new approach to modeling
   non-stationary fading channels, based on the theory of evolutionary
   spectrum (ES). In this paper, we develop a time-varying autoregressive
   (AR) model for a non-stationary flat fading channel; specifically, we
   develop a method to determine the time-varying coefficients of the AR
   channel model, given the ES of a non-stationary process. Furthermore,
   with the ES theory, we develop a trace-driven time-varying AR channel
   simulator to generate a non-stationary flat fading process. Simulation
   results show that the ES of the channel gain process produced by our
   joint ES-and-AR-based channel model agrees well with the user-specified
   ES, indicating the accuracy of our joint ES-and-AR-based channel model.

Title = {{Spatial Plateau Algebra for implementing fuzzy spatial objects in

Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},
Pages = {{148-170}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Many geographical applications have to deal with spatial objects that
   reveal an intrinsically vague or fuzzy nature. A spatial object is fuzzy
   if locations exist that cannot be assigned completely to the object or
   to its complement. Spatial database systems and Geographical Information
   Systems (GIS) are currently unable to cope with this kind of data. Based
   on an available abstract data model of fuzzy spatial data types for
   fuzzy points, fuzzy lines, and fuzzy regions that leverages fuzzy set
   theory and fuzzy point set topology, this article proposes a Spatial
   Plateau Algebra that provides spatial plateau data types as an
   implementation of fuzzy spatial data types. Each spatial plateau object
   consists of a finite number of crisp counterparts that are all adjacent
   or disjoint to each other, are associated with different membership
   values, and hence form different plateaus. The formal framework and the
   implementation are based on well known, exact models and implementations
   of crisp spatial data types. Spatial plateau operations as geometric
   operations on spatial plateau objects are expressed as a combination of
   geometric operations on the underlying crisps patial objects. This
   article offers a conceptually clean foundation for implementing a
   database extension for fuzzy spatial objects and their operations, and
   demonstrates the embedding of these new data types as attribute data
   types in a database schema as well as the incorporation of fuzzy spatial
   operations into a database query language. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All

Abstract = {{Magnetoelectric multiferroic materials have the potential to transform a
   range of applications, including tunable microelectronics and multiphase
   memories. However, the coexistence of ferromagnetism and
   ferroelectricity in single-phase materials is quite rare, driving the

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{152-159}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Ecosystem services are those resources and processes provided by
   ecosystems that improve human wellbeing. Emergy is the amount of solar
   energy embedded in the resources consumed by a system. In this paper we
   produced a ranking among nations, based on emergy (expressed in seJ/yr)
   and ecosystem service values (in \$/yr). We document a significant
   correlation between the renewable emergy and ecosystem service values
   aggregated at the national scale. This suggests that ecosystem services
   are somehow dependent on energy and natural resource concentration in
   ecosystems. We also compare the ability of each ecosystem mosaic and
   economy, within national boundaries, to translate energy and matter
   inputs into economically valuable goods and services. For ecosystems
   this is calculated using the ratio between renewable emergy and
   ecosystem service value. In the case of national economies, it can be
   estimated using a ratio of the emergy use by the national economy and
   the GDP of the nation (called Emergy to Money Ratio). In almost all
   cases the ecosystems in a national territory provide a unit of monetary
   output using less emergy inputs than the national economy. Further
   comparison was performed for tropical and equatorial nations,
   continents, biodiversity hotspots, and biogeographical regions. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This paper addresses a multidimensional numerical simulation of the
   saturated flow boiling heat transfer in bubble pumps of
   absorption-diffusion refrigeration cycles. The bubble pump with a shape
   of vertical tube is subjected to a uniform heat flux from the tube outer
   wall surface along the entire pump length. As the bubble pump wall is
   heated, a nonazeotropic mixture of saturated strong ammonia/water
   entering into the bubble pump transforms to ammonia vapor and diluted
   ammonia/water mixture. The weaker ammonia/water mixture is lifted by the
   buoyant force created by the ammonia vapor. The present multidimensional
   numerical simulation was performed using the two-fluid model with the
   equilibrium phase change model and the standard k-epsilon turbulence
   model. The numerical model designed for the present simulation was
   validated through a comparative study referring to available
   experimental data. The present numerical model was compared with the
   one-dimensional model to assess its applicability for numerical
   simulation of the saturated flow boiling heat transfer in bubble pumps.
   As a result, it is seen that the present numerical model predicts the
   performance of ammonia/water bubble pumps more realistically than the
   one-dimensional model. In addition, the effects of the bubble pump's
   geometrical dimension and heat input on the pump performance were
   investigated using the present numerical approach.}},

Title = {{Blood Cell Adhesion on a Polymeric Heart Valve Leaflet Processed Using
   Magnetic Abrasive Finishing}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL DEVICES-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Polymeric heart valves have the potential to improve hemodynamic
   function without the complications associated with bioprosthetic and
   mechanical heart valves, but they have exhibited issues that need to be
   addressed including calcification, hydrolysis, low durability, and the
   adhesion of blood cells on the valves. These issues are attributed to
   the valves' material properties and surface conditions in addition to
   the hemodynamics. To overcome these issues, a new stentless,
   single-component trileaflet polymeric heart valve with engineered
   leaflet surface texture was designed, and prototypes were fabricated
   from a simple polymeric tube. The single-component structure features a
   trileaflet polymeric valve and conduit that are made of a single tube
   component to eliminate complications possibly caused by the interaction
   of multiple materials and components. This paper focuses on the leaflet
   surface modification and the effects of leaflet surface texture on blood
   cell adhesion to the leaflet surface. Silicone rubber was chosen as the
   working material. A magnetic abrasive finishing (MAF) process was used
   to alter the inner surface of the tubular mold in contact with the
   silicone leaflets during the curing process. It was hypothesized that
   the maximum profile height Rz of the mold surface should be smaller than
   the minimum platelet size of 1 mu m to prevent platelets (1-3 mu m in
   diameter) from becoming lodged between the peaks. Cell adhesion studies
   using human whole blood flushed at low shear stresses over leaflet
   surfaces with six different textures showed that adhesion of the
   platelets and red blood cells is greatly influenced by both surface
   roughness and lay. Leaflets replicated from MAF-produced mold surfaces
   consisting of short asperities smaller than 1 mu m reduced blood cell
   adhesion and aggregation. Cell adhesion studies also found that either
   mold or leaflet surface roughness can be used as a measure of cell
   adhesion.}},

Abstract = {{AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) were used to sense
   the binding between double stranded DNA (dsDNA) and the severe acute
   respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nucleocapsid protein (N
   protein). The sensing signals were the drain current change of the HEMTs
   induced by the protein-dsDNA binding. Binding-site models using surface
   coverage ratios were utilized to analyze the signals from the HEMT-based
   sensors to extract the dissociation constants and predict the number of
   binding sites. Two dissociation constants, K-D1 = 0.0955 nM, K-D2 =
   51.23 nM, were obtained by fitting the experimental results into the
   two-binding-site model. The result shows that this technique is more
   competitive than isotope-labeling electrophoretic mobility shift assay
   (EMSA). We demonstrated that AlGaN/GaN HEMTs were highly potential in
   constructing a semiconductor-based-sensor binding assay to extract the
   dissociation constants of nucleotide-protein interaction. (C) 2013

Title = {{How coupon and element tests reduce conservativeness in element failure
   prediction}},
Journal = {{RELIABILITY ENGINEERING \& SYSTEM SAFETY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{123-136}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Structural elements, such as stiffened panels, are designed by combining
   material strength data obtained from coupon tests with a failure theory
   for 3D stress field. Material variability is captured by dozens of
   coupon tests, but there remains epistemic uncertainty due to error in
   the failure theory, which can be reduced by element tests.
   Conservativeness to compensate for the uncertainty in failure prediction
   (as in the A- or B-basis allowables) results in a weight penalty. A key
   question, addressed here, is what weight penalty is associated with this
   conservativeness and how much it can be reduced by using coupon and
   element tests. In this paper, a probabilistic approach is used to
   estimate the conservative element failure strength by quantifying
   uncertainty in the element strength prediction. A convolution integral
   is used to efficiently combine uncertainty from coupon tests and that
   from the failure theory. Bayesian inference is then employed to reduce
   the epistemic uncertainty using element test results. The methodology is
   examined with typical values of material variability (7\%), element test
   variability (3\%), and the error in the failure theory (5\%). It is
   found that the weight penalty associated with no element test is
   significant (20\% heavier than an infinite number of element tests), and
   it is greatly reduced by more element tests (4.5\% for 5 element tests),
   but the effect of the number of coupon tests is much smaller. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The effect of heterovalent B-site doping on ergodicity of relaxor
   ferroelectrics is studied using (1 -
   y)(0.81Bi(1/2)Na(1/2)TiO(3)-0.19Bi(1/2)K(1/2)TiO(3))-yBiZn(1/2)Ti(1/2)O(
   3) (BNT-BKT-BZT) with y - \{0.02;0.03;0.04\} as a model system. Both the
   large- and small-signal parameters are studied as a function of electric
   field. The crystal structure is assessed by means of neutron diffraction
   in the initial state and after exposure to a high electric field. In
   order to measure ferroelastic domain textures, diffraction patterns of
   the poled samples are collected as a function of sample rotation angle.
   Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) is employed to probe the
   microstructure for polar regions at a nanoscopic scale. For low electric
   fields E < 2 kV.mm(-1), large- and small-signal constitutive behavior do
   not change with composition. At high electric fields, however, drastic
   differences are observed due to a field-induced phase transition into a
   long-range ordered state. It is hypothesized that increasing BZT content
   decreases the degree of non-ergodicity; thus, the formation of
   long-range order is impeded. It is suggested that frozen and dynamic
   polar nano regions exist to a different degree, depending on the BZT
   content. This image is supported by PFM measurements. Moreover, PFM
   measurements suggest that the relaxation mechanism after removal of the
   bias field is influenced by surface charges. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing

   with defects positioned in the 2 dimensional electron gas channel region
   and AlGaN barrier using 330 keV protons not only showed degradation of
   both drain current and extrinsic transconductance but also exhibited an
   improvement of the off-state drain breakdown voltage. Finite-element
   simulations showed the enhancement of the latter were due to a reduction

Abstract = {{Knowledge of solute transport in heterogeneous porous media is crucial
   to monitor contaminant fate and transport in soil and groundwater
   systems. In this study, we present new findings from experimental and
   mathematical analysis to improve current understanding of solute
   transport in structured heterogeneous porous media. Three saturated
   columns packed with different sand combinations were used to examine the
   breakthrough behavior of bromide, a conservative tracer. Experimental
   results showed that bromide had different breakthrough responses in the
   three types of sand combinations, indicating that heterogeneity in
   hydraulic conductivity has a significant effect on the solute transport
   in structured heterogeneous porous media. Simulations from analytical
   solutions of a two-domain solute transport model matched experimental
   breakthrough data well for all the experimental conditions tested.
   Experimental and model results show that under saturated flow
   conditions, advection dominates solute transport in both fast-flow and
   slow-flow domains. The sand with larger hydraulic conductivity provided
   a preferential flow path for solute transport (fast-flow domain) that
   dominates the mass transfer in the heterogeneous porous media.
   Importantly, the transport in the slow-flow domain and mass exchange
   between the domains also contribute to the flow and solute transport
   processes and thus must be considered when investigating contaminant
   transport in heterogeneous porous media.}},

Abstract = {{Crystalline solids composed of one-dimensional channels with
   cross-sectional dimensions below 1 nm represent an intriguing class of
   materials with important potential applications. A key characteristic
   for certain applications is the average open channel persistence length,
   i.e., the ensemble average distance from a channel opening to the first
   obstruction. This paper introduces an NMR-based methodology to measure
   this quantity. The protocol is applied to polycrystalline specimens of
   two different dipeptide nanotubes: L-Ala-L-Val and its retro-analog
   L-Val-L-Ala. Persistence lengths derived from the NMR measurements are
   found to be comparable to the typical crystallite dimensions seen in
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, indicating that the crystals
   of these AV and VA specimens are essentially hollow with practically no
   blockages. Applications of the method to an AV sample that has been
   pulverized in a mortar and pestle showed that the open channel
   persistence length was reduced from 50 to 6.6 mu m, consistent with the
   crystallite sizes observed in SEM images.}},

Abstract = {{The objective was to study plutonium partitioning between immobile and
   mobile humic materials at the water-solid interfaces. Immobilization of
   the humic materials on solid supports was performed in situ using
   self-adhesive silanized humic derivatives. The presence of the humic
   adlayers on solid supports was shown to significantly enhance Pu
   sorption and its retention under both steady state and dynamic
   conditions. While plutonium may exist in multiple oxidations states plus
   colloidal forms, the major thrust in this work was to study the behavior
   of most mobile - the PuO2+ form in dilute solutions. The values of the
   plutonium partition coefficients (K-d) between water and humics-coated
   silica gels after 10 days exposure reached 1.6 x 10(4) L center dot
   kg(-1) at pH 7.5 under anaerobic conditions with a total plutonium
   concentration of 1.2 x 10(-8) M exceeding those for the uncoated SiO2
   (6.3 X 10(2) L center dot kg(-1)). Column tests showed substantial
   sequestration of water-borne plutonium (up to 73\%) on the humics-coated
   silica gels. Remobilization experiments conducted under batch conditions
   at different pH values (3.5, 4.5, 7.5) showed that no more than 3\% of
   the sequestered Pu was remobilized from the humics-coated silica gels by
   treatment with dissolved humic materials at environmentally relevant pH
   of 7.5. Consequently, silanized humic materialas can be seen as both
   molecular probes and as potent candidate materials for scavenging mobile
   Pu from an aqueous phase.}},

Abstract = {{The fate of mercury (Hg) in cement processing and products has drawn
   intense attention due to its contribution. to the ambient emission
   inventory. Feeding Hg-loaded coal fly ash to the cement kiln introduces
   additional Hg into the kiln's baghouse filter dust (BFD), and the
   practice of replacing 5\% of cement with the Hg-loaded BFD by cement
   plants has recently raised environmental and occupational health
   concerns. The objective of this study was to determine Hg concentration
   and speciation in BFD as well as to investigate the release of vapor
   phase Hg from storing and processing BFD-added cement. The results
   showed that Hg content in the BFD from different seasons ranged from
   0.91-1.44 mg/kg (ppm), with 62-73\% as soluble inorganic Hg, while Hg in
   the other concrete constituents were 1-3 orders of magnitude lower than
   the BFD. Up to 21\% of Hg loss was observed in the time-series study
   while storing the BFD in the open environment by the end of the seventh
   day. Real-time monitoring in the bench system indicated that high
   temperature and moisture can facilitate Hg release at the early stage.
   Ontario Hydro (OH) traps showed that total Hg emission from BFD is
   dictated by the air exchange surface area. In the bench simulation of
   concrete processing, only 0.4-0.5\% of Hg escaped from mixing and curing
   BFD-added cement. A follow-up headspace study did not detect Hg release
   in the following 7 days. In summary, replacing 5\% of cement with the
   BFD investigated in this study has minimal occupational health concerns
   for concrete workers, and proper storing and mixing of BFD with cement
   can minimize Hg emission burden for the cement plant.}},

Abstract = {{Using a high-speed optical imaging system specifically designed for
   observing the lightning attachment process, we have documented the
   process for stepped, dart, and dart-stepped leaders in an anomalous
   rocket-triggered lightning flash that terminated on a 10m grounded
   utility pole. The initiation of the first return stroke was found to
   occur at a height of 233m above the top of the utility pole and was
   associated with three slow front dE/dt pulses. A time of 1.5 mu s later,
   a fast rise in luminosity at 182m was associated with a fast transition
   dE/dt pulse. The first return stroke propagated bidirectionally from its
   initiation height, as did subsequent return strokes from their
   initiation heights of 81m to 162m above the top of the utility pole. The
   initial upward speed of the first return stroke was 1.4x10(8)m/s, while
   its initial downward speed was 2.2x10(7)m/s. The channel bottom
   luminosity of the first return stroke rose more slowly to a two or more
   times larger amplitude than that of the subsequent stroke luminosities.
   In contrast, the National Lightning Detection Network-derived
   first-return-stroke peak current is smaller than that of the second and
   the third strokes, and our electric field records at 45km show similar
   behavior for the initial field peaks of the first and subsequent
   strokes.}},

Abstract = {{On Banneg Island, France, very high water-level events (6.5 m above the
   astronomical tide) have been observed on the western cliff, exposed to
   large swells from the North Atlantic. The analysis of hydrodynamic
   measurements collected during the storm of 10 February 2009 shows
   unusually high (over 2m) infragravity wave runup events. By comparing
   runup observations to measurements in approximately 7 m of water and
   numerical simulations with a simplified nonlinear model, two distinct
   infragravity bands may be identified: an 80 s infragravity wave,
   produced by nonlinear shoaling of the storm swell; and a 300 s wave,
   trapped on the intertidal platform of the island and generating
   intermittent, low-frequency inundation. Our analysis shows that the 300
   s waves are a key component of the extreme water levels recorded on the
   island.

Title = {{Spatial variability of flow over a river-influenced inner shelf in
   coastal Alabama during spring}},
Journal = {{CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{25-34}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Spring-time water column velocity data in 2011 and density data from a
   series of spring-time hydrographic surveys from 2008 to 2011 were used
   to examine the spatial variability of the circulation over the inner
   shelf of the Mississippi Bight off Mobile Bay. Spring-time
   depth-averaged currents were eastward at all sites, but the vertical
   profiles were different. East of Mobile Bay the along-shelf flow was
   eastward, with an offshore component at the surface and an onshore
   component at depth, indicative of upwelling circulation. West of Mobile
   Bay the along-shelf flow was also eastward, with a characteristic region
   of negative vertical shear in the upper layer of the water column. The
   deeper site had an across-shelf flow structure similar to the east
   sites, while the shallower site exhibited onshore flow throughout the
   water column. These spatial differences are attributed, in part, to the
   seasonally averaged effects of local wind forcing and discharge. In
   terms of wind forcing, the depth-averaged along-shelf current responded
   to along-shelf wind asymmetrically in favor of upwelling (more transport
   in upwelling than during downwelling). Thus, weak seasonal downwelling
   favorable wind conditions did not inhibit the velocity profiles from
   having upwelling circulation. West of Mobile Bay, negative vertical
   shears in the upper portion of the velocity profiles were consistent
   with the influence of freshwater discharge. This freshwater influence is
   supported with available chlorophyll-a data (as a freshwater proxy),
   which showed an enhanced freshwater influence west of Mobile Bay. In
   addition, across-shelf density data showed a shallow lens of freshwater
   west of Mobile Bay. These findings have implications for understanding
   the transport of river-derived nutrients on the Mississippi-Alabama
   shelf. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Vector quantisation provides better rate-distortion performance over
   scalar quantisation even for a random vector with independent
   dimensions. However, the design and implementation complexity of vector
   quantisers is much higher than that of scalar quantisers. To reduce the
   complexity while achieving performance close to optimal vector
   quantisation or better than scalar quantisation, the authors propose a
   new quantisation scheme, which consists of transformation and scalar
   quantisation. The transformation is to decorrelate and raise the
   dimensionality of the input data, for example, to convert a two-axis
   representation in two-dimensional into a tri-axis representation; then
   scalar quantisation is applied to each of the raised dimensions, for
   example, along three axes. The proposed quantiser is asymptotically
   optimal/suboptimal for low/high rate quantisation, especially for the
   quantisation with certain prime number of quantisation levels. The
   proposed quantiser has O(N-2) design complexity, whereas the design
   complexity of VQ is O(N!), where N is the number of quantisation levels
   per dimension. The experimental results show that the average bit-rate
   achieves 0.4-24.5\% lower than restricted/unrestricted polar quantisers
   and rectangular quantisers for signals of circular and elliptical
   Gaussian and Laplace distributions. It holds the potential of improving
   the performance of the existing image and video coding schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Undoped and Sb-doped BiI3 (SBI) single crystals are grown via the
   vertical Bridgman growth technique. Electrical properties, such as
   resistivity and leakage current, in addition to radiation response
   measurements are performed on both BiI3 and SBI single crystal
   detectors. The resistivity of SBI (2.6310(9) Omega.cm) increases by an
   order of magnitude compared to that of BiI3 (1.45 x 10(8) Omega.cm).
   Furthermore, leakage currents of SBI (10(-2) mu A/cm(2)) decrease by
   four orders magnitude relative to BiI3. The radiation response of the
   SBI indicates that less polarization exists under bias for prolonged
   periods of time, making SBI a promising material for use in gamma-ray
   detector applications. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
   predict that Sb forms strong covalent bonds with neighboring iodine ions
   and that the Sb-I dimer can be formed when Sb is doped into the BiI3
   lattice. In addition, defect modeling verifies that substitution of Bi
   ions with Sb and incorporation of Sb in iodine vacancy sites can
   effectively decrease the formation and migration of iodine vacancies,
   which significantly improves radiation detection performance of the
   material.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this research was to use bench-scale testing to simulate a
   two-stage countercurrent sorption process for the removal of dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC) using a variety of sorbents including magnetic ion
   exchange (MIEX) resin, anion exchange resin (AER), granular activated
   carbon (GAC), and powdered activated carbon (PAC). Preliminary
   experiments used surface water from the St. Johns River (SJR), FL, USA
   with raw water DOC of 7.4-27.5 mg/L. Preliminary experiments
   investigated each sorbent at four different mixing speeds and five
   different contact times. MIEX resin, AERs, GACs, and PAC showed 54\%,
   20-30\%, 5-10\%, and 20\% DOC removal at a 30 min contact time in
   preliminary kinetic experiments. DOC removal by the AERs and activated
   carbons was lower than by the MIEX resin even though the AERs and
   activated carbons had higher capacity than the MIEX resin. MIEX resin,
   PFA444 AER, and F400 GAC were selected for additional testing using the
   SJR water and a surface water from Virginia (VA), USA, which had an
   average DOC of 3.2 mg/L. Two hour uptake experiments using MIEX, PFA444,
   and F400 and SJR and VA waters were used to calculate the sorbent dose
   necessary for 99\% removal of the adsorbable fraction of DOC in a
   two-stage countercurrent process. Finally, bench-scale tests were
   conducted using MIEX, PFA444, and F400 and SJR and VA waters to simulate
   the two-stage countercurrent process using the doses calculated from the
   2 h uptake experiments. The average two-stage removal of the adsorbable
   fraction of DOC in SJR water and VA water for F400, PFA444, and MIEX
   were 109\% and 84\%, 90\% and 88\%, and 85\% and 94\%, respectively. The
   results showed that the 2 h uptakes experiments and calculations were
   satisfactory in predicting the doses and corresponding DOC removal in
   the two-stage countercurrent process. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the performance limit of a wireless
   communication system over a fading channel. The system under study
   consists of 1) a finite-buffer discrete-time queueing system on the link
   layer; and 2) a rate-adaptive channel coding system on the physical
   layer. The objective of this paper is to analyze the relationship among
   data rate (R), packet error probability (E), and delay bound (D) under
   the interaction between the link layer and the physical layer. In our
   analysis, we consider three types of packet errors; that is, 1) packet
   drop due to full buffer; 2) packet drop due to delay bound violation;
   and 3) packet decoding error due to channel noise. We obtain an upper
   bound on the packet error probability. Furthermore, by minimizing the
   packet error probability over the transmission rate, we obtain an
   optimal rate control policy that guarantees the user-specified data rate
   and delay bound. In the case of constant arrival, the optimal rate
   control policy results in a rate-error-delay triplet; then, by varying
   data rate and delay bound, we obtain rate-error-delay Pareto-optimal
   surface, which serves as the performance limit of the system under
   study. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{A simplified approach for simulating changes in beach habitat due to the
   combined effects of long-term sea level rise, storm erosion, and
   nourishment}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {{111-120}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Better understanding of the vulnerability of coastal habitats to sea
   level rise and major storm events are aided by the use of simulation
   models. Since coastal habitats also undergo frequent nourishment
   restoration works in order to maintain their viability, vulnerability
   models must be able to assess the combined effects of sea level rise,
   storm surge, and beach nourishment. The Sea Level Affecting Marshes
   Model (SLAMM) was modified and applied to quantify the changes in the
   beach area in a 5-km stretch of beach in Santa Rosa Island, Florida due
   to these combined effects. A new methodology to estimate spatial erosion
   patterns was developed based on measured erosion during three historic
   storm events representing a wide range of storm intensities over the
   study area (named storms Ivan (H5), Dennis (H4), and Katrina (TS)).
   Future major storms over the 2012-2100 period were generated based on
   the frequency distribution of historic storms using 4000 simulations to
   account for uncertainty in the storms temporal distribution. Potential
   effects of individual, successive, and random storms occurring over the
   area under 0-1.5 m nourishment schemes were evaluated. The risk of
   losing the beach habitat in 90 years for different scenarios is studied
   based on probability distribution contours constructed with the model
   results. Simulation results suggest that without nourishment, a major
   storm with a category of tropical storm or higher will reduce the beach
   at the end of the period by 97-100\%. This loss can be reduced to 60\%
   by maintaining a 1-m beach elevation and can further be reduced to 34\%
   with 1.5 m beach nourishment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{The dielectric and piezoelectric properties of ferroelectric
   polycrystalline materials have long been known to be strong functions of
   grain size and extrinsic effects such as domain wall motion. In BaTiO3,
   for example, it has been observed for several decades that the
   piezoelectric and dielectric properties are maximized at intermediate
   grain sizes (approximate to 1 m) and different theoretical models have
   been introduced to describe the physical origin of this effect. Here,
   using in situ, high-energy X-ray diffraction during application of
   electric fields, it is shown that 90 degrees domain wall motion during
   both strong (above coercive) and weak (below coercive) electric fields
   is greatest at these intermediate grain sizes, correlating with the
   enhanced permittivity and piezoelectric properties observed in BaTiO3.
   This result validates the long-standing theory in attributing the size
   effects in polycrystalline BaTiO3 to domain wall displacement. It is now
   empirically established that a doubling or more in the piezoelectric and
   dielectric properties of polycrystalline ferroelectric materials can be
   achieved through domain wall displacement effects; such mechanisms are
   suggested for use in the design of new ferroelectric materials with
   enhanced properties.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The minimum error entropy (MEE) estimation is concerned with the
   estimation of a certain random variable (unknown variable) based on
   another random variable (observation), so that the entropy of the
   estimation error is minimized. This estimation method may outperform the
   well-known minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation especially for
   non-Gaussian situations. There is an important performance bound on the
   MEE estimation, namely the W-S lower bound, which is computed as the

Abstract = {{The bones and soft tissues of the foot act as a shock attenuator and the
   relative bony motions of the talocrural and subtalar joints are the
   subject of research interest for their roles in lower extremity
   pathology. Despite this interest, little information exists on the
   precise in vivo talocrural and subtalar joint kinematics during dynamic
   activities. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to quantify the
   three-dimensional kinematics of the talocrural and subtalar joints
   during landing by using single-plane fluoroscopic imaging and shape
   matching techniques. Three-dimensional bone positions for 6 subjects
   during landing from a 10 cm height were determined by using 3D-2D
   model-image registration techniques. The primary talocrural joint motion
   after toe contact was dorsiflexion with rotation ranges averaging 12
   degrees +/- 7 degrees dorsiflexion, 2 degrees +/- 2 degrees eversion,
   and 3 degrees +/-degrees 2 internal rotation. The subtalar joint
   exhibited similar patterns of increased dorsiflexion, eversion, and
   external rotation up to 150 ms after landing. The angular changes were 5
   degrees +/- 3 degrees dorsiflexion, 7 degrees +/- 3 degrees eversion,
   and 6 degrees +/- 2 degrees external rotation. This study contributes to
   the quantitative understanding of the function of the normal talocrural
   and subtalar joints and can be used for comparison with data obtained
   from injured feet.}},

Abstract = {{Ethiopia is one of the countries most vulnerable to the impacts of
   climate variability and change on agriculture. The present study aims to
   understand and characterize agro-climatic variability and changes and
   associated risks with respect to implications for rainfed crop
   production in the Central Rift Valley (CRV). Temporal variability and
   extreme values of selected rainfall and temperature indices were
   analysed and trends were evaluated using Sen's slope estimator and
   Mann-Kendall trend test methods. Projected future changes in rainfall
   and temperature for the 2080s relative to the 1971-90 baseline period
   were determined based on four General Circulation Models (GCMs) and two
   emission scenarios (SRES, A2 and B1). The analysis for current climate
   showed that in the short rainy season (March-May), total mean rainfall
   varies spatially from 178 to 358mm with a coefficient of variation (CV)
   of 32-50\%. In the main (long) rainy season (June-September), total mean
   rainfall ranges between 420 and 680mm with a CV of 15-40\%. During the
   period 1977-2007, total rainfall decreased but not significantly. Also,
   there was a decrease in the number of rainy days associated with an
   increase (statistically not significant) in the intensity per rainfall
   event for the main rainy season, which can have implications for soil
   and nutrient losses through erosion and run-off. The reduced number of
   rainy days increased the length of intermediate dry spells by 0 center
   dot 8 days per decade, leading to crop moisture stress during the
   growing season. There was also a large inter-annual variability in the
   length of growing season, ranging from 76 to 239 days. The mean annual
   temperature exhibited a significant warming trend of 0 center dot 12-0
   center dot 54 degrees C per decade. Projections from GCMs suggest that
   future annual rainfall will change by +10 to -40\% by 2080. Rainfall
   will increase during November-December (outside the growing season), but
   will decline during the growing seasons. Also, the length of the growing
   season is expected to be reduced by 12-35\%. The annual mean temperature
   is expected to increase in the range of 1 center dot 4-4 center dot 1
   degrees C by 2080. The past and future climate trends, especially in
   terms of rainfall and its variability, pose major risks to rainfed
   agriculture. Specific adaptation strategies are needed for the CRV to
   cope with the risks, sustain farming and improve food security.}},

Abstract = {{There are several studies that have estimated how much water is used for
   residential irrigation, principally at the national level, with outputs
   varying from 30 to 64\% of total household potable water use. A
   methodology to estimate irrigation from potable use data in central
   Florida is presented in this paper. Monthly potable water billing
   records of single-family homes for the City of Tampa Water Department
   (TWD) and Orange County Utilities (OCU), Florida, were available from
   2003 to 2007. Basic indoor water use at the household scale was
   estimated using two methods: the minimum month method and the per capita
   method. A range of impervious surfaces values (5, 15, and 20\% from
   total green area) was considered to estimate the irrigable area.
   Irrigation was estimated on a monthly basis as the difference of total
   water use minus the estimated indoor water use, divided by the irrigable
   area. The estimated irrigation values were compared to a monthly
   theoretical irrigation requirement calculated by a daily soil water
   balance. The average total potable water use was 29.2 and 53.3m3/month
   in TWD and OCU, respectively. The basic indoor water use ranged from
   15.7 to 35.9m3/month in TWD and OCU, respectively, based on the minimum
   month method, and from 16.9 to 18.3m3/month when the per capita method
   was used. Some inaccuracy in the minimum month method was detected, at
   least for OCU, and the per capita method would be better for estimating
   indoor water use. Our results showed that 57-62\% and 45-64\%\% of
   homeowners overirrigated in OCU, with an estimated irrigation amount of
   104-62mm/month when the per capita method and the minimum month method
   were used, respectively. In TWD, 31-36 to 22-27\% of homeowners
   overirrigated when the per capita method and the minimum month method
   were used, with averages of 54 and 31mm/month, respectively. The minimum
   month method showed the lowest estimated values on irrigation compared
   to the per capita method. Further work is needed to determine which
   indoor use method is most accurate.}},

Title = {{Muscle Synergies May Improve Optimization Prediction of Knee Contact
   Forces During Walking}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICAL ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The ability to predict patient-specific joint contact and muscle forces
   accurately could improve the treatment of walking-related disorders.
   Muscle synergy analysis, which decomposes a large number of muscle
   electromyographic (EMG) signals into a small number of synergy control
   signals, could reduce the dimensionality and thus redundancy of the
   muscle and contact force prediction process. This study investigated
   whether use of subject-specific synergy controls can improve
   optimization prediction of knee contact forces during walking. To
   generate the predictions, we performed mixed dynamic muscle force
   optimizations (i.e., inverse skeletal dynamics with forward muscle
   activation and contraction dynamics) using data collected from a subject
   implanted with a force-measuring knee replacement. Twelve optimization
   problems (three cases with four subcases each) that minimized the sum of
   squares of muscle excitations were formulated to investigate how synergy
   controls affect knee contact force predictions. The three cases were:
   (1) Calibrate+Match where muscle model parameter values were calibrated
   and experimental knee contact forces were simultaneously matched, (2)
   Precalibrate+Predict where experimental knee contact forces were
   predicted using precalibrated muscle model parameters values from the
   first case, and (3) Calibrate+Predict where muscle model parameter
   values were calibrated and experimental knee contact forces were
   simultaneously predicted, all while matching inverse dynamic loads at
   the hip, knee, and ankle. The four subcases used either 44 independent
   controls or five synergy controls with and without EMG shape tracking.
   For the Calibrate+Match case, all four subcases closely reproduced the
   measured medial and lateral knee contact forces (R-2 >= 0.94,
   root-mean-square (RMS) error < 66 N), indicating sufficient model
   fidelity for contact force prediction. For the Precalibrate+Predict and
   Calibrate+Predict cases, synergy controls yielded better contact force
   predictions (0.61 < R-2 < 0.90, 83 N < RMS error < 161 N) than did
   independent controls (-0.15 < R-2 < 0.79, 124 N < RMS error < 343 N) for
   corresponding subcases. For independent controls, contact force
   predictions improved when precalibrated model parameter values or EMG
   shape tracking was used. For synergy controls, contact force predictions
   were relatively insensitive to how model parameter values were
   calibrated, while EMG shape tracking made lateral (but not medial)
   contact force predictions worse. For the subject and optimization cost
   function analyzed in this study, use of subject-specific synergy
   controls improved the accuracy of knee contact force predictions,
   especially for lateral contact force when EMG shape tracking was
   omitted, and reduced prediction sensitivity to uncertainties in muscle
   model parameter values.}},

Abstract = {{Robust automated vortex detection algorithms are needed to facilitate
   the exploration of large-scale turbulent fluid flow simulations.
   Unfortunately, robust non-local vortex detection algorithms are
   computationally intractable for large data sets and local algorithms,
   while computationally tractable, lack robustness. We argue that the
   deficiencies inherent to the local definitions occur because of two
   fundamental issues: the lack of a rigorous definition of a vortex and
   the fact that a vortex is an intrinsically non-local phenomenon. As a
   first step towards addressing this problem, we demonstrate the use of
   machine learning techniques to enhance the robustness of local vortex
   detection algorithms. We motivate the presence of an expert-in-the-loop
   using empirical results based on machine learning techniques. We employ
   adaptive boosting to combine a suite of widely used, local vortex
   detection algorithms, which we term weak classifiers, into a robust
   compound classifier. Fundamentally, the training phase of the algorithm,
   in which an expert manually labels small, spatially contiguous regions
   of the data, incorporates non-local information into the resulting
   compound classifier. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by
   applying the compound classifier to two data sets obtained from
   computational fluid dynamical simulations. Our results demonstrate that
   the compound classifier has a reduced misclassification rate relative to
   the component classifiers.}},

Abstract = {{We report using polyurethane (PU) as an elastomer in microvalves
   integrated with thermoplastic microfluidic devices. Elastomer-based
   microvalves have been used in a number of applications and the elastomer
   often used is PDMS. Although it is a convenient material for
   prototyping, PDMS has been recognized to possess shortcomings such as
   solvent incompatibility and unfavorable manufacturability. We
   investigated the use of PU as an elastomer to address the challenges. A
   reliable method was developed to bond hybrid materials such as PU and
   cyclic olefin copolymer. The film thickness from 3.5 to 24.5 m was
   studied to identify an appropriate thickness of PU films for desirable
   elasticity in microvalves. We integrated PU with thermally actuated,
   elastomer-based microvalves in thermoplastic devices. Valve actuations
   were demonstrated, and the relationship between the valve actuation time
   and heater power was studied. We compared PU with PDMS in terms of their
   microvalve performance. Valves with PDMS failed to function after two
   weeks since the thermal-sensitive solution evaporated through porous
   PDMS membrane, whereas the same valve with PU functioned properly after
   eight months. In addition, we evaluated the creep and creep recovery of
   PU, which is a common phenomenon of viscoelastic materials and is
   related to the long-term elastic property of PU after prolonged use.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A spherical shock-tube model is implemented to focus the attention on
   the flow instability produced by the release of the driver mixture of
   gas-particles into the cold driven pure gas. Four discontinuous
   spherical surfaces are produced which are in order from outward to
   inward the Primary Shock, gas Contact Interface, Particle Interface, and
   Secondary Shock. An appropriate methodology is developed to capture the
   base flows and the physics of Rayleigh-Taylor-based instabilities. The
   interaction forces between the two phases and the heat transfer are
   modeled for both the base and the perturbation flows. The parametric
   space is explored by varying the particle characteristics in order to
   reveal the mechanisms involved. The results indicate that the gas-gas
   contact interface remains unstable for the multiphase cases; however,
   the growth rate of the instability is dampened due to the inclusion of
   the particles. Results are compared with theoretical models to explain
   the mechanisms involved. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The slow diffusion of an absorbate molecule into an absorbent often
   makes the absorption process a rate-limiting step in many applications.
   In cases involving an absorbate with a high heat of phase change, such
   as water absorption into a LiBr (lithium bromide) solution, the
   absorption rate is further slowed due to significant heating of the
   absorbent. Recently, it has been demonstrated that constraining a LiBr
   solution film by a hydrophobic porous structure enables manipulation of
   the solution flow thermohydraulic characteristics. Here, it is shown
   that mass transport mode in a constrained laminar solution flow can be
   changed from diffusive to advective. This change in mode is accomplished
   through stretching and folding the laminar streamlines within the
   solution film via the implementation of micro-scale features on the flow
   channel surface. The process induces vortices within the solution film,
   which continuously bring concentrated solution from the bottom and
   middle of the solution channel to its interface with the vapor phase,
   thus leading to a significant enhancement in the absorption rate. The
   detailed physics of the involved transport processes is elucidated using
   the LBM (Lattice Boltzmann Method). Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Impact of Inorganically Bound Sulfur on Late Shale Gas Generation}},
Journal = {{ENERGY \& FUELS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{785-793}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Nonisothermal, confined pyrolysis was applied to a mature shale sample
   from the Ordovician Salgan Formation in Tarim Basin, northwest China.
   Experiments were conducted using gold-tubes with added water at a very
   slow heating rate (2 degrees C/h) and end temperatures between 336 and
   600 degrees C. To investigate the influence of inorganically bound
   sulfur on the generation of gases and to consider the geological
   occurrence of sulfur-containing minerals, such as prevalent pyrite in
   shales, the experiments were carried out with and without admixtures of
   MgSO4, CaSO4, and pyrite. High amounts of methane along with lower
   amounts of wet gases were formed from highly mature shale without
   minerals added, demonstrating a huge late gas generation potential at
   post peak-oil window maturities. In the experiments with added sulfates
   and pyrite, all organic gases were consumed in varying proportions,
   resulting in different chemical and stable carbon isotopic compositions.
   Pyrite treatment affects wet gas (C-2-C-5) evolution directly, but it
   affects methane (C-1) evolution indirectly. In contrast, sulfate
   treatments affect C-1-C-5 evolution directly. The cumulative yield ratio
   of CO2/H2S indicates that pyrite impacts on the hydrocarbon gas
   generation through low valence sulfur such as S-0 or others, which are
   associated with H2S generation. In the pyrite series, the smooth
   increase in ethane yield at temperatures exceeding 504 degrees C,
   together with a concomitant stable carbon isotope reversal, demonstrates
   a new origin for ethane at high temperatures. The isotopic reversal may
   come from reactions between water and solid kerogen/coke/pyrobitumen.
   Isotopic reversal of ethane occurs only in the control and pyrite series
   but not in the sulfate treatments. This provides evidence that anoxic
   conditions are required. Thus, one can expect to encounter isotopic
   reversals in high maturity, unconventional gas shale environments in the
   presence of pyrite.}},

Abstract = {{The ground-based University of Florida L-band Automated Radar System
   (UF-LARS) was developed to obtain observations of normalized radar
   backscatter (sigma(0)) at high temporal resolution for soil moisture
   applications. The system was mounted on a 25 m manlift with capabilities
   of antenna positioning for multi-angle data acquisition and ranging. The
   RF subsystem of UF-LARS was based upon the established designs for
   ground-based scatterometers employing a vector network analyzer with
   simultaneous acquisition of V-and H-polarized returns. System
   integration and automated data acquisition were enabled using a software
   control system. Fifteen-minute observations of sigma(0) collected over a
   growing season of sweet-corn and bare soil conditions in North Central
   Florida, were used to study the sensitivity of sigma(0) to growing
   vegetation and near-surface (0-5 cm) soil moisture (SM0-5). On average,
   sigma(0)(VV) were observed to be 23\% higher than sigma(0)(HH) during
   the mid-and late-stages of crop growth due to the vertical structure of
   stems. The correlation between 3-day observations of SM0-5 and s(VV)(0)
   reduced by 55\% compared to those obtained for <= 30-min observations.
   These findings suggested that data set at high temporal frequencies can
   be used to develop more realistic and robust forward backscattering
   models.}},

Abstract = {{The motion of a droplet on a surface is of importance to many fields.
   While many things are known at the macro-scale still a complete
   understanding of fluid flow at the nano-scale is far from being known.
   This study focuses on the dynamic hydrophobicity of a pillar surface
   with different pillar surface fractions at the nano-scale using
   molecular dynamics simulations. Five pillar heights and four pillar
   surface fractions were modeled using a graphite surface which has
   anisotropic characteristics due to its spaced layers. A nano-sized water
   droplet with 5124 molecules was run to equilibrium on each surface. Then
   a body force was applied and the dynamic contact angles were calculated
   for 5 ns. These contact angles were used to calculate the surface's
   effective hydrophobicity. The droplets were categorized into one of
   three groups as different phenomena were identified depending on the
   pillar surface fraction, applied force, and pillar height. It was found
   that at the nano-scale smooth, flat surfaces are dynamically more
   hydrophobic than any of the cases with pillars. Larger pillar surface
   fractions tended to be more hydrophobic and the pillar surface fraction
   of 36\% was least affected by pillar height and applied body force.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical robustness of microfabricated torsional magnetic
   actuators in withstanding the strong static fields (7 T) and
   time-varying field gradients (17 T/m) produced by an MR system was
   studied in this investigation. The static and dynamic mechanical
   characteristics of 30 devices were quantitatively measured before and
   after exposure to both strong uniform and non-uniform magnetic fields.
   The results showed no statistically significant change in both the
   static and dynamic mechanical performance, which mitigate concerns about
   the mechanical stability of these devices in association with MR systems
   under the conditions used for this assessment. The MR-induced heating
   was also measured in a 3-T/128-MHz MR system. The results showed a
   minimal increase (1.6 A degrees C) in temperature due to the presence of
   the magnetic microactuator array. Finally, the size of the MR-image
   artifacts created by the magnetic microdevices were quantified. The
   signal loss caused by the devices was approximately four times greater
   than the size of the device.}},

Abstract = {{The structure of lignin after dilute phosphoric acid plus steam
   explosion pretreatment process of sugarcane bagasse in a pilot scale and
   the effect of the lignin extracted by ethanol on subsequent cellulose
   hydrolysis were investigated. The lignin structural changes caused by
   pretreatment were identified using advanced nondestructive techniques
   such as gel permeation chromatography (GPC), quantitative C-13, and 2-D
   nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The structural analysis revealed that
   ethanol extractable lignin preserved basic lignin structure, but had
   relatively lower amount of beta-O-4 linkages, syringyl/guaiacyl units
   ratio (S/G), p-coumarate/ferulate ratio, and other ending structures.
   The results also indicated that approximately 8\% of mass weight was
   extracted by pure ethanol. The bagasse after ethanol extraction had an
   approximate 22\% higher glucose yield after enzyme hydrolysis compared
   to pretreated bagasse without extraction. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{FDTD Simulations of Corona Effect on Lightning-Induced Voltages}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTROMAGNETIC COMPATIBILITY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{168-176}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a simplified model of corona discharge for the
   finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) computations has been applied to
   analysis of lightning-induced voltages at different points along a 5-mm
   radius, 1-km long single overhead wire taking into account corona space
   charge around the wire. Both perfectly conducting and lossy ground cases
   were considered. FDTD computations were performed using a 3-D nonuniform
   grid. The progression of corona streamers from the wire is represented
   as the radial expansion of cylindrical weakly conducting (40 mu S/m)
   region around the wire. The magnitudes of FDTD-computed
   lightning-induced voltages in the presence of corona discharge are
   larger than those computed without considering corona. The observed
   trend is in agreement with that reported by Nucci et al. and by Dragan
   et al., although the increase predicted by our full-wave model (up to
   5\% and 9\% for negative and positive lightning return strokes,
   respectively) is less significant than in their studies (up to a factor
   of 2) based on the distributed-circuit model with sources specified
   using the electromagnetic field theory. The disparity is likely to be
   related to the use of different charge-voltage diagrams, explicitly
   assumed by Nucci et al. and Dragan et al. and resulting from our FDTD
   model with corona in the present study. When corona is considered, there
   is a tendency for induced-voltage rise time to increase. It appears that
   the distributed impedance discontinuity, associated with the corona
   development on the wire, is the primary reason for higher
   induced-voltage peaks and longer voltage rise times, compared to the
   case without corona.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{85-89}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We present a long wavelength model in order to derive a simple formula
   for the amplitude at the onset of circulation cells in flow past a wavy
   wall. The flow takes place between a wavy wall and a plane wall and is
   driven by moving the plane wall. There is no amplitude restriction but
   the Reynolds number is small and the wavelength is long. We find
   recirculation cells at an amplitude of about 3/10 the average gap width.
   This is confirmed by a Stokes flow calculation which can be done for all
   wavelengths.
   At long wavelengths the circulation cells can be eliminated if, in
   addition to the moving wall, the flow is driven by gravity. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{An electromagnetically actuated micromirror with precise tilt angle
   control for application as a bi-stable optical switch is reported. A
   tilt angle control of +/- 2.3 degrees is achieved by utilizing the 4 pm
   buried oxide (BOX) layer thickness of an SOI wafer together with a
   carefully controlled pulsed low frequency deep silicon backside etch to
   construct precise mechanical stoppers, while maximizing the torsion beam
   out-of-plane stiffness for angle fixing. The device is packaged with a
   KOH etched textured silicon encapsulation, which prevents reflection
   from the back cavity to promote high contrast, and also increases
   vibration resistance. By incorporating the magnetization response of the
   permalloy material, a compact analytical model for the
   quasi-static/dynamic analysis of the device was constructed, which
   corresponds well with the measured tilt angle versus applied magnetic
   field, frequency response, and switching time. A pulsed voltage driving
   circuit was also applied to increase the electromagnet response speed.
   Latchability can be easily established by employing an electro-permanent
   magnet or electrostatic clamping between the stoppers. The mirror
   reflectivity was measured to be 87.2\% (0.6 dB) at a wavelength of 632.8
   nm, and the static and dynamic deformation of the mirror was also
   measured and reported. The device is suitable for optical
   telecommunication in harsh environments that do not permit any
   electrical sparks. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In wireless networks, Connected Dominating Sets (CDSs) are widely used
   as virtual backbones for communications. On one hand, reducing the
   backbone size will reduce the maintenance overhead. So how to minimize
   the CDS size is a critical issue. On the other hand, when evaluating the
   performance of a wireless network, the hop distance between two
   communication nodes, which reflect the energy consumption and response
   delay, is of great importance. Hence how to minimize the routing cost is
   also a key problem for constructing the network virtual backbone. In
   this paper, we study the problem of constructing applicable CDS in
   wireless networks in terms of size and routing cost. We formulate a
   wireless network as a Disk-Containment Graph (DCG), which is a
   generalization of the Unit-Disk Graph (UDG), and we develop an efficient
   algorithm to construct CDS in such kind of graphs. The algorithm
   contains two parts and is flexible to balance the performance between
   the two metrics. We also analyze the algorithm theoretically. It is
   shown that our algorithm has provable performance in minimizing the CDS
   size and reducing the communication distance for routing.}},

Abstract = {{Detection of immature peach fruits would help growers to create yield
   maps which are very useful tools for adjusting management practices
   during the fruit maturing stages. Machine vision algorithms were
   developed to detect and count immature peach fruit in natural canopies
   using colour images. This study was the first effort to detect immature
   peach fruit in natural environment to the authors' knowledge. Captured
   images had various illumination conditions due to both direct sunlight
   and diffusive light conditions that make the fruit detection task more
   difficult. A training set and a validation set were used to develop and
   to test the algorithms. Different image scanning methods including
   finding potential fruit regions were developed and used to parse fruit
   objects in the natural canopy image. Circular Gabor texture analysis and
   `eigenfruit' approach (inspired by the `eigenface' face detection and
   recognition method) were used for feature extraction. Statistical
   classifiers, a neural network and a support vector machine classifier
   were built and used for detecting peach fruit. A blob analysis was
   performed to merge multiple detections for the same peach fruit.
   Performance of the classifiers and image scanning methods were
   introduced and evaluated. Using the proposed algorithms, 84.6, 77.9 and
   71.2 \% of the actual fruits were successfully detected using three
   different image scanning methods for the validation set.}},

Title = {{A backbone based TSP heuristic for large instances}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEURISTICS}},

Volume = {{20}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We introduce a reduction technique for large instances of the traveling
   salesman problem (TSP). This approach is based on the observation that
   tours with good quality are likely to share many edges. We exploit this
   observation by neglecting the less important tour space defined by the
   shared edges, and searching the important tour subspace in more depth.
   More precisely, by using a basic TSP heuristic, we obtain a set of
   starting tours. We call the set of edges which are contained in each of
   these starting tours as pseudo-backbone edges. Then we compute the
   maximal paths consisting only of pseudo-backbone edges, and transform
   the TSP instance to another one with smaller size by contracting each
   such path to a single edge. This reduced TSP instance can be
   investigated more intensively, and each tour of the reduced instance can
   be expanded to a tour of the original instance. Combining our reduction
   technique with the currently leading TSP heuristic of Helsgaun, we
   experimentally investigate 32 difficult VLSI instances from the
   well-known TSP homepage. In our experimental results we set world
   records for seven VLSI instances, i.e., find better tours than the best
   tours known so far (two of these world records have since been improved
   upon by Keld Helsgaun and Yuichi Nagata, respectively). For the
   remaining instances we find tours that are equally good or only slightly
   worse than the world record tours.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new analytic criterion for porous solids with matrix
   obeying Tresca yield criterion is derived. The criterion is
   micromechanically motivated and relies on rigorous upscaling theorems.
   Analysis is conducted for both tensile and compressive axisymmetric
   loading scenarios and spherical void geometry. Finite element cell
   calculations are also performed for various triaxialities. Both the new
   model and the numerical calculations reveal a very specific coupling
   between the mean stress and the third invariant of the stress deviator
   that results in the yield surface being centro-symmetric and void growth
   being dependent on the third-invariant of the stress deviator.
   Furthermore, it is verified that the classical Gurson's criterion is an
   upper bound of the new criterion with Tresca matrix. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The survivable logical topology routing problem in an IP-over-WDM
   optical network is to map each link (u; v) in the logical topology (at
   the IP layer) into a lightpath between the nodes u and v in the physical
   topology (at the optical layer) such that failure of a physical link
   does not cause the logical topology to become disconnected. It is
   assumed that both the physical and logical topologies are at least
   two-edge connected. For this problem, two lines of investigation have
   been pursued in the literature: one pioneered by Modiano and Narula-Tam
   {[}Proc. IEEE INFO-COM, 2001, p. 348] and the other pioneered by Kurant
   and Thiran {[}Proc. Int. Conf. on Broadband Networks (BROAD-NETS), 2004,
   p. 44]. Since then there has been a great deal of research on this
   problem. Most of the works have not considered limitations imposed on
   the routings by physical capacity limits and other metrics in addition
   to survivability. In this paper, we first introduce two concepts: weakly
   survivable routing and strongly survivable routing. We then provide
   mathematical programming formulations for two problems. The first
   problem is to design a survivable lightpath routing that maximizes the
   logical demand satisfaction before and after a physical link failure.
   The second problem is to add spare capacities to the physical links to
   guarantee routability of all logical link demands before and after a
   physical link failure. We conclude with heuristics that mitigate the
   computational complexity of the mathematical programming formulations
   and with simulation results comparing these heuristics with the
   mathematical programming formulations.}},

Abstract = {{In the development of engineered vascular grafts, assessing the
   material's interactive properties with peripheral blood cells and its
   capacity to endothelialize are important for predicting in vivo graft
   behavior. Current in vitro techniques used for characterizing cell
   adhesion at the surface of engineered scaffolds under flow only
   facilitate a terminal quantification of cell/surface interactions. Here,
   we present the design of an innovative flow chamber for real-time
   analysis of blood-biomaterial interactions under controllable
   hemodynamic conditions. Decellularized human umbilical veins (dHUV) were
   used as model vascular allografts to characterize platelet, leukocyte,
   and endothelial cell (EC) adhesion dynamics. Confluent EC monolayers
   adhered to the lumenal surface of the grafting material were flow
   conditioned to resist arterial shear stress levels (up to 24
   dynes/cm(2)) over a 48h period, and shown to maintain viability over the
   1 week assessment period. The basement membrane was imaged while whole
   blood/neutrophil suspensions were perfused across the HUV surface to
   quantify cell accumulation. This novel method facilitates live
   visualization of dynamic events, including cell adhesion, migration, and
   morphological adaptation at the blood-graft interface on opaque
   materials, and it can be used for preliminary assessment of clinically
   relevant biomaterials before implantation.}},

Title = {{Effects of Al/Si ordering on feldspar dissolution: Part I.
   Crystallographic control on the stoichiometry of dissolution reaction}},
Journal = {{GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{126}},
Pages = {{574-594}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{The incongruent dissolution of feldspar is associated with the formation
   and evolution of Si-rich amorphous interfacial structures during its
   chemical weathering. The stoichiometry of dissolution is compositionally
   dependent, and this dependence reflects the nature of dissolution
   reaction as a combination of surface renewal and heterogeneous chemical
   reaction. We hypothesize that during continuous surface renewal,
   reactive sites on a feldspar's surface will inherit characteristics from
   the bulk structure of the primary mineral. Hence, the dissolution rate
   of feldspar depends not only on water chemistry but also on its
   crystallographic properties. We propose a new formalism to quantify the
   dependence of the dissolution rates of feldspars on their
   crystallographic properties. A correlation between the degree of Al/Si
   ordering and the stoichiometry of feldspar dissolution is predicted
   based on this formalism. This correlation is verified by a combination
   of water chemistry analysis, synchrotron X-ray diffraction with
   structure refinement (HR-XRD), and Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR). We find that the rates of dissolution and the
   degree to which dissolution is incongruent depend on the frequency of
   SiOSi and SiOAl linkages (chemistry) and the crystallographic
   characteristics of these linkages (bond lengths, bond angles, and
   ordering) in the dissolving mineral. The knowledge of Al/Si ordering
   provides a means to quantify the relative abundances of Si atoms with
   different reactivities. Using a C (1) over bar -based structure model,
   we show that the distribution of Al within the Al-rich (T1) type of
   tetrahedral sites has only a minor effect on dissolution stoichiometry,
   whereas the distribution of Al between the T1-type and the Si-rich
   (T2)-type of sites affects dissolution incongruence predominantly. A
   greater extent of disorder results in higher dissolution incongruence.
   As an implication, our results suggest that the formation of interfacial
   structures during silicate dissolution should at least be partially
   affected by reactivity differences among the framework atoms of a
   silicate. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Post-heading heat stress and yield impact in winter wheat of China}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{Wheat is sensitive to high temperatures, but the spatial and temporal
   variability of high temperature and its impact on yield are often not
   known. An analysis of historical climate and yield data was undertaken
   to characterize the spatial and temporal variability of heat stress
   between heading and maturity and its impact on wheat grain yield in
   China. Several heat stress indices were developed to quantify heat
   intensity, frequency, and duration between heading and maturity based on
   measured maximum temperature records of the last 50years from 166
   stations in the main wheat-growing region of China. Surprisingly, heat
   stress between heading and maturity was more severe in the generally
   cooler northern wheat-growing regions than the generally warmer southern
   regions of China, because of the delayed time of heading with low
   temperatures during the earlier growing season and the exposure of the
   post-heading phase into the warmer part of the year. Heat stress between
   heading and maturity has increased in the last decades in most of the
   main winter wheat production areas of China, but the rate was higher in
   the south than in the north. The correlation between measured grain
   yields and post-heading heat stress and average temperature were
   statistically significant in the entire wheat-producing region, and
   explained about 29\% of the observed spatial and temporal yield
   variability. A heat stress index considering the duration and intensity
   of heat between heading and maturity was required to describe the
   correlation of heat stress and yield variability. Because heat stress is
   a major cause of yield loss and the number of heat events is projected
   to increase in the future, quantifying the future impact of heat stress
   on wheat production and developing appropriate adaptation and mitigation
   strategies are critical for developing food security policies in China
   and elsewhere.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change is projected to push the limits of cropping systems and
   has the potential to disrupt the agricultural sector from local to
   global scales. This article introduces the Coordinated Climate-Crop
   Modeling Project (C3MP), an initiative of the Agricultural Model
   Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) to engage a global
   network of crop modelers to explore the impacts of climate change via an
   investigation of crop responses to changes in carbon dioxide
   concentration ({[}CO2]), temperature, and water. As a demonstration of
   the C3MP protocols and enabled analyses, we apply the Decision Support
   System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) CROPGRO-Peanut crop model for
   Henry County, Alabama, to evaluate responses to the range of plausible
   {[}CO2], temperature changes, and precipitation changes projected by
   climate models out to the end of the 21st century. These sensitivity
   tests are used to derive crop model emulators that estimate changes in
   mean yield and the coefficient of variation for seasonal yields across a
   broad range of climate conditions, reproducing mean yields from
   sensitivity test simulations with deviations of ca. 2\% for rain-fed
   conditions. We apply these statistical emulators to investigate how
   peanuts respond to projections from various global climate models, time
   periods, and emissions scenarios, finding a robust projection of modest
   (<10\%) median yield losses in the middle of the 21st century
   accelerating to more severe (>20\%) losses and larger uncertainty at the
   end of the century under the more severe representative concentration
   pathway (RCP8.5). This projection is not substantially altered by the
   selection of the AgMERRA global gridded climate dataset rather than the
   local historical observations, differences between the Third and Fifth
   Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3 and CMIP5), or the use of
   the delta method of climate impacts analysis rather than the C3MP
   impacts response surface and emulator approach.}},

Abstract = {{Accelerated rolling contact fatigue (RCF) experiments on M-50 NIL case
   carburized bearing steel were conducted using a three-ball-on-rod tester
   at high contact stress levels (5.5 GPa) and over several hundred million
   contact cycles to investigate the evolution of plastic deformation zone
   characteristics. A microindentation technique was used to measure the
   changes in the material hardening and softening characteristics within
   the RCF affected zone and represent the changes in the form of
   microhardness maps. These maps revealed regions of considerable material
   hardening inside the plastic zone and softening of material outside the
   hardened region. The results indicate large amount of plastic strain
   accumulation beneath the contact surface via ratcheting due to RCF
   cycling. The hardened and softened regions continue to evolve in
   severity and size with increasing number of RCF cycles. Using the
   Hertzian contact theory, a rationale for the evolution of hardened and
   softened regions during RCF loading is provided. The entire plastic zone
   is shown to be dominated by four different principal stress states which
   contribute to the evolution of these regions during RCF. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Odor problems associated with H2S emissions often result in odor
   complaints from nearby residents of C\&D debris landfills, especially in
   the early morning. As part of a field study conducted on H2S removal
   ability using different cover materials, daily and seasonal H2S
   emissions through a soil cover layer were monitored at a C\&D debris
   landfill to investigate factors affecting H2S emissions. H2S emission
   rates were not a constant, but varied seasonally, with an average
   emission rate of 4.67 x 10(-6) mg m(-2) s(-1). During a the 10-month
   field study, as the H2S concentration increased from 140 ppm to about
   3500 ppm underneath the cover soil in the testing cell. H2S emissions
   ranged from zero to a maximum emission rate of 1.24 x 10(-5) mg m(-2)
   s(-1). Continuous emission monitoring indicated that H2S emissions even
   changed over time throughout the day, generally increasing from morning
   to afternoon, and were affected by soil moisture and temperature.
   Laboratory experiments were also conducted to investigate the effects of
   H2S concentration and cover soil moisture content on H2S emissions. The
   results showed that increased soil moisture reduced H2S emissions by
   retarding H2S migration through cover soil and dissolving H2S into soil
   water. The field study also indicated that due to atmospheric
   dispersion, high H2S emissions may not cause odor problems. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Stainless steel welding generates nano-sized fume particles containing
   toxic metals which may cause serious health effects upon inhalation. The
   objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of an
   amorphous silica encapsulation (ASE) technology by evaluating its silica
   coating efficiency (SCE), particle morphology, and its impact on the
   weld's mechanical properties. Tetramethylsilane (TMS) added to the
   welding shielding gas decomposed at the high-temperature arc zone to
   enable the silica coating. Collected welding fume particles were
   digested by two acid mixtures with different degrees of silica
   solubility, and the measured mass differences in the digests were used
   to determine the SCE. The SCEs were around 48-64\% at the low and medium
   primary shielding gas flow rates. The highest SCE of 76\% occurred at
   the high shielding gas flow rate (30 Lpm) with a TMS carrier gas flow of
   0.64 Lpm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images confirmed the
   amorphous silica layer on the welding fume particles at most gas flow
   rates, as well as abundant stand-alone silica particles formed at the
   high gas flow rate. Metallography showed that welds from the baseline
   and from the ASE technology were similar except for a tiny crack found
   in one particular weld made with the ASE technology. Tensile tests
   showed no statistical difference between the baseline and the ASE welds.
   All the above test results confirm that welding equipment retrofitted
   with the ASE technology has the potential to effectively address the
   toxicity problem of welding fume particles without affecting the
   mechanical properties of the welds. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Zirconia-based dental prostheses undergo various grinding steps and heat
   treatments in preparation for dental patient use. Post-sintered grinding
   induces a tetragonal-to-monoclinic phase transformation that may lead to
   failure. These grinding conditions were simulated on fully sintered
   yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ivoclar IPS e.max Zir-CAD, Ivoclar Vivadent,
   Schaan, Liechtenstein) using two applied loads (10 and 40 N) and
   different sizes of diamond grinding media (15-, 45-, and 70-mu m
   particles). X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy were shown to
   be inadequate to analyze the monoclinic phase within the surface.
   Grazing incidence XRD correctly identified the presence of monoclinic
   phase on the ground zirconia surfaces. However, we conclude that, given
   the resulting ground microstructure, this technique only provides a
   qualitative measure for the depth profiles of the monoclinic phase for
   different grinding conditions. It was shown that regeneration of
   zirconia converts all monoclinic phase to the tetragonal phase,
   including conversion in specimens that were subjected to the harshest
   grinding conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper defines and analyzes a generalization of the classical
   minimum vertex cover problem to the case of two-layer interdependent
   networks with cascading node failures that can be caused by two common
   types of interdependence. Previous studies on interdependent networks
   mainly addressed the issues of cascading failures from a numerical
   simulations perspective, whereas this paper proposes an exact
   optimization-based approach for identifying a minimum-cardinality set of
   nodes, whose deletion would effectively disable both network layers
   through cascading failure mechanisms. We analyze the computational
   complexity and linear 0-1 formulations of the defined problems, as well
   as prove an LP approximation ratio result that generalizes the
   well-known 2-approximation for the classical minimum vertex cover
   problem. In addition, we introduce the concept of a ``depth of
   cascade{''} (i.e., the maximum possible length of a sequence of
   cascading failures for a given interdependent network) and show that for
   any problem instance this parameter can be explicitly derived via a
   polynomial-time procedure. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Despite being one of the most familiar and widely recognized natural
   phenomena, lightning remains relatively poorly understood. Even the most
   basic questions of how lightning is initiated inside thunderclouds and
   how it then propagates for many tens of kilometers have only begun to be
   addressed. In the past, progress was hampered by the unpredictable and
   transient nature of lightning and the difficulties in making direct
   measurements inside thunderstorms, but advances in instrumentation,
   remote sensing methods, and rocket-triggered lightning experiments are
   now providing new insights into the physics of lightning. Furthermore,
   the recent discoveries of intense bursts of X-rays and gamma-rays
   associated with thunderstorms and lightning illustrate that new and
   interesting physics is still being discovered in our atmosphere. The
   study of lightning and related phenomena involves the synthesis of many
   branches of physics, from atmospheric physics to plasma physics to
   quantum electrodynamics, and provides a plethora of challenging unsolved
   problems. In this review, we provide an introduction to the physics of
   lightning with the goal of providing interested researchers a useful
   resource for starting work in this fascinating field. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Tungsten nitrido complexes of the form WN(NR2)(3) {[}R = combinations of
   Me, Et, Pr-i, `' Pr] have been synthesized as precursors for the
   chemical vapor deposition of WNxCy, a material of interest for diffusion
   barriers in Cu-metallized integrated circuits. These precursors bear a
   fully nitrogen coordinated ligand environment and a nitrido moiety (W 
   N) designed to minimize the temperature required for film deposition.
   Mass spectrometry and solid state thermolysis of the precursors
   generated common fragments by loss of free dialkylamines from monomeric
   and dimeric tungsten species. DFT calculations on WN(NMe2)(3) indicated
   the lowest gas phase energy pathway for loss of HNMe2 to be beta-H
   transfer following formation of a nitrido bridged dimer. Amorphous films
   of WNxCy were grown from WN(NMe2)(3) as a single source precursor at
   temperatures ranging from 125 to 650 degrees C using aerosol-assisted
   chemical vapor deposition (AACVD) with pyridine as the solvent. Films
   with stoichiometry approaching W2NC were grown between 150 and 450
   degrees C, and films grown at 150 degrees C were highly smooth, with a
   RMS roughness of 0.5 nm. In diffusion barrier tests, 30 nm of film
   withstood Cu penetration when annealed at 500 degrees C for 30 min.}},

Abstract = {{Very low frequency (VLF) remote sensing observations of multifaceted
   local and conjugate ionospheric perturbations from geographically
   identified and well-characterized oceanic lightning discharges are
   presented for the first time. Lightning-induced electron precipitation
   (LEP) events are shown to produce disturbances first in the conjugate
   hemisphere and subsequently in the hemisphere of the causative lightning
   discharge in agreement with theoretical predictions. A rough threshold
   peak current of approximate to 100 kA is identified for lightning
   discharges to generate LEP events for the geomagnetic conditions present
   during observations. The occurrence of early VLF events and the
   subsequent duration of their recovery do not seem to fit any simple
   metric of lightning discharge peak current or proximity to great circle
   path. Knowledge of the full spectral density of the lightning
   electromagnetic pulse, not just its peak current, and the subionospheric
   mode structure are likely necessary to determine if a specific lightning
   discharge will generate an early VLF perturbation.

Abstract = {{We investigate the structure of X-ray emissions from downward triggered
   lightning leaders using a pinhole-type X-ray camera (XCAM) located at
   the International Center for Lightning Research and Testing. This study
   builds on the work of Dwyer et al. (2011), which reported results from
   XCAM data from the 2010 summer lightning season. Additional details
   regarding the 2010 data are reported here. During the 2011 summer
   lightning season, the XCAM recorded 12 out of 17 leaders, 5 of which
   show downward leader propagation. Of those five leaders, one
   dart-stepped leader and two chaotic dart leaders are the focus of this
   paper. These three leaders displayed unique X-ray emission patterns: a
   chaotic dart leader displayed a diffuse structure (i.e., a wide lateral
   ``spraying{''} distribution of X-rays), and a dart-stepped leader and a
   chaotic dart leader exhibited compact emission (i.e., a narrow lateral
   distribution of strong X-ray emission). These two distinct X-ray
   emission patterns (compact and diffuse) illustrate the variability of
   lightning leaders. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the
   diffuse X-ray source must originate from a diffuse source of energetic
   electrons or possibly emission from several sources. The compact X-ray
   sources originate from compact electron sources, and the X-ray source
   region radius and electric charge contained within the X-ray source
   region were between 2 and 3 m and on the order of 10-4 C, respectively.
   For the leaders under investigation, the X-ray source region average
   currents were determined to be on the order of 102 A.}},

Title = {{Genesis of interictal spikes in the CA1: a computational investigation}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEURAL CIRCUITS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JAN 27}},
Abstract = {{Interictal spikes (IISs) are spontaneous high amplitude, short time
   duration <400 ms events often observed in electroencephalographs (EEG)
   of epileptic patients. In vitro analysis of resected mesial temporal
   lobe tissue from patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy has
   revealed the presence of IIS in the CA1 subfield. In this paper, we
   develop a biophysically relevant network model of the CA1 subfield and
   investigate how changes in the network properties influence the
   susceptibility of CA1 to exhibit an IIS. We present a novel template
   based approach to identify conditions under which synchronization of
   paroxysmal depolarization shift (PDS) events evoked in CA1 pyramidal
   (Py) cells can trigger an IIS. The results from this analysis are used
   to identify the synaptic parameters of a minimal network model that is
   capable of generating PDS in response to afferent synaptic input. The
   minimal network model parameters are then incorporated into a detailed
   network model of the CA1 subfield in order to address the following
   questions: (1) How does the formation of an IIS in the CA1 depend on the
   degree of sprouting (recurrent connections) between the CA1 Py cells and
   the fraction of CA3 Shaffer collateral (SC) connections onto the CA1 Py
   cells? and (2) Is synchronous afferent input from the SC essential for
   the CA1 to exhibit IIS? Our results suggest that the CA1 subfield with
   low recurrent connectivity (absence of sprouting), mimicking the
   topology of a normal brain, has a very low probability of producing an
   IIS except when a large fraction of CA1 neurons (>80\%) receives a
   barrage of quasi-synchronous afferent input (input occurring within a
   temporal window of <= 24 ms) via the SC. However, as we increase the
   recurrent connectivity of the CA1 (P-sprout > 40); mimicking sprouting
   in a pathological CA1 network, the CA1 can exhibit IIS even in the
   absence of a barrage of quasi-synchronous afferents from the SC (input
   occurring within temporal window >80 ms) and a low fraction of CA1 Py
   cells (approximate to 30\%) receiving SC input. Furthermore, we find
   that in the presence of Poisson distributed random input via SC, the CA1
   network is able to generate spontaneous periodic IISs(approximate to
   3Hz) for high degrees of recurrent Py connectivity (P-sprout > 70). We
   investigate the conditions necessary for this phenomenon and find that
   spontaneous IISs closely depend on the degree of the network's intrinsic
   excitability.}},

   Emphysema in Mice}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JAN 27}},
Abstract = {{Secondhand smoke (SHS) has been associated with a variety of adverse
   health outcomes in nonsmokers, including emphysema (a chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease). One way to detect SHS exposure is to
   measure the concentration of cotinine, the primary metabolite of
   nicotine, in bodily fluids. We have developed a method for cotinine
   analysis by combining micellar electrokinetic chromatography with
   enrichment techniques. We employed the method to measure cotinine
   concentrations in serum samples of mice exposed to tobacco smoke for 12
   or 24 weeks and found that it was 3.1-fold or 4.8-fold higher than those
   exposed to room air for the same period. Further, we investigated the
   morphological changes in lungs of mice and observed tobacco smoke
   induced emphysema. Our results indicate that the method can be used to
   measure cotinine and there is an association between the serum cotinine
   concentration and tobacco smoke-induced emphysema in mice.}},

Title = {{Nutrient depletion in Bacillus subtilis biofilms triggers matrix
   production}},
Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{JAN 23}},
Abstract = {{Many types of bacteria form colonies that grow into physically robust
   and strongly adhesive aggregates known as biofilms. A distinguishing
   characteristic of bacterial biofilms is an extracellular polymeric
   substance (EPS) matrix that encases the cells and provides physical
   integrity to the colony. The EPS matrix consists of a large amount of
   polysaccharide, as well as protein filaments, DNA and degraded cellular
   materials. The genetic pathways that control the transformation of a
   colony into a biofilm have been widely studied, and yield a
   spatiotemporal heterogeneity in EPS production. Spatial gradients in
   metabolites parallel this heterogeneity in EPS, but nutrient
   concentration as an underlying physiological initiator of EPS production
   has not been explored. Here, we study the role of nutrient depletion in
   EPS production in Bacillus subtilis biofilms. By monitoring
   simultaneously biofilm size and matrix production, we find that EPS
   production increases at a critical colony thickness that depends on the
   initial amount of carbon sources in the medium. Through studies of
   individual cells in liquid culture we find that EPS production can be
   triggered at the single-cell level by reducing nutrient concentration.
   To connect the single-cell assays with conditions in the biofilm, we
   calculate carbon concentration with a model for the reaction and
   diffusion of nutrients in the biofilm. This model predicts the
   relationship between the initial concentration of carbon and the
   thickness of the colony at the point of internal nutrient deprivation.}},

Abstract = {{Si-doped HfO2 was prepared by solid state synthesis of the starting

   rather than HfSiO4, the latter of which would be expected from existing
   SiO2-HfO2 phase diagrams. Crystallographic refinement with increased
   Si-dopant concentration in monoclinic HfO2 shows that c/b increases,
   while beta decreases. The spontaneous strain, which characterizes the
   ferroelastic distortion of the unit cell, was calculated and shown to
   decrease with increasing Si substitution. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   evolution for possible intervention. Here we demonstrate using a rat
   model of generalized epilepsy that diffuse optical tomography (DOT)
   provides a unique functional neuroimaging modality for noninvasively and
   continuously tracking such brain activities with high spatiotemporal
   resolution. We detected early hemodynamic responses with heterogeneous
   patterns, along with intracranial electroencephalogram gamma power
   changes, several minutes preceding the electroencephalographic seizure
   onset, supporting the presence of a ``pre-seizure'' state. We also
   observed the decoupling between local hemodynamic and neural activities.
   We found widespread hemodynamic changes evolving from local regions of
   the bilateral cortex and thalamus to the entire brain, indicating that
   the onset of generalized seizures may originate locally rather than
   diffusely. Together, these findings suggest DOT represents a powerful
   tool for mapping early seizure onset and propagation pathways.}},

Abstract = {{The adsorption of CO on clean and oxidized Pd(111) surfaces has been
   investigated using a combination of high-resolution core level
   spectroscopy (HRCLS), reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy

   RAIRS measurements reveal that CO adsorbs on Pd(111), Pd(5)O4 and
   PdO(101) at 100 +/- 10 K and that the CO coverage decreases with
   increasing oxidation state of Pd for the same CO exposures of 10
   Langmuirs. Based on the DFT calculations, the CO layer on clean Pd(111)
   was found to include molecular adsorption in both hollow and bridge
   sites, whereas CO occupies a combination of bridge and atop sites on the
   Pd5O4 and PdO(101) surfaces.}},

Title = {{Modeling of H2S migration through landfill cover materials}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{264}},
Pages = {{254-260}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{The emission of H2S from landfills in the United States is an emergent
   problem because measured concentrations within the waste mass and in
   ambient air have been observed at potentially unsafe levels for on-site
   workers and at levels that can cause a nuisance and potentially
   deleterious health impacts to surrounding communities. Though recent
   research has provided data on H2S concentrations that may be observed at
   landfills, facility operators and landfill engineers have limited
   predictive tools to anticipate and plan for potentially harmful H2S
   emissions. A one-dimensional gas migration model was developed to assist
   engineers and practitioners better evaluate and predict potential
   emission levels of H2S based on four factors: concentration of H2S below
   the landfill surface (C-0), advection velocity (nu), H2S effective
   diffusion coefficient (D), and H2S adsorption coefficient of landfill
   cover soil (mu). Model simulations indicated that H2S migration into the
   atmosphere can be mitigated by reducing H2S diffusion and advection or
   using alternative cover soils with a high H2S adsorption coefficient.
   Laboratory column experiments were conducted to investigate the effects
   of the four parameters on H2S migration in cover soils and to calculate
   the adsorption coefficient of different cover materials. The model was
   validated by comparing results with laboratory column experiments. Based
   on the results, the laboratory column provides an effective way to
   estimate the H2S adsorption coefficient, which can then be incorporated
   into the developed model to predict the depth of cover soil required to
   reduce emitted H2S concentrations below a desired level. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The effects of ionic strength (IS) reduction (5-0.05 mM) and flow
   interruption (FI, flow stopped for 7 d) on colloid and Hg release in the
   leachate were examined in column experiment. Two Hg contaminated soils
   (13.9 and 146 mg/kg) were used, with Hg concentrations in colloids being
   2-4 times greater than bulk soils. Based on sequential extraction, Hg
   concentrations in organic matter (OM) fraction were the most abundant in
   soils (31-48\%). Column leaching after IS reduction and FI released
   large amounts of colloidal Hg, accounting for 44-48\% of released Hg.
   The highest colloidal Hg concentrations at 27.8 and 360 mu g/L were
   observed at similar to 1 pore volume after FI. Concentration
   distribution of colloidal OM and colloidal Fe was similar to colloidal
   Hg in the leachate, showing peak concentrations after IS reduction and
   Fl. Most of the released colloidal Hg was in OM fraction (37-53\%), with
   some in Fe/Mn oxide fraction (11-19\%). Based on composition of released
   colloids and Hg fractionation in soils and colloids, colloidal OM could
   serve as an important carrier for Hg transport in soils. Published by

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{941-952}},

Abstract = {{The spatial and temporal characteristics of the visual and acoustic
   sensory input are indispensable attributes for animals to perform scene
   analysis. In contrast, research in olfaction has focused almost
   exclusively on how the nervous system analyzes the quality and quantity
   of the sensory signal and largely ignored the spatiotemporal dimension
   especially in longer time scales. Yet, detailed analyses of the
   turbulent, intermittent structure of water-and air-borne odor plumes
   strongly suggest that spatio-temporal information in longer time scales
   can provide major cues for olfactory scene analysis for animals. We show
   that a bursting subset of primary olfactory receptor neurons (bORNs) in
   lobster has the unexpected capacity to encode the temporal properties of
   intermittent odor signals. Each bORN is tuned to a specific range of
   stimulus intervals, and collectively bORNs can instantaneously encode a
   wide spectrum of intermittencies. Our theory argues for the existence of
   a novel peripheral mechanism for encoding the temporal pattern of odor
   that potentially serves as a neural substrate for olfactory scene
   analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Innovative technologies incorporating engineered nanoparticles into
   biochar production systems could improve the functions of biochar for
   many applications including soil fertility enhancement, carbon
   sequestration and wastewater treatment. In this study, hybrid
   multi-walled carbon nanotube (CNT)coated biochars were synthesized by
   dip-coating biomass in varying concentrations of carboxyl-functionalized
   CNT solutions (0.01\% and 1\% by weight) prior to slow pyrolysis.
   Untreated hickory and bagasse biochars (HC and BC, respectively) and
   CNT-biochar composites (HC-CNT and BC-CNT, respectively) were
   characterized, and the methylene blue (MB) sorption ability of the
   resulting chars was evaluated in batch sorption experiments. The
   addition of CNTs significantly enhanced the physiochemical properties of
   the biochars with HC-CNT-1\% and BC-CNT-1\% exhibiting the greatest
   thermal stabilities, surface areas (351 and 390 m(2) g(-1),
   respectively), and pore volumes (0.14 and 0.22 cc g(-1), respectively).
   Sorption kinetic and isotherm data showed that, among the biochars
   examined, BC-CNT-1\% had the highest MB sorption capacity (6.2 mg
   g(-1)). While increased pH (up to similar to 7), promoted the uptake of
   MB by all the biochars, whether coated or not, increasing ionic strength
   decreased the uptake of MB by all biochars tested. These findings
   suggest that electrostatic attraction was the dominant mechanisms for
   the sorption of MB onto the chars, though diffusion controlled its rate.
   Hybridized CNT-biochar nanocomposite can thus be considered a promising,
   inexpensive sorbent material for removing dyes and organic pollutants
   from aqueous systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Isoindigo (iI) has proven successful as an electron-accepting building
   block for the preparation of electroactive materials for organic
   electronics. Its high yielding and scalable synthesis has enabled the
   rapid development of a large number of molecular and polymeric iI-based
   materials with remarkable physical properties. This perspective provides
   an overview of the fundamental properties of isoindigo and summarizes
   the progress in the development of new materials for varied electronic
   applications during the last 3 years, focusing in particular on organic
   photovoltaics (OPVs) and organic field effect transistors (OFETs). The
   fundamental electronic properties of isoindigo are discussed in the
   context of the substitution pattern effect (5,5' vs 6,6') on the
   frontier orbitals energies and optical properties. The development of
   molecular systems in the 6,6'-iI configuration for OPVs is examined with
   an emphasis on molecular design for improved electronic properties thank
   to fine-tuning of the active layer morphology via crystallization
   control. Numerous copolymers of iI have been reported, with both
   electron-rich and electron-poor comonomers. The homopolymer of isoindigo
   displays electron-accepting and electrochromic properties and serves as
   a polymeric surrogate for fullerenes in all-polymer solar cells. The
   copolymers' absorption profiles span the entire visible spectrum into
   the near-infrared, up to 900 nm. Bulk-heterojunction solar cells based
   on iI copolymers have reached up to 6.3\% efficiency. While the effect
   of processing additives and cell architecture are important, the unique
   electronic properties of iI polymers also provide useful insight on
   energetic losses within blends with fullerenes. Selected copolymers also
   perform highly in air-stable field effect transistors, with p-type
   mobilities exceeding 3 cm(2)/(V s). New concepts concerning the effect
   of backbone curvature and side-chain branching or polarity have been
   investigated using iI copolymers. Additionally, some all-acceptor
   copolymers display n-type mobility. As the design of iI materials
   evolves, structural modifications of the iI core emerge, targeting
   ambipolar charge transport and enhanced backbone planarity. Overall,
   isoindigo provides the field of organic electronics with impressive
   performance as well as a valuable platform for structure property
   relationship investigation.}},

Month = {{JAN 10}},
Abstract = {{Pulsing is prevalent in nature. As resource pulse has been recognized as
   one of the major factors influencing ecosystem structures and processes,
   it is important to investigate why nature pulses and what benefits an
   ecosystem obtains from pulsed resources. The main question of this study
   was that if a system could be exposed to either constant external
   resources or pulsed external resources of the same temporal average
   intensity, which resources would maximize power acquisition of a system.
   To answer the question, this study tested how matching of pulsed
   resources affects total empower acquisition of a system using numerical
   simulation models and a refined dynamic emergy accounting method. A
   producer-consumer model system was built and simulated by varying phases
   and frequencies of pulsed energy sources. It was hypothesized that
   matching of frequency and phase among two or more pulsed energy sources
   increases the empower acquisition of a system, compared with a system
   under constant energy sources. The simulation results showed that in
   systems of two energy sources, matching phases and frequencies of the
   pulsed energy sources involved in primary production is critical to
   increase total empower acquisition and consumer energy storage. The
   primary mechanism was that the matching of pulsed resources in phase and
   frequency promotes energy acquisition of primary producers that is
   further efficiently transferred for the production of consumers. Energy
   acquisition of consumers was strongly correlated with total empower
   acquisition of the system presumably because the consumers are in the
   high energy hierarchical position controlling the producers thus
   contributing to the total empower acquisition through the system. (C)

Volume = {{106}},

Pages = {{7-15}},

Abstract = {{The cytoskeletal forces involved in translocating the nucleus in a
   migrating tissue cell remain unresolved. Previous studies have variously
   implicated actomyosin-generated pushing or pulling forces on the
   nucleus, as well as pulling by nucleus-bound microtubule motors. We
   found that the nucleus in an isolated migrating cell can move forward
   without any trailing-edge detachment. When a new lamellipodium was
   triggered with photoactivation of Rac1, the nucleus moved toward the new
   lamellipodium. This forward motion required both nuclear-cytoskeletal
   linkages and myosin activity. Apical or basal actomyosin bundles were
   found not to translate with the nucleus. Although microtubules dampen
   fluctuations in nuclear position, they are not required for forward
   translocation of the nucleus during cell migration. Trailing-edge
   detachment and pulling with a microneedle produced motion and
   deformation of the nucleus suggestive of a mechanical coupling between
   the nucleus and the trailing edge. Significantly, decoupling the nucleus
   from the cytoskeleton with KASH overexpression greatly decreased the
   frequency of trailing-edge detachment. Collectively, these results
   explain how the nucleus is moved in a crawling fibroblast and raise the
   possibility that forces could be transmitted from the front to the back
   of the cell through the nucleus.}},

Abstract = {{Serial manipulators are often used in biomechanical testing of human
   joints because they are precise, repeatable instruments that can create
   interesting loading scenarios. Unfortunately, commercial serial
   manipulators often do not have acceptable global positional accuracy due
   to manufacturing tolerances, assembly errors, and other mechanical
   imperfections. Numerous calibration methods have been reported which
   calibrate geometric and non-geometric parameters to reduce static
   position errors under constant loading conditions. However, the
   manipulator's global accuracy during continuous motion with time-varying
   external loading conditions is often not addressed but is necessary for
   joint biomechanical testing. Using the Mitsubishi PA10-6CE as a case
   study, a novel functional calibration procedure was developed that
   performs both static and dynamic calibration. The calibration uses
   optimization techniques to populate a 34-parameter model that accounts
   for the robot's geometric and non-geometric parameters and significantly
   reduces the mean/peak static and dynamic position errors to 0.368/0.67
   mm and 0353/0.81 mm, respectively, while externally loaded. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{A simple methodology for the design of state feedback controllers for
   nonlinear continuous-time systems is introduced. The objective is to
   develop controllers that drive a nonlinear system from an initial
   condition into an assigned region of state space. It is shown that such
   state feedback controllers can be derived by solving a set of
   inequalities obtained directly from quantities given in the controlled
   system's equation. The results are applied to the design of state
   feedback controllers that achieve robust asymptotic stabilisation for a
   rather general class of nonlinear systems.}},

Abstract = {{Quantized kernel least mean square (QKLMS) algorithm is an effective
   up-to-date adaptive nonlinear learning algorithm which also has good
   performance for kernel structure growing control. It achieves good
   results under Gaussian noise environment. In this paper, a new
   algorithm, quantized kernel least mean mixed norm (QKLMMN), is proposed
   for adaptive nonlinear learning with non-Gaussian additive noise
   statistical distribution models (including combination). As an
   alternative of conventional squared error criteria, mixed-norm criteria
   is utilized for our algorithm. A comprehensive convergence analysis is
   carried out. Experiments for nonlinear time series prediction and
   nonlinear system identification are conducted. Experimental results
   verified the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed algorithm
   compared with other kernel based adaptive nonlinear learning algorithms
   under non-Gaussian noise environment.}},

Abstract = {{Many complex networks commonly exhibit community structure in their
   underlying organizations, i.e., they contain multiple groups of nodes
   having more connections inside a group and less interactions among
   groups. This special structure not only offers key insights into
   understanding the network organization principles but also plays a vital
   role in maintaining the normal function of the whole system. As a
   result, any significant change to the network communities, due to
   element-wise failures, can potentially redefine their organizational
   structures and consequently lead to the malfunction or undesirable
   corruption of the entire system. Therefore, identifying network elements
   that are essential to its community structure is a fundamental and
   important problem. However, to the best of our knowledge, this research
   direction has not received much been attention in the literature.
   In this paper, we study the structural vulnerability of overlapping
   complex network communities to identify nodes that are important in
   maintaining the complex structure organization. Specifically, given a
   network and a budget of k nodes, we want to identify k critical nodes
   whose their exclusions transforms the current network community
   structure. To effectively analyze this vulnerability on overlapping
   communities, we propose the concept of generating edges and provide an
   optimal algorithm for detecting the Minimal Generating Edge Set (MGES)
   in a network community. We suggest genEdge, an effective solution based
   on this MGES. Empirical results on both synthesized networks with known
   community structures, and real data including Reality cellular data,
   Foursquare and Facebook social traces confirm the efficacy of our
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{Over 11,000 people sustain spinal cord injury (SCI) each year in the
   United States {[}1]. Researchers have examined spinal progenitor cell
   implantation into the injury area to encourage axonal regeneration and
   found functional improvement with this treatment {[}2]. However,
   transplanted cell viability was low and there was no scaffold for axonal
   growth within the injured area. By providing a scaffold, cell viability
   should increase and axonal growth through the injury area should be
   supported. Further, the implanted spinal progenitor cells differentiated
   into astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes. Oligodendrocyte
   progenitors are promising in promoting functional recovery {[}3].
   Oligodendrocytes mature during neonatal development; therefore, cells
   are expected to respond favorably to mechanical properties similar to
   the neonatal environment. The mechanical and extracellular matrix
   properties of the scaffolds described here have been tuned to direct
   spinal progenitor cell differentiation toward oligodendrocytes.
   Thermally gelling systems were developed in 4 combinations: collagen
   alone, collagen and laminin, collagen and high molecular weight
   hyaluronic acid (hHA), and collagen, hHA, and laminin. All of these gel
   types have the same concentration of collagen (1.5 mg/mL), and
   compressive moduli below 2 kPa, which is within range of neural tissue
   (between 0.5-8 kPa) {[}4]. Multi-component hydrogels mimic mechanical
   properties of neonatal neural tissue most closely. After 5 days in
   culture, hydrogels provided an environment that allowed for spinal
   progenitor differentiation into astrocytes, neurons, and
   oligodendrocytes. Collagen-based hydrogels are viable thermally gelling
   systems to direct progenitor differentiation. These gels may promote
   regeneration after SCI in vivo by directing cell differentiation toward
   oligodendrocytes.}},

Abstract = {{Particle filter and sparse representation have been successfully applied
   to visual tracking in computer vision community. This paper proposes an
   adaptive weighted coarse-to-fine sparse tracking(WCFT) method based on
   particle filter framework. In this method, two series of templates,
   coarse templates and fine templates, are used to represent two different
   stages of human vision perception process respectively. Besides, the
   regularization parameter(weight) of each template is adapted according
   to its significance in representing the target. We also prove that our
   problem can be solved using an accelerated proximal gradient(APG)
   method. Moreover, we prove that the outstanding L1 tracker is a special
   case of our model and our method is more effective and efficient in
   general. The superiority of our system over current state-of-art
   tracking methods is demonstrated by a set of comprehensive experiments
   on public data sets.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a general solution for the multi-source high
   resolution real-time monitoring system. Our proposed system is realized
   on a PCI bus-based real-time image processing board, based on H.264
   video compression standards. The main function of the system includes
   video decompression, image scaling, image stitching, as well as
   multi-mode real-time display in PC software. Unlike traditional
   multi-board based multi-source surveillance system, our solution focuses
   on single board system with synchronously processing and independently
   display of multi-source video, which is more resource-saving. The main
   contributions of this paper are twofold: firstly, we propose a new
   logical control method of multi-thread to overcome the limitation of
   single-board bandwidth, and secondly we give a DirectDraw based display
   solution to avoid screen flicker caused by different frame rates of
   multi-source. In addition, we elaborate an approach on multi-thread

Abstract = {{The partial least squares (PLS) is designed for prediction problems when
   the number of predictors is larger than the number of training samples.
   PLS is based on latent components that are linear combinations of all of
   the original predictors, it automatically employs all predictors
   regardless of their relevance. This will degrade its performance and
   make it difficult to interpret the result. In this paper, global sparse
   PLS (GSPLS) is proposed to allow common variable selection in each
   deflation process as well as dimension reduction. We introduce the
   l(2,1) norm to direction matrix and develop an algorithm for GSPLS via
   employing the Bregmen Iteration algorithm, illustrate the performance of
   proposed method with an analysis to red wine dataset. Numerical studies
   demonstrate the superiority of proposed GSPLS compared with standard PLS

   decrease when more variable were employed for prediction when the joint
   distribution of variables are known. Based on this analysis, in sense of

Abstract = {{Spectrograms provide an effective way for time-frequency representation
   (TFR). Among these, short-time Fourier transform (STFT) based
   spectrograms are extensively used for various applications. However,
   STFT spectrogram and its revised versions suffer from two main issues:
   (1) there is a trade-off between time resolution and frequency
   resolution, and (2) almost all existing TFR methods, including STFT
   spectrogram, are not suitable to deal with nonuniformly sampled data. In
   this paper, we address these two problems by presenting alternative
   approaches, namely short-time amplitude and phase estimation (ST-APES)
   and short-time sparse learning via iterative minimization (ST-SLIM), to
   improve the resolution of STFT based spectrogram, and extend the
   applicability of our approaches to signals with arbitrary sampling
   patterns. Apart from evenly sampled data, we will consider missing data
   as well as arbitrary nonuniformly sampled data, at the same time. We
   will demonstrate via simulation results the superiority of our proposed
   algorithms in terms of resolution, sidelobe suppression and
   applicability to signals with arbitrary sampling patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Microwave air-lifted inductors with high quality factor are presented
   with the Cylindrical Radial Superlattice (CRS) structure utilized as the
   low-loss conductor. The superlattice structure composed of alternating
   nonmagnetic/magnetic layers is used to fabricate low radio frequency
   ohmic-loss inductors. A gold wire bond is used as the structural core
   while electroplated copper/permalloy (Ni80Fe20) with 400nm/160nm
   thickness, respectively, is used to realize the superlattice structure.
   Also, an ultra-wide band high Q-factor inductor and its implementation
   is demonstrated. The simulation and measurement results prove the
   effectiveness of employing CRS structure to get high performance low
   loss passive devices.}},

   resonates below the original QMSIW resonance frequency, which further

Abstract = {{The ubiquitous use of RFID tags raises concern about potential security
   risks in RFID systems. Because low-cost tags are extremely
   resource-constrained devices, common security mechanisms adopted in
   resource-rich equipment such as computers are no longer applicable to
   them. Hence, one challenging research topic is to design a lightweight
   cipher that is suitable for low-cost RFID tags. Traditional cryptography
   generally assumes that the two communicating parties are equipotent
   entities. In contrast, there is a large capability gap between readers
   and tags in RFID systems. We observe that the readers, which are much
   more powerful, should take more responsibility in RFID cryptographic
   protocols. In this paper, we make a radical shift from traditional
   cryptography, and design a novel cipher called Pandaka 1, in which most
   workload is pushed to the readers. As a result, Pandaka is particularly
   hardware-efficient for tags. We perform extensive simulations to
   evaluate the effectiveness of Pandaka. In addition, we present security
   analysis of Pandaka facing different attacks.}},

Abstract = {{We provide an improved bound for the expectation of the stationary delay
   under the maximum weight scheduling (MWS) policy in one-hop wireless
   networks. In the model, the interference of the links is characterized
   by an interference graph G = (V, E). For a vector mu is an element of
   R-+(vertical bar V vertical bar), let chi(f)(G, mu) be the weighted
   fractional coloring number for the graph G under the weight vector mu.
   For an arrival rate vector lambda in the capacity region, we define a
   quantity epsilon((lambda)) to be the unique value satisfying the
   condition chi(f)(G, lambda+epsilon((lambda)) e) = 1, where e = (1, 1,
   ... , 1)(T). We show that the stationary delay is upper-bounded by
   B/(2(Sigma(vertical bar V vertical bar)(i=1)
   lambda(i))epsilon((lambda))), where B is a constant depending on the
   arrival process. We show that the new bound is the tightest
   single-parameter bound obtainable with an often-used analytical
   framework. Generalizing the above, we also provide the tightest bounds
   for all MWS-w policies.}},

Abstract = {{The ever increasing traffic demand becomes a serious concern of mobile
   network operators. To solve this traffic explosion problem, there have
   been many efforts to offload the traffic from cellular links to direct
   communications among users. In this paper, we propose the framework of
   Traffic Offloading assisted by Social network services (SNS) via
   opportunistic Sharing in mobile social networks, TOSS, to offload
   SNS-based cellular traffic by user-to-user sharing. First we select a
   subset of users who are to receive the same content as initial seeds
   depending on their content spreading impacts in online SNSs and their
   mobility patterns in offline mobile social networks (MSNs). Then users
   share the content via opportunistic local connectivity (e.g., Bluetooth,
   Wi-Fi Direct, Device-to-device in LTE) with each other. The observation
   of SNS user activities reveals that individual users have distinct
   access patterns, which allows TOSS to exploit the user-dependent access
   delay between the content generation time and each user's access time
   for traffic offloading purposes. We model and analyze the traffic
   offloading and content spreading among users by taking into account
   various options in linking SNS and MSN trace data. The trace-driven
   evaluation demonstrates that TOSS can reduce up to 86.5\% of the
   cellular traffic while satisfying the access delay requirements of all
   users.}},

Abstract = {{Aerogels (AGs) are open-cell nanofoams. AGs are lightweight and possess
   high thermal and acoustic insulation properties. Due to their similar to
   90\% porosity, AGs are very brittle and fragile, which inhibits its use
   for load-bearing applications. For this reason an area of open research
   is the study and improvement of the mechanical properties of aerogels
   without altering their unique properties. Due to the extreme brittleness
   and low applied stress that AGs can support, direct mechanical
   measurements of AGs are challenging. To date very few experiments have
   been carried out to characterize the mechanical properties of aerogels;
   in particular at small contact dimensions and ultralow loads (nN-mu N).
   In this paper, silica aerogel has been studied by nanoindentation using
   a diamond Berkovich indenter. We characterize the elasticity, stiffness,
   and hardness of the material as a function of contact depth (<= 500 nm)
   at ultralow loads. The modulus and hardness are shown to change with
   depth with moduli and hardness ranging from 1523 MPa and 3.5-6.8 MPa,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Implicit boundary method enables the use of background mesh to perform
   finite element analysis while using solid models to represent the
   geometry. This approach has been used in the past to model 2D and 3D
   structures. Thin plate or shell-like structures are more challenging to
   model. In this paper, the implicit boundary method is shown to be
   effective for plate elements modeled using Reissner-Mindlin plate
   theory. This plate element uses a mixed formulation and discrete
   collocation of shear stress field to avoid shear locking. The trial and
   test functions are constructed by utilizing approximate step functions
   such that the boundary conditions are guaranteed to be satisfied. The
   incompatibility of discrete collocation with implicit boundary approach
   is overcome by using irreducible weak form for computing the stiffness
   associated with essential boundary conditions. A family of
   Reissner-Mindlin plate elements is presented and evaluated in this paper
   using several benchmark problems to test their validity and robustness.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional finite element method requires very high density mesh and
   nonlinear analysis to obtain reasonably accurate solutions for elastic
   contact problems. Analytical solutions are available for these problems
   based on Hertz theory of elastic contact. In this paper we show that
   using implicit boundary approach, solutions that are of similar accuracy
   can be obtained without the need for nonlinear analysis. This approach
   is applied here only for tied contacts so that there is no sliding or
   separation. Contacting bodies are modeled as an assembly of parts and a
   separate background mesh is constructed for each part. At the contact,
   elements of the mesh belonging to the contacting parts overlap. A trial
   function is constructed such that the displacements are continuous at
   the contact. The goal is to capture the stresses as accurately as
   possible using sufficiently dense global mesh. Several elastic contact
   problems including classical point and line contact problems are used to
   study the effectiveness of this approach.}},

   metals have been used to create high performance conductors for radio
   frequency (RF) transmission lines and low loss vias in CMOS and through

   delays have been greatly reduced. Two permalloys of Ni80Fe20 and FeCo
   are studied as the ferromagnetic materials with low and high
   magnetization saturation that can be used for designing superlattice
   structures with low and high GHz frequency ranges, respectively. The
   effects of design parameters including the number of layers and
   thickness ratio of the superlattice structures have been studied. Full
   wave simulations have been used to verify them. Finally, a radial
   superlattice structure consisting of Cu/NiFe layers has been implemented
   and its resistance has been compared with the control solid-core devices
   made of copper; proving the effectiveness of the proposed radial
   superlattice structure for reducing the RF loss.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper the flexible Liquid Crystal Polymer (LCP) substrate is
   used to implement broadband wearable/foldable conformal bandpass filters
   that use compact cavity resonators working under the principle of
   quarter mode substrate integrated waveguide (QMSIW), which features a
   75\% size reduction with respect to the conventional substrate
   integrated waveguide (SIW) counterpart. Further size reduction is
   realized with the use of a complementary split ring resonator (CSRR)
   metamaterial unit cell integrated with the QMSIW architecture. The
   resulting CSRR-loaded QMSIW cavity has its main resonance frequency
   below the quasi-TE0.5,0,0.5 resonance mode of the original QMSIW cavity
   due to the evanescent wave amplification phenomenon with CSRR loading. A
   low temperature surface micromachining process on the LCP and mechanical
   drilling of via holes are used for fabrication. The realized CSRR-loaded
   QMSIW cavity features a moderate quality factor (Q) that makes it useful
   for the design of bandpass filters with much broader fractional
   bandwidth (FBW) when compared to those using conventional SIW cavities.
   A 2nd order and a 3rd order surface micromachined Chebyshev BPFs are
   demonstrated for operation at a center frequency of 25.5 GHz. More than
   11\% FBW with an in-band return loss of better than 20 dB and an
   insertion loss of less than 1.5 dB, including transitions, are obtained
   for both filters. Theoretical analysis of the working principle is
   explained. Measured results are in good agreement with the 3D full wave

Abstract = {{This paper presents a modular, extensible, framework for rendering
   images from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data on an array of
   heterogeneous processor architectures. Our design supports real-time
   reconstruction of a two-dimensional image from a matrix of echo pulses
   and their corresponding response values using Backprojection. Key to our
   design is the division of the Backprojection problem into atoms, which
   decomposes Backprojection along both it's input and output data
   dimensions, and allows scheduling algorithms to explicitly minimize
   communication overhead through the deliberate assignment of atoms to
   processors. Performance analysis on a cluster of 10 Tesla C2050 GPUs,
   and 5 Intel Xeon Processor X5650 CPUs has shown speedup that closely
   follows the number of processors in the cluster.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of resource scheduling in real-time
   ensemble systems. An ensemble system uses multiple simple computational
   models (called ``experts{''}) to produce its outputs. Real system
   requirements of ensemble systems (e.g., size, weight, power and cost
   constraints) often lead to limited availability of computational
   resources required to support concurrent execution of all their experts.
   In practical systems, uncertainties in execution time and resource
   utilization complicate even further the scheduling of these experts. We
   propose a fuzzy-logic feedback-based resource scheduler (FuzzyFES) that
   can provide real-time execution of all relevant experts while minimizing
   the impact of limited resources and uncertainties on the system
   performance. FuzzyFES consists of a fuzzy-logic controller (FZ), a task
   utilization adaptor (TUA) and a real-time task scheduler (RTS) working
   harmoniously in a closed loop with an ensemble system to be scheduled.
   By considering the uncertainties that may be present in the systems and
   deployment environments, FZ determines the total allowable CPU
   utilization for the ensemble system. TUA then calculates the amount of
   resource utilization to be allocated to each expert not exceeding the
   total allowable utilization. The assigned utilization from TUA ensures
   that critical experts achieve their best performance while guaranteeing
   minimum execution time needed by others. RTS creates a real-time
   schedule for the experts to execute on multiple processors according to
   the allotted utilization. Our performance evaluation of a case-study
   ensemble system with limited resources demonstrates that FuzzyFES can
   schedule experts to produce outputs closely similar to those of the same
   system with sufficient resources, although the limited-resource system
   has up to 40\% fewer resources. The results also confirm FuzzyFES's
   efficiency and show that execution-time imprecision and occasional
   fluctuation of resource availability can be tolerated by at least 45\%
   more than when the experts are scheduled in an open-loop manner.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we show that the problem of configuring the topology of a
   data center network to optimize data aggregation is NP-hard even when
   the number of aggregators is 1. Further, the approximation ratio of the
   algorithm proposed by Wang, Ng, and Shaikh {[}3] for the case of a
   single aggregator is (k+ 1)/2, where k is the degree of ToR
   (top-of-rack) switches and this algorithm also exhibits an anomalous
   behavior-increase in the switch degree may result in an increase in the
   aggregation time. By comparison, if topology configuration is done using
   the longest processing time (LPT) scheduling rule, the approximation
   ratio is (4/3-1/(3k)). We show that for every instance of the single
   aggregator topology configuration problem, the time required to
   aggregate using the LPT configuration is no more than that using the
   Wang et al. rule. By coupling the LPT rule with the rule of Wang et al.,
   we achieve a better throughput as promised by LPT and at the same time
   reduce the total network traffic. Experimental results show that the LPT
   rule reduces aggregation time by up to 90\% compared to the Wang et al.
   rule. The reduction in aggregation time afforded by a known improvement,
   COMBINE, of LPT relative to Wang et al. is up to 90.5\%. More
   interestingly, when either of the LPT rule or COMBINE is augmented with
   the Wang et al. rule, total network traffic is reduced by up to 90\%
   relative to using LPT and COMBINE with chains.}},

Abstract = {{The puff (or the pollutant puff) represents an instantaneous pollution
   cloud released in the ambient atmosphere. This paper describes, and
   validates a complete dynamic data driven application system (DDDAS) for
   measuring and simulating a puff in a dynamic, urban environment.
   Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are used as mobile sensors to collect
   data from the concentration field which is then assimilated into a
   running advection diffusion simulation to predict the puff motion. In
   turn, the running simulation is used to determine desirable locations to
   place the sensors based on the previously collected data. We directly
   compare the error achieved in a real-time, low resolution simulation by
   using both static and mobile sensors in a the DDDAS. The scenario
   investigated here is analogous to a chemical puff that is released in an
   urban environment and travels downstream according to the advection
   diffusion equation. We find that a single mobile sensor in the DDDAS
   outperforms an array of several static sensors in this scenario.
   Additionally, groups of mobile sensors are able to further decrease the
   error levels in the simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Piezoelectric nanowires (NWs) have recently attracted immense interest
   due to their excellent electro-mechanical coupling behavior that can
   efficiently enable conversion of low-intensity mechanical vibrations for
   powering or augmenting batteries of biomedical devices and portable
   consumer electronics. Specifically, nano-electromechanical systems
   (NEMS) composed of piezoelectric NWs offer an exciting potential for
   energy harvesting applications due to their enhanced flexibility, light
   weight, and compact size. Compared to the bulk form, high aspect ratio
   NWs can exhibit higher deformation to produce an enhanced piezoelectric
   response at a lower stress level. NEMS made of conventional
   semiconducting vertically aligned, ZnO NW arrays have been investigated
   thoroughly for energy harvesting; however, ZnO has a lower piezoelectric
   coupling coefficient as compared to many ferroelectric ceramics which
   limits its piezoelectric performance. Amidst lead-free ferroelectric
   materials, environmentally-friendly barium titanate (BaTiO3) possesses
   one of the highest piezoelectric strain coefficients and thus can enable
   greater energy transfer when used in vibrational energy harvesters. In
   this paper, a novel NEMS energy harvester is fabricated using ultra-long
   (similar to 40 mu m long), vertically aligned BaTiO3 NW arrays which has
   a low resonant frequency (below 200 Hz) and its AC power harvesting
   capacity from low amplitude base vibrations (0.25 g) is demonstrated.
   The design and fabrication of low resonant frequency vibrational energy
   harvesters has been challenging in the field of MEMS/NEMS since the high
   stiffness of the structures results in resonant frequency often greater
   than 1 kHz. However, ambient mechanical vibrations usually exist in the
   1 Hz to 1 kHz range and thus highly complaint ultra-long, NW arrays are
   beneficial to enable efficient energy conversion. Through the use of
   this newly developed synthesis process for the growth of highly
   compliant, ultra-long BaTiO3 NW arrays, it is shown that piezoelectric
   NWs based NEMS energy harvesters capable of harnessing this low
   frequency ambient vibrational energy can be conceived.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional composite materials invented to be used in structures with
   the purpose of high load-bearing with excellent in-plane properties.
   Continuous fiber reinforced composites are one of the mostly used
   categories of advanced composites. This class of composites has gained a
   lot of attention due to their light-weight and decent mechanical
   properties. However, additional material design is required to tune both
   mechanical and structural properties of these composites. Since the load
   transfer between reinforcement phase and polymer matrix happens at the
   interfacial region, a better interphase might result in a composite with
   higher vibration damping. In this study, a gradient interphase between
   carbon fiber and polymer matrix has been created by using ZnO nanowires
   to engineer the damping loss factor of the carbon fiber composites. For
   the growth of ZnO nanowires on the carbon fabric, low temperature
   hydrothermal reaction has been used. Then the carbon fabrics with ZnO
   nanowires were infiltrated with a low viscosity epoxy using vacuum
   assisted resin transfer molding technique. The stiffness and structural
   damping of the composite were examined using dynamic mechanical
   analysis. The results show that the damping properties of hybrid
   composites using ZnO nanowires are enhanced compare to the bare carbon
   fabric composites. Since the growth of ZnO nanowires is a tunable
   process, the length, diameter and aspect ratio of the nanowires and
   consequently the architecture of the interphase can be tailored for the
   desired vibration damping in the system. Thus, the hybrid composites
   with ZnO nanowire interphase can be used to enhance the energy
   dissipation in a structural system.}},

Abstract = {{Highly cross-linked polyurethanes have a high elastic modulus and creep
   resistance, but they undergo a brittle fracture below the glass
   transition temperature. Unfortunately, a large number of glassy
   polyurethanes are prone to brittle fracture without undergoing large
   elastic deformations; in particular, brittle failure is common under
   conditions such as low temperature and high strain rates. While the
   rigidity in polymers is required for practical applications, the lack of
   resistance against crack propagation is essential to avoid catastrophic
   failures. The toughening of polymers is a crucial aspect of improving
   the strength and ductility at specific temperatures and deformation
   rates. One method that has shown promise in recent years is the creation
   of local regions of reduced modulus that absorb strain energy and
   toughen the polymer. For instance, rubbers are typically added to epoxy
   which phase separate upon polymerization and create local elastic
   regions that significantly toughen the polymer.
   In this study, a variety of two-phase transparent polyurethanes in the
   form of single inclusions is designed to study the toughening mechanism
   of the local regions of reduced modulus with an embedded crack.
   Synthesized heterogeneous polyurethanes show a transition from brittle
   to ductile behavior in addition to a drastic increase in the maximum
   load that the polymer can withstand. Compact tension experiments
   demonstrate that a small reduction in the inclusion's Young's modulus
   (similar to 10\%) leads to an increase in the toughness by factor of 7
   (similar to 700\%). Moreover, digital image correlation is performed to
   map the strain distribution around the crack in order to visualize
   possible toughening mechanism. Comparison between the induced strain
   field in samples with inclusion and samples without inclusion reveals an
   efficient toughening mechanism of the polymers.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - Recent educational initiatives by the barna Administration
   have highlighted the need for more racial and ethnic diversity in
   Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields (The
   White House, 2011). While African Americans are underrepresented in
   faculty positions nationally, accounting for only 5.2\% of all academic
   faculty across all disciplines (Harvey, W. B., \& Anderson, E. L.
   (2005). Minorities in higher education: Twenty-first annual status
   report. Washington, DC: American Council on Education), the
   underrepresentation of African Americans in STEM fields such as
   computing science is even more severe. According to a recent Computing
   Research Association (CRA) Taulbee Survey, African Americans represent
   just 1.3\% of all computing sciences faculty (CRA, 2006).
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper examines the benefits of one
   program that specifically seeks to fulfill the barna Administration's
   initiatives by addressing this disparity in higher education.
   Findings - The program helps prepare doctoral students for the academic
   job search process in an effort to increase the ranks of African

Abstract = {{An interface treatment for conjugate heat and mass transfer in the
   lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) method is proposed based on our
   previously proposed second-order accurate Dirichlet and Neumann boundary
   schemes. The continuity of temperature (concentration) and its flux at
   the interface for heat (mass) transfer is intrinsically satisfied
   without iterative computations, and the interfacial temperature
   (concentration) and their fluxes are conveniently obtained from the
   microscopic distribution functions without finite-difference
   calculations. The present treatment takes into account the local
   geometry of the interface so that it can be directly applied to curved
   interface problems such as conjugate heat and mass transfer in porous
   media. For straight interfaces or curved interfaces with no tangential
   gradient, the coupling between the interfacial fluxes along the discrete
   lattice velocity directions is eliminated and thus the proposed
   interface schemes can be greatly simplified. Several numerical tests are
   conducted to verify the applicability and accuracy of the proposed
   conjugate interface treatment, including: (i) steady
   convection-diffusion in a channel containing two different fluids, (ii)
   unsteady convection-diffusion in the channel, and (iii) steady heat
   conduction inside a circular domain with two different solid materials.
   The accuracy and order-of-convergence of the simulated interior
   temperature (concentration) field, the interfacial temperature
   (concentration) and heat (mass) flux are examined in detail and compared
   with those obtained from the ``half lattice division{''} treatment in
   the literature. The present analysis and numerical results show that the
   half lattice division scheme is second-order accurate only when the
   interface is fixed at the center of the lattice links while the present
   treatment preserves second-order accuracy for arbitrary link fractions.
   For curved interfaces, the present treatment yields second-order
   accurate interior and interfacial temperatures (concentrations) and
   first-order accurate interfacial heat (mass) flux. An increase of
   order-of-convergence by one degree is obtained for each of these three
   quantities compared with the half lattice division scheme.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study the optimum heat exchanger inventory allocation to
   maximize the thermal performance of a two-stage vapor compression system
   with two evaporators has been investigated. Both the cooling (A/C) and
   heating (H/P) Carnot and non-Carnot non-isentropic cycles have been
   considered. The optimum operating ranges of cycle parameters that
   maximize both the coefficient of performance (COP) and exergetic
   efficiency (eta(2)) of the cycles for both cooling and heating purposes
   are discussed. The research upon which this paper partly reports covered
   all possible ranges of cycle parameters using the Monte-Carlo method.
   For the Carnot cycle, maximum values of the cooling coefficient of
   performance (COPc), cooling exergetic efficiency (Thic), heating
   coefficient of performance (COPH), and heating exergetic efficiency
   (eta(IIH)) were found to be 9.6, 0.47, 10.7 and 0.87, respectively. The
   low-pressure (LP) thermal load and temperature difference in the
   condenser were found to critically affect both the A/C and H/P
   performance, while the heat conductance ratio and the mass flow rate
   ratio were found to have a pronounced effect on only the H/P
   performance. The best A/C and H/P cycle performance may be achieved by
   having the two evaporators with both the thermal load and mass flow rate
   in the high-pressure loop to be 20\% less than that in the low-pressure
   loop. The analysis performed on the non-Carnot two-compressor,
   two-evaporator A/C and HIP non-isentropic cycles determined both the
   feasible and optimal ranges of variations of the controlling parameters.
   The combined maximum values of the low- and high-pressure evaporator
   thermal loads was found to be 10-15\% lower than the maximum value of
   the condenser heat rejection rate, thus reflecting the relative sizes of
   these units as heat exchangers. Other factors that may help provide
   guidance for utilizing the system for cooling and heating purposes
   include the values of the COPc and COPH, the relative amounts of the
   mass flow rates in the low-pressure and high-pressure loops of the
   cycle, and the values of the low-pressure and high-pressure compressor
   powers.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study on absorption characteristics of water vapor into
   a thin lithium-bromide (LiBr) solution flow is presented. The LiBr
   solution flow is constrained between a superhydrophobic vapor-permeable

   to conventional falling film absorbers, in this configuration, the
   solution film thickness and velocity can be controlled independently to
   enhance the absorption rate. The effects of water vapor pressure and
   cooling surface temperature on the absorption rate are studied. An
   absorption rate of approximately 0.005 kg/m(2)s was measured at a LiBr
   solution channel thickness and flow velocity of 160 mu m and 4 mm/s,
   respectively. The absorption rate increased linearly with the water

   high absorption rate and the inherently compact form of the proposed

Abstract = {{We describe a general technique for resealing the high-diffusivity
   convection diffusion equation (CDE) when it is simulated with the
   lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) method. The macroscopic CDE is
   recovered from the kinetic-based LBE when the mean free path of the
   particles is much smaller than the lattice grid size. As the relaxation
   time and the mean free path are proportional to the diffusion
   coefficient of the CDE in LBE models, direct use of a large diffusion
   coefficient would lead to large numerical errors in LBE simulations. To
   improve accuracy, we rescale the CDE by choosing a large time scale and
   a moderate relaxation coefficient so that the characteristic Fourier
   number for the diffusion process remains the same. The resealed LBE
   model is first validated with two numerical tests for which analytical
   solutions are available: the transient heat conduction in a
   semi-infinite solid and that inside a circle. The comparison between the
   LBE results and analytical solutions shows that the numerical errors are
   greatly reduced when the high diffusion coefficient is resealed down. It
   is then applied in a diffusion-radiation coupled model to simulate the
   energy transport in a high-temperature solar thermochemical reactor for
   hydrogen production. Rescaling of the solar flux boundary conditions and
   the chemical reaction source terms due to the resealing of the diffusion
   coefficient is also discussed and the simulation results will be used to
   optimize the cavity-reactor design.}},

Abstract = {{Rare circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are cancer cells that detached from
   either a primary tumor or metastatic sites. CTCs circulate into
   bloodstream and become the origin of metastasis, the spread of cancer to
   distant organs, which is the primary cause of cancer-induced death. This
   paper describes our development of a microfluidic chip with unique
   micropillar geometry for rapid capture of CTCs from whole blood. The
   microscope-slide-sized microchip contains tens of thousands of
   isotropically-etched elliptical micropillars, which enhanced the
   interactions between cells and chip surfaces. The microchip was coated
   with DNA aptamer, an antibody-like molecule which can specifically bind
   with their target cells. With optimized channel geometry and flow rate,
   the microchip yielded a capture efficiency of >95\% and a purity of
   >81\% when capturing leukemia cells from a cell mixture. Then, the
   device was applied to capture colorectal tumor cells from whole blood;
   as few as 10 tumor cells can be efficiently isolated from 1 mL blood in
   28 min. We envision that this high-performance microchip is promising
   for the detection, enrichment and isolation of rare CTCs, and will open
   up new opportunities for cancer diagnosis and monitoring cancer
   treatment.}},

Abstract = {{The future development of body armor is to develop a lightweight, and
   wearable garment system without a loss of ballistic impact resistance.
   High performance fabrics, such as Kevlar, have been utilized for body
   armor due to their high energy absorption and lightweight
   characteristics. However, additional reinforcement is necessary for
   Kevlar fabric to meet the protection requirements for body armor against
   typical ballistic threats. Thick layers of fabric or embedded ceramic
   plates have been used to meet these requirements at the expense of
   increased weight of the armor and reduced mobility of the user. Thus,
   much research has been conducted on this topic to increase the ballistic
   impact resistance of Kevlar fabrics, mainly focused on the understanding
   and modeling of ballistic impact behavior. Due to the significant effect
   of damage mechanisms on ballistic impact response, these mechanisms
   should vastly be studied to better understand the ballistic impact
   response of Kevlar. When a projectile impacts a woven fabric, the
   imparted energy is dissipated through several damage mechanisms
   including tow pullout, local tow failure at the point of impact, and
   remote tow failure. Among those mechanisms, tow pullout is especially
   critical in the case of a penetrator with a blunt face impacting a
   fabric with non-penetrating velocities and is strongly influenced by
   friction between tows. In this work, we employed a novel method to
   increase the friction between Kevlar tows by synthesizing zinc oxide
   nanowires onto the fabric surface. As a result, vertically-aligned zinc
   oxide nanowires were grown on the fabric surface and tailored to achieve
   an optimum ballistic performance response reaching an enhancement of up
   to 390\% in tow pullout peak load compared to untreated fabrics.
   Additionally, the effect of various surface functionalization processes
   and nanowire morphology is investigated so that an optimum process is
   developed for an efficient ballistic performance response.}},

Abstract = {{Vertically aligned arrays of zinc oxide nanowires can serve as an
   adjustable interface for fiber composites through controllable synthesis
   techniques. When grown on carbon fiber surfaces as a fiber-matrix
   interphase of a composite, ZnO nanowires increase the surface area of
   interaction between fiber and matrix, and thus cause a greater
   interfacial shear strength of the composite. The ability to control the
   interfacial strength of this interphase through tailored morphologies
   enables the design of composite systems to specific applications. This
   report focuses on the controlled growth of ZnO nanowires and correlates
   the relationship between nanowire length and interfacial shear strength
   of the composite. Previous studies have focused on the effects of
   nanowire morphology on the interfacial strength; however, the data was
   limited to nanowire lengths < 1 mu m due to problems with nanowire
   uniformity and cleanliness {[}1]. Here, a new synthesis method is
   applied to the growth of zinc oxide nanowires on carbon fiber that
   enables the production of long, vertically aligned, uniform nanowires
   while maintaining the tensile properties of the fiber. The nanowires
   created by the new method are then compared to previous method nanowires
   by scanning electron microscopy imaging. Lastly, the interfacial shear
   strength of the fiber/polymer matrix composite is tested using single
   fiber fragmentation and correlated to the nanowire length of each
   method.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the physics of water desorption from a lithium
   bromide (LiBr) solution film. The study was conducted on a
   membrane-based desorber in which the solution flows through an array of
   microchannels capped by a porous membrane. The membrane allows the vapor
   to exit the flow and retains the liquid. The solution film velocity and
   thickness as well as the solution and vapor pressures are independently
   controlled. Effects of different parameters such as wall temperature,
   solution and vapor pressures, solution flow velocity, and the solution
   inlet temperature on desorption rate were studied. Two different
   mechanisms of desorption are observed and analyzed. These mechanisms
   consisted of: (1) direct diffusion of water molecules out of the
   solution and their subsequent flow through the membrane and (2)
   formation of water vapor bubbles within the solution and their exit
   through the membrane. Direct diffusion was the dominant desorption mode
   at low surface temperatures and its magnitude was directly related to
   the vapor pressure, the solution concentration, and the heated wall
   temperature. Desorption at the boiling regime was predominantly
   controlled by the solution flow pressure. Overall, an order of magnitude
   higher desorption rate compare to a previous study on a membrane-based
   desorber was achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Two-phase passive heat carriers/spreaders are effective thermal
   management tools. However, their thermal performance is limited due to

   better wick structures are being developed. Advancements in the design
   of these structures have been hampered by a lack of models that can

   array to achieve maximum liquid permeability at a given hydrostatic
   pressure. Two wicking devices with different pillar spacings were
   fabricated. The maximum heat transfer capacities of the devices at

   a point where conventional forms of thermal management are no longer
   sufficient. In this paper; Digitized Heat Transfer (DHT) is examined as
   one of the proposed solutions for high heat flux thermal management.
   Nusselt number is used to quantify the heat transfer capabilities of the
   flow while Re, Pr, x / H, and droplet aspect ratio are identified as the
   relevant nondimensional parameters that influence the shape and
   magnitude of Nu throughout a heated channel. With the intention of
   providing a single curve to represent the heat transfer in any digitized
   flow, a scaling constant, f(2), for Nu at axial distances greater than
   one circulation length is found. This scaling is combined with a
   previously identified scaling constant for the first circulation length
   using an inverse tangent weighting function. The two different scalings
   are applied to the Nu curve for heat transfer to a digitized flow and
   the result is a single curve that can approximately predict Nu at any
   axial position if the flow parameters are known. From the fitting
   functions identified, it is found that extremely long droplets will
   exhibit higher steady state Nu that is at least three times greater than
   the Nu value of the equivalent continuous flow.}},

Abstract = {{To fully model the physics present within the proposed supercritical
   water reactor (SCWR), the thermal hydraulics calculations (yielding
   temperatures and densities in each material as a function of space) must
   be coupled to the neutronic calculations (yielding reactivity and
   neutron flux shapes). To enable this full coupling, a 3D model of a
   supercritical water reactor is being implemented in the CFD software
   OpenFOAM with the same geometry as a 3D MCNP (neutronics) model.
   Coupling will performed through result exchange between the two codes
   densities and temperatures from OpenFOAM to MCNP, with heat generation
   returned from the neutronics calculations. Use of a reduced-geometry
   model is advisable due to the high computational cost of each
   OpenFOAM/MCNP coupling iteration. In the present work, a 1.5D thermal
   model of a single fuel pin was coupled with a 3D MCNP model. The thermal
   model includes single channel analysis (cladding/coolant heat transfer)
   as well as heat transfer within the cladding, helium gas gap, and
   uranium dioxide fuel itself These heat transfer zones provide specific
   data points of the radial temperature profile. Because no radial mesh is
   considered, full radial dependence is not possible. The model provides
   limited radial dependence unlike what a 1D code could provide; thus,
   I.5D is used to indicate the incomplete radial dependence that is
   included in the model. Iteration between the two codes is performed
   until heat generation is converged to within 10\% between successful
   MCNP results. A discussion of these 3D/1.5D coupled results and the path
   forward to fully 3D coupling is provided.}},

Abstract = {{The past twenty years has seen the explosion of the ``shape zoo{''}:
   myriad shape representations, each with pros and cons. Of the varied
   denizens, distance transforms and density function shape representations
   have proven to be the most utile. Distance transforms inherit the
   numerous geometric advantages of implicit curve representations while
   density functions are unmatched in their approach to the modeling of
   uncertainty and noise in shape features. We have not seen much
   rapprochement between these two representations in general. In this
   work, we introduce a complex wave representation (CWR) of shape which
   has the ability to simultaneously carry probabilistic information via
   its magnitude and geometric information via its phase, achieving an
   integration of distance transforms and density function shape
   representations. The CWR is a parametric representation with cluster
   centers akin to a mixture model and curve normal information akin to
   signed distance functions. We demonstrate the perceptual gains of the
   CWR, highlight the advantages of the probabilistic aspect for noisy
   shape alignment by a likelihood approach, and fusing both aspects we
   show that the CWR leads to a feature space in which kernel PCA yields
   approximate closed curves and probability density functions.}},

Abstract = {{A robust hyperspectral unmixing algorithm that finds multiple sets of
   endmembers is introduced. The algorithm, called Robust Context Dependent
   Spectral Unmixing (RCDSU), combines the advantages of context dependent
   unmixing and robust clustering. RCDSU adapts the unmixing to different
   regions, or contexts, of the spectral space. It combines fuzzy and
   possibilistic clustering and linear unmixing to learn multiple contexts
   and the optimal endmembers and abundances for each context. RCDSU uses
   fuzzy membership functions to partition the data, and possibilistic
   membership functions to identify noise and outliers. An extension of
   RCDSU to deal with the case of an unknown number of contexts is also
   proposed. The performance of the proposed work is evaluated using
   simulated and real hyperspectral data. The experiments show that the
   proposed methods can handle noisy data and identify an ``optimal{''}
   number of contexts and appropriate endmembers within each context.}},

   and its catalytic activity toward species is key to enhancing the
   science of catalysis. The current state of knowledge on

   we correlate the activity of a bilayer Pt-Ru catalyst to its surface
   composition. By using electrochemical techniques such as Cyclic
   Voltammetry (CV) and Copper Underpotential Deposition (Cu-UPD) in

Abstract = {{In this study we have developed a unique method for synthesizing very
   reactive water splitting materials that will remain stable at
   temperatures as high as 1450 degrees C to efficiently produce clean
   hydrogen from concentrated solar energy. The hydrogen production for a
   laboratory scale reactor using a ``Thermo-mechanical Stabilized Porous
   Structure{''} (TSPS) is experimentally investigated for oxidation and
   thermal reduction temperatures of 1200 and 1450 degrees C, respectively.
   The stability and reactivity of a 10 g TSPS over many consecutive
   oxidation and thermal reduction cycles for different particle size
   ranges has been investigated. The novel thermomechanical stabilization
   exploits sintering and controls the geometry of the matrix of particles
   inside the structure in a favorable manner so that the chemical
   reactivity of the structure remains intact. The experimental results
   demonstrate that this structure yields peak hydrogen production rates of
   1-2 cm(3)/(min.g(Fe3O4)) during the oxidation step at 1200 degrees C and
   the 30 minute thermal reduction step at 1450 degrees C without
   noticeable degradation over many consecutive cycles. The hydrogen
   production rate is one of the highest yet reported in the open
   literature for thermochemical looping processes using thermal reduction.
   This novel process has strong potential for developing an enabling
   technology for efficient and commercially viable solar fuel production.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a simplified model of corona discharge for the
   finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) computations has been applied to
   analysis of transient voltages across insulators of a transmission line
   for direct lightning strikes to an upper phase conductor. In the
   simulation, three 40-m towers, separated by 300 m, with one overhead
   ground wire and three phase conductors are employed. Corona is assumed
   to occur only on the upper phase conductor struck by lightning. The
   progression of corona streamers from the conductor is represented as the
   radial expansion of cylindrical conducting region around the conductor.
   The reduction of insulator-voltage peak due to the corona is significant
   only for the upper phase conductor. For a 10-kA peak current, the
   upper-phase-conductor voltage peaks are reduced by 26\% and 21\% for a
   positive stroke with 1-mu s-and 3-mu s-risetime currents, respectively,
   and those for negative-stroke case are reduced by 20\% and 15\%,
   respectively. For a 20-kA peak current, the corresponding
   upper-phase-voltage peaks are reduced by 32\% and 25\% for
   positive-stroke case, and those for negative-stroke case are reduced by
   26\% and 20\%.}},

   similar height-dependent attenuation tendency (decrease in light
   intensity peak amplitude and increase in rise time) in their upward
   propagation. While in their downward propagation, although 10 out of 11
   return strokes decreased their light intensity amplitudes, only 3 out of
   11 return strokes have exhibited an increased rise time. The attenuation
   within the lowest tens of meters of the lightning channel tends to be
   much stronger than that over the remaining propagation.}},

Abstract = {{Electromagnetic computation methods (ECMs) have been widely used in
   analyzing lightning electromagnetic pulses (LEMPs) and lightning-caused
   surges in various systems. One of the advantages of ECMs, in comparison
   with circuit simulation methods, is that they allow a self-consistent
   full-wave solution for both the transient current distribution in a 3D
   conductor system and resultant electromagnetic fields, although they are
   computationally expensive. Among ECMs, the finite-difference time-domain
   (FDTD) method for solving Maxwell's equations has been most frequently
   used in LEMP and surge simulations. In this paper, we review
   applications of the FDTD method to LEMP and surge simulations, including
   (i) lightning electromagnetic fields at close and far distances; (ii)
   lightning surges on overhead power transmission line conductors and
   towers, (iii) lightning surges on overhead distribution and
   telecommunication lines; (iv) lightning electromagnetic environment in
   power substations; (v) lightning surges in wind-turbine-generator
   towers; (vi) lightning surges in photovoltaic (PV) arrays; (vii)
   lightning electromagnetic environment in electric vehicles (EVs); (viii)
   lightning electromagnetic environment in airborne vehicles; (ix)
   lightning surges and electromagnetic environment in buildings; and (x)
   surges on grounding electrodes.}},

Abstract = {{We present an update on the characteristics of positive flashes recorded
   on the Santis Tower in Switzerland from May 2010 to January 2013, during
   which period 38 positive flashes were recorded. Out of the 38 recorded
   flashes, 1 was identified as a normal downward flash, 5 were classified
   as type-1 flashes (characterized by a large unipolar impulse) and the
   rest of the flashes (32) were classified as type-2 flashes
   (characterized by a slow waveform with superimposed pulse train). We
   present a summary of the characteristics of the lightning current
   parameters for type-1 and type-2 flashes separately and for both types
   combined. We also present a comparison between the present results
   corresponding to type-1 flashes and Berger et al.'s data for flashes
   with large impulsive currents. A similar comparison is presented between
   type-2 flashes in this study and Berger et al.'s data for flashes
   without large impulsive currents. In the latter comparison, the most
   significant differences between the two datasets are in the peak current
   and the amount of transferred charge, both of which are substantially
   larger in our type-2 flash dataset. We finally present a discussion of
   the oscillatory pulse trains in type-2 flashes. Our data are found to
   be, in general, consistent with those observed at the Gaisberg tower.
   However, the overall leader pulse duration and the individual pulse
   duration observed at Santis are higher than their counterparts at
   Gaisberg.}},

Abstract = {{An unusual natural lightning flash containing two negative strokes to

   Florida, on June 8, 2013. The flash was apparently a bolt-from-the-blue,
   whose first-stroke leader emerged from the side of the cloud at a height
   of about 3.5 km above ground level. The first leader showed profuse
   branching and what appears to be corona-like formations with spatial
   extent of 100 to 200 m (probably an intensified portion of radial corona
   sheath) at the upper part of the channel. Leader branching process
   facilitated by two simultaneous space stems was observed. The
   corresponding step lengths were estimated to be 14 and 15 m. The
   first-stroke attachment process involved a streamer zone about 50 m in
   length. Second-stroke leader was also branched. One of the second-leader
   branches appeared to abruptly change its direction at the beginning of
   return stroke process.}},

Abstract = {{The first stroke leader in a cloud-to-ground lightning discharge is
   thought to be preceded by the initial or preliminary breakdown process
   which produces a train of relatively large microsecond-scale electric
   field pulses. In addition to producing the information used to geolocate
   various types of lightning events (cloud-to-ground return strokes,
   M-components, ICC pulses, and cloud lightning pulses) and report their
   parameters such as estimated peak currents, and field waveform
   characteristics such as risetimes and peak-to-zero times, the sensors in
   the U.S. National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) can record the
   magnetic field waveforms of lightning events. This makes them a valuable
   tool in studying the phenomenology and physics of lightning discharges.
   In this study, we use multiple-station measurements of preliminary
   breakdown pulse trains obtained using NLDN sensors at various distances
   from the lightning event. Assuming that the preliminary breakdown pulse
   train in a negative cloud-to-ground discharge is generated when a
   negatively-charged channel extends downward from the main negative
   charge region and interacts with the lower positive charge region, we
   use a modified transmission line model to reproduce the bipolar pulse
   train electric-field signature associated with preliminary breakdown.
   The model-predicted waveforms are compared with those measured at
   different distances by the NLDN sensors.}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneous and configurable multicore systems provide hardware
   specialization to meet disparate application hardware requirements.
   However, effective multicore system specialization can require a priori
   knowledge of the applications, application profiling information, and/or
   dynamic hardware tuning to schedule and execute applications on the most
   energy efficient cores. Furthermore, even though highly disparate core
   heterogeneity and/or highly configurable parameters with numerous
   potential parameter values result in more fine-grained specialization
   and higher energy savings potential, these large design spaces are
   challenging to efficiently explore. To address these challenges, we
   propose a novel configuration-subsetted heterogeneous and configurable
   multicore system, wherein each core offers a small subset of the design
   space, and propose a novel scheduling and tuning (SaT) algorithm to
   efficiently exploit the energy savings potential of this system. Our
   proposed architecture and algorithm require no a priori application

   reveal energy savings potential and insights on energy tradeoffs in

Abstract = {{Configurable caches can significantly reduce energy consumption by
   adapting the system's cache configuration to the applications' specific
   requirements to meet system design and optimization goals. However,
   large configuration design spaces require prohibitive design space
   exploration time (e.g., due to lengthy design space analyses,
   simulations, and/or evaluations) to determine the best configuration
   given these requirements and goals. To significantly reduce design space
   exploration time, we evaluate a design space subsetting method that
   removes energy-redundant configurations (i.e., configurations that
   provide similar energy savings as other configurations), thus
   significantly reducing the design space while still providing
   high-quality, energy-saving configurations. Prior work verified design
   space subsetting's efficacy, however, prior work required extensive
   design-time effort and complete a priori knowledge of the system's
   anticipated applications. In this work, we alleviate these limitations
   and significantly broaden the usability of design space subsetting.
   Results show that complete a priori knowledge of the anticipated
   applications is not necessary, and only a small set of applications
   representative of the anticipated applications' general domains (or
   applications with similar requirements) is sufficient to provide energy
   savings within 5.6\% of the complete, unsubsetted design space.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years the Mission Design Center (MDC) at NASA Ames Research
   Center has been studying mission concepts involving clusters of small
   spacecraft capable of providing cost-effective solutions in orbit
   compared to space missions involving only a single larger spacecraft.
   Low-cost networks of small spacecraft can be a viable alternative to
   large budget Earth observation or space exploration missions producing
   significant scientific return for often moderate development efforts and
   short lead times. This paper is the first in a series of 3 companion
   papers in which we make the point that the scientific value (and hence
   the cost effectiveness) of small multi-spacecraft missions can be
   further increased if the network of spacecraft is allowed to be
   heterogeneous. We define Heterogeneous Spacecraft Networks (HSNs) to be
   networks of spacecraft having different operators or originating from
   different missions that are able to communicate with each other in a
   low-cost manner and with low impact on overall system resources. HSN
   incorporates both the space segment and ground segment for an end-to-end
   solution. In this contribution we illustrate the strength of the HSN
   approach by presenting a general concept for a HSN in LEO as well as a
   case study showcasing the value of such a network. In particular, we
   present a case study where we examine the feasibility of a low-cost,
   multi-institutional network of small spacecraft acting as a
   next-generation Earth Observation (EO) platform and focusing on ad-hoc
   data relay to maximize throughput. In the simulation we show that the
   downlink throughput of an HSN can be larger by an order of magnitude
   compared to the conventional scenario where no networking capability
   exists. Other benefits of using a HSN as a next-generation increment of
   existing capabilities include increased revisit frequencies as well as
   the ability to collect correlated data simultaneously from distributed
   locations around the globe using either conventional or fractionated
   spacecraft. We list key performance requirements for a HSN in order to
   produce a desirable scientific return and present a concept of
   operations (ConOps) for the practical implementation. In the ConOps we
   discuss the required performance of the inter-satellite and
   space-to-ground links and give an overview of the associated ground
   station network. We give an overview of the network management
   techniques required to operate and control the network on a day-to-day
   basis and address the issues of network configuration, network discovery
   and security, as well as fault and performance management. The paper
   ends with an outlook on the paradigm shift HSNs may introduce in the
   domain of space operations. We also list a number of promising
   applications making use of the strength of the concept.}},

Abstract = {{Due to harsh and inaccessible operating environments, space computing
   presents many unique challenges with respect to stringent power,
   reliability, and programmability constraints that limit on-board
   processing performance and mission capabilities. However, the increasing
   need for real-time sensor and autonomous processing, coupled with
   limited communication bandwidth with ground stations, are increasing the
   demand for high-performance, on-board computing for next-generation
   space missions. Since currently available radiation-hardened space
   processors cannot satisfy this growing demand, research into various
   processor architectures is required to ensure that potential new space
   processors are based on architectures that will best meet the computing
   needs of space missions. To enable this research, we present a novel
   framework to analyze potential processor architectures for space
   computing. By using this framework to analyze a wide range of existing
   radiation-hardened and emerging commercial processors, tradeoffs between
   potential space computing architectures can be determined and considered
   when designing new space processors or when selecting commercial
   architectures for radiation hardening and use in space missions. We
   demonstrate the ability of the framework to generate data for various
   architectures in terms of performance and power, and analyze this data
   for initial insights into the effects of processor architectures on
   space mission capabilities. The framework provides a foundation for the
   analysis of a broad and diverse set of processor architectures for
   potential use in next-generation, on-board space computing.}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneous Spacecraft Networks (HSNs) are network environments in
   which spacecraft from different missions and institutions can
   communicate with each other at low cost and with low impact on overall
   system resources. The Mission Design Center (MDC) at NASA Ames Research
   Center has been studying solutions for low cost multi-spacecraft systems
   for a number of years. One may now build on the idea to interconnect
   clusters of spacecraft with each other to have them act as mobile nodes
   belonging to the same collaborative mission. Recent progress in small
   satellite technology is significant, and one of the advantages of small
   satellites lies precisely in the large quantity of spacecraft that can
   be produced at accessible costs. It follows naturally that small
   satellites are an interesting candidate platform for development and
   demonstration of the HSN concept. This paper is the second in a series
   of three companion papers. The general concept of operations for HSNs in
   LEO and a number of future applications are proposed in the first paper
   {[}6], while enabling technology such as devices and lower layer
   protocols are discussed in paper three {[}7]. In this paper, we pick up
   the scenario of a low-cost and multi-institutional network of Earth
   Observation (EO) missions in LEO and conduct network performance
   analysis using the AGI System Tool Kit (STK) and the open-source Network
   Simulator (NS-3). A multi-spacecraft network consolidates the individual
   capabilities of each spacecraft from different institutions by combining
   benefits of both frequent revisit and concentrated observation.
   Complementary and correlated data could be collected simultaneously from
   a large set of distributed spacecraft utilizing HSN capability. In this
   specific configuration, communication distance between spacecraft,
   related delays and error rate are the major factors in network
   performance. Also, average duration of communication opportunities
   between spacecraft is usually very limited. Thus, it is important to
   simulate orbital dynamics, link margins, and protocols simultaneously to
   analyze network performances. In this paper, we compare some existing
   protocols to obtain a measure for the practical performance of the
   candidate network. We focus on best-effort data delivery, an approach
   necessitated by the severe constraints on communications resulting from
   low-cost and low system resource small spacecraft. In the application
   layer, we show that packet size and data rate of a source node also
   affect overall performance of the network. We present the resulting
   figures of merit from our simulations. The paper concludes with a
   summary of the simulation results.}},

Pages = {{105-116}},
Abstract = {{Based on controlled laboratory experiments, we numerically simulate the
   initiation and long-term evolution of back-barrier tidal networks in
   micro-tidal and meso-tidal conditions. The simulated pattern formation
   is comparable to the morphological growth observed in the laboratory,
   which is characterised by relatively rapid initiation and slower
   adjustment towards an equilibrium state. The simulated velocity field is
   in agreement with natural reference systems such as the micro-tidal
   Venice Lagoon and the meso-tidal Wadden Sea. Special attention is given
   to the concept of drainage density, which is measured on the basis of
   the exceedance probability distribution of the unchannelled flow
   lengths. Model results indicate that the exceedance probability
   distribution is characterised by an approximately exponential trend,
   similar to the results of laboratory experiments and observations in
   natural systems. The drainage density increases greatly during the
   initial phase of tidal network development, while it slows down when the
   system approaches equilibrium. Due to the larger tidal prism, the tidal
   basin has a larger drainage density for the meso-tidal condition (after
   the same amount of time) than the micro-tidal case. In both micro-tidal
   and meso-tidal simulations, it is found that there is an initial rapid
   increase of the tidal prism which soon reaches a relatively steady value
   (after approximately 40 yr), while the drainage density adjusts more
   slowly. In agreement with the laboratory experiments, the initial bottom
   perturbations play an important role in determining the morphological
   development and hence the exceedance probability distribution of the
   unchannelled flow lengths. Overall, our study indicates an agreement of
   the geometric characteristics between the numerical and experimental
   tidal networks.}},

Abstract = {{Broad-band infrared (IR) spectroscopy, especially at high spectral
   resolution, is a largely unexplored area for the far IR (FIR) and submm
   wavelength region due to the lack of proper grating technology to
   produce high resolution within the very constrained volume and weight
   required for space mission instruments. High resolution FIR spectroscopy
   is an essential tool to resolve many atomic and molecular lines to
   measure physical and chemical conditions and processes in the
   environments where galaxy, star and planets form. A silicon immersion
   grating (SIG), due to its over three times high dispersion over a
   traditional reflective grating, offers a compact and low cost design of
   new generation IR high resolution spectrographs for space missions. A
   prototype SIG high resolution spectrograph, called Florida IR Silicon
   immersion grating spectromeTer (FIRST), has been developed at UF and was
   commissioned at a 2 meter robotic telescope at Fairborn Observatory in
   Arizona. The SIG with 54.74 degree blaze angle, 16.1 l/mm groove
   density, and 50x86 mm(2) grating area has produced R=50,000 in FIRST.
   The 1.4-1.8 um wavelength region is completely covered in a single
   exposure with a 2kx2k H2RG IR array. The on-sky performance meets the
   science requirements for ground-based high resolution spectroscopy.
   Further studies show that this kind of SIG spectrometer with an airborne
   2m class telescope such as SOFIA can offer highly sensitive spectroscopy
   with R similar to 20,000-30,000 at 20 to 55 microns. Details about the
   on-sky measurement performance of the FIRST prototype SIG spectrometer
   and its predicted performance with the SOFIA 2.4m telescope are
   introduced.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, it is shown that yielding and void evolution in a porous
   metallic material is strongly influenced by the particularities of the
   plastic flow of the matrix. This is demonstrated by comparing the
   effective response of porous solids for which the matrix is described by
   Tresca and von Mises yield criterion, respectively. The effective
   response of the porous solid is calculated analytically using rigorous
   limit analysis theorems and upscaling techniques. Analysis is conducted
   for both tensile and compressive axisymmetric loading scenarios and
   spherical void geometry. For the first time it is demonstrated that if
   the matrix plastic response is governed by Tresca yield criterion, the
   overall response is softer, the combined effects of pressure and the
   third-invariant on yielding being much stronger than in a porous solid
   with von Mises matrix. Furthermore, the rate of void growth or collapse
   is much faster in a porous solid with Tresca matrix.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present two content-adaptive rain and snow removal
   algorithms for single image based on filtering. The first algorithm
   treats rain and snow removal task as an issue of bilateral filtering,

   views the same task from the perspective of guided-image-filtering, and
   the guidance image is derived according to the statistical property of
   raindrops or snowflakes as well as image background content. A
   comparative study and quantitative evaluation with some main existing
   image assessment algorithms demonstrate better performance of our
   proposed algorithms. The main contributions of our works are twofold:
   firstly, to the best of our knowledge, our algorithms are among the
   first to introduce image content information for single-image-based rain
   and snow removal; and secondly, we are also among the first to introduce
   quantitative assessment for single-image-based rain and snow removal

Abstract = {{Bridge detection in panchromatic imagery is of great importance in
   civilian and military applications. Popular algorithms for bridge
   detection are often based on a priori knowledge to bridge structure or
   location features, where manually-introduced decision rules are
   incorporated into a complex algorithm in spatial domain. Instead of
   knowledge-based approach in spatial domain, in this paper, we proposed a
   fast data-driven algorithm in compressed domain for panchromatic
   satellite imagery. Our algorithm consists of two main steps: firstly,
   bridge region candidates detection with hierarchical saliency model in
   compressed domain; and secondly, bridge region candidates validation
   with Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM).
   Experiments are conduced, and detection results demonstrate the
   effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm. The main
   contributions of our work are twofold: 1) to the best of our knowledge,
   we are among the first to introduce the concept of compressed domain
   techniques for bridge detection; and 2) compared with other
   knowledge-based algorithms, no assumptions are made beforehand for our
   algorithm, which makes it applicable for bridges of various cases.}},

Abstract = {{In complex networked systems, the failures of a few critical components
   will cause a large cascade of component failures because of operational
   dependencies between components, resulting in the breakdown of the
   network. Therefore, it is crucial to identify these critical nodes in
   the study of complex network vulnerability under cascading failure.
   Unfortunately, we show that this problem is NP-hard to be approximated
   within a ratio of O(n(1-epsilon)). Accordingly, we design two approaches
   to solve this problem. The first one estimates the cascading potential
   of each node while the second one measures the cooperated impact of node
   failures under an ordered attack. Since smart-grids is an important
   complex networked infrastructure, we also demonstrate some safety
   setting for power grids using the designed algorithms.}},

   Management Training (GMT), which is a metacognitive intervention, offers

   weekly to 10 biweekly sessions. Participants included six combat
   Veterans who reported multiple blast exposures resulting in symptoms
   consistent with mild TBI. Group analysis showed a significant
   improvement in measures of executive function derived from performance
   on the computerized Tower of London. There were no significant changes
   on self/informant questionnaires of executive function, indicating a
   lack of generalization of improvement from the clinic to everyday
   activities. Overall, while the data indicate efficacy of GMT in the
   rehabilitation of combat Veterans with executive function deficits

Abstract = {{In recent years, permutation entropy is widely used to characterize the
   complexity of EEG time series and can be applied to predict the onset of
   serious brain diseases, such as the epileptic seizure. In many practical
   situations, the number of EEG time series that need to be analyzed
   simultaneously is very large, so the computation of the permutation
   entropy is time-consuming and should be accelerated so that the
   real-time analysis is possible. Noting that mathematical operations can
   be sped up effectively with hardware implementation, we design a
   parallel FPGA platform consisting of 128 reconfigurable pipelines, which
   are used to calculate the permutation entropy for a single EEG time
   series. When the platform works at 150MHz and the embedding dimension is
   5, an average speedup of 5553 for different window sizes is achieved
   compared with C codes running on a 3GHz Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2320 CPU.
   Meanwhile, the hardware cost is very low.}},

Abstract = {{Crash prediction models are useful tools for identifying locations that
   have a higher risk of crashes and for prioritizing projects. The focus
   of this study was on developing macroscopic or planning-level models for
   pedestrian safety. Although such efforts have been undertaken, they have
   generally focused on specific cities or counties with census tracts as
   the unit of the analysis. This study analyzed a larger study area (the
   state of Florida) at a finer spatial resolution (census block groups
   instead of tracts). Four models were developed to determine the crash
   frequency for each census block group. The models were for total
   crashes, severe and fatal crashes, fatal crashes, and nighttime crashes.
   The estimated models captured the effects of several socioeconomic,
   transportation, land use, and contextual variables. The results
   generally reaffirmed past findings about the relationship between
   crashes and socioeconomic, transportation, and land use characteristics.
   However, the models in this study captured relationships at the level of
   census block groups, whereas most past studies reported relationships at
   the level of census tracts. In addition, the models developed in this
   study included the effect of certain variables at multiple spatial
   scales and yielded interesting results. In particular, the variables at
   multiple scales clearly indicated locations with larger volumes of
   conflicting vehicular and pedestrian movements to be of higher risk for
   pedestrian crashes.}},

Abstract = {{To address the uncertainties caused by the penetration of intermittent
   renewable energy, most ISOs/RTOs perform day-ahead and look-ahead
   reliability unit commitment (RUC) runs, ensuring sufficient generation

   Two-stage stochastic optimization models have been studied extensively
   to strengthen the RUC runs, while multi-stage stochastic optimization
   models were barely studied. In this paper, we investigate the unit
   commitment and economic dispatch decision differences generated by these
   two approaches considering the load uncertainties in the system. The
   stochasticity is represented by a set of scenarios for the two-stage
   model and a scenario tree for the multi-stage case.}},

   proposed that calcium phosphate (CaP) is first deposited in the basement
   membrane of the renal tubules and then grows through the renal
   interstitium reaching the papillary surface to form sub-epithelial
   plaque called Randall's plaque (RP). The RP, once exposed to urine in
   the renal pelvis, becomes coated with calcium oxalate (CaOx) to form a
   stone. This work is the initial foray into determining the influence of
   a negatively charged polymer upon the formation of calcium oxalate.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of the new 2010 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM 2010)
   procedure that predicts free-flow speed by using posted speed limit and
   eight additional variables was evaluated. The eight additional variables
   were the proportion of segment length with restrictive median, the
   proportion of segment with curb on the right-hand side, the number of
   access point approaches on the right side in the subject direction of
   travel, the number of access point approaches on the right side in the
   opposing direction of travel, the segment length, the width of the
   signalized intersection, the number of through lanes, and the distance
   between intersections. Multiday speed data from 104 Florida urban street
   segments with a speed limit ranging from 25 to 55 mph were used in the
   study. Field mean free-flow speed was determined for each analysis
   segment as well as the geometric and traffic attributes required by HCM
   2010 to predict free-flow speed. Statistical and graphical analyses
   showed that the HCM 2010 speed prediction methodology had a low
   coefficient of determination and underpredicted free-flow speed when the
   segment posted speed limit was 35 mph or higher. The results further
   showed that the use of free-flow speed (predicted by the HCM 2010
   methodology) in determining arterial level of service produced lower
   levels of service for 10 of the 20 segments analyzed. In addition,
   calibration of the HCM 2010 model coefficients showed that speed
   prediction by this model could be improved if the speed limit
   coefficient were doubled and that the influence of cross section and
   access density factors substantially decreased.}},

Abstract = {{Functional validation is widely acknowledged as a major challenge for
   System-on-Chip (SoC) designs. Directed tests are superior compared to
   random tests since a significantly less number of directed tests can
   achieve the same coverage goal. Existing test generation techniques have
   inherent limitations due to use of formal methods. First, these
   approaches expect formal specification and do not directly support
   Hardware Description Language (HDL) models. Most importantly, the
   complexity of real world designs usually exceeds the capacity of model
   checking tools. In this paper, we propose a scalable technique to enable
   directed test generation for HDL models by combining static analysis and
   simulation based validation. Unlike existing approaches that support a
   limited set of HDL features, our approach covers a wide variety of
   features including dynamic array references. We have compared our
   approach with existing hybrid as well as random test generation
   techniques using various fault models. Our experimental results
   demonstrate that our proposed technique is scalable, and enables
   directed test generation for large designs.}},

   problems that need to be addressed during the system level design. In
   this paper, we explore the DVS scheduling problem on multicore systems
   under both temperature and energy constraints. We present an exact
   algorithm as well as a polynomial time approximation scheme, since this
   problem is NP-hard. When the original problem is schedulable, our
   approximation algorithm is guaranteed to generate a solution, which will
   not violate the temperature constraint, and consume no more time or
   energy than a specified approximation bound, e.g., within 1\%, of the
   optimal time consumption and energy constraints. We evaluate our
   approach using both real and synthetic benchmarks mapped on DVS capable
   multicore processors. The experimental results demonstrate that our
   technique is able to produce schedules close to the optimal solution

Abstract = {{This paper presents a gesture recognition framework designed for
   controlling mobile robots using dynamic hand gestures. The system is
   unique in that it can be trained to recognize a new gesture by simply
   demonstrating the gesture once. From then on, the system improves its
   recognition accuracy over time by learning from experience. The
   classification scheme utilizes a nearest neighbor approach with a
   dynamic time warping distance metric. The approach robustly handles both
   temporal and spatial variations in executions of highly dynamic and
   complex gestures. One product of the research is an open source software
   package that will work with little to no modifications on robots
   utilizing a 3D depth sensor and the Robot Operating System (ROS).
   Experimental results show the ability of novice users to train and
   utilize the system effectively, as well as the system's ability to
   increase its recognition accuracy over time by learning from experience.}},

Abstract = {{A global localization method for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs)
   based on background flow velocity map prediction is proposed. Background
   flow velocity maps with time stamps are assumed to be predicted by a
   regional ocean model with certain accuracy and these maps are preloaded
   onto vehicles. Vehicles measure (estimate) general absolute flow
   velocities at their locations through local sensing. Particle filters
   are implemented to estimate AUVs' locations by comparing local flow
   velocity measurements with flow velocity prediction. The proposed
   algorithm is path independent and is suitable for any non-uniform vector
   fields. Convergence of localization error is achieved in simulation
   tests in a time dependent benchmark flow field, namely the double-gyre
   flow field. A two-dimensional vector field interpolation scheme based on
   irregularly-spaced data points is implemented to estimate theoretical
   flow velocities at vehicles' locations. It is shown that interpolation
   error can be treated as low-level map noise, which has limited impact on
   convergence. Localization error converges in simulation tests with
   different levels of map noise, which we believe to be dominant in
   practice comparing to measurement noise and vehicle control noise.}},

Abstract = {{Considerable evidence suggests that the lateral line system serves an
   important role in fish-like locomotion by providing hydrodynamic
   information about the surrounding fluid. In this paper, a fish-like
   locomotion model is developed in an ideal fluid with a background flow
   estimation algorithm inspired by the lateral line system. Specifically,
   the fish model is geometrically formulated with the Joukowski
   transformation and is dynamically defined as a deformable solid body.
   Describing the fluid-body interactions is a hydrodynamic model that
   incorporates the potential flow theory with a shedding mechanism of
   discrete vortices. With the hydrodynamic information on the boundary of
   the fish-like profile, the background flow field can be estimated with a
   modified vortex panel method. Base on the estimation, the control
   decision can potentially be adjusted accordingly, which may improve the
   swimming performance. Furthermore, in the profile model, body segments
   are defined such that the internal forces can be easily obtained for
   quantitative efficiency evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{Piezoelectric materials exhibit electromechanical coupling which has led
   to their widespread application for sensors, actuators, and energy
   harvesters. These materials possess anisotropic behavior with the shear
   coefficient have the largest electromechanical coupling coefficient.
   However the shear mode is difficult to measure with existing techniques
   and thus has not been fully capitalized upon in recent devices. Better
   understanding of the full shear response with respect to the driving
   electric field would significantly help the design of optimized
   piezoelectric shear devices. Here a simple and low cost direct
   measurement method based on digital image correlation is developed to
   characterize the shear response of piezoelectric materials and its
   nonlinear behavior as a function of external field. The piezoelectric
   shear coefficient (d(15)) of a commercial shear plate actuator is
   investigated in both bipolar and unipolar electric fields. Two different
   nonlinearities and hysteresis behaviors of the actuators were observed,
   and the relation between the driving field amplitude and the
   corresponding 413 coefficient is determined. Moreover, the measured
   transverse displacement of the plate actuator in simple shear condition
   is validated through a laser interferometry technique.}},

Abstract = {{Leveraging of flexibility in certain types of electric loads such as
   water heaters, washers, dryers, heating and air conditioning, and
   electric vehicles, offers an attractive and promising approach for large
   scale penetration of renewable generation and peak demand reduction. In
   price/market based approaches, consumers of flexible loads optimize
   their consumption schedules to meet their energy/power demands while
   minimizing their total costs. However, it may be that not all consumers
   will optimize their consumption schedules. We call such consumers
   ``irrational consumers{''} and use the phrase ``rational consumers{''}
   for those who optimize their consumption schedules. In this paper, we
   analyze the impact of irrational consumers on rational consumers in a
   stylized supply-demand balancing problem. We derive a condition which
   characterizes when the optimal utility derived by a rational consumer is
   lower than the case when all consumers act rationally. This condition
   uses parameters of the utility functions of consumers and the total
   consumption of the irrational consumers. The result offers some
   interesting insights into this phenomenon.}},

   approaching a predetermined target from a desired region to minimize
   detection, and then simultaneously converging at the target. Only a
   subset of agents is informed of the bearing to the target and the
   desired common arrival time; other agents only rely on local
   communication with neighboring agents for coordination. A balanced
   containment control is achieved that restricts the motion of the group
   within a desired region (i.e., a circular sector) while evenly spacing
   the agents' orientations. To enable simultaneous arrival, a consensus
   algorithm is designed for agents to coordinate their arrival time by
   achieving consensus with the informed agents. Only local feedback (i.e.,
   orientation information and estimated arrival time) from neighboring
   agents is used to navigate the group, and no position information
   (either absolute or relative position between agents) is required,
   allowing the multi-agent system to operate in a GPS denied area.
   Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the developed

Abstract = {{An inferential sensor based on state estimation techniques is proposed
   for measuring the methanol concentration in an open-cathode direct
   methanol fuel cell. The strategies considered include full-state and
   reduced-state Luenberger observers along with a proportional-integral
   observer. The estimators are designed using linear dynamics derived from
   a comprehensive nonlinear dynamic model of an experimental open-cathode
   direct methanol fuel cell. A representative simulation study is used to
   assess the performance of the estimation schemes deployed on both the
   linear and nonlinear dynamic models of the system. All three estimation
   methods are initially tuned to deliver adequate performance on the
   linear model. The simulation results show that the proportional-integral
   state observer outperforms the other designs when the dynamics are
   driven away from the linear regime. It is argued that the additional
   robustness of the proposed proportional-integral observer design holds
   significant promise for use as the basis for developing an effective
   inferential methanol composition sensor.}},

Abstract = {{Localization of teams of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) still
   remains as a challenge in large-scale ocean currents. In this study,
   moving references, drifting under the influence of the ocean background
   flow, were employed in order to improve the cooperative localization
   (CL) performance of an AUV swarm in harsh ocean flows. More capable AUVs
   (dubbed as mother AUVs) with less localization error were utilized as
   moving references for improving localization error of less capable AUVs
   (called daughter AUVs). Limitations of a previously proposed modified
   extended Kalman filter (MEKF) were identified. A particle filter (PF)
   based algorithm was proposed to address those issues. The performance of
   the PF algorithm was compared with the MEKF algorithm in several
   simulated examples including CL in an N -vortex background flow field.
   Both algorithms can effectively avoid the diverging behavior of
   localization error in pure CL. The PF algorithm is more robust in
   choosing the better localized AUV. With a large number of particles, the
   PF algorithm outperforms the MEKF algorithm at the expense of
   computational efforts.}},

   yields ultimately bounded tracking of a desired trajectory in the

Abstract = {{The Model-Based Networked Control System (MB-NCS) framework can be used
   to improve performance in applications where communication rates are
   limited. This framework has been studied for linear systems with state
   feedback, but little has been done for the nonlinear case or for the
   output feedback case. This paper approaches the problem of networking
   discrete-time nonlinear systems in the MB-NCS framework by using
   dissipativity theory and output feedback measurements. By combining the
   MB-NCS approach and aperiodic event-triggered updates, the NCS may
   operate open loop for long time intervals. Additionally, this paper
   considers model uncertainties and non-vanishing input disturbances as
   these factors can be destabilizing in the absence of continuous
   feedback. While these issues can be mitigated, traditional notions of
   stability are simply not achievable. The main contribution of this paper
   is a boundedness result on the system output with a constructive bound.
   The bound is guaranteed despite the presence of aperiodic updates, model
   uncertainties, and input disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{Electrical stimulation to manipulate the central nervous system (CNS)
   has been applied as early as the 1750s to produce visual sensations of
   light. Deep brain stimulation (DBS), cochlear implants, visual
   prosthetics, and functional electrical stimulation (FES) are being
   applied in the clinic to treat a wide array of neurological diseases,
   disorders, and injuries. This review describes the history of electrical
   stimulation of the CNS microenvironment; recent advances in electrical
   stimulation of the CNS, including DBS to treat essential tremor,
   Parkinson's disease, and depression; FES for the treatment of spinal
   cord injuries; and alternative electrical devices to restore vision and
   hearing via neuroprosthetics (retinal and cochlear implants). It also
   discusses the role of electrical cues during development and following
   injury and, importantly, manipulation of these endogenous cues to
   support regeneration of neural tissue.}},

Abstract = {{From the context of a contemporary understanding of the phenomenological
   origins of friction and wear of materials, we review insightful
   contributions from recent experimental investigations of three classes
   of materials that exhibit uniquely contrasting tribological behaviors:
   metals, polymers, and ionic solids. We focus on the past decade of
   research by the community to better understand the correlations between
   environment parameters, materials properties, and tribological behavior
   in systems of increasingly greater complexity utilizing novel synthesis
   and in situ experimental techniques. In addition to such review, and a
   half-century after seminal publications on the subject, we present
   recently acquired evidence linking anisotropy in friction response with
   anisotropy in wear behavior of crystalline ionic solids as a function of
   crystallographic orientation. Although the tribological behaviors of
   metals, polymers, and ionic solids differ widely, it is increasingly
   more evident that the mechanistic origins (such as fatigue, corrosion,
   abrasion, and adhesion) are essentially the same. However, we hope to
   present a clear and compelling argument favoring the prominent and
   irreplaceable role of in situ experimental techniques as a bridge
   between fundamental atomistic and molecular processes and emergent
   behaviors governing tribological contacts.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to evaluate the in-situ serviceability
   of cellulose fiber reinforced concrete (CFRC) pipes using Acoustic
   Emission (AE). Three-edge-bearing test was conducted on CFRC pipes in
   the laboratory in accordance with ASTM C497-05. Pipes were saturated in
   water for various periods of time to simulate the practical field
   situations of CFRC pipes with different service life exposed to moisture
   effects. AE sensors and LVDT were installed on pipes detect the damage
   phases during loading. Both monotonic and cyclic loading modes were
   conducted on the CFRC pipes. Results showed that the CFRC pipes
   generally exhibited the nonlinear load-displacement behavior before
   failure, yet the level of ductility was reduced with longer exposure to
   moisture condition. AE data were evaluated through two feature signals,
   that is, intensity analysis and calm ratio analysis. Results showed that
   AE can detect the onset of damage and the ultimate failure of CFRC
   pipes. Additionally, the analysis on CFRC pipes subjected to various
   moisture effects showed different features of AE results. It is found
   that intensity analysis can distinguish different periods of exposure to
   moisture and levels of ductility, which make it feasible to monitor the
   health of CFRC pipes under moisture effects.}},

Abstract = {{The study reported here involved the development and evaluation of
   laboratory conditioning methods and testing protocols to consider heat
   oxidation and moisture that would simulate more effectively asphalt
   mixture aging in the field and thereby help to assess asphalt mixture
   property changes properly over time. In this study, ``aging{''} was
   defined as any detrimental effect on asphalt mixture properties during
   the pavement life. Three laboratory conditioning procedures were
   identified and further developed to evaluate the effects of heat
   oxidation and moisture: heat oxidation conditioning (HOC), cyclic pore
   pressure conditioning (CPPC), and a combination of HOC and CPPC. Cores
   from aged field pavements were used in the energy ratio approach, which
   could integrate various factors that affected cracking performance,
   including key mixture properties and pavement structure, to evaluate the
   effectiveness of the conditioning procedures. HOC was accomplished with
   the Superpave (R) long-term oven aging (LTOA) procedure, and CPPC was
   employed to induce moisture damage to the asphalt mixtures. Results
   indicated that asphalt mixtures subjected only to oxidative aging did
   not exhibit drops in mixture fracture energy (FE) comparable to the
   level observed in the field. The inclusion of CPPC was able to induce
   additional damage effectively through simulation of long-term moisture
   intrusion and repeated internal water pressure under traffic load.
   Further, the combination of LTOA followed by CPPC led to the most
   relevant changes in fracture properties with a level of reduction in FE
   consistent with field observation.}},

Abstract = {{A reflective practicum is a low-pressure, low-risk learning environment.
   In a reflective practicum a learner is educated in a professional
   practice and how to use reflection in the setting of that professional
   practice. An example of a low-pressure and low-risk learning environment
   is the use of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) in medicine to
   provide training for interviewing and diagnostic skills. However, such
   ECA experiences have not been used to teach how to use reflection in the
   setting of a professional practice. In this paper we present a framework
   that supports explicit reflective learning for ECA experiences. Using
   this framework, ECA experiences become a reflective practicum.
   This framework was applied to an ECA experience called the Neurological
   Examination Rehearsal Virtual Environment (NERVE), and created a sample
   experience called the NERVE Reflective Practicum (NERVE-RP). We
   conducted a user study in which second-year medical students (n = 76)
   used NERVE-RP and engaged in reflection based on the experience. The
   results of the user study show that students engage in valuable
   reflections during the experience including instances of critical
   reflection.}},

Abstract = {{Therapeutic delivery of cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent
   stem cells (hPSC-CMs) represents a novel clinical approach to regenerate
   the injured myocardium. However, poor survival and contractility of
   these cells are a significant bottleneck to their clinical use. To
   better understand the role of cell-cell communication in enhancing the
   phenotype and contractile properties of hPSC-CMs, we developed a
   three-dimensional (3D) hydrogel composed of hPSC-CMs, human pluripotent
   stem cell-derived endothelial cells (hPSC-ECs), and/or human amniotic
   mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs). The objective of this study was to
   examine the role of multi-cellular interactions among hPSC-ECs and
   hAMSCs on the survival and long-term contractile phenotype of hPSC-CMs
   in a 3D hydrogel. Quantification of spontaneous contractility of
   hPSC-CMs in tri-culture demonstrated a 6-fold increase in the area of
   contractile motion after 6 weeks with characteristic rhythmic
   contraction frequency, when compared to hPSC-CMs alone (P < 0.05). This
   finding was supported by a statistically significant increase in cardiac
   troponin T protein expression in the tri-culture hydrogel construct at 6
   weeks, when compared to hPSC-CMs alone (P < 0.001). The sustained
   hPSC-CM survival and contractility in tri-culture was associated with a
   significant upregulation in the gene expression of L-type Ca2+ ion
   channel, Cav1.2, and the inward-rectifier potassium channel, Kir2.1 (P <
   0.05), suggesting a role of ion channels in mediating these processes.
   These findings demonstrate that multi-cellular interactions modulate
   hPSC-CM phenotype, function, and survival, and they will have important
   implications in engineering cardiac tissues for treatment of
   cardiovascular diseases.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, using ZrO2 and Ca(NO3)center dot 4H(2)O as raw materials,
   we prepared a series of calica stabilized zirconia (CSZ) ceramics by
   pressureless sintering method. The results show that the relative
   densities of all sintered samples are above 90\%, and the sintered
   samples are composed of cubic, tetragonal and monoclinic ZrO2, and the
   main phase is cubic ZrO2 and tetragonal ZrO2. The content of cubic phase
   increases with the increase of sintering temperature and adding CaO
   content. The grain size of the sintered samples is relatively uniform
   and some pores exist. Increasing the additive amount of CaO, the
   conductivity first rises and then decreases, and the conductivity value
   of the sample containing 5wt\% CaO is the maximum. When the sintering
   temperature is up to 1600 degrees C, the conductivity of the sample
   containing 5wt\% CaO is up to 0.016S.cm(-1) at 800. Furthermore, the
   conductivity of sintered samples is increasing with the increase of test
   temperature according to the Arrhenius equation.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) hold great promise in the pursuit of
   reliable and cheap renewable energy. In this work, tin-doped indium
   oxide (ITO)-TiO2 core-shell nanostructures are used as the photoanode
   for DSSCs. High-density, vertically aligned ITO nanowires are grown via
   a thermal evaporation method and TiO2 is coated on nanowire surfaces via
   TiCl 4 treatment. It is found that high TiO2 annealing temperatures
   increase the crystallinity of TiO2 shell and suppress electron
   recombination in the core-shell nanostructures. High annealing
   temperatures also decrease dye loading. The highest efficiency of 3.39\%
   is achieved at a TiO2 annealing temperature of 500 degrees C. When HfO2
   blocking layers are inserted between the core and shell of the nanowire,
   device efficiency is further increased to 5.83\%, which is attributed to
   further suppression of electron recombination from ITO to the
   electrolyte. Open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements show that
   the electron lifetime increases bymore than an order of magnitude upon
   HfO2 insertion. ITO-TiO2 core-shell nanostructures with HfO2 blocking
   layers are promising photoanodes for DSSCs.}},

Abstract = {{It is well documented that performance of asphalt mixture is related to
   aggregate structure. The Dominant Aggregate Size Range-Interstitial
   Component (DASR-IC) model provides a framework of gradation-based
   parameters and associated criteria to link gradation characteristics and
   volumetric properties to aggregate structure, mixture properties, and
   field performance. Primary interlocking of coarser aggregate is
   characterized by DASR parameters, which have been used to establish
   performance-based criteria based on extensive field rutting data.
   Studies have also shown that mixtures with acceptable DASR criteria may
   result in acceptable cracking performance, indicating that IC
   characteristics strongly influence fracture resistance. Therefore, IC
   parameters have been used to establish and evaluate preliminary criteria
   for optimal cracking performance based on limited data. This paper
   presents the basis and early results for the evaluation and, if
   necessary, modification of IC criteria, through an extensive laboratory
   experiment. The challenge was to realistically isolate the effects of
   the IC, given that all DASR-IC components are interrelated. The results
   to date indicate that IC parameters have a strong effect on damage rate
   and fracture energy in a manner consistent with expected trends.}},

Abstract = {{Cold recycling is one of the most employed rehabilitation techniques for
   asphalt pavements and it is becoming more and more important as the
   reduction of emissions becomes a priority in the reduction of the
   greenhouse effect. The main advantages of asphalt cold recycling
   techniques are the use of reclaimed materials and the lack of need to
   heat the aggregates to make the mixtures: these possibilities allow for
   reduced consumption of natural aggregates and emissions providing, at
   the same time, many technical and economical benefits. The reduction of
   emissions in the use of reclaimed materials is due to a reduction of
   transport, in particular that reduction is bigger when the reclaimed
   materials are used in place. Nevertheless, the so-called cold in place
   recycling has challenges to control the water content in the mixtures
   and of quickly achieving a sufficient bearing capacity to allow the
   completion of the re-paving work. Generally the solution is provided by
   the use of active fillers, mainly Portland cement, able to absorb water
   and stiffen the mixtures. Sometimes the in place working conditions make
   necessary (presence of clay soils) or suggest (high moisture content)
   the addition of lime, but its effect on cold mixtures performances is,
   at the moment, not completely understood.
   In an effort to improve on-site performance of recycled mixtures, the
   authors developed an extensive research programme aimed to investigate
   the effects provided by the introduction of lime in cold recycled
   mixtures as active filler. The basic idea was to analyse the bearing
   performance of pavement layers made with bituminous emulsion cold
   recycled mixes with different blends of active fillers (cement, lime).
   This paper evaluates the short term bearing capacity of recycled
   mixtures: assessment provided are based on results of deflectometric
   tests carried out on a trial section specifically built in Italy, close
   to Florence. Tests have been undertaken using LWD (Lightweight
   Deflectometer) and FWD (Falling Weight Deflectometer) immediately after
   compaction and after 24 hours of curing. The obtained results, even
   though they need to be confirmed by the analyses of long-term behaviour,
   positively support the use of lime as an active filler.}},

Abstract = {{The paper considers several optimization problem statements for sparse
   signal reconstruction problems. We tested the performance of AORDA
   portfolio safeguard (PSG) package with different problem formulations.
   We solved several medium-size test problems with cardinality functions:
   (a) minimize L1-error of regression subject to a constraint on
   cardinality of the solution vector; (b) minimize cardinality of the
   solution vector subject to a constraint on L1-error of regression. We
   compared performance of PSG and IBM CPLEX solvers on these problems.
   Although cardinality formulations are very appealing because of the
   direct control of the number of nonzero variables, large problems are
   beyond the reach of the tested commercial solvers. Step-down from the
   cardinality formulations is the formulation with the constraint on the
   sum of absolute values of the solution vector. This constraint is a
   relaxation of the cardinality constraint. Medium and large problems
   (from SPARCO toolbox for testing sparse reconstruction algorithms) were
   solved with PSG in the following formulation: minimize L1-error subject
   to a constraint on the sum of absolute values of the solution vector.
   The further step-down in the sparse reconstruction problem formulations
   is the LASSO approach which does not have any constraints on functions.
   With the LASSO approach you do not know in advance the cardinality of
   the solution vector and you solve many problems with different
   regularization parameters. Then you select a solution with appropriate
   regression error and cardinality. Definitely, it is a time-consuming
   process, but an advantage of LASSO approach is that optimization
   problems can be solved quite quickly even for very large problems. We
   have solved with PSG several medium and large problems from the SPARCO
   toolbox in LASSO formulation (minimize L2-error plus the weighted sum of
   absolute values of the solution vector).}},

   rainfall-runoff treatment benefits. These benefits are a result of such
   permeable systems providing hydraulic conveyance and filtration of
   particulate matter (PM) transported by runoff. With respect to
   hydrology, these systems reintroduce infiltration, evaporation, and
   storage phenomena; with respect to traffic and road safety, the systems
   increase skid resistance in wet conditions, reduce hydroplaning, and
   reduce splash-and-spray phenomena; with respect to runoff treatment, the
   systems function as a filter for PM and PM-bound constituents. These
   phenomena and the models therefore are a function of the hydrodynamics
   (which are not necessarily laminar) in the porous medium and conunonly
   are characterized by the hydraulic conductivity of the porous medium.
   The measured hydraulic conductivity (permeability) was examined in 12
   common porous asphalt mixes. A Darcian model for hydraulic conductivity
   in the laminar flow regime was examined, as commonly done for PPs and
   PFCs. However, hydrodynamic regimes in porous asphalt that extended
   beyond laminar flow during testing were identified for these porous
   mixes. Therefore, the variability of the hydraulic conductivity as a
   function of applied hydraulic head in a hydrodynamic regime (based on
   the Reynolds number) was measured and modeled. From these results, a
   saturated seepage model was developed; it is valid for laminar and
   transitional regimes. Implications for the application of standardized
   permeameter testing of such porous mix designs are reported.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of online dynamic channel accessing in multi-hop
   cognitive radio networks. Previous works on online dynamic channel
   accessing mainly focus on single-hop networks that assume complete
   conflicts among all secondary users. In the multi-hop multi-channel
   network settings studied here, there is more general competition among
   different communication pairs. A simple application of models for
   single-hop case to multi-hop case with N nodes and M channels leads to
   exponential time/space complexity O(M-N), and poor theoretical guarantee
   on throughput performance. We thus novelly formulate the problem as a
   linearly combinatorial multi-armed bandits (MAB) problem that involves a
   maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) problem with unknown weights. To
   efficiently address the problem, we propose a distributed channel access
   algorithm that can achieve 1/rho of the optimum averaged throughput
   where each node has communication complexity O(r(2) + D) and space
   complexity O(m) in the learning process, and time complexity O(Dm(rho
   r)) in strategy decision process for an arbitrary wireless network. Here
   rho = 1 + epsilon is the approximation ratio to MWIS for a local r-hop
   network with m < N nodes, and D is the number of mini-rounds inside each
   round of strategy decision.}},

Abstract = {{There is increasing pressure for more efficient production of
   agricultural commodities. To this end, cropping systems models are
   useful tools for identifying efficient production practices and
   understanding complex relationships between management, system drivers,
   production, and environmental consequences. In this research, the
   Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer Cropping Systems
   Model (DSSAT-CSM) was amended to allow for water-limited simulation
   under cultural practices common for intensive vegetable production,
   including drip irrigation under plastic-mulched raised beds. A
   two-dimensional water balance model was developed with an emphasis on
   creating a practical model with flexible input requirements and
   reasonable computation time. Model outputs were evaluated against lab
   and field measurements to assess the model's ability to simulate soil
   water dynamics under drip irrigation regimens. Evaluation of a parameter
   estimation method designed to utilize the standard DSSAT soil inputs
   indicated that the method provided unbiased characterization of soil
   water retention curves ( SWRC), with an overall root mean square error (
   RMSE) of 0.0458 cm(3) cm(-3). However, SWRCs were more accurately
   characterized when estimated from soil water measurements from a wider
   range of soil water potentials, with an overall RMSE of 0.0277 cm(3)
   cm(-3). Thus, detailed measurement of soil hydraulic properties was
   recommended to improve parameter estimation and simulation of soil water
   dynamics. Evaluation of soil water simulations against field-measured
   values demonstrated the model's ability to adequately simulate soil
   water flow patterns under drip irrigation for a fairly uniform soil
   under typical vegetable production management practices, with overall
   RMSE values of 0.0257 to 0.0378 cm(3) cm(-3) and 0.0245 to 0.0254 cm(3)
   cm(-3) using the simplified and the more detailed parameter estimation
   methods, respectively.}},

Title = {{Determination of Required Insulation for Preventing Early-Age Cracking
   in Mass Concrete Footings}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2441}},
Pages = {{91-97}},
Abstract = {{One of the methods for controlling the heat of hydration of mass
   concrete structures is to insulate the poured concrete. Currently, no
   method can provide adequate insulation to prevent early-age cracking for
   mass concrete footings. This study developed a method for determining
   the required insulation for rectangular footings. The study included
   isothermal calorimetry testing of cementitious materials, field
   monitoring of temperature in footings, and finite element modeling. A
   fully insulated bridge pier footing constructed in the field in Florida
   was monitored for temperature development and for assessing the
   efficiency of the insulation used. A parametric study consisting of 63
   finite element analyses was conducted on three footing shape cubic
   footing, 4:4:1 footing (length width depth ratio of 4:4:1), and 4:2:1
   footing (length width depth ratio of 4:2:1) to determine the required
   insulation for footings with a volume-to-surface area ratio ranging from
   1.1 to 13.1 ft. The obtained results suggest that the Styrofoam
   insulation used for the specific monitored footing might be excessive;
   therefore, the actual insulation thickness of 2 in. should be reduced to
   1 in. to reduce the construction cost. In general, with a
   volume-to-surface area ratio of less than 4.0 ft, under the same
   insulation condition and with the same concrete mix, larger footings
   require a greater thickness of insulation. However, with a
   volume-to-surface area ratio of 4.0 ft or greater, larger footings only
   require a similar thickness of insulation to prevent cracking. The
   developed method for determining the required insulation for footings
   presented in this paper would be a practice ready for implementing in
   the field.}},

Abstract = {{Neurovascular coupling in epilepsy is poorly understood, the study of
   which requires simultaneous monitoring of hemodynamic changes and neural
   activity in the brain. Here we for the first time present a combined
   real-time 3D Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) and electro-physiology (EEG)
   system for the study of neurovascular coupling in epilepsy, whose
   ability was demonstrated with a pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) induced
   generalized seizure model in rats. Two groups of experiments were
   carried out with different wavelengths to detect the changes of
   oxy-hemoglobin (HbO(2)) and deoxy-hemoglobin (Hbr) signals in the rat
   brain. We extracted the average PAT signals of the superior sagittal
   sinus (SSS), and compared them with the EEG signal. Results showed that
   the seizure process can be divided into three stages. A `dip' lasting
   for 1-2 minutes in the first stage and the following hyperfusion in the
   second stage were observed. The oxy-hemoglobin (HbO(2)) signal and the
   deoxy-hemoglobin (Hbr) signal were generally negatively correlated.
   Compared to other existing functional neuroimaging tools, the proposed
   method here enables reliable tracking of hemodynamic signal with both
   high spatial and temporal resolution in 3D, so it's more suitable for
   neurovascular coupling study of epilepsy.}},

Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1779-1814}},
Abstract = {{We present a novel accelerated primal-dual (APD) method for solving a
   class of deterministic and stochastic saddle point problems (SPPs). The
   basic idea of this algorithm is to incorporate a multistep acceleration
   scheme into the primal-dual method without smoothing the objective
   function. For deterministic SPP, the APD method achieves the same
   optimal rate of convergence as Nesterov's smoothing technique. Our
   stochastic APD method exhibits an optimal rate of convergence for
   stochastic SPP not only in terms of its dependence on the number of the
   iteration, but also on a variety of problem parameters. To the best of
   our knowledge, this is the first time that such an optimal algorithm has
   been developed for stochastic SPP in the literature. Furthermore, for
   both deterministic and stochastic SPP, the developed APD algorithms can
   deal with the situation when the feasible region is unbounded, as long
   as a saddle point exists. In the unbounded case, we incorporate the
   modified termination criterion introduced by Monteiro and Svaiter in
   solving an SPP posed as a monotone inclusion, and demonstrate that the
   rate of convergence of the APD method depends on the distance from the
   initial point to the set of optimal solutions. Some preliminary
   numerical results of the APD method for solving both deterministic and
   stochastic SPPs are also included.}},

Abstract = {{As molecular profiling data continue to accumulate, the design of
   integrative computational analyses that can provide insights into the
   dynamic aspects of cancer progression becomes feasible. Here, we present
   a novel computational method for the construction of cancer progression
   models based on the analysis of static tumor samples. We demonstrate the
   reliability of the method with simulated data, and describe the
   application to breast cancer data. Our findings support a linear,
   branching model for breast cancer progression. An interactive model
   facilitates the identification of key molecular events in the advance of

Abstract = {{Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to study the degradation
   behavior of thin multilayer stacks; Si3N4/Ag/Si3N4. Measurements were
   carried out in 0.5 M Na2SO4 adjusted at pH 10. The impedance data
   collected at the open circuit potential were analyzed with a physical
   model where all elements are clearly defined. The results suggest a
   constant phase element behavior at the electrolyte dielectric interface
   assigned to an in-depth distribution of local resistivity through the
   dielectric layer induced by the electrolyte penetration. To explain the
   electrochemical behavior of the thin silver layer, a localized corrosion
   in a delaminated zone between the upper dielectric and the silver layers
   was adopted. The localized corrosion was found to be related to the
   granular structure of the silver layer in which pores are formed between
   the grains of silver. This model is equivalent to a recently developed
   double porosity or pore-in-pore model. (C) 2014 The Electrochemical

Abstract = {{Chemotherapy combining gene therapy may offer new opportunities in the
   cancer treatments, so co-delivery of drugs and genes become more and
   more popular. Among these reports, greatest advantage is the
   comprehensive effects of genes and drugs. However, it is rarely reports
   that gene transfection and antitumor effect are promoted simultaneously.
   In this work, the hyperbranched glycoconjugated polymer is modified with
   the chlorambucil (CHB) and its chemical structures are well analyzed by
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), H-1 nuclear magnetic
   resonance (NMR) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The biophysical
   properties are assessed by transmission electron microscope (TEM) and
   agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE). Confocal laser scanning microscope
   (CLSM) and flow cytometry have verified the cell internalization between
   the carriers and cells. In vitro drug release shows that the drug can
   slowly release from carrier. Antitumor effect of covalent drug is better
   than the CHB because the polycations can efficient transport drug into
   the nucleus. Owning to the hydrophobic modification and CHB controlled
   released from polycations, grafted polymers show high transfection
   efficiency than hyperbranched glycoconjugated polymers. All profiles
   demonstrate that a controlled release carrier of drug can promote gene
   transfection and antitumor effect, giving a new expectation for the best
   comprehensive treatment of cancer patients.}},

Abstract = {{A new kernel adaptive filtering (KAF) algorithm, namely the sparse
   kernel recursive least squares (SKRLS), is derived by adding a l(1)-norm
   penalty on the center coefficients to the least squares (LS) cost (i.e.
   the sum of the squared errors). In each iteration, the center
   coefficients are updated by a fixed-point sub-iteration. Compared with
   the original KRLS algorithm, the proposed algorithm can produce a much
   sparser network, in which many coefficients are negligibly small. A much
   more compact structure can thus be achieved by pruning these negligible
   centers. Simulation results show that the SKRLS performs very well,
   yielding a very sparse network while preserving a desirable performance.}},

Abstract = {{Forage-based livestock systems are complex, and interactions among
   animals, plants and the environment exist at several levels of
   complexity, which can be evaluated using computer modelling. Despite the
   importance of grasslands for livestock production in Brazil, tools to
   assist producers to make decisions in forage-livestock systems are
   scarce. The objective of this research was to use the CROPGRO-Perennial
   Forage model to simulate the irrigated and rainfed growth of Marandu
   palisade grass (Brachiaria brizantha (A. Rich.) Stapf. cv. Marandu), the
   most widely grown forage in Brazil, by using parameters previously
   calibrated for the tall-growing cv. Xaraes of the same species, under
   non-limiting water conditions. The model was calibrated for the
   irrigated experiment and then tested against independent data of the
   rainfed experiment. Data used to calibrate the model included forage
   production, plant-part composition, leaf photosynthesis, leaf area
   index, specific leaf area, light interception and plant nitrogen (N)
   concentration from a field experiment conducted during 2011-13 in
   Piracicaba, SP, Brazil. Agronomic and morpho-physiological differences
   between the two grasses, such as maximum leaf photosynthesis, N
   concentration and temperature effect on growth rate, were considered in
   the calibration. Under rainfed conditions, the simulations using the
   Penman-Monteith FAO 56 method gave a more realistic water stress
   response than the Priestley and Taylor method. After model
   parameterisation, the mean simulated herbage yield was 4582 and 5249 kg
   ha(-1) for 28 days and 42 days irrigated, and 4158 and 4735 kg ha(-1)
   for 28 days and 42 days rainfed, respectively. The root-mean-square
   error ranged from 464 to 526 kg ha(-1) and the D-statistic from 0.907 to
   0.962. The simulated/observed ratios ranged from 0.977 to 1.001. These
   results suggest that the CROPGRO-Perennial Forage model can be used to
   simulate growth of Marandu palisade grass adequately under irrigated and
   rainfed conditions.}},

Abstract = {{A reactive fluid dissolving a uniform porous material triggers an
   instability in the dissolution front, leading to spontaneous formation
   of pronounced well-spaced channels in the surrounding rock matrix. The
   concentration field within the dissolving region contains two different
   length scales, upstream (no reaction) and downstream of the front
   position. Previous investigations of the reactive-infiltration
   instability have considered one or other of the scales to be dominant,
   leading to rather different conclusions. Here we describe a more general
   linear stability analysis which includes both length scales
   simultaneously. We show how previous work corresponds to special cases
   of our more general analysis and obtain closed-form solutions for small
   permeability gradients.}},

Abstract = {{Physical anthropomorphic phantoms have been utilized for a variety of

   commercially available products, a methodology was developed to
   accomplish this, and an addition was built to create a 90th percentile
   by weight phantom from an existing 50th percentile model. This
   methodology can easily be used to expand the utility of existing
   anthropomorphic phantoms in order to better represent patients of

Abstract = {{In this study, we have designed an electrochemical biosensor for
   real-time detection of specific biomarkers of bacterial metabolism
   related to meat spoilage (hypoxanthine and xanthine). The selective
   biosensor was developed by assembling a `sandwich' of nanomaterials and
   enzymes on a platinum-iridium electrode (1.6 mm tip diameter). The
   materials deposited on the sensor tip include amorphous platinum
   nanoclusters (i.e. Pt black), reduced graphene oxide, nanoceria, and
   xanthine oxidase. Xanthine oxidase was encapsulated in laponite hydrogel
   and used for the biorecognition of hypoxanthine and xanthine (two
   molecules involved in the rotting of meat by spoilage microorganisms).
   The developed biosensor demonstrated good electrochemical performance
   toward xanthine with sensitivity of 2.14 +/- 1.48 mu A/mM, response time
   of 5.2 +/- 1.5 sec, lower detection limit of 150 +/- 39 nM, and retained
   at least 88\% of its activity after 7 days of continuous use.}},

Title = {{The effect of nanoparticle location and shape on thermal transitions
   observed in hydrated layer-by-layer assemblies}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{40}},
Pages = {{8107-8115}},
Abstract = {{Nanoparticles can have a profound effect on thermal transitions observed
   in polymer nanocomposites. Many layer-by-layer (LbL) assemblies contain
   nanoparticles for added functionality, but the resulting effects of
   nanoparticles on an LbL film's thermal properties are not known.
   Previously, we have shown that a nanoparticle-free LbL film containing
   strong polyelectrolytes, poly(diallyldimethylammonium
   chloride)/poly(styrene sulfonate) (PDAC/PSS), exhibited a single
   reversible thermal transition much like a glass-melt transition. In the
   work presented here, nanoparticles of either spherical (SiO2) or
   platelet (Laponite clay) shape are inserted at varying vertical
   locations throughout PDAC/PSS LbL films. Temperature-controlled quartz
   crystal microbalance (QCM-D) and modulated differential scanning
   calorimetry (MDSC) are applied, for which QCM-D proved to be more
   sensitive to the transition. All Laponite-containing films possess two
   thermal transitions. During growth, Laponite-containing films exhibit
   steady increases in dissipation, which is proposed to arise from
   mechanically decoupled regions separated by the Laponite nanoparticles.
   For SiO2-containing films, three transitions are detectable only when
   the SiO2 nanoparticles are placed in the middle of the film; no
   transitions are observed for SiO2 placed at the bottom or top, perhaps
   because of a weakening of the transition. The lowest transition is close
   in value to that of neat PDAC/PSS LbL films, and was assigned to a
   ``bulk{''} response. The higher transition(s) is attributed to polymer
   chains in an interfacial region near the nanoparticle. We propose that
   nanoparticles restrict segmental mobility, thus elevating the transition
   temperature in the interfacial region.}},

Abstract = {{Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and alumina nanocomposites have been of
   great interest to the tribological community due to the significant
   reduction in wear imparted by filling PTFE with low weight percentages
   of alumina nanofillers. The mechanisms of these three order, four order,
   and sometimes five order of magnitude reductions in wear have been
   commonly explored through evaluation of a transfer film. The present
   article evaluates the tribofilm formed on the wear surface of the
   polymer. PTFE composites with 2, 5, and 8 wt\% alumina fillers were
   tested to evaluate wear of the polymer and how it is affected by the
   tribofilms formed on the wear surface of the polymer. Furthermore, the
   link between a transient ``runin{''} wear period and the formation of
   that tribofilm is observed and discussed. Nanomechanical measurements of
   the tribofilm reveal significant alterations in the mechanical
   properties of the surface films formed during sliding.}},

Abstract = {{Successful neurological rehabilitation depends on accurate diagnosis,
   effective treatment, and quantitative evaluation. Neural coding, a
   technology for interpretation of functional and structural information
   of the nervous system, has contributed to the advancements in
   neuroimaging, brain-machine interface (BMI), and design of training
   devices for rehabilitation purposes. In this review, we summarized the
   latest breakthroughs in neuroimaging from microscale to macroscale
   levels with potential diagnostic applications for rehabilitation. We
   also reviewed the achievements in electrocorticography (ECoG) coding
   with both animal models and human beings for BMI design,
   electromyography (EMG) interpretation for interaction with external
   robotic systems, and robot-assisted quantitative evaluation on the
   progress of rehabilitation programs. Future rehabilitation would be more
   home-based, automatic, and self-served by patients. Further
   investigations and breakthroughs are mainly needed in aspects of
   improving the computational efficiency in neuroimaging and multichannel
   ECoG by selection of localized neuroinformatics, validation of the

Journal = {{CHEMICAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},

Pages = {{4646-4655}},
Abstract = {{A thermally-reversible inimer was used to confirm the controlled growth
   of individual branches during self-condensing vinyl atom transfer
   radical polymerization (ATRP). Segmented hyperbranched polymers were
   synthesized by ATRP of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and a novel inimer that
   contained a thermally labile Diels-Alder linkage between its initiating
   and polymerizable moieties. Three distinct feed ratios of MMA to inimer
   (15 : 1, 30 : 1, and 60 : 1) yielded hyperbranched polymers with
   variable degrees of branching and molecular weights in the range of 120
   000 to 515 000 g mol(-1). The resulting hyperbranched polymers contained
   thermally-reversible branch points that were cleaved quantitatively on
   heating to yield linear polymers with molecular weights that were
   similar to the theoretical values that would be expected based on
   controlled chain growth of individual branches during self-condensing
   vinyl polymerization (SCVP). The cleaved linear polymers contained
   pendant furan and terminal maleimide functionalities that allowed
   reassembly at 50 degrees C to form ``healed{''} hyperbranched polymers.
   The healing efficiency was determined by H-1 NMR spectroscopy, and the
   molecular weights of the repaired hyperbranched polymers were
   characterized by gel permeation chromatography. A segmented
   hyperbranched polymer was employed as a multifunctional macroinitiator
   to prepare an amphiphilic ``hyper-star{''} via chain extension with
   poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate. Assembly of these
   ``hyper-stars{''} into well-defined micelles (similar to 23 nm) in
   neutral water was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and
   dynamic light scattering.}},

Abstract = {{Post-tensioned segmental bridges are common throughout the US; however,
   in recent years, the incidence of tendon failure in bonded
   post-tensioned bridges has raised questions regarding their design,
   construction, and maintenance. These failures have led to the
   investigation of the applicability of using replaceable unbonded tendons
   in segmental construction and new methods for monitoring their
   condition. This paper presents a damage detection algorithm to identify
   strand breakage in unbonded tendons based on the relative variation of
   strains in the anchorage. In unbonded construction, the anchorage
   assembly usually undergoes a severe stress-state condition as the entire
   prestressing force only passes through the deviator and end anchorage
   locations. The strain distribution in the anchorage mechanism,
   therefore, goes through significant changes in response to the breakage
   of an individual wire or an entire strand in a multi-strand arrangement.
   In this way, breakage of a post-tensioning strand can be identified by
   observing a non-uniform variation of the strain field over the anchorage
   region in contrast to a uniform variation of strains due to
   environmental or traffic loading. A reduced scale laboratory experiment
   is performed followed by an extensive finite element simulation to
   conduct a parametric study with wire/strand breakages at different
   locations on multi-strand anchorages commonly used in industry. Based on
   the observed strain variations from simulation, a damage detection model
   is proposed that enables the adoption of an automated monitoring
   strategy to characterize the breakage programmatically.}},

Pages = {{8955-8962}},
Abstract = {{Interfacial sliding speed and contact pressure between the sub-units of
   particulate soft matter assemblies can vary dramatically across systems
   and with dynamic conditions. By extension, frictional interactions
   between particles may play a key role in their assembly, global
   configuration, collective motion, and bulk material properties. For
   example, in tightly packed assemblies of microgels - colloidal
   microspheres made of hydrogel - particle stiffness controls the
   fragility of the glassy state formed by the particles. The interplay
   between particle stiffness and shear stress is likely mediated by
   particle-particle normal forces, highlighting the potential role of
   hydrogel-hydrogel friction. Here we study friction at a twinned
   ``Gemini{''} interface between hydrogels. We construct a lubrication
   curve that spans four orders of magnitude in sliding speed, and find
   qualitatively different behaviour from traditional lubrication of
   engineering material surfaces; fundamentally different types of
   lubrication occur at the hydrogel Gemini interface. We also explore the
   role played by polymer solubility and hydrogel-hydrogel adhesion in
   hydrogel friction. We find that polymer network elasticity, mesh size,
   and single-chain relaxation times can describe friction at the gel-gel
   interface, including a transition between lubrication regimes with
   varying sliding speed.}},

   the Deep Packet Inspection so as to maximize the number of scanned

   applications for malicious attack detection, especially those where
   packet scanning is a must. Accordingly, we prove OIP is NP-complete and

Abstract = {{The effect of cathode structures on the chemical stability of Nafion
   membranes is investigated. Membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) were
   prepared by using Nafion 212 membrane and commercially available carbon
   supported Pt electro-catalysts. The cathode structures were controlled
   by the use of long side chain (LSC) and short side chain (SSC)
   perfluorosulfonic acids (PFSAs) as well as three dispersing solvents for
   the electrode fabrication (a water-isopropanol mixture,
   N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, or glycerol). The membrane durability was
   evaluated by the H-2 crossover current density after a 200-hour open
   circuit voltage accelerated stress test. The MEA with a
   glycerol-processed SSC PFSA-bonded cathode exhibited a 200-fold less H-2
   crossover current density than the MEA with a
   water-isopropanol-processed LSC PFSA-bonded cathodes. The analyzes by
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and microscopy suggest that the
   structural uniformity of cathodes play the most significant role in the
   chemical stability of the Nafion membranes. This study emphasizes the
   importance of cathode structures on the durability of Nafion membranes.

Abstract = {{Server virtualization and workload consolidation enable multiple
   workloads to share a single physical server, resulting in significant
   energy savings and utilization improvements. The shift of physical
   server architectures to NUMA and the increasing popularity of scale-out
   cloud applications undermine workload consolidation efficiency and
   result in overall system degradation. In this work, we characterize the
   consolidation of cloud workloads on NUMA virtualized systems, estimate
   four different sources of architecture overhead, and explore
   optimization opportunities beyond the default NUMA-aware hypervisor
   memory management.
   Motivated by the observed architectural impact on cloud workload
   consolidation performance, we propose three optimization techniques
   incorporating NUMA access overhead into the hypervisor's virtual machine
   memory allocation and page fault handling routines. Among these,
   estimation of the memory zone access overhead serves as a foundation for
   the other two techniques: a NUMA overhead aware buddy allocator and a
   P2M swap FIFO. Cache hit rate, cycle loss due to cache miss, and IPC
   serve as indicators to estimate the access cost of each memory node. Our
   optimized buddy allocator dynamically selects low-overhead memory zones
   and ``proportionally{''} distributes memory pages across target nodes.
   The P2M swap FIFO records recently unused <PFN, MFN> lists for mapping
   exchanges to rebalance memory access pressure within one domain. Our
   real system based evaluations show a 41.19 performance improvement when
   consolidating 16-VMs on a 4-socket server (the proposed allocator
   contributes 22.89 of the performance gain and the P2M swap FIFO accounts
   for the rest). Furthermore, our techniques can cooperate well with other
   methods (i.e. vCPU migration) and scale well when varying VM memory size
   and the number of sockets in a physical host.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the time-varying characteristics of practical
   wireless networks, and propose a joint dynamic rate allocation and
   transmission scheduling optimization scheme for scalable video
   multi-rate multicast based on opportunistic routing (OR) and network
   coding. With OR, the decision of optimal routes for scalable video
   coding (SVC) layered streaming is integrated into the joint optimization
   formulation. The network throughput is also increased by taking
   advantage of the broadcast nature of the wireless shared medium and by
   network coding operations in intermediate nodes. To maximize the overall
   video reception quality among all destinations, the proposed scheme can
   jointly optimize the video reception rate, the associated routes to
   different destinations, and the time fraction scheduling of transmitter
   sets that are concurrently transmitting in the shared wireless medium.
   By using dual decomposition and primal-dual update approach, we develop
   a cross-layer algorithm in a fully distributed manner. Simulation
   results demonstrate significant network multicast throughput improvement
   and adaptation to dynamic network changes relative to existing
   optimization schemes.}},

Abstract = {{It is often taught that exposure to liquid nitrogen will cause frostbite
   or more severe damage to exposed skin tissue. However, it is also
   demonstrated that a full hand can be briefly immersed in liquid nitrogen
   without damage. To better understand and possibly visualize the effects
   of human tissue exposure to liquid nitrogen, a series of tests were
   conducted using simulated hands and arms composed of molded gelatin
   forms. The simulated hands and arms were immersed, sprayed, or splashed
   with liquid nitrogen both with and without state of the art personal
   protective equipment. Thermocouples were located within the test
   articles to allow for thermal mapping during the freezing process. The
   study is aimed to help understand frostbite hazards and the time
   constants involved with the handling of liquid nitrogen to improve
   future safety protocols for the safe handling of cryogenic fluids.
   Results of the testing also show the limits to handling liquid nitrogen
   while using various means of protection.}},

Abstract = {{Thyroid hormones (THs) have long been known to have regulatory roles in
   the differentiation and maturation of vertebrate embryos, beginning with
   the knowledge that hormones of maternal origin are essential for human
   fetal central nervous and respiratory system development. Precise
   measurements of circulating THs led to insights into their critically
   important actions throughout vertebrate growth and development,
   initially with amphibian metamorphosis and including embryogenesis in
   fishes. Thyroid cues for larval fish differentiation are enhanced by
   glucocorticoid hormones, which promote deiodinase activity and thereby
   increase the generation of triiodothyronine (T-3) from the less
   bioactive thyroxin (T-4). Glucocorticoids also induce the expression of
   thyroid hormone receptors in some vertebrates. Maternally derived
   thyroid hormones and cortisol are deposited in fish egg yolk and
   accelerate larval organ system differentiation until larvae become
   capable of endogenous endocrine function. Increases in the T-3/T-4 ratio
   during larval development may reflect the regulatory importance of
   maternal thyroid hormones. Experimental applications of individual
   hormones have produced mixed results, but treatments with combinations
   of thyroid and corticoid hormones consistently promote larval fish
   development and improve survival rates. The developmental and survival
   benefits of maternal endocrine provisioning are increased in viviparous
   fishes, in which maternal/larval chemical contact is prolonged.
   Treatments with exogenous thyroid and corticoid hormones consistently
   promote development and reduce mortality rates in larval fishes, with
   potential hatchery-scale applications in aquaculture.}},

Pages = {{10-17}},
Abstract = {{An application of two-dimensional time-domain waveform tomography to map
   the extent of open chimneys at a variable karstic limestone site is
   presented. The seismic surface wave fields were measured next to three
   open chimneys and inverted with a full-waveform inversion technique,
   which was based on a finite-difference solution of two-dimensional
   elastic wave equations and the Gauss Newton inversion method. Both the
   compression wave (P-wave) and shear wave (S-wave) velocities were
   inverted independently and simultaneously to increase the credibility of
   the characterized profiles. The waveform analysis successfully profiled
   embedded low-velocity zones and highly laterally and vertically variable
   limestone. The inverted results are consistent with the known open
   chimneys observed from the ground surface. The Poisson's ratio
   determined from the inverted P-wave and S-wave velocities is consistent
   with soil types: high values of 0.3 to 0.5 for silt and clay and low
   values of 0.1 to 0.2 for limestone. Results show that the full-waveform
   inversion technique is applicable to both shallow and deep foundation
   design in which soil stratigraphy and variability are important. The
   technique is also computationally practical, because the results were
   all achieved in about 3 h of computer time on a standard laptop
   computer.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the oxidation of CO on the Pd5O4 surface oxide and a
   multilayer PdO(101) film on Pd(111) using direct, isothermal rate
   measurements, reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) and
   density functional theory calculations. Our results show that the
   PdO(101) film is intrinsically more reactive than the surface oxide
   toward CO oxidation, and that the reaction kinetics occurs
   autocatalytically on both oxides, with the rate of CO2 production
   increasing as the oxides are reduced. The RAIRS measurements reveal that
   self-accelerating reaction kinetics occurs on PdO(101) because oxide
   reduction generates both oxygen vacancies within PdO(101) domains as
   well as Pd(111) domains. These reduced structures bind CO more strongly
   than the pristine PdO(101) surface, causing the CO surface concentration
   and thus the reaction rate to increase as the oxide is progressively
   reduced by reaction. In contrast, we find that reduction of the surface
   oxide generates only Pd(111) domains which bind CO strongly and sustain
   reaction.}},

Abstract = {{This paper summarizes work towards creating mm-scale power converters
   using high-frequency CMOS as well as MEMS and micro-machined passives.
   Reducing the converter size is largely motivated by creating power
   supplies for micro-robotic platforms (with millimeter and milligram
   scales) without negatively impacting robotic system functionality. MEMS
   power passives are first presented where thin-film piezoelectric
   transformers and resonators are shown as an electromechanical approach
   to achieve ultra-miniature passives at the chip scale. Piezoelectric
   transformers fabricated with thin-film lead zirconate titanate (PZT) on
   silicon are measured and show similar to 60\% efficiencies with 240 and
   75 Omega loads. These transformers have resonant frequencies ranging
   between 14 and 20 MHz. Work towards creating transmission lines
   fabricated with air-core inductors and ferroelectric capacitors is also
   presented. Finally, a fullyintegrated bi-directional converter in CMOS
   is shown driving mm-scale robotic wings made with PZT. The converter's
   maximum efficiency is 77\% at similar to 800 mu W load with 9V output
   and demonstrates >3x voltage boost in 0.13-mu m triple-well CMOS.}},

Abstract = {{Contemporary electronic systems often contain power circuits to support
   the unique power conversion or conditioning needs of each of the various
   subsystems. Each of these power circuits is generally implemented with
   discrete passive and active electronic components soldered next to the
   load devices on the printed circuit board. As greater levels of
   functionality are demanded within diminishing size and weight
   allowances, power management solutions will increasingly demand highly
   miniaturized power converters that are more tightly integrated into
   single-package solutions or even directly integrated onto the points of
   source and load. Experimental converters have demonstrated great
   potential in switching at very high frequencies (100+ MHz) to reduce the
   size of the requisite passive storage elements (inductors, transformers,
   and capacitors) to values that may be suitable for in-package or on-chip
   integration. However, integrating the passives into the same package as
   the active switching and control circuitry remains a significant
   fabrication challenge due to material incompatibility and inadequate
   performance of the passives.
   This paper discusses progress towards a fully integrated power converter
   module with a focus on microfabrication processes for both passive
   component development and wafer-level packaging. The passive components
   have been optimized for high performance at hundreds of MHz through the
   use of thick copper traces, intricate three-dimensional winding
   patterns. The capability of detaching the passives from the fabrication
   wafer produces a passives substrate that can serve directly as a routing
   platform for full integration of all components into a single-package
   solution.}},

Pages = {{1315-1328}},
Abstract = {{One perhaps surprising outcome of E-Commerce has been the emergence of
   speculators who resell products via the web. These speculators create
   retail shortages for popular products (e. g., toys) by removing them
   from store shelves in bulk and then selling them at inflated prices
   through secondary channels; e. g., on sites such as eBay. This article
   examines the impact of such speculation on ordering decisions in a
   two-stage manufacturer-retailer supply chain. The equilibrium results of
   the proposed model demonstrate a range of outcomes: in some cases both
   the retailer and manufacturer benefit from speculators, whereas in other
   cases, both may be hurt by a high number of speculators. The proposed
   model provides insight on when it is best for the manufacturer to take
   measures to preclude a high degree of speculation.}},

Abstract = {{Turbo codes are attractive compared with Low Density Parity Check (LDPC)
   codes for Forward Error Correction (FEC) applications mainly due to
   their superior performance, especially at low Signal-to-Noise Ratio
   (SNR) such as are common in Powerline channels. For example, IEEE
   1901-FFT PHY used the Turbo coding scheme defined in the HomePlug AV
   standards. However, patent fees are usually required for each turbo-code
   enabled manufactured device. The objective of this paper is to examine
   whether unlicensed LDPC codes, with optimized choices of block lengths,
   could be a viable alternative for future Powerline Communications (PLC)
   applications. The paper shows that the performance of the LDPC codes can
   approximate that of the Turbo codes with higher block lengths, on
   channels with typical and realistic PLC characteristics. The paper also
   shows that the additional complexity associated with this increase in
   block length can be mitigated by the use of Quasi-Cyclic LDPC (QC-LDPC)
   codes.}},

Pages = {{65-73}},
Abstract = {{The extensive use of GPS-based travel surveys in the past few years now
   allows vehicle movements to be traced and, thus, data on the actual
   routes chosen for various trips to be collected. However, efforts on the
   empirical modeling of route choices through the use of GPS traces are
   still limited. In this context, the broad focus of this research was to
   combine data from a large-scale GPS-based travel survey and geographic
   information system-based roadway network databases to develop models for
   route choice. Data from GPS streams for 1,913 trips were used in this
   analysis. Three models that considered choice set sizes of five, 10, and
   15 alternatives were built. The estimation results indicated
   statistically significant and intuitively reasonable effects of
   free-flow travel time, left turns, right turns, intersections, and
   circuity on the attractiveness of different route alternatives.
   Furthermore, the sensitivity to these factors was found to vary on the
   basis of trip (purpose, time of day, and day of the week) and traveler
   (gender, age, and length of stay at the current home) characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{It has been observed that during ice, snow, and wind storms, branches
   oriented vertically tend to incur more damage than branches oriented
   horizontally. A study was conducted to determine breaking stress and
   breaking position of branches reoriented nearly horizontal and nearly
   vertical. Branches oriented 40-50 degrees from horizontal with mean
   diameter 4.9 cm (SD +/- 0.73) were removed from two trees and
   transferred to a custom branch pulling station. Branches were reoriented
   either nearly horizontal (76-89 degrees) or vertical (6-29 degrees) to a
   reinforced vertical post. Branches were pulled vertically downward from
   three equidistant positions along the branch until they broke. Failure
   stress for horizontal oriented branches (64 MPa) was double the stress
   required to pull vertical oriented branches to failure (32 MPa). Nine of
   ten horizontal branches failed between the branch base and the pull
   point closest to the base (proximal pull point); whereas seven of ten
   vertical branches failed farther from the base, between the proximal and
   middle pull points. Average length from branch base to failure point for
   horizontal branches was 12.8 cm, and 74.6 cm for vertical branches.
   Despite requiring less stress to break, branch angle change at the
   distal and middle pull points from the original position to the position
   at failure for vertical branches was greater than for horizontal
   branches; whereas angle change at the proximal pull point was greater
   for horizontal branches. Branch taper was not different between
   reorientation treatments. Implications on pruning strategies are
   discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we explore the notion of mobile users' similarity as a key
   enabler of innovative applications hinging on opportunistic mobile
   encounters. In particular, we analyze the performance of known
   similarity metrics, applicable to our problem domain, as well as propose
   a novel temporal-based metric, in an attempt to quantify the inherently
   qualitative notion of similarity. Towards this objective, we first
   introduce generalized profile structures, beyond mere location, that aim
   to capture users interests and prior experiences, in the form of a
   probability distribution. Afterwards, we analyze known and proposed
   similarity metrics for the proposed profile structures using publicly
   available data. Apart from the classic Cosine similarity, we identify a
   distance metric from probability theory, namely Hellinger distance, as a
   strong candidate for quantifying similarity due to the probability
   distribution structure of the proposed profiles. In addition, we
   introduce a novel temporal similarity metric, based on matrix
   vectorization, to capitalize on the richness in the temporal dimension
   and maintain low complexity. Finally, the numerical results unveil a
   number of key insights. First, the temporal metrics yield, on the
   average, lower similarity indices, compared to the non-temporal ones,
   due to incorporating the dynamics in the temporal dimension. Second, the
   Hellinger distance holds great promise for quantifying similarity
   between probability distribution profiles. Third, vectorized metrics
   constitute a low-complexity approach towards temporal similarity on
   resource-limited mobile devices.}},

Title = {{AN ONLINE MANIFOLD LEARNING APPROACH FOR MODEL REDUCTION OF DYNAMICAL
   SYSTEMS}},
Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON NUMERICAL ANALYSIS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1928-1952}},
Abstract = {{This article discusses a newly developed online manifold learning
   method, subspace iteration using reduced models (SIRM), for the
   dimensionality reduction of dynamical systems. This method may be viewed
   as subspace iteration combined with a model reduction procedure.
   Specifically, starting with a test solution, the method solves a reduced
   model to obtain a more precise solution, and it repeats this process
   until sufficient accuracy is achieved. The reduced model is obtained by
   projecting the full model onto a subspace that is spanned by the
   dominant modes of an extended data ensemble. The extended data ensemble
   in this article contains not only the state vectors of some snapshots of
   the approximate solution from the previous iteration but also the
   associated tangent vectors. Therefore, the proposed manifold learning
   method takes advantage of the information of the original dynamical
   system to reduce the dynamics. Moreover, the learning procedure is
   computed in the online stage, as opposed to being computed offline,
   which is used in many projection-based model reduction techniques that
   require prior calculations or experiments. After providing an error
   bound of the classical POD-Galerkin method in terms of the projection
   error and the initial condition error, we prove that the sequence of
   approximate solutions converge to the actual solution of the original
   system as long as the vector field of the full model is locally
   Lipschitz on an open set that contains the solution trajectory. Good
   accuracy of the proposed method has been demonstrated in two numerical
   examples, from a linear advection-diffusion equation to a non-linear
   Burgers equation. In order to save computational cost, the SIRM method
   is extended to a local model reduction approach by partitioning the
   entire time domain into several subintervals and obtaining a series of
   local reduced models of much lower dimensionality. The accuracy and
   efficiency of the local SIRM are shown through the numerical simulation
   of the Navier-Stokes equation in a lid-driven cavity flow problem.}},

Title = {{EVAPOTRANSPIRATION AND CROP COEFFICIENTS FOR SEEPAGE-IRRIGATED
   WATERMELON WITH PLASTIC MULCH IN A SUB-TROPICAL REGION}},
Journal = {{TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE}},

Abstract = {{The crop coefficient (K-c) method is the most widely used method for
   computing crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and relies on selecting a
   representative K-c value for a specific production system, soil, and
   climate. Literature-based (e. g., FAO-56) K-c values, used in the
   absence of local K-c, can lead to erroneous ETc estimates. This error
   becomes considerably high when the standard K-c values from the
   open-field production systems are applied to plastic mulch production
   systems with seepage irrigation that results in shallow water table
   conditions. A three-year study (2003-2005) was conducted with two large
   drainage lysimeters (length = 4.87 m, width = 3.65 m, and depth = 1.37
   m) to quantify ETc and K-c for seepage-irrigated watermelon under
   plastic mulch in sub-tropical Florida. The seasonal ETc varied from 344
   to 422 mm, with an average of 373 mm. The K-c values for initial,
   development, mid-season, and late stages were 0.64, 1.00, 1.28, and
   1.15, respectively, and were statistically higher than the values
   reported in the literature, including FAO-56. The initial K-c especially
   was greater than the literature values due to low plant cover and high
   surface soil moisture in the row-middle areas at the beginning of the
   season resulting from frequent rainfall and shallow water table. To
   adjust K-c for the effect of variable rainfall wetting on evaporation
   during the initial stage, a multivariate regression model (r(2) = 0.74)
   was developed as a function of rainfall and solar radiation. Use of
   literature-based K-c values resulted in underestimation of
   seepage-irrigated ETc by 26\% to 43\%; the 26\% underestimation was from
   a comparison using the same lysimeter setup and seasons but with drip
   (surface) irrigation. Such large differences, not reported earlier,
   highlight the importance of developing local K-c for a specific
   irrigation method, climate, and production system. Regression models
   (r(2) = 0.96) were developed for predicting K-c as functions of time and
   growing degree days. With approximately 65,000 ha of vegetables grown
   under seepage irrigation in Florida, there is a need for developing
   local K-c values for irrigation management and water allocations.
   Scaling up the errors in water use from literature-based K-c values to
   Florida's seepage-irrigated vegetable lands for one season per year
   showed errors of 25 to 42 million m(3) of water. This error accounts for
   15\% to 25\% of annual rainfall and is likely to be much higher for dual
   cropping systems within a year. The extent of errors and related effects
   on watershed water balances highlight the need for similar studies for
   other seepage-irrigated mulched crops.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluated four optical sensor systems in an effort to
   characterize a robust nondestructive technique to estimate tree-specific
   oil palm leaflet nutrient deficiency and aid in determining the required
   fertilizer dosage rates. The four sensor systems used were a handheld
   reflectance sensor (GreenSeeker 505), a chlorophyll meter (SPAD 502
   Plus), a fluorescence sensor (Multiplex 3), and a spectroradiometer
   (FieldSpec 3). Spectral responses were collected using the above sensors
   for leaf samples from 164 randomly selected trees from three commercial
   farms in Malaysia. The spectral data were processed using either
   stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) or rank features techniques
   for feature extraction. The feature datasets were analyzed using support
   vector machine (SVM), soft independent modeling of class analogies
   (SIMCA), and artificial neural network (ANN) classifiers. The SVM and
   ANN classifiers performed better compared to SIMCA for most nutrient
   prediction cases. Overall, with SMLR as a feature extraction technique
   and SVM as a classifier, a spectroradiometer can be used to effectively
   predict N, P, K, Mg, Ca, and B nutrient levels in oil palm leaflets. The
   average overall prediction accuracies for the above conditions were in
   the range of 59\% to 85\%. The spectroradiometer dataset was further
   analyzed using SVM regression models for estimating nutrient levels.
   Either SMLR-selected features or partial least square (PLS) latent
   variables were used for establishing the above regression models. The
   models fitted on the SMLR features performed better for N, Mg, Ca, and
   B, with correlation coefficients (r) for test datasets in the range of
   0.45 to 0.78. The best fitted SVM regression models were for boron
   estimation, with a correlation coefficient of 0.78 and root mean squared
   error of prediction (RMSEP) of 2.82.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Pages = {{219-238}},
Abstract = {{Based on knowledge and findings that existing binder tests may not
   accurately predict cracking performance at intermediate temperatures,
   this study embarked in the development a new binder fracture energy test
   to fill this void. Nonlinear 3-D finite element analysis (FEA) was used
   to identify and optimise an appropriate specimen geometry to allow for
   accurate determination of true stress and strain on the fracture plane,
   thereby ensuring accurate determination of fracture energy. Various
   binders were tested at multiple temperatures and loading rates using
   prototype specimens in order to evaluate the feasibility and validity of
   different specimen geometries. The researchers used nonlinear FEA
   results to establish a data interpretation system and develop a set of
   diagrams to simplify calculation procedures. After extensive observation
   of test results, the researchers concluded that the new fracture energy
   test and data interpretation system suitably measure unmodified and
   modified binder fracture energy density. The test results reveal that
   binder fracture energy is a fundamental property of binder and that
   characteristic of the true stress-true strain relationship is a good
   indicator of the presence and relative content of modifiers.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2406}},
Pages = {{23-31}},
Abstract = {{Anchor bolts in annular stand-off base plates connecting cantilever sign
   and signal structures to concrete foundations may experience high shear
   from base plate torsion and direct shear forces. A three-phase
   experimental study evaluated the steel shear strength of anchor bolts in
   grouted and ungrouted annular stand-off base plate connections to
   concrete. Phase 1 included flush-mounted and ungrouted stand-off base
   plates with 5/8- and 1-in.-diameter bolts loaded in direct shear. Phase
   2 employed a novel torsion test approach on 10 circular groups of six
   5/8-in.-diameter bolts installed in flush-mounted, ungrouted stand-off,
   and grouted stand-off base plates, along with three ungrouted groups of
   three 1-in.-diameter bolts. Phase 3 comprised one ungrouted and three
   grouted full-scale annular base plate tests of six 1.25-in.-diameter
   bolts under predominantly torsion loading. Results from this study
   suggest that AASHTO's provisions allowing bolt bending stresses to be
   ignored for anchor bolts with an exposed length of less than one bolt
   diameter overestimate ultimate strength. The beam model suggested by
   AASHTO accounting for anchor bolt bending fits experimental data well
   and is recommended for all ungrouted annular stand-off base plates. The
   American Concrete Institute's 0.8 reduction factor for steel shear
   strength of anchor bolts in grouted connections was found to be
   conservative and is also recommended.}},

   analysis that provides an insight into and prediction of possible
   underlying pathogenic processes which may help understand disease
   pathogenesis. In addition, this analysis serves as a tool to identify

Title = {{Review of ophthalmic drug delivery by contact lenses}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF DRUG DELIVERY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{123-135}},
Abstract = {{Ophthalmic drugs are almost exclusively delivered through eye drops in
   spite of several deficiencies including low bioavailability and poor
   compliance. Contact lenses are ideally suited for delivery of drugs to
   the anterior chamber because of the placement directly on the cornea
   which results in a high bioavailability of at least 50 \% compared to
   about 1-5 \% for eye drops. The ten-fold increase in bioavailability
   reduces the amount of drug delivered, which in turn reduces the systemic
   loss of the drug, thereby reducing the potential for side effects.
   Additionally contact lenses can provide a most uniform release profile
   compared to the pulsatile delivery with eye drops, which can potentially
   result in improved therapeutic outcomes. Finally drug delivery via
   extended wear contact lenses can significantly improve the compliance.
   In spite of all these benefits, contact lenses are not yet available as
   drug delivery vehicles mainly because the earlier lens designs were not
   optimized for drug delivery. The interest in developing contact lenses
   for drug delivery has significantly increased in the last decade as
   several new techniques have been developed for designing contact lenses
   for extended drug delivery. The latest studies show that contact lenses
   can achieve extended release of a few weeks without any significant
   impact on critical lens properties. Also in vivo animal studies have
   proven safety, efficacy and increased bioavailability compared to eye
   drops. The future appears promising for drug eluting contact lenses but
   several challenges remain to be overcome regarding processing and
   storage issues, lack of use in the elderly population. regulatory
   issues, high costs of clinical studies and cost-benefit analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The heaving of ocean waves is a largely untapped, renewable kinetic
   energy resource. Conversion of this energy into electrical power could
   integrate with solar technologies to provide for round-the-clock,
   portable, and mobile energy supplies usable in a wide variety of marine
   environments. However, the direct drive conversion methodology of
   grid-integrated wave energy converters does not efficiently scale down
   to smaller, portable architectures. This research develops an
   alternative power conversion approach to harness the extraordinarily
   large heaving displacements and long oscillation periods as an
   excitation source for an extendible vibration energy harvesting chain.
   Building upon related research findings and engineering insights, the
   proposed system joins together a series of dynamic cells through
   bistable interfaces. Individual impulse events are generated as the
   inertial mass of each cell is pulled across a region of negative
   stiffness to induce local snap through dynamics; the oscillating
   magnetic inertial mass then generates current in a coil which is
   connected to energy harvesting circuitry. It is shown that linking the
   cells into a chain transmits impulses through the system leading to
   cascades of vibration and enhancement of electrical energy conversion
   from each impulse event. This paper describes the development of the
   multistable chain and ways in which realistic design challenges were
   addressed. Numerical modeling and corresponding experiments demonstrate
   the response of the chain due to slow and large amplitude input motion.
   Lastly, experimental studies give evidence that energy conversion
   efficiency of the chain for wave energy conversion is much higher than
   using an equal number of cells without connections.}},

   to control of heliostat mirrors for solar harvesting. The complexities
   associated with coupling time-dependent Maxwell's equations with linear
   momentum and mechanics is discussed by introducing a set of electronic
   order parameters that govern the coupling between electromagnetic
   radiation and mechanics of a deformable solid. Numerical examples are
   given illustrating how this methodology is applied to a special class of
   liquid crystal polymer networks containing azobenzene. The dynamics
   associated with light absorption and its effect on deformation of the
   polymer are solved in three dimensions using finite difference methods
   and compared to experimental results. Particular emphasis is placed on
   the effect of polarized light on microstructure evolution and stresses
   that occur during photoisomerization of the optically active
   microstructure.}},

Abstract = {{A 2-D axial symmetric time-dependant mathematical model was developed to
   investigate conditions for onset of under-deposit corrosion. A model for
   corrosion in fluids containing dissolved oxygen is presented. The
   presence of anodic and cathodic regions was not assumed a priori, but
   was rather the result of numerical simulations, which revealed galvanic
   coupling caused by the differential aeration cells. In contrast to
   models presented in the literature, the conservation equation for each
   ionic species was employed in this work rather than Laplace's equation.
   The model included coupled, nonlinear, convective diffusion equations
   for ionic species, which included the contribution of migration; local
   electroneutrality; homogeneous reactions; formation of primary
   precipitates; and anodic and cathodic reactions written explicitly in
   terms of local concentration and potential driving forces. (C) 2014 The

   between the PM10 inlet and the 8 x 10 inch after filter. Filters in this

   concentrations, representing a specie primarily found in the fine mode
   aerosol and proton-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) for determining
   concentrations of Si, S, Ca and Fe, representing species normally found

Title = {{Design of Optimum Sampling Plans for Dry Powders and Slurries}},
Journal = {{KONA POWDER AND PARTICLE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{31}},
Pages = {{82-91}},
Abstract = {{Generally, in order to learn about a certain quality of a population, a
   small portion (sample) is extracted and analyzed for the desired
   property. In order to obtain accurate information, the sample has to
   represent the stream it is taken from (plant feed, intermediate product,
   and/or final product). In materials processing sampling of materials
   (powders or slurries) is very important to the quality control and
   quality assurance purposes. This sample can be too large and has to be
   further subdivided, or too small and a two-stage sampler has to be
   introduced. In most cases, the desired property is determined by
   analyzing a sample as small as a few milligrams. In this regard,
   obtaining a representative sample is not as straightforward as it
   sounds. For homogeneous materials, it is easy to use statistical
   probabilities to estimate numbers and sizes of samples that accurately
   represent the whole population. However, this is not so easy in the
   actual practice especially dealing with inhomogeneous materials.
   Therefore, sampling representativeness, perhaps the most important
   aspect of sampling practice is emphasized in this paper. Sampling
   strategies and equipment for dry materials and slurries are discussed
   with links to related literature and sampling equipment manufacturers.}},

Title = {{Geographic Variation of Rice Yield Response to Past Climate Change in
   China}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{7, SI}},
Pages = {{1586-1598}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies demonstrated climate change had reduced rice yield in
   China, but the magnitude of the reduction and the spatial variations of
   the impact have remained in controversy to date. Based on a gridded
   daily weather dataset, we found there were obvious changes in
   temperatures, diurnal temperature range, and radiation during the
   rice-growing season from 1961 to 2010 in China. These changes resulted
   in a significant decline of simulated national rice yield (simulated
   with CERES-Rice), with a magnitude of 11.5\%. However, changes in
   growing-season radiation and diurnal temperature range, not
   growing-season temperatures, contributed most to the simulated yield
   reduction, which confirmed previous estimates by empirical studies.
   Yield responses to changes of the climatic variables varied across
   different rice production areas. In rice production areas with the mean
   growing-season temperature at 12-14 degrees C and above 20 degrees C, a
   1 degrees C growing-season warming decreased rice yield by roughly 4\%.
   This decrease was partly attributed to increased heat stresses and
   shorter growth period under the warmer climate. In some rice areas of
   the southern China and the Yangtze River Basin where the rice
   growing-season temperature was greater than 20 degrees C, decrease in
   the growing-season radiation partly interpreted the widespread yield
   decline of the simulation, suggesting the significant negative
   contribution of recent global dimming on rice production in China's main
   rice areas. Whereas in the northern rice production areas with
   relatively low growing-season temperature, decrease of the diurnal
   temperature range was identified as the main climatic contributor for
   the decline of simulated rice yield, with larger decreasing magnitude
   under cooler areas.}},

Abstract = {{Ongoing efforts are being made to develop biochar materials that can
   enhance phosphate sorption for application as a mitigation method to
   prevent phosphorus transport. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) embedded

   high phosphate adsorption capabilities, but this pyrolysis-based
   technique is complex and costly. This study successfully prepared a
   hydrochar-LDH nanocomposite material using a one-step hydrothermal
   method. Morphological analysis indicated that needle-like nano-sized LDH
   crystals were well formed within the hydrochar matrix. The hydrochar-LDH
   nanocomposite demonstrated rapid phosphate sorption kinetics and a
   maximum sorption capacity of 386 mg g(-1), which is comparable to the
   biochar-LDH nanocomposites prepared by liquid-phase deposition. The
   comparable sorption capacity of the hydrochar-LDH nanocomposite presents
   an attractive phosphate sorbent material that can be produced using a
   cost-effective, simple procedure.}},

Abstract = {{Defects produced from the application of electrical stress to AlGaN/GaN
   high electron mobility transistors were studied. The defects observed
   include micron-length cracking of the AlGaN and GaN layers, a reaction
   of the native oxide interfacial layer between the gate contact and AlGaN
   epilayer resulting in a band defect, and an electrochemical pitting
   reaction between the gate contact and AlGaN epilayer. These defects were
   characterized using a combination of surface etching chemical
   deprocessing, top-down scanning electron microscopy, and cross sectional
   transmission electron microscopy. The cracks in the AlGaN and GaN layers
   are shown to lengthen under application of electrical stress. The band
   defects appear to coincide with a large increase in gate leakage current
   associated with the critical voltage during electrical stressing.
   However, continued electrical stressing past the critical voltage
   results in pitting of the AlGaN epilayer under and near the gate
   contact. Simulations of the electric field lines from these pitted
   devices match the defect morphology across a range of different stress
   conditions and device structures and geometries.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of 5 MeV proton irradiation on DC performance and reliability
   of circular-shaped AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors were
   investigated. The drain saturation current (I-DSS) reduced 12.5\% and
   the sheet resistance increased 9.2\% after irradiation with a dose of
   2x10(14) 1/cm(2). Threshold voltage shifted more positively with a dose
   of 2x10(14) 1/cm(2) compared to 2x10(13)/cm(2). Besides, the breakdown
   voltage improved 39.8\% after irradiation with dose of 2x10(14) 1/cm(2).
   Simulation was done and the peak electric field at the drain side of the
   gate edge was found to be reduced after irradiation. The defects
   generated after irradiation at the AlGaN/GaN interface create a virtual
   gate and thus reduce the electric field. Gate lag measurement was
   performed to characterize the defects. The current dispersion of DC to
   high frequency indicates the defects had been generated after
   irradiation, which is in agreement with the simulation data.}},

Abstract = {{We model the effect of radiation damage on AlGaN/GaN HEMTs in FLOODS.
   While excellent fits are obtained for threshold voltage shift, the
   models do not fully explain the increased reliability observed
   experimentally. In short, the addition of negatively-charged traps in
   the GaN buffer layer does not significantly change the electric field at
   the gate edges at radiation fluence levels seen in this study. We
   propose that negative trapped charge at the nitride/AlGaN interface
   actually produces the virtual-gate effect that results in decreasing the
   magnitude of the electric field at the gate edges and thus the increase
   in critical voltage. Simulation results including nitride interface
   charge show significant changes in electric field profiles while the I-V
   device characteristics do not change.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in the drain current that correspond to charge trap energies in
   the band-gap of AlGaN/GaN High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs)
   were measured when illuminated by below band-gap light. The energy of
   the applied wavelength of light affects the trapping and de-trapping of
   carriers within the band-gap, providing an indicator of trap densities.
   These changes were compared on HEMTs with gate lengths of 0.14 \& 0.17
   mu m, before and after electrically stressing under on-state (V-G = 0
   V), off-state (V-G = -5 V), and typical operating conditions (V-G = -2V)
   indicating a change in trap density as a result of electrical stressing.
   Changes in trap densities were minimal after both off-state and on-state
   stressing but significant trap creation in the range E-C = -0.4-0.6 eV
   were observed in HEMTs exhibiting gradual degradation during stressing.
   Energy levels corresponding to these values in the literature have been
   suggested to correlate Ga-N and N-Ga substitutional defects, as well as
   Ga-I interstitials.}},

Abstract = {{In this study we tested the effectiveness of graphene as a solid state
   diffusion barrier for titanium, which forms a strong bond with graphene
   and copper, which is weakly bonded to graphene. E-beam deposited
   titanium films on silicon were annealed with and without graphene
   barrier layers to determine if graphene will prevent a titanium silicide
   layer from forming. In addition copper on silica was studied with a
   graphene barrier to determine if the graphene would prevent copper
   diffusion into the underlying substrate. For titanium, the graphene
   layer is sacrificial and prevents or inhibits silicide formation. In the
   case of copper, surface diffusion of copper clusters on graphene is the
   failure mechanism and not diffusion through the graphene barrier.}},

Title = {{Surface finishing of cobalt chromium alloy femoral knee components}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the modification of surface roughness and lay of
   cobalt chromium alloy femoral knee components by magnetic abrasive
   finishing (MAF), including clarification of the MAF surface-processing
   mechanisms. The MAF process creates characteristic surfaces by
   micro-cutting of abrasive pressed by magnetic particles that nearly
   conform to the surface, removing large asperities and creating
   microasperities compared to hand-buffed surfaces. The process enables
   smoothing the surface on the nanometer scale with critical control of
   surface lay (e.g., crosshatch angle), altering the contact angle of
   water by a combination of kinematic behavior of magnetic particles over
   the freeform condyle surface. (C) 2014 CIRP.}},
