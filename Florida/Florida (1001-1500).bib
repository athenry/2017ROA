Abstract = {{A resilient and secure control system should be designed to be as safe
   and robust as possible in face of different types of attacks such as
   fault data injection (FDI) attacks; thus, nowadays, the control
   designers should also consider the probable attacks in their control
   design from the beginning. For this reason, detection of intentional
   faults and cyber-attacks attracts a great concern among researchers.
   This issue plays a great role in the safety of unmanned aerial vehicles
   (UAVs) due to the need of continuous supervision and control of these
   systems. In order to have a cyber-attack tolerant (CAT) controller, the
   attack and the type of attack should be detected in the first step. This
   paper introduces a new algorithm to detect fault data injection attack
   in UAV. An adaptive neural network is used to detect the injected faults
   in sensors of an UAV. An embedded Kalman filter (EKF) is used for online
   tuning of neural networks weights; these online tuning makes the attack
   detection faster and more accurate. The simulation results show that the
   proposed method can successfully detect FDI attacks applied to an UAV.

Abstract = {{Advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs) enhance transportation safety
   and mobility, and reduce impacts on the environment and economical
   costs, through decreasing driver errors. One of the main features of
   ADASs is cruise control system that maintains the driver's desired speed
   without intervention from the driver. Adaptive cruise control (ACC)
   systems adjust the vehicle's speed to maintain a safe following distance
   to the vehicle in front. Adding vehicle-to-vehicle and
   vehicle-to-infrastructure communications (V2X) to ACC systems, result in
   cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) systems, where each vehicle
   has trajectory data of all other vehicles in the same lane. Although
   CACC systems offer advantages over ACC systems in increasing throughput
   and average speed, they are more vulnerable to cyber-security attacks.
   This is due to V2X communications that increase the attack surface from
   one vehicle to multiple vehicles. In this paper, we inject common types
   of attack on the application layer of connected vehicles to show their
   vulnerability in comparison to autonomous vehicles. We also proposed a
   decision support system that eliminates risk of inaccurate information.
   The microscopic work simulates a CACC system with a bi-objective PID
   controller and a fuzzy detector. A case study is illustrated in detail
   to verify the system functionality. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been extensively used
   because of their lower non-recurring engineering and design costs,
   instant availability and reduced visibility of failure, high performance
   and power benefits. Reports indicate that counterfeit FPGAs are
   infiltrating the IC supply chain, most of which are recycled type
   (previously used). Counterfeit components pose a significant threat to
   the government and industrial sectors of the economy because they
   undermine the security and reliability of the critical systems and
   networks. Recycled FPGA detection procedures include parametric test,
   functional test, and burn-in test that requires golden data and/or parts
   specifications from original component manufacturers. In this work, a
   sophisticated ring oscillator design method is used to exploit all the
   possible paths in look-up tables (LUTs). A recycled FPGA is likely to
   have fully used, partially used, and unused LUTs. The proposed mapping
   targets all paths of LUTs and forms a frequency array. A support vector
   machine is trained with frequency array from unused FPGAs, which
   differentiates between unused and aged FPGAs. An unsupervised method
   based on k-means clustering is also proposed to classify recycled
   components without golden information. Simulation and silicon results
   demonstrate high rates of success using the proposed methods.}},

   ATPG-generated transition delay patterns into LBIST patterns, and the
   corresponding responses are utilized in developing the predictor. A
   gate-overlap and path delay-aware pattern selection algorithm selects
   the features for the classier. Using clock sweeping, LBIST is able to
   capture the aging effect on targeted paths. The result of machine
   learning is then utilized to activate countermeasures to remedy the
   degradation in the field. The area and test time overhead are very low.

   TREE DAMAGE AND FRUIT DETACHMENT MODELS}},

Abstract = {{Mechanization of fruit and nut harvesting is becoming increasingly
   important because of a significant rise in the cost of manual
   harvesting. This work proposes a progressive analytical approach for the
   design and optimization of a citrus canopy shaker harvesting machine.
   The approach was formulated using finite element (FE) methods to find
   the optimum design parameters of the machine. The design parameters were
   defined in terms of a configuration (or stiffness) of shaking rods and
   two operating parameters: shaking frequency and shaking amplitude. The
   formulated methodology consists of determining the properties of wood,
   statistical modeling of the tree limbs, developing mechanistic models,
   and performing optimization using FE simulations. The proposed
   methodology employs the response surface methodology or surrogate models
   to quantify the objective functions, and Pareto-optimal search
   techniques to find the optimum designs. Three sets of machine parameters
   were proposed in this study to minimize tree damage and maximize fruit
   removal. These optimal parameters were proposed based on the
   configuration and distribution of limbs and fruits in a medium-size
   citrus tree. The optimized tine configuration of the middle and bottom
   section of the canopy shaker consists of a solid rod made of polyamide
   reinforced with 50\% long glass fibers and a hollow tube made of
   hardened steel in a 3:1 ratio by length. These tines, when vibrating at
   a high frequency of 7.8 Hz and low amplitude of 3.81 to 5.08 cm (1.5 to
   2 in.) and a low frequency of 3 to 3.5 Hz and high amplitude of 13.9 to
   15.2 cm (5.5 to 6 in.), provide a 25\% to 30\% reduction in damage to
   the tree limbs in the bottom and middle zones of the tree. Similarly,
   changes to the top sections of the canopy shaker with another set of
   optimized tine configurations resulted in a 40\% to 45\% reduction in
   the damage to the limbs of the top section of the tree canopy. The
   optimized tine configuration, thus proposed for the top section of the
   canopy shaker, is made of a solid rod of polyamide reinforced with 60\%
   long glass fibers and vibrates at a frequency of 6.5 to 7.5 Hz with an
   amplitude of 7.6 to 8.9 cm (3 to 3.5 in.).}},

   GOOGLE EARTH ENGINE CLOUD-BASED PLATFORM: OPPORTUNITIES FOR
   NON-SPECIALISTS IN REMOTE SENSING}},
Journal = {{Transactions of the ASABE}},

Abstract = {{The complex nature of coupled human-natural systems often hinders the
   identification of forces and mechanisms causing observed environmental
   changes. The analysis of long-term time series can allow better
   understanding of those interactions and hence inform more adapted
   restoration and management programs. However, long-term time series of
   ground-measured vegetation variables are often not readily available due
   to the tediousness of the work and the financial and time investment
   required, especially for large-scale wetland systems. Remote sensing can
   help overcome this issue by providing more than 40 years of Earth cover
   images, but until recently the processing and analysis of these images
   was restricted to experts in remote sensing. The new Google Earth Engine
   (GEE) opens the remote sensing information mine to engineers or
   scientists without advanced knowledge in the field, including easy
   access to petabytes of publicly available remote sensing data and their
   spatial analysis in the cloud. To illustrate its capabilities, we used
   GEE to generate time series of the normalized difference vegetation
   index (NDVI) for the human-impacted Tempisque watershed with its
   severely degraded downstream Palo Verde wetland in northwest Costa Rica.
   We detail the processing and analysis steps to facilitate replication to
   any other case study. After defining the boundary of a study area, any
   user can generate a list and a video of the Landsat and MODIS images
   available for the area, NDVI maps, and a time series of the NDVI values
   spatially aggregated over the study area or a set of previously
   delineated polygons. One of the challenges we address is discriminating
   between the multitude of image collections available in the GEE catalog
   for vegetation mapping. We evaluate and compare the results obtained
   from five selected Landsat and MODIS image collections and identify the
   collections that give the best quality results for our case study. We
   conclude that MODIS is more appropriate for this tropical region because
   of the higher temporal resolution and hence higher probability to record
   cloud-free images. NDVI time series from Landsat images demonstrate a
   significant number of missing values. Landsat maps of NDVI suggest that
   the entire watershed and protected wetland witnessed an overall increase
   in vegetation greenness and hence cover since 1986, matching the
   abandonment of cattle ranching and the known degradation of the wetland
   by cattail invasion. Within-season vegetation variability can be tracked
   using MODIS images despite their coarser spatial resolution, showing
   high variability linked to precipitation patterns in this region. This
   GEE application illustrates new opportunities for biosystems engineers
   and other scientists to integrate historical vegetation and land cover
   data into comprehensive datasets to understand human impacts on
   ecosystems, and provides the guidance to do so.}},

   improves functional unit and entire system lifetime by considering two

   information, system behavior can be predicted and appropriate thread
   scheduling and migration decisions can be made. Our method incorporates
   temperature predictions based on recent historical temperatures and
   functional unit usages to rank threads and cores in a chip
   multiprocessor (CMP). Using these rankings, our method migrates threads
   among cores to reduce thermal hotspots. Simulation results on the ESESC

Abstract = {{Using a mobile phone for fine-grained indoor localization remains an
   open problem. Low-complexity approaches without infrastructure could not
   achieve accurate and reliable results due to various restrictions.
   Accurate solutions relying on dense anchor nodes are inconvenient and
   cumbersome in deployment. The anchor blockage problem would further
   reduce the effective coverages. In this paper, we investigate the
   problems associated with improving indoor localization of a mobile phone
   via opportunistic anchor sensing, a new sensing paradigm leveraging
   multiple anchors without minimum number or constellation requirement.
   One key motivation is that the location results could be improved by
   exploring more data types rather than deploying more anchor nodes. To
   enable this high scalability and accuracy design, we leverage
   low-coupling hybrid ranging by our low cost anchor nodes with
   centimeter-level relative distance estimation. Activity pattern
   extracted in local smartphone is utilized for accurate displacement and
   direction estimation. Finer localization resolution could be achieved
   with sufficient anchor access. We introduce the delay-constraint robust
   semidefinite programming in trilateration calculation with the potential
   of centimeter-level location resolution. We conduct extensive
   experiments in various scenarios. Compared with other approaches,
   opportunistic sensing could improve the location accuracy, scalability
   as well as robustness under various anchor accessibilities.}},

   parameters were close to those of long-spark leaders observed in the
   same experiments, while the channel morphology was distinctly different
   from that of leaders, so that UPFs can be viewed as a new type of
   in-cloud discharge. These formations can occur in the absence of spark
   leaders and appear to be manifestations of collective processes
   building, essentially from scratch, a complex hierarchical network of
   interacting channels at different stages of development (some of which
   are hot and live for milliseconds). We believe that the phenomenon
   should commonly occur in thunderclouds and might give insights on the

Abstract = {{Nowadays Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and spatial database
   systems are mainly able to handle crisp spatial objects, i.e., objects
   in space whose locations, extents, shapes, and boundaries are precisely
   determined. However, geoscientists and advanced GIS applications are
   increasingly interested in handling spatial objects that are
   characterized by the feature of spatial fuzziness and do not have sharp
   but blurred boundaries and/or interiors; hence, we call them fuzzy
   spatial objects. Examples are air polluted areas and temperature zones.
   In the same way as fuzzy spatial objects are blurred, the topological
   relationships (e.g., overlap, inside) between them are blurred too. In
   this conceptual paper, we propose a novel model to formally define fuzzy
   topological relationships for simple and complex fuzzy regions. Such a
   fuzzy relationship computes a membership degree between 0 and 1 that
   indicates to which extent this relationship holds. It is mapped to a
   high-level fuzzy modifier and transformed into a Boolean predicate that
   can be embedded into spatial queries.}},

Abstract = {{Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have substantially advanced the
   state-of-the-art accuracies of object recognition, which is the core
   function of a myriad of modern multimedia processing techniques such as
   image/video processing, speech recognition, and natural language
   processing. GPU-based accelerators gained increasing attention because a
   large amount of highly parallel neurons in CNN naturally matches the GPU
   computation pattern. In this work, we perform comprehensive experiments
   to investigate the performance bottlenecks and overheads of current GPU
   acceleration platform for scale-out CNN-based big data processing.
   In our characterization, we observe two significant semantic gaps:
   framework gap that lies between CNN-based data processing workflow and
   data processing manner in distributed framework; and the standalone gap
   that lies between the uneven computation loads at different CNN layers
   and fixed computing capacity provisioning of current GPU acceleration
   library. To bridge these gaps, we propose (DNN)-N-3, a Distributed,
   Decoupled, and Dynamically tuned GPU acceleration framework for modern
   CNN architectures. In particular, (DNN)-N-3 features a novel analytical
   model that enables accurate time estimation of GPU accelerated CNN
   processing with only 5-10\% error. Our evaluation results show the
   throughput of standalone processing node using (DNN)-N-3 gains up to
   3.7X performance improvement over current standalone GPU acceleration
   platform. Our CNN-oriented GPU acceleration library with built-in
   dynamic batching scheme achieves up to 1.5X performance improvement over
   the non-batching scheme and outperforms the state-of-the-art deep
   learning library by up to 28\% (performance mode) 67\% (memory-efficient
   mode).}},

Abstract = {{This research improves upon prior research efforts on the hydrothermal
   synthesis of barium titanate (BaTiO3) films. It has been established
   that BaTiO3 can be synthesized using a two-step hydrothermal reaction
   that first synthesizes TiO2 then converts it to BaTiO3. Past research,
   however, resulted in relatively low ferroelectric properties using this
   technique. The research addresses that shortcoming by offering an
   optimized hydrothermal synthesis process that significantly increase the
   electromechanical coupling of the BaTiO3 film. Here, it is shown that
   the d(33) achieves a value of 80 pm/V, which is the bulk BaTiO3 value.
   Additionally, this optimization results in an enhanced dielectric
   constant of 1600. Therefore, this research reveals that the
   ferroelectric properties of a hydrothermally synthesized BaTiO3 film can
   be significantly enhanced through slight modifications in the
   hydrothermal processing procedure.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a fabrication process for the conformal growth of
   vertically aligned BaTiO3 films on 3-dimensionally patterned silicon
   waters. The conformal growth is performed through a two-step
   hydrothermal reaction that enables the direct growth of piezoelectric
   films on nonplanar architectures while utilizing relatively low
   synthesis temperatures. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is used to
   show the controllable conversion of TiO2 nanowires to BaTiO3 films and
   x-ray diffraction (XRD) is used to validate the crystal structures.
   Tested by a refined piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) method, the
   conformal films exhibited a piezoelectric coupling coefficient as high
   as 100 pm/V. With superior piezoelectric properties and the capability
   to grow on design specific surfaces, the BaTiO3 conformal films
   demonstrate high potential for sensors, random access memory, and other
   micro electromechanical systems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes to use tradable credits to control the maximum queue
   length at a bottleneck. Given a queue length threshold specified by the
   traffic authority, the authors designed a tradable credit scheme to
   maintain the queue length of the bottleneck to be less than the
   threshold for homogenous travelers. The scheme was compared against a
   multi-step tolling scheme under demand uncertainty. The authors then
   studied the capability of the tradable credit scheme in the presence of
   two types of user heterogeneity: proportional heterogeneity and
   heterogeneity in unit schedule penalty associated with late arrival
   (gamma heterogeneity). It was found that the proposed scheme could
   successfully maintain the queue length under proportional heterogeneity,
   but not necessarily under gamma heterogeneity. However, if the
   distribution of gamma heterogeneity were known in advance, the scheme
   could be modified to ensure success in controlling queue length.}},

Abstract = {{Kernel adaptive filters (KAFs) are powerful tools for online nonlinear
   system modeling, which are direct extensions of traditional linear
   adaptive filters in kernel space, with growing linear-in-the-parameters
   (LIP) structure. However, like most other nonlinear adaptive filters,
   the KAFs are ``black box{''} models where no prior information about the
   unknown nonlinear system is utilized. If some prior information is
   available, the ``grey box{''} models may achieve improved performance.
   In this work, we consider the kernel adaptive filtering with prior
   information in terms of equality function constraints. A novel Mercer
   kernel, called the constrained Mercer kernel (CMK), is proposed. With
   this new kernel, we develop the kernel least mean square subject to
   equality function constraints (KLMS-EFC), which can satisfy the
   constraints perfectly while achieving significant performance
   improvement.}},

Abstract = {{While High-Performance Computing is ever more pervasive and effective,
   computing capability is currently only a small fraction of what is
   needed. Three fundamental issues limiting performance are computational
   efficiency, power density, and communication latency. All of these
   issues are being addressed through increased heterogeneity, but the last
   in particular by integrating communication into the accelerator. This
   integration enables direct and programmable communication among compute
   components. Novo-G\# is a large-scale FPGA-centric cluster being built
   to investigate and develop architectures, system and tool
   infrastructure, and applications for this model. In this report we
   discuss the motivation behind and particular objectives of Novo-G\#, the
   work completed so far, the products of that work, and their potential
   impact. We end with a description of and an invitation to join the

Abstract = {{\textbackslash{}Low-power, embedded, GPU System-on-Chip (SoC) devices
   provide outstanding computational performance, especially for
   compute-intensive tasks. While clusters of SoCs for High-Performance
   Embedded Computing (HPEC) are not new, the computational power of these
   supercomputers has long lacked the efficiency of their more traditional,
   High-Performance Computing (HPC) counterparts. With the advent of the
   Tegra K1 and X1, the efficiency debate is significantly more complex.
   These new devices can provide up to 500 GFLOPS of Float32 performance
   with a TDP of just 10 Watts. This paper investigates the current state
   of NVIDIA SoCs, comparing and contrasting their performance and power
   characteristics to high-end NVIDIA accelerators. In order to perform
   this analysis, we leverage two metrics, Computational Density (CD) and
   External Memory Bandwidth (EMB), to provide a first-order estimate and
   then normalize the results with Realizable Utilization (RU). RU is a
   measurement of device efficiency, comparing observed bench-marking
   results to the theoretical CD or EMB. From this analysis, we are able to
   uncover which computational kernels might show similar or improved
   performance on an HPEC cluster of NVIDIA Tegra SoCs. Based on our
   observations, an SoC cluster would be plausible for some
   power-constrained HPC applications. Furthermore, the observed
   performance improvement in Tegra devices suggests that a future GPU-SoC
   cluster could be an option for a wide range of applications.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time, low-latency, image processing with high throughput is vital
   for many time-critical applications in fields such as medical imaging,
   robotics, and wearable computers. Traditionally, FPGAs have often been
   employed to meet these requirements. However, due to the productivity
   challenges, using FPGAs may not be viable in some cases. Alternatively,
   the typical approach of processing an image on a CPU device at a frame
   level increases the processing latency of the computer-vision system. In
   this paper, we explore the feasibility of processing an input image at a
   sub-frame level on a multi-core SoC device, the 66AK2H12 from TI. Using
   sub-frame processing, we optimize and evaluate the performance of four
   kernels commonly used in image-processing pipelines. Our results show,
   for all four kernels in our study, that real-time, low-latency image
   processing with high throughput for HD-resolution images can be achieved
   using the multiple DSP cores available in the 66AK2H12 device.}},

   (3D) bioprinting has enabled the printing of biocompatible materials,

   the main technological barriers for building 3D organs, the freeform
   printing of 3D biological vascular constructs is of great importance to
   prove the overall feasibility of 3D bioprinting techniques. In this
   study, vascular-like constructs are fabricated by both laser- and
   inkjet-based printing techniques using a liquid support-based approach,
   which utilizes a calcium chloride-based solution as a cross-linking
   agent and buoyancy-based support material. 3D constructs such as
   Y-shaped tubular constructs have been successfully fabricated from
   alginate-based and cell-laden bioinks with a satisfactory post-printing

Abstract = {{Titanium (Ti) and its alloys are currently used extensively in medical
   and dental applications due to their superior mechanical and physical
   properties compared to coarse-grained (CG) Ti. However, the presence of
   alloying elements such as aluminum and vanadium has raised concerns
   about Ti alloy biocompatibility. Fortunately, equal channel angular
   extrusion (ECAE)-processed ultrafine-grained (UFG) Ti, which has a grain
   structure on the submicron level, has emerged as a viable alternative.
   The substantial reduction in grain size results in distinct material
   property differences, which may affect the dynamic material behavior. In
   this study, the chip morphology, which is an indication of the dynamic
   behavior of materials, of ECAE-processed Ti after machining is evaluated
   and compared with that of CG Ti. The chip morphology for both Ti
   materials is found to transform as the cutting speed increases while
   ECAE Ti has a different shear band spacing, indicating that ECAE Ti
   responds differently to deformation when compared with CG Ti.}},

Abstract = {{Deposition of continuous, dense WOx films and nanorods was accomplished
   by aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD) using the recently
   synthesized precursors WO(OCH3)(3)(acac) (1), WO(OCH2C(CH3)(3))(3)(tbac)
   (2), WO(OCH2C(CH3)(3))(3)(dpm) (3), WO(OC(CH3)(3))(3)(tbac) (4), and
   WO(OCH2C(CH3)(3))(3)(tbpa) (5). This works seeks to define the
   deposition conditions and precursors that yield C-free tungsten oxide
   and the potential to control the stoichiometry and phase of deposited
   WOx. In addition, the systematic variation of the ligand chemistry
   provides insight into precursor design. Variation of the precursor and
   growth temperature during deposition revealed a window where C-free WOx
   was deposited using 3, 4, and 5. The surface morphology of the WOx
   varied from amorphous thin film to crystalline nanorods to dendrites as
   temperature was increased. Films grown between 150 and 350 degrees C in
   pure N-2 atmosphere are sub-stoichiometric, amorphous and contaminated
   with carbide species (3-9 at.\%). As the deposition temperature
   increased (400-550 degrees C), the tungsten became more oxidized, the
   sub-stoichiometric crystalline W18O49 monoclinic phase formed, and
   increased surface bound C was detected. Material was also deposited
   under oxidizing conditions (1-2\% O-2 in N-2) as well as annealing in
   air at the deposition temperature. The material grown in N-2/O-2 carrier
   gas at low temperatures (200 and 300 degrees C) is amorphous WOx,
   similar to that grown in N-2. At higher temperature (350 and 550 degrees
   C), however, GIXRD results reveal WOx corresponding to a
   sub-stoichiometric tetragonal phase transitioning to the monoclinic WO3
   phase for samples grown at 550 degrees C. This demonstrates that
   crystalline structure of WOx is affected by the growth temperature and
   introducing O-2 in the carrier gas. Air annealing samples grown in pure
   N-2 also produced structural and compositional changes, but not
   identical to those grown in a N-2/O-2 carrier gas. Notably, annealing
   samples grown at 250 and 350 degrees C at the same temperature, produced
   C-free material with unchanged amorphous morphology. The measured
   stoichiometry and crystallinity showed a dependence on the precursor
   structure. The growth rate of deposited material was measured as a
   function of temperature and activation energies were estimated for
   growth of amorphous and nanostructured material. The systematic
   variation in activation energies is consistent with initial dissociation
   of the alkoxide C-O bonds and modifications of the steric bulk of the
   beta-diketonate ligand. (C) 2016 The Electrochemical Society. All rights

Abstract = {{The use of ultra low energy ion implantation is investigated as a doping
   method for MoS2. 200 eV Cl and Ar implants at doses between 1 x 10(13)
   and 1 x 10(15) cm(-2) were introduced into exfoliated MoS2 flakes. XPS
   results for Cl implants show a decrease in core peak binding energies
   for Mo3d and S2p with increasing dose, implying a p-doping effect.
   Implantation of MoS2 device channel regions is shown to reduce the
   channel's conductivity. However, isolated implantation of the contact
   region with low doses (1 x 10(13) cm(-2)) of Cl and Ar are shown to
   improve output characteristics by linearizing the I-DS-V-DS curves and
   by increasing current through the device. Cl was shown to be more
   effective than Ar at increasing the current, implying there is a
   potential chemical effect as well as damage effect. For higher doses (>=
   1 x 10(14) cm(-2)), the current through the device is reduced with
   increasing dose for both implant species. This report presents the
   as-implanted, unannealed results. Post-implantation anneals may be
   necessary to activate the dopants and fully realize the potential of
   this doping method. (C) The Author(s) 2016. Published by ECS. All rights

Abstract = {{The advances in power electronics and the awareness of the use of
   renewable energy has motivated the connection of Distributed Energy
   Resources (DER) into Power Distribution Networks. Additional challenges
   are related to the changes that the presence of DER cause on typical
   radial characteristics of distribution networks, which were not
   considered in the formulation of fault location methods. This paper
   presents a proposal for fault location for power distribution networks
   in presence of Inverter-Interfaced DER when these working in limiting
   current. The proposal uses a fault model of the inverter to consider its
   impact on the fault location. Thus, is assumed that the inverter always
   operates in limiting current mode when a fault event occurs. It allows
   estimate its current contribution to the fault point. A case study in
   the IEEE 34 Node Test Feeder is performed. This system is modeled on
   ATP/EMTP and modified with the insertion of an Inverter-Interfaced DER.
   The method is validated by consideration of two scenarios. Scenario
   1-DER penetration level effect and scenario 2-Fault resistance on the
   proposed method effect. The results obtained presented a maximum error
   of 0.3\%.}},

Abstract = {{The long I/O latency posts significant challenges for many
   data-intensive applications, such as the emerging big data workloads.
   Recently, the NVDIMM (Non-Volatile Dual In-line Memory Module)
   technologies provide a promising solution to this problem. By employing
   non-volatile NAND flash memory as storage media and connecting them via
   DIMM ( Dual In-line Memory Module) slots, the NVDIMM devices are exposed
   to memory bus so the access latencies due to going through I/O
   controllers can be significantly mitigated. However, placing NVDIMM on
   the memory bus introduces new challenges. For instance, by mixing I/O
   and memory traffic, NVDIMM can cause severe performance degradation on
   memory-intensive applications. Besides, there exists a speed mismatch
   between fast memory access and slow flash read/write operations.
   Moreover, garbage collection (GC) in NAND flash may cause up to several
   millisecond latency.
   This paper presents novel, enabling mechanisms that allow NVDIMM to more
   effectively bridge the I/O performance gap for big data workloads. To
   address the workload heterogeneity challenge, we develop a scheduling
   scheme in memory controller to minimize the interference between the
   native and the I/O-derived memory traffic by exploiting both data access
   criticality and resource utilization. For NVDIMM controller, several
   mechanisms are designed to better orchestrate traffic between the memory
   controller and NAND flash to alleviate the speed discrepancy issue. To
   mitigate the lengthy GC period, we propose a proactive GC scheme for the
   NVDIMM controller and flash controller to intelligently synchronize and
   transfer data involving in forthcoming GC operations. We present
   detailed evaluation and analysis to quantify how well our techniques fit
   with the NVDIMM design. Our experimental results show that overall the
   proposed techniques yield 10\%similar to 35\% performance improvements
   over the state-of-the-art baseline schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Inpatient hospital readmissions for potentially avoidable conditions are

   models show high predictive power on a U.S. nationwide readmission
   database. They are also capable of providing interpretable risk factors
   globally at the population level and locally associated with each single
   discharge. In addition, we propose a model-agnostic approach to provide
   confidence for each prediction. Altogether, using models with high
   predictive power, interpretable risk factors and prediction confidence
   may enable health care systems to accurately target high-risk patients
   and prevent recurrent readmissions by accurately anticipating the

   describes the first two phases of this process. Focus group sessions
   were conducted to understand user requirements and generate hand drawn
   images to get users' visions of the application. Themes generated using
   thematic analysis concluded that the users wanted an application with an

Abstract = {{Recent research has demonstrated the severity of co-residency
   side-channel attacks on computing clouds. These attacks have been
   successfully employed by malicious tenants to extract sensitive private
   information from selected neighboring tenants. Solutions towards
   addressing such attacks have presented customized solutions for specific
   variants of these attacks that often require significant modifications
   to the hardware, client virtual machines (VM), or hypervisors. These
   solutions are not generic and will not succeed with mutating versions of
   these attacks. Except for the impractical, resource inefficient, and
   costly single tenant solutions, co-residency will always be an issue to
   cloud service providers. In this paper, inspired from the camouflaging
   process of the sea chameleons evading predators, we present MIGRATE.
   MIGRATE is a container management framework that employs
   resource-efficient, scalable, real-time moving target defense to
   obfuscate the container execution behavior complicating the attacker's
   task to locate their targets. MIGRATE, offers generic defense against
   side-channel attacks and employs efficient real-time probabilistic
   random migrations of cloud tenants' applications contained in Linux
   containers between different hosts. To minimize the probability of
   attacker-victim co-residency on the same host. Eliminating the stable
   co-residency issue eliminates most of the side-channel attacks that face
   such a platform. Given the current implementation of MIGRATE tested on
   VMware V-Sphere Cloud, results showed that it can induce high frequency
   migrations with almost no effect on the enclosed applications making it
   suitable for mission-critical applications and as a mitigation against
   fast side-channel attacks.}},

Abstract = {{Analyzing multi-layered graphical models provides insight into
   understanding the conditional relationships among nodes within layers
   after adjusting for and quantifying the effects of nodes from other
   layers. We obtain the penalized maximum likelihood estimator for
   Gaussian multi-layered graphical models, based on a computational
   approach involving screening of variables, iterative estimation of the
   directed edges between layers and undirected edges within layers and a
   final refitting and stability selection step that provides improved
   performance in finite sample settings. We establish the consistency of
   the estimator in a high-dimensional setting. To obtain this result, we
   develop a strategy that leverages the biconvexity of the likelihood
   function to ensure convergence of the developed iterative algorithm to a
   stationary point, as well as careful uniform error control of the
   estimates over iterations. The performance of the maximum likelihood
   estimator is illustrated on synthetic data.}},

Abstract = {{The explosive demand for live video streaming over wireless networks is
   constantly calling for innovations in both video coding and wireless
   communities. The state-of-the-art answer to this challenge are
   sliding-window-based Delay-Aware Fountain (DAF) codes, which combine the
   channel-adaptive feature in rateless coding and the delay-aware feature
   in video coding. However, a high computational cost is incurred during
   the per-window optimization of sampling pattern, making DAF codes
   impractical for live streaming. To solve this issue, we propose a novel
   online algorithm for DAF codes. By integrating the Model Predictive
   Control (MPC) technique into DAF codes, a finite length of horizon is
   imposed on the optimization algorithm. As a result, the complexity is
   lowered to an affordable level such that real-time video encoding is
   supported. Two schemes are developed in this paper: (i) DAF-M, the
   MPC-based DAF codes, and (ii) DAF-O, the online variant of DAF-M based
   on video bit rate prediction. The advantages of both designs are
   validated through comprehensive experiments. The results of simulation
   experiments show that the decoding ratio of DAF-M is close to the global
   optimum in DAF codes, and higher than the other existing schemes; DAF-O
   outperforms the state-of-the-art live streaming algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{With the explosive growth of mobile data demand, small cells densely
   deployed underlying the homogeneous macrocells are emerging as a
   promising candidate for the fifth generation (5G) mobile network. The
   backhaul communication for small cells poses a significant challenge,
   and with huge bandwidth available in the mmWave band, the wireless
   backhaul at mmWave frequencies can be a promising backhaul solution for
   small cells. In this paper, we propose the Maximum QoS-aware Independent
   Set (MQIS) based scheduling algorithm for the mmWave backhaul network of
   small cells to maximize the number of flows with their QoS requirements
   satisfied. In the algorithm, concurrent transmissions and the QoS aware
   priority are exploited to achieve more successfully scheduled flows and
   higher network throughput. Simulations in the 73 GHz band are conducted
   to demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm in terms of the
   number of successfully scheduled flows and the system throughput
   compared with other existing schemes.}},

   shown that if the minimum image cardinality of a source set over a DMC

   set will be information stable. In many applications, this requirement
   on the source set can be satisfied using the method of equal-image-size

   weak secrecy code for the wiretap channel is provided as an example to
   illustrate the use of the information stabilization technique.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2576}},
Pages = {{51-59}},
Abstract = {{This research was conducted to evaluate the impact of hydrated lime
   (ILL) on the cracking performance of asphalt mixtures for a broad range
   of aggregate types, including granites and limestones. A recently
   developed conditioning procedure, long-term oven aging (LTOA) plus
   cyclic pore pressure conditioning (CPPC), was employed to simulate the
   effects of long-term field aging on asphalt mixtures. The energy ratio
   (ER) approach, which took into account mixture properties that were
   known to be closely related to cracking and was calibrated with cores
   taken from field-aged pavements throughout Florida, was used to evaluate
   the cracking performance of untreated and lime-treated mixtures. The
   results show that the introduction of ILL appeared to mitigate the
   detrimental effects of oxidative aging and moisture (LTOA plus CPPC) on
   the damage and fracture-related properties of granite and limestone
   mixtures. This effect resulted in better cracking performance of these
   mixtures. Further analysis based on comparison of initial construction
   costs of conventional pavement structures revealed that the use of HL
   could result in lower costs to achieve pavements with the same level of
   good performance. Furthermore, this research showed that the equivalent
   ER criterion proposed and implemented in the cost analysis could
   effectively assess the impact of HL modification.}},

Abstract = {{The no-slip boundary condition is known to produce stress and velocity
   singularity at the moving contact line. Recent molecular dynamics
   simulations have shown that this is not the case, rather in the vicinity
   of the contact line velocity slip is observed, with the contact line
   undergoing perfect slip. It is known that velocity slip is often
   accompanied by thermal slip, resulting in a temperature jump at the
   interface. The degree of thermal slip is defined by Kapitza length which
   is analogous to slip length and is of the same order of magnitude as it.
   It has been recently shown that the standard Navier and Maxwell's
   velocity slip model is not sufficient to capture slip in the vicinity of
   moving contact line. Here we first present a universal velocity slip
   model and then explore using molecular dynamics simulations, the extent
   of thermal slip in the vicinity of the contact line and the impact it
   has on nano-/micro-fluidic applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a real time selective harmonic elimination technique
   for the current of the active rectifier. The partial derivation
   technique is applied to the Fourier series equations of voltage
   waveforms to implement real time SHE technique. In order to control the
   magnitude and phase of the low order current harmonics of the active
   rectifier, a new controller is proposed to fully mitigate the 5th and
   7th current harmonic orders of the active rectifier even with the
   influence of grid voltage harmonics. Moreover, in this paper, an
   asymmetric voltage waveform will be employed to control both the
   magnitude and phase of the current harmonics of the active rectifier.
   The proposed technique needs very low memory storage for look-up tables,
   so it saves a lot of resources for DSP. Finally, the proposed technique
   is verified by MATLAB/Simulink simulations and experiments. The
   technique can be extended to eliminate more orders of harmonics.}},

Abstract = {{The discrete Fourier transform is an important tool for processing
   digital images Efficient algorithms for computing the Fourier transform
   are known as fast Fourier transforms (FFTs). One of the most common of
   these is the Cooley-Tukey radix-2 decimation algorithm that efficiently
   transforms one-dimensional data into its frequency domain
   representation. The orthogonality of rectangular sampling allows the
   separability of the Fourier kernel which enables the use of the
   Cooley-Tukey algorithm on two-dimensional digital images that have been
   sampled rectangularly. Hexagonal sampling provides many benefits over
   rectangular sampling, but it does not result in the orthogonal rows and
   columns that can be transformed independently as is done with
   rectangular samples. Use of the Array Set Addressing (ASA) coordinate
   system for hexagonally sampled images has been shown to provide a
   separable Fourier kernel, leading to an efficient FFT, however its
   implementation is composed of nonstandard transforms that require custom
   routines to evaluate. This work develops a hexagonal FFT in ASA
   coordinates that uses only the standard Fourier transform, allowing the
   user to implement the hexagonal FFT using standard FFT routines.}},

Abstract = {{While online social networks provide access to a massive information
   source, they also enable wide dissemination of false or inaccurate
   content. Undesirable results caused by misinformation propagation make
   its timely detection very imperative. An important question is how many
   monitors are required to detect all misinformation cascades at their
   early stage.
   To answer this question, we define a Time Constrained Misinformation
   Detection (TCMD) problem. As we have proved, there is no polynomial time
   (1 - epsilon) In n-approximation for the TCMD problem. The large number
   of independent misinformation cascades and heterogeneous delays make
   misinformation detection more challenging. Our approach includes
   stochastic programming and an O(ln(1 + n)) approximation algorithm for
   one-hop detection. This approach can provide a lower bound on the number
   of required monitors for general detection. Furthermore, we propose a
   network-compression based solution, whose effectiveness is validated by
   extensive experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{The wide usage of hardware Intellectual Property (IP) cores and software
   programs from untrusted vendors have raised security concerns for system
   designers. Existing solutions for detecting and preventing software
   attacks do not usually consider the presence of malicious logic in
   hardware. Similarly, hardware solutions for detecting Trojans and/or
   design backdoors do not consider the software running on it. Formal
   methods provide powerful solutions in detecting malicious behaviors in
   both hardware and software. However, they suffer from scalability issues
   and cannot be easily used for large-scale computer systems. To alleviate
   the scalability challenge, we propose a new integrated formal
   verification framework to evaluate the trust of computer systems
   constructed from untrusted third-party software and hardware resources.
   This framework combines an automated model checker with an interactive
   theorem prover for proving system-level security properties. We evaluate
   a vulnerable program executed on a bare metal LEON3 SPARC V8 processor
   and prove system security with considerable reduction in effort. Our
   method systematically reduces the effort required for verifying the
   program running on the System-on-Chip (SoC) compared to traditional

Abstract = {{Modeling student learning during tutorial interaction is a central
   problem in intelligent tutoring systems. While many modeling techniques
   have been developed to address this problem, most of them focus on
   cognitive models in conjunction with often-complex domain models. This
   paper presents an analysis suggesting that observing students'
   multimodal behaviors may provide deep insight into student learning at
   critical moments in a tutorial session. In particular, this work
   examines student facial expression, electrodermal activity, posture, and
   gesture immediately following inference questions posed by human tutors.
   The findings show that for human-human task-oriented tutorial dialogue,
   facial expression and skin conductance response following tutor
   inference questions are highly predictive of student learning gains.
   These findings suggest that with multimodal behavior data, intelligent
   tutoring systems can make more informed adaptive decisions to support
   students effectively.}},

Abstract = {{A noise-cancelling sturdy multi-stage noise-shaping (NC-SMASH) structure
   that cancels first stage quantization error is proposed. Without any
   modification to existing analog blocks in the traditional sturdy MASH
   (SMASH) structure, adding digital noise-cancelling filters (NCFs) will
   cancel the first stage quantization error. This quantization error
   cancellation, unlike the traditional MASH structure, is less sensitive
   to analog loop filter matching and digital filters. This is because the
   leakage of the first stage quantization error is shaped by the overall
   noise transfer function (NTF) of the proposed NC-SMASH structure.
   Therefore, this technique allows using low gain opamps without
   signal-to-noise ratio degradation and reducing the number of the first
   stage quantization levels. Detailed Matlab simulation results are

Abstract = {{This paper presents a multi-stage noise-shaping (MASH) delta-sigma
   modulator (DSM) using a back-end digital integrator in the first stage
   of the MASH DSM. By using the back-end digital integrator in the first
   stage, not only can the resolution of the first stage be improved, but
   the opamp dc gain requirement can also be relaxed. A new structure is
   proposed which avoids the need for quantization noise extraction
   digital-to-analog converters (DACs) when using the back-end digital
   integrator. Applying the proposed scheme, 3-level first stage quantizer
   will effectively operate as a 15 level quantizer, and accordingly the
   quantization noise leakage can be reduced. Detailed MATIAB simulation
   results and mathematical analysis are provided to prove the efficiency
   of the proposed structure.}},

Abstract = {{A nanomachined ferromagnetic and non-ferromagnetic superlattice approach
   is used for tunable radio frequency (RF) conductors, where the current
   flow profile through the volume of the conductor is magnetically
   manipulated and so is the RF resistance. The magnetically tunable
   nano-superlattice conductors with a variable ohmic resistance in GHz
   range are successfully demonstrated. The realized superlattice conductor
   consists of an alternating 20 layers of Cu/Ni and Cu/NiFe thin films
   with a thickness of each pair of 150 nm/25 nm where 150 nm is a few
   times smaller than the skin depth of Cu in the frequency range of
   interest. As a total multi-layer conductor's thickness of 1.75 11m has
   shown to have a reverse RF resistance performance as a function of
   frequency compared to its solid Cu counterpart with the same thickness,
   we call this artificial conductor as the ``metaconductor{''}. In 10 MHz
   - 20 GHz frequency range, the metaconductors show an increased ohmic
   resistance in less than 10 GHz, but a reduced ohmic resistance in
   greater than 10 GHz range as ``low loss conductors{''} in especially Ku
   and K bands. The RF frequency showing maximum resistance is magnetically
   tunable by more than 700 \% (1 GHz similar to 7 GHz).}},

   inductors made of hybrid cylindrical radial superlattice (h-CRS)
   conductors with a gold core featuring ultra-high quality factor
   (Q-factor) in ultra wideband (UWB) and K-bands. A CRS conductor is made
   of paired Cu/NiFe layers with a thickness of each pair of 150 nm/25 nm,
   respectively, using a DC/RF sputtering thin film deposition process. The
   negative permeability of NiFe thin films above their ferromagnetic
   resonance frequency is used to cancel the eddy currents inside
   conductors and reduce the conductor loss in Ku and K-bands. The
   directional thin film deposition aspect of the used fabrication method
   for the CRS conductors results in a hybrid conductor structure
   comprising both solid and multi-layer superlattice parts leading to
   dual-band high-Q characteristics in UWB and K bands. The intrinsic
   radial shape of the utilized CRS conductors with the uniform and closed
   boundaries make them superior for the super compact RF low loss
   conductors. In result of using CRS conductors with ultra-thin layers and
   the air-lifted structure with suppressed dielectric losses, a

Abstract = {{The capabilities of autonomy have grown to encompass new application
   spaces that until recently were considered exclusive to humans. In the
   past, automation has focused on applications where it was preferable to
   completely replace the human. Today, though, we have the opportunity to
   leverage the complementary strengths of both human and autonomy
   technologies to maximize performance and limit risk, and the human
   should therefore remain ``in{''} or ``on{''} the loop. To adequately
   assess when and how to accomplish this, it requires us to assess not
   only the capabilities, but the risks and the ethical questions; coupled
   to this are the issues with degradation of performance in specific
   instances (for instance, recovery from failure) that may require a human
   to remain the sole control authority. This paper investigates the
   contributors to success/failure in current human-autonomy integration
   frameworks, and proposes guidelines for safe and resilient use of humans
   and autonomy with regard to performance, consequence, and the stability
   of human-machine switching. Key to our proposed approach are (i) the
   relative error rate between the human and autonomy and (ii) the
   consequence of possible events.}},

Abstract = {{Online social networks have been one of the most effective platforms for
   marketing and advertising. Through the ``world-of-mouth{''} exchanges,
   so-called viral marketing, the influence and product adoption can spread
   from few key influencers to billions of users in the network. To
   identify those key influencers, a great amount of work has been devoted
   for the Influence Maximization (IM) problem that seeks a set of k seed
   users that maximize the expected influence. Unfortunately, IM encloses
   two impractical assumptions: 1) any seed user can be acquired with the
   same cost and 2) all users are equally interested in the advertisement.
   In this paper, we propose a new problem, called Cost-aware Targeted
   Viral Marketing (CTVM), to find the most cost-effective seed users who
   can influence the most relevant users to the advertisement. Since CTVM
   is NP-hard, we design an efficient (1 - 1 /root e - C)-approximation
   algorithm, named BCT, to solve the problem in billion-scale networks.
   Comparing with IM algorithms, we show that BCT is both theoretically and
   experimentally faster than the state-of-the-arts while providing better
   solution quality. Moreover, we prove that under the Linear Threshold
   model, BCT is the first sub-linear time algorithm for CTVM (and IM) in
   dense networks. In our experiments with a Twitter dataset, containing
   1.46 billions of social relations and 106 millions tweets, BCT can
   identify key influencers in each trending topic in only few minutes.}},

Abstract = {{Information propagation in online social networks (OSNs), which helps
   shaping consumers' purchasing decisions, has received a lot of
   attention. The ultimate goal of marketing and advertising in OSNs is to
   massively influence audiences and enlarge the number of product
   adoptions. Most of existing works focus on maximizing the influence of a
   single product or promoting the adoption of one product in competing
   campaigns. However, in reality, the majority of companies produce
   various products for supplying customers with different needs.
   Therefore, it is truly significant and also challenging to wisely
   distribute limited budget across multiple products in viral marketing.
   In this paper, we investigate a Profit Maximization with Multiple
   Adoptions (PM(2)A) problem, which aims at maximizing the overall profit
   across all products. The natural greedy fails to provide a bounded
   result. In order to select high quality seeds for information
   propagation, we first proposed the PMCE algorithm, which has a ratio 1/2
   (1 - 1/e(2)). Moreover, we further improve this ratio to (1- 1/e) by
   proposing the PMIS algorithm. Comprehensive experiments on three real
   social networks are conducted. And results show that our algorithms
   outperform other heuristics, and better distribute the budget in terms
   of profit maximization.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic carbon composites (MCs) have received great interest in areas
   such as environmental remediation, catalyst supports and carriers for
   drug delivery systems. In order to improve the porosity of the MCs, the
   catalytic mechanism of iron salts during CO2 activation of hydrochar was
   systematically investigated using a suite of methods including Mossbauer
   spectroscopy, on-line pyrolysis gases and porosity analysis. Fe3O4 and
   superparamagnetic alpha-Fe2O3(s), pyrolysis products of iron salts, were
   found to promote the reaction between carbon and CO2 gas, leading to a
   decrease in the activation temperature that is required for optimal
   porosity. However, the reduction reaction between iron oxide and carbon
   was completely inhibited by CO2 gas. FeCl3 enhanced the thermal cracking
   of hydrochar and increased the porosity of the MCs in terms of an
   improvement of the amount of H-2, namely the pore-creating effect.
   However, other iron salts showed adverse effects, due to their
   inhibition effects on the thermal cracking of hydrochar. The MCs with
   excellent porosities showed high adsorption capacities for
   pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), and were negatively
   correlated with the melting points of the PPCPs. The findings from this
   work can guide the production of novel MCs for maximum removal
   performance of organic pollutants from the environment.}},

Abstract = {{Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology has been widely adopted
   by real-world industries. This paper presents a new application for
   distributively deployed RFID systems, wherein a user chooses multiple
   tag sets at will from different spatial or temporal domains, and then
   connects them by set operators (union, intersection and relative
   complement) to form a set expression. The user is allowed to query for
   the cardinality of an arbitrary set expression, which is called the
   joint property of multiple sets. We focus on the problem of estimating
   the joint property with bounded error, which has many potential
   applications. One of them is to allow users to check the number of tags
   in an arbitrary tag flow passing through a distributed RFID system. For
   this problem, we propose a solution with a novel design that supports
   versatile snapshot construction: Given the snapshots of multiple tag
   sets, although their lengths may be very different, our formulas can
   estimate their joint properties, with an accuracy that can be
   arbitrarily set. For the proposed estimator, we formally analyze its
   bias and variance, and also the optimal settings of protocol parameters
   to minimize the time cost of taking a snapshot of a tag set. The
   simulation results show that, under predefined accuracy requirement, our
   solution can reduce time cost by multiple folds as compared with
   existing works named DiffEstm and CCF, which require all tag sets must
   be encoded into snapshots with an equal length.}},

Abstract = {{Au Photoacoustic molecular imaging (PAI) is a novel biomedical imaging
   technique that utilize ultrasonic signal as an information carrier. PAI
   provides optical absorption and dielectric properties relevanted
   physiology and pathology at the cellular and molecular level through the
   use of exogenous contrast agents. These contrast agents can generate
   strong photoacoustic (PA) signal and provide contrast enhancement. In
   addition, they can be conjugated with molecular probes for targeted
   early detection and treatment of cancers. Here we review the new
   exogenous contrast agents in recent years from five types, including
   dyes, plasmonic nanostructure, various new class nanoparticles and
   multimodality contrast agents. At last we conduct a further outlook of
   the application prospects in the field of biomedicine.}},

Abstract = {{Saliency measures are a popular way to predict visual attention.
   However, saliency is normally tested on sets of single resolution images
   that are unlike what the human vision system sees. We propose a new
   saliency measure based on convolving images with 2D gamma kernels which
   function as a comparison between a center and a surrounding
   neighborhood. The two parameters in the gamma kernel provide an ideal
   way to change the size of both the center and the surrounding
   neighborhood, which makes finding saliency at different scales simple
   and fast. We test the new saliency measure on both the CAT2000 database
   and the Toronto database and compare the results with other simple
   saliency methods. In addition, we test the methods on a foveated version
   of the Toronto database to test whether these methods perform well in a
   fixation system similar to the human vision system. Gamma saliency is
   shown to both perform better and compute faster than the competing
   methods in both the standard databases and the foveated version.}},

   set registration. Firstly, a modified version of shape context (SC) is
   developed, which is invariant to rigid transformation and flipping. With
   the point correspondence obtained by the modified SC, an affine
   transformation based on the maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) is
   performed on the query shape. This point set registration could be
   further refined by non-rigid morphing with the minimization of
   Cauchy-Schwarz divergence (DCS). Not only does this information
   theoretical learning (ITL) approach renders excellent registration
   result, but a new shape similarity measure can also be derived from the
   registration.}},

Abstract = {{Inherent stochastic physical mechanisms in emerging nonvolatile memories
   (NVMs), such as resistive random-access-memory (RRAM), have recently
   been explored for hardware security applications. Unlike the
   conventional silicon Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) that are
   solely based on manufacturing process variation, RRAM has some intrinsic
   randomness in its physical mechanisms that can be utilized as entropy
   sources; for instance, resistance variation, random telegraph noise, and
   probabilistic switching behaviors. This paper reviews the challenges and
   opportunities in building security primitives with emerging devices. In

Abstract = {{To meet energy and quality of service (QoS) constraints in
   consumer/user-based embedded devices (CEDs), configurable caches can be
   tuned to a best configuration that consumes the least amount of energy
   while adhering to QoS expectations. However, due to disparate consumer
   QoS expectations and a myriad of unknown, third-party CED applications,
   tuning caches in CEDs is very challenging. In this paper, we propose a
   quality of service-aware, scalable tuning algorithm for configurable
   caches, which requires no a priori knowledge of applications or
   design-time efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Capacitance-voltage (C-V) and current-voltage (I-V) characteristics and

   metallorganic chemical vapor deposition on semi-insulating 4H-SiC
   substrates and comprised of an AlGaN barrier and GaN(Fe) semi-insulating
   buffer with the upper (similar to 100 nm) portion unintentionally doped
   and lightly n-type. The C-V measurements were performed in the 85-400 K
   range in the dark and showed a decrease in the threshold voltage for
   temperatures higher than 200 K. The change was most prominent for
   temperatures from 290 K to similar to 330 K and occured due to deep
   traps capturing electrons in the AlGaN barrier and near the AlGaN/GaN
   interface. C-V measurements at low temperature showed that the traps in
   the AlGaN barrier are located near E-c-2 eV and have a density of
   similar to 10(12) cm(-2), while the traps at the interface have an
   optical ionization threshold near 1.7 eV and the density of similar to 4
   x 10(12) cm(-2). Capacitance deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS)
   and current DLTS (CDLTS) revealed electron traps with levels near
   E-c-0.56 eV and hole traps with levels near E-v+0.9 eV and E-v+0.5 eV.
   The E-c-0.56 eV traps are known to be located near the AlGaN/GaN
   interface in the GaN buffer. The E-v+0.9 eV hole traps are located in
   the buffer. (C) 2016 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by

   centromedian-parafascicular complex (CM-PF) and subdural strips over the
   precentral gyrus. Low-frequency (1-10 Hz) CM-PF activity was observed
   during tics, as well as modulations in beta rhythms over the motor
   cortex. Tics were divided into three categories: long complex, complex,
   and simple. Long complex tics, tics involving multiple body regions and
   lasting longer than 5 s, were concurrent with a highly detectable
   thalamocortical signature (average recall {[}sensitivity] 88.6\%,
   average precision 96.3\%). Complex tics were detected with an average
   recall of 63.9\% and precision of 36.6\% and simple tics an average

Abstract = {{Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) were introduced over a decade ago
   for a variety of security applications. Silicon PUFs exploit
   uncontrollable random variations from manufacturing to generate unique
   and random signatures/responses. Existing research on PUFs has focused
   on either PUF design at the architectural level or optimization of
   lithography to increase sensitivity to random process variations.
   however, such sources of randomness may become limited during standard
   CMOS manufacturing as processes continue to mature especially with the
   advances in design for manufacturability. In this paper, poly-Si is
   proposed to improve PUF quality at the materials level. Compared to
   conventional single crystal Si (sc-Si), defects and trapped charges
   resulting from the random distribution of crystal grains and grain
   boundaries (GBs) in poly-Si offer considerable random variations. By
   using poly-Si only in the PUF region in devices, the randomness of the
   PUF can be enhanced without impacting other functional circuits and thus
   the IC yield can be maintained. RO-PUF simulation results based on a
   poly-Si field-effect-transistor (FET) model show that compared to sc-Si
   based PUFs, the reliability of poly-Si based PUFS can be improved from
   89.18\% to 98.82\%.}},

Abstract = {{Hardware Trojan detection has emerged as a critical challenge to ensure
   security and trustworthiness of integrated circuits. A vast majority of
   research efforts in this area has utilized side-channel analysis for
   Trojan detection. Functional test generation for logic testing is a
   promising alternative but it may not be helpful if a Trojan cannot be
   fully activated or the Trojan effect cannot be propagated to the
   observable outputs. Side-channel analysis, on the other hand, can
   achieve significantly higher detection coverage for Trojans of all
   types/sizes, since it does not require activation/propagation of an
   unknown Trojan. However, they have often limited effectiveness due to
   poor detection sensitivity under large process variations and small
   Trojan footprint in side-channel signature. In this paper, we address
   this critical problem through a novel side-channel-aware test generation
   approach, based on a concept of Multiple Excitation of Rare Switching
   (MERS), that can significantly increase Trojan detection sensitivity.
   The paper makes several important contributions: i) it presents in
   detail the statistical test generation method, which can generate
   high-quality testset for creating high relative activity in arbitrary
   Trojan instances; ii) it analyzes the effectiveness of generated testset
   in terms of Trojan coverage; and iii) it describes two judicious
   reordering methods can further tune the testset and greatly improve the
   side channel sensitivity. Simulation results demonstrate that the tests
   generated by MERS can significantly increase the Trojans sensitivity,
   thereby making Trojan detection effective using side-channel analysis.}},

   to target features. Registration of density functions is particularly
   popular. In contrast to the success enjoyed by the density function
   representation, we have not seen similar success with the signed
   distance function representation. Resonant deformable matching (RDM)
   simultaneously estimates a non-rigid deformation and a set of unknown
   target normal directions by registering fields comprising signed
   distance and probability density information. Resonance occurs as the
   reconstruction estimate comes into agreement with the registered
   template. We perform experiments probing two problems: point-set
   registration and normal estimation. RDM compares favorably to top tier
   point registration and graph algorithms in terms of registration and

Abstract = {{Transportation infrastructure management systems (TIMS) are used to
   model the performance and preservation of transportation infrastructure.
   The decision and optimization tools used in many of the traditional TIMS
   are based on Markov decision processes (MDP). The Markov decision
   process has a `memoryless' property, which assumes that the sojourn
   times in each state are exponential. This study looks at a decision and
   optimization tool that is based on semi-Markov decision processes
   (SMDP), which is less restrictive than the MDP counterpart. The Weibull
   distribution was the assumed distribution of the sojourn time in each
   condition state. The maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the Weibull
   distribution parameters were determined based on historical condition
   data. In the SMDP model, dynamic programming was used to determine the
   optimal long-term maintenance and rehabilitation costs for bridge
   elements in particular condition states, which was compared against the
   traditional MDP. The results obtained from this study indicated that the
   SMDP model is feasible and is a more flexible model than the traditional
   MDP model for modeling the preservation of transportation
   infrastructure.}},

   calculate two-phase slug flow pressure drop in microchannels through a
   sudden contraction. Even though many studies have been reported on
   two-phase flow in microchannels, considerable discrepancies still exist,
   mainly due to the difficulties in experimental setup and measurements.
   Numerical simulations were performed to support the new analytical
   models and to explore in more detail the physics of the flow in
   microchannels with a sudden contraction. Both analytical and numerical
   results were compared to the available experimental data and other
   empirical correlations. Results show that models, which were developed
   based on the slug and semi-slug assumptions, agree well with experiments
   in microchannels. Moreover, in contrast to the previous empirical
   correlations which were tuned for a specific geometry, the new
   analytical models are capable of taking geometrical parameters as well
   as flow conditions into account.}},

Abstract = {{The Al-Mg electrodeposition is investigated using the
   organometallic-based electrolyte:
   Na{[}AlEt4]+2Na{[}Et3Al-H-AlEt3]+2.5AlEt(3)+6toluene (Et =-C2H5),
   employing Mg anode. With an increase of Mg in the deposit the
   predominant morphology and its composition changes from ground (90-95
   atom\% Al) to smooth globules (75-80 atom\% Al) to rough globules (15-45
   atom\% Al). The ground and smooth globules possessed face centered cubic
   (fcc) Al(+Mg) phase and the rough globules possess hexagonal close
   packed (hcp) Mg(+Al) phase. The overall composition (atom\% Al-the more
   noble metal) of the deposits is less than that of the electrolyte, and
   increases steeply with a slight change in the latter. This indicates the
   absence of preferred deposition of the more noble metal suggesting the
   anomalous electrodeposition of Al-Mg. A critical ratio of Al/Mg exists
   in the electrolyte beyond which the anomalousness is enhanced. This
   critical ratio is identified by the onset of hcp Mg(+Al) phase formation
   in the deposits. A lack of trend in the overall deposit composition with
   electrolyte agitation affirms the anomalous electrodeposition of Al-Mg

Abstract = {{At the seacoast in a coastal aquifer, freshwater from inland terrestrial
   sources discharges to the sea, flowing over denser seawater from marine
   sources that intrudes inland along the base of the aquifer. As the
   seawater flows inland, it mixes with the seaward flowing freshwater, is
   recirculated, and discharges back to the sea. The sum of the
   recirculated seawater and fresh groundwater discharge is called
   submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). Recirculated seawater can be a
   major component of SGD, affecting the salinity of the SGD discharged
   into coastal and estuarine systems. Based on dimensional analysis, three
   dimensionless ratios (L-D, R-D, and P-R) that represent saltwater
   intrusion, the recirculation of seawater, and the percent of
   recirculated seawater that is contained in the SGD can be considered
   dependent variables in this problem. Two additional dimensionless ratios
   (a(z) and r(K)) that represent the ratio of the freshwater inflow
   relative to the vertical density-driven buoyancy flux and the ratio of
   the vertical and horizontal hydraulic conductivities in the aquifer
   cross-section can be considered independent variables in this problem.
   Numerical experiments were conducted using SEAWAT to determine how L-D,
   R-D, and P-R are related to a(z) and r(K) over a wide range of values of
   a(z) = 0.1 to 10.0 and r(K) = 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0. Based on the results
   of this investigation, L-D, R-D, and PR all increase as az and rK are
   decreased, and L-D, R-D, and PR all decrease to zero or near zero as az
   and rK are increased. Maximum values of L-D, R-D, and P-R occur at a(z)
   = 0.1 for r(K) = 0.01, and minimum values of L-D, R-D, and PR occur at
   a(z) = 10.0 for r(K) = 1.0. The maximum value of P-R = 74.1 \% at a(z) =
   0.1 and r(K) = 0.01 confirms the important contribution that
   recirculated seawater can make to SGD and its effect on increasing the
   salinity of SGD in a vertically anisotropic aquifer, particularly at
   relatively small values of a(z) similar to 0.1. The minimum values for
   L-D, R-D, and P-R, which approach zero and occur at the larger values of
   az, indicate that saltwater intrusion and the recirculation of seawater
   are significantly reduced in both isotropic and anisotropic aquifers at
   relatively large values of a(z) similar to 10.0. In natural settings,
   aquifer properties such as horizontal and vertical hydraulic
   conductivities, aquifer thickness, freshwater inflows, and other
   properties can be quite variable. However, based on the results of this
   investigation, saltwater intrusion, the recirculation of seawater, and
   the percent of recirculated seawater in submarine groundwater discharge
   in such field-scale aquifers can be investigated and even predicted by
   quantifying the two independent dimensionless ratios a(z) and r(K).}},

Abstract = {{DebriSat is an ongoing project that will address the orbital debris
   dilemma by providing new data to update existing orbital impact breakup
   models. Currently, the project is in the post-impact phase. During this
   phase, debris generated from the hypervelocity impact phase of the
   project will be extracted, measured, logged, and characterized. The
   amount of data generated by the characterization of this data is massive
   and will only continue to increase. To address the challenge of managing
   this overwhelming amount of data, a data management infrastructure is
   created, consisting of a back-end data management service and a
   front-end user interface. This paper will discuss the process of
   designing and developing this data management infrastructure. This paper
   will also describe some of the challenges encountered during and after
   development of the infrastructure and how these challenges were
   approached and eventually solved. This paper aims to use the design of
   this data management system and the pitfalls encountered during its
   development to provide the community with a precedence and framework for
   addressing big data challenges similar to those posed by DebriSat.}},

Abstract = {{The demand for improved visibility in hostile environments requires
   materials with high transparency and superior impact resistance.
   Numerous materials satisfy the above requirements including transparent
   polymers (PMMA), polycrystalline glass ceramics (e.g., AlON, spinels,
   transparent Al2O3), single crystals sapphire, hardened glass, etc. In
   this study, an investigation into fracture behavior and fragmentation
   characteristics of three different classes of transparent materials,
   namely, single crystal sapphire, polycrystalline magnesium aluminate
   spinel, and amorphous strengthened glass with high residual surface
   compressive stress exceeding 1 GPa. The materials were examined to
   better understand the operative damage mechanisms during quasistatic and
   dynamic loading. Due to their inherently different structural features,
   the mechanisms of deformation under static and dynamic loads are vastly
   different. While high hardness has been considered as a dominant
   property that contributes to superior performance of any armor material,
   it is now recognized that it is not the only property that determines
   the resistance against an incoming projectile. A range of mechanisms
   including the tendency for mixed mode fracture, grain boundary
   shielding, and pulverization characteristics etc., act in favor of
   spinel, whereas propensity for fracture along preferred crystallographic
   planes contributes to inferior performance of sapphire. In the case of
   strengthened glass, large residual compressive stresses (up to 1 GPa)
   enable increased impact resistance. Finally, the energy dissipated in
   each of these failure modes is quantified to gain further insight into
   the mechanics of failure in these materials.}},

Abstract = {{Selective Harmonic Elimination PWM (SHE-PWM) method has slow dynamic
   response, due to using the Fourier transform before the Look-Up Tables
   (LUTs) in practices. Also, in some cases, the SHE-PWM cannot find any
   solutions in normal modulation ranges. On the other hand, Phase-Shift
   PWM (PSPWM) does not need Fourier transform in practice to operate, but
   it has lower efficiency than SHE-PWM. Furthermore, the PSPWM can work
   properly in all of the normal modulation indices. Using the combination
   of these two methods can achieve high efficiency and fast dynamic
   response at the same time. Moreover, the inverter can work in all of the
   normal modulation indices. To reach these goals, a hybrid Selective
   Harmonic Elimination PWM with Phase-Shift Pulse Width Modulation
   (HSHE-PSPWM) is introduced by applying SHE-PWM in steady state condition
   and applying PSPWM in dynamic conditions. Also, for some modulation
   indices that the SHE-PWM does not have any solutions, the PSPWM has been
   applied to the Cascaded H-Bridge (CHB) inverter. A controller is also
   proposed to switch between the SHE-PWM and PSPWM. Also, a RLC low pass
   filter is designed to attenuate high order harmonics of the proposed
   HSHE-PSPWM and it will be shown that the proposed technique can fully
   meet the IEEE-519 2014 in steady state and transient conditions.
   Finally, to verify the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed
   method, simulation and experimental results are obtained from a 7-level
   Cascaded H-Bridge inverter.}},

Abstract = {{Phosphate processing plants produce an excessive amount of phosphatic
   clay. This clay represents a serious environmental problem due to their
   disposal in huge ponds. Finding a feasible method to reduce the clay
   disposal area is needed. Although the flocculation process, in the
   presence of fibrous material, seems to be a good dewatering process for
   phosphatic clay wastes, the maximum solid percentage of flocculated clay
   does not exceed 18\% (starting from 3 to 4\%). Recently, the microwave
   proved a better performance in several research areas as compared to the
   conventional drying. In this study, clay dewatering by microwave was
   investigated. Several factors affecting the dewatering process were
   studied such as heating time, microwave power efficiency, and fiber
   percentage. Using the microwave, the solid content significantly
   increases in a reasonably short time. The time and power are the most
   significant among the studied factors. In addition, sand-clay mix was
   tested to improve the solid percentage to be used as a filling material.
   The results showed that the presence of sand enhances the clay drying
   due to the transparency of sand to the microwave irradiation as well as
   increasing the clay bed porosity, which facilitates migration of liquid
   water and/or water vapor toward the surface of dried material.}},

Abstract = {{Landmine detection methods face the challenging task of discriminating a
   wide variety of targets in a diverse array of environmental conditions.
   As a result, successful approaches often utilize multiple sensing
   modalities and algorithms in order to overcome the limitations of any
   one particular approach. The development of complementary approaches is
   often motivated by a reductionist view, which reduces a detector's
   overall limitations to its limitations within particular contexts.
   However, when a detector is evaluated on a diverse data set, a new
   source of error arises that is not reflected in its performance within
   the contexts in isolation, which we refer to as mis-calibration error.
   Mis-calibration occurs when the true likelihood of target presence
   conditioned on a detector's output significantly varies across different
   contexts. In this work, we demonstrate the effect of context-dependent
   mis-calibration first on a hypothetical detector and then on four
   different landmine detection methods. To eliminate error due to
   mis-calibration, we propose a strategy called context-dependent score
   calibration (CDSC), which uses a monotonic calibration approach that
   maximizes the AUC (area under the ROC curve) of the calibrated output.
   We then show the gain in observed performance achieved on a diverse
   dataset when these four landmine detection algorithms are properly
   calibrated across the different contexts.}},

   experiment was then conducted to verify the results drawn from the
   analytical models. Results show that, compared with the status quo, the
   reservation service can improve the performance of the parking system,
   while providing information may not. The former is proved to be a better
   policy than the latter for the parking competition setting and search
   behaviors considered in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Piggyback is an effective scheme to transmit control messages in
   wireless local area networks (WLANs). In traditional approaches, the
   piggyback scheme is achieved by redefining or adding control fields in
   the MAC frame header, i.e., MAC layer piggyback scheme. However, this
   method has shortcomings. In this paper, we design and present PhyPig
   (Physical Piggyback), a cross-layer design for lightweight control
   channel. In the newly proposed communication strategy, the control
   messages are piggybacked on OFDM-based physical layer so that PhyPig
   does not consume extra channel resources, and does not harm the normal
   data throughput. Specifically, PhyPig modulates control messages (or
   sequences of binary bits) into null or non-null (i.e., normal) data
   symbols, the minimum 2-D time-frequency resource unit in OFDM. The
   thus-transmitted messages can be interpreted by checking the patterns of
   data symbols on OFDM subcarriers. Our extensive results validate the
   feasibility of PhyPig and show that PhyPig delivers control messages
   with close to 100\% accuracy on a channel with practical SNR regions.
   Further, based on our simulation results, we demonstrate that PhyPig
   outperforms traditional piggyback scheme with significant performance
   improvements in different scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Self-healing polymers and composites utilizing the Diels-Alder reaction
   have received considerable attention due to the intrinsic healing
   capability of this crosslink. However past research focused on
   chemistries that cleave at low temperatures, which places limitations on
   the polymer's use temperature. Here, it is demonstrated that the
   crosslinking Diels-Alder (DA) reaction between anthracene and maleimide
   moieties can be used to achieve healing efficiencies greater than 94\%
   for polymers and 69\% for carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites
   while remaining stable beyond 240 degrees C. It is shown that the
   self-healing behavior can be obtained purely through the reformation of
   mechanically cleaved DA adducts since the cleaving temperature is beyond
   the decomposition temperature. The self-healing polymer reported here is
   obtained from liquid monomers allowing the polymerization of bulk
   polymer samples and its infusion into continuous fiber reinforced
   composites. It is shown that the polymer can yield thermally stable
   composites with mechanical properties comparable to those of other
   engineering polymers and structural composites.}},

Journal = {{POLYMER CHEMISTRY}},

Abstract = {{Boronic acid-functionalized (co)polymers have gained increasing
   attention in the field of responsive polymers and polymeric materials
   due to their unique characteristics and responsiveness towards both
   changes in pH and sugar concentrations. This makes these (co)polymers
   excellently suited for various applications including responsive
   membranes, drug delivery applications and sensor materials.
   Unfortunately, boronic acid-based polymer research is also notorious for
   its challenging monomer synthesis and polymerization and its overall
   difficult polymer purification and manipulation. In light of this, many
   research groups have focused their attention on the optimization of
   various polymerization techniques in order to expand the field of
   BA-research including previously unexplored monomers and polymerization
   techniques. In this paper, a new post-polymerization modification
   methodology was developed allowing for the synthesis of novel boronic
   acid-decorated poly(2-alkyl-2-oxazoline) (PAOx) copolymers, utilizing
   the recently published PAOx methyl ester reaction platform. The
   developed synthetic pathway provides a straightforward method for the
   introduction of pH- and glucose-responsiveness, adding this to the
   already wide variety of possible responsive PAOx-based systems. The
   synthesized BA-decorated PAOx are based on the thermoresponsive
   poly(2-n-propyl-2-oxazoline) (PnPropOx). This introduces a pH and
   glucose dependence on both cloud and clearance point temperatures of the
   copolymer in aqueous and pH-buffered conditions, yielding a
   triply-responsive (co)polymer that highlights the wide variety of
   obtainable properties using this pathway.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene paper has diverse applications in printed circuit board
   electronics, bioassays, 3D cell culture, and biosensing. Although
   development of nanometal-graphene hybrid composites is commonplace in
   the sensing literature, to date there are only a few examples of
   nanometal-decorated graphene paper for use in biosensing. In this
   manuscript, we demonstrate the synthesis and application of Pt nano
   cauliflower-functionalized graphene paper for use in electrochemical
   biosensing of small molecules (glucose, acetone, methanol) or detection
   of pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli O157:H7). Raman spectroscopy,
   scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy were
   used to show that graphene oxide deposited on nanocellulose crystals was
   partially reduced by both thermal and chemical treatment. Fractal
   platinum nanostructures were formed on the reduced graphene oxide paper,
   producing a conductive paper with an extremely high electroactive
   surface area, confirmed by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy. To show the broad applicability of the material,
   the platinum surface was functionalized with three different
   biomaterials: 1) glucose oxidase (via chitosan encapsulation); 2) a DNA
   aptamer (via covalent linking), or 3) a chemosensory protein (via his
   linking). We demonstrate the application of this device for point of
   care biosensing. The detection limit for both glucose (0.08 +/- 0.02 mu
   M) and E. coli O157:H7 (1.3 +/- 0.1 CFU mL(-1)) were competitive with,
   or superior to, previously reported devices in the biosensing
   literature. The response time (6 sec for glucose and 10 min for E. coli)
   were also similar to silicon biochip and commercial electrode sensors.
   The results demonstrate that the nanocellulose-graphene-nanoplatinum
   material is an excellent paper-based platform for development of
   electrochemical biosensors targeting small molecules or whole cells for
   use in point of care biosensing.}},

Abstract = {{Enhanced interest in wearable biosensor technology over the past decade
   is directly related to the increasing prevalence of diabetes and the
   associated requirement of daily blood glucose monitoring. In this work
   we investigate the platinum-carbon transduction element used in
   traditional first-generation glucose biosensors which rely on the
   concentration of hydrogen peroxide produced by the glucose-glucose
   oxidase binding scheme. We electrodeposit platinum nanoparticles on a
   commercially-available screen printed carbon electrode by stepping an
   applied current between 0 and 7.12 mA/cm(2) for a varying number of
   cycles. Next, we examine the trends in deposition and the effect that
   the number of deposition cycles has on the sensitivity of
   electrochemical glucose sensing. Results from this work indicate that
   applying platinum nanoparticles to screen printed carbon via
   electrodeposition from a metal salt solution improves overall biosensor
   sensitivity. This work also pinpoints the amount of platinum (i.e.,
   number of deposition cycles) that maximizes biosensor sensitivity in an
   effort to minimize the use of the precious metals, viz., platinum, in
   electrode fabrication. In summary, this work quantifies the relationship
   between platinum electrodeposition and sensor performance, which is

Abstract = {{Despite strict regulations to control the presence of human pathogens in
   our food supply, recent foodborne outbreaks have heightened public
   concern about food safety and created urgency to improve methods for
   pathogen detection. Herein we explore a potentially portable, low-cost
   system that uses magnetic microdiscs for the detection of bacterial
   pathogens in liquid samples. The system operates by optically measuring
   the rotational dynamics of suspended magnetic microdiscs functionalized
   with pathogen-binding aptamers. The soft ferromagnetic (Ni80Fe20)
   microdiscs exhibit a closed magnetic spin arrangement (i.e. spin vortex)
   with zero magnetic stray field, leading to no disc agglomeration when in
   free suspension. With very high surface area for functionalization and
   volumes 10,000x larger than commonly used superparamagnetic
   nanoparticles, these 1.5-mu m-diameter microdiscs are well suited for
   tagging, trapping, actuating, or interrogating bacterial targets. This
   work reports a wafer-level microfabrication process for fabrication of
   600 million magnetic microdiscs per substrate and measurement of their
   rotational dynamics response. Additionally, the biofunctionalization of
   the microdiscs with DNA aptamers, subsequent binding to E. coli
   bacteria, and their magnetic manipulation is reported.}},

Abstract = {{Here we demonstrate a novel approach for fabricating point of care (POC)
   wearable electrochemical biosensors based on 3D patterning of
   bionanocomposite networks. To create Bio-Inspired Patterned network
   (BIPS) electrodes, we first generate fractal network in silico models
   that optimize transport of network fluxes according to an energy
   function. Network patterns are then inkjet printed onto flexible
   substrate using conductive graphene ink. We then deposit fractal
   nanometal structures onto the graphene to create a 3D nanocomposite
   network. Finally, we biofunctionalize the surface with biorecognition
   agents using covalent bonding. In this paper, BIPS are used to develop
   high efficiency, low cost biosensors for measuring glucose as a proof of
   concept. Our results on the fundamental performance of BIPS sensors show
   that the biomimetic nanostructures significantly enhance biosensor
   sensitivity, accuracy, response time, limit of detection, and hysteresis
   compared to conventional POC non fractal electrodes (serpentine,
   interdigitated, and screen printed electrodes). BIPs, in particular
   Apollonian patterned BIPS, represent a new generation of POC biosensors
   based on nanoscale and microscale fractal networks that significantly

Abstract = {{Listeria monocytogenes is one of the most common causes of food illness
   deaths worldwide, with multiple outbreaks in the United States alone.
   Current methods to detect foodborne pathogens are laborious and can take
   several hours to days to produce results. Thus, faster techniques are
   needed to detect bacteria within the same reliability level as
   traditional techniques. This study reports on a rapid, accurate, and
   sensitive aptamer biosensor device for Listeria spp. detection based on
   platinum interdigitated array microelectrodes (Pt-IDEs). Pt-IDEs with
   different geometric electrode gaps were fabricated by lithographic
   techniques and characterized by cyclic voltammetric (CV),
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and potential amperometry
   (DCPA) measurements of reversible redox species. Based on these results,
   50 mu m Pt-IDE was chosen to further functionalize with a Listeria
   monocytogenes DNA aptamer selective to the cell surface protein
   internalin A, via metal-thiol self-assembly at the 5' end of the
   47-mer's. EIS analysis was used to detect Listeria spp. without the need
   for label amplification and pre-concentration steps. The optimized
   aptamer concentration of 800 nM was selected to capture the bacteria
   through internalin A binding and the aptamer hairpin structure near the
   3' end. The aptasensor was capable of detecting a wide range of bacteria
   concentration from 10 to 106 CFU/mL at lower detection limit of 5.39 +/-
   0.21 CFU/mL with sensitivity of 268.1 +/- 25.40 (Ohms/log {[}CFU/mL]) in
   17 min. The aptamer based biosensor offers a portable, rapid and
   sensitive alternative for food safety applications with one of the
   lowest detection limits reported to date.}},

Abstract = {{For the past two years, Mechanical \& Aerospace Engineering students at
   the University of Florida have been designing and manufacturing
   impellers for a centrifugal fan. The method is taught in our
   Thermo-Fluids Lab and Design class and involves using Euler's
   Turbomachine Equation and creating velocity diagrams to predict
   performance. A limitation of the Euler Turbomachine Equation is that it
   is based on a finite control volume analysis which prescribes blade
   angles at the entrance and exit of the impeller, but provides no
   information on the number or geometry of the blades within the impeller.
   Another limitation of the equation is that it assumes an infinite number
   of blades of zero thickness that results in uniform flow at the inlet
   and the exit, while a real impeller has a distinct velocity profile in
   between each blade that leads to losses not predicted by the equation. A
   Digital Design Process has evolved whereby students create an initial
   design using the Euler method, and then create a digital model using
   Solidworks, and then follow that up with a computational fluid dynamics
   (CFD) to optimize their design. After optimization, the students
   manufacture a prototype of their impeller using a 3-D printer, and then
   test the impeller in the lab fan performance apparatus. The results of
   their efforts as well as the issues involved in managing such a project
   with about 125 students per semester will be discussed in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Decreased cardiac function after resuscitation from cardiac
   arrest (CA) results from global ischemia of the myocardium. In the
   evolution of postarrest myocardial dysfunction, preferential involvement
   of any coronary arterial territory is not known. We hypothesized that
   there is no preferential involvement of any coronary artery during
   electrical induced ventricular fibrillation (VF) in piglet model.
   Design. Prospective, randomized controlled study. Methods. 12 piglets
   were randomized to baseline and electrical induced VF. After 5 min, the
   animals were resuscitated according to AHA PALS guidelines. After return
   of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), animals were observed for an
   additional 4 hours prior to cardiac MRI. Data (mean +/- SD) was analyzed
   using unpaired t-test; p value <= 0.05 was considered statistically
   significant. Results. Segmental wall motion (mm; baseline versus
   postarrest group) in segment 7 (left anterior descending (LAD)) was 4.68
   +/- 0.54 versus 3.31 +/- 0.64, p = 0.0026. In segment 13, it was 3.82
   +/- 0.96 versus 2.58 +/- 0.82, p = 0.02. In segment 14, it was 2.42 +/-
   0.44 versus 1.29 +/- 0.99, p = 0.028. Conclusion. Postarrest myocardial
   dysfunction resulted in segmental wall motion defects in the LAD
   territory. There were no perfusion defects in the involved segments.}},

Abstract = {{Transparent polycrystalline yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) ceramics have
   garnered an increased level of interest for high power laser
   applications due to their ability to be manufactured in large sizes, and
   doped in relatively substantial concentrations when compared to
   traditional single-crystalline gain media. However, surface
   characteristics have a direct effect on the lasing ability of these
   materials, and a lack of a fundamental understanding of the polishing
   mechanisms of these ceramics remains a challenge for their utilization.
   The aim of this paper is to study the polishing characteristics of YAG
   ceramics using magnetic field-assisted fmishing (MAF). An experimental
   setup was developed, through the refinement of the MAF process, for YAG
   ceramic workpieces. Using this equipment with diamond abrasives, the YAG
   ceramic surfaces were polished to sub-nanometer scale. Polishing trials
   with fine diamond abrasive and colloidal silica were then performed on
   this sub-nanometer surface and the material removal mechanisms were
   analyzed.
   Polishing with 0-0.1 mu m diameter diamond abrasive caused increasing
   roughness with polishing time due to the continuous cycle of relatively
   substantial chipping followed by minor smoothing. Polishing with
   colloidal silica caused valleys to widen with increased polishing time
   and the grain structure of the ceramic influenced the material removal.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing biopsy length could reduce the false negative rate in
   prostate biopsy diagnosis. In this paper, the effect of magnetic
   abrasive finishing (MAF) of needle inner surface on inner friction force
   and biopsy length was investigated. The test was conducted using the
   tissue-mimicking material polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and chicken breast.
   The inner friction forces of MAF-polished and unpolished needles were
   measured. In the PVC phantom, the smoothly polished needle had lowest
   inner friction force (0.0024 N/mm) and longest biopsy sample (34.3 mm).
   Although the roughly polished needle had a smoother surface than the
   unpolished needle, the significance of the effects on the biopsy
   performance due to the slight improvement of the needle surface was not
   observed. The biopsy tests with chicken breast tissue showed the trends
   similar to the case with PVC phantom. The smoothly polished needle had
   the smallest inner friction force (0.024 N/mm) and the longest biopsy
   sample (9.6 mm). These results showed that lowering the friction force
   between the needle and tissue facilitates the sliding of tissue along
   the needle, leading to a long biopsy sample. MAF can reduce the friction
   at the needle tissue interface and obtaining longer biopsy samples.}},

Abstract = {{The estimation of rock surface weathering, much like the estimation of
   shear strength of rock joints, is facilitated by the use of statistical
   methods on linear profiles. Unfortunately, a number of factors ranging
   from the size of the sampling interval used to the mathematics of the
   roughness index chosen can misrepresent the true roughness of a surface.
   A method is proposed to simulate rock profiles using a combination of
   generated signals and a Markov process for the purpose of studying and
   anticipating the effects of many variables on roughness estimates. The
   large-scale properties of rock are represented as sine waves, sawtooth
   waves, and a random Markov process and the small-scale properties are
   simulated with red noise. The generative parameters are varied to
   produce a corpus of simulated profiles, where sampling and measurement
   error is also simulated by lightly deflecting measurements with
   Gaussian-distributed noise. Using the simulated profiles, five different
   measures for roughness are compared and the results indicate that no one
   measure alone exhibits sensitivity to all generative parameters. The
   Fourier transform is applied to compare the frequency content of these
   simulated profiles to that of real limestone rock, providing some
   validation that the conclusions drawn from our simulated profiles also
   extend to profiles from real rock samples.}},

   proposed modulator combines the use of digital filters in a multi-stage

   modulator loops and quantizers and integrates exceptionally well with
   noise-shaping quantizers where the traditional SMASH fails. Furthermore,
   the proposed modulator relaxes the critical analog/digital matching
   problem of the MASH modulators while providing excellent stability.

Abstract = {{A fully synthesizable digital low drop-out regulator (LDO) with dual
   (coarse/fine) loops control is proposed. This structure employs a
   synchronized comparator to compare the feedback voltage (Vfb) and the
   desired reference voltage (Vref). A coarse loop is used to simplify the
   control logic circuit and increase the LDO response speed during the
   output dynamic transit. A fine loop is used to minimize the output
   ripple voltage of the LDO in the steady-state. A dynamic detection
   circuit using dual offset comparators is employed to detect the output
   voltage variation. To minimize the current consumption, the switching
   frequency is scaled to 1/32 of original frequency in steady-state. The
   circuit is implemented by purely digital standard cells. Simulation
   results at 130nm CMOS technology shows that this structure can achieve a
   peak current efficiency of 99.9\% using a 1 MHz clock and a 0.6 V

Abstract = {{As technology further scales, devices offer better performance with
   faster speed and lower power albeit at the cost of reliability. Advanced
   technology nodes introduce higher variations in manufacturing processes,
   and devices experience greater aging and environmental degradation.
   Although such reliability issues should be suppressed for the sake of
   performance in both CMOS and post-CMOS devices, researchers have
   lever-aged them for a variety of applications and unique primitives for
   hardware-oriented security. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
   study on device reliability and security, and make a qualitative
   assessment of different variability and degradation sources based on
   their impact on performance, reliability and security. We conclude that
   reliability and security both play vital roles for respective
   applications and must be treated in a holistic manner. Hence we urge the
   reliability and security communities to work together to develop new
   technologies for designing high performance, reliable and secure
   integrated circuits.}},

Abstract = {{Atmospheric differential drag can be used to control the relative motion
   of multiple coplanar spacecraft in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), without the
   use of any propellant, provided that they can vary their ballistic
   coefficients. However, the variability of the atmospheric density, and
   therefore the drag acceleration, makes the generation of accurate
   drag-based guidance a challenging problem. Currently available density
   models have biased results, causing errors in the drag force estimation.
   In this work a method for predicting the atmospheric density along the
   future orbit of a spacecraft is combined with a calibrator used with
   existing empirical atmospheric models. The combination is used to
   improve differential drag-based relative maneuvering by adding spatial
   resolution to atmospheric density prediction methods. This leads to the
   creation of more realistic guidance trajectories for spacecraft relative
   maneuvering based on differential drag.}},

Abstract = {{At Low Earth Orbits a differential in the drag acceleration between
   coplanar spacecraft can be used for controlling their relative motion in
   the orbital plane. Current methods for determining the drag acceleration
   may result in errors due to the inaccuracy of density models and
   misrepresentation of the drag coefficient. In this work a novel
   methodology for relative maneuvering of spacecraft under bounded
   uncertainties in the drag acceleration is developed. In order to vary
   the relative drag acceleration, the satellites modify their pitch angle.
   Two approaches are proposed. First, a dynamical model composed of the
   mean semi-major axis and argument of latitude is utilized for describing
   long range maneuvers. For this model, a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)
   is implemented, accounting for the uncertainties in the drag force. This
   controller guarantees asymptotic stability of the system up to a certain
   magnitude of the state vector, which is determined by the uncertainties.
   Furthermore, based on a cartesian relative motion formulation, a min-max
   control law is designed for short range maneuvers. This provides
   asymptotic stability under bounded uncertainties. The two approaches are
   tested in numerical simulations illustrating a long range re-phasing,
   performed using the LQR controller, followed by a short range rendezvous
   maneuver, accomplished using the min-max controller.}},

Abstract = {{Near threshold voltage computing enables transistor voltage scaling to
   continue with Moore's Law projection and dramatically improves power and
   energy efficiency. However, reducing the supply voltage to
   near-threshold level significantly increases the susceptibility of
   on-chip caches to process variations, leading to the high error rate.
   Most existing fault-tolerant schemes significantly sacrifice cache
   capacity and performance. In this paper, we propose a novel
   fault-tolerant cache architecture at near-threshold computing, which is
   suitable for high error rate memories. We first propose a
   variation-aware skewed-associative cache, and then redirect the faulty
   blocks to the error-free blocks based on it to explore the
   fault-tolerance cache design. Unlike previous cache reconfiguration
   schemes for the fault tolerance, our cache design does not need to
   sacrifice or disable any fault-free blocks to form a completely
   functional set. We use all error-free blocks and have the least cache
   capacity waste. More importantly, since the aging impact could also
   cause cell failures, our skewed cache takes the aggregated process
   variation and aging impact into the consideration. Last but not least,
   our skewed cache design avoids the complex remapping from faulty blocks
   to the error-free blocks and minimizes the hardware overheads. Our
   evaluation results show that our variation-aware fault-tolerant cache
   design exhibits strong capability to tolerate the high error rate, and
   more excitingly, its effectiveness on reducing the cache miss rate and
   improving the performance is even more obvious as the supply voltage
   scales down to the near-threshold region.}},

Abstract = {{Autonomous systems often use feedback from an imaging system for
   guidance, navigation, and control. Such feedback requires an image
   processing method that yields an inherent delay in state measurements.
   For some camera-to-hand applications, the image-based sensing and
   control computations may be computed by a more capable processor and
   then be transmitted to a sensorless vehicle, resulting in a delay in
   control execution. To account for these delays, an approach is developed
   in this paper that applies a transformation, to separate the image
   coordinates into spatial and time domain components. This
   transformation, along with a novel integral error system, allows for the
   development of a robust controller that compensates for uncertain
   time-varying state delays and known time-varying input delays for
   nonlinear image dynamics. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is used to
   prove that the developed controller enables a sensorless autonomous
   vehicle to yield uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) tracking of a
   desired image trajectory.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a new conditional gradient type method for
   convex optimization by calling a linear optimization (LO) oracle to
   minimize a series of linear functions over the feasible set. Different
   from the classic conditional gradient method, the conditional gradient
   sliding (CGS) algorithm developed herein can skip the computation of
   gradients from time to time and, as a result, can achieve the optimal
   complexity bounds in terms of not only the number of calls to the LO
   oracle but also the number of gradient evaluations. More specifically,
   we show that the CGS method requires O (1/root epsilon) and
   O(log(1/epsilon)) gradient evaluations, respectively, for solving smooth
   and strongly convex problems, while still maintaining the optimal
   O(1/epsilon) bound on the number of calls to the LO oracle. We also
   develop variants of the CGS method which can achieve the optimal
   complexity bounds for solving stochastic optimization problems and an
   important class of saddle point optimization problems. To the best of
   our knowledge, this is the first time that these types of
   projection-free optimal first-order methods have been developed in the
   literature. Some preliminary numerical results have also been provided
   to demonstrate the advantages of the CGS method.}},

Abstract = {{Test points are inserted into integrated circuits to increase fault
   coverage especially in logic built-in self-test (LBIST) schemes.
   Commercial tools have been developed over the past decade to insert test
   points in circuits under test, but they are often inefficient and incur
   unacceptably large area overhead. Our analysis shows that many test
   points have little or no impact on test coverage. Therefore, we propose
   a framework to evaluate test point's impact on a design and rank them
   based on their efficiency, and to obtain an optimal configuration of the
   most efficient test points accurately and rapidly. Within this
   framework, we have two metrics; namely the efficient test point
   insertion (ETPI) metric and the test point removal estimation (TPRE)
   metric. The ETPI metric is developed to remove the most inefficient test
   points inserted in the circuits by the commercial tools, thereby
   minimizing area penalty with very limited test coverage loss. The TPRE
   metric is introduced to quickly select the appropriate test point
   removal scheme. Since TPRE can estimate area overhead and test coverage
   for designs with different percentage of test points removed without the
   actual insertion of test points and without the need for lengthy circuit
   simulation, large amount of processing time is saved especially for
   large circuits. Experimental results indicate that ETPI can reduce area
   overhead reduction by up to 95.00\% with test coverage reduction as low
   as 0.57\%. In addition, results by applying the TPRE metric indicate
   that the difference between estimation and actual simulation/synthesis
   results for area overhead is less than 0.10\% for most cases, and the
   difference between them for test coverage is less than 1.00\% for most
   cases.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of detecting ground moving targets with arbitrary linear
   motion using an airborne multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar is
   considered. The proposed approach leverages a long coherent processing
   interval (CPI), and maximizes the moving target signal energy via
   matching the target's azimuthal signature. The algorithm forms SAR
   images focused to different hypothesized along-track target velocities,
   and then uses the MIMO array to detect moving targets in these images.
   The use of a MIMO array enhances the system's GMTI performance without
   requiring additional physical channels via the virtual array concept. By
   reparametrizing the target's linear motion profile, the SAR image
   formation process can be decoupled from the MIMO array processing,
   allowing for efficient implementation of the algorithm. Because the
   approach generates estimates of the target's along-track and cross-track
   velocity components, a unique determination of the target's motion
   parameters is possible. The approach is derived, and investigated via
   simulated data.}},

Abstract = {{Power Line Communication (PLC) has become an integral part of home area
   networks (HANs) with increasing deployment of intelligent and connected
   devices. The advent of smart devices creates a heterogeneous type of
   network with a variety of throughput and delay sensitive applications
   that must coexist in the HAN. Meeting the quality of service (QoS) for
   various applications requires high MAC throughput, low channel access
   delay and prioritized channel access for certain types of data. The
   Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol for PLC, defined in HomePlug and
   IEEE 1901, exhibits significant degradation in MAC throughput and
   increasing channel access delay when the number of users increases. PLC
   MAC layer issues have received relatively modest attention of
   researchers compared with physical layer problems and as a result
   relatively little improvement in MAC throughput and delay performance
   has been reported over the standard IEEE 1901 protocol. This paper
   studies an adaptive contention window PLC MAC protocol with a view to
   assessing access delay performance of this modified protocol, with the
   throughput and prioritized traffic classes. In the adaptive protocol,
   each node observes the channel status and adaptively finds the optimum
   contention window size. Results demonstrate a significant improvement in
   both MAC efficiency and access delay for the highest priority class in
   the presence of lower priority classes. Whereas the MAC efficiency drops
   down to 10\% in standard protocols, the proposed adaptive MAC protocol
   retains its efficiency at about 81\% for up to 100 users. Also, the
   channel access delay is for the modified protocol is maintained under
   200 ms for 100 users compared to more than 1000 ms for the standard
   HomePlug MAC.}},

Abstract = {{Transportation engineers and planners are becoming more interested in
   using roundabouts to address capacity and traffic operations, access
   management, and safety concerns in the transportation system.
   Roundabouts are preferred as a form of intersection by some communities
   because they allow for continuous flow of traffic and they can be less
   expensive to maintain and operate. However, the operational
   characteristics in the functional area are less well understood than
   other types of intersections. Therefore, although roundabouts are being
   used in a variety of contexts, existing research does not provide
   detailed guidance on how to evaluate the use of roundabouts as a form of
   access management. This paper provides an operational analysis of
   selected roundabouts in Florida and South Carolina. The operational
   analysis identifies four areas of concern: corner clearance, including
   stopping site distance and intersection sight distance; the flow of
   traffic and the queuing of vehicles in the functional area near
   roundabouts, including driveway and intersection spacing, and the use of
   medians; access to major activity centers; and safety of vulnerable road
   users, especially bicyclists and pedestrians.}},

Abstract = {{Management of complex ecosystems is a difficult process that involves
   multiple factors and stakeholders. In most cases, the interactions of
   these factors and stakeholders' trade-offs are not considered
   quantitatively in the design and management of ecosystems. To address
   these issues mental modeling is useful for eliciting stakeholder
   objectives and preferences in order to evaluate preliminary knowledge
   about structure and function of complex ecosystems. This is advantageous
   for ecosystem analysis, modeling, and management.
   Here, we provide an assessment of stakeholder preferences and mental
   models for the case study of a large-scale watershed in Costa Rica
   composed by two rivers basins and one wetland. Trade-offs are related to
   water management in relation to ecological, agricultural, energy, and
   tourism endpoints that are affected by potential sets of dam and canal
   configurations. We apply and further develop a network-based model for
   stakeholder text analysis. Our innovation is the introduction of Network
   Complexity (NC) as a metric to characterize the inferred influenced
   diagram and to monitor the variation of such diagram under perturbations
   in socio-ecological factors provided by stakeholders and related to
   ecosystems. Perturbation effects-innovatively determined and assessed by
   global sensitivity and uncertainty analyses may reveal fundamental
   factor importance and interactions of ecosystem factors and ecosystem
   resilience. The derived influence diagram can be considered as the
   mental model of stakeholders because its construction is based on the
   direct elicitation of stakeholder preferences and objective in ad hoc
   workshops organized for this study.
   The decision analysis-based mental modeling approach allows a
   transparent and participatory decision-making concerning ecosystem
   management. The approach facilitates the identification and balance of
   trade-offs among stakeholder groups. Thus, it is coherent with the
   sustainability paradigm that includes social factors into the analysis,
   design, and management of complex systems.}},

Abstract = {{While traditional sensors provide accurate measurements of quantifiable
   information, humans provide better qualitative information and holistic
   assessments. Sensor fusion approaches that team humans and machines can
   take advantage of the benefits provided by each while mitigating the
   shortcomings. These two sensor sources can be fused together using
   Bayesian fusion, which assumes that there is a method of generating a
   probabilistic representation of the sensor measurement. This general
   framework of fusing estimates can also be applied to joint human-machine
   decision making. In the simple case, binary decisions can be fused by
   using a probability of taking an action versus inaction from each
   decision-making source. These are fused together to arrive at a final
   probability of taking an action, which would be taken if above a
   specified threshold. In the case of path planning, rather than binary
   decisions being fused, complex decisions can be fused by allowing the
   human and machine to interact with each other. For example, the human
   can draw a suggested path while the machine planning algorithm can
   refine it to avoid obstacles and remain dynamically feasible. Similarly,
   the human can revise a suggested path to achieve secondary goals not
   encoded in the algorithm such as avoiding dangerous areas in the
   environment.}},

Title = {{Probabilistic bearing serviceability of drilled shafts in randomly
   stratified rock using a geostatistical perturbation method}},
Journal = {{STRUCTURAL SAFETY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{59-70}},
Abstract = {{The bearing stiffness (i.e., the slope of load-displacement curve at the
   tip) of drilled shaft foundations is an important serviceability-design
   parameter, especially for rock-socketed application of shallow embedment
   depths. Numerical solution techniques, such as finite element analysis
   (FEA) models, provide useful tools for investigating the bearing (tip)
   stiffness under various boundary conditions both homogeneous and
   heterogeneous. However, for uncertain and spatially heterogeneous
   mechanical input parameters, computational costs are high when
   meaningful statistical parameters of tip stiffness are to be obtained
   from full Monte Carlo FEA simulations. In the present work, an
   analytical expression for a one-dimensional, linear load-displacement
   relationship is derived by making use of perturbation analysis on
   randomly-stratified rock layers and their effects in the development of
   the tip stiffness using two-dimensional axisymmetric FEA. Numerical
   results show that spatial variability in both elastic modulus and
   undrained shear strength (cohesion) of supporting rock layers affect tip
   stiffness. However, the influence of cohesion on expectation and
   uncertainty of tip stiffness may be safely neglected for serviceability
   design. The tip stiffness of a drilled-shaft foundation is found to be
   highly proportional to the harmonic average of elastic moduli with
   averaging weights decreasing exponentially from the shaft tip downward.
   Exponentially-weighted harmonic averaging of elastic moduli is then
   incorporated in Winkler models to reasonably predict the results of full
   Monte Carlo FEA for cases where (1) a depth profile of elastic modulus
   is available at the footprint of a shaft, and (2) only geostatistical
   characteristics (i.e., expectation, variance, correlation length) of
   elasticity of rock are known a priori at a construction site. The
   presented closed-form solution is in good agreement with predictions of
   Monte Carlo FEA, and thus, may offer a practical alternative tool for
   the serviceability design. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{TRANSFORMING THE PLASTICULTURE PRODUCTION SYSTEM THROUGH NOVEL BED
   GEOMETRY DESIGN}},
Journal = {{TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{993-1003}},
Abstract = {{Raised-bed plasticulture with drip irrigation is used worldwide for
   growing high-value crops, especially vegetables. This high-input,
   intensive system must become more efficient to meet food demands while
   reducing its environmental footprint. Futuristic tall and narrow compact
   beds were designed with an aim to improve the plasticulture system by
   increasing or maintaining yield while decreasing system input
   requirements. Using a whole-systems approach, compact geometries were
   evaluated on an example crop, eggplant (Solanum melongena L.), in the
   ecologically sensitive but highly productive sub-tropical Everglades
   region of Florida. Two compact beds, 61 cm (width) x 25 cm (height) and
   45 cm x 30 cm, were evaluated against a conventional short and wide bed,
   91 cm x 15 cm. The conventional bed used two drip tapes for irrigation
   and fertigation. The compact beds needed only one tape but produced
   equivalent yields as the conventional bed. Irrigation, nitrogen, and
   phosphorus application rates were respectively reduced by 50\%, 14\%,
   and 19\% in the compact beds. Water and nutrient productivities with the
   compact beds increased by at least \$43 per 10 kL irrigation, \$6 per kg
   nitrogen, and \$8 per kg phosphorus applied, representing respective
   gains of 92\%, 11\%, and 8\% over the conventional bed. Productivity
   increases highlight how compact beds can make plasticulture more
   efficient. Shifting to compact beds also brings non-water co-benefits,
   including reductions in the system's production costs by \$560 to \$670
   ha(-1), carbon footprint by 5\% to 10\% (reduced fumigant and plastic
   usage), agricultural plastic waste, and potential detrimental impacts
   from changed climate. Compact beds provide flood and disease protection
   by decreasing impervious (mulched) surface area and having extra bed
   height above the ground. Use of compact beds at the study farm would
   decrease rainfall intensity in the row middles by 34\% and increase the
   farm's soil water storage capacity by 52\% (1.4 cm). Increased storage
   and infiltration of rainfall will decrease flooding frequency and runoff
   volume, thereby reducing peak flows in downstream environments. Compact
   beds also have an added economic benefit for farmers who pay to lease
   land, as production can be increased through a higher plant population
   density without changing total mulched surface area. A cultural shift to
   taller and narrower compact beds makes plasticulture more sustainable as
   water, nutrient, cost, and energy inputs are reduced without sacrificing
   yields. Compact beds provide the impetus to transform plasticulture to a
   futuristic, further-optimized system that is more automated (e.g.,
   chemigation), less labor intensive, and better adapted to climate change
   for continued economic and environmental viability.}},

Title = {{Multimodal Transportation Choices and Health: Exploratory Analysis Using
   Data Fusion Techniques}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2598}},
Pages = {{37-45}},
Abstract = {{This study demonstrates the feasibility of fusing large-scale travel and
   health surveys and uses the new comprehensive data set generated to
   model the relationship between health and multimodal (walking, biking,
   transit, and vehicle usage) long-term (weekly, monthly, and yearly)
   travel choices. Two measures of health, the body-mass index (BMI) and a
   self-assessed physical health score (SAPHS), were fused from a health
   survey onto a travel survey at the disaggregate (individual) level. The
   probabilistic record linkage software, Link Plus, was used for the data
   fusion purposes. The methodology was validated by using the eating and
   health module (EH) of the American Time Use Surveys (ATUS).
   Subsequently, the algorithm was used to match the health information
   from theATUS to theNational Household Travel Surveys (NHTS) of 2008 to
   2009, and the resulting master data set was used to develop models for
   multi modal travel choices and health. The statistical analysis
   indicates that although increasing walking and transit use were
   associated with better health (relative to nonusers of the mode), those
   with the highest levels of walking and transit use were also found to be
   in poor health relative to moderate users of the mode. Similarly, those
   at the two ends of the vehicle miles traveled spectrum (first and fourth
   quartiles) had higher BMI compared with those in the middle of the
   spectrum. There were no statistically significant effects of weekly bike
   trips on health measures. Overall, this study is envisioned as a
   proof-of-concept of how data fusion techniques may be used to integrate
   multiple data sets to facilitate a comprehensive study of multimodal
   travel choices and health.}},

Title = {{Aging Population-Focused Accessibility Assessment of Multimodal
   Facilities in Florida}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2584}},
Pages = {{45-61}},
Abstract = {{A significant responsibility of officials involved in transportation
   planning is ensuring people's accessibility to multimodal facilities.
   This challenging task depends on the available transportation
   infrastructure as well as the overall population, traffic, roadway, and
   regional characteristics. Such planning takes on additional complexity
   when aging populations are considered because any extra time that they
   incur in reaching these facilities can be especially confounding in
   light of their potential health and other safety concerns. As such,
   there is a need for transportation plans to have a multimodal
   transportation assessment component that specifically focuses on the
   accessibility of aging people to critical facilities. To accomplish this
   goal, this paper describes a geographic information systems-based
   methodology for measuring the aging population-focused accessibility to
   multimodal facilities in Florida. Spatially detailed population block-
   and county-based accessibility scores are calculated with respect to key
   intermodal facility types (airports, bus stations, and railway and ferry
   stations) and visually assessed by geographic information system maps.
   The knowledge obtained from this accessibility analysis can successfully
   contribute to the development of more reliable aging population focused
   multimodal transportation plans, as the analysis points to specific
   areas where accessibility could be improved.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{301-318}},
Abstract = {{With an increasing world population in need of food and a limited amount
   of land for cultivation, higher efficiency in agricultural production,
   especially fruits and vegetables, is increasingly required. The success
   of agricultural production in the marketplace depends on its quality and
   cost. The cost of labor for crop production, harvesting, and
   post-harvesting operations is a major portion of the overall production
   cost, especially for specialty crops such as strawberry. As a result, a
   multitude of automation technologies involving semi-autonomous and
   autonomous robots have been utilized, with an aim of minimizing labor
   costs and operation time to achieve a considerable improvement in
   farming efficiency and economic performance. Research and technologies
   for weed control, harvesting, hauling, sorting, grading, and/or packing
   have been generally reviewed for fruits and vegetables, yet no review
   has been conducted thus far specifically for robotic technology being
   used in strawberry production. In this article, studies on strawberry
   robotics and their associated automation technologies are reviewed in
   terms of mechanical subsystems (e.g., traveling unit, handling unit,
   storage unit) and electronic subsystems (e.g., sensors, computer,
   communication, and control). Additionally, robotic technologies being
   used in different stages in strawberry production operations are
   reviewed. The robot designs for strawberry management are also
   categorized in terms of purpose and environment.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents results of an experimental investigation of the
   impacts of total pressure distortions on the performance of a transonic
   turbofan. Fan rotor response to screen produced total pressure
   distortions was measured by two high frequency response probes (Kulite
   sensors). These probes measured the transient flow behind the fan rotor.
   Ensemble averaging based on a once-per-revolution encoder enabled
   separation of the pressure signal into its deterministic and stochastic
   components. The deterministic portion of the signal provided information
   about the effects of the distortion on the wake structure of the
   individual fan blades. The stochastic component of the signal gave
   indications of the effects of distortion on turbulence production (and
   losses) in the fan.
   The qualitative trends provided by these high-frequency measurements
   show that the blade loading variations caused the wake depths and
   thicknesses to increase in the low pressure in-let regions. In addition,
   the turbulence production increased, peaking in the blade wakes. These
   behaviors indicate that the response of the fan was governed by a
   trailing edge separation that moves forward and backward on the upper
   blade surface in a dynamic manner.
   This paper also includes discussion of the challenges associated with
   obtaining quantitative data with this type of probe. The results were
   significantly affected by probe frequency response and dynamic flow
   angle sensitivity. Resolving the blade wake structure and turbulence
   information requires probe tolerance to high-gradient flows and large
   flow angle fluctuations, with very high frequency response. The paper
   incorporates a discussion of improved probe design approaches to advance
   future research.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the often-neglected correlation terms for
   uncertainty propagation and shows their importance for rigorous
   uncertainty analysis. It shows that these terms can be leveraged, often
   through simple experimental design changes to substantially reduce
   uncertainty. The efficiency equation is particularly suited to this
   approach, with order of magnitude uncertainty reductions possible. The
   paper will present this effect from both a theoretical study and from
   data measured behind a transonic fan during a distortion response
   program.
   The efficiency equation is particularly suited to improving uncertainty
   by leveraging the correlation terms because the temperature uncertainty
   contributes most of the overall uncertainty. Systematic error sources
   usually dominate thermocouple measurement uncertainty because the slow
   time response leads to small random errors. The partial derivatives with
   respect to inlet and outlet total temperature have opposite signs.
   Correlations between these systematic errors are relatively easy to
   force through using a single data acquisition system and in-situ
   calibration standard. This paper presents performance comparisons of
   these effects for thermocouples. For a 1.35 pressure ratio, 85\%
   efficiency fan, the uncertainty can be reduced by correlation from 85\%
   +/- 6.7\% to 85\% +/- 0.48\% for typical K-type thermocouples.}},

Abstract = {{Convolving the output of discontinuous Galerkin computations with
   symmetric smoothness-increasing accuracy-conserving (SIAC) filters can
   improve both smoothness and accuracy. To extend convolution to the
   boundaries, several one-sided spline filters have recently been
   developed. This paper interprets these filters as instances of a general
   class of position-dependent (PSIAC) spline filters that can have
   nonuniform knot sequences and skip B-splines of the sequence. PSIAC
   filters with rational knot sequences have rational coefficients. For
   prototype knot sequences, such as integer sequences that may have
   repeated entries, PSIAC filters can be expressed in symbolic form. Based
   on the insight that filters for shifted or scaled knot sequences are
   easily derived by nonuniform scaling of one prototype filter, a single
   filter can be reused in different locations and at different scales.
   Computing a value of the convolution then simplifies to forming a scalar
   product of a short vector with the local output data. Restating
   one-sided filters in this form improves both stability and efficiency
   compared to their original formulation via numerical integration. PSIAC
   filtering is demonstrated for several established and one new boundary
   filter.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, NVDIMM (Non-Volatile Dual In-line Memory Module) is being

   Nevertheless, existing efforts largely focus on NVDIMM specification and

   NVDIMM are not fully investigated. In this paper, we present a
   NVDIMM-based simulator called MCSSim to help study the memory channel
   storage techniques. MCSSim is a cycle-accurate simulator that is
   elaborated with the consideration of differences between the memory
   channel interface and the NAND flash memory features. MCSSim is also
   implemented with the DRAMSim2 {[}31] simulator thus enabling the
   simulation of a variety of hybrid memory systems by combining of DRAM
   DIMM and NVDIMM. We have done some experiments with MCSSim, and the
   experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed simulator.}},

Abstract = {{At the time of developing the latest Road Master Plan for the Madrid
   Region (Spain), the question came up as to what traffic volume should be
   established as a criterion to trigger the upgrade of a two-lane highway
   to a four-lane facility. Conventional wisdom suggested a maximum annual
   average daily traffic (AADT) of 10,000 veh/day. The main objective of
   this research was to determine whether 10,000 veh/day is a reasonable
   upgrade threshold or if this threshold is too conservative and a higher
   value can be adopted. Assessment was made based on actual traffic volume
   measured in two-lane facilities, service vehicle tables provided by
   different highway agencies and a statistical analysis of the traffic
   volume distribution of in-service facilities in the Madrid Region. A
   total of 36 segments exceeding an AADT of 10,000 veh/day at some point
   between 1998 and 2008 were found and analyzed. Results indicated that
   maximum observed values fit fairly well with the service volume tables
   provided by HCM 2010 and FDOT and an increase in the upgrade threshold
   is feasible. These results offer guidance as to what value can be
   considered for future planning applications, including impact traffic
   studies and local and regional planning. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {{The ultimate methane generation potential (L-0) of municipal solid waste
   (MSW) has been used in first-order decay models for the estimation of
   landfill gas (LFG) production for the previous 30years. L-0 is an
   inherent property of the waste component, often a function of the
   lignocellulosic concentrations within. Methane yields of individual
   waste components can be measured in a controlled laboratory setting;
   however, the extent to which each portion degrades in a landfill is
   uncertain. Methane generation in a landfill is difficult to estimate due
   to the spatial and temporal variations among sites and the heterogeneous
   composition of MSW streams. Predicting LFG production is further
   complicated by prior aerobic degradation, fugitive gas emissions that
   escape into the atmosphere, and unforeseen chemical inhibition within
   the landfill environment. Published L-0 values are reviewed and compared
   to the methane yields of mixed-waste and waste components measured in
   the laboratory. Experimentally determined values of mixed MSW ranged
   from 35 to 167m(3) CH4/Mg MSW. Modeled values and those based on
   biodegradability of individual components and waste composition data
   ranged from 20 to 223m(3) CH4/Mg MSW. These data constitute a wide range
   of experimental methodologies and waste composition characteristics with
   respect to geography and time. The usefulness, comparability, and
   applicability of such data are discussed. The use of L-0 as a parameter
   in LFG generation models and life-cycle assessments is reviewed and

Abstract = {{Data classification is a widely used data mining technique for big data
   analysis. By training massive data collected from the real world, data
   classification helps learners discover hidden data patterns. In addition
   to data training, given a trained model from collected data, a user can
   classify whether a new incoming data belongs to an existing class; or,
   multiple distributed entities may collaborate to test the similarity of
   their trained results. However, due to data locality and privacy
   concerns, it is infeasible for large-scale distributed systems to share
   each individual's datasets with each other for data similarity check. On
   the one hand, the trained model is an entity's private asset and may
   leak private information, which should be well protected from all other
   non-collaborative entities. On the other hand, the new incoming data may
   contain sensitive information which cannot be disclosed directly for
   classification. To address the above privacy issues, we propose a
   privacy-preserving data classification and similarity evaluation scheme
   for distributed systems. With our scheme, neither new arriving data nor
   trained models are directly revealed during the classification and
   similarity evaluation procedures. The proposed scheme can be applied to
   many fields using data classification and evaluation. Based on extensive
   real-world experiments, we have also evaluated the privacy preservation,
   feasibility, and efficiency of the proposed scheme.}},

Title = {{Evalution of Strauctural Behavior of Precast Prestressed Concrete
   Pavement With Finite Element Analysis}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},

Pages = {{84-93}},
Abstract = {{A full-scale precast prestressed concrete pavement (PPCP) system was
   constructed and evaluated under actual traffic load conditions to
   develop the design guideline under Florida conditions. This test section
   showed good load transfer efficiency and riding quality. However,
   information was lacking about its structural response and potential
   performance. A three-dimensional finite element model was developed for
   stress analysis of PPCP under critical loading conditions. The developed
   three-dimensional model was calibrated by using deflection data obtained
   with a falling weight deflectometer. The model was used to perform a
   parametric analysis to determine the effects of critical loading
   location, concrete modulus, coefficient of thermal expansion of
   concrete, loss of prestress force, and subgrade stiffness under typical
   Florida conditions. Results of the parametric study indicate that the
   maximum stresses in the concrete increased significantly as the concrete
   modulus and coefficient thermal expansion increased. Because of the
   increase in flexural strength associated with the increase in elastic
   modulus of the concrete, an increase in elastic modulus of the concrete
   results in a decrease in the computed stress-to-strength ratio under
   critical load temperature conditions. The PPCP system that was evaluated
   appeared to have a good predicted pavement performance with a computed
   stress-to-strength ratio of less than 0.5, with up to an additional loss
   of 20\% of prestress force in the longitudinal and transverse
   directions. Variations in the base and subbase properties were found to
   have a minimal effect on the maximum induced stresses in concrete. This
   finding indicates that the PPCP system is appropriate for a wide variety
   of subbase and subgrade conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formed by alpha-pinene and
   1,3,5-trimethylbenzene photooxidation under different NOx regimes is
   simulated using the Master Chemical Mechanism v3.2 (MCM) coupled with an
   absorptive gas-particle partitioning module. Vapor pressures for
   individual compounds are estimated with the SIMPOL. 1 group contribution
   model for determining apportionment of reaction products to each phase.
   We apply chemoinformatic tools to harvest functional group (FG)
   composition from the simulations and estimate their contributions to the
   overall oxygen to carbon ratio. Furthermore, we compare FG abundances in
   simulated SOA to measurements of FGs reported in previous chamber
   studies using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. These simulations
   qualitatively capture the dynamics of FG composition of SOA formed from
   both alpha-pinene and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene in low-NOx conditions,
   especially in the first hours after start of photooxidation. Higher
   discrepancies are found after several hours of simulation; the nature of
   these discrepancies indicates sources of uncertainty or types of
   reactions in the condensed or gas phase missing from current model
   implementation. Higher discrepancies are found in the case of
   alpha-pinene photooxidation under different NOx concentration regimes,
   which are reasoned through the domination by a few polyfunctional
   compounds that disproportionately impact the simulated FG abundance in
   the aerosol phase. This manuscript illustrates the usefulness of FG
   analysis to complement existing methods for model-measurement
   evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{Determining a person's intent, such as the planned direction of their
   movement, directly from their cortical activity could support important
   applications such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Continuing
   development of improved BCI systems requires a better understanding of
   how the brain prepares for and executes movements. To contribute to this
   understanding, we recorded surface cortical potentials
   (electrocorticographic signals; ECoG) in 11 human subjects performing a
   delayed center-out task to establish the differential role of high gamma
   activity (HGA) and the local motor potential (LMP) as a function of time
   and anatomical area during movement preparation and execution. High
   gamma modulations mostly confirm previous findings of sensorimotor
   cortex involvement, whereas modulations in LMPs are observed in
   prefrontal cortices. These modulations include directional information
   during movement planning as well as execution. Our results suggest that
   sampling signals from these widely distributed cortical areas improves
   decoding accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) is a security primitive that has been
   proven to be effective in diverse security solutions ranging from
   hardware authentication to on-die entropy generation. PUFs can be
   implemented in a design in two possible ways: (1) adding a separate
   dedicated circuit; and (2) reusing an existing on-chip structure for
   generating random signatures. A large percentage of existing PUFs falls
   into the first category, which suffers from the important drawback of
   often unacceptable hardware and design overhead. Moreover, they cannot
   be applied to legacy designs, which do not allow insertion of additional
   circuit structures. Intrinsic PUFs, that rely on pre-existing circuit
   structures, such as static random-access memory (SRAM), fall into the
   second category. They, however, typically suffer from poor entropy as
   well as lack of robustness. In this paper, we introduce a novel PUF
   implementation of the second category that exploits the effect of
   manufacturing process variations in SRAM read access current. In
   particular, we note that transistor level variations in SRAM cells cause
   significant variations in the read current and the variation changes
   with the stored content in a SRAM cell. We propose a method to transform
   the analog read current value for an SRAM array into robust binary
   signatures. The proposed PUF can be easily employed for authentication
   of commercial SRAM chips without any design modification. Furthermore,
   it can be realized, with minor hardware modification, into chips with
   embedded memory, e.g., a processor, for on-die entropy generation.
   Simulation results at 45nm CMOS process for 1000 chips as well as
   measurement results based on 30 commercial SRAM chips, show promising
   randomness, uniqueness and robustness under environmental fluctuations.}},

Abstract = {{Optimized and custom arithmetic circuits are widely used in embedded
   systems such as multimedia applications, cryptography systems, signal
   processing and console games. Debugging of arithmetic circuits is a
   challenge due to increasing complexity coupled with non-standard
   implementations. Existing equivalence checking techniques produce a
   remainder to indicate the presence of a potential bug. However, bug
   localization remains a major bottleneck. Simulation-based validation
   using random or constrained-random tests are not effective and can be
   infeasible for complex arithmetic circuits. In this paper, we present an
   automated test generation and bug localization technique for debugging
   arithmetic circuits. This paper makes two important contributions. We
   propose an automated approach for generating directed tests by suitable
   assignments of input variables to make the reminder non-zero. The
   generated tests are guaranteed to activate the unknown bug. We also
   propose a bug detection and correction technique by utilizing the
   patterns of remainder terms as well as the intersection of regions
   activated by the generated tests. Our experimental results demonstrate
   that the proposed approach can be used for automated debugging of
   complex arithmetic circuits.}},

Abstract = {{A major challenge in post-silicon debug is to generate efficient tests
   that activate requisite coverage goals on the target hardware while also
   producing results that are observable through a given on-chip
   design-for-debug (DfD) architecture. Unfortunately, such tests cannot be
   generated by analysis of RTL models, both because of design complexity
   and since the implementation can be buggy. In this paper, we propose an
   approach to address this problem by exploiting transaction-level models
   (TLM). Our approach involves mapping tests and observability
   requirements between TLM and RTL, enabling TLM analysis to generate
   post-silicon tests. We provide two case studies to demonstrate the
   flexibility and effectiveness of our proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Partially reconfigurable (PR) FPGAs enable preemptive hardware (HW)
   multitasking using PR regions (PRRs). To enable this multitasking, the
   HW task's partial bitstream is downloaded to only the task's PRR, and
   only that PRR is reconfigured. Since only a small portion of the FPGA
   fabric is reconfigured, reconfiguration time is significantly reduced as
   compared to reconfiguring the entire fabric, however this time is not
   negligible. Reconfiguration time can be reduced/hidden using two
   techniques: configuration prefetching and configuration reuse. Even
   though these techniques can effectively reduce/hide reconfiguration
   overhead, prior works in preemptive HW multitasking did not use these
   techniques. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work evaluated
   physical implementations of these techniques on PR FPGAs, which
   precludes consideration of physical-implementation-specific details,
   such as delays in accessing bitstreams, speed limitations during
   reconfiguration, etc. In this work, we present a novel implementation of
   configuration prefetching and reuse for preemptive HW multitasking on a
   Virtex-5 FPGA, however, our established fundamentals are device- family
   independent.}},

Abstract = {{DMFs are spherical DNA-diacyllipid nanostructures formed by hydrophobic
   effects between lipid tails coupled to single-stranded DNAs. Such
   properties as high cellular permeability, low critical micelle
   concentration (CMC) and facile fabrication facilitate intracellular
   imaging and drug delivery. While the basic properties of NFs have been
   amply described and tested, few studies have characterized the
   fundamental properties of DMFs with particular respect to aggregation
   number, dissociation constant and biostability. Therefore, to further
   explore their conformational features and enhanced stability in complex
   biological systems, we herein report a series of characterization
   studies. Static light scattering (SLS) demonstrated that DMFs possess
   greater DNA loading capacity when compared to other DNA-based
   nanostructures. Upon binding to complementary DNA (cDNA), DMFs showed
   excellent dissociation constants (K-d) and increased melting
   temperatures, as well as constant CMC (10 nM) independent of DNA length.
   DMFs also present significantly enhanced stability in aqueous solution
   with nuclease and cell lysate. These properties make DMFs ideal for
   versatile applications in bioanalysis and theranostics studies.}},

Abstract = {{We report a method of concentrating genomic length DNA within a
   microfluidic device, using a novel mechanism that combines
   polyelectrolyte migration with electrophoretic recirculation. Suitable
   combinations of geometry, pressure and voltage will trap long DNA
   molecules (>10 kbp) within a small volume (approximately 1 nL),
   amplifying the local concentration at rates in excess of 1000 fold per
   minute. The rate at which DNA accumulates is length dependent, while
   charged particles of similar size pass freely through the device.
   Experimental observations confirm that the rapid accumulation of DNA at
   the inlet is caused by an outward migration of the polyelectrolyte
   towards the capillary boundaries, followed by electrophoresis of DNA
   within the stagnant fluid layer next to the wall.}},

Pages = {{30-38}},
Abstract = {{On-road vehicles consume a substantial amount of fuel and emit air
   pollutants, including carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, and nitrogen oxides.
   Increasing concern about air quality has meant increasing interest in
   accurate estimates of microscale vehicle energy use and emissions
   (EU\&E). Vehicle EU\&E rates are related to vehicle-specific power
   (VSP). For a given vehicle, VSP is a function of vehicle speed,
   acceleration, and grade, each of which can be categorized as an
   externally observable variable (EOV). However, internally observable
   variables (IOVs), such as manifold absolute pressure (MAP) and engine
   revolutions per minute (RPM), are more predictive of EU\&E. Field
   measurements were conducted for 10 on-road vehicles using a portable
   emissions measurement system, an on-board diagnostic scan tool, and GPS
   receivers to measure exhaust concentrations and engine activity and to
   estimate road grade. VSP and the product of MAP and RPM (P-MxR) are
   useful as indicators of engine load. IOV-based models were developed to
   predict EU\&E rates. The IOV-based models typically performed better
   than EOV-based models. The models demonstrated could be integrated into
   next-generation traffic simulation programs, as well as into vehicle
   engine control units, to provide feedback on real-time emissions.}},

Abstract = {{Cache vulnerability due to soft errors is one of the reliability
   concerns in embedded systems. Dynamic reconfiguration techniques are
   widely studied for improving cache energy without considering the
   implications of cache vulnerability. Maintaining a useful data longer in
   the cache can be beneficial for energy improvement due to reduction in
   miss rates, however, longer data retention negatively impacts the
   vulnerability due to soft errors. This paper studies the trade-off
   between energy efficiency improvement and reduction in cache
   vulnerability during cache reconfiguration. We propose two heuristic
   approaches for reliability-and energy-aware dynamic cache
   reconfiguration. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed
   approaches can provide drastic reduction in cache vulnerability with
   minor impact on energy and performance.}},

Abstract = {{Raman Spectroscopy provides a non-invasive approach to study cells and
   tissues, and its ability to provide biochemical composition information
   of samples shows great importance for the research, diagnosis and
   treatment of cancer. However, conventional Raman Spectroscopy suffers
   from weak signal strength observed in many biological samples.
   Surface-Enhanced Resonance Raman Spectroscopy (SERRS) can overcome this
   disadvantage with the presence of roughened nano-dimensional noble-metal
   surfaces. In order to study the role of integrins in breast cancer
   invasiveness, gold nanostars were conjugated with cyclo-RGDf/k peptide
   for targeting integrins on breast cancer cells and high-speed Raman
   mapping was employed to assess the samples. Due to the high
   dimensionality of the datasets collected through SERRS, we have proposed
   a semisupervised framework combining feature selection and
   classification techniques for nanostars detection and tested our method
   on a breast cancer cells. The results show the advantage of our
   framework over other data mining technique and potentially provide a new
   method for evaluating the role of integrins in tumor development. Also,
   the features selected can possibly be used for further studies on
   compositional changes observed during the process of breast cancer
   progression and metastasis.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a nanostructured piezoelectric beam is fabricated using
   vertically aligned lead zirconate titanate (PZT) nanowire arrays and its
   capability of continuous power generation is demonstrated through direct

   PZT thin film coated titanium foil using a hydrothermal reaction. The
   PZT thin film serves as a nucleation site while the titanium foil is
   used as the bottom electrode. Electromechanical frequency response
   function (FRF) analysis is performed to evaluate the power harvesting
   efficiency of the fabricated device. Furthermore, the feasibility of the
   continuous power generation using the nanostructured beam is
   demonstrated through measuring output voltage from PZT nanowires when
   beam is subjected to a sinusoidal base excitation. The effect of tip
   mass on the voltage generation of the PZT nanowire arrays is evaluated

Abstract = {{Recently, the reinforcement-matrix interface of fiber reinforced
   polymers has been modified through grafting nanostructures -
   particularly carbon nanotubes and ZnO nanowires - on to the fiber
   surface. This type of interface engineering has made a great impact on
   the development of multiscale composites that have high stiffness,
   interfacial strength, toughness, and vibrational damping - qualities
   that are mutually exclusive to a degree in most raw materials. Although
   the efficacy of such nanostructured interfaces has been established, the
   reinforcement mechanisms of these multiscale composites have not been
   explored. Here, strain transfer across a nanowire interphase is studied
   in order to gain a heightened understanding of the working principles of
   physical interface modification and the formation of a functional
   gradient. This problem is studied using a functionally graded
   piezoelectric interface composed of vertically aligned lead zirconate
   titanate nanowires, as their piezoelectric properties can be utilized to
   precisely control the strain on one side of the interface. The
   displacement and strain across the nanowire interface is captured using
   digital image correlation. It is demonstrated that the material gradient
   created through nanowires cause a smooth strain transfer from
   reinforcement phase into matrix phase that eliminates the stress
   concentration between these phases, which have highly mismatched
   elasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Piezoelectric nanowires, in particular zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires, have
   been vastly used in the fabrication of electromechanical devices to
   convert wasted mechanical energy into useful electrical energy. Over
   recent years, the growth of vertically aligned ZnO nanowires on various
   structural fibers has led to the development of fiber-based
   nanostructured energy harvesting devices. However, the development of
   more realistic energy harvesters that are capable of continuous power
   generation requires a sufficient mechanical strength to withstand
   typical structural loading conditions. Yet, a durable, multifunctional
   material system has not been developed thoroughly enough to generate
   electrical power without deteriorating the mechanical performance. Here,
   a hybrid composite energy harvester is fabricated in a hierarchical
   design that provides both efficient power generating capabilities while
   enhancing the structural properties of the fiber reinforced polymer
   composite. Through a simple and low-cost process, a modified aramid
   fabric with vertically aligned ZnO nanowires grown on the fiber surface
   is embedded between woven carbon fabrics, which serve as the structural
   reinforcement as well as the top and the bottom electrodes of the
   nanowire arrays. The performance of the developed multifunctional
   composite is characterized through direct vibration excitation and
   tensile strength examination.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past few decades, the increasing demand for self powered
   devices has led to an immense amount of research in the field of energy
   harvesting from renewable mechanical energies. Often, most of thee
   abundant energy sources are wasted in the form of structural vibrations,
   acoustic waves or impact energy. Recently, nano-electromechanical sys
   tens (NEMS) consisting of piezoelectric nanowires have shown excellent
   electromechanical coupling coefficients which can efficiently convert
   small amplitude vibrations into useful electrical energy for compact and
   low power wireless electronic devices. Specifically, high aspect ratio
   piezoelectric nanowires have shown to have a better deformability and
   hence produce higher piezoelectric response to low level induced stress.
   However, current materials are not well suited for energy harvesting
   from extreme environments. In this study, ultra-long high aspect ratio
   vertically aligned lead titanate nanowires (45 gm long, AR = 75) are
   synthesized through a two-step hydrothermal reaction in which s odium
   titanate nanowires serve as the precursor. Their application in
   harvesting vibrational energy at temperatures above 300 degrees C is
   demonstrated through the characterization of open circuit voltage and
   power measurements. The results show that the ultra-long vertically
   aligned lead titanate nanowire array energy harvester can produce up to
   22.3 mW m(-2) at room temperature and up to 13 mW m(-2) at 375 degrees
   C. Thus, it is shown that the energy harvester can provide enough energy
   density for many self-powered, high-temperature applications.}},

Abstract = {{Secondary organic aerosols (SOA) were produced by the photooxidation of
   the volatile organic hydrocarbons (VOCs) isoprene, alpha-pinene and
   toluene, in the presence of excess amounts of sulfuric acid seed aerosol
   with varying NOx concentrations using a large, outdoor smog chamber.
   Aerosol acidity ({[} H+], mu mol m(-3)) was measured using colorimetry
   integrated with a reflectance UV-visible spectrometer (C-RUV). The C-RUV
   technique measures aerosol acidity changes through the neutralisation of
   sulfuric acid with ammonia and the formation of dialkylsulfate, a
   diester of sulfuric acid. The concentration (mu mol m(-3)) of
   dialkylsulfate in aerosol was estimated using the difference in {[} H+]
   obtained from C-RUV and particle-into-liquid-sampler ion chromatography
   (PILS-IC). The yield of dialkylsulfate (YdiOS) was defined as the
   dialkylsulfate concentration normalised by the concentrations of both
   the ammonium-free sulfate ({[}SO42-](free) = {[}SO42-] - 0.5 {[} NH4+])
   and organic carbon. The highestY(diOS) appeared in isopreneSOA and the
   lowestY(diOS) in alpha-pinene SOA. Under our experimental conditions,
   more than 50\% of the total sulfates in sulfuric acid-seeded isoprene
   SOA were dialkylsulfates. For all SOA, higher YdiOS was observed under
   higher NOx conditions (VOC (ppb C)/NO (ppb) < 15). Among the major
   functional groups (-COOH, -CO-H, -CHO and -ONO2) predicted to be present
   using a simple absorptive partitioning model of organic products in the
   multiphase system (gas, organic aerosol and inorganic aerosol), the
   concentrations of -CO-H, -CHO and -ONO2 groups were found to be
   correlated with Y-diOS. In particular, a strong correlation was observed
   between Y-diOS and the concentration of alcohol functional groups.}},

Abstract = {{Coupled electrostatic-structural interaction needs to be modeled for
   designing many electrostatically actuated devices such as MEMS switches,
   accelerometers and comb-drives. The models for such devices must include
   an assembly of components and the air gaps between them. The
   electrostatic fields are generated in the air gaps and this field
   produces electrostatic forces which act on the structural components
   causing deformation and strains. Generating an appropriate mesh for such
   an assembly of regions with different material properties can be
   cumbersome. In this paper, we have developed an immersed boundary
   approach where the geometry is defined using the equations of the
   boundary and is immersed in a uniform background mesh. The loads and
   boundary conditions are imposed using the implicit boundary method since
   the nodes of the background mesh are not guaranteed to be on the
   boundaries. This approach is verified by applying it to commonly used
   examples.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the physics of microscale heat transfer events at the
   wall-fluid interface during the growth of a moving bubble in a
   microchannel is analyzed. The study is enabled through development of a
   novel device that utilizes 53 microscale platinum resistance temperature
   detectors (RTDs) embedded in a composite substrate made of a high
   thermal conductivity material coated by a thin layer of a low thermal
   conductivity material. This sensors arrangement enables resolving the
   thermal field at the bubble-wall interface with unprecedented spatial
   and temporal resolutions of 40-65 mu m and 50 mu s, respectively. To
   prevent random bubble inception, a 300 nm in diameter cavity is
   fabricated using a focused ion beam (FIB) at the center of a pulsed
   function microheater. A detailed analysis of the surface heat transfer
   events and their relations to time scale of formation and dimensions of
   bubbles are conducted to decipher the underlying physics of the flow
   boiling process. Experimental results show that four mechanisms of heat
   transfer are active as a bubble grows and flows through the channel.
   These mechanisms of heat transfer are 1) microlayer evaporation, 2)
   interline evaporation, 3) transient conduction, and 4) micro-convection.
   The results suggest that the average surface heat flux enhances as the
   bubble grows in size resulting in expansion of the surface area over
   which the thin film evaporation mechanism is active. Above a certain
   bubble size, the average surface heat flux declines due to the formation
   of a dry region at the bubble-wall interface. Hence, the results
   indicate that there is an optimal bubble length at which the average
   surface heat flux is maximum.}},

   deliver reagents automatically, and display test results, all of which
   will make mu PADs more suitable for point-of-care applications.}},

Abstract = {{Thermally responsive self-healing polyurethanes (1DA1T, 1.5DA1T, and
   2DA1H) with shape memory property were developed and the fully
   reversible Diels-Alder (DA) and retro Diels-Alder (rDA) reactions were
   employed for the healing mechanism. The transition temperatures of the
   DA and rDA reactions were confirmed through a differential scanning
   calorimetry and the molecular level of analysis on the reversibility and
   the repeatability between the DA and rDA reactions were completed though
   a variable temperature proton nuclear magnetic resonance at the reaction
   temperatures. Also, compact tension specimens were made to observe the
   healing efficiencies. These specimens were healed without the use of
   external forces to close the crack surfaces after testing for the
   repeatable healing ability with three cycles. As a result, the average
   first healing cycle efficiencies of 80\%, 84\%, and 96\% for 1DA1T,
   1.5DA1T and 2DA1H, respectively, were achieved and small drops for the
   second and third healing cycles were observed. Then, using two of the
   self-healing polyurethanes as resins, continuous carbon fiber fabric
   reinforced polymer matrix composites (C1.5DA1T and C2DA1H) were
   fabricated and short beam shear testing was conducted to determine the
   healing capability on the delamination. Accordingly, the first healing
   efficiencies of 88\% and 85\% were measured without any additional
   treatments on the fibers; however, an external pressure was applied
   during the composite healing process.}},

Abstract = {{Focus of this paper is on the prediction accuracy of multidimensional
   functions at an inaccessible point. The paper explores the possibility
   of extrapolating a high-dimensional function using multiple
   one-dimensional converging lines. The main idea is to select samples
   along lines towards the inaccessible point. Multi-dimensional
   extrapolation is thus transformed into a series of one-dimensional
   extrapolations that provide multiple estimates at the inaccessible
   point. We demonstrate the perfonaance of converging lines using Kriging
   to extrapolate a two-dimensional drag coefficient function.
   Post-processing of extrapolation results from different lines based on
   Bayesian theory is proposed to combine the multiple predictions.
   Selection of lines is also discussed. The method of converging lines
   proves to be more robust and reliable than two-dimensional Kriging
   surrogate for the example.}},

Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{63}},
Pages = {{58617-58627}},
Abstract = {{The photocatalytic effect of Arizona Test Dust (ATD) particles on SO2
   oxidation was investigated in both the absence and the presence of
   atmospheric oxidants (e.g., NOx and O-3) under varying relative humidity
   (RH) using a 2 m(3) indoor photo-irradiation chamber. To the best of our
   knowledge, this is the first time that the kinetic rate constant has
   been determined for heterogeneous photooxidation of SO2 in the presence
   of airborne mineral dust particles. Chamber-generated sulfate data,
   measured using a particle into liquid sampler coupled with ion
   chromatography, were used to estimate the kinetic uptake coefficient
   (gamma SO42-) of SO2 corresponding to sulfate production on ATD
   particles. The gamma SO42- value (gamma SO42-,(dark)) in the presence of
   UV light was significantly higher than that (gamma SO42-,(dark))
   obtained in the dark. For example, gamma SO42-,(light) was (1.15 +/-
   0.17) x 10(-5) and gamma SO42-,(dark) was (1.16 +/- 0.11) x 10(-6) at
   20\% RH. Both gamma SO42-,(light) and gamma SO42-,(dark) values
   increased exponentially as RH increased from 20\% to 81\%. The
   heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation of SO2 was also considerably
   enhanced by both O-3 and NO2. To characterize the reaction between
   sulfuric acid and inorganic species of dust particles, aerosol acidity
   ({[}H+](C-RUV), mu mol L-1 by aerosol volume) was measured using
   colorimetry integrated with a reflectance UV-Visible spectrometer. Under
   the experimental conditions employed (sulfate : dust particle = 1 : 20
   in mass), the value determined for {[}H+](C-RUV) was much lower than the
   value of {[} H+] determined from the concentrations of sulfate and
   ammonium ions measured using ion chromatography, suggesting that most
   sulfuric acid reacted with alkaline components of ATD particles.}},

Abstract = {{Zinc stannate porous nanostructured compositions of nanoparticles are
   produced in the form of thin films by means of the chemical vapor
   deposition method. The phase, composition and surface condition of the
   layers as formed by the above route are investigated. Under the
   application of an alternating electric field the electrical properties
   of the layer change under acetone vapor exposure at room temperature. As
   a result of this interaction the radius of the semi-circle on the
   Nyquist diagram is reduced and the centre of the semi-circle on the plot
   is shifted to the higher frequency. To describe the
   resistance-capacitance properties of the samples the characteristic time
   of charge accumulation at the atmosphere and under acetone vapor
   exposure is estimated. The values of the gas sensitivity in the
   frequency range from 1 Hz to 50 KHz is calculated in two ways based on
   the real and imaginary components of the complex impedance.}},

Title = {{A Novel Trust Inference Framework for Web-Based Scenarios Harnessed by
   Social Network and Web of Trust - a Heuristic Approach}},
Journal = {{INFORMATICA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{27}},

Pages = {{405-432}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel trust inference framework in the
   web-based scenarios which are assumed to have a Web of Trust
   pre-established, and take the contexts of the trust relationships into
   account when inferring the recommendation trust. For alleviating the
   problem of sparse matrix in the Web of Trust, we also incorporate the
   users' profile and relationship information on the associated social
   networks into the framework. Based on the Web of Trust established in
   the discussed web-based scenario (i.e. epinions.com in this paper), and
   the social relationship information in the associated social networks,
   the users are classified into four classes. Then different information
   is used to infer the users' recommendation trust value based on the
   classifications. The simulation experiments show that our approach has
   good coverage of inferred trust values, and the accurate rate of the
   predicted trust relationship is higher than the traditional PCC (Pearson
   Correlation Co-efficiency). According to the computation results of
   adjusted parameters, it can be concluded that the threshold which is
   used to filter the inferred trust values can be removed, i.e. all the
   inferred trust values should be kept.}},

Abstract = {{Important drivers of woody cover in African savannas are rainfall, soil
   and nutrients, and disturbance factors, such as fire and herbivory.
   However, very little is known about how these drivers influence woody
   cover at specific height classes. The main aim of this study was to
   identify which of these drivers are the best predictors of woody cover
   at three height classes: shrub (0.75-2.5 m), brush (2.5-5.5 m) and tree
   (>5.5 m). Percent woody cover estimates were collected using a rapid
   monitoring technique over 1 700 sites in Kruger National Park, South
   Africa. Geology (basalt and granite), mean annual rainfall, fire
   frequency and elephant density were analysed as potential drivers of
   woody cover. Results indicate that mean annual rainfall was negatively
   associated with shrub cover, fire frequency was negatively associated
   with brush cover, and elephant density was negatively associated with
   tree cover. Patterns of woody cover show that while geology influences
   the spatial distribution of horizontal woody cover, variation in
   vertical vegetation structure is created and maintained by top-down
   disturbance. This provides the first documentation of drivers associated
   with structurally differentiated woody cover at regional scales. Future
   studies on woody cover in disturbance-driven environments should not
   ignore vegetation structure.}},

Abstract = {{Colloidal nanoplatelets (NPLs) have recently been introduced as
   semiconductor emissive materials for the fabrication of quantum dot
   light-emitting diodes (QLED) on account of their ultra-narrow
   photoluminescence (PL) linewidth. In this paper, we report a multilayer
   all solution-processed green QLED based on colloidal CdSe/CdS core/shell
   NPLs with a narrow PL full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of 12 nm. Our
   characterization results reveal that this kind of NPL containing QLED
   exhibit a low operating voltage of 2.25 V and a maximum luminance up to
   33 000 cd m(-2), and peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5\%,
   corresponding to 12.5 cd A(-1) in luminance efficiency. Particularly,
   these devices show ultra-high color purity for electroluminescence (EL)
   with FWHM of 14 nm. As extremely narrow EL and ultra-pure color is
   highly attractive in the applications of LED industries, this work
   signifies the unique potential application of one new class of colloidal
   core/shell NPLs in achieving bright and efficient LEDs with superior
   color saturation.}},

Abstract = {{A novel experimental technique was developed to visualize and control
   single bubble cavitation initiation, growth, and its collapse. The
   influence of this process on a nearby tissue surrogate was investigated
   and then extended to a rat brain tissue. The technique utilized a
   modified polymer Hopkinson pressure bar system which transmits a
   simulated blast pressure wave with over and under pressure components to
   a fluid-filled test chamber implanted with a seed gas bubble. Growth and
   collapse of this bubble was visually recorded with a high speed camera.
   Using Raleigh-Plessat equation, bubble collapse pressures 29-125 times
   that of peak blast overpressure are predicted to be the source of
   localized shock waves. Finally, the value of this experimental platform
   to investigate the single bubble cavitation-induced fluid jet impact on
   a rat brain tissue and the associated damage evolution is illustrated.}},

Title = {{Solvent effects on modulus of poly(propylene oxide)-based organogels as

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},

Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{4991-5001}},
Abstract = {{A series of novel organogels were synthesized from poly(propylene oxide)
   (PPO) functionalized with main chain urea moieties which provided rapid
   gelation and high moduli in a variety of solvents. Three different
   molecular weight PPOs were used in this study: 430, 2000, and 4000 g
   mol(-1), each with alpha,omega-amino-end groups. Four urea groups were
   introduced into the main chain by reaction with hexamethylene
   diisocyanate followed by subsequent reaction with a monofunctional alkyl
   or aromatic amine. This PPO/urea gelator was found to form gels in
   carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, dichloromethane, toluene, ethyl
   acetate, and tetrahydrofuran. Among these, carbon tetrachloride and
   toluene were found to be the best solvents for this system, resulting in
   perfectly clear gels with high moduli at low mass fraction for PPO-2000
   systems. Flory-Huggins polymer-solvent interaction parameter, chi, was
   found to be a useful indicator of gel quality for these systems, with
   chi(CCl4)/(PPO-2000) < 0.5 and chi(toluene)/PPO-2000 approximate to 0.5.
   Systems with chi parameters >0.5 were found to form low moduli gels,
   indicating that for these systems, polymer-solvent interaction
   parameters can be a useful predictor of gel quality in different solvent
   systems.}},

Title = {{pulSED: pulsed sonoelectrodeposition of fractal nanoplatinum for
   enhancing amperometric biosensor performance}},
Journal = {{ANALYST}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{3367-3378}},
Abstract = {{For the first time, we combine pulsed electrodeposition with
   out-of-phase pulsed sonication for controlled synthesis of fractal
   nanoplatinum structures as the transducer layer in electrochemical
   sensing. We develop and test this technique, called bimodal pulsed
   sonoelectrodeposition (pulSED), as a simple approach for creating highly
   conductive transducer nanometals for use in sensing and biosensing. We
   first compared the efficiency of pulSED nanoplatinum to other pulsed
   electrodeposition techniques, and then explored the effect of duty cycle
   and plating time on electroactive surface area and nanoparticle
   size/morphology. The developed pulSED nanoplatinum displayed fractal
   features with a relatively homogenous size distribution (26.31 +/- 1.3
   nm) and extremely high electroactive surface (0.28 +/- 0.04 cm(2))
   relative to other electroplating techniques (up to one order of
   magnitude higher). A high duty cycle (900 mHz) promotes formation of
   stable nanostructures (including fractal nanostructures) and reduces
   amorphous structure formation due to bubble cavitation and enhanced mass
   transport of metal ions to the electrode surface. To demonstrate the
   applicability of the pulSED technique, non-enzymatic and enzymatic
   sensors were developed for measuring hydrogen peroxide and glucose. The
   sensitivity for non-enzymatic peroxide sensing (3335 +/- 305 mu A cm(-2)
   mM(-1)), non-enzymatic glucose sensing (73 +/- 14 mu A cm(-2) mM(-1))
   and enzymatic glucose biosensing (155 +/- 25 mu A cm(-2) mM(-1)) was
   higher than, or similar to, other nanomaterial-mediated amperometric
   sensors reported in the literature. The pulSED technique is a one pot
   method for tunable synthesis of nanometal structures as a transducer
   layer in electrochemical sensing and biosensing that requires no
   precursors or capping agents, and can be carried out at room temperature
   with inexpensive hardware.}},

Title = {{Triplet excited state properties in variable gap pi-conjugated
   donor-acceptor-donor chromophores}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{3621-3631}},
Abstract = {{A series of variable band-gap donor-acceptor-donor (DAD) chromophores
   capped with platinum(II) acetylide units has been synthesized and fully
   characterized by electrochemical and photophysical methods, with
   particular emphasis placed on probing triplet excited state properties.
   A counter-intuitive trend of increasing fluorescence quantum efficiency
   and lifetime with decreasing excited state energy (optical gap) is
   observed across the series of DAD chromophores. Careful study of the
   excited state dynamics, including triplet yields (as inferred from
   singlet oxygen sensitization), reveals that the underlying origin of the
   unusual trend in the fluorescence parameters is that the singlet-triplet
   intersystem crossing rate and yield decrease with decreasing optical
   gap. It is concluded that the rate of intersystem crossing decreases as
   the LUMO is increasingly localized on the acceptor unit in the DAD
   chromophore, and this result is interpreted as arising because the
   extent of spin-orbit coupling induced by the platinum heavy metal
   centers decreases as the LUMO is more localized on the acceptor. In
   addition to the trend in intersystem crossing, the results show that the
   triplet decay rates follow the Energy Gap Law correlation over a 1.8 eV
   range of triplet energy and 1000-fold range of triplet decay rates.
   Finally, femtosecond transient absorption studies for the DAD
   chromophores reveals a strong absorption in the near-infrared region
   which is attributed to the singlet excited state. This spectral band
   appears to be general for DAD chromophores, and may be a signature of
   the charge transfer (CT) singlet excited state.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things (IoT) consists of embedded low-power devices that
   collect and transmit data to centralized head nodes that process and
   analyze the data, and drive actions. The proliferation of these
   connected low-power devices will result in a data explosion that will
   significantly increase data transmission costs with respect to energy
   consumed and latency. Edge computing performs computations at the edge
   nodes prior to data transmission to interpret and/or utilize the data,
   thus reducing transmission costs. In this work, we seek to understand
   the interactions between IoT applications' execution characteristics
   (e.g., compute/memory intensity, cache miss rates, etc.) and the edge
   nodes' microarchitectural characteristics (e.g., clock frequency, memory
   capacity, etc.) for efficient and effective edge computing. Thus, we
   present a broad and tractable IoT application classification methodology
   and using this classification, we analyze the microarchitectural
   characteristics of a wide range of state-of-the-art embedded system
   microprocessors and evaluate the microprocessors' applicability to IoT
   computation using various evaluation metrics. We also investigate and
   quantify the impact of leakage power reduction on the overall energy
   consumption across different architectures. Our work provides insights
   into the microarchitectural characteristics' impact on system
   performance and efficiency for various IoT application requirements. Our
   work also provides a foundation for the analysis and design of a diverse
   set of microprocessor architectures for IoT edge computing.}},

Abstract = {{Water-based humic substances-silsesquioxane (HS-SQ) soft materials are
   synthesized by hydrolysis of (3-aminopropyl-triethoxy)-silane in the HS
   solution. The aggregation dynamics of this system was studied using in
   situ small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) technique, which revealed three
   consecutive stages in the evolution of the HS-SQ system based on its
   fractal dimension (D): HS-SQ oligomeric polyelectrolyte complexes with D
   < 2.5; loosely bound HS-SQ networks with 2.5 < D < 3.0, and densely
   cross-linked networks with D > 3 (surface fractals). It was suggested
   that the reaction time needed for the HS-SQ system to transit from mass
   to surface fractal stage can be used to control its self-assembly onto a
   solid support. The corresponding studies have confirmed that the HS-SQ
   networks could be successfully immobilized onto sand columns only at the
   aggregation stage with fractal dimensions of 2.5 < D-m < 3. This enabled
   the targeted design of HS-SQ systems capable of guided self-assembly
   onto the solid support. The corresponding lab column studies have
   demonstrated successful passive installation of a humic permeable
   reactive barrier on sand which was capable of intercepting azo dyes from
   contaminated water. The prospects of using HS-SQ soft materials in
   nature-inspired remedial technologies and soil restoration are
   discussed.}},

Title = {{Simulating the SOA formation of isoprene from partitioning and aerosol

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{The secondary organic aerosol (SOA) produced by the photooxidation of
   isoprene with and without inorganic seed is simulated using the Unified
   Partitioning Aerosol Phase Reaction (UNIPAR) model. Recent work has
   found the SOA formation of isoprene to be sensitive to both aerosol
   acidity ({[}H+], molaEuro-L-1) and aerosol liquid water content (LWC)
   with the presence of either leading to significant aerosol phase organic
   mass generation and large growth in SOA yields (Y-SOA). Classical
   partitioning models alone are insufficient to predict isoprene SOA
   formation due to the high volatility of photooxidation products and
   sensitivity of their mass yields to variations in inorganic aerosol
   composition. UNIPAR utilizes the chemical structures provided by a
   near-explicit chemical mechanism to estimate the thermodynamic
   properties of the gas phase products, which are lumped based on their
   calculated vapor pressure (eight groups) and aerosol phase reactivity
   (six groups). UNIPAR then determines the SOA formation of each lumping
   group from both partitioning and aerosol phase reactions
   (oligomerization, acid-catalyzed reactions and organosulfate formation)
   assuming a single homogeneously mixed organic-inorganic phase as a
   function of inorganic composition and VOCaEuro-a center dot aEuro-NOx
   (VOC - volatile organic compound). The model is validated using isoprene
   photooxidation experiments performed in the dual, outdoor University of
   Florida Atmospheric PHotochemical Outdoor Reactor (UF APHOR) chambers.
   UNIPAR is able to predict the experimental SOA formation of isoprene
   without seed, with H2SO4 seed gradually titrated by ammonia, and with
   the acidic seed generated by SO2 oxidation. Oligomeric mass is predicted
   to account for more than 65aEuro-\% of the total organic mass formed in
   all cases and over 85aEuro-\% in the presence of strongly acidic seed.
   The model is run to determine the sensitivity of Y-SOA to {[}H+], LWC
   and VOCaEuro-a center dot aEuro-NOx, and it is determined that the SOA
   formation of isoprene is most strongly related to {[}H+] but is
   dynamically related to all three parameters. For VOCaEuro-a center dot
   aEuro-NO(x)aEuro- > aEuro-10, with increasing NOx both experimental and
   simulated Y-SOA increase and are found to be more sensitive to {[}H+]
   and LWC. For atmospherically relevant conditions, Y-SOA is found to be
   more than 150aEuro-\% higher in partially titrated acidic seeds
   (NH4HSO4) than in effloresced inorganics or in isoprene only.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POROUS MEDIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{233-245}},
Abstract = {{A primary parameter for gauging performance of a particular porous mesh
   screen is the bubble point pressure, or differential pressure across a
   screen pore that overcomes the surface tension of the liquid at that
   pore. The general trend that has been assumed throughout the literature
   is that the finer the mesh, the higher the bubble point. This assumption
   is based on the view that higher mesh counts have smaller absolute
   micron ratings, which lead to higher capillary pressures. Recently
   collected experimental results in both storable and cryogenic liquids
   show clear evidence that negates this long-held assumption. Analysis
   shows that it is not just the fineness of the mesh, but also the shute
   to warp diameter ratio, that controls the bubble breakthrough pressure.
   Based on results, the 450 x 2750 Dutch Twill mesh has the optimal pore
   geometry which maximizes the bubble point pressure.}},

Journal = {{PROGRESS IN COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{163-178}},
Abstract = {{In this study, the fluid flow around an elliptic cylinder inclined to
   the free-stream was investigated for Reynolds numbers ranging from 20 to
   100. The direct-forcing/fictitious domain (DF/FD) method was used to
   simulate the flow around the elliptic cylinder whose aspect ratio was
   0.2 at angles of incidence ranging from 0 degrees to 90 degrees. The
   resultant instantaneous flow fields and patterns were then compared with
   those available in existing literature, and it was found that they
   compared favourably. The transition from steady to unsteady flow was
   shown using a stability diagram. An increase in the angle of incidence
   contributed to a decrease in the critical Reynolds number at which the
   flow became unsteady. In general, as the angle of incidence increased,
   the value of the Strouhal number decreased for a given Reynolds number.
   We also constructed a bifurcation diagram in order to distinguish the
   existence of recirculation regions behind the elliptic cylinder. Various
   characteristics of flow, such as Strouhal number, stagnation point, and
   drag and lift coefficients as a function of the angle of incidence were
   investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Most soil moisture sensor systems (SMSs) marketed for landscape
   irrigation respond to the dielectric permittivity of the soil. Compared
   to potable water (PW), reclaimed water (RW) may contain more salts,
   which can modify the dielectric permittivity of the soil and, hence,
   alter the readings of SMSs when measuring the soil water content. The
   main objectives of this experiment were to evaluate the functionality of
   four SMS brands and to quantify potential irrigation savings. Secondary
   objectives were to analyze the behavior consistency of three units
   within a brand to control irrigation, and to compare the brands. The
   experiment was carried out in Gainesville, Florida, under turfgrass
   plots irrigated with PW in 2009 and RW with an average salinity of 0.75
   dS/m during 2010. Four SMS brands (Acclima, AquaSpy, Baseline, and
   Dynamax) were selected and compared to a treatment without sensor
   feedback (WOS). Even though replicates of AquaSpy were statistically
   different under both PW and RW, all SMSs tested applied significantly
   less water than WOS. Water savings ranged 46\%- 78\% under PW, and 45\%-
   68\% under RW. Therefore, SMSs can be a useful tool for conserving water
   on turfgrass irrigated with either PW or RW.}},

Abstract = {{Water savings potential of soil moisture sensor irrigation control
   technologies have not been reported in homes irrigating with reclaimed
   water (RW). The main objective of this research was to evaluate the
   performance and water conservation potential of a soil moisture sensor
   system (SMS) in homes that used RW as their source for irrigation, as
   compared to homes with irrigation timers only, or to homes with
   educational materials and/or rain sensors. Secondary objectives were to:
   a) estimate the water depth applied by the different technologies
   compared to a theoretical requirement (calculated using a daily soil
   water balance), and b) estimate the effects of local watering
   restrictions on the amount of RW used by homeowners. In the vicinity of
   Palm Harbor, Florida, a total of 64 homes supplied with reclaimed water
   for irrigation (with an average salinity of 0.7 dS/m) were selected for
   this study. Dedicated irrigation flowmeters were installed in every
   home. The 64 homes were divided in 4 treatments with 16 homes each.
   Treatments were: MO (monitored only), SMS, rain sensor, and rain sensor
   plus educational materials. The SMS treatment was the only group of
   homes significantly different to MO, reducing the average number of
   irrigation events per week (1.7 vs. 2.7 events/week, respectively),
   decreasing the depth of the weekly irrigation (22 vs. 42 mm,
   respectively), and applying 44\% less water, over the 32 months of data
   collection. These results indicate that the tested SMS can save a
   significant amount of RW, compared to the other methods/technologies
   investigated. Even when all treatments over-irrigated most of the time,
   SMS irrigated most properly, compared to a theoretical requirement.
   Finally, under severe dry weather conditions, the local watering
   restrictions promoted a more efficient use of the RW.}},

Abstract = {{A methodology to estimate residential irrigation using monthly metered
   total water use and metered irrigation data is presented here in a case
   study in central Florida. The objective of this article was to determine
   the most accurate method of indoor/outdoor water use separation for
   single-family homes. In this study, 1781 homes located in Orlando,
   Florida, were analyzed. The analysis was based on monthly billing
   records for the January 2006-June 2009 period where total metered water
   use and separately metered irrigation data were available. Residential
   irrigation was estimated based on minimum month and per capita methods
   to derive indoor use, and by assuming three different irrigable areas
   for each home. Average total water use was 70.4 m(3) month(-1) and
   average observed irrigation was 45.8 m(3) month-1. This method was
   calibrated and validated using metered irrigation data. Metered
   irrigation data indicated that irrigation accounted for 64\% of the
   total water use. Observed indoor water use was fairly constant across
   the year with an average of 24.6 +/- 1.3 m(3) month(-1), and values were
   compared to those estimated by the minimum month method and the per
   capita method. The minimum month method over-estimated indoor water use
   as 61.3 m(3) month(-1) whereas the per capita method estimated the value
   as 16.9 m(3) month(-1). Observed annual cumulative irrigation was 60\%
   higher than the gross irrigation requirement and this excess irrigation
   varied from 10\% to more than 300\% depending on month with most excess
   in the winter months. The calibration and validation demonstrated that
   around 60\% to 99\% of the variability of the observed data can be
   reproduced by this proposed method. However, this approach maintains a
   limited area of potential application just for central Florida.}},

Title = {{IMPORTANCE OF ET CONTROLLER PROGRAM SETTINGS ON WATER CONSERVATION
   POTENTIAL}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{251-262}},
Abstract = {{In unincorporated Orange County, Florida, 57\% to 62\% of single-family
   residential homes were found to regularly over-irrigate, resulting in
   the need to find better ways to schedule automatic irrigation. The
   objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of programming
   for identical virtual landscapes to further explore the water savings
   potential of evapotranspiration (ET) controllers. As a virtual test,
   three Rain Bird ET controllers were studied: the ESP-SMT controller with
   two firmware options (original and an updated), and the ESP-SMTe, a
   replacement product for the ESP-SMT. Irrigation was scheduled for a
   virtual central Florida landscape by altering possible program settings
   of plant type, microclimate, soil type, and density that relate directly
   to parameters used in the soil water balance. The ESP-SMTe consistently
   applied similar amounts of irrigation to the ESP-SMT with updated
   firmware, indicating that controller updates were minor between the two
   models. The settings were optimized for Florida landscapes by selecting
   a heavier soil type, increasing the shade, and selecting a medium stand
   for a custom plant type, resulting in reductions in irrigation
   application. The ESP-SMTe and ESP-SMT with updated firmware were
   different from the ESP-SMT with original firmware, where newer models
   applied more water despite identical settings, averaging 12 to 21 mm
   more per month than the original firmware. Additionally, all of the
   controllers were unable to fully account for rainfall throughout the
   test resulting in a minimum of 51\% in over-irrigation compared to the
   gross irrigation requirement (GIR). Increasing the accuracy of rainfall
   accounting would be extremely beneficial to overall water conservation
   and efficiency. In a separate, independent ET controller study, there
   was a large discrepancy in irrigation application among multiple brands
   programmed to irrigate the same virtual landscape. This further shows
   the importance of understanding the algorithms behind the program
   settings.}},

   liposomes: demonstration of effect in dabigatran-induced anticoagulation}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{428-433}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Liposomes have recently emerged as rational vehicles for
   drug detoxification. Modification of the core pH may further enhance the
   ability of liposomes to sequester lipophilic toxins that are weak bases.
   Dabigatran, a reversible inhibitor of thrombin, has been widely promoted
   as a novel oral anticoagulant. As a lipophilic weak-base, it provides a
   rational target for reversal with acidic-centred liposomal preparations.
   The present study tests the hypothesis that acidic centre liposomes will
   reverse dabigatran induced anticoagulation. Method: Following enteric
   dabigatran dosing in vitro assessment of thrombin clotting times (TCT)
   was undertaken in rabbit plasma spiked with incremental liposome
   concentrations. Tail vein bleeding was assessed following intravenous
   liposome injection in rats after enteric dabigatran administration.
   Results: Liposomes achieved reversal of TCT to baseline at low levels of
   thrombin inhibition, and partial reversal of TCT at higher levels.
   Liposomes completely reversed the effects of dabigatran on rat tail vein
   bleeding time (134.0 (6.7) s liposomes vs. 410 (37.8) s control; p <
   0.01). Conclusion: Dabigatran-induced coagulopathy was reversed in vitro
   and in vivo by acidic-centred liposomes. pH-modified liposomes are a
   promising investigational entity in the antidotal treatment of
   pharmacologic weak bases that are lipid soluble at physiologic pH.}},

Title = {{Secure outsourced garbled circuit evaluation for mobile devices}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SECURITY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{137-180}},
Abstract = {{Garbled circuits provide a powerful tool for jointly evaluating
   functions while preserving the privacy of each user's inputs. While
   recent research has made the use of this primitive more practical, such
   solutions generally assume that participants are symmetrically
   provisioned with massive computing resources. In reality, most people on
   the planet only have access to the comparatively sparse computational
   resources associated with their mobile phones, and those willing and
   able to pay for access to public cloud computing infrastructure cannot
   be assured that their data will remain unexposed. We address this
   problem by creating a new SFE protocol that allows mobile devices to
   securely outsource the majority of computation required to evaluate a
   garbled circuit. Our protocol, which builds on the most efficient
   garbled circuit evaluation techniques, includes a new outsourced
   oblivious transfer primitive that requires significantly less bandwidth
   and computation than standard OT primitives and outsourced input
   validation techniques that force the cloud to prove that it is executing
   all protocols correctly. After showing that our extensions are secure in
   the malicious model, we conduct an extensive performance evaluation for
   a number of standard SFE test applications as well as a
   privacy-preserving navigation application designed specifically for the
   mobile use-case. Our system reduces execution time by 98.92\% and
   bandwidth by 99.95\% for the edit distance problem of size 128 compared
   to non-outsourced evaluation. These results show that even the least
   capable devices are capable of using large garbled circuits for secure
   computation.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},

Pages = {{3054-3064}},
Abstract = {{With a growing number of bioactive protein drugs approved for clinical
   use each year, there is increasing need for vehicles for localized
   protein delivery to reduce administered doses, prevent off-target
   activity, and maintain protein bioactivity. Ideal protein delivery
   vehicles provide high encapsulation efficiency of bioactive drug, enable
   fine-tuning of protein release profiles, are biocompatible, and can be
   administered via minimally-invasive routes. Here we developed an
   approach to create micron-sized hydrated gels (i.e. ``microgels'') for
   protein delivery that fulfill these requirements via desolvation of
   self-assembled beta-sheet peptide nanofibers. Specifically, aqueous
   solutions of peptide nanofibers were diluted under stirring conditions
   in a ``desolvating agent'', such as ethanol, which is miscible with
   water but poorly solvates peptides. The desolvating agent induced
   nanofiber physical crosslinking into microgels that retained beta-sheet
   secondary structure and were stable in aqueous solutions. Microgels did
   not activate dendritic cells in vitro, suggesting they are
   biocompatible. Peptide nanofibers and proteins having similar
   non-solvent immiscibility properties were co-desolvated to produce
   protein-loaded microgels with loading efficiencies of similar to 85\%.
   Encapsulated bioactive proteins rapidly diffused into bulk aqueous
   media, as expected for hydrated gels. Modifying peptide nanofibers with
   a protein-binding ligand provided tunable affinity-controlled protein
   release. Biocompatible microgels formed via desolvation of
   self-assembled peptide nanofibers are therefore likely to be broadly
   useful as vehicles for localized delivery of bioactive proteins, as well
   as other therapeutic molecules.}},

Title = {{Identification of trap locations in AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility

Abstract = {{By varying the photon flux during sub-bandgap optical pumping, the
   locations of traps associated with sub-bandgap laser pumping in
   AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) were identified.
   Fixed photon flux of sub-bandgap optical pumping was previously employed
   to determine the activation energies of traps in AlGaN/GaN HEMT; traps
   with activation energies of 0.73 eV, both 0.73 and 1.91 eV or all three
   trap states detected for the 671, 532, or 477 nm laser illumination,
   respectively. However, by illuminating the HEMTs with lower photon
   fluxes from 532 or 447 nm lasers, the traps with 0.73 eV were absent,
   and only the traps associated with higher activation energies were
   activated by the laser light. This indicated that the traps related to
   the activation energies of 1.91 and 2.35 eV are likely located at the
   surface of the HEMTs. Photon flux dependent gate-lag measurements were
   also conducted. Laser illumination of 671 nm did not affect the drain
   current during the gate lag measurement, implying the traps linked to
   the activation energy of 0.73 eV are not present in the AlGaN layer of
   the HEMT structure. On the other hand, the 1.91 and 2.35 eV trap states
   were distributed in the AlGaN layer of the HEMTs. This approach to
   selectively exciting the defect states provides a nondestructive method
   of probing the ionization levels and spatial location of traps in wide
   bandgap heterostructures. (C) 2015 American Vacuum Society.}},

Title = {{REVIEW OF TURFGRASS EVAPOTRANSPIRATION AND CROP COEFFICIENTS}},
Journal = {{TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{207-223}},
Abstract = {{This review summarizes available data related to turfgrass
   evapotranspiration (ETc) and crop coefficients (K-c) for both
   warm-season and cool-season grasses. Daily, monthly, or seasonal ETc
   rates and K-c values determined at different locations in the U.S. are
   shown in this review, as well as the methods used to determine or
   estimate these values. Warm-season turfgrasses are characterized by
   their lower ETc rates compared to cool-season turfgrasses. Results
   showed that ETc is highly variable, not only between species but within
   same species. For example, `Tifway' bermudagrass, a warm-season
   turfgrass, showed ETc values of 1.78 mm d(-1) in central Florida and
   4.83 mm d(-1) in Colorado, whereas zoysiagrass showed an ETc value of
   9.40 mm d(-1) in Texas. On the other hand, creeping bentgrass showed an
   ETc value of 3.3 mm d(-1) for `Pennlinks' variety, while `Seaside'
   showed an ETc value of 10.7 mm d(-1), both in Nebraska. This variability
   was affected by genotype and plant morphological characteristics but was
   also due to weather conditions. Variability was also observed in
   turfgrass K-c. Minimum and maximum monthly K-c values for cool-season
   grasses were estimated as 0.05 and 1.05, respectively; for warm-season
   grasses, monthly K-c values ranged from 0.28 to 0.99. The lowest
   reported K-c values within a turfgrass species could serve as selection
   criteria to breed new varieties resistant to drought or contributing to
   water savings. Evapotranspiration rates and crop coefficients should be
   used with awareness of the local conditions under which the values were
   developed.}},

Title = {{SMARTPHONE APPS FOR IRRIGATION SCHEDULING}},
Journal = {{TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE}},

Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{291-301}},
Abstract = {{SmartIrrigation apps were developed to provide real-time irrigation
   schedules for selected crops (i.e., avocado, citrus, cotton, peanut,
   strawberry, and vegetables). Irrigation schedules in the smartphone apps
   are based on evapotranspiration (ET) or a water balance methodology
   using real-time weather data from the Florida Automated Weather Network
   and the Georgia Environmental Monitoring Network. The FAO
   Penman-Monteith method is used for calculating reference ET, and crop
   coefficients (K-c) are applied based on time after planting, calendar
   month, or a crop's phenological stage. The functionality of each app was
   customized for each user group considering the most common irrigation
   systems used. Custom features include water conservation options,
   splitting irrigation events, spreadsheet output emails, and
   notifications. App inputs vary by crop (primarily due to the irrigation
   system used); however, all apps require root depth, irrigation rate, and
   soil type except the strawberry app. App outputs also vary and include
   estimated reference ET, days between irrigation events, irrigation depth
   and duration, accumulated rain for previous seven days, and growing
   degree days. National Weather Service forecast data are also provided in
   the apps. The apps are available in Android and iOS stores. A limitation
   to the app irrigation schedules is the spatial variation in rainfall,
   given the finite set of weather stations. Future efforts will focus on
   more accurate inclusion of rainfall into the irrigation schedules
   generated by the SmartIrrigation apps.}},

Abstract = {{An overview of various processing and dopant considerations for the
   creation of heavily-doped n-InGaAs is presented. A large body of
   experimental evidence and theoretical prediction point to dopant
   vacancy-complexing as the limiting mechanism for electrical activation
   in heavily Si doped InGaAs and GaAs. Dopant incorporation techniques
   which require thermal treatment steps to move dopants onto lattice sites
   like ion implantation and monolayer doping exhibit stable activation up
   to a limit of approximate to 1.5 x 10(19) cm(-3). Growth-based dopant
   incorporation methods have shown much higher (5 x 10(19) cm(-3)) active
   concentrations but these activate concentrations are shown in multiple
   studies to be metastable. Other device specific process-flow constraints
   with respect to modern CMOS devices which may make some means of dopant
   incorporation method, or species selection more appropriate for a given
   application are also discussed. (C) The Author(s) 2016. Published by

Abstract = {{Purpose: We describe the design and application of a new apparatus for
   applying Radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields to cells in culture
   on a microscope stage. This new design enables real-time studies of the
   actuation of magnetic nanoparticles bound to membrane receptors or
   internalised within cells together with the study of magnetic fluid
   hyperthermia (MFH)-associated effects. Materials and methods: RF coils
   were fabricated and electromagnetic simulations were performed along
   with compatibility evaluations and calorimetric experiments using this
   apparatus at discreet frequencies between 100 kHz and 1 MHz. Cell
   killing via MFH was investigated in a neuroblastoma tumour cell line.
   Results: Simulations and evaluations showed that the field intensity and
   homogeneity experienced by the cells within the chamber is best with a
   planar coil configuration. The incubation chamber was suitable for cell
   culture and the design was compatible with mountings on different makes
   of microscopes as it mimics a standard 96/24/6 tissue-culture well
   plate. Successful calorimetric and MFH cytotoxicity proof-of-principle
   experiments were performed and are presented. Conclusions: We conclude
   from these experiments that alternating magnetic field (AMF)-mediated
   activation and magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH) research will benefit
   from this RF coil that fits inside an incubation chamber, mounted onto a
   microscope. This new design could be used to assist real-time MFH
   studies in vitro.}},

Pages = {{304-309}},
Abstract = {{Precise enumeration of spores is crucial for accurate evaluation of
   spore survival in the presence of inactivating agents or extreme
   environmental conditions. Bacterial endospores tend to agglomerate,
   leading to low estimates of spore numbers. We have shown that addition
   of SDS to diluent used in counting bacterial endospores better disperses
   spores, leading to a ten-fold increase in counts. We attribute this
   effect to steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion between micellar
   structures of SDS adsorbed at spore surfaces. We have also demonstrated
   that use of a low surface energy material (Telon) improves spread-plate
   counts, an effect we attribute to lesser hold-up of liquid on Telon
   versus glass.}},

Title = {{Applying Triple-Matrix Masking for Privacy Preserving Data Collection
   and Sharing in HIV Studies}},
Journal = {{CURRENT HIV RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{121-129}},
Abstract = {{Background: Many HIV research projects are plagued by the high missing
   rate of self reported information during data collection. Also, due to
   the sensitive nature of the HIV research data, privacy protection is
   always a concern for data sharing in HIV studies.
   Methods: This paper applies a data masking approach, called
   triple-matrix masking {[}1], to the context of HIV research for ensuring
   privacy protection during the process of data collection and data
   sharing.
   Results: Using a set of generated HIV patient data, we show step by step
   how the data are randomly transformed (masked) before leaving the
   patients' individual data collection device (which ensures that nobody
   sees the actual data) and how the masked data are further transformed by
   a masking service provider and a data collector. We demonstrate that the
   masked data retain statistical utility of the original data, yielding
   the exactly same inference results in the planned logistic regression on
   the effect of age on the adherence to antiretroviral therapy and in the
   Cox proportional hazard model for the age effect on time to viral load
   suppression.
   Conclusion: Privacy-preserving data collection method may help resolve
   the privacy protection issue in HIV research. The individual sensitive
   data can be completely hidden while the same inference results can still
   be obtained from the masked data, with the use of common statistical
   analysis methods.}},

   Buried Pipe}},
Journal = {{GEOTECHNICAL TESTING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{126-136}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A new apparatus that measures pipe deflection as a function of simulated
   overburden stress is described-the large-scale soil box (LSSB). While
   the LSSB is similar to previous quasi-full scale instruments, it is
   capable of load testing two pipes simultaneously while monitoring
   deflection along their crowns. A series of tests were conducted on 24
   and 36-in., 10-ft-long pipe sections. Pipe material varied throughout
   testing; materials included polyvinylchloride (PVC), high-density
   polyethylene (HDPE), steel, and aluminum. During load application,
   lasers allowed for deflection curves to be developed for each of the
   pipes as a function of simulated overburden produced via constrained
   lift bags. Analysis of the results appeared to indicate that loading in
   the LSSB is not necessarily uniform. This is likely due to non-uniform
   soil densities that were present prior to testing even though strict
   procedures and quality control checks were used prior to each test.
   Therefore, it would be difficult to use data from a device like this as
   a comparison against finite element models. However, results from these
   tests still may be used to assess the relative levels of effect of
   different pipe types and installation procedures.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of implant damage in InGaAs is studied for electrically
   active Si+ and isoelectronic P+ implants. Extrinsic loops formed by
   excess interstitials are shown to be less stable upon annealing for
   n-type Si+ implants relative to isoelectronic P+ implants. Damage
   created by P+ implants into heavily n-doped InGaAs is also shown to be
   less stable than damage created by P+ implants into unintentionally
   doped InGaAs indicating that the background doping concentration can
   significantly effect the evolution of implant damage upon annealing.
   Previous results have suggested that the electrical activation and
   diffusion behavior of n-type dopants, like Si in InGaAs, may be strongly
   influenced by vacancy concentration. TEM results in this study also
   suggest that heavy n-type doping in InGaAs results in the formation of a
   large population of vacancy defects that enhance the dissolution or
   inhibit formation of interstitial loops. (c) 2015 The Electrochemical

Title = {{Three-dimensional quantification of composition and electrostatic

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{14}},
Pages = {{5167-5175}},
Abstract = {{Despite typically comprising a small volume fraction, grain boundaries
   often limit many properties of ceramics for energy technologies. The
   localized charges present at grain boundaries affect local structure and
   composition which thus impact the ionic conductivities along with
   thermal, electrical, optical, magnetic, and mechanical properties. While
   theory regarding grain boundary effects has progressed, direct knowledge
   of the local chemistry and corresponding potential around individual
   boundaries remains elusive. Some model bicrystal systems have been
   well-characterized experimentally; however, the complexities of random
   grain boundary structures in bulk-prepared polycrystalline ceramics have
   prevented quantified analysis of the most commonly occurring types.
   Here, the three-dimensional quantification of oxygen and cation
   compositions around arbitrarily selected high-angle grain boundaries in
   a polycrystalline material as measured by atom probe tomography are used
   to extract nm-scale, quantitative values of the three-dimensional
   space-charge potentials around grain boundaries and are related to the
   observed macro-scale conductivities. We focus specifically on Nd-doped
   ceria, a well-known ion conducting oxide with significant energy
   applications. However, the techniques employed here are directly
   applicable to other technologically-relevant polycrystalline ceramics
   and create opportunities for correlating nano-scale composition with
   macro-scale properties for optimizing materials design, expanding
   progress in ionic chemistry theory, and refining simulations for
   ``real-world{''} polycrystalline materials.}},

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{The effects of CO2 activation temperature (600-900 degrees C) and time
   (1 and 2 h) on the physicochemical and sorptive characteristics of
   hickory and peanut hull hydrochars were investigated. The extent of
   burn-off increased with increasing activation times and temperatures,
   and ranged from 34-54\% and 28-50\% for activated hydrochars (AHCs),
   respectively. The surface area and pore volume of the AHCs also
   increased with activation time and temperature and were much higher than
   those of their corresponding nonactivated parent hydrochars. In general,
   the physical activation improved the ability of all AHCs to sorb
   methylene blue, lead (Pb2+), copper (Cu2+), and cadmium (Cd2+) from
   aqueous solutions. AHCs created at 900 degrees C had the best sorption
   ability, and the highest sorption rate was usually observed in 900
   degrees C 2 h AHCs. The sorption of methylene blue and the three heavy
   metals was strongly correlated with AHC surface area, suggesting that
   the adsorption occurred via site-specific interactions.}},

Title = {{Potential Role of Polyphenols in the Prevention of Cardiovascular
   Diseases: Molecular Bases}},
Journal = {{CURRENT MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{115-128}},
Abstract = {{Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of mortality
   worldwide. It is widely accepted that oxidative stress plays a key role
   in their development and progression; hence oxidative damage might be
   abrogated by antioxidants. Polyphenols are phytochemicals showing
   extensively studied antioxidant properties in-vivo. Most representative
   sources of these compounds include fruits, greens, nuts, herbs, cocoa,
   tea and coffee. Epidemiological evidence suggests an association between
   the consumption of polyphenol-rich vegetables and the reduction of
   cardiovascular disease prevalence. This fact could be related to the
   anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic and vasodilatory effects of
   polyphenols. Even though these biological effects could be mainly
   attributed to the antioxidant activity of polyphenols, other
   pharmacological mechanisms should also be considered. The latter could
   comprise direct anti-inflammatory effects, modulation of intracellular
   signaling and gene expression, improvement of nitric oxide homeostasis,
   as well as platelet antiaggregation. However, it is noticeable that
   protocols of interventions to evaluate the properties of polyphenols
   have failed to show the same positive results reported from
   observational studies. At present, a controversy exists regarding the
   actual effectiveness of polyphenols in preventing cardiovascular
   diseases. Therefore, an improvement of the available knowledge about
   polyphenol pharmacokinetics, together with a better understanding of the
   mechanisms of action of these compounds, could be of great benefit.
   Thus, a rational support for the development of interventional designs
   could provide reliable evidence on the actual role of polyphenols in CVD
   prevention.}},

Title = {{Scale of Carbon Nanomaterials Affects Neural Outgrowth and Adhesion}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NANOBIOSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{11-18}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Carbon nanomaterials have become increasingly popular microelectrode
   materials for neuroscience applications. Here we study how the scale of
   carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers affect neural viability,
   outgrowth, and adhesion. Carbon nanotubes were deposited on glass
   coverslips via a layer-by-layer method with polyethylenimine (PEI).
   Carbonized nanofibers were fabricated by electrospinning SU-8 and
   pyrolyzing the nanofiber depositions. Additional substrates tested were
   carbonized and SU-8 thin films and SU-8 nanofibers. Surfaces were
   O2-plasma treated, coated with varying concentrations of PEI, seeded
   with E18 rat cortical cells, and examined at 3, 4, and 7 days in vitro
   (DIV). Neural adhesion was examined at 4 DIV utilizing a parallel plate
   flow chamber. At 3 DIV, neural viability was lower on the nanofiber and
   thin film depositions treated with higher PEI concentrations which
   corresponded with significantly higher zeta potentials (surface charge);
   this significance was drastically higher on the nanofibers suggesting
   that the nanostructure may collect more PEI molecules, causing increased
   toxicity. At 7 DIV, significantly higher neurite outgrowth was observed
   on SU-8 nanofiber substrates with nanofibers a significant fraction of a
   neuron's size. No differences were detected for carbonized nanofibers or
   carbon nanotubes. Both carbonized and SU-8 nanofibers had significantly
   higher cellular adhesion post-flow in comparison to controls whereas the
   carbon nanotubes were statistically similar to control substrates. These
   data suggest a neural cell preference for larger-scale nanomaterials
   with specific surface treatments. These characteristics could be taken
   advantage of in the future design and fabrication of neural
   microelectrodes.}},

Title = {{A Context-Driven Worker Selection Framework for Crowd-Sensing}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Worker selection for many crowd-sensing tasks must consider various
   complex contexts to ensure high quality of data. Existing platforms and
   frameworks take only specific contexts into account to demonstrate
   motivating scenarios but do not provide general context models or
   frameworks in support of crowd-sensing at large. This paper proposes a
   novel worker selection framework, named WSelector, to more precisely
   select appropriate workers by taking various contexts into account. To
   achieve this goal, it first provides programming time support to help
   task creator define constraints. Then its runtime system adopts a
   two-phase process to select workers who are not only qualified but also
   more likely to undertake a crowd-sensing task. In the first phase, it
   selects workers who satisfy predefined constraints. In the second phase,
   by leveraging the worker's past participation history, it further
   selects those who are more likely to undertake a crowd-sensing task
   based on a case-based reasoning algorithm. We demonstrate the
   expressiveness of the framework by implementing multiple crowd-sensing
   tasks and evaluate the effectiveness of the case-based reasoning
   algorithm for willingness-based selection by using a
   questionnaire-generated dataset. Results show that our case-based
   reasoning algorithm outperforms the currently practiced baseline method.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon materials such as nanoparticles have provided new solutions for
   the removal of various environmental contaminants. In this work, two
   carbon nanomaterial-biochar nanocomposites (SG-PySA-CNT and SG-PySA-GO)
   were derived from sweetgum biomass pretreated with carbon nanotubes
   (CNTs) and graphene oxide (GO) through slow pyrolysis at 600 degrees C.
   Both SG-PySA-CNT and SG-PySA-GO had higher surface area but much lower
   pore volume than the pristine biochar (SG). Batch sorption experimental
   results showed that SG-PySA-CNT and SG-PySA-GO had greater sorption
   ability to Pb(II) and Cd(II) from aqueous solution than SG. SG-PySA-GO
   was the best sorbent with maximum sorption capacities higher than 40 and
   10 mg g(-1) for Pb(II) and Cd(II), respectively. The enhanced metal
   sorption by the biochar nanocomposites could be mainly attributed to the
   excellent sorptive properties of the carbon nanoparticles (CNT/GO)
   distributed and stabilized on the biochar surfaces within the matrix.
   Because of its facile synthesis and good sorptive properties,
   biochar-supported CNT and GO nanocomposites have great potential to be
   used in various environmental applications for the removal of metal and
   metalloid contaminants.}},

Abstract = {{The extracellular matrix has been shown to profoundly influence both
   cell morphology and numerous cellular processes - including adhesion,
   differentiation, and alignment - through a range of chemical,
   mechanical, and topographical features. In these studies, we investigate
   a versatile platform for functionalizing micro-3D-printed (mu-3DP)
   protein hydrogels via multiphoton excitation of benzophenone-biotin, a
   photoactivatable ligand capable of reacting with the hydrogel matrix,
   which is subsequently linked to a biotinylated cell-adhesive peptide
   through a NeutrAvidin (R) bridge. This functionalization strategy is
   potentially applicable to a broad range of hydrogel platforms, enabling
   biomolecules to be precisely patterned at specified locations within 3D
   materials. As proof-of-concept of this strategy's utility, we
   demonstrate that chemical modifications can be made to m-3DP protein
   hydrogels that enable Schwann cells to be patterned without altering the
   mechanical or topographical properties of the hydrogel to an extent that
   influences SC cell adhesion. The ability to independently control
   potential cellular cues within in vitro cellular microenvironments is
   essential to investigating decoupled effects of biomaterial properties
   on cell-matrix interactions. In addition, we demonstrate feasibility for
   generating arbitrary immobilized chemical gradient profiles, a result
   that opens important opportunities for understanding and controlling
   haptotactic behaviors, such as directed migration, that are key to
   various tissue regeneration applications.}},

Abstract = {{We report the first synthesis of hyperbranched
   poly(N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide) (HB-PHPMA) using reversible
   addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) self-condensing vinyl
   polymerization (SCVP). The synthesis of these complex, well-defined
   architectures involved the copolymerization of HPMA with a chain
   transfer monomer (CTM). The polymerization kinetics, as well as the
   effects of initiator concentration and the ratio of monomer to CTM were
   studied. The resulting polymers show high molecular weights and
   controlled branching frequencies. Due to their inherent amphiphilic
   nature, these hyperbranched structures self-assemble into aggregates in
   water. Additionally, we determined the cloud point of the HB-PHPMA to be
   in the range of sub-ambient temperature to 40 degrees C. This approach
   provides access to a new class of thermoresponsive PHPMA polymers with
   potential to be used in drug delivery and other biological applications.}},

Abstract = {{Lead-free piezoelectric nanowires (NWs) show strong potential in sensing
   and energy harvesting applications due to their flexibility and ability
   to convert mechanical energy to electric energy. Currently, most
   lead-free piezoelectric NWs are produced through low yield synthesis
   methods and result in low electromechanical coupling, which limit their
   efficiency as energy harvesters. In order to alleviate these issues, a
   scalable method is developed to synthesize perovskite type
   0.5Ba(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O-3-0.5(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3 (BZTBCT) NWs with high
   piezoelectric coupling coefficient. The piezoelectric coupling
   coefficient of the BZT-BCT NWs is measured by a refined piezoresponse
   force microscopy (PFM) testing method and shows the highest reported
   coupling coefficient for lead-free piezoelectric nanowires of 90 +/- 5
   pm V-1. Flexible nanocomposites utilizing dispersed BZT-BCT NWs are
   fabricated to demonstrate an energy harvesting application with an open
   circuit voltage of up to 6.25 V and a power density of up to 2.25 mu W
   cm(-3). The high electromechanical coupling coefficient and high power
   density demonstrated with these lead-free NWs produced via a scalable
   synthesis method shows the potential for high performance NW-based

Journal = {{POLYMER CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1971-1978}},
Abstract = {{Two sets of reversible covalent linkages distributed in series along a
   polymer backbone were used to prepare a new class of
   doubly-dynamic-covalent polymers capable of reversibly dissociating via
   two distinct pathways. These self-repairable linear polymers were
   prepared via step-growth Diels-Alder polymerization of an AB monomer
   that contained furfuryl- and maleimido groups linked by an oxime bond.
   Both the oxime and oxanorbornene links lent orthogonally reversible
   character to the polymer backbone. The sequentially distributed oxime
   bonds in the polymer were capable of dynamic oxime exchange in the
   presence of a competitive monofunctional alkoxyamine under acidic
   conditions, while the oxanorbornene linkages were susceptible to
   cleavage via retro-Diels-Alder reactions at elevated temperatures and
   recombination upon cooling. The self-healing or reversible nature of the
   dynamic-covalent oxime bonds and oxanorbornene links has potential for
   designing stimuli-responsive self-repairable materials for sensors and

Abstract = {{Travel time reliability allows agencies to evaluate the performance of a

   travel time reliability estimation for state-wide reporting in Florida.
   To account for Florida-specific conditions, weather impacts focus only
   on rain intensity. The methodology incorporates different rainfall
   characteristics of regions across Florida and calibrates the rainfall
   intensity distribution models on a zip code basis for each hour. The
   probability of clear weather, light rain, and heavy rain is determined

   facilitate the reaction in water by solubilizing the 2-PP organobase and
   the reactants in their active forms. The reactant-SDS interactions in
   micelles play a significant role in promotion of the 2-PP catalyzed
   reaction. The SDS micellar medium not only promotes the 2-PP catalyzed
   reaction but also provides an easy and practicable protocol for the
   separation and reuse of the 2-PP organobase.}},

Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{A1-A27}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a symplectic model reduction technique, proper symplectic
   decomposition (PSD) with symplectic Galerkin projection, is proposed to
   save the computational cost for the simplification of large-scale
   Hamiltonian systems while preserving the symplectic structure. As an
   analogy to the classical proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-Galerkin
   approach, PSD is designed to build a symplectic subspace to fit
   empirical data, while the symplectic Galerkin projection constructs a
   reduced Hamiltonian system on the symplectic subspace. For practical
   use, we introduce three algorithms for PSD, which are based upon the
   cotangent lift, complex singular value decomposition, and nonlinear
   programming. The proposed technique has been proven to preserve system
   energy and stability. Moreover, PSD can be combined with the discrete
   empirical interpolation method to reduce the computational cost for
   nonlinear Hamiltonian systems. Owing to these properties, the proposed
   technique is better suited than the classical POD-Galerkin approach for
   model reduction of Hamiltonian systems, especially when long-time
   integration is required. The stability, accuracy, and efficiency of the
   proposed technique are illustrated through numerical simulations of
   linear and nonlinear wave equations.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a hypothetical case study built upon empirical
   data from Florida to compare socioeconomic impacts of three market-based
   instruments-gasoline tax, mileage fee, and tradable mobility credits or
   permits-in regulating the vehicle miles traveled in Florida. Our
   empirical analysis shows that all three instruments are equally
   effective in achieving the control target, but yield different
   magnitudes of socioeconomic impacts. An increased gasoline tax leads to
   the most adverse changes in consumers' surplus and social welfare. In
   contrast, the changes caused by a tradable credit scheme are smaller.
   Meanwhile, the distributional effects of the gasoline tax and flat
   mileage fee are the most regressive, and a well-designed step-fee
   structure can make the mileage fee policy less regressive. On the other
   hand, a tradable credit scheme is the most equitable in achieving the
   control target while maintaining the current level of revenue. When
   credits are allocated uniformly or in proportion to household size, the
   scheme is mostly progressive. When the credits are allocated with
   respect to existing household travel demands, the impacts are fairly
   uniform among different income groups.}},

Title = {{Increased activity in hydrogen evolution electrocatalysis for partial
   anionic substitution in cobalt oxysulfide nanoparticles}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{2842-2848}},
Abstract = {{The functionality of an electrocatalyst depends sensitively on the
   surface chemistry. In the case of transition-metal compounds, both the
   transition metal cation and the anion must be controlled to maximize the
   electrocatalytic activity. This realization has driven many efforts
   devoted to engineering the cation chemistry, producing many
   state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. Motivated by the critical role the
   cation plays in electrocatalysis, we seek to understand whether a
   similar effect can be achieved with the anion. Herein, we present a
   study on the effect of the anion substitution on the hydrogen evolution
   reaction (HER) electrocatalysis on cobalt oxysulfide nanoparticles. To
   control the sulfur substitution, we use ammonium sulfide to introduce
   sulfur to the cobalt oxide nanoparticles at low temperature without
   inducing secondary phase formation. We find that a lightly doped
   oxysulfide catalyst, which has the composition CoOxS(0.18), exhibits a
   metastable, distorted S-substituted CoO phase and is 2-3 times more
   active for the HER than either end-member of the substitution series.
   Our first-principles calculations attribute the HER enhancement to the
   stronger surface H adsorption which is maximally favorable at a
   relatively low doping level. Our work provides a protocol for
   synthesizing metastable mixed-anion materials and reveals the critical
   role of the anion on the surface physiochemical properties and the HER
   electrocatalysis.}},

Abstract = {{Synthetic materials that can engage the innate and adaptive immune
   systems are receiving increasing interest to confer protection against
   onset of future disease, such as pathogen infection, as well as to treat
   established diseases, such as autoimmunity and cancer. Carbohydrates are
   integral to various immune-related processes, including inflammation,
   adaptive memory, and tolerance, through both their non-covalent
   recognition of carbohydrate-binding proteins and as chemical signatures
   that distinguish self from non-self. Harnessing the biological activity
   of carbohydrates, however, was long hindered by the lack of a `sugar
   code' defining their structure-function relationships, the difficulty of
   carbohydrate synthesis, and the weak binding affinity of monovalent
   carbohydrates for proteins or other biomolecules. The advent of new
   glycan synthesis approaches, combined with increased understanding of
   the role of multivalent carbohydrate clusters in immunology, has spurred
   significant recent growth in the development of multivalent synthetic
   materials modified with carbohydrates (i.e. ``glycomaterials'') to
   activate, temper, or inhibit specific immunological processes. In this
   review, we highlight recent advances in glycomaterials that can inhibit
   T cell apoptosis, establish antigen-specific tolerance, suppress
   inflammation, or inhibit viral entry into host cells via non-covalent
   recognition of carbohydrate-binding proteins. In addition, we survey
   glycomaterials that can act as vaccines for adaptive immunological
   recognition and memory of carbohydrate antigens, with a particular
   emphasis on vaccines against tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens as
   cancer immunotherapies. In total, these examples demonstrate the
   enormous potential of glycomaterials to prevent or treat diverse
   diseases by engaging specific immunological processes.}},

Title = {{A cell-based microarray to investigate combinatorial effects of
   microparticle-encapsulated adjuvants on dendritic cell activation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1672-1685}},
Abstract = {{Experimental vaccine adjuvants are being designed to target specific
   toll-like receptors (TLRs) alone or in combination, expressed by antigen
   presenting cells, notably dendritic cells (DCs). There is a need for
   high-content screening (HCS) platforms to explore how DC activation is
   affected by adjuvant combinations. Presented is a cell-based microarray
   approach, ``immunoarray'', exposing DCs to a large number of adjuvant
   combinations. Microparticles encapsulating TLR ligands are printed onto
   arrays in a range of doses for each ligand, in all possible dose
   combinations. Dendritic cells are then co-localized with physisorbed
   microparticles on the immunoarray, adherent to isolated islands
   surrounded by a non-fouling background, and DC activation is quantified.
   Delivery of individual TLR ligands was capable of eliciting high levels
   of specific DC activation markers. For example, either TLR9 ligand, CpG,
   or TLR3 ligand, poly I:C, was capable of inducing among the highest 10\%
   expression levels of CD86. In contrast, MHC-II expression in response to
   TLR4 agonist MPLA was among the highest, whereas either MPLA or poly
   I:C, was capable of producing among the highest levels of CCR7
   expression, as well as inflammatory cytokine IL-12. However, in order to
   produce robust responses across all activation markers, adjuvant
   combinations were required, and combinations were more represented among
   the high responders. The immunoarray also enables investigation of
   interactions between adjuvants, and each TLR ligand suggested antagonism
   to other ligands, for various markers. Altogether, this work
   demonstrates feasibility of the immunoarray platform to screen
   microparticle-encapsulated adjuvant combinations for the development of
   improved and personalized vaccines.}},

   that the difference in estimated corrosion rates between our system and
   that published by Hultquist et al. are the natural consequence of scale
   and transport differences between the two systems. Thus, the comment
   that the difference in estimated corrosion rates between our system and

   sodium carboxymethylcellulose (SCMC), which is a thickener, was used to
   increase the resistance of water to displacement by injected air in a
   region around the targeted zone. At the same time, an aqueous solution
   of sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS), which is a surfactant, was
   used to reduce the air entry pressure to enhance the air flow through
   the targeted region. Trichloroethene (TCE), dissolved in water, was used
   to represent an aqueous phase volatile organic compound (VOC). A binary
   mixture of perchloroethene (PCE) and n-hexane was also used as a
   nonaqeous phase liquid (NAPL). Controlled air flow through the source
   zone, achieved by emplacing a high viscosity aqueous solution into a
   region surrounding the TCE-impacted zone, resulted in increased TCE
   removal from 23.0\% (control) to 38.2\% during a 2.5 h period. When the
   air flow was focused on the targeted source zone of aqueous phase TCE
   (by decreasing the surface tension within the source zone and its
   vicinity by 28 dyn/cm, no SCMC applied), the mass removal of TCE was
   enhanced to 41.3\% during the same time period. With SCMC and SDBS
   applied simultaneously around and beneath a NAPL source zone,
   respectively, the NAPL components were found to be removed more
   effectively over a period of 82 h than the sparging experiment with no
   additives applied; 84.6\% of PCE and 94.0\% of n-hexane were removed for
   the controlled air flow path experiments (with both SCMC and SDBS
   applied) compared to 52.7\% (PCE) and 74.0\% (n-hexane) removal for the
   control experiment (no additives applied). Based on the experimental
   observations made in this study, applying a viscous aqueous solution
   around the source zone and a surfactant solution in and near the source
   zone, the air flow was focused through the targeted contaminant zone,
   enhancing the removal of VOCs from either an aqueous phase or a NAPL
   phase. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Biochar is a carbon-enriched material that has been investigated for use
   as a remediation agent for environmental contaminants. However, in order
   for biochar to see practical use for metal removal, it has to be
   modified to improve its sorption efficiency. Layered double hydroxides
   (LDHs) are robust sorbents for removal of a wide array of contaminants.
   Thus, two LDH-biochar composites were produced by (1) pyrolysis of
   Ni/Fe-LDH-modified pine feedstock (NFMF), and (2) precipitation of LDHs
   onto pristine biochars (NFMB). Both composites were characterized and
   tested for their ability to remove arsenate {[}As(V)] from aqueous
   solution. X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning
   electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray analyses suggested that
   Ni/Fe-LDH had a layered structure that was anchored on the carbonaceous
   surface in both NFMF and NFMB. The maximum As(V) sorption capacity of
   NFMF and NFMB (1.56 g kg(-1) and 4.38 g kg(-1), respectively) was
   greatly enhanced over that of the unmodified one. The results, such as
   increased sorption at lower solution pH, indicated that electrostatic
   attraction and surface complexation with hydroxyl (-OH) groups were the
   main As(V) sorption mechanisms for both sorbents. The good stability and
   As(V) sorption make Ni/Fe-LDH modified biochars high-potential sorbents
   for environmental remediation.}},

Abstract = {{The Castillo de San Marcos Fort in St. Augustine, FL was built over 330
   years ago and has endured numerous wars between the Spanish and the
   British. During these wars, cannonballs were fired at the fort walls and
   became embedded in the walls. The walls did not shatter, nor did large
   cracks form. The fort was constructed from a native rock called coquina,
   found on the east coast of Florida and the west coast of Australia.
   Coquina is a highly porous sedimentary rock, consisting of crushed
   shells, fossils, limestone, sand, minerals, and clay. There are no
   scientific studies illustrating coquina's ability to withstand
   cannonball impacts. This research focused on testing coquina and a
   similar material (a commercial cellular foam) in uniaxial compression.
   The compression experiments revealed that coquina had two times the
   specific energy compared to a structural foam. The research revealed
   that the microstructure of coquina allows impact to be absorbed by
   progressive failure and hence possesses a high energy absorption
   capability.}},

Title = {{ZnO nanowire interfaces for high strength multifunctional composites
   with embedded energy harvesting}},
Journal = {{ENERGY \& ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{634-643}},
Abstract = {{Continuous power generation from energy harvesting systems is dependent
   on their mechanical strength as they convert wasted mechanical energy
   into useful electrical energy. Here, the first generation of high
   strength, fiber-based energy harvesters is developed through a simple,
   scalable and cost-effective process. To fabricate these light yet robust
   energy harvesting materials, vertically aligned ZnO nanowires are grown
   on the fibers' surface of a woven aramid fabric. The ZnO nanostructured
   interface is used as a functional unit as well as a reinforcement
   component. The power harvesting performance of these hybrid composites
   is demonstrated through direct vibration examination of a fabricated
   cantilever beam. The fabricated hybrid composite energy harvester beam
   produced a high open circuit voltage of similar to 125 mV root mean
   square (and similar to 0.4 V peak-to-peak) when subjected to a cyclic
   base acceleration of only 1g root mean square. Moreover, assessing the
   structural performance of these composites revealed significant increase
   in the elastic modulus and tensile strength of the composites by 34.3\%
   and 18.4\%, respectively. These results indicate that integrating ZnO
   nanowire arrays not only provides energy harvesting capability, but also
   enhances the mechanical properties of the composite. This methodology
   can be considered as the first development of a high strength material
   with embedded energy harvesting and thus demonstrates multifunctional
   materials with improved strength and functionality.}},

   Cavitation}},

Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{97-109}},

Abstract = {{Cavitation-induced shock wave, as might occur in the head during
   exposure to blast waves, was investigated as a possible damage mechanism
   for soft brain tissues. A novel experimental technique was developed to
   visualize and control single bubble cavitation and its collapse, and the
   influence of this process on a nearby tissue surrogate was investigated.
   The experiment utilized a Hopkinson pressure bar system which transmits
   a simulated blast pressure wave (with over-pressure and under-pressure
   components) to a fluid-filled test chamber implanted with a seed gas
   bubble. Growth and collapse of this bubble was recorded during passage
   of the blast wave with a high speed camera. To investigate the potential
   for cavitation damage to a tissue surrogate, local changes in strain
   were measured in hydrogel slices placed in various configurations next
   to the bubble. The strain measurements were made using digital image
   correlation (DIC) technique by monitoring the motion of material points
   on the tissue surrogate. In one configuration, bubble contact dynamics
   resulted in compression contact (> 60 mu s) followed by
   inertially-driven tension (> 140 mu s). In another configuration, the
   influence of local shock waves emanating from collapsed bubbles was
   captured. Large compressive strains (0.25 to 0.5) that were highly
   localized (0.18 mm(2)) were measured over a short time period (< 24 mu
   s) after bubble collapse. High bubble collapse pressures 29 to 125 times
   that of peak blast overpressure are predicted to be the source of these
   large strains. Consistent with theoretical predictions, these
   cavitation-based strains are far larger than the strains imposed by
   passage of the simulated blast wave alone. Finally, the value of this
   experimental platform to investigate the single bubble
   cavitation-induced damage in a biological tissue is illustrated with an
   example test on rat brain slices.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{63}},

Pages = {{43-54}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Goal: We demonstrate an algorithm to automatically learn the
   time-limited waveforms associated with phasic events that repeatedly
   appear throughout an electroencephalogram. Methods: To learn the phasic
   event waveforms we propose a multiscale modeling process that is based
   on existing shift-invariant dictionary learning algorithms. For each
   channel, waveforms at different temporal scales are learned based on the
   assumption that only a few waveforms occur in any window of the
   time-series, but the same waveforms reoccur throughout the signal. Once
   the waveforms are learned, the timing and amplitude of the phasic event
   occurrences are estimated using matching pursuit. To summarize the
   waveforms learned across multiple channels and subjects, we analyze
   their frequency content, their similarity to Gabor-Morlet wavelets, and
   perform shift-invariant k-means to cluster the waveforms. A prototype
   waveform from each cluster is then tested for differential spatial
   patterns between different motor imagery conditions. Results: On
   multiple human EEG datasets, the learned waveforms capture key
   characteristics of signals they were trained to represent, with a
   consistency in waveform morphology and frequency content across multiple
   training sections and initializations. On multichannel datasets, the
   spatial amplitude patterns of the waveforms are also consistent and can
   be used to distinguish different modalities of motor imagery.
   Conclusion: We explored a methodology that can be used for modeling the
   recurrent waveforms in EEG traces. Significance: The methodology
   automatically identifies the most frequent phasic event waveforms in
   EEG, which could then be used as features for automatic evaluation and
   comparison of EEG during sleep, pathology, or mentally engaging tasks.}},

Abstract = {{Images are often considered as functions defined on the image domains,
   and as functions, their (intensity) values are usually considered to be
   invariant under the image domain transforms. This functional viewpoint
   is both influential and prevalent, and it provides the justification for
   comparing images using functional L-p-norms. However, with the advent of
   more advanced sensing technologies and data processing methods, the
   definition and the variety of images has been broadened considerably,
   and the long-cherished functional paradigm for images is becoming
   inadequate and insufficient. In this paper, we introduce the formal
   notion of covariant images and study two types of covariant images that
   are important in medical image analysis, symmetric positive-definite
   tensor fields and Gaussian mixture fields, images whose sample values
   covary i.e., jointly vary with image domain transforms rather than being
   invariant to them. We propose a novel similarity measure between a pair
   of covariant images considered as embedded shapes (manifolds) in the
   ambient space, a Cartesian product of the image and its sample-value
   domains. The similarity measure is based on matching the two embedded
   low-dimensional shapes, and both the extrinsic geometry of the ambient
   space and the intrinsic geometry of the shapes are incorporated in
   computing the similarity measure. Using this similarity as an affinity
   measure in a supervised learning framework, we demonstrate its
   effectiveness on two challenging classification problems: classification
   of brain MR images based on patients' age and (Alzheimer's) disease
   status and seizure detection from high angular resolution diffusion
   magnetic resonance scans of rat brains.}},

Abstract = {{Datacenters, the essential infrastructures for supercomputing and cloud
   computing, are facing increasing pressure of capping tremendous power
   consumption and carbon emission. Many studies have proposed to leverage
   energy storage devices to shave peak power or smooth intermittent power
   for datacenters, respectively. However, a joint energy management of
   peak shaving and renewable energy harvesting in datacenters is still
   lacking. In this paper, we propose a new power management scheme named
   RE-UPS, which explores the opportunity to shave datacenter peak power
   demand with renewable energy. RE-UPS is based on the emerging
   distributed energy storage architecture and existing UPS infrastructure
   of datacenter. It further leverages a dynamic heuristic algorithm to
   determine the appropriate energy storage allocation and server power
   sources. The proposed energy management policies can greatly optimize
   the design among maximizing renewable energy harvest, shaving peak
   power, and maintaining UPS energy availability. Compared to the baseline
   power management schemes, RE-UPS can averagely improve backup energy
   capacity by 28 \%, extend battery lifetime by 42 \%, increase green
   energy utilization by 78 \%, and reduce workload performance degradation
   by 13 \%.}},

Title = {{Neurally Encoding Time for Olfactory Navigation}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Accurately encoding time is one of the fundamental challenges faced by
   the nervous system in mediating behavior. We recently reported that some
   animals have a specialized population of rhythmically active neurons in
   their olfactory organs with the potential to peripherally encode
   temporal information about odor encounters. If these neurons do indeed
   encode the timing of odor arrivals, it should be possible to demonstrate
   that this capacity has some functional significance. Here we show how
   this sensory input can profoundly influence an animal's ability to
   locate the source of odor cues in realistic turbulent environments-a
   common task faced by species that rely on olfactory cues for navigation.
   Using detailed data from a turbulent plume created in the laboratory, we
   reconstruct the spatiotemporal behavior of a real odor field. We use
   recurrence theory to show that information about position relative to
   the source of the odor plume is embedded in the timing between odor
   pulses. Then, using a parameterized computational model, we show how an
   animal can use populations of rhythmically active neurons to capture and
   encode this temporal information in real time, and use it to efficiently
   navigate to an odor source. Our results demonstrate that the capacity to
   accurately encode temporal information about sensory cues may be crucial
   for efficient olfactory navigation. More generally, our results suggest
   a mechanism for extracting and encoding temporal information from the
   sensory environment that could have broad utility for neural information
   processing.}},

Title = {{Symmetry in Sphere-Based Assembly Configuration Spaces}},
Journal = {{SYMMETRY-BASEL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Many remarkably robust, rapid and spontaneous self-assembly phenomena
   occurring in nature can be modeled geometrically, starting from a
   collection of rigid bunches of spheres. This paper highlights the role
   of symmetry in sphere-based assembly processes. Since spheres within
   bunches could be identical and bunches could be identical, as well, the
   underlying symmetry groups could be of large order that grows with the
   number of participating spheres and bunches. Thus, understanding
   symmetries and associated isomorphism classes of microstates that
   correspond to various types of macrostates can significantly increase
   efficiency and accuracy, i.e., reduce the notorious complexity of
   computing entropy and free energy, as well as paths and kinetics, in
   high dimensional configuration spaces. In addition, a precise
   understanding of symmetries is crucial for giving provable guarantees of
   algorithmic accuracy and efficiency, as well as accuracy vs. efficiency
   trade-offs in such computations. In particular, this may aid in
   predicting crucial assembly-driving interactions. This is a primarily
   expository paper that develops a novel, original framework for dealing
   with symmetries in configuration spaces of assembling spheres, with the
   following goals. (1) We give new, formal definitions of various concepts
   relevant to the sphere-based assembly setting that occur in previous
   work and, in turn, formal definitions of their relevant symmetry groups
   leading to the main theorem concerning their symmetries. These
   previously-developed concepts include, for example: (i) assembly
   configuration spaces; (ii) stratification of assembly configuration
   space into configurational regions defined by active constraint graphs;
   (iii) paths through the configurational regions; and (iv) coarse
   assembly pathways. (2) We then demonstrate the new symmetry concepts to
   compute the sizes and numbers of orbits in two example settings
   appearing in previous work. (3) Finally, we give formal statements of a
   variety of open problems and challenges using the new conceptual
   definitions.}},

Abstract = {{Shape memory polymers (SMP) have the potential to be utilized as a
   lightweight, solid state actuator in modern reconfigurable structures
   including as deployment systems for satellite solar panels or morphing
   aircraft wings. This study is predominantly focused on the use of
   Veriflex-S (R), a thermally activated shape memory polymer, and
   bi-directional carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) in a unimorph
   actuator configuration. One of the deficiencies of shape memory polymer
   structures is the lack of recovery after a single or multiple
   thermo-mechanical cycle(s). The novel concept of incorporating
   transverse curvature in the CFRP substrate, similar to that of an
   extendable tape measurer, has demonstrated the ability to improve shape
   recovery by increasing the bending stiffness of the unimorph composite
   actuator to compensate for the lack of recovery of the SMP. Another
   deficiency of SMP actuators is the lack of retention of the stored or
   deformed shape over time. This paper is concerned with the effect of
   transverse curvature on the shape fixity when the unimorph composite is
   mechanically deformed into a stored configuration. A set of experiments
   was designed to determine the influence of transverse curvature, the
   relative widths of SMP and CFRP substrate, and SMP thickness on actuator
   fixity after a thermo-mechanical cycle. The performance of SMP unimorph
   actuators with varying levels of transverse curvature in the substrate
   were evaluated versus SMP unimorph actuators with a flat substrate. The
   ability of the unimorph actuator to minimize shape retention loss was
   evaluated by determining the deflection angle over time after being
   released from the stored configuration. Experimental results indicate
   that in most circumstances transverse curvature does not negatively
   affect the ability of the unimorph actuator to retain its shape fixity.
   Cases of 100 \% or greater retention of shape fixity were documented
   which could lead to the expanded use of transversely curved shape memory
   polymer unimorph actuators in reconfigurable structures.}},

Abstract = {{Home to over half the world's population, cities are the drivers of the
   global economy and the primary influencers of the Earth's
   sustainability. Thus, the burden of sustainable economic development
   falls ever more on cities, with many global organizations and
   governments calling for the promotion of green' economies. Yet how does
   a city move from its current economic structure to a green economy?
   Using detailed occupational data for US cities, we develop a green jobs
   index based on the network of interdependencies between occupational
   specializations. Using this index we quantify how close a city's current
   economy is to the green economy. We further show that movement or
   transition through this occupation space' toward a green economy is a
   slow and difficult process, with the average annual movement towards a
   green economy across all US cities being close to zero. Such difficulty
   is uncorrelated with a city's current population size, density, per
   capita GDP, per capita income, or even the city's current green jobs
   index. Furthermore, the structure of occupational interdependencies
   gives rise to suboptimal movements towards the green economy.}},

Pages = {{28-48}},
Abstract = {{In order to support multi-objective wetland management, this study
   develops a five-step multi-criteria decision framework and uses the Tram
   Chim National Park case to demonstrate decisions by comparing net
   benefits, the framework's outcome, of four wetland zones (A1, A2, A4,
   and A5) of the Park. Methods include (1) identification of key
   management priorities using analytic hierarchy process; (2) assessment
   of use/non-use values using market/non-market valuation techniques.
   Consumptive direct use values were determined by market assessment of
   fishing while a travel cost model was employed to estimate
   non-consumptive direct use values for tourism. Indirect use and non-use
   values were assessed using contingent valuation method. Results showed
   the priorities of tourism, fishing, and management costs. Total fishing
   benefit (fishing income and revenue from permits) was estimated at
   US\$173/year/person. Willingness to pay for preferred plant communities
   varied. For tourism, overall consumer surplus was estimated at
   US\$11/person and tourists would be willing to pay US\$3-5/person more.
   In sum, net benefit for a typical year for zone A1 was highest. The
   framework demonstrates how the decision-making process with regards to
   managing an environmental resource can be enhanced within a
   multi-decision framework using a set of market and non-market economic
   valuation tools.}},

Abstract = {{Interfaces between functional ceramics, such as Pb(Zr0.5Ti0.5)O-3 or
   PZT, and metal electrodes, such as Pt, are important for many devices.
   Maintaining an interface that is free of secondary phases is necessary
   for the efficient transfer of electrons and device function. However,
   there are instances where unstable transient phases form at the
   interface due to atomic diffusion, such as Pt3Pb. Here, we investigate
   the migration barriers for the diffusion of Pb across the PZT/Pt and
   PZT/Pt3Pb interfaces using density functional theory (DFT) and the
   climbing image nudge elastic band (c-NEB) method. Our calculation models
   take into account the influence of atmospheric conditions on Pb
   diffusion through the preferential stabilization of defects near the
   interface as a result of changes to the Pb and O chemical potentials. In
   addition, the PZT structures that are stable above and below the Curie
   temperature are considered. The migration barriers are predicted to be
   strongly dependent on atmospheric conditions and the phase of the PZT,
   tetragonal or cubic. In particular, an inversion of the Pb diffusion
   direction at the PZT/Pt interface is predicted to take place as the
   oxygen partial pressure increases. This prediction is confirmed by
   experimental insitu X-ray diffraction measurements of a PZT/Pt
   interface.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a spherical projectile vertical impact into a granular

   and validated with experiments. We vary the impact velocity (0.9-3.6
   m/s) and size of particles in the bed (1-3 mm) and study the changes in
   ejecta velocity distribution for different impacts. We find good
   agreement for the total ejecta mass and for the velocity distribution of
   the ejecta between simulations and experiments, validating the numerical
   model and method for predicting the outcomes of low-velocity impacts
   into granular media. In addition, we analyzed the influences of granular
   bed size, solid volume fraction and particle density using the DEM and
   present the results of these simulations that could not readily be
   reproduced experimentally. The experimentally validated DEM thus enables
   exploration of parameter spaces that are impractical for experimental

Title = {{Role of Branching on the Rate and Mechanism of C-C Cleavage in Alkanes

Journal = {{ACS CATALYSIS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{The kinetic relevance and rates of elementary steps involved in C-C bond
   hydrogenolysis for isobutane, neopentane, and 2,3-dimethylbutane
   reactants were systematically probed using activation enthalpies and
   free energies derived from density functional theory. Previous studies
   showed that C-C cleavage in alkanes occurs via unsaturated species
   formed in fast quasi-equilibrated C-H activation steps, leading to rates
   that decrease with increasing H-2 pressure, because of a concomitant
   decrease in the concentration of the relevant transition states. This
   study, together with previous findings for n-alkanes, provides a general
   mechanistic construct for the analysis and prediction of C-C
   hydrogenolysis rates on metals. C-C cleavage in alkanes is preceded by
   the loss of two H atoms and the formation of two C-metal (C-M) bonds for
   each C-1 and C-2 atom involved in the C-C bond. Metal atoms transfer
   electrons into the C-1 and C-2 atoms as C-C bonds cleave and additional
   C-M bonds form. C-3 and C-4 atoms of isobutane, neopentane, and
   2,3-dimethylbutane, however, do not lose H atoms before C-C cleavage,
   and thus, transition states cannot bind the C-3 and C-4 atoms in the C-C
   bond being cleaved to surface metal atoms. C-H activation occurs instead
   at C-1 atoms vicinal to the C-C bond, which lose all H atoms and form
   three C-M bonds. These transition states involve electron transfer into
   the metal surface, leading to a net positive charge at the C-3 and C-4
   atoms; these atoms exhibit sp(2) geometry and resemble carbenium ions at
   the C-C cleavage transition state, in which they are not bound to the
   metal surface. These mechanistic features accurately describe measured
   H-2 effects, activation enthalpies, and entropies, and furthermore, they
   provide the molecular details required to understand and predict the
   effects of temperature on hydrogenolysis rates and on the location of
   C-C bond cleavage within a given alkane reagent. The result shown and
   the conclusions reached are supported by rigorous theoretical
   assessments for C-C cleavage within about 200 intermediates on Ir
   surfaces, and the results appear to be applicable to other metals (Rh,
   Ru, and Pt), which show kinetic behavior similar to Ir.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers a class of constrained stochastic composite
   optimization problems whose objective function is given by the summation
   of a differentiable (possibly nonconvex) component, together with a
   certain non-differentiable (but convex) component. In order to solve
   these problems, we propose a randomized stochastic projected gradient
   (RSPG) algorithm, in which proper mini-batch of samples are taken at
   each iteration depending on the total budget of stochastic samples
   allowed. The RSPG algorithm also employs a general distance function to
   allow taking advantage of the geometry of the feasible region.
   Complexity of this algorithm is established in a unified setting, which
   shows nearly optimal complexity of the algorithm for convex stochastic
   programming. A post-optimization phase is also proposed to significantly
   reduce the variance of the solutions returned by the algorithm. In
   addition, based on the RSPG algorithm, a stochastic gradient free
   algorithm, which only uses the stochastic zeroth-order information, has
   been also discussed. Some preliminary numerical results are also
   provided.}},

   approximately solved by means of Nesterov's optimal method. We then
   establish a bound on the total number of Nesterov's optimal iterations,
   i.e., the inner iterations, performed throughout the entire inexact AL
   method to obtain a near primal-dual optimal solution. We also present
   variants with possibly better iteration-complexity bounds than the
   original inexact AL method, which consist of applying the original

Abstract = {{Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is an essential part of most Voice
   over Internet Protocol (VoIP) architecture. Although SIP provides
   attractive features, it is exposed to various security threats, and so
   an efficient and secure authentication scheme is sought to enhance the
   security of SIP. Several attempts have been made to address the tradeoff
   problem between security and efficiency, but designing a successful
   authenticated key agreement protocol for SIP is still a challenging task
   from the viewpoint of both performance and security, because performance
   and security as two critical factors affecting SIP applications always
   seem contradictory. In this study, we employ biometrics to design a
   lightweight privacy preserving authentication protocol for SIP based on
   symmetric encryption, achieving a delicate balance between performance
   and security. In addition, the proposed authentication protocol can
   fully protect the privacy of biometric characteristics and data
   identity, which has not been considered in previous work. The
   completeness of the proposed protocol is demonstrated by Gong, Needham,
   and Yahalom (GNY) logic. Performance analysis shows that our proposed
   protocol increases efficiency significantly in comparison with other
   related protocols.}},

Abstract = {{Due to design and fabrication outsourcing to foundries, the problem of
   malicious modifications to integrated circuits (ICs), also known as
   hardware Trojans (HTs), has attracted attention in academia as well as
   industry. To reduce the risks associated with Trojans, researchers have
   proposed different approaches to detect them. Among these approaches,
   test-time detection approaches have drawn the greatest attention. Many
   test-time approaches assume the existence of a Trojan-free (TF)
   chip/model also known as ``golden model.{''} Prior works suggest using
   reverse engineering (RE) to identify such TF ICs for the golden model.
   However, they did not state how to do this efficiently. In fact, RE is a
   very costly process which consumes lots of time and intensive manual
   effort. It is also very error prone. In this paper, we propose an
   innovative and robust RE scheme to identify the TF ICs. We reformulate
   the Trojan-detection problem as clustering problem. We then adapt a
   widely used machine learning method, K-means clustering, to solve our
   problem. Simulation results using state-of-the-art tools on several
   publicly available circuits show that the proposed approach can detect
   HTs with high accuracy rate. A comparison of this approach with our
   previously proposed approach {[}1] is also conducted. Both the
   limitations and application scenarios of the two methods are discussed
   in detail.}},

Abstract = {{Post-silicon validation is a critical part of integrated circuit design
   methodology. The primary objective is to detect and eliminate the bugs
   that have escaped pre-silicon validation phase. One of the key
   challenges in post-silicon validation is the limited observability of
   internal signals in manufactured chips. A promising direction to improve
   observability is to combine trace and scan signals-a small set of trace
   signals are stored in every cycle, whereas a large set of scan signals
   are dumped across multiple cycles. Existing techniques are not very
   effective, since they explore a coarse-grained combination of trace and
   scan signals. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained architecture that
   addresses this issue using various scan chains with different dumping
   periods. We also propose efficient algorithms to select beneficial
   signals based on this architecture. Our experimental results demonstrate
   that our approach can improve restoration ratio up to 127\% (36\% on
   average) compared with existing trace-only techniques. Our approach also
   shows up to 125\% improvement (61.7\% on average) compared with
   techniques that allow a combination of trace and scan signals with minor
   (<1\%) area and power overhead.}},

Abstract = {{Calcium phosphate-based cements with enhanced regenerative potential are
   promising biomaterials for the healing of bone defects in procedures
   such as percutaneous vertebroplasty. With a view to the use of such

   filling extraction sites. However, the inclusion of certain species into
   bone cement formulations has the potential to diminish the mechanical
   properties of the formulations and thereby reduce their prospects for
   clinical translation. Consequently, we have prepared -tricalcium
   phosphate (-TCP)-based bone cements including materials that we would
   expect to improve their regenerative potential, and describe the
   mechanical properties of the resulting formulations herein. Formulations
   incorporated -TCP, hydroxyapatite, biopolymer-thickened wetting agents,
   sutures, and platelet poor plasma. The mechanical properties of the
   composites were composition dependent, and optimized formulations had
   clinically relevant mechanical properties. Such calcium phosphate-based
   cements have potential as replacements for cements such as those based
   on polymethylmethacrylate. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{327-339}},
Abstract = {{Accumulated UV exposure over long durations could be a contributory
   factor for ocular complications including cataracts and retinal damage.
   UV blocking contact lenses offer excellent protection, however, only a
   few commercial UV blocking contact lenses are available. Thus there is a
   need to develop new approaches for imparting UV blocking to contact
   lenses. We incorporate highly UV absorbing nanoparticles into
   hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA) and silicone hydrogels by polymerizing a
   mixture of monomers and nanoparticles. The nanoparticles are prepared by
   thermal free radical polymerization of an emulsion of hydrophobic UV
   absorbing components that contain a polymerizable vinyl group. The
   particle size is controlled to be less than 100 nm to minimize the
   scattering of visible light. The nanoparticles disperse well in the HEMA
   monomer leading to fully transparent gels with excellent UV blocking.
   The particle suspension does not disperse in the silicone-hydrogel
   formulations necessitating dialysis to reduce the surfactant
   concentration. The silicone-hydrogels loaded with the particles are
   excellent UV blockers but the transparency in the visible range is only
   about 60\%. SEM imaging of the particle loaded gels show that the
   microstructure of the gels depend on the rate of polymerization, with a
   rapid rate leading to a more uniform distribution of the particles. UV
   blocking from the particle loaded gels is not impacted by processing
   such as autoclaving. Also UV exposure does not degrade UV absorption and
   the particles are retained in the lens during storage. Incorporation of
   nanoparticles into contact lenses by the addition of the polymerization
   mixture followed by curing is a promising approach for imparting UV
   protection to contact lenses.}},

Abstract = {{Historical weather data (1900-2000) of the Southeast U.S.A. was divided
   into baseline (neutral, 1981-2000), warm (1935-1954) and cold
   (1958-1977) periods and used in impact simulation experiments to
   understand climate effects on a summer and a winter crop. Simulated
   summer crop (maize) yields were lower in the warm than the cold period,
   but also low during a neutral period. Simulated winter crop (wheat)
   yields were higher during the neutral period than during the warm and
   cold periods. A higher average temperature of a given period did not
   necessarily translate to lower crop yields. Specifically, the summer
   crop (maize) experienced about 7 \% reduction in growing season length
   per degree increase in mean air temperature, and about 5 \% for the
   winter (wheat) crop. Overall, the simulated maize yield was reduced by
   13 \% and wheat yield by 6.5 \% per unit of increase temperature. In
   conclusion, simulated yield reduction per unit increase in mean
   temperature was reduced during the neutral period for the summer while
   for the winter crop there were fewer differences between the warm and

   growing season temperatures while the winter crops was sensitive to
   changes in CO2.}},

Abstract = {{The ultimate goal of cancer surgery is to maximize the excision of
   tumorous tissue with minimal damage to the collateral normal tissues,
   reduce the postoperative recurrence, and improve the survival rate of
   patients. In order to locate tumor lesions, highlight tumor margins,
   visualize residual disease in the surgical wound, and map potential
   lymph node metastasis, various imaging techniques and molecular probes
   have been investigated to assist surgeons to perform more complete tumor
   resection. Combining imaging techniques with molecular probes is
   particularly promising as a new approach for image-guided surgery.
   Considering inherent limitations of different imaging techniques and
   insufficient sensitivity of nonspecific molecular probes, image-guided
   surgery with multimodality strategy and specific molecular probes
   appears to be an optimal choice. In this article, we briefly describe
   typical imaging techniques and molecular probes followed by a focused
   review on the current progress of multimodal image-guided surgery with
   specific molecular navigation. We also discuss optimal strategy that
   covers all stages of image-guided surgery including preoperative
   scanning of tumors, intraoperative inspection of surgical bed and
   postoperative care of patients.}},

Abstract = {{The fast acquisition of heart rate (HR) is a challenge in noncontact
   vital sign detection using a Doppler radar system. Most of the previous
   studies use long-period time windows to guarantee a sufficient frequency
   spectrum resolution for HR measurement using the peak searching method
   on the frequency spectrum. For fast acquisition of HR, the length of the
   time window is less than 5 s and the accuracy is significantly degraded
   due to insufficient spectrum resolution. For vital sign detection using
   complex signal demodulation (CSD), measuring HR variation becomes a
   difficult job due to respiration harmonic interference and insufficient
   frequency spectrum resolution. In this paper, a time-window-variation
   technique is developed for fast acquisition of HR from short-period time
   windows and measuring HR variation using CSD. Experiments are performed
   on four human subjects under controlled laboratory conditions by a
   5.8-GHz continuous-wave Doppler radar vital sign detection system. The
   HR measurement results within 2-5-s time windows are compared by
   applying a simple fast Fourier transform (FFT) and peak searching
   method, a 10-s sliding-time-window FFT method, and the proposed method.
   The proposed method achieves the smallest average error among the three
   techniques. The proposed method has also proved to be able to measure HR
   variation using CSD.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of Infiltration Basin Performance on Coarse Soils}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Infiltration basins are commonly utilized to reduce or eliminate
   stormwater runoff and are commonly located on coarse soils due to
   relatively high infiltration rates. Forty infiltration basins in Florida
   were included in this field study to evaluate whether basin infiltration
   rates varied significantly from their designed infiltration rates.
   Basins were located among Leon, Alachua, and Marion counties in Florida,
   while watershed land uses were equally divided between Florida
   Department of Transportation and residential developments. Generally,
   six test sites within each basin were selected for infiltration rate
   measurement by double-ring infiltrometer (DRI). Also, a soil boring was
   collected from each test site for analyses, including soil texture, bulk
   density, and organic matter content. Infiltration rates were
   log-transformed and statistical analysis was used to determine if DRI
   measurements were significantly different from design rates. Basin soil
   textures were well distributed between sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, and
   sandy clay loam. Most (91\%) bulk densities ranged between 1.30 and 1.80
   g/cm(3) and organic matter percentages ranged from 0.1 to 48.5\%, with
   49\% of soils having less than 3.0\% organic matter. Nearly all bulk
   densities were not limiting to vegetation growth for the respective soil
   texture. Based on DRI rates, 16 (40\%) basins had rates significantly
   less than their designed rates, 10 (25\%) had rates equal to their
   designed rates, and 14 (35\%) basins had rates significantly greater
   than their designed rates. Basins with coarser soils were also more
   likely to have DRI rates greater than designs. In addition, a higher
   proportion of basins located within Florida Department of Transportation
   watersheds had DRI rates greater than or equal to design rates, which
   may be related to vegetation size and diversity. (C) 2015 American

Title = {{Sprinkler Irrigation Pressure and Spacing Effect for Cold Protection of
   Strawberries}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Irrigation for cold protection in strawberries has been used for many
   years to protect plants from cold damage; however, large volumes of
   high-quality water are needed for this purpose. Based on computer
   modeling for citrus, an application rate (AR) of 6.35mmh-1 with impact
   sprinklers providing full coverage has been recommended and successfully
   used for this practice in other crops. Nevertheless, lower rates have
   not been field verified. Thus, the objective for this study was to
   assess the effect of varying irrigation system pressure and sprinkler
   spacing on AR and strawberry yield. The treatments evaluated consisted
   of grower's practices (GROW), representing grower cold protection
   practices using 345-kPa irrigation pressure at 14.6-m sprinkler spacing;
   automated control (AC), with the same setup as GROW but testing an
   automated control system based on real-time dew point; low-pressure
   system (LOW), evaluating irrigation at 207kPa and 14.6-m spacing;
   shorter spacing (SPC), assessing an irrigation system at 345kPa and
   12.2-m spacing; and nonirrigated (NI) or control. A thermostat and
   resistive thermodevices (RTDs) controlled irrigation for GROW, LOW, and
   SPC treatments in 2011-2012 and 2012-2013, respectively, whereas
   wireless temperature and relative humidity (RH) sensors computed dew
   point (DP) and activated the AC irrigation on the basis of plant
   specific thresholds. Significant yield differences between the irrigated
   treatments and NI were observed in both seasons. After a cold event,
   only irrigated treatments showed a comparable linear recovery of yield;
   however, this recovery was not found in the NI treatment. Water savings
   of 5\% and up to 23\% were achieved during the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013
   seasons, respectively, using an automated irrigation system for cold
   protection (AC treatment). No yield differences were obtained when the
   irrigation system pressure was reduced from 345 to 207kPa, but 22\%
   water savings was achieved. Thus, a lower pressure can reduce irrigation
   use without affecting yield in years with mild freezes. (C) 2015

Title = {{Nanoscale toughening mechanism of nacre tablet}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{53}},
Pages = {{200-209}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Nacre has attracted widespread interest because its unique hierarchical
   structure, which is assembled by 95 wt\% brittle aragonite and 5 wt\%
   soft organic materials, leads to several orders of improvement in
   fracture toughness. Apart from the well proposed toughening mechanisms
   such as mineral bridges and tablets interlocks, the organic materials
   including biopolymers between tablets and proteins exist within a tablet
   can also potentially improve the toughness. In this work, we employ a
   novel approach combining steered molecular dynamics (SMD) and classical
   molecular dynamics (MD) to build a model of mineral-protein composite to
   mimic nacre tablet. The critical role of protein in improving the
   fracture toughness of nacre is investigated for the first time. MD
   simulations of single crystalline aragonite, polycrystalline aragonite
   and mineral-protein composite under uniaxial tensile loading are
   performed, and the obtained constitutive responses are compared with
   experimental measurements of nacre under tension. It is shown that the
   fracture toughness of mineral-protein composite is significantly larger
   than that of single crystalline or polycrystalline aragonite. Detailed
   atomic configuration analyses reveal that the fracture of individual
   computer model is governed by its unique failure mechanisms. Dislocation
   motion and phase transformation are observed during the failure of
   single crystalline aragonite. Polycrystalline aragonite fails by the
   intergranular cleavage, as well as phase transformation within grain. It
   is surprisingly noted that other than the stretching of protein chains
   on grain boundaries, intra-granular fracture is triggered in
   mineral-protein composites. Proteins serve as strong glue between the
   inorganic nanograins. It is believed that the strong electrostatic
   interaction between protein and aragonite nanograins, combined with the
   remarkable plastic ductility of protein lead to the intra-granular
   failure, which consequently enhance the fracture toughness of the whole
   specimen. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Parkinson's Disease Biomarkers Program (PDBP) is a multi-site study
   designed to identify Parkinson's disease (PD) biomarkers that can be
   used to improve the understanding of PD pathophysiology and to develop
   tools that provide novel measures to evaluate PD clinical trials. The
   PDBP consortium comprises numerous individual projects of which two are
   specifically geared to the development of brain imaging markers for
   diagnosis, progression, and prognosis of PD or related disorders. All
   study data from PD patients, atypical Parkinsonian patients, patients
   with essential tremor, and healthy controls collected from the sites are
   integrated in the PDBP database and will be publically available. All
   subjects are asked to submit blood samples, and undergo a battery of
   clinical evaluations that cover motor, cognitive, and other background
   information. In addition, a subset of subjects contributed cerebrospinal
   fluid samples. A restricted access, web-based Data Management Resource
   facilitates rapid sharing of data and biosamples across the entire PD
   research community. The PDBP consortium is a useful resource for
   research and collaboration aimed at the discovery of biomarkers and
   their use in understanding the pathophysiology of PD. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Gallium Nitride based high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) are
   attractive for use in high power and high frequency applications, with
   higher breakdown voltages and two dimensional electron gas (2DEG)
   density compared to their GaAs counterparts. Specific applications for
   nitride HEMTs include air, land and satellite based communications and
   phased array radar. Highly efficient GaN-based blue light emitting
   diodes (LEDs) employ AlGaN and InGaN alloys with different compositions
   integrated into heterojunctions and quantum wells. The realization of
   these blue LEDs has led to white light sources, in which a blue LED is
   used to excite a phosphor material; light is then emitted in the yellow
   spectral range, which, combined with the blue light, appears as white.
   Alternatively, multiple LEDs of red, green and blue can be used
   together. Both of these technologies are used in high-efficiency white
   electroluminescent light sources. These light sources are efficient and
   long-lived and are therefore replacing incandescent and fluorescent
   lamps for general lighting purposes. Since lighting represents 20-30\%
   of electrical energy consumption, and because GaN white light LEDs
   require ten times less energy than ordinary light bulbs, the use of
   efficient blue LEDs leads to significant energy savings. GaN-based
   devices are more radiation hard than their Si and GaAs counterparts due
   to the high bond strength in III-nitride materials. The response of GaN
   to radiation damage is a function of radiation type, dose and energy, as
   well as the carrier density, impurity content and dislocation density in
   the GaN. The latter can act as sinks for created defects and parameters
   such as the carrier removal rate due to trapping of carriers into
   radiation-induced defects depends on the crystal growth method used to
   grow the GaN layers. The growth method has a clear effect on radiation
   response beyond the carrier type and radiation source. We review data on
   the radiation resistance of AlGaN/GaN and InAlN/GaN HEMTs and GaN-based
   LEDs to different types of ionizing radiation, and discuss ion stopping
   mechanisms. The primary energy levels introduced by different forms of
   radiation, carrier removal rates and role of existing defects in GaN are
   discussed. The carrier removal rates are a function of initial carrier
   concentration and dose but not of dose rate or hydrogen concentration in
   the nitride material grown by Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition.
   Proton and electron irradiation damage in HEMTs creates positive
   threshold voltage shifts due to a decrease in the two dimensional
   electron gas concentration resulting from electron trapping at defect
   sites, as well as a decrease in carrier mobility and degradation of
   drain current and transconductance. State-of-art simulators now provide
   accurate predictions for the observed changes in radiation-damaged HEMT
   performance. Neutron irradiation creates more extended damage regions
   and at high doses leads to Fermi level pinning while Co-60 gamma-ray
   irradiation leads to much smaller changes in HEMT drain current relative
   to the other forms of radiation. In InGaN/GaN blue LEDs irradiated with
   protons at fluences near 10(14) cm(-2) or electrons at fluences near
   10(16) cm(-2), both current-voltage and light output-current
   characteristics are degraded with increasing proton dose. The optical
   performance of the LEDs is more sensitive to the proton or electron
   irradiation than that of the corresponding electrical performances. (C)

Abstract = {{The compressive mechanical characterization of highly porous ceramics is
   problematic due to sensitivity to stress concentrations and localized
   fractures. In this paper a review of the methods used by the scientific
   community is done and their typical results, advantages, and
   shortcomings are discussed. Here, a new methodology that can address
   some of the problems associated with the current measurement procedures
   is presented. The proposed method is applied to highly porous barium
   titanate foams. This procedure produces more consistent data that can be
   analyzed and interpreted objectively. We show that properties such as
   the crushing or collapse stress as well as the compressive modulus
   cannot be extracted correctly by the conventional methods. By contrast,
   the proposed method collects data that is more accurate, consistent with
   what is expected of porous ceramics and that yields smaller measurement
   to measurement variation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

Title = {{Superheating suppresses structural disorder in layered BiI3

Abstract = {{The susceptibility of layered structures to stacking faults is a problem
   in some of the more attractive semiconductor materials for
   ambient-temperature radiation detectors. In this work, Bridgman-grown
   BiI3 layered single crystals are investigated to understand and
   eliminate structural disorder, which reduces radiation detector
   performance. The use of superheating gradients has been shown by others
   to improve crystal quality in non-layered semiconductor crystals
   (Rudolph et al., 1996) {[}26]; thus the technique was explored to
   improve the growth of BiI3. When investigating the homogeneity of
   non-superheated crystals, highly geometric void defects were found to
   populate the bulk of the crystals. Applying a superheating gradient to
   the melt prior to crystal growth improved structural quality and
   decreased defect density from the order of 4600 voids per cm(3) to 300
   voids per cm(3). Corresponding moderate improvements to electronic
   properties also resulted from the superheat gradient method of crystal
   growth. Comparative measurements through infrared microscopy, etch-pit
   density, X-ray rocking curves, and sheet resistivity readings show that
   superheat gradients in BiI3 growth led to higher quality crystals. (C)

Title = {{Impact of Bias Correction Methods on Estimation of Soil Moisture When

Volume = {{54}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, bias correction approaches are investigated to understand
   their impact on assimilating active and/or passive microwave
   observations on near-surface soil moisture (SM) estimates. Synthetic and
   field observations were assimilated in a soil-vegetation-atmosphere
   transfer model linked with an integrated active-passive model at L-band
   for bare soil. The two bias correction methods included in this study
   are the online bias correction with feedback (BCWF) with extended
   implementation with nonlinear observation operators and the simultaneous
   state parameter (SSP) update. New equations for BCWF were derived for
   the case of nonlinear observation operators because current versions of
   this approach were not applicable for improving SM by assimilating
   microwave observations. In SSP, the bias is compensated by tunning the
   values of the parameters. The two approaches resulted in similar
   accuracy for improving SM estimates compared with the uncorrected
   estimates. SSP showed the highest certainty for both synthetic and field
   observations. Using the bias correction methods, the mean estimates of
   SM improved by up to 88\%, 87\%, and 94\%, when passive, active, and
   active-passive synthetic observations were assimilated, respectively,
   compared with the open-loop estimates. In contrast, when assimilating
   field observations from the Eleventh MicrowaveWater Energy Balance
   Experiment, the mean estimates of SM improved by up to 44\%, 18\%, and
   48\%, when passive, active, and active-passive observations were
   assimilated, respectively, compared with open-loop estimates. The
   decrement in improving the SM estimates suggests sources of uncertainty
   other than those from model parameters and forcings.}},

Abstract = {{Flow boiling heat transfer of water in a thermosyphon loop based natural
   circulation solar steam generation system with a horizontally-arranged
   receiver towards parabolic trough collector (PTC) applications was
   studied experimentally. The diameter ratio (Rd) of the receiver was
   varied over a range from 1.0 to 2.0 to explore its effect on flow
   boiling heat transfer, especially the stratified flow boiling
   characteristics in the receiver tube, and thermal performance of the
   thermosyphon system. The results show that flow boiling heat transfer in
   the receiver was improved since Rd was increased to 1.2 due to a flow
   pattern transition which eliminated the effect of gas liquid
   stratification on surface wettability deterioration in the receiver. An
   optimal tube diameter ratio was found to be 1.4 with a heat transfer
   coefficient enhancement by 12.2\% in comparison to the baseline case.
   Simultaneously, the rise of Rd resulted in an enhancement of backflow in
   the inlet of receiver. The effect of backflow on isothermal improvement
   in the falling tube of thermosyphon, however, was found to be irrelevant
   to the total heat pipe thermal resistance (R-HP). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Removal of tetrachloroethylene from homogeneous and heterogeneous porous
   media: Combined effects of surfactant solubilization and oxidant
   degradation}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{283}},
Pages = {{595-603}},

Abstract = {{High efficiency and cost-effective remediation technologies are needed
   to remove tetrachloroethylene (PCE) from the source zones in soil and
   groundwater systems. This work evaluated the ability of a biodegradable
   surfactant (Tween 80) coupled with an effective oxidant (Fe2+
   (activation agent)-citrate (chelating agent) activated persulfate (PS,
   oxidant)) to remove PCE from porous media. Batch experiments were used
   to optimize the oxidant by testing the effects of PS, citrate, and Fe2+
   concentrations on the PCE degradation. The optimal molar ratio of
   PS/citrate/Fe2+/PCE was 15:15:5:1 for PCE degradation in presence of the
   surfactant. Four sandbox experiments were performed to compare the
   effectiveness of the surfactant and the combination of the surfactant
   with the optimized oxidant in the removal of PCE from homogeneous and
   heterogeneous porous media. PCE saturation distributions in the
   sandboxes were quantified using a light transmission system. In
   addition, the PCE, PS, and Cl- concentrations in the effluents were also
   monitored during the experiments. While the Tween 80 solution removed
   about 52\% and 67\% of PCE from the homogeneous and heterogeneous porous
   media; the combination solution was more effective with removal rates of
   80\% and 84\%, respectively. The enhanced PCE removal was due to the
   combined effects of the surfactant solubilization and PS oxidation: (1)
   Tween 80-enhanced solubilization resulted in an enlarged effective

Abstract = {{Innovative and cost-effective methods are needed to capture and store
   CO2 to reduce anthropogenic impact on global warming. This work produced
   and characterized aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and iron
   oxide-biochar composites, and evaluated their ability to capture CO2 at
   room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Biomass feedstocks were
   treated with metal ions of a variety of concentrations, and were then
   pyrolyzed at 600 degrees C. Characterization experiments showed that the
   process not only turned the biomass into biochar, but also converted the
   metal ions into metal oxyhydroxide nanoparticles onto the carbon
   surfaces with the biochar matrix. As a result, the composites,
   particularly the ones with optimal metal to biomass ratios, had higher
   CO2 capture capacity than the unmodified biochar. All the composites had
   relatively large surface area and captured CO2 mainly through physical
   adsorption. Although Fe2O3-biochar composites had the highest surface
   area, the AlOOH-biochar composite showed the largest sorption. Thus,
   both the characteristics of the metal oxyhydroxides and the surface area
   contributed to the CO2 capture capacity. The maximum adsorption capacity
   (71 mg g(-1) at 25 degrees C) by AlOOH-biochar is comparable to
   commercial adsorbents. The samples had between 90\% and 99\% desorption
   at 120 degrees C, so they required low cost regeneration. All these
   results suggested that biochar-based composites could be a high
   efficiency and cost-effective adsorbent for CO2 capture. (C) 2015

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{111}},
Pages = {{1-6}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this work we present a molecular dynamics study of a symmetrically
   strained SiGe superlattice subjected to compression. We measure the
   velocity of a dislocation nucleated at a step in the superlattice on a
   slip system that cuts across the interfaces, and compare it with that in
   single crystal Si and Ge for the same geometry. Simulation results of
   this work show that the phase interfaces in the short-period SiGe
   superlattice are free of misfit dislocations and that the average
   dislocation velocity in the SiGe superlattice sample is about two orders
   of magnitude lower than that in the Si and Ge single crystals for the
   same geometry and size. The effect of the coherent phase interfaces on
   the average dislocation velocity is quantified, and the underlying
   mechanism is identified. This work demonstrates that the coherency
   stress plays a dominant role on dislocation migration in coherent SiGe
   superlattices. It shows that a phase interface can impede or assist the
   migration of a dislocation depending on whether the sign of the stress
   field along the interface opposes or reinforces that of the dislocation
   core. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of isosurface extraction in uncertain data is an important
   research problem and may be approached in two ways. One can extract
   statistics (e.g., mean) from uncertain data points and visualize the
   extracted field. Alternatively, data uncertainty, characterized by
   probability distributions, can be propagated through the isosurface
   extraction process. We analyze the impact of data uncertainty on
   topology and geometry extraction algorithms. A novel, edge-crossing
   probability based approach is proposed to predict underlying isosurface
   topology for uncertain data. We derive a probabilistic version of the
   midpoint decider that resolves ambiguities that arise in identifying
   topological configurations. Moreover, the probability density function
   characterizing positional uncertainty in isosurfaces is derived
   analytically for a broad class of nonparametric distributions. This
   analytic characterization can be used for efficient closed-form
   computation of the expected value and variation in geometry. Our
   experiments show the computational advantages of our analytic approach
   over Monte-Carlo sampling for characterizing positional uncertainty. We
   also show the advantage of modeling underlying error densities in a
   nonparametric statistical framework as opposed to a parametric
   statistical framework through our experiments on ensemble datasets and
   uncertain scalar fields.}},

Abstract = {{The role of interfacial contamination on antiphase domain boundary (APB)
   formation in GaAs grown epitaxially on Si(100) by metal-organic chemical
   vapor deposition was investigated. The pre-growth cleaning of the Si
   substrate was varied to affect the relative amount of residual surface
   contamination across the wafer. APB density in the as-grown GaAs film
   was examined with the aid of a selective APB etchant. The interfacial
   oxygen and carbon concentrations were determined using secondary ion
   mass spectrometry. It was found that the APB density increased
   significantly from 0.14 to 3.2 mu m(-1) between the center and the edge
   of the wafer. Over this distance, the integrated carbon concentration at
   the GaAs/Si interface increased by an order of magnitude and the
   integrated oxygen concentration, although two orders of magnitude lower
   than carbon, also increased by a factor of six. Analysis of the GaAs/Si
   interface with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and
   high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy
   showed a direct association of APBs with amorphous interfacial
   particles. The particles are likely carbon-based, possibly SiC, and thus
   residual carbon contamination is believed to be the primary contributor
   to increased APB formation.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{539}},

Abstract = {{Black carbon (BC) is a significant component of fine particulate matter
   (PM2.5) air pollution, which has been linked to a series of adverse
   health effects, in particular premature mortality. Recent scientific
   research indicates that BC also plays an important role in climate
   change. Therefore, controlling black carbon emissions provides an
   opportunity for a double dividend. This study quantifies the national
   burden of mortality and morbidity attributable to exposure to ambient BC
   in the United States (US). We use GEOS-Chem, a global 3-D model of
   atmospheric composition to estimate the 2010 annual average BC levels at
   0.5 x 0.667 degrees resolution, and then re-grid to 12-km grid
   resolution across the continental US. Using PM2.5 mortality risk
   coefficient drawn from the American Cancer Society cohort study, the
   numbers of deaths due to BC exposure were estimated for each 12-km grid,
   and then aggregated to the county, state and national level. Given
   evidence that BC particles may pose a greater risk on human health than
   other components of PM2.5, we also conducted sensitivity analysis using
   BC-specific risk coefficients drawn from recent literature. We estimated
   approximately 14,000 deaths to result from the 2010 BC levels, and
   hundreds of thousands of illness cases, ranging from hospitalizations
   and emergency department visits to minor respiratory symptoms.
   Sensitivity analysis indicates that the total BC-related mortality could
   be even significantly larger than the above mortality estimate. Our
   findings indicate that controlling BC emissions would have substantial
   benefits for public health in the US. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Fontanile is a Po Valley (Italy) quasi-natural lowland spring built in
   the middle age. This paper identifies options for the conservation of
   the Fontanile water dependent ecosystem, using scenarios and
   simulations, and exploring different policy options. Three modeling
   analysis have been performed: the first was carried out for estimating
   groundwater contamination and recharge from above, the second for
   evaluating the function of vegetative filter strip on the surface water
   quality and the last one for testing pesticide drift reduction due to
   the vegetative filter strip. Uncertainty characterization included
   climate change projections. Despite the nitrate concentration in water
   could favorite the eutrophication phenomena, this not occurs because of
   the low phosphate concentration in water and of the presence of arboreal
   shade. Therefore, the protection strategies must focus on sustaining
   desirable water quantity conditions. Water saving and conservation
   technologies that improve the agricultural productivity but reduce the
   Fontanile water flow and large buffer strips that have a limited
   efficacy due to the Fontanile hydrological settings can be judged as
   ecological traps. Inefficient irrigation systems, good agricultural
   practices, integrated pest management and arboreal filter strip can
   preserve the quality of those ecosystems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In this work a microchannel array device was used to implement passive
   pumping through the channels to enhance cell-free protein synthesis
   yield by delivering nutrients to the protein synthesis reactions. The
   setup enhanced the sensitivity of ricin detection where the
   implementation of the device caused the positive control with no ricin
   to be 33 times greater than samples with ricin in contrast to
   implementing the reaction in a microcentrifuge tube where the positive
   control had only twice the amount of protein with ricin present.
   Furthermore, the use of the device helped reduce the reagent consumption
   and the cost by a factor of eight and the assay time by a factor of 7
   while allowing for high-throughput studies by enabling running 192
   parallel experiments. Finally, the setup was used to test the presence
   of ricin in beverages where the limit of detection ranged from 2 pM for
   orange juice and 170 pM for diet soda, an interesting observation
   highlighted the importance of testing the effect of the beverage on the
   luminescence signal which could be a direct effect on the enzymatic
   reaction or an indirect one by affecting the protein synthesis reaction
   itself. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{5465-5476}},

Abstract = {{A simple method, modified from White's method, was developed and
   verified for estimating seepage from two stormwater detention areas
   (SDAs) for 2 years, using night-time changes in surface water levels.
   The SDAs were located in warm sub-tropical Florida where the assumption
   of negligible night-time evaporation for White's method does not hold
   true. Daily seepage was estimated using the nocturnal water level
   fluctuations on no flow days during winter when evaporation losses were
   insignificant. Specific yield, rather than the composite specific yield,
   provided accurate seepage estimates. The average annual seepage from the
   two SDAs was 2.03 m/year. At almost 70\% of surface flows, seepage is a
   significant contributor to regional surface and sub-surface flows.
   Comparison of seepage estimates from the night-time method (NM) and the
   water balance (WB) method showed that the NM-based estimates were within
   the range of the estimates from the WB method. At SDA1, the differences
   between the NM and WB estimates were 1\% and 11\%, for the 2 years. The
   discrepancy between the two estimates became higher (27\% and 23\%) at
   SDA2. Larger differences at SDA2 were because of higher error in
   quantifying pumped inflows for the WB method. Successful performance of
   NM combined with its low resource (single well monitoring) requirements
   will help quantify seepage from detention areas and other similar
   features (e.g. ponds, constructed wetlands) in warmer climates. A
   scale-up for the Caloosahatchee River basin showed that seepage from
   SDA's accounted for 15\% of annual river flows indicating the importance
   of seepage in evaluating water and chemical balances. Copyright (C) 2015

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{300}},
Pages = {{830-837}},

Abstract = {{A series of roadway tests strips were paved on-site at a landfill in
   Florida, U.S. Waste to energy (WTE) bottom ash was used as a partial
   course aggregate replacement in a hot mix asphalt (HMA) and a Portland
   cement concrete (PCC) pavement, along with control HMA and PCC sections.
   This allowed for a comparison of the relative degree of leaching between
   both materials (HMA and PCC) as well as between the ash-amended and
   control pavements. Batch and monolithic tank leaching tests were
   conducted on the pavements. Testing of the PCC samples demonstrated that
   Mo and Al were elevated above regulatory thresholds for both the control
   and ash amended samples. Further leach testing demonstrated that the
   release of Mo was likely from the PCC and not a result of the inclusion
   of the BA into pavement. Batch leach testing of ash-amended HMA samples
   revealed Sb as a constituent of potential concern. The results of the
   monolith leaching test displayed leaching of Sb within the same order of
   magnitude as the regulatory threshold. Calculation of the leachability
   index (LI) for Sb found that it would have limited mobility when
   incorporated in the HMA matrix. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The dynamic surface tension of aqueous poly(ethylene
   oxide)-poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide) {[}(PEO-PPO-PEO)]-type
   polymeric surfactant (P103, P105, F108, P123, and F127) solutions were
   correlated with water penetration in packed Teflon powders, the
   sedimentation of Teflon suspensions in these solutions, foamability, and
   contact angle measurements on a Teflon surface. The DST trend with
   bubble lifetime indicated that the overall slowdown in the diffusion
   process in aqueous solutions is a function of a higher poly(ethylene
   oxide) (PEG) molecular weight for a given series of block copolymers
   containing equal PPO molecular weights, favoring slower diffusion
   kinetics to the air water interface caused by preferential partitioning
   in bulk water. The wettability of poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE)
   powder illustrates better water penetration for polymers with low
   molecular weight and lower HLB values. The wettability of F127 solutions
   decreases with corresponding increases in concentration resulting from
   higher viscosity, which restrains the diffusion kinetics at the PTFE
   water interface. The foamability decreases drastically with higher PEG
   molecular weight as attributed by slower diffusion kinetics, leading to
   a decrease in the effective concentration of molecules at the foam
   interface. The contact angle on glass and the PTFE surface are in good
   agreement with assumptions made by other analytical techniques showing a
   lower value of the contact angle with a lower HLB of the Pluronic, which
   relates to the higher adsorption of molecules at the interface. It is
   concluded that the adsorption of molecules at the PTFE water interface
   decreases in aqueous Pluronic solutions with corresponding increases in
   the hydrophilic lipophilic balance (HLB), which is consistent with
   foaming, water penetration in a packed powder of PTFE, the rate of
   sedimentation, and DST data. A PTFE dispersion containing P123 showed
   the maximum wettability and lowest sedimentation among the series of
   block copolymers introduced, which is attributed to faster diffusion
   kinetics and a higher PPO contribution fostering faster adsorption at
   the PTFE surface. The dynamic surface tension of aqueous Pluronic
   solutions seems to correlate well with the adsorption characteristics at
   the air water and PTFE water interfaces.}},

Abstract = {{In the hybrid simulation research, we investigate a new approach to
   build software virtual networks (SVNs) that are indistinguishable from
   their equivalent real live networks (LNs). We define the concept of
   `Network's Interactive Turing Test' based on the similar concept used in
   the artificial intelligence areas. Our goal is to actualize the
   interactive and indistinguishable real-virtual interface pair (RVIP) for
   large-scale computer network simulations. By RVIP's support, a single
   SVN is indistinguishable from its equivalent LN. In the entire hybrid
   system, multiple LNs and multiple SVNs are connected using many RVIPs in
   an arbitrary topology and at real time. To actualize RVIP, the following
   necessary conditions must be satisfied: (i) the performance of the
   underlying simulation platform must be faster than real time; (ii) all
   needed changes incurred by introducing any SVN into an LN scenario are
   put on the simulation's side. To interact with an SVN, RVIP requires
   that no change is made on any live node; (iii) an SVN does not exchange
   simulation events with LNs, that is, only standard IP protocol
   interactions between SVN and LN are allowed. (iv) Any LN can be
   dynamically plugged into the hybrid scenario at real time, just like
   being plugged into an equivalent purely LN. Compared with existing
   hybrid simulation efforts on NS-3, QualNet's EXata and OPNET's
   system-in-the-loop, in this paper, we use the actual RVIP implementation
   to show that RVIP is a better candidate to pass the Network's
   Interactive Turing Test owing to the following two advantages: (i) an
   interactive network tester can easily distinguish the existing hybrid
   networks from the LNs by using a live topology that cannot be simulated,
   for example, by including the entire live Internet. But RVIP is not
   vulnerable to such tests. RVIP can support hybrid scenarios with
   multiple SVNs and multiple LNs connected by an arbitrary network
   topology, and with the LNs on and off at anytime. (ii) Performance-wise,
   our studies show that RVIP provides more efficient support in terms of
   common metrics such as larger throughput limit and smaller extra
   latency; thus, the simulated SVNs are more indistinguishable from their
   live counterparts. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Perhaps one of the most astounding characteristics of the gecko adhesive
   system is its versatility. Geckos can locomote across complex substrates
   in a variety of conditions with apparent ease. In contrast, many of our
   synthetic pressure sensitive adhesives fail on substrates that are
   dirty, wet or rough. Although many studies have investigated the effect
   of environmental challenges on performance, the interaction of multiple,
   potentially compromising variables is studied less often. Here we focus
   on substrate structure and surface water, both of which are highly
   relevant to the biological system and to synthetic design. To do this we
   utilized a highly controlled, patterned substrate (Sharklet (R), by
   Sharklet (R) Technologies Inc.). This allowed us to test independently
   and jointly the effects of reduced surface area substrates, with a
   defined pattern, on adhesion in both air and water. Our results show
   that adhesion is not significantly impaired in air, whereas surface area
   and pattern significantly affect adhesion in water. These findings
   highlight the need to study multiple parameters that are relevant to the
   gecko adhesive system to further improve our understanding of the
   biological system and to design better, more versatile synthetics.}},

Title = {{Cratering of a particle bed by a subsonic turbulent jet: Effect of
   particle shape, size and density}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{138}},
Pages = {{432-445}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{The effect effect of particle properties on scour hole or crater
   formation, which occurs when a localized jet impinges on a bed of
   particles, is explored. Individual particle properties, such as particle
   density, size, and shape, are isolated and a parametric study is
   performed demonstrating the transient and steady crater growth for
   several particles. By keeping the particle diameter constant and
   changing the particle shape, this work shows that the effects of shape
   are significant. Uniform non-spherical (e.g. cylinders) and irregular
   frit shaped (e.g. crushed glass) particles are investigated.
   Non-spherical particles generally have higher friction, and the
   resulting decrease in recirculation rate of particles along the crater
   walls generally produces a narrower but deeper crater relative to
   spheres of the same size. A modification to the densimetric Froude
   number, which scales the steady crater depth to jet and particle
   properties is developed that accounts for particle shape. A new
   description of particle size called the erosion diameter is introduced,
   which is the average of the longest dimension a particle will align in a
   shear flow with its orthogonal, and results in the best scaling. The
   short-term crater depth grows faster for larger particles, which is
   counter to the long-term growth, and is explained by the early behavior
   being dominated by the number of particles that can be eroded. The
   transient crater depth growth is fit by an arctangent fitting function,
   which predicts the steady crater depth, and is compared to the
   logarithmic growth function that is generally used for early crater
   growth. For very large spherical particles, a high velocity is necessary
   for cratering and a newly identified particle-particle based cratering
   mechanism dominates. Additionally, cohesion reduces the crater depth and
   width and the steady crater depth does not scale with non-cohesive
   particles, but a further modification to the densimetric Froude number
   to account for cohesion is proposed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A model for air plasma discharge based on drift-diffusion with local
   mean energy approximation is described. The model consists of 7 species
   and 18 reactions. The code is benchmarked with experimental and

   The code is used to simulate the discharge produced by a wire placed in
   a rectangular channel with grounded electrodes at the top and bottom
   walls. The discharge is concentrated near the wire. The actuator acts on
   the neutral gas through a body force and Joule heating. Around 80\%-90\%
   of the electrical power is converted to Joule heating of the neutral gas
   and the wall. The actuator produces a body force on the order of 0.1
   mN/m. The effectiveness of the actuator increases from 100 to 300 V, and
   plateaus from 300 to 600 V. The results of the study suggest a further
   exploration of the channel concept. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& FLUIDS}},

Abstract = {{We present results from direct numerical simulations (DNS) of
   cylindrical particle-laden gravity currents. We consider the case of a
   full depth release with monodisperse particles at a dilute concentration
   where particle-particle interactions may be neglected. The disperse
   phase is treated as a continuum and a two-fluid formulation is adopted.
   We present results from two simulations at Reynolds numbers of 3450 and
   10,000. Our results are in good agreement with previously reported
   experiments and theoretical models. At early times in the simulations,
   we observe a set of rolled up vortices that advance at varying speeds.
   These Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) vortex tubes are generated at the surface
   and exhibit a counter-clockwise rotation. In addition to the K-H
   vortices, another set of clockwise rotating vortex tubes initiate at the
   bottom surface and play a major role in the near wall dynamics. These
   vortex structures have a strong influence on wall shear-stress and
   deposition pattern. Their relations are explored as well. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{An analytical model of light pulse height distribution for finite
   deuterated scintillation detectors is created using the impulse
   approximation. Particularly, the energy distribution of a scattered
   neutron is calculated based on an existing collision probability scheme
   for general cylindrical shaped detectors considering double differential
   cross-sections. The light pulse height distribution is analytically and
   numerically calculated by convoluting collision sequences with the light
   output function for an EJ-315 detector from our measurements completed
   at Ohio University. The model provides a good description of collision
   histories capturing transferred neutron energy in deuterium-based
   scintillation materials. The resulting light pulse height distribution
   details pulse compositions and their corresponding contributions, It
   shows that probabilities of neutron collision with carbon and deuterium
   nuclei are comparable, however the light pulse amplitude due to
   collisions with carbon nuclei is small and mainly located at the lower
   region of the light pulse distribution axis. The model can explore those
   neutron interaction events that generate pulses near or below a
   threshold that would be imposed in measurements. A comparison is made
   between the light pulse height distributions given by the analytical
   model and measurements It reveals a significant probability of a neutron
   generating a small light pulse due to collisions with carbon nuclei when
   compared to larger light pulse generated by collisions involving
   deuterium nuclei. This model is beneficial to understand responses of
   scintillation materials and pulse compositions, as well as nuclei
   information extraction from recorded pulses. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We examined high-speed video and electric field records of 23 subsequent
   strokes following the previous stroke channel in three natural negative
   lightning flashes, which were obtained at the Lightning Observatory in
   Gainesville (LOG), Florida. Five strokes exhibited faintly luminous
   formations (FLFs) occurring in a single, pre-return-stroke frame and
   ranging from 130 to 908 m in length between the lower end of downward
   leader and the prospective strike point. The FLFs were inferred to be
   not streamers (as in first strokes) but manifestations of an increase in
   conduction current in the defunct channel between the leader and ground
   in response to the increasing electric field produced by the descending
   leader. Further, in eight strokes, we observed residual channel
   luminosity persisting over many frames (for 4.7 to 18 ms), through the
   pre-return-stroke frame. The residual luminosity was apparently
   associated with a stronger channel heating and a larger channel radius
   (and hence a lower temperature decay rate), both associated with the
   relatively long preceding continuing current. Presence of either FLF or
   residual channel luminosity did not appear to significantly influence
   the mode and velocity of propagation of the descending leader.}},

Title = {{Comparing the mechanical properties of the porcine knee meniscus when

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{16}},
Pages = {{4333-4338}},

Abstract = {{As research progresses to find a suitable knee meniscus replacement,
   accurate in vitro testing becomes critical for feasibility and
   comparison studies of mechanical integrity. Within the knee, the
   meniscus is bathed in synovial fluid, yet the most common hydration
   fluid in laboratory testing is phosphate buffered saline (PBS). PBS is a
   relatively simple salt solution, while synovial fluid is a complex
   non-Newtonian fluid with multiple lubricating factors. As such, PBS may
   interact with meniscal tissue differently than synovial fluid, and thus,
   the hydration fluid may be an important factor in obtaining accurate
   results during in vitro testing. To evaluate these effects, medial
   porcine menisci were used to evaluate tissue mechanics in tension (n=11)
   and compression (n=15). In all tests, two samples from the same meniscus
   were taken, where one sample was hydrated in PBS and the other was
   hydrated in synovial fluid. Statistical analysis revealed no significant
   differences between the mean mechanical properties of samples tested in
   PBS compared to synovial fluid; however, compressive testing revealed
   the variability between samples was significantly reduced if samples
   were tested in synovial fluid. For example, the compressive Young's
   Modulus was 12.69 +/- 7.49 MPa in PBS versus 12.34 +/- 4.27 MPa in
   synovial fluid. These results indicate testing meniscal tissue in PBS
   will largely not affect the mean value of the mechanical properties, but
   performing compression testing in synovial fluid may provide more
   consistent results between samples and assist in reducing sample numbers
   in some experiments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A Microperfusion and In-Bore Oxygenator System Designed for Magnetic
   Resonance Microscopy Studies on Living Tissue Explants}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Spectrometers now offer the field strengths necessary to visualize
   mammalian cells but were not designed to accommodate imaging of live
   tissues. As such, spectrometers pose significant challenges-the most
   evident of which are spatial limitations-to conducting experiments in
   living tissue. This limitation becomes problematic upon trying to employ
   commercial perfusion equipment which is bulky and-being designed almost
   exclusively for light microscopy or electrophysiology studies-seldom
   includes MR-compatibility as a design criterion. To overcome problems
   exclusive to ultra-high magnetic field environments with limited spatial
   access, we have designed microperfusion and in-bore oxygenation systems
   capable of interfacing with Bruker's series of micro surface-coils.
   These devices are designed for supporting cellular resolution imaging in
   MR studies of excised, living tissue. The combined system allows for
   precise control of both dissolved gas and pH levels in the perfusate
   thus demonstrating applicability for a wide range of tissue types. Its
   compactness, linear architecture, and MR-compatible material content are
   key design features intended to provide a versatile hardware interface
   compatible with any NMR spectrometer. Such attributes will ensure the
   microperfusion rig's continued utility as it may be used with a
   multitude of contemporary NMR systems in addition to those which are
   currently in development.}},

   oxidative coupling of 4-methylpyridine}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR CATALYSIS A-CHEMICAL}},

Abstract = {{The effects of anatase and rutile titania on PdO/TiO2 catalysts and how
   these phases influence the activity in the oxidative coupling of
   4-methylpyridine to 4,4'-dimethy1-2,2'-bipyridine were investigated. The
   anatase and rutile concentrations were systematically varied by heat
   treating a nearly amorphous nanoparticle titania at temperatures between
   105 and 800 degrees C. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements confirmed
   that the anatase concentration increased with heat treatment temperature
   until rutile began to form at 600 degrees C, and at 800 degrees C rutile
   TiO2 was the only phase observed. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
   analysis of the catalysts revealed strong PdO-TiO2 interactions which
   increased with support treatment temperature. According to XPS, the
   interactions yielded electron-deficient PdO species (Pds{*} with 6 >2)
   and Ti3+ species (likely TiO2 with oxygen vacancies) on the surface of
   the catalysts, as a result of electron transfer from palladium to
   titania. These PdO-TiO2 interactions increased with increasing anatase
   phase in the TiO2 support and the turnover number (TON: number of
   product molecules formed per surface palladium site) followed the same
   trend. The strongest interactions (the largest amounts of Pds{*} with 6
   >2 and Ti3+ species) were observed for the catalysts supported on rutile
   TiO2, which is also the catalyst with the highest TON, revealing the
   importance of electron transfer from palladium to titania in this
   reaction. Despite the high TON for PdO on rutile TiO2, the
   anatase-supported PdO gave a significantly higher product yield due to
   the very low surface area of rutile TiO2. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{A statistical analysis of three ensembles of crop model responses to
   temperature and CO2 concentration}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{214}},
Pages = {{483-493}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Ensembles of process-based crop models are increasingly used to simulate
   crop growth for scenarios of temperature and/or precipitation changes
   corresponding to different projections of atmospheric CO2
   concentrations. This approach generates large datasets with thousands of
   simulated crop yield data. Such datasets potentially provide new
   information but it is difficult to summarize them in a useful way due to
   their structural complexities. An associated issue is that it is not
   straightforward to compare crops and to interpolate the results to
   alternative climate scenarios not initially included in the simulation
   protocols. Here we demonstrate that statistical models based on
   random-coefficient regressions are able to emulate ensembles of
   process-based crop models. An important advantage of the proposed
   statistical models is that they can interpolate between temperature
   levels and between CO2 concentration levels, and can thus be used to
   calculate temperature and {[}CO2] thresholds leading to yield loss or
   yield gain, without rerunning the original complex crop models. Our
   approach is illustrated with three yield datasets simulated by 19 maize
   models, 26 wheat models, and 13 rice models. Several statistical models
   are fitted to these datasets, and are then used to analyze the
   variability of the yield response to {[}CO2] and temperature. Based on
   our results, we show that, for wheat, a {[}CO2] increase is likely to
   outweigh the negative effect of a temperature increase of +2 degrees C
   in the considered sites. Compared to wheat, required levels of {[}CO2]
   increase are much higher for maize, and intermediate for rice. For all
   crops, uncertainties in simulating climate change impacts increase more
   with temperature than with elevated {[}CO2]. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

   (hydride/metal) interfacial growth occurs when n > 0.50, suggested by
   constant interface velocity (U). Diffusional growth at n <0.50 is
   confirmed by the core-shell (Mg-MgH2) structure, drop in U by similar to
   2-orders and the diffusion coefficient (D) of H-atom through hydride.

Title = {{A convenient phase transfer protocol to functionalize gold nanoparticles
   with short alkylamine ligands}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{460}},
Pages = {{164-172}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Hypothesis: Aqueous citrate-stabilized gold nanoparticles (Au NPs)
   cannot be directly transferred from water to an immiscible organic
   solution using short alkyl ligands. However, Au NPs can be transferred
   from water to a water-organic interface if chemical and mechanical
   inputs are used to modify the interfacial energy and interfacial area.
   Ligand exchange can then take place at this interface. After separating
   the particles from the liquids, they can be transferred to a different
   organic phase.
   Experiments: Hexane, alkylamine, and acetone were added to aqueous
   citrate-stabilized Au NPs to form a film at the system interfaces. After
   removing the liquid phases, Au NPs were readily redispersed into
   tetrahydrofuran (THF). The size and shape of the transferred Au NPs were
   evaluated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and small angle
   X-ray scattering (SAXS).
   Findings: Au NPs with 13 nm diameter are readily segregated from water
   with the aid of short alkylamine ligands. They form a thin film at the
   water/organic solvent interface, rendering them easy to separate from
   the liquid phases and possible to redisperse into another organic
   solvent. After the phase transfer process, Au NPs were functionalized
   with short amine ligands. In addition, the shape and size of Au NPs were
   preserved. The short amine-protected Au NPs in THF can stay stable for
   up to 27 days or longer. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Classification of High Dimension Low Sample Size (HDLSS) datasets is a
   challenging task in supervised learning. Such datasets are prevalent in
   various areas including biomedical applications and business analytics.
   In this paper, a new embedded feature selection method for HDLSS
   datasets is introduced by incorporating sparsity in Proximal Support
   Vector Machines (PSVMs). Our method, called Sparse Proximal Support
   Vector Machines (sPSVMs), learns a sparse representation of PSVMs by
   first casting it as an equivalent least squares problem and then
   introducing the l(1)-norm for sparsity. An efficient algorithm based on
   alternating optimization techniques is proposed. sPSVMs remove more than
   98\% of features in many high dimensional datasets without compromising
   on generalization performance. Stability in the feature selection
   process of sPSVMs is also studied and compared with other univariate
   filter techniques. Additionally, sPSVMs offer the advantage of
   interpreting the selected features in the context of the classes by
   inducing class-specific local sparsity instead of global sparsity like
   other embedded methods. sPSVMs appear to be robust with respect to data
   dimensionality. Moreover, sPSVMs are able to perform feature selection
   and classification in one step, eliminating the need for dimensionality
   reduction on the data. To that end, sPSVMs can be used for preprocessing
   free classification tasks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A self-referencing biosensor for real-time monitoring of physiological
   ATP transport in plant systems}},
Journal = {{BIOSENSORS \& BIOELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{37-44}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to develop a self-referencing
   electrochemical biosensor for the direct measurement of ATP flux into
   the extracellular matrix by living cells/organisms. The working
   mechanism of the developed biosensor is based on the activity of
   glycerol kinase and glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase. A stratified bi-enzyme
   nanocomposite was created using a protein-templated silica sal gel
   encapsulation technique on top of graphene-modified platinum electrodes.
   The biosensor exhibited excellent electrochemical performance with a
   sensitivity of 2.4 +/- 1.8 nA/mu M, a response time of 20 +/- 13 s and a
   lower detection limit of 1.3 +/- 0.7 nM. The self-referencing biosensor
   was used to measure exogenous ATP efflux by (i) germinating Ceratopteris
   spores and (ii) growing Zea mays L. roots. This manuscript demonstrates
   the first development of a non-invasive ATP micro-biosensor for the
   direct measurement of eATP transport in living tissues. Before this
   work, assays of eATP have not been able to record the temporally
   transient movement of ATP at physiological levels (nM and sub-nM). The
   method demonstrated here accurately measured {[}eATP] flux in the
   immediate vicinity of plant cells. Although these proof of concept
   experiments focus on plant tissues, the technique developed herein is
   applicable to any living tissue, where nanomolar concentrations of ATP
   play a critical role in signaling and development. This tool will be
   invaluable for conducting hypothesis-driven life science research aimed
   at understanding the role of ATP in the extracellular environment. (C)

Abstract = {{For nearly two decades, the microchannel flow boiling heat transfer
   process has been the subject of numerous studies. A plethora of
   experimental studies have been conducted to decipher the underlying
   physics of the process, and different hypotheses have been presented to
   describe its microscopic details. Despite these efforts, the underlying
   assumptions of the existing hypothesis have remained largely unexamined.
   Here, using data at the microscopic level provided by a unique
   measurement approach, we deconstruct the boiling heat transfer process
   into a set of basic mechanisms and explain their role in the overall
   surface heat transfer. We then show how this knowledge allows to relate
   the bubble growth and flow dynamics to the surface heat flux. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Ferroelectric HfO2 thin films 10nm thick are simultaneously doped with
   Al and Si. The arrangement of the Al and Si dopant layers within the
   HfO2 greatly influences the resulting ferroelectric properties of the

   layers led to a remanent polarization of similar to 20 mu C/cm(2) and a
   coercive field strength of similar to 1.2MV/cm. Post-metallization
   anneal temperatures from 700 degrees C to 900 degrees C were used to
   crystallize the Al and Si doped HfO2 thin films. Grazing incidence x-ray
   diffraction detected differences in peak broadening between the mixed Al
   and Si doped HfO2 thin films, indicating that strain may influence the
   formation of the ferroelectric phase with variations in the dopant
   layering. Endurance characteristics show that the mixed Al and Si doped

Abstract = {{Two-step solar therrnochemical water splitting offers a viable solution
   for employing renewable energy pathways for production of high-purity
   hydrogen, which can be used in fuel cells or for the production of
   liquid fuels. One promising thermochemical cycle uses iron oxide as the
   reactive material to split water in a relatively simple two-step
   process. However, this cycle requires high temperatures, on the order of
   1500 degrees C. Therefore, to increase stability and thermal shock
   resistance, iron oxide was deposited onto high-temperature-stable
   ceramic oxides, such as zirconia (ZrO2) and yttria-stabilized zirconia
   (YSZ). Nanoparticle zirconia samples (n-ZrO2 and n-YSZ) were used in
   this study to increase the interactions between the iron oxide and the
   zirconia, and the resulting materials were compared with an iron oxide
   supported on a commercially available porous zirconia support (p-ZrO2).
   After heat treatment, these FeOx/n-ZrO2 and FeOx/n-YSZ materials were
   surprisingly stable and yielded consistent hydrogen production over
   several cycles. The hydrogen yield per cycle for the FeOx/n-YSZ material
   was consistently higher for all iron loadings compared with the
   FeOx/n-ZrO2 materials, and they both yielded significantly more hydrogen
   compared to the FeOx supported on the commercial ZrO2 support. Compared
   with the FeOx/n-YSZ, the iron loading had a larger effect on the
   hydrogen production over n-ZrO2-supported materials. X-ray diffraction
   (XRD) data indicated that iron was incorporated into the unit cell
   lattice of the n-YSZ supported material, which alleviated some of the
   detrimental iron oxide sintering inherent at the high-temperatures of
   the thermochemical water splitting reaction, and resulted in a more
   consistent and higher hydrogen production compared with the FeOx/n-ZrO2
   material. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Title = {{Discrimination between Alzheimer's Disease and Late Onset Bipolar
   Disorder Using Multivariate Analysis}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Late onset bipolar disorder (LOBD) is often difficult to
   distinguish from degenerative dementias, such as Alzheimer disease (AD),
   due to comorbidities and common cognitive symptoms. Moreover, LOBD
   prevalence in the elder population is not negligible and it is
   increasing. Both pathologies share pathophysiological neuroinflammation
   features. Improvements in differential diagnosis of LOBD and AD will
   help to select the best personalized treatment.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the relative significance
   of clinical observations, neuropsychological tests, and specific blood
   plasma biomarkers (inflammatory and neurotrophic), separately and
   combined, in the differential diagnosis of LOBD versus AD. It was
   carried out evaluating the accuracy achieved by classification-based
   computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems based on these variables.
   Materials: A sample of healthy controls (HC) (n=26), AD patients (n=37),
   and LOBD patients (n=32) was recruited at the Alava University Hospital.
   Clinical observations, neuropsychological tests, and plasma biomarkers
   were measured at recruitment time.
   Methods: We applied multivariate machine learning classification methods
   to discriminate subjects from HC, AD, and LOBD populations in the study.
   We analyzed, for each classification contrast, feature sets combining
   clinical observations, neuropsychological measures, and biological
   markers, including inflammation biomarkers. Furthermore, we analyzed
   reduced feature sets containing variables with significative differences
   determined by a Welch's t-test. Furthermore, a battery of classifier
   architectures were applied, encompassing linear and non-linear Support
   Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), Classification and
   regression trees (CART), and their performance was evaluated in a
   leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation scheme. Post hoc analysis of Gini
   index in CART classifiers provided a measure of each variable
   importance.
   Results: Welch's t-test found one biomarker (Malondialdehyde) with
   significative differences (p < 0.001) in LOBD vs. AD contrast.
   Classification results with the best features are as follows:
   discrimination of HC vs. AD patients reaches accuracy 97.21\% and AUG
   98.17\%. Discrimination of LOBD vs. AD patients reaches accuracy 90.26\%
   and AUG 89.57\%. Discrimination of HC vs LOBD patients achieves accuracy
   95.76\% and AUG 88.46\%.
   Conclusion: It is feasible to build CAD systems for differential
   diagnosis of LOBD and AD on the basis of a reduced set of clinical
   variables. Clinical observations provide the greatest discrimination.
   Neuropsychological tests are improved by the addition of biomarkers, and
   both contribute significantly to improve the overall predictive
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Diminishing returns from increased clock frequencies and
   instruction-level parallelism have forced computer architects to adopt
   architectures that exploit wider parallelism through multiple processor
   cores. While emerging many-core architectures have progressed at a
   remarkable rate, concerns arise regarding the performance and
   productivity of numerous parallel-programming tools for application
   development. Development of parallel applications on many-core
   processors often requires developers to familiarize themselves with
   unique characteristics of a target platform while attempting to maximize
   performance and maintain correctness of their applications. The family
   of partitioned global address space (PGAS) programming models comprises
   the current state of the art in balancing performance and
   programmability. One such PGAS approach is SHMEM, a lightweight,
   shared-memory programming library that has demonstrated high performance
   and productivity potential for parallel-computing systems with
   distributed-memory architectures. In the paper, we present research,
   design, and analysis of a new SHMEM infrastructure specifically crafted
   for low-level PGAS on modern and emerging many-core processors featuring
   dozens of cores and more. Our approach (with a new library known as
   TSHMEM) is investigated and evaluated atop two generations of Tilera
   architectures, which are among the most sophisticated and scalable
   many-core processors to date, and is intended to enable similar
   libraries atop other architectures now emerging. In developing TSHMEM,
   we explore design decisions and their impact on parallel performance for
   the Tilera TILE-Gx and TILEPro many-core architectures, and then
   evaluate the designs and algorithms within TSHMEM through
   microbenchmarking and applications studies with other communication
   libraries. Our results with barrier primitives provided by the Tilera
   libraries show dissimilar performance between the TILE-Gx and TILEPro;
   therefore, TSHMEM's barrier design takes an alternative approach and
   leverages the on-chip mesh network to provide consistent low-latency
   performance. In addition, our experiments with TSHMEM show that naive
   collective algorithms consistently outperformed linear distributed
   collective algorithms when executed in an SMP-centric environment. In
   leveraging these insights for the design of TSHMEM, our approach
   outperforms the OpenSHMEM reference implementation, achieves similar to
   positive performance over OpenMP and OSHMPI atop MPICH, and supports
   similar libraries in delivering high-performance parallel computing to
   emerging many-core systems. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{An isoindigo based pi-conjugated oligomer and polymer that contain
   cyclometalated platinum(II) ``auxochrome{''} units were subjected to
   photophysical characterization, and application of the polymer in bulk
   heterojunction polymer solar cells with PCBM acceptor was examined. The
   objective of the study was to explore the effect of the heavy metal
   centers on the excited state properties, in particular, intersystem
   crossing to a triplet (exciton) state, and further how this would
   influence the performance of the organometallic polymer in solar cells.
   The materials were characterized by electrochemistry, ground state
   absorption, emission, and pico-second-nanosecond transient absorption
   spectroscopy. Electrochemical measurements indicate that the
   cyclometalated units have a significant impact on the HOMO energy level
   of the chromophores, but little effect on the LUMO, which is consistent
   with localization of the LUMO on the isoindigo acceptor unit.
   Picosecond-nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy reveals a
   transient with similar to 100 ns lifetime that is assigned to a triplet
   excited state that is produced by intersystem crossing from a singlet
   state on a time scale of similar to 130 ps. This is the first time that
   a triplet state has been observed for isoindigo pi-conjugated
   chromophores. The performance of the polymer in bulk heterojunction
   solar cells was explored with PCOM as an acceptor. The performance of
   the cells was optimum at a relatively high PCBM loading (1:6,
   polymer:PCBM), but the overall efficiency was relatively low with power
   conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.22\%. Atomic force microscopy of blend
   films reveals that the length scale of the phase separation decreases
   with increasing PCBM content, suggesting a reason for the increase in
   PCE with acceptor loading. Energetic considerations show that the
   triplet state in the polymer is too low in energy to undergo charge
   separation with PCBM. Further, due to the relatively low LUMO energy of
   the polymer, charge transfer from the singlet to PCBM is only weakly
   exothermic, which is believed to be the reason that the photocurrent
   efficiency is relatively low.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of polymer side chains on device performance was investigated
   for PBDT(EtHex)-TPD-(Oct):PC70BM and PBDT (EtHex)-TPD (EtHex) :PC70BM
   BHJ solar cells. Going from a linear side chain on the polymer's
   acceptor moiety to a branched side chain was determined to have a
   negative impact on the overall device efficiency, because of
   significantly reduced short-circuit current (J(sc)) and fill factor (FF)
   values. Sub-bandgap external quantum efficiency (EQE) and transient
   photoluminescence (PL) measurements showed more-efficient carrier
   generation for the polymer with linear side chains, because of a higher
   degree of charge-transfer (CT) state delocalization, leading to
   more-efficient exciton dissociation. Furthermore, the increase in pi-pi
   stacking distance and disorder for the bulkier ethylhexyl side chain
   were shown to result in a lower hole mobility, a higher bimolecular
   recombination, and a higher energetic disorder. The use of linear side
   chains on the polymer's acceptor moiety was shown to promote
   photogeneration, because of more-effective CT states and favorable
   carrier transport resulting in improved solar cell performance.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Studying biological networks is of extreme importance in
   understanding cellular functions. These networks model interactions
   between molecules in each cell. A large volume of research has been done
   to uncover different characteristics of biological networks, such as
   large-scale organization, node centrality and network robustness.
   Nevertheless, the vast majority of research done in this area assume
   that biological networks have deterministic topologies. Biological
   interactions are however probabilistic events that may or may not appear
   at different cells or even in the same cell at different times.
   Results: In this paper, we present novel methods for characterizing
   probabilistic signaling networks. Our methods do this by computing the
   probability that a signal propagates successfully from receptor to
   reporter genes through interactions in the network. We characterize such
   networks with respect to (i) centrality of individual nodes, (ii)
   stability of the entire network, and (iii) important functions served by
   the network. We use these methods to characterize major H. sapiens
   signaling networks including Wnt, ErbB and MAPK.}},

Title = {{Two Monthly Continuous Dynamic Model Based on Nash Bargaining Theory for
   Conflict Resolution in Reservoir System}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{So far many optimization models based on Nash Bargaining Theory
   associated with reservoir operation have been developed. Most of them
   have aimed to provide practical and efficient solutions for water
   allocation in order to alleviate conflicts among water users. These
   models can be discussed from two viewpoints: (i) having a discrete
   nature; and (ii) working on an annual basis. Although discrete dynamic
   game models provide appropriate reservoir operator policies, their
   discretization of variables increases the run time and causes
   dimensionality problems. In this study, two monthly based non-discrete
   optimization models based on the Nash Bargaining Solution are developed
   for a reservoir system. In the first model, based on constrained state
   formulation, the first and second moments (mean and variance) of the
   state variable (water level in the reservoir) is calculated. Using
   moment equations as the constraint, the long-term utility of the
   reservoir manager and water users are optimized. The second model is a
   dynamic approach structured based on continuous state Markov decision
   models. The corresponding solution based on the collocation method is
   structured for a reservoir system. In this model, the reward function is
   defined based on the Nash Bargaining Solution. Indeed, it is used to
   yield equilibrium in every proper sub-game, thereby satisfying the
   Markov perfect equilibrium. Both approaches are applicable for water
   allocation in arid and semi-arid regions. A case study was carried out
   at the Zayandeh-Rud river basin located in central Iran to identify the
   effectiveness of the presented methods. The results are compared with
   the results of an annual form of dynamic game, a classical stochastic
   dynamic programming model (e.g. Bayesian Stochastic Dynamic Programming
   model, BSDP), and a discrete stochastic dynamic game model (PSDNG). By
   comparing the results of alternative methods, it is shown that both
   models are capable of tackling conflict issues in water allocation in
   situations of water scarcity properly. Also, comparing the annual
   dynamic game models, the presented models result in superior results in
   practice. Furthermore, unlike discrete dynamic game models, the
   presented models can significantly reduce the runtime thereby avoiding
   dimensionality problems.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic CO2 presently at 400 ppm is expected to reach 550 ppm in
   2050, an increment expected to affect plant growth and productivity.
   Paired stomatal guard cells (GCs) are the gate-way for water, CO2, and
   pathogen, while mesophyll cells (MCs) represent the bulk cell-type of
   green leaves mainly for photosynthesis. We used the two different cell
   types, i.e., GCs and MCs from canola (Brassica napus) to profile
   metabolomic changes upon increased CO2 through supplementation with
   bicarbonate (HCO3-). Two metabolomics platforms enabled quantification
   of 268 metabolites in a time-course study to reveal short-term
   responses. The HCO3- responsive metabolomes of the cell types differed
   in their responsiveness. The MCs demonstrated increased amino acids,
   phenylpropanoids, redox metabolites, auxins and cytokinins, all of which
   were decreased in GCs in response to HCO3-. In addition, the GCs showed
   differential increases of primary C-metabolites, N-metabolites (e.g.,
   purines and amino acids), and defense-responsive pathways (e.g.,
   alkaloids, phenolics, and flavonoids) as compared to the MCs, indicating
   differential C/N homeostasis in the cell-types. The metabolomics results
   provide insights into plant responses and crop productivity under future
   climatic changes where elevated CO2 conditions are to take center-stage.}},

Abstract = {{Ethnopharmacology relevance: The angiogenesis control at the initiation
   of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that mainly blocks the inflammatory
   cascades expects to attenuate the action of angiogenic mediators,
   synovial angiogenesis, and to partially reverse the erosive bone damage.
   Two typical Chinese herbs, Semen Strychni and Tripterygium wilfordii
   Hook F (TwHF) have been used as a remedy to treat RA since ancient time.
   However, their functioning mechanisms are still unknown. Thus it is
   necessary to exploit their underlying mechanism for the treatment of RA.
   Methods: This study was undertaken to analyze their underlying mechanism
   based on a systems biology platform. Firstly, active components of the
   two herbs were screened out from TcmSP database based on their OB and DL
   values. Then their potential targets were predicted by using Random
   Forest, Support Vector Machine, and validated via docking process.
   Finally, a network of compound-target was constructed.
   Results: In this work, 27 and 33 active compounds were screened out from
   Semen Saychni and TwHF, targeting 28 and 32 potential proteins,
   respectively. The results show that the two herbs modulate the
   angiogenesis mediators through both direct and indirect pathways, and 21
   common targets shared by Semen Strychni and TwHF bear major
   responsibility for treating RA.
   Conclusions: The underlying mechanism of Semen Saychni and TwHF in
   treatment of RA is through multiple targets interaction by their
   blocking of the angiogenesis mediator cascades. This may provide us a
   better understanding of the function of the two herbs for the treatment
   of RA, as well as a clue to unveil their possible treatment effects of
   other systemic diseases, and in this way, hopefully the screening models
   may facilitate the discovery of novel combined drugs. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Monte Carlo point process estimation of electromyographic envelopes from
   motor cortical spikes for brain-machine interfaces}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Representation of movement in the motor cortex (M1) has been
   widely studied in brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). The electromyogram
   (EMG) has greater bandwidth than the conventional kinematic variables
   (such as position, velocity), and is functionally related to the
   discharge of cortical neurons. As the stochastic information of EMG is
   derived from the explicit spike time structure, point process (PP)
   methods will be a good solution for decoding EMG directly from neural
   spike trains. Previous studies usually assume linear or exponential
   tuning curves between neural firing and EMG, which may not be true.
   Approach. In our analysis, we estimate the tuning curves in a
   data-driven way and find both the traditional functional-excitatory and
   functional-inhibitory neurons, which are widely found across a rat's
   motor cortex. To accurately decode EMG envelopes from M1 neural spike
   trains, the Monte Carlo point process (MCPP) method is implemented based
   on such nonlinear tuning properties. Main results. Better reconstruction
   of EMG signals is shown on baseline and extreme high peaks, as our
   method can better preserve the nonlinearity of the neural tuning during
   decoding. The MCPP improves the prediction accuracy (the normalized mean
   squared error) 57\% and 66\% on average compared with the adaptive point
   process filter using linear and exponential tuning curves respectively,
   for all 112 data segments across six rats. Compared to a Wiener filter
   using spike rates with an optimal window size of 50ms, MCPP decoding EMG
   from a point process improves the normalized mean square error (NMSE) by
   59\% on average. Significance. These results suggest that neural tuning
   is constantly changing during task execution and therefore, the use of
   spike timing methodologies and estimation of appropriate tuning curves
   needs to be undertaken for better EMG decoding in motor BMIs.}},

Title = {{The effects of chronic intracortical microstimulation on neural tissue
   and fine motor behavior}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective. One approach to conveying sensory feedback in neuroprostheses
   is to electrically stimulate sensory neurons in the cortex. For this
   approach to be viable, it is critical that intracortical
   microstimulation (ICMS) causes minimal damage to the brain. Here, we
   investigate the effects of chronic ICMS on the neuronal tissue across a
   variety of stimulation regimes in non-human primates. We also examine
   each animal's ability to use their hand-the cortical representation of
   which is targeted by the ICMS-as a further assay of possible neuronal
   damage. Approach. We implanted electrode arrays in the primary
   somatosensory cortex of three Rhesus macaques and delivered ICMS four
   hours per day, five days per week, for six months. Multiple regimes of
   ICMS were delivered to investigate the effects of stimulation parameters
   on the tissue and behavior. Parameters included current amplitude
   (10-100 mu A), pulse train duration (1, 5 s), and duty cycle (1/1, 1/3).
   We then performed a range of histopathological assays on tissue near the
   tips of both stimulated and unstimulated electrodes to assess the
   effects of chronic ICMS on the tissue and their dependence on
   stimulation parameters. Main results. While the implantation and
   residence of the arrays in the cortical tissue did cause significant
   damage, chronic ICMS had no detectable additional effect; furthermore,
   the animals exhibited no impairments in fine motor control.
   Significance. Chronic ICMS may be a viable means to convey sensory
   feedback in neuroprostheses as it does not cause significant damage to
   the stimulated tissue.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{For complex engineering systems, there is an increasing interest in the
   use of structural health monitoring systems to estimate the current
   state of damage (diagnosis) and to predict the behavior of the damage in
   the future (prognosis). For fatigue crack growth, one challenge in
   prognosis is to predict dynamic stress history at the location of
   damage. In this article, a method of predicting fatigue crack growth in
   aircraft panels is proposed under variable amplitude loading. A simple
   analytical-numerical method is proposed to calculate dynamic stress
   history from the usage monitoring data. A variable amplitude fatigue
   analysis is then conducted through the use of a fatigue crack growth
   model with the extended finite element method. Numerical examples show
   that the effect of underload and overload is significant in fatigue
   crack growth. It is also indicated that the crack growth rate and
   direction can significantly change under the multi-axial loading
   environment.}},

Journal = {{AGRICULTURE-BASEL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Ammonia is a major fugitive gas emitted from livestock operations and
   fertilization production. This study tested the potential of various
   biochars in removing gaseous ammonia via adsorption processes. Gaseous
   ammonia adsorption capacities of various biochars made from wood shaving
   and chicken litter with different thermal conditions and activation
   techniques were determined using laboratory adsorption column tests.
   Ammonia adsorption capacities of non-activated biochars ranged from 0.15
   to 5.09mgN/g, which were comparable to that of other commercial
   activated carbon and natural zeolite. There were no significant
   differences in ammonia adsorption capacities of steam activated and
   non-activated biochars even if the surface areas of the steam activated
   biochars were about two orders of magnitude greater than that of
   non-activated biochars. In contrast, phosphoric acid activation greatly
   increased the biochar ammonia adsorption capacity. This suggests that
   the surface area of biochar did not readily control gaseous NH3
   adsorption. Ammonia adsorption capacities were more or less linearly
   increased with acidic oxygen surface groups of non-activated and
   steam-activated biochars. Phosphoric acid bound to the acid activated
   biochars is suspected to contribute to the exceptionally high ammonia
   adsorption capacity. The sorption capacities of virgin and water-washed
   biochar samples were not different, suggesting the potential to
   regenerate spent biochar simply with water instead of energy- and
   capital-intensive steam. The results of this study suggest that
   non-activated biochars can successfully replace commercial activated
   carbon in removing gaseous ammonia and the removal efficiency will
   greatly increase if the biochars are activated with phosphoric acid.}},

Abstract = {{Traffic volume measurement is critical in vehicular networks. Existing
   research on traffic volume measurement mainly focuses on single-point
   traffic statistics. In this paper, we switch our view from single-point
   to multi-point and study the important problem of privacy-preserving
   multi-point traffic volume measurement in vehicular cyber-physical
   systems (VCPSs), which complements the state of the art. While embracing
   automatic traffic data collection, which the VCPS provides through
   vehicle-to-infrastructure communications, we also need to accept the
   accompanying challenges: First, the privacy of all participating
   vehicles should be preserved as an inherent requirement of a VCPS;
   second, the measurement scheme should be efficient enough to fit today's
   large-scale vehicular networks. In this paper, we start from a novel
   scheme that measures traffic volume between two arbitrary points
   (locations) through variable-length bit array masking. Then, we extend
   the idea of variable-length bit array masking to address the more
   challenging problem of three-point traffic measurement and present a
   general framework to measure traffic among three or more locations. We
   also perform extensive simulations to demonstrate the superior
   performance, applicability, and scalability of our schemes.}},

Title = {{Intraoperative joint gaps and mediolateral balance affect postoperative

Journal = {{KNEE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{22}},

Pages = {{527-534}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Adjusting joint gaps and establishing mediolateral (ML) soft
   tissue balance are considered essential interventions for better
   outcomes in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). However, the relationship
   between intraoperative laxity measurements and weightbearing knee
   kinematics has not been well explored. This study aimed to quantify the
   effect of intraoperative joint gaps and ML soft tissue balance on
   postoperative knee kinematics in posterior-stabilized (PS)-TKA.
   Methods: We investigated 44 knees in 34 patients who underwent primary
   PS-TKA by a single surgeon. The central joint gaps and ML tilting angles
   at 0 degrees, 10 degrees, 30 degrees, 60 degrees, 90 degrees, 120
   degrees and 135 degrees flexion were measured during surgery. At a
   minimum of two year follow-up, we analyzed in vivo kinematics of these
   knees and examined the influence of intraoperative measurements on
   postoperative kinematics.
   Results: Gap difference of knee flexion at 135 degrees minus 0 degrees
   was correlated with the total posterior translation of lateral femoral
   condyle (r = 0336, p = 0.042) and femoral external rotation (r = 0.488,
   p = 0.002) during squatting, anteroposterior position of lateral femoral
   condyle (r = - 0.510, p = 0.001) and maximum knee flexion (r = 0.355, p
   = 0.031) in kneeling. Similar correlations were observed between deep
   flexion gap differences with respect to the 90 degrees reference and
   postoperative knee kinematics. Well-balanced knees showed less anterior
   translation of medial femoral condyle in mid- to deep flexion,
   consistent femoral external rotation, and the most neutral valgus/varus
   rotation compared with unbalanced knees.
   Conclusion: These findings indicate the importance of adequate
   intraoperative joint gaps in deep flexion and ML soft tissue balance
   throughout the range of motion. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Computer-aided diagnosis of histopathological images usually requires to
   examine all cells for accurate diagnosis. Traditional computational
   methods may have efficiency issues when performing cell-level analysis.
   In this paper, we propose a robust and scalable solution to enable such

   method is developed to delineate cells accurately using Gaussian-based
   hierarchical voting and repulsive balloon model. A large-scale image
   retrieval approach is also designed to examine and classify each cell of
   a testing image by comparing it with a massive database, e.g.,
   half-million cells extracted from the training dataset. We evaluate this
   proposed framework on a challenging and important clinical use case,
   i.e., differentiation of two types of lung cancers (the adenocarcinoma
   and squamous carcinoma), using thousands of lung microscopic tissue
   images extracted from hundreds of patients. Our method has achieved
   promising accuracy and running time by searching among half-million

Abstract = {{This paper reports a large-range electrothermal bimorph
   microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) mirror with fast thermal response.
   The actuator of the MEMS mirror is made of three segments of Cu/W
   bimorphs for lateral shift cancelation and two segments of multimorph
   beams for obtaining large vertical displacement from the angular motion
   of the bimorphs. The W layer is also used as the embedded heater. The
   silicon underneath the entire actuator is completely removed using a
   unique backside deep-reactive-ion-etching DRIE release process, leading
   to improved thermal response speed and front-side mirror surface
   protection. This MEMS mirror can perform both piston and tip-tilt
   motion. The mirror generates large pure vertical displacement up to 320
   m at only 3 V with a power consumption of 56 mW for each actuator. The
   maximum optical scan angle achieved is +/- 18 degrees at 3 V. The
   measured thermal response time is 15.4 ms and the mechanical resonances

Abstract = {{Controlled drug delivery systems have been extensively investigated for
   cancer therapy in order to obtain better specific targeting and
   therapeutic efficiency. Herein, we developed doxorubicin-loaded magnetic
   PLGA microspheres (DOX-MMS), in which DOX was encapsulated in the core
   and high contents (28.3 wt\%) of gamma-Fe2O3 nanoparticles (IOs) were
   electrostatically assembled on the surface of microsphere to ensure the
   high sensitivity to response of an external alternating current magnetic
   field (ACMF). The IOs in ALGA shell can both induce the heat effect and
   trigger shell permeability enhancement to release drugs when DOX-MMs was
   activated by ACMF. Results show that the cumulative drug release from
   DOX-MMs exposed to ACMF for 30 min (21.6\%) was significantly higher
   (approximately 7 times higher) than that not exposed to ACMF (2.8\%).
   The combination of hyperthermia and enhanced DOX release from DOX-MMS is
   beneficial for in vitro 4T1 breast cancer cell apoptosis as well as
   effective inhibition of tumor growth in 4T1 tumor xenografts. Therefore,
   the DOX-MMS can be optimized as powerful delivery system for efficient
   magnetic responsive drug release and chemo-thermal therapy. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This paper presents an efficient noise coupling scheme in
   time-interleaved delta-sigma modulators (DSMs). The traditional voltage
   domain quantization error extraction is replaced with time domain method
   which is inherently available in the noise-shaped integrating quantizers
   (NSIQs). Thus, no digital-to-analog converter is required for the
   noise-coupling. A modified NSIQ scheme is proposed, which not only
   allows the use of the NSIQ with an even number of time-interleaving, but
   also increases the overall noise transfer function (NTF) order. Along
   with an additional order of NTF in the NSIQ, a higher order NTF can be
   achieved by interleaving and noise-coupling multiple channel NSIQs and
   DSMs. The proposed time-interleaved noise-coupling NSIQ can be used as a
   stand alone analog-to-digital converter, or as a quantizer in
   time-interleaved DSMs. Mathematical analysis and MATLAB simulation
   results are provided to prove the efficiency of the proposed scheme.}},

   0.40 water-cement ratio. Concrete samples were prepared and laboratory
   tests were performed to measure strength, elastic modulus, coefficient
   of thermal expansion and shrinkage properties. The environmental
   responses were measured using strain gages, thermocouples, and linear
   variable differential transformers instrumented in full-scale concrete
   slabs. A 3-D finite element model was developed and calibrated using
   strain data measured from the full-scale tests using the HVS. The

Abstract = {{In this paper, the actuation behavior of a two-axis electrothermal MEMS
   (Microelectromechanical Systems) mirror typically used in miniature
   optical scanning probes and optical switches is investigated. The MEMS
   mirror consists of four thermal bimorph actuators symmetrically located
   at the four sides of a central mirror plate. Experiments show that an
   actuation characteristics difference of as much as 4.0\% exists among
   the four actuators due to process variations, which leads to an average
   angular scan error of 0.03 degrees. A mathematical model between the
   actuator input voltage and the mirror-plate position has been developed
   to predict the actuation behavior of the mirror. It is a four-input,
   four-output model that takes into account the thermal-mechanical
   coupling and the differences among the four actuators; the vertical
   positions of the ends of the four actuators are also monitored. Based on
   this model, an open-loop control method is established to achieve
   accurate angular scanning. This model-based open loop control has been
   experimentally verified and is useful for the accurate control of the
   mirror. With this control method, the precise actuation of the mirror
   solely depends on the model prediction and does not need the real-time
   mirror position monitoring and feedback, greatly simplifying the MEMS
   control system.}},

Abstract = {{Studies in hypertension (HTN) pharmacogenomics seek to identify genetic
   sources of variable antihypertensive drug response. Genetic association
   studies have detected single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that link
   to drug responses; however, to understand mechanisms underlying how
   genetic traits alter drug responses, a biological interface is needed.
   Patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide a
   potential source for studying otherwise inaccessible tissues that may be
   important to antihypertensive drug response. The present study
   established multiple iPSC lines from an HTN pharmacogenomics cohort. We
   demonstrated that established HTN iPSCs can robustly and reproducibly
   differentiate into functional vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), a
   cell type most relevant to vasculature tone control. Moreover, a
   sensitive traction force microscopy assay demonstrated that iPSC-derived
   VSMCs show a quantitative contractile response on physiological stimulus
   of endothelin-1. Furthermore, the inflammatory chemokine tumor necrosis
   factor a induced a typical VSMC response in iPSC-derived VSMCs. These
   studies pave the way for a large research initiative to decode
   biological significance of identified SNPs in hypertension

Abstract = {{The movements of organisms can be thought of as aggregations of motion
   primitives: motion segments containing one or more significant actions.
   Here, we present a means to identify and characterize motion primitives
   from recorded movement data. We address these problems by assuming that
   the motion sequences can be characterized as a series of
   dynamical-system-based pattern generators. By adopting a nonparametric,
   Bayesian formalism for learning and simplifying these pattern
   generators, we arrive at a purely data-driven model to automatically
   identify breakpoints in the movement sequences. We apply this model to
   swimming sequences from two hydromedusa. The first hydromedusa is the
   prolate Sarsia tubulosa, for which we obtain five motion primitives that
   correspond to bell cavity pressurization, jet formation, jetting, cavity
   fluid refill, and coasting. The second hydromedusa is the oblate
   Aequorea victoria, for which we obtain five motion primitives that
   correspond to bell compression, vortex separation, cavity fluid refill,
   vortex formation, and coasting. Our experimental results indicate that
   the breakpoints between primitives are correlated with transitions in
   the bell geometry, vortex formation and shedding, and changes in derived
   dynamical quantities. These dynamics quantities include terms like
   pressure, power, drag, and thrust. Such findings suggest that dynamics
   information is inherently present in the observed motions.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation goals are ideally set after a thorough understanding of
   potential threats; however, predicting future spatial patterns of
   threats, such as disturbance, remains challenging. Here, we develop a
   novel extension of network fortification-interdiction models (NFIM) that
   deals with uncertainty in future spatial patterns of disturbance by
   optimally selecting sites that will best mitigate a worst-case scenario
   for a given magnitude of disturbance. This approach uses information on
   between-patch movement probabilities and patch-specific survival, which
   can be estimated from mark-recapture data, to optimize life expectancy.
   Optimization occurs in three interrelated stages: protection, followed
   by disturbance and then assessment. We applied the modelling approach to
   two mark-recapture data sets: roseate terns Sterna dougallii in the
   north-eastern United States and the Everglade snail kite Rostrhamus
   sociabilis plumbeus in Florida. We contrasted the results to a more
   conventional approach of protecting sites that maximize connectivity (by
   minimizing the distances among protected sites) and a bi-objective model
   that maximizes connectivity and the number of individuals under
   protection. Protecting sites that best mitigate future worst-case
   disturbance scenarios consistently resulted in higher predicted life
   expectancies than protecting patches that minimize dispersal distance.
   Predicted life expectancy was similar between NFIM and the bi-objective
   model for the small roseate tern network, yet the NFIM predicted higher
   life expectancy than any of the scenarios in the bi-objective model in
   the snail kite network.Synthesis and applications. This application of
   interdiction models prescribed a combination of patches for protection
   that results in the least possible decrease in life expectancy. Our

   This application of interdiction models prescribed a combination of
   patches for protection that results in the least possible decrease in
   life expectancy. Our analyses of the snail kite and roseate tern
   networks suggest that managing to protect these prescribed patches by
   the network fortification -interdiction models (i.e. protecting against
   the worst-case disturbance scenario) is more beneficial than managing
   patches that minimize dispersal distance or maximize the number of

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to develop a vision-based terminal
   guidance system for sensorless missiles. Specifically, monocular
   vision-based relative navigation and robust control methods are
   developed for a sensorless missile to intercept a ground target
   maneuvering with unknown time-varying velocity. A mobile wireless sensor
   and actor network is considered wherein a moving airborne monocular
   camera (e.g., attached to an aircraft) provides image measurements of
   the missile (actor) while another moving monocular camera (e.g.,
   attached to a small UAV) tracks a ground target. The challenge is to
   express the unknown time-varying target position in the time-varying
   missile frame using image feedback from cameras moving with unknown
   trajectories. In a novel relative navigation approach, assuming the
   knowledge of a single geometric length on the missile, the time-varying
   target position is obtained by fusing the daisy-chained image
   measurements of the missile and the target into a homography-based
   Euclidean reconstruction method. The three-dimensional interception
   problem is posed in pursuit guidance, proportional navigation, and the
   proposed hybrid guidance framework. Interestingly, it will be shown that
   by appropriately defining the error system a single control structure
   can be maintained across all the above guidance methods. The control
   problem is formulated in terms of target dynamics in a `virtual' camera
   mounted on the missile, which enables design of an adaptive nonlinear
   visual servo controller that compensates for the unknown time-varying
   missile-target relative velocity. Stability and zero-miss distance
   analysis of the proposed controller is presented, and a high-fidelity
   numerical simulation verifies the performance of the guidance laws. (C)

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Laser printing is an orifice-free printing approach and has been
   investigated for the printing of two-dimensional patterns and simple
   three-dimensional (3D) constructs. To demonstrate the potential of laser
   printing as an effective bioprinting technique, both straight and
   Y-shaped tubes have been freeform printed using two different bioinks:
   8\% alginate solution and 2\% alginate-based mouse fibroblast
   suspension. It has been demonstrated that 3D cellular tubes, including
   constructs with bifurcated overhang structures, can be adequately
   fabricated under optimal printing conditions. The post-printing cell
   viabilities immediately after printing as well as after 24 h incubation
   are above 60\% for printed straight and Y-shaped fibroblast tubes.
   During fabrication, overhang and spanning structures can be printed
   using a dual-purpose crosslinking solution, which also functions as a
   support material. The advancement distance of gelation reaction front
   after a cycle time of the receiving platform downward motion should be
   estimated for experimental planning. The optimal downward movement step
   size of receiving platform should be chosen to be equal to the height of
   ungelled portion of a previously printed layer.}},

Abstract = {{To maximize the transmitted power available in active sensing, the
   probing waveform should be of constant modulus. On the other hand, in
   order to adapt to the increasingly crowed radio frequency spectrum and
   prevent mutual interferences, there are also requirements in the
   waveform spectral shape. That is to say, the waveform must fulfill
   constraints in both time and frequency domains. In this work, designing
   these waveforms is formulated as a nonlinear constrained optimization
   problem. By introducing auxiliary variable neurons and Lagrange neurons,
   we solve it using the Lagrange programming neural network. We also
   analyze the local stability conditions of the dynamic neuron model.
   Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm is a competitive
   alternative for waveform design with unit modulus and arbitrary spectral
   shapes.}},

   nitride Chireix outphasing power amplifier (PA). The outphasing PA
   consists of two branches of class-F PAs achieving high efficiency and
   good phase linearity and a transmission- line-based Chireix power
   combiner. An analytical model of outphasing PAs with a Chireix power
   combiner is developed to explain observed distortion due to the
   combiner. The validity and accuracy of the proposed analytical model are
   demonstrated by comparing with simulated and measured results of the
   outphasing PA with 10-MHz long term evolution (LTE) signal. Furthermore,
   measurements with - MHz LTE signals are performed to demonstrate the
   correction of the nonlinearity of the outphasing PA using linearization

Abstract = {{Benefits of multi-operator spectrum sharing in wireless networks heavily
   depend on the traffic misbalance in the networks belonging to different
   operators. In this paper, we study the likelihood that such misbalance
   occurs in networks with high traffic dynamics. An extensive business
   portfolio for heterogeneous networks is presented to analyse the
   benefits due to multi-operator cooperation for spectrum sharing. High
   resolution pricing models are developed to dynamically facilitate price
   adaptation to the system state. By using queuing theory, we quantify the
   operators' gains in cooperative arrangements as opposed to
   non-cooperative independent operation. In addition, Markov model is used
   that can handle wider range of different distributions of traffic
   arrivals and service rates. A tractable analysis and quantitative
   results are provided for those gains as a function of the number of
   cooperating operators. Under the condition that there is a traffic
   underflow in one band, it has been shown that with capacity aggregation
   model, the operator operating in other band can take advantage of
   additional channels with probability close to 1. In capacity
   borrowing/leasing model, this advantage is not unconditional, and there
   is a risk that the operator leasing the spectra will suffer temporary
   packet losses. When cognitive models are used in a network with high
   traffic dynamics, 50-70\% of the spectra may be lost due to channel
   corruptions caused by the return of primary users. The gains of traffic
   offloading from a cellular network to a WLAN are quantified by an
   equivalent increase in opportunistic capacity proportional to the ratio
   of aggregate coverage of cellular networks and WLANs. The results
   provide guidelines for business decision in multi-operator network
   management.}},

Abstract = {{We examined characteristics of negative cloud-to-ground lightning
   flashes using their electric field waveforms acquired at the Lightning
   Observatory in Gainesville (LOG), Florida in the summers of 2013 and
   2014. Flash multiplicity, interstroke interval, flash duration, and
   first to subsequent stroke field peak ratio are determined for 478
   flashes containing 2188 strokes and compared with previous results
   obtained in Florida and in other regions. We found that the average
   number of strokes per flash is 4.6 and the percentage of single-stroke
   flash is 12\%. The geometric means of interstroke interval, flash
   duration, and first to subsequent stroke field peak ratio are 52 ms, 223
   ms, and 2.4, respectively. About one-third (34\%) of multiple-stroke
   flashes have at least one subsequent stroke whose field peak is greater
   than that of the first stroke. The geometric mean of normalized electric
   field peak shows a relatively weak tendency to decrease with increasing
   stroke order. We also found that the detectability of preliminary
   breakdown (PB) pulse train is affected by the signal/noise ratio, type
   of storm, peak current and distance. For 222 PB pulse trains, statistics
   on pulse duration, time interval between PB pulse train and return
   stroke (PB-RS interval), and PB-RS field peak ratio (PB/RS ratio) are
   presented. Very short PB-RS (<= 6 ms) intervals were observed to be
   associated with very high return-stroke peak currents and stepped-leader
   speeds. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ionospheric reflection heights estimated using the zero-to-zero and
   peak-to-peak methods to measure skywave delay relative to the ground
   wave were compared for 108 first and 124 subsequent strokes at distances
   greater than 100 km. For either metric there was a considerable decrease
   in average reflection height for subsequent strokes relative to first
   strokes. We showed that the observed difference cannot be explained by
   the difference in frequency content of first and subsequent
   return-stroke currents. Apparent changes in reflection height (estimated
   using the peak-to-peak method) within individual flashes for 54 daytime
   and 11 nighttime events at distances ranging from 50 km to 330 km were
   compared, and significant differences were found. For daytime
   conditions, the majority of the flashes showed either decrease (57\%) or
   non-monotonic variation (39\%) in reflection height with respect to the
   immediately preceding stroke. With respect to the first stroke, 91\% of
   the flashes showed monotonic decrease in height. For nighttime flashes,
   patterns in reflection height changes with respect to the immediately
   preceding stroke were as follows: 46\% no change, 27\% monotonic
   decrease, and 27\% non-monotonic variation. When changes were measured
   with respect to the first stroke, 54\% of nighttime flashes showed
   monotonic decrease and 46\% no change. Ionospheric reflection height
   tends to increase with return-stroke peak current. The observed daytime
   effects can be explained by (a) the dependence of EMP penetration depth
   on source intensity, which decreases with stroke order, (b) additional
   ionization associated with elves, or (c) combination of (a) and (b)
   above. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A terrestrial gamma-ray flash (TGF) observed at ground level is
   presented. It was recorded at the Lightning Observatory in Gainesville,
   Florida, on June 13, 2014. Ground-based observations of TGFs are very
   rare. To date, only two positively identified ones are found in the
   literature. Our TGF was associated with a single-stroke negative
   cloud-to-ground discharge. It had a duration of 16 mu s and consisted of
   6 pulses, two of which exceeded the upper measurement limit of 5.7 MeV.
   The pulses apparently corresponded to individual photons, which is a
   characteristic feature of TGFs. The TGF began 191 mu s after the
   return-stroke electric field peak. The stepped leader duration was as
   short as 3.9 ms. There was essentially no energetic radiation detected
   during the leader process. The NLDN-reported return-stroke peak current
   was as high as 224 kA. The characteristics and occurrence context of the
   LOG-recorded TGF are compared to those of the two similar events found
   in the literature. In all three cases there was evidence of a channel
   carrying appreciable current to ground at the time of TGF, and the
   associated (preceding or concurrent) cloud-to-ground discharge processes
   were unusually intense. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We developed computational methods and tools to assess organ doses for
   pediatric and adult patients undergoing computed tomography (CT)
   examinations. We used the International Commission on Radiological
   Protection (ICRP) reference pediatric and adult phantoms combined with
   the Monte Carlo simulation of a reference CT scanner to establish
   comprehensive organ dose coefficients (DC), organ absorbed dose per unit
   volumetric CT Dose Index (CTDIvol) (mGy/mGy). We also developed methods
   to estimate organ doses with tube current modulation techniques and size
   specific dose estimates. A graphical user interface was designed to
   obtain user input of patient- and scan-specific parameters, and to
   calculate and display organ doses. A batch calculation routine was also
   integrated into the program to automatically calculate organ doses for a
   large number of patients. We entitled the computer program, National
   Cancer Institute dosimetry system for CT(NCICT). We compared our dose
   coefficients with those from CT-Expo, and evaluated the performance of
   our program using CT patient data. Our pediatric DCs show good
   agreements of organ dose estimation with those from CT-Expo except for
   thyroid. Our results support that the adult phantom in CT-Expo seems to
   represent a pediatric individual between 10 and 15 years rather than an
   adult. The comparison of CTDIvol values between NCICT and dose pages
   from 10 selected CT scans shows good agreements less than 12\% except
   for two cases (up to 20\%). The organ dose comparison between mean and
   modulated mAs shows that mean mAs-based calculation significantly
   overestimates dose (up to 2.4-fold) to the organs in close proximity to
   lungs in chest and chest-abdomen-pelvis scans. Our program provides more
   realistic anatomy based on the ICRP reference phantoms, higher age
   resolution, the most up-to-date bone marrow dosimetry, and several
   convenient features compared to previous tools. The NCICT will be
   available for research purpose in the near future.}},

Title = {{Cellulose-hemicellulose interaction in wood secondary cell-wall}},
Journal = {{MODELLING AND SIMULATION IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The wood cell wall features a tough and relatively rigid fiber
   reinforced composite structure. It acts as a pressure vessel, offering
   protection against mechanical stress. Cellulose microfibrils,
   hemicellulose and amorphous lignin are the three major components of
   wood. The structure of secondary cell wall could be imagined as the same
   as reinforced concrete, in which cellulose microfibrils acts as
   reinforcing steel bar and hemicellulose-lignin matrices act as the
   concrete. Therefore, the interface between cellulose and
   hemicellulose/lignin plays a significant role in determine the
   mechanical behavior of wood secondary cell wall. To this end, we present
   a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study attempting to quantify the
   strength of the interface between cellulose microfibrils and
   hemicellulose. Since hemicellulose binds with adjacent cellulose
   microfibrils in various patterns, the atomistic models of
   hemicellulose-cellulose composites with three typical binding modes,
   i.e. bridge, loop and random binding modes are constructed. The effect
   of the shape of hemicellulose chain on the strength of
   hemicellulose-cellulose composites under shear loadings is investigated.
   The contact area as well as hydrogen bonds between cellulose and
   hemicellulose, together with the covalent bonds in backbone of
   hemicellulose chain are found to be the controlling parameters which
   determine the strength of the interfaces in the composite system. For
   the bridge binding model, the effect of shear loading direction on the
   strength of the cellulose material is also studied. The obtained results
   suggest that the shear strength of wood-inspired engineering composites
   can be optimized through maximizing the formations of the contributing
   hydrogen bonds between cellulose and hemicellulose.}},

Abstract = {{Determination of color values on tomato leaves stressed by the high
   temperature using hyperspectral imaging technique was studied in this
   paper. Hyperspectral images of sixty healthy and sixty unhealthy tomato
   leaves in the wavelengths of 380 similar to 1 023 nm were acquired by
   the hyperspectral imaging system. Simultaneously, three color parameters
   (L{*}, a{*} and b{*}) were measured by a colorimeter. Reflectance of all
   pixels in the region of interest (ROI) was extracted from the corrected
   hyperspectral image. Partial Least Squares (PLS) models were established
   based on different preprocessing methods. Successive Projections
   Algorithm (SPA) was identified to select effective wavelengths. Finally,
   Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) models were built
   to classify different types of samples. The results showed that the
   determination coefficient (R-2) were 0. 818, 0. 109 and 0. 896 in the
   prediction sets of PLS modes; 0. 591, 0. 244 and 0. 673 in the
   prediction sets of SPA-PLS models. The overall classification accuracy
   in the prediction sets of PLS-DA models were over 77. 50\%. It
   demonstrated that it is feasible to measure color values on tomato
   leaves and identify different types of samples using hyperspectral

Title = {{Conductive interpenetrating networks of polypyrrole and polycaprolactone
   encourage electrophysiological development of cardiac cells}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{Conductive and electroactive polymers have the potential to enhance
   engineered cardiac tissue function. In this study, an interpenetrating
   network of the electrically-conductive polymer polypyrrole (PPy) was
   grown within a matrix of flexible polycaprolactone (PCL) and evaluated
   as a platform for directing the formation of functional cardiac cell
   sheets. PCL films were either treated with sodium hydroxide to render
   them more hydrophilic and enhance cell adhesion or rendered
   electroactive with PPy grown via chemical polymerization yielding
   PPy-PCL that had a resistivity of 1.0 +/- 0.4 k Omega cm, which is
   similar to native cardiac tissue. Both PCL and PPy-PCL films supported
   cardiomyocyte attachment; increasing the duration of PCL pre-treatment
   with NaOH resulted in higher numbers of adherent cardiomyocytes per unit
   area, generating cell densities which were more similar to those on
   PPy-PCL films (1568 +/- 126 cells mm(-2), 2880 +/- 439 cells mm(-2),
   3623 +/- 456 cells mm(-2) for PCL with 0, 24, 48 h of NaOH pretreatment,
   respectively; 2434 166 cells mm-2 for PPy-PCL). When cardiomyocytes were
   cultured on the electrically-conductive PPy-PCL, more cells were
   observed to have peripheral localization of the gap junction protein
   connexin-43 (Cx43) as compared to cells on NaOH-treated PCL (60.3 +/-
   4.3\% vs. 46.6 +/- 5.7\%). Cx43 gene expression remained unchanged
   between materials. Importantly, the velocity of calcium wave propagation
   was faster and calcium transient duration was shorter for cardiomyocyte
   monolayers on PPy-PCL (1612 +/- 143 mu m/s, 910 +/- 63 ms) relative to
   cells on PCL (1129 +/- 247 mu m/s, 1130 +/- 20 ms). In summary, PPy-PCL
   has demonstrated suitability as an electrically-conductive substrate for
   culture of cardiomyocytes, yielding enhanced functional properties;
   results encourage further development of conductive substrates for use
   in differentiation of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and cardiac
   tissue engineering applications.
   Statement of Significance
   Current conductive materials for use in cardiac regeneration are limited
   by cytotoxicity or cost in implementation. In this manuscript, we
   demonstrate for the first time the application of a biocompatible,
   conductive polypyrrole-polycaprolactone film as a platform for culturing
   cardiomyocytes for cardiac regeneration. This study shows that the novel
   conductive film is capable of enhancing cell-cell communication through
   the formation of connexin-43, leading to higher velocities for calcium
   wave propagation and reduced calcium transient durations among cultured
   cardiomyocyte monolayers. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that chemical
   modification of polycaprolactone through alkaline-mediated hydrolysis
   increased overall cardiomyocyte adhesion. The results of this study
   provide insight into how cardiomyocytes interact with conductive
   substrates and will inform future research efforts to enhance the
   functional properties of cardiomyocytes, which is critical for their use
   in pharmaceutical testing and cell therapy. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia

Abstract = {{Increasingly, there are calls to audit models used in public policy for
   how accurately they portray the reality facing policy makers. Although
   models cannot be logically verified as accurate representations of
   reality, past work concludes that modelers can reasonably demonstrate
   the degree of correspondence. How to establish real-world correspondence
   remains an open question. This paper outlines a framework of
   pre-modeling data diagnostics to provide evidence of correspondence. The
   scheme-based on Nonlinear Time Series Analysis-provides a rigorous
   benchmark for specification and testing of policy models that reduces
   the likelihood that a misspecified model is discredited by an
   unanticipated crisis.}},

Abstract = {{The scanning probe microscope has revolutionized our ability to image
   and characterize the physical and chemical properties of material with
   atomic resolution. It has evolved as a versatile instrument for
   nanofabrication including atomic deposition, nanolithography,
   nanomachining, atomic manipulation, and assembly. However, in order to
   enable practical nanofabrication with scanning probe tips, it is
   critical to address the issues of throughput, tip wear effects, chemical
   cross contamination, and scalability. In this paper, we address these
   issues by designing, optimizing, fabricating, and testing active
   electromechanical cantilever probes with an integrated microgripper for
   automated modular tip exchange. The cantilevers are designed and
   optimized to be compatible with existing atomic force microscope
   systems. Mechanical performance and optimization are carried out by the
   development of an analytical electrothermomechanical model and
   multiphysics finite-element analysis. The silicon cantilevers are formed
   by microfabrication processes and characterized by scanning electron
   microscopy, laser vibrometry, and in situ optical microscopy
   current-voltage studies. The cantilever grippers are shown to actuate
   with a maximum displacement of 3 mu m for each arm at an applied voltage
   of 4 V 6-mu m total displacement for grasping modular tool-tips.
   Gripping is demonstrated by grasping and releasing of a cylindrical
   microtool (wire). {[}2014-0332]}},

Abstract = {{The pore radius (i.e., capillary radius) and contact angle determine the
   capillary pressure generated in a porous medium. The most common method
   to determine these two parameters is through measurement of the
   capillary pressure generated by a reference liquid (i.e., a liquid with
   near-zero contact angle) and a test liquid. The rate of rise technique,
   commonly used to determine the capillary pressure, results in
   significant uncertainties. In this study, we utilize a recently
   developed technique for independently measuring the capillary pressure
   and permeability to determine the equivalent minimum capillary radii and
   contact angle of water within micropillar wick structures. In this
   method, the experimentally measured dryout threshold of a wick structure
   at different wicking lengths is fit to Darcys law to extract the maximum
   capillary pressure generated by the test liquid. The equivalent minimum
   capillary radii of different wick geometries are determined by measuring
   the maximum capillary pressures generated using n-hexane as the working
   fluid. It is found that the equivalent minimum capillary radius is
   dependent on the diameter of pillars and the spacing between pillars.
   The equivalent capillary radii of micropillar wicks determined using the
   new method are found to be up to 7 times greater than the current
   geometry-based first-order estimates. The contact angle subtended by
   water at the walls of the micropillars is determined by measuring the
   capillary pressure generated by water within the arrays and the measured
   capillary radii for the different geometries. This mean contact angle of
   water is determined to be 54.7}},

Title = {{Strain rate sensitive steel constitutive models for finite element
   analysis of vessel-structure impacts}},
Journal = {{MARINE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{171-202}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Civil infrastructure systems such as bridge piers, navigational guide
   walls, and protection structures that are located near navigable
   waterways are inherently at risk for being impacted by cargo vessels
   such as barges and ships. To safely design such systems to possess
   adequate vessel impact resistance, structural loads associated with
   potential vessel-structure collision conditions must be quantified in a
   conservative manner. While high-resolution finite element impact
   simulations may be employed to compute such loads, care must be
   exercised in defining the material characteristics of the vessel if
   conservative structural design loads are to be obtained. Importantly,
   constitutive relationships assigned to steel components in the vessel
   model must be capable of accounting for strain rate sensitivities and
   large-scale plastic deformations.
   In the present study, strain rate sensitive constitutive models were
   developed for two types of steel commonly utilized in marine
   construction in the United States-ASTM A36 and ASTM A1011. Tension tests
   were conducted over a wide range of strain rates (7.00 x 10(-5) s(-1) -
   250 s(-1)) spanning from quasi-static to intermediate and high rates
   that are typically associated with vessel-structure impact events. A
   novel testing apparatus employing an impact pendulum as an energy supply
   mechanism was designed for this study to conduct intermediate to
   high-rate material testing. Features of the apparatus, discussed in this
   paper, overcome key problems encountered in other studies that have
   employed impact loading for tensile material testing. From the testing
   program, representative stress-strain relations and Cowper-Symonds
   strain rate sensitivity parameters were developed for the materials
   tested. Rate sensitivities of the two steel grades tested were found to
   be very similar to each other. Additionally, rate sensitivities from the
   present study agreed well with ultimate stress data measured in past
   studies of mild steel, but were found to be less rate-sensitive than
   yield stress data measured in past studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In an effort to increase the thermal conductivity of UO2 fuel pellets,
   high density UO2-5 vol\% diamond composite pellets were fabricated using

   the sintered pellets were investigated. The pellets with 3 mu m diamond
   particles had a uniform distribution of particles as well as better
   thermal and mechanical properties compared to others. An increase in
   thermal conductivity of up to 41.6\%, 38.3\% and 34.2\% at 100 degrees

Title = {{Scalable analysis of Big pathology image data cohorts using efficient
   methods and high-performance computing strategies}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: We describe a suite of tools and methods that form a core
   set of capabilities for researchers and clinical investigators to
   evaluate multiple analytical pipelines and quantify sensitivity and
   variability of the results while conducting large-scale studies in
   investigative pathology and oncology. The overarching objective of the
   current investigation is to address the challenges of large data sizes
   and high computational demands.
   Results: The proposed tools and methods take advantage of
   state-of-the-art parallel machines and efficient content-based image
   searching strategies. The content based image retrieval (CBIR)
   algorithms can quickly detect and retrieve image patches similar to a
   query patch using a hierarchical analysis approach. The analysis
   component based on high performance computing can carry out consensus
   clustering on 500,000 data points using a large shared memory system.
   Conclusions: Our work demonstrates efficient CBIR algorithms and high
   performance computing can be leveraged for efficient analysis of large
   microscopy images to meet the challenges of clinically salient
   applications in pathology. These technologies enable researchers and
   clinical investigators to make more effective use of the rich
   informational content contained within digitized microscopy specimens.}},

Title = {{Algae scrubbers for phosphorus removal in impaired waters}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{144-158}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Algae scrubbers are a developing technology used for nutrient removal
   from many different impaired waters, including: agricultural runoff,
   wastewater, and animal operation waste. Algae thrive in environments
   with high flow velocities, allowing treatment of large volumes of
   nutrient-rich water. This adaptation helps overcome space issues
   associated with other biological treatment systems. Although algae
   scrubbers have shown promise for recovering phosphorus (P), no detailed
   studies have been completed to research conditions for maximum total P
   (TP) removal. Previous studies have suggested that faster flow rates and
   pulsed inflow conditions are necessary for high biomass production.
   Studies have also theorized that the calcium-phosphorus (Ca-P)
   co-precipitation is the driving TP removal mechanism. As a result, the
   goal of this study was to determine the effect of the following
   operating parameters on TP removal: (1) flow rate, (2) pulsed versus
   constant inflow, (3) calcium addition to inflow water, (4) calcium seed
   addition, and (5) 24-h versus 12-h operation. Results show that 12-h
   operation significantly increases TP removal in algae scrubber systems
   from an average of 24 g/m(2)/y to 52 g/m(2)/y. The high TP removal rate
   can be attributed to the stabilization of Ca-P minerals during 12-h
   operation. Algal photosynthesis increases daytime pH values (9-9.5)
   driving Ca-P co-precipitation, and 12-h operation prevents these
   minerals from re-dissolving at night as the pH decreases back to neutral
   (7-7.5). The maintenance of an algal seed on the scrubbers significantly
   decreased the amount of time necessary between harvests, increasing
   algal productivity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{One of the major needs for the successful miniaturization of
   microfluidic systems is the integration of portable, low-voltage,
   low-power microvalves to manipulate the fluid flow through a network of
   microchannels. We report here a low-power, thermally actuated,
   elastomer-based microvalve with thermal isolation, which is then
   integrated in a thermoplastic microfluidic device. In the 6-layer design
   of each microvalve, the microfabricated heater that provides the thermal
   energy for the valve actuation is thermally isolated via an insulation
   cavity which reduces the heat dissipation to the surrounding. The
   6-layer all-plastic microvalve was fabricated and showed a 40 \%
   reduction in power consumption compared to the 4-layer design when the
   same duration was used for closing valves. A thermal model using COMSOL
   software was created to obtain further insight to the temperature
   profile in the microvalve region. The model was validated by comparing
   the simulated temperatures with experimentally measured values. The
   simulated values closely agreed with the measured temperatures. In
   addition, a two-step power application was created, which further
   reduced the power requirement. An initial power of 37 mW was used to
   close the valve in 11 s. After closure, a lower second-step power of 12
   mW enabled the valve to remain closed for 15 min, which was only
   one-third of the initial power. By combining structural and operational
   improvement, the overall power consumption of the microvalve was reduced
   by 80 \%. The 6-layer microvalve with two-step operation has the
   potential to realize a battery-operated microfluidic device for
   biological assays.}},

Abstract = {{It has been well documented that deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the
   subthalamic nucleus (STN) to address some of the disabling motor
   symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) can evoke unintended effects,
   especially on non-motor behavior. This observation has catalyzed more
   than a decade of research concentrated on establishing trends and
   identifying potential mechanisms for these non-motor effects. While many
   issues remain unresolved, the collective result of many research studies
   and clinical observations has been a general recognition of the role of
   the STN in mediating limbic function. In particular, the STN has been
   implicated in impulse control and the related construct of valence
   processing. A better understanding of STN involvement in these phenomena
   could have important implications for treating impulse control disorders
   (ICDs). ICDs affect up to 40\% of PD patients on dopamine agonist
   therapy and approximately 15\% of PD patients overall. ICDs have been
   reported to be associated with STN DBS. In this paper we will focus on
   impulse control and review pre-clinical, clinical, behavioral, imaging,
   and electrophysiological studies pertaining to the limbic function of
   the STN.}},

Abstract = {{The exquisite sliding interfaces in the human body share the common
   feature of hydrated dilute polymer mesh networks. These networks,
   especially when they constitute a sliding interface such as the
   pre-corneal tear film on the ocular interface, are described by the
   molecular weight of the polymer chains and a characteristic size of a
   minimum structural unit, the mesh size, . In a Gemini interface where
   hydrophilic hydrogels are slid against each other, the aqueous
   lubrication behavior has been shown to be a function of sliding
   velocity, introducing a sliding timescale competing against the time
   scales of polymer fluctuation and relaxation at the surface. In this
   work, we examine two recent studies and postulate that when the Gemini
   interface slips faster than the single-chain relaxation time, chains
   must relax, suppressing the amplitude of the polymer chain thermal
   fluctuations.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to evaluate the thermal properties of
   geopolymers based on metakaolin (MM) and alternative silica-based
   activators. These activators were produced by mixing rice husk ash (RHA)
   and silica fume (SF) with potassium hydroxide (KOH). In addition, boiler
   slag (BS) was used as partial substitute for the MM aluminosilicates
   precursor. The thermo-physical properties of the geopolymers prepared
   with alternative activators were compared to geopolymers activated with
   commercial potassium silicate (KS). In general, thermal conductivity,
   diffusivity and specific heat are related to porosity of the geopolymer.
   The values of thermal conductivity were between 0.170-0.353 W/m.K. The
   coefficient of thermal expansion varies between 1.06 and 1.13 x 10(-4)
   K-1 and the thermal diffusivity was 0.16-0.27 mm(2)/s. The geopolymer
   with RHA (G-RHA) showed low bulk density (1338 kg/m(3)) and high
   porosity (35\%). Additionally this material has the lowest thermal
   conductivity (0.17 W/m.K) and thermal diffusivity (0.16 mm(2)/s). The
   results obtained show that geopolymers here developed can be considered
   potentially useful for applications such as thermal insulation. In
   addition, they constitute a better ecological choice because of the type
   of source of alkaline activator making their production environmentally
   friendly. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Prevention of muscle atrophy caused by reduced mechanical loading in
   microgravity conditions remains a challenge for long-duration
   spaceflight. To combat leg muscle atrophy, astronauts on the
   International Space Station (ISS) often perform squat exercise using the
   Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED). While the ARED is effective
   at building muscle strength and volume on Earth, NASA researchers do not
   know how closely ARED squat exercise on the ISS replicates Earth-level
   squat muscle moments, or how small variations in exercise form affect
   muscle loading. This study used dynamic simulations of ARED squat
   exercise on the ISS to address these two questions. A multibody dynamic
   model of the complete astronaut-ARED system was constructed in Open-Sim.
   With the ARED base locked to ground and gravity set to 9.81 m/s(2), we
   validated the model by reproducing muscle moments, ground reaction
   forces, and foot center of pressure (CoP) positions for ARED squat
   exercise on Earth. With the ARED base free to move relative to the ISS
   and gravity set to zero, we then used the validated model to simulate
   ARED squat exercise on the ISS for a reference squat motion and eight
   altered squat motions involving changes in anterior-posterior (AP) foot
   or CoP position on the ARED footplate. The reference squat motion
   closely reproduced Earth-level muscle moments for all joints except the
   ankle. For the altered squat motions, changing the foot position was
   more effective at altering muscle moments than was changing the CoP
   position. All CoP adjustments introduced an undesirable shear foot
   reaction force that could cause the feet to slip on the ARED footplate,
   while some foot and CoP adjustments introduced an undesirable sagittal
   plane foot reaction moment that would cause the astronaut to rotate off
   the ARED footplate without the use of some type of foot fixation. Our
   results provide potentially useful information for achieving desired
   increases or decreases in specific muscle moments during ARED squat
   exercise performed on the ISS.}},

Title = {{Response-Spectrum Analysis for Barge Impacts on Bridge Structures}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BRIDGE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Bridge structures that span navigable waterways are inherently at risk
   for barge collision incidents and therefore must be designed for impact
   loading. Current U.S. barge impact analysis procedures consist primarily
   of static load analysis methods that do not explicitly account for
   dynamic effects in barge-bridge collisions, and thus are not ideally
   suited to designing bridge structures to resist barge impacts.
   Therefore, the development of dynamic-analysis methods for estimating
   the responses of bridge structures to barge collisions is warranted.
   Dynamic-analysis procedures that use numerical time-integration
   techniques are capable of capturing pertinent dynamic effects but often
   yield voluminous amounts of time-varying results that must be post
   processed for use in design. In contrast, response-spectrum analysis
   (RSA) procedures are capable of directly producing maximum response
   parameters that are most pertinent to structural design. In this paper,
   an RSA procedure is proposed for use in barge impact analysis of
   bridges. The efficacy of the procedure is demonstrated for a bridge pier
   that was included in a series of full-scale impact experiments. The
   results obtained using the procedure are shown to be conservative when
   compared with data derived from the full-scale experiments. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The factory crane scheduling problem (FCSP) deals with assigning
   delivery tasks to cranes and then sequencing them, in order to minimize
   the total completion time for all tasks. In this paper, delivery tasks
   for required jobs are preemptive allowed at most once before the jobs
   arrive at exit. The preemptive jobs are temporarily stored in a buffer
   stack, in which jobs pickup and delivery should be performed under the
   Last-In-First-Out policy. This feature makes our problem more changeling
   and interesting. In this paper, FCSP is first formulated as an integer
   programming model. Based on properties of the problem, FCSP is then
   reformulated with a much tighter bound. After that, several families of
   valid inequalities are proposed and used within a Branch-and-Cut
   framework. In addition, preprocessing techniques and separation
   heuristics are used to improve algorithm efficiency. Computational
   experiments are carried out on practical data collected from the steel
   company. The results support both effectiveness and efficiency of the
   model refinements as well as the Branch-and-Cut algorithm proposed.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this study, smart irrigation controllers were targeted toward
   single-family potable water customers in Orange County, Florida with
   excessive landscape irrigation patterns. Out of five treatments, four
   treatments received either an evapotranspiration controller (ET) or soil
   moisture sensor (SMS) controller, installed by a contractor, but two
   technology treatments included an educational program (+Pgm) component.
   The fifth treatment was a comparison treatment (MO) with no
   interventions to their normal irrigation scheduling methods. After 22
   months of evaluation, both +Pgm treatments reduced irrigation
   application, ranging from 21 to 52\%. However, none of the treatments
   performed with high efficiency in all seasons. Only a few treatments
   were able to maintain irrigation totals within a gross irrigation
   requirement (GIR) range from 60 to 100\% efficiency. The technology
   treatments that participated in the customized educational program were
   more likely to achieve additional reductions in irrigation application
   compared with the technology only treatments. Additionally, there was
   higher consistency in efficient irrigation application by the SMS
   technology than the ET technology. The SMS+Pgm was the most efficient
   regardless of soil type with weekly irrigation for SMS+Pgm averaging
   11-13 mm per week in the flatwoods locations and water savings of
   34-52\% across all seasons. In the sand locations, weekly irrigation
   averaged 16-22 mm for ET+Pgm, SMS, and SMS+Pgm, resulting in very little
   difference among these treatments. Dry season water savings for these
   three treatments was 4-35\% with increased savings of 21-43\% in the wet
   seasons. The ET controllers may require technological advancement
   combined with additional educational opportunities to achieve the same
   consistency of water savings as the SMS. Additional irrigation reduction
   is possible with both controllers tested here in most cases and may be
   achieved with education or additional customized programming and setup.

Title = {{Determination of hurricane-induced barge impact loads on floodwalls
   using dynamic finite element analysis}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{104}},
Pages = {{95-106}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{During hurricane events, moored barges are at risk of being propelled by
   high winds and impacting flood protection walls in the vicinity. Cities
   like New Orleans, Louisiana are at particular risk for such hazards, due
   to the preponderance of canals and moored barges throughout the city
   combined with high hurricane risk. Unfortunately, limited information is
   available to estimate the magnitude of barge impact loads for the design
   of floodwalls. In this paper, forces associated with
   hurricane-wind-propelled barge impacts on floodwalls are quantified
   using high-resolution dynamic finite element simulations. Such
   simulations account for highly nonlinear material deformation in the
   impacting barge, nonlinear soil response, and dynamic interaction
   between the barge, wall, and soil. The paper presents force histories
   for a variety of representative impact scenarios which can be used
   directly in dynamic analysis of floodwalls. Additional guidance is
   provided for employing the force results in static design scenarios. (C)

Title = {{Hydrologic implications of smoldering fires in wetland landscapes}},
Journal = {{FRESHWATER SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1394-1405}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Smoldering fires in organic soils have negative effects on air quality
   and motorist safety as well as global implications from their release of
   large quantities of refractory C. However, the ecological implications
   of their occurrence are relatively unexplored despite their potential
   importance to the management of wetland ecosystems. We developed a
   conceptual model of the ecohydrologic implications of peat-consuming
   fires that explores the interactive effects of fire, hydrology, and C
   dynamics on hydrology. We modify an existing wetland hydrology model
   parameterized with climate, soil, and spatial data from a low-relief
   region in southern Florida (USA) to explore hypothesized pyrogeomorphic
   changes to upland water table elevation, wetland inundation (depth and
   hydroperiod), and groundwater exchange as a function of fire severity
   (area and depth of burn). Smoldering fires increase hydroperiod and
   storage in organic soils in burned wetlands by changing soil elevation.
   After fire, negative feedbacks to fire occurrence are likely because of
   increased hydroperiods in burned areas. However, adjacent, unburned
   wetland areas and uplands may experience drier conditions that increase
   fire frequency in distal locations. Simulation results indicate that
   increasing the area of soil combustion or depth of burn increases
   wetland hydroperiod, flooding depths, and groundwater exchange between
   wetlands and surrounding uplands. Additional field data characterizing
   fire effects on organic soil elevations and wetland bathymetry are
   needed, but the model supports our hypothesis about the effects of
   soil-consuming fires on hydrology and habitat, and these results will
   inform future work on the ecological role of peat-consuming fires.}},

Title = {{Effect of Slip on Circulation Inside a Droplet}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Internal recirculation in a moving droplet, enforced by the presence of
   fluid-fluid interfaces, plays an important role in several droplet-based
   microfluidic devices as it could enhance mixing, heat transfer, and
   chemical reaction. The effect of slip on droplet circulation is studied
   for two canonical steady-state problems: two-phase Couette,
   boundary-driven, and Poiseuille, pressure/body force-driven, flows. A
   simple model is established to estimate the circulation in a droplet and
   capture the effect of slip and aspect ratio on the droplet circulation.
   The circulation in a droplet is shown to decrease with increasing slip
   length in the case of a boundary-driven flow, while for a body
   force-driven flow it is independent of slip length. Scaling parameters
   for circulation and slip length are identified from the circulation
   model. The model is validated using continuum and molecular dynamics
   (MD) simulations. The effect of slip at the fluid-fluid interface on
   circulation is also briefly discussed. The results suggest that active
   manipulation of velocity slip, e.g., through actuation of
   hydrophobicity, could be employed to control droplet circulation and
   consequently its mixing rate.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-human multi-robot interaction is a complex system in which robots,
   e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles, may share information with a group of
   human operators to perform geographically-dispersed priority-based tasks
   within a specified time. In this complex system, the key is to optimally
   allocate tasks comprising of high-risk and low-risk information at
   multiple-levels in order to maximize effectiveness of the entire system
   given the limited resources. A multi-level programming model is
   developed in which an agent allocates information received from multiple
   robots to multiple team leaders who in turn distribute information to
   operators within their teams. The objective of the agent is to optimally
   allocate tasks to multiple team leaders to maximize the overall system
   performance and to minimize the processing cost and time while
   considering human factors. The developed model is solved using backward
   induction and details are presented in reverse time sequence. If human
   factors are included along with the productivity metrics then the
   performance of the multi-human multi-robot interaction systems can be
   improved.}},

Abstract = {{We measured the valence band offset of sputtered ZrSiOx (bandgap 5.9 eV)
   on InGaZnO4 (IGZO) using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and the
   bandgaps of these materials using either absorption or reflection
   electron energy loss spectroscopy. This enabled us to additionally
   derive the conduction band offsets. We examined the effect of venting
   the samples prior to dielectric deposition on the band offsets compared
   to keeping them in vacuum. The ZrSiOx/IGZO system has a staggered, type
   II alignment, with a valence band offset of -0.12 eV +/- 0.04 eV for
   samples in which all the layers were kept in vacuum or 0.05 eV for
   samples exposed to atmosphere prior to the measurement. The conduction
   band offset for ZrSiOx/IGZO was derived as 2.86 eV for the vacuum
   samples from the measured bandgap of the IGZO (3.16 eV) and 2.93 eV for
   vented samples. The small valence band offsets in this system are
   consistent with past reports that ZrO2/IGZO has essentially no valence
   band offset. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Removing chiral contamination of lactate solutions by selective

Abstract = {{Objective A bio-based process is appealing for purification of l-lactic
   acid, the major enantiomer of polylactic acid syrup, generated by
   thermochemical processes at the end of life of PLA-based plastics, from
   its chiral impurity, d-lactic acid, before reuse.
   Results Polylactic acid (PLA), a renewable alternative to
   petroleum-derived plastics, contains a mixture of l- and d-lactic acid
   (LA) isomers with the l-isomer dominating (up to 95 \%). A novel
   bio-based process was developed to produce chirally pure l-LA from syrup
   produced during recycling of PLA-plastics. This process utilizes an
   engineered Escherichia coli (strain DC1001) containing novel gene
   deletions (lld, ykg) that eliminated the oxidative metabolism of
   l-lactate, leaving the membrane-bound d-lactate dehydrogenases to
   selectively metabolize the d-isomer. Strain DC1001 removed 8.7 g
   d-lactate l(-1) from a PLA-syrup containing 135 g total lactic acid
   l(-1) in 24 h. Average rates of removal of d-lactic acid were 0.25 g
   d-lactate h(-1) (g cell dry weight)(-1) and 0.36 g d-lactate l(-1)
   h(-1).
   Conclusion Bio-based purification of PLA-syrup utilizing E. coli strain
   DC1001 is an attractive process step during recycling of PLA-plastics.
   This selective oxidation process can also be used to remove chiral
   contamination of l-lactate in medical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS), which entails synthesizing proteins
   outside of intact cells, is conducted in several formats with the
   continuous-exchange cell-free (CECF) format generally having the
   greatest protein expression yields. With this format, continuous
   chemical exchange occurs through a dialysis membrane separating a
   reaction solution from a feeding solution containing supplemental
   nutrient/energy molecules. Here, we describe the optimization of the
   miniaturized fluid array device (mu FAD) by studying the effects of
   structural and experimental parameters responsible for the heightened
   chemical exchange across the dialysis membranes and enhanced protein
   expression capabilities of the high-throughput device. The interface
   area and number between the reaction and feeding solutions have a direct
   impact on protein expression, with a 1.6\% enhancement in protein
   expression yield with each square millimeter increase in area and a 20\%
   decrease with each additional interface. For nutrient/energy
   availability, an increasing solution volume ratio and height difference
   increase protein expression yield until the expression yield plateaus at
   a volume ratio of 20 to 1 (feeding to reaction solution) and a solution
   height difference of 2mm. This yield can be further increased by 7\%
   every 30min with feeding solution replacement. Of the studied
   experimental factors (feeding solution stirring, device shaking, and
   temperature increase), feeding solution stirring has a significant
   effect on protein expression in this device. In the optimized system,
   green fluorescent protein (GFP), ss-glucuronidase (GUS),
   ss-galactosidase (LacZ), luciferase, and tissue plasminogen activator
   (tPA) expression increased 77.8-, 212-, 3.66-, 463-, and 5.43-fold,
   respectively, compared to the conventional batch format in a standard
   microplate. These results highlight the significance of
   structural/experimental conditions on the productive expression of
   proteins in the CECF format. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2015;112: 2459-2467.

Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{767-779}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Since the discovery of low-dimensional carbon allotropes, there is
   increasing interest in using carbon nanomaterials for biomedical
   applications. Carbon nanomaterials have been utilized in the biomedical
   field for bioimaging, chemical sensing, targeting, delivery,
   therapeutics, catalysis, and energy harvesting. Each application
   requires tailored surface functionalization in order to take advantage
   of a desired property of the nanoparticles. Herein, we review the
   surface immobilization of bio-molecules, including proteins, peptides,
   and enzymes, and present the recent advances in synthesis and
   applications of these conjugates. The carbon scaffold and the biological
   moiety form a complex interface which presents a challenge for achieving
   efficient and robust binding while preserving biological activity.
   Moreover, some applications require the utilization of the
   protein-nanocarbon system in a complex environment that may hinder its
   performance or activity. We analyze different strategies to overcome
   these challenges when using carbon nanomaterials as protein carriers,
   explore various immobilization techniques along with characterization
   methods, and present recent demonstrations of employing these systems
   for biomedical applications. Finally, we consider the challenges and
   future directions of this field. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   asymmetry}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a systematic experimental investigation of the
   room-temperature mechanical response of polycrystalline commercially
   pure molybdenum (Mo) is presented. It was established that the material
   has ductility in tension at 10(-5)/s and that the failure strain is
   strongly dependent on the orientation. A specimen taken along the
   rolling direction sustains large axial strains (20\%), while a specimen
   taken at an angle of 45 degrees to the rolling direction could only
   sustain 5\% strain. It was observed that irrespective of the loading
   orientation the yield stress in uniaxial compression is larger than in
   uniaxial tension. While in tension the material has a strong anisotropy
   in Lankford coefficients, in uniaxial compression it displays weak
   strain-anisotropy. An elastic-plastic orthotropic model that accounts
   for all the specificities of the plastic deformation of the material was
   developed. Validation of the model was done through comparison with data
   on notched specimens. Quantitative agreement with both global and local
   strain fields was obtained. In particular, the effect of loading
   orientation on the response was very well described. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Strong reciprocal interactions exist between landscape patterns and
   ecological processes. In wetlands, hydrology is the dominant abiotic
   driver of ecological processes and both controls, and is controlled, by
   vegetation presence and patterning. We focus on binary patterning in the
   Everglades ridge-slough landscape, where longitudinally connected flow,
   principally in sloughs, is integral to landscape function. Patterning
   controls discharge competence in this low-gradient peatland, with
   important feedbacks on hydroperiod and thus peat accretion and patch
   transitions.
   To quantitatively predict pattern effects on hydrologic connectivity and
   thus hydroperiod.
   We evaluated three pattern metrics that vary in their hydrologic
   specificity. (1) Landscape discharge competence considers elongation and
   patch-type density that capture geostatistical landscape features. (2)
   Directional connectivity index (DCI) extracts both flow path and
   direction based on graph theory. (3) Least flow cost (LFC) is based on a
   global spatial distance algorithm strongly analogous to landscape water
   routing, where ridges have higher flow cost than sloughs because of
   their elevation and vegetation structure. Metrics were evaluated in
   comparison to hydroperiod estimated using a numerically intensive
   hydrologic model for synthetic landscapes. Fitted relationships between
   metrics and hydroperiod for synthetic landscapes were extrapolated to
   contemporary and historical maps to explore hydroperiod trends in space
   and time.
   Both LFC and DCI were excellent predictors of hydroperiod and useful for
   diagnosing how the modern landscape has reorganized in response to
   modified hydrology.
   Metric simplicity and performance indicates potential to provide
   hydrologically explicit, computationally simple, and spatially
   independent predictions of landscape hydrology, and thus effectively
   measure of restoration performance.}},

Abstract = {{Pedestrian and driver behaviors as well as their interactions, are
   essential in planning, designing and operating highway facilities.
   Pedestrian crossing outside of a marked or unmarked crosswalk (i.e.
   jaywalking), is one of those pedestrian behaviors that may highly affect
   safety and operations. Unlike permissible crossings at crosswalks,
   jaywalking events are not often anticipated by drivers, which may result
   in less driver reaction time and different vehicle operation dynamics.
   It is important to understand pedestrian crossing behavior outside of
   crosswalks, as well as driver yielding behavior towards them. To date,
   limited quantitative and behavioral research has been conducted to
   investigate this interaction or simulate it microscopically. This paper
   aims to explore both pedestrian jaywalking behavior (gap acceptance and
   speeds) and the corresponding driver reactions (yielding behavior) for
   modeling the vehicle-pedestrian interactions (VPI) outside the
   crosswalks in a micro-simulation environment. The study also quantifies
   the differences between vehicle-jaywalker and vehicle-permissible
   crossing. An observational study and an instrumented vehicle study were
   conducted on the campus of the University of Florida to collect data
   from pedestrian and driver perspectives, respectively.
   Crossing speed, yield acceptance and delay of jaywalking crossings and
   permissible crossings were observed in the study and these attributed
   can be used for replicating pedestrian operations in simulators.
   Moreover, behaviors of driver approaching jaywalkers versus pedestrians
   crossing at designated crosswalks were compared on the basis of yield
   rates, and vehicle speed profiles. Vehicle yield dynamics were analyzed
   to model the driver reactions towards jaywalkers. Lastly, it was found
   that the locations of jaywalking events are highly concentrated and
   influenced by the crossing environment, such as pedestrian and vehicular
   volume, bus stops presence and crossing distance.
   This paper establishes several quantitative relationships describing
   interactions between pedestrians crossing outside of crosswalks and
   approaching drivers, which provide the basis and assumptions for
   modeling such interactions in a micro-simulation environment for traffic
   operational analyses. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study a robust single-machine scheduling problem under
   four alternative optimization criteria: minimizing total completion
   time, minimizing total weighted completion time, minimizing maximum
   lateness, and minimizing the number of late jobs. We assume that job
   processing times are subject to uncertainty. Accordingly, we construct
   three alternative uncertainty sets, each of which defines job processing
   times that can simultaneously occur. The robust optimization framework
   assumes that, given a job schedule, a worst-case set of processing times
   will be realized from among those allowed by the uncertainty set under
   consideration. For each combination of objective function and
   uncertainty set, we first analyze the problem of identifying a set of
   worst-case processing times with respect to a fixed schedule, and then
   investigate the problem of selecting a schedule whose worst-case
   objective is minimal.}},

Abstract = {{Large eddy simulation of flow and passive scalar transport in a stirred

   multi-domain method. The time sequence of concentration and flow fields
   are explored to investigate the dependency of the concentration
   development on the flow structure. The sharp gradients of the
   instantaneous and mean concentrations are distributed around the center
   of larger ring vortices at high molecular diffusivity. With decreasing
   molecular diffusivity and increasing Reynolds number, the distribution
   of concentration becomes much uniform. The eddy diffusivity and subgrid
   scale dissipation are widely spread from the impeller jet toward outer

   diminished with increasing Reynolds number and decreasing the molecular

Abstract = {{In this work, a novel approach was developed to prepare an engineered
   biochar from KMnO4 treated hickory wood through slow pyrolysis (600
   degrees C). Characterization experiments with various tools showed that
   the engineered biochar surface was covered with MnOx ultrafine
   particles. In comparison to the pristine biochar, the engineered biochar
   also had more surface oxygen-containing functional groups and much
   larger surface area. Batch sorption experiments showed that the
   engineered biochar had strong sorption ability to Pb(II), Cu(II), and
   Cd(II) with maximum sorption capacities of 153.1, 34.2, and 28.1 mg/g,
   respectively, which were significantly higher than that of the pristine
   biochar. Batch sorption experiments also showed that the dosage, initial
   solution pH, and ionic strength affected the removal of the heavy metals
   by the biochars. The removal of the metals by the engineered biochar was
   mainly through surface adsorption mechanisms involving both the surface
   MnOx particles and oxygen-containing groups. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a stacked common-mode (CM) inductor for
   electromagnetic interference (EMI) attenuation. The proposed stacked CM
   inductor consists of two CM inductors with identical cores and the same
   number of winding turns but with opposite winding directions. The
   proposed stacked CM inductor has three advantages. First, it is much
   less susceptible to external magnetic field interference than
   conventional CM inductors. This suppresses the EMI due to the
   near-magnetic-field coupling to the CM inductor. Second, the proposed
   winding structure effectively increases the leakage inductance of the CM
   inductor, which enhances its ability to suppress differential-mode (DM)
   noise. Third, the magnetic field generated by the DM current in the
   stacked CM inductor is partially canceled outside of the inductor. As a
   result, the stacked CM inductor has lower magnetic field emission than
   that of a conventional CM inductor. Simulation and experimental results
   validate the advantages of the proposed CM inductor, which show the
   proposed technique greatly improves the performance of CM inductors.}},

Title = {{A two steps procedure in state estimation gross error detection,

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{484-490}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a two steps approach for the power system state estimation
   is proposed. The first step is the gross error detection test when all
   the measurements are assumed as possible of having errors. With that
   assumption, a rule for the measurement's weights as being the inverse of
   a constant percentage of the measurement's magnitudes is proposed. Then,
   using the error as the objective function of the state estimation (SE)
   process to be minimized, the gross error analysis is performed. In case
   a gross error is detected, the Composed Measurement Error, in its
   normalized form (CMEN), is used to identify the measurement(s) with
   error(s). The measurement(s) with error(s) is corrected using the
   Composed Normalized Error (CNE). In the second step, the state
   estimation is again performed, but using as the weight for each
   measurement the inverse of the measurement's standard deviation as
   proposed in the classical estimators. In this step, the set of measures
   is the original set, but with the measures flagged with gross errors
   replaced by their estimated values. The IEEE-14, IEEE-57 bus systems and
   the 45-bus equivalent of the Southern part of Brazil are used to perform
   the tests. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Depolymerization of procyanidin polymers into oligomers enhances their
   bioavailability and bioactivity because oligomers are bioavailable.
   Hydrogenolysis was applied in this study to depolymerize hi-tannin
   sorghum bran procyanidin polymers into oligomers. The yield and
   composition of oligomers under different hydrogenolysis conditions was
   investigated. Results showed that raising temperature from 50 to 100
   degrees C significantly increased total yield of oligomers. Higher
   temperatures (150 and 200 degrees C) produced monomers with lower yield.
   The highest yield of oligomers (38.8\%) was obtained using 1 MPa
   hydrogen whereas 3 MPa hydrogen in reaction vessel decreased yield.
   Total yield of oligomers reached the highest at 1-3 h and then decreased
   with prolonged reaction time. Yield increased with palladium-on-carbon
   (Pd/C, a catalyst) amount from 0.5 to 3 mg and plateaued with Pd/C
   amount from 3 to 10 mg. The maximum yield of produced oligomers was
   achieved under 100 degrees C, 1 MPa hydrogen pressure, 1-3 h, and 3-10
   mg Pd/C. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Intense para-hydrogen-enhanced NMR signals are observed in the
   hydrogenation of propene and propyne over ceria nanocubes,
   nano-octahedra, and nanorods. The well-defined ceria shapes, synthesized
   by a hydrothermal method, expose different crystalline facets with
   various oxygen vacancy densities, which are known to play a role in
   hydrogenation and oxidation catalysis. While the catalytic activity of
   the hydrogenation of propene over ceria is strongly facet-dependent, the
   pairwise selectivity is low (2.4\% at 375 degrees C), which is
   consistent with stepwise H atom transfer, and it is the same for all
   three nanocrystal shapes. Selective semi-hydrogenation of propyne over
   ceria nanocubes yields hyperpolarized propene with a similar pairwise
   selectivity of (2.7\% at 300 degrees C), indicating product formation
   predominantly by a non-pairwise addition. Ceria is also shown to be an
   efficient pairwise replacement catalyst for propene.}},

Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{The high demand of electricity makes power networks more vulnerable
   under cascading failures. Because of the operational dependencies
   between nodes, the failure of a small set of nodes can cause a large
   cascade of failures which results in the breakdown of the network. Thus,
   it is crucial to study the vulnerability of the power network under the
   cascading failures.
   In this paper, we study the cascading critical node (CasCN) problem
   which asks to find a set of nodes whose failure maximizes the number of
   failed nodes under the effect of cascading failures. We first show that
   the problem is NP-hard to approximate within the factor of O
   (n(1-epsilon)). We then design a new metric to evaluate the importance
   of nodes in the network and use it as the base to design the Fully
   Adaptive Cascading Potential algorithm. In the case where the network is
   robust, we propose an alternative algorithm, the Cooperating Attack
   algorithm, which includes several novel properties to solve the problem.
   Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of proposed algorithms and
   provide more insight into the vulnerability of the power network. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper presents a frequency detection based inductive eddy current
   sensing mechanism to simultaneously sense the piston position and tilt
   angle of the mirror plate of large vertical displacement micromirrors
   that exhibit piston scan ranges above 100 mu m. This is accomplished by
   sensing the inductance change, and thus resonant frequency shift, of two
   microfabricated sensing coils packaged underneath the mirror plate. For
   demonstration purpose, the coils were paired with discrete circuit
   components to oscillate at 11.9MHz and 12.5 MHz, respectively. The
   piston position and tilt angle of the mirror plate could be
   simultaneously monitored over a 500 mu m piston scan range, achieving a
   maximum piston sensitivity of 4.15 kHz/mu m with a piston sensing
   resolution of 96 nm and a maximum tilt angle sensitivity of 60.5
   kHz/degrees with a tilt angle sensing resolution of 0.0013 degrees.
   Analytical modeling of the coil inductance change via image theory was
   also conducted, showing that the sensor sensitivity and resolution could
   be improved by increasing the coil oscillation frequency and decreasing
   the coil size. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Solar thermochemical energy storage has enormous potential for enabling
   cost-effective concentrated solar power (CSP). A thermochemical storage
   system based on a SrO/SrCO3 carbonation cycle offers the ability to
   store and release high temperature (approximate to 1200 degrees C) heat.
   The energy density of SrCO3/SrO systems supported by zirconia-based
   sintering inhibitors was investigated for 15 cycles of exothermic
   carbonation at 1150 degrees C followed by decomposition at 1235 degrees
   C. A sample with 40wt\% of SrO supported by yttria-stabilized zirconia
   (YSZ) shows good energy storage stability at 1450MJm(-3) over fifteen
   cycles at the same cycling temperatures. After further testing over 45
   cycles, a decrease in energy storage capacity to 1260MJm(-3) is observed
   during the final cycle. The decrease is due to slowing carbonation
   kinetics, and the original value of energy density may be obtained by
   lengthening the carbonation steps.}},

Abstract = {{Instructive biomaterials capable of controlling the behaviour of the
   cells are particularly interesting scaffolds for tissue engineering and
   regenerative medicine. Novel biomaterials are particularly important in
   societies with rapidly aging populations, where demand for organ/tissue
   donations is greater than their supply. Herein we describe the
   preparation of electrically conductive silk film-based nerve tissue
   scaffolds that are manufactured using all aqueous processing. Aqueous
   solutions of Bombyx mori silk were cast on flexible polydimethylsiloxane
   substrates with micrometer-scale grooves on their surfaces, allowed to
   dry, and annealed to impart -sheets to the silk which assures that the
   materials are stable for further processing in water. The silk films
   were rendered conductive by generating an interpenetrating network of
   polypyrrole and polystyrenesulfonate in the silk matrix. Films were
   incubated in an aqueous solution of pyrrole (monomer),
   polystyrenesulfonate (dopant) and iron chloride (initiator), after which
   they were thoroughly washed to remove low molecular weight components
   (monomers, initiators, and oligomers) and dried, yielding conductive
   films with sheet resistances of 124 +/- 23ksquare(-1). The
   micrometer-scale grooves that are present on the surface of the films
   are analogous to the natural topography in the extracellular matrix of
   various tissues (bone, muscle, nerve, skin) to which cells respond.
   Dorsal root ganglions (DRG) adhere to the films and the grooves in the
   surface of the films instruct the aligned growth of processes extending
   from the DRG. Such materials potentially enable the electrical
   stimulation (ES) of cells cultured on them, and future in vitro studies
   will focus on understanding the interplay between electrical and
   topographical cues on the behaviour of cells cultured on them.}},

Abstract = {{The dose coefficients for the eye lens reported in ICRP 2010 Publication
   116 were calculated using both a stylized model and the ICRP-110
   reference phantoms, according to the type of radiation, energy, and
   irradiation geometry. To maintain consistency of lens dose assessment,
   in the present study we incorporated the ICRP-116 detailed eye model
   into the converted polygon-mesh (PM) version of the ICRP-110 reference
   phantoms. After the incorporation, the dose coefficients for the eye
   lens were calculated and compared with those of the ICRP-116 data. The
   results showed generally a good agreement between the newly calculated
   lens dose coefficients and the values of ICRP 2010 Publication 116.
   Significant differences were found for some irradiation cases due mainly
   to the use of different types of phantoms. Considering that the PM
   version of the ICRP-110 reference phantoms preserve the original
   topology of the ICRP-110 reference phantoms, it is believed that the PM
   version phantoms, along with the detailed eye model, provide more
   reliable and consistent dose coefficients for the eye lens.}},

Abstract = {{The Gravity Probe B satellite used ultra-precise gyroscopes in low Earth
   orbit to compare the orientation of the local inertial reference frame
   with that of distant space in order to test predictions of general
   relativity. The experiment required that the Gravity Probe B spacecraft
   have milliarcsecond-level attitude knowledge for the science
   measurement, and milliarcsecond-level control to minimize classical
   torques acting on the science gyroscopes. The primary sensor was a
   custom Cassegrainian telescope, which measured the pitch and yaw angles
   of the experiment package with respect to a guide star. The spacecraft
   rolled uniformly about the direction to the guide star, and the roll
   angle was measured by star trackers. Attitude control was performed with
   sixteen proportional thrusters that used boil-off from the experiment's
   liquid Helium cryogen as propellant. This paper summarizes the attitude
   control system's design and on-orbit performance.}},

Abstract = {{We present second-order molecular cluster perturbation theory (MCPT(2)),
   a linear scaling methodology to calculate arbitrarily large systems with
   explicit calculation of individual wave functions in a coupled-cluster
   framework. This new MCPT(2) framework uses coupled-cluster perturbation
   theory and an expansion in terms of molecular dimer interactions to
   obtain molecular wave functions that are infinite order in both the
   electronic fluctuation operator and all possible dimer (and products of
   dimers) interactions. The MCPT(2) framework has been implemented in the
   new SIA/Aces4 parallel architecture, making use of the advanced dynamic
   memory control and fine-grained parallelism to perform very large
   explicit molecular cluster calculations. To illustrate the power of this
   method, we have computed energy shifts, lattice site dipole moments, and
   harmonic vibrational frequencies via explicit calculation of the bulk
   system for the polar and non-polar polymorphs of solid hydrogen
   fluoride. The explicit lattice size (without using any periodic boundary
   conditions) was expanded up to 1000 HF molecules, with 32,000 basis
   functions and 10,000 electrons. Our obtained HF lattice site dipole
   moments and harmonic vibrational frequencies agree well with the

Abstract = {{Achieving selective C-H bond cleavage is critical for developing
   catalytic processes that transform small alkanes to value-added
   products. The present study clarifies the molecular-level origin for an
   exceptionally strong preference for propane to dissociate on the
   crystalline PdO(101) surface via primary C-H bond cleavage. Using
   reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) and density
   functional theory (DFT) calculations, we show that adsorbed propane
   sigma-complexes preferentially adopt geometries on PdO(101) in which
   only primary C-H bonds datively interact with the surface Pd atoms at
   low propane coverages and are thus activated under typical catalytic
   reaction conditions. We show that a propane molecule achieves maximum
   stability on PdO(101) by adopting a bidentate geometry in which a H-Pd
   dative bond forms at each CH3 group. These results demonstrate that
   structural registry between the molecule and surface can strongly
   influence the selectivity of a metal oxide surface in activating alkane
   C-H bonds.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces and studies the minimum edge blocker dominating
   set problem (EBDP), which is formulated as follows. Given a
   vertex-weighted undirected graph and r> 0, remove a minimum number of
   edges so that the weight of any dominating set in the remaining graph is
   at least r. Dominating sets are used in a wide variety of graph-based
   applications such as the analysis of wireless and social networks. We
   show that the decision version of EBDP is NP-hard for any fixed r> 0. We
   present an analytical lower bound for the value of an optimal solution
   to EBDP and formulate this problem as a linear 0-1 program with a large
   number of constraints. We also study the convex hull of feasible
   solutions to EBDP and identify facet-inducing inequalities for this
   polytope. Furthermore, we develop the first exact algorithm for solving
   EBDP, which solves the proposed formulation by a branch-and-cut approach
   where nontrivial constraints are applied in a lazy fashion. Finally, we
   also provide the computational results obtained by using our approach on
   a test-bed of randomly generated instances and real-life power-law
   graphs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Association of European Operational

Title = {{Optimization of synthesis and peptization steps to obtain iron oxide

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{394}},
Pages = {{361-371}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic Fluid Hyperthermia (MFH) uses heat generated by magnetic
   nanoparticles exposed to alternating magnetic fields to cause a
   temperature increase in tumors to the hyperthermia range (43-47 degrees
   C), inducing apoptotic cancer cell death. As with all cancer
   nanomedicines, one of the most significant challenges with MFH is
   achieving high nanoparticle accumulation at the tumor site This
   motivates development of synthesis strategies that maximize the rate of
   energy dissipation of iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles, preferable clue
   to their intrinsic biocompatibility. This has led to development of
   synthesis strategies that although attractive from the point of view of
   chemical elegance, may not be suitable for scale-up to quantities
   necessary for clinical use. On the other hand, to date the aqueous
   co-precipitation synthesis, which readily yields gram quantities of
   nanoparticles, has only been reported to yield sufficiently high
   specific absorption rates after laborious size selective fractionation.
   This work focuses on improvements to the aqueous co-precipitation of
   iron oxide nanoparticles to increase the specific absorption rate (SAR),
   by optimizing synthesis conditions and the subsequent peptization step.
   Heating efficiencies up to 1048 W/g(Fe) (36.5 kA/m, 341 kHz; ILP=2.3 nH
   m(2) kg(-1)) were obtained, which represent one of the highest values
   reported for iron oxide particles synthesized by co-precipitation
   without size selective fractionation. Furthermore, particles reached SAR
   values of up to 719 W/g(Fe) (36.5 kA/m, 341 kHz; ILP=1.6 nH m(2) kg(-1))
   when in a solid matrix, demonstrating they were capable of significant
   rates of energy dissipation even when restricted from physical rotation.
   Reduction in energy dissipation rate due to immobilization has been
   identified as an obstacle to clinical translation of MFH. Hence,
   particles obtained with the conditions reported here have great
   potential for application in nanoscale thermal cancer therapy. (C) 2015

Title = {{Optimizing network objectives in collaborative content distribution}},
Journal = {{Computer Networks}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{244-261}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{One of the important trends is that the Internet will be used to
   transfer content on more and more massive scale. Collaborative
   distribution techniques such as swarming and parallel download have been
   invented and effectively applied to end-user file-sharing or
   media-streaming applications, but mostly for improving end-user
   performance objectives. In this paper, we consider the issues that arise
   from applying these techniques to content distribution networks for
   improving network objectives, such as reducing network congestion. In
   particular, we formulate the problem of how to make many-to-many
   assignment from the sending nodes to the receivers and allocate
   bandwidth for every connection, subject to the node capacity and
   receiving rate constraints. The objective is to minimize the worst link
   congestion over the network, which is equivalent to maximizing the
   distribution throughput, or minimizing the distribution time. The
   optimization framework allows us to jointly consider server load
   balancing, network congestion control, as well as the requirement of the
   receivers. We develop a special, diagonally-scaled gradient projection
   algorithm, which has a faster convergence speed, and hence, better
   scalability with respect to the network size than a standard subgradient
   algorithm. We provide both a synchronous algorithm and a more practical
   asynchronous algorithm. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Cycling emergy: computing emergy in trophic networks}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MODELLING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{315}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{37-45}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{While cycles are a very important phenomena of ecosystems, they
   represent a methodological challenge in emergy accounting. The relevance
   of feedbacks is acknowledged in emergy evaluations, however they are not
   considered by the emergy algebra. In this paper, we present supporting
   arguments in favor of an update in the emergy accounting methodology. We
   argue that including the contribution of feedback emergy is essential to
   understand a system's internal functioning, thus studies interested in
   better capturing these features should consider emergy cycling.
   Feedbacks represent emergy that entered the system in the past
   (therefore it is not double counting), and they enable additional
   organization and work above that supported by input emergy alone.
   To evaluate the effect upon system properties of including feedbacks, we
   compared two different methods for calculating transformities using
   trophic networks as case studies. One method followed the classic emergy
   rules where feedbacks were not included, and the other included the
   feedbacks (we refer to them as static and network method, respectively).
   The comparison between the resulting transformities and system emergy
   patterns showed that (1) transformities and system emergy were
   significantly higher with the network method, and (2) this increase

Title = {{New method to compute the emergy of crustal minerals}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MODELLING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{315}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{108-115}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{To date, Unit Emergy Values (UEVs) for crustal minerals (e.g. limestone,
   iron ore, etc.) have lacked thermodynamic basis and suffer from overly
   vague generalization (relative to most other, more certain emergy
   indicators). We assume a steady state crustal cycle that embodies the
   various forms of exergy supporting Earth system cycles. The UEV of
   average crust is 1.75E + 09 solar emergy joules per gram (specific
   emergy). The ratio of crustal specific emergy to a mineral's exergy
   density (exergy per mass) is the mineral's transformity. This is an
   important assertion as it is the dissipation of exergy which
   hierarchically organizes materials. Emergy accounting should be able to
   express every resource either a transformity or specific emergy, linked
   by exergy density; crustal minerals are no exception.
   Mineral transformity can be characterized using either chemical exergy
   or Gibb's formation energy. Both calculations use the same mixing term
   which depends on average crustal abundance of the mineral. Also it's
   possible to account mineral emergy using either total free energy (or
   total chemical exergy) or by accounting only the mixing exergy. Four
   herein proposed methods yield a wide range of specific emergies for each
   of the prominent mineral/metal inputs to economies. We conclude that the
   exergy of concentration (mixing exergy) best represents that which is
   destroyed in mining/extraction activities and that using Gibb's
   transformities better suit the emergy method due to chemical exergies
   being positive or negative depending on the mineral. The emergy
   accounting of minerals should utilize Gibb's transformities and account
   only the emergy of a mineral's mixing exergy because this represents the
   natural capital that is irrevocably destroyed in mineral harvesting. (C)

   magnetic particle imaging}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is an emerging imaging technique that
   uses magnetic nanoparticles as tracers. In order to analyze the quality
   of nanoparticles developed for MPI, a Magnetic Particle Spectrometer
   (MPS) is often employed. In this paper, we describe results for
   predictions of the nanoparticle harmonic spectra obtained in a MPS using
   three models: the first uses the Langevin function, which does not take
   into account finite magnetic relaxation; the second model uses the
   magnetization equation by Shliomis (Sh), which takes into account finite
   magnetic relaxation using a constant characteristic time scale; and the
   third model uses the magnetization equation derived by Martsenyuk,
   Raikher, and Shliomis (MRSh), which takes into account the effect of
   magnetic field magnitude on the magnetic relaxation time. We make
   comparisons between these models and with experiments in order to
   illustrate the effects of field-dependent relaxation in the MPS. The
   models results suggest that finite relaxation results in a significant
   drop in signal intensity (magnitude of individual harmonics) and in
   faster spectral decay. Interestingly, when field dependence of the
   magnetic relaxation time was taken into account, through the MRSh model,
   the simulations predict a significant improvement in the performance of
   the nanoparticles, as compared to the performance predicted by the Sh
   equation. The comparison between the predictions from models and
   experimental measurements showed excellent qualitative as well as
   quantitative agreement up to the 19th harmonic using the Sh and MRSh
   equations, highlighting the potential of ferrohydrodynamic modeling in
   MPI. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{165}},
Pages = {{97-103}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{In shallow lakes of Florida laden with low-strength organic-rich
   sediments, wind-induced water movement is believed to actuate bed
   surface erosion as well as mass erosion. Experiments in hydraulic flumes
   to measure the critical shear stress for mass erosion tend to be lengthy
   and require large quantities of sediment. For bottom sediment from Lake
   Okeechobee at naturally occurring values of the floc volume fraction, a
   comparison of the viscoplastic yield stress, readily obtained from
   rheometry, with the mass erosion critical stress from flume tests
   indicates that it may be permissible to consider the yield stress as a
   surrogate for the critical stress. This inference appears to be
   supported by ancillary observations from Lake Apopka and Newnans Lake.
   Interestingly enough, the variation of yield stress with the floc volume
   fraction of the organic-rich bed is found to conform to fractal
   characterization commonly invoked for mineral sediment flocs, consistent
   with a representative constant value of 2.55 of the fractal dimension.
   Pending fuller investigations with a wide range of organic-rich
   sediments, recourse to rheometry in lieu of flume experiments holds
   promise as a means to simplify testing requirements for estimating the
   mass erosion critical stress. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Personalized neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) models can represent the
   neurological, physiological, and anatomical characteristics of an
   individual and can be used to estimate the forces generated inside the
   human body. Currently, publicly available software to calculate muscle
   forces are restricted to static and dynamic optimisation methods, or
   limited to isometric tasks only. We have created and made freely
   available for the research community the Calibrated EMG-Informed NMS
   Modelling Toolbox (CEINMS), an OpenSim plug-in that enables
   investigators to predict different neural control solutions for the same
   musculoskeletal geometry and measured movements. CEINMS comprises
   EMG-driven and EMG-informed algorithms that have been previously
   published and tested. It operates on dynamic skeletal models possessing
   any number of degrees of freedom and musculotendon units and can be
   calibrated to the individual to predict measured joint moments and EMG
   patterns. In this paper we describe the components of CEINMS and its
   integration with OpenSim. We then analyse how EMG-driven, EMG-assisted,
   and static optimisation neural control solutions affect the estimated
   joint moments, muscle forces, and muscle excitations, including muscle
   co-contraction. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is

Abstract = {{Hyperspectral images can be used to identify savannah tree species at
   the landscape scale, which is a key step in measuring biomass and
   carbon, and tracking changes in species distributions, including
   invasive species, in these ecosystems. Before automated species mapping
   can be performed, image processing and atmospheric correction is often
   performed, which can potentially affect the performance of
   classification algorithms. We determine how three processing and
   correction techniques (atmospheric correction, Gaussian filters, and
   shade/green vegetation filters) affect the prediction accuracy of
   classification of tree species at pixel level from airborne
   visible/infrared imaging spectrometer imagery of longleaf pine savanna
   in Central Florida, United States. Species classification using fast
   line-of-sight atmospheric analysis of spectral hypercubes (FLAASH)
   atmospheric correction outperformed ATCOR in the majority of cases.
   Green vegetation (normalized difference vegetation index) and shade
   (near-infrared) filters did not increase classification accuracy when
   applied to large and continuous patches of specific species. Finally,
   applying a Gaussian filter reduces interband noise and increases species
   classification accuracy. Using the optimal preprocessing steps, our
   classification accuracy of six species classes is about 75\%. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Migraine is the most common neurovascular disorder that imparts a
   considerable burden to health care system around the world. However,
   currently there are still no effective and widely applicable
   pharmacotherapies for migraine patients. Herbal formulae, characterized
   as multiple herbs, constituents and targets, have been acknowledged with
   clinical effects in treating migraine, which attract more and more
   researchers' attention although their exact molecular mechanisms are
   still unclear. In this work, a novel systems pharmacology-based method
   which integrates pharmacokinetic filtering, target fishing and network
   analysis was developed and exemplified by a probe, i.e. Tianshu formula,
   a widely clinically used anti-migraine herbal formula in China which
   comprises of Rhizome chuanxiong and Gastrodia elate. The results exhibit
   that 20 active ingredients of Tianshu formula possess favorable
   pharmacokinetic profiles, which have interactions with 48
   migraine-related targets to provide potential synergistic therapeutic
   effects. Additionally, from systematic analysis, we speculate that R.
   chuanxiong as the monarch herb mediates the major targets like PTGS2,
   ESR1, NOS2, HTR1B and NOS3 to regulate the vascular and nervous systems,
   as well as the inflammation and pain-related pathways to benefit
   migraine patients. Meanwhile, as an adjuvant herb, G. elate may not only
   assist the monarch herb to improve the outcome of migraine patients, but
   also regulate multiple targets like ABAT, HTR1D, ALOX15 and KCND3 to
   modify migraine accompanying symptoms like vomiting, vertigo and
   gastrointestinal disorders. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The main objective of this study is to investigate the characteristics
   of woody biomass conversion to syngas using a steam allothermal
   gasification process. The entering steam maintained at 877 degrees C and
   1000 degrees C, respectively was used as the gasifying agent. A lab
   scale apparatus was built to perform the gasification experiment and the
   produced syngas was accurately analyzed using gas chromatography. The
   results clearly indicate that the syngas from steam gasification
   contains relatively higher H-2 concentrations, and the heating values of
   the syngas reach 9-10 MJ/m(3). A thermodynamic equilibrium
   thermochemical model that accounts for the deposition of solid carbon as
   a function of the entering steam temperature and the steam to biomass
   molar ratio was developed. The model was successfully verified by
   experimental results. Based on the results of model, an optimal range of
   the steam to biomass molar ratio is recommended. Copyright (C) 2015,

Abstract = {{Sorghum {[}Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] is the fifth most important
   grain crop globally. It stands out for its diversity of plant types,
   end-uses, and roles in cropping systems. This diversity presents
   opportunities but also complicates evaluation of production options,
   especially under climate uncertainty. Ecophysiological models can
   dissect interacting effects of plant genotypes, crop management, and
   environment. We describe the sorghum module of the Cropping System Model
   (CSM) as implemented in the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology
   Transfer (DSSAT) to illustrate potential applications and suggest areas
   for model improvement. Crop growth is simulated based on radiation use
   efficiency. Development responds to temperature and photoperiod.
   Partitioning rules vary with growth stages, respecting mass balance and
   maintaining functional equilibrium between roots and shoots. Routines
   for climate, soil, crop management, and model controls are shared with
   other crops in CSM. Modeled responses for eight real-world and
   hypothetical cases are presented. These include growth under
   well-managed conditions, responses to row-spacing, population, sowing
   date, irrigation, defoliation, and increased atmospheric carbon dioxide
   concentration ({[}CO2]), and a long-term sorghum and winter wheat
   (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation. Among traits and experiments
   considered, model accuracy was high for phenology (r(2) = 0.96, P < 0.01
   for anthesis and r(2) = 0.91, P < 0.01 for maturity), moderate for grain
   yields (r(2) values from 0.30 to 0.52, P < 0.01), depending on the
   simulated experiments, and low for unit grain weight (r(2) = 0.02, not
   significant, NS) and leaf area index for forage sorghum (r(2) = 0.18,
   NS).}},

Title = {{Genetic Improvement of Peanut Cultivars for West Africa Evaluated with

Abstract = {{Crop models are valuable tools for evaluating past genetic improvement
   as well as guiding future breeding strategies for target regions. The
   objective of this study was to use the CSM-CROPGRO-Peanut model to
   evaluate traits responsible for genetic improvement of peanut (Arachis
   hypogaea L.) genotypes grown in West Africa. Data on 19 cultivars were
   obtained from performance trials in 2010 and 2011 at two sites in Ghana
   and two sites in Burkina Faso. For all sites and years, pod yield, seed
   yield, shelling percentage, and seed size were determined at harvest,
   and leaf spot disease was recorded. Time-series data on crop biomass,
   pod mass, and pod harvest index were measured at two Ghana sites in 2
   yr. Data on phenology, e.g., first flower, first pod, and harvest
   maturity were observed at one site in Ghana in 2010. Optimization and
   calibration procedures were used with the CROPGRO-Peanut model to
   estimate cultivar coefficients from the data. The derived cultivar
   coefficients simulated pod yields that agreed well with observed pod
   yields. Solved cultivar coefficients varied considerably among
   cultivars. With the derived cultivar coefficients, the CROPGRO-Peanut
   model was able to simulate much of the genetic variation in pod yield
   among the 19 cultivars within eight site-year combinations (d statistic
   of 0.90 and RMSE of 299 kg ha(-1)). The derived cultivar coefficients
   illustrated that yield improvement leading to nearly twofold higher pod
   yield resulted from a combination of improved partitioning (leading to
   higher pod harvest index), higher photosynthesis, longer life cycle,
   longer seed-filling duration, and improved leaf spot resistance.}},

   three fundamental colors red, green, and blue (21\% EQE, 82 cd/A for
   green). This is the first report of a green QLED with EQE >20\% and
   current efficiency >80 cd/A. The devices have the longest lifetimes
   reported in the literature (280k hrs) and extremely well-tuned color
   fidelity. The narrow QLED emission spectra (full width at half maximum
   <30 nm) and well-controlled peak wavelengths generate a color gamut
   covering >170\% of the National Television System Committee (NTSC) 1987
   color space and similar to 90\% of the Rec. 2020 color space. This color
   gamut is larger than that of OLED televisions in mass production and is
   the largest of all QLEDs reported. Additionally, these devices are
   completely fabricated using solution-processing techniques. The
   extremely desirable properties of high efficiency, color
   tunability/fidelity, long lifetime, and low cost processing from

Abstract = {{The 3-D hydrodynamics of storm surge events, including the effects of
   vegetation and impact on onshore transport of marine sediment, have
   important consequences for coastal communities. Here, complex storm
   surge dynamics during Hurricane Ike are investigated using a
   three-dimensional (3-D), vegetation-resolving storm surge-wave model
   (CH3D-SWAN) which includes such effects of vegetation as profile drag,
   skin friction, and production, dissipation, and transport of turbulence.
   This vegetation-resolving 3-D model features a turbulent kinetic energy
   (TKE) closure model, which uses momentum equations with
   vegetation-induced profile and skin friction drags, a dynamic q(2)
   equation including turbulence production and dissipation by vegetation,
   as well as vegetation-dependent algebraic length-scale equations, and a
   Smagorinsky-type horizontal turbulence model. This vegetation model has
   been verified using extensive laboratory tests, but this study is a
   comparison of 2-D and 3-D simulations of complex storm surge dynamics
   during Hurricane Ike. We examine the value of 3-D storm surge models
   relative to 2-D models for simulating coastal currents, effects of
   vegetation on surge, and sediment transport during storm events.
   Comparisons are made between results obtained using simple 2-D
   formulations for bottom friction, the Manning coefficient (MC) approach,
   and physics-based 3-D vegetation-modeling (VM) approach. Last, the role
   that the 3-D hydrodynamics on onshore transport and deposition of marine
   sediments during the storm is investigated. While both the 3-D and 2-D
   results simulated the water level dynamics, results of the physics-based
   3-D VM approach, as compared to the 2-D MC approach, more accurately
   captures the complex storm surge dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{A drag-free spacecraft uses a gravitational reference sensor to shield
   an internal free-floating test mass from all external disturbances and
   disturbances caused by the spacecraft itself. Since the test mass is
   completely freed from nongravitational disturbances, it and its tender
   spacecraft follow a pure geodesic. The next generation of drag-free
   space systems will provide autonomous precision orbit determination,
   more accurately map the static and time-varying components of the
   Earth's mass distribution, aid in the understanding of the fundamental
   force of gravity, and ultimately open up a new window to the universe
   through the detection and observation of gravitational waves. In this
   paper, a simple and cost-effective design for a drag-free nanosatellite
   for autonomous Earth observation and in situ atmospheric studies is
   explored. The nanosatellite is composed of a single thruster to
   compensate for drag and an attitude control system to orient the
   satellite in the direction of the external disturbance. The stability of
   the spacecraft and its ability to recover the external disturbance force
   vector are demonstrated on a flight-ready nanosatellite processor
   interfaced with a personal computer, modeling the spacecraft dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power have a high degree
   of unpredictability and time-variation, which makes balancing demand and
   supply challenging. One possible way to address this challenge is to
   harness the inherent flexibility in demand of many types of loads.
   Introduced in this paper is a technique for decentralized control for
   automated demand response that can be used by grid operators as
   ancillary service for maintaining demand-supply balance. A randomized
   control architecture is proposed, motivated by the need for
   decentralized decision making, and the need to avoid synchronization
   that can lead to large and detrimental spikes in demand. An aggregate
   model for a large number of loads is then developed by examining the
   mean field limit. A key innovation is a linear time-invariant (LTI)
   system approximation of the aggregate nonlinear model, with a scalar
   signal as the input and a measure of the aggregate demand as the output.
   This makes the approximation particularly convenient for control design
   at the grid level.}},

Title = {{Theta-rhythmic drive between medial septum and hippocampus in slow-wave
   sleep and microarousal: a Granger causality analysis}},

Abstract = {{Medial septum (MS) plays a critical role in controlling the electrical
   activity of the hippocampus (HIPP). In particular, theta-rhythmic burst
   firing of MS neurons is thought to drive lasting HIPP theta oscillations
   in rats during waking motor activity and REM sleep. Less is known about
   MS-HIPP interactions in nontheta states such as non-REM sleep, in which
   HIPP theta oscillations are absent but theta-rhythmic burst firing in
   subsets of MS neurons is preserved. The present study used Granger
   causality (GC) to examine the interaction patterns between MS and HIPP
   in slow-wave sleep (SWS, a nontheta state) and during its short
   interruptions called microarousals (a transient theta state). We found
   that during SWS, while GC revealed a unidirectional MS -> HIPP influence
   over a wide frequency band (2-12 Hz, maximum: similar to 8 Hz), there
   was no theta peak in the hippocampal power spectra, indicating a lack of
   theta activity in HIPP. In contrast, during microarousals, theta peaks
   were seen in both MS and HIPP power spectra and were accompanied by
   bidirectional GC with MS -> HIPP and HIPP -> MS theta drives being of
   equal magnitude. Thus GC in a nontheta state (SWS) vs. a theta state
   (microarousal) primarily differed in the level of HIPP -> MS. The
   present findings suggest a modification of our understanding of the role
   of MS as the theta generator in two regards. First, a MS -> HIPP theta
   drive does not necessarily induce theta field oscillations in the
   hippocampus, as found in SWS. Second, HIPP theta oscillations entail
   bidirectional theta-rhythmic interactions between MS and HIPP.}},

Abstract = {{It is well-established that during goal-directed motor tasks, patients
   with essential tremor have increased oscillations in the 0-3 and 3-8 Hz
   bands. It remains unclear if these increased oscillations relate to
   activity in specific brain regions. This study used task-based
   functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare the brain activity
   associated with oscillations in grip force output between patients with
   essential tremor, patients with Parkinson's disease who had clinically
   evident tremor, and healthy controls. The findings demonstrate that
   patients with essential tremor have increased brain activity in the
   motor cortex and supplementary motor area compared with controls, and
   this activity correlated positively with 3-8 Hz force oscillations.
   Brain activity in cerebellar lobules I-V was reduced in essential tremor
   compared with controls and correlated negatively with 0-3 Hz force
   oscillations. Widespread differences in brain activity were observed
   between essential tremor and Parkinson's disease. Using functional
   connectivity analyses during the task evidenced reduced
   cerebellar-cortical functional connectivity in patients with essential
   tremor compared with controls and Parkinson's disease. This study
   provides new evidence that in essential tremor 3-8 Hz force oscillations
   relate to hyperactivity in motor cortex, 0-3 Hz force oscillations
   relate to the hypoactivity in the cerebellum, and cerebellar-cortical
   functional connectivity is impaired.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of `successful aging' has long intrigued the scientific
   community. Despite this long-standing interest, a consensus definition
   has proven to be a difficult task, due to the inherent challenge
   involved in defining such a complex, multi-dimensional phenomenon. The
   lack of a clear set of defining characteristics for the construct of
   successful aging has made comparison of findings across studies
   difficult and has limited advances in aging research. A consensus on
   markers of successful aging is furthest developed is the domain of
   physical functioning. For example, walking speed appears to be an
   excellent surrogate marker of overall health and predicts the
   maintenance of physical independence, a cornerstone of successful aging.
   The purpose of the present article is to provide an overview and
   discussion of specific health conditions, behavioral factors, and
   biological mechanisms that mark declining mobility and physical function
   and promising interventions to counter these effects. With life
   expectancy continuing to increase in the United States and developed
   countries throughout the world, there is an increasing public health
   focus on the maintenance of physical independence among all older
   adults. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{About 70\% of eyedrops contain benzalkonium chloride (BAR) as a
   preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. While
   preservatives are mandated to maintain sterility, many patients exhibit
   irritation and toxicity to such compounds. We propose to mitigate the
   ocular toxicity in the ocular formulations without compromising
   sterility by designing a device that can be incorporated into an
   eyedrops bottle to selectively remove the preservatives during the
   process of drop instillation. Here, we specifically focus on macroporous
   poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA) gel due to its excellent
   biocompatibility and high partition coefficient for BAR. In addition to
   specific selectivity for BAR, the device also requires high hydraulic
   permeability to allow drop dispensing without excessive pressure drop.
   The pHEMA monolith can remove nearly 100\% of contained BAR from a 25
   ml, 0.012\% BAR solution with negligible uptake of the hydrophilic drugs
   such as timolol and dorzolamide. The filter, however, had to be
   pre-equilibrated with hydrophobic drugs to reach a high separation of
   BAR without reducing the concentration of the active drug. The average
   hydraulic permeability of the filter was 0.025 Darcy, which is about
   5-fold lower than the ideal value. Incorporation of a pHEMA macroporous
   gel into an eyedrops bottle can virtually eliminate the exposure of the
   eyes to the preservatives without compromising the sterility. Our novel
   design can eliminate the preservative induced toxicity from eyedrops
   thereby impacting hundreds of millions of patients with chronic
   ophthalmic diseases such as glaucoma and dry eyes. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper examines the effectiveness of variable speed limits (VSLs) on
   improving traffic flow efficiency and reducing vehicular emissions in a
   stylized setting of morning commute where a fixed number of individuals
   commute from home to work through the freeway with a single recurrent
   bottleneck. The mechanism of interest is for a VSL system to prevent the
   bottleneck from being activated and thus avoid detrimental capacity drop
   that arises at the activated bottleneck. We firstly consider a VSL
   system installed along the freeway towards the bottleneck, which adjusts
   commuters' cruising speeds in a continuous fashion and essentially
   regulates the upstream flow into the bottleneck. By investigating the
   resulting departure-time equilibrium of commuters, we find the VSL
   system can eliminate the efficiency loss caused by capacity drop, and
   further bound its improvements on various performance measures. We then
   turn to a more practical VSL system, which adjusts commuters' cruising
   speeds in a discrete fashion. The conditions for such a system to
   improve various performance measures are established and its
   efficiencies are bounded. Based on empirical data, we conclude that the
   discrete VSL system can avoid or delay capacity drop associated with an
   active bottleneck and thus reduce queuing delay. It can help reduce the
   schedule delay cost and total emissions cost. However, it is unlikely
   for the system to reduce total travel time, individual travel cost and
   social cost in this particular setting. These results shed light on the
   effectiveness of VSL systems on realistic freeway networks. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{This paper studies the optimal multi-step toll design problem for the
   bottleneck model with general user heterogeneity. The design model is
   formulated as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints
   (MPEC), which is NP-hard due to non-convexity in both the objective
   function and the feasible set. An analytical method is proposed to solve
   the MPEC by decomposing it into smaller and easier quadratic programs,
   each corresponding to a unique departure order of different user
   classes. The quadratic programs are defined on a polyhedral set, which
   makes it easier to identify a local optimum. Importantly, each quadratic
   program is constrained by a set of linear feasibility cuts that define
   the presence of each user class in the arrival window. We prove that the
   proposed method ensures global optimality provided that each quadratic
   program can be solved globally. To obviate enumerating all departure
   orders, a heuristic method is developed to navigate through the solution
   space by using the multipliers associated with the feasibility cuts.
   Numerical experiments are conducted on several small examples to
   validate the proposed methodology. These experiments show that the
   proposed heuristic method is effective in finding near-optimal solutions
   within a relatively small number of iterations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{InGaZnO4 (IGZO) is attracting interest for transparent thin film
   transistors because of its excellent transport properties even in
   amorphous films deposited at low temperatures. The basic parameters of
   potential gate dielectric materials for IGZO is still lacking in many
   cases. The authors have measured the band offsets of sputtered HfSiO4 on
   IGZO using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and obtained the bandgaps of
   the materials using reflection electron energy loss spectroscopy. The
   effect of atmospheric exposure on the band offsets was systematically
   examined. Previous work has shown that both HfO2 and SiO2 have nested
   type I alignments on IGZO. However, the HfSiO4/IGZO system has a
   staggered, type II alignment, with a valence band offset of -0.43 +/-
   0.04 eV for samples in which all the layers were kept in vacuum or -0.27
   +/- 0.03 eV for samples exposed to atmosphere prior to the measurement.
   The conduction band offset for HfSiO4/IGZO was derived as 3.07 +/- 0.31
   eV for the vacuum samples from the measured bandgap of the IGZO (3.16
   eV) and 3.01 +/- 0.30 eV for vented samples. (C) 2015 American Vacuum

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Neuroplasticity is key to the operation of brain machine interfaces
   (BMIs) a direct communication pathway between the brain and a man-made
   computing device. Whereas exogenous BMIs that associate volitional
   control of brain activity with neurofeedback have been shown to induce
   long lasting plasticity, endogenous BMIs that use prolonged
   activity-dependent stimulation- and thus may curtail the time scale that
   governs natural sensorimotor integration loops-have been shown to induce
   short lasting plasticity. Here we summarize recent findings from studies
   using both categories of BMIs, and discuss the fundamental principles
   that may underlie their operation and the longevity of the plasticity
   they induce. We draw comparison to plasticity mechanisms known to
   mediate natural sensorimotor skill learning and discuss principles of
   homeostatic regulation that may constrain endogenous BMI effects in the
   adult mammalian brain. We propose that BMIs could be designed to
   facilitate structural and functional plasticity for the purpose of

Title = {{Far-field momentum flux of high-frequency axisymmetric synthetic jets}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This study focuses on predicting the far-field momentum flux for
   axisymmetric synthetic jets, which is an important parameter that
   characterizes the performance of such jets in flow-control applications.
   Previous researchers have found that a negative pressure gradient near
   the jet orifice is responsible for the observed decrease in the momentum
   flux in the streamwise direction. As a result, prediction of the far
   field momentum flux of synthetic jets has encountered serious
   challenges. In this paper, the far-field momentum flux is modeled by
   calculating the hydrodynamic impulse of the vortical structure formed
   during one actuation cycle, under the assumption that the jet is fully
   developed and periodic. In this manner, the complex near-field effect of
   a synthetic jet is explicitly captured by the interactions between the
   vortices and the actuator. Furthermore, the impulse of these vortical
   structures is predicted using only the actuation parameters of the
   synthetic jet, namely, the stroke length, L, the orifice diameter, d,
   and the actuation frequency, f. For a synthetic jet with a stroke ratio,
   L/d, larger than the formation number, L{*}/d, this model predicts that
   the normalized far-field momentum flux, K/K-s, decreases when L/d
   increases. This can be explained by an increasing circulation fraction
   of the trailing jet, which contains less impulse per unit circulation
   compared with the leading vortex. This model is validated using hot-wire
   anemometry measurement of a series of synthetic jets. Moreover, by
   comparing with experimental data that have large L/d, this model
   suggests that the contribution of trailing jet to the overall far-field
   momentum flux is not negligible. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning (VRFT) is a data-driven one-shot
   control method which is very attractive for engineering applications.
   However, it cannot design controllers with the optimal control
   performance based on the standard VRFT approach as performance indices
   are not explicitly represented in its objective function. To deal with
   this problem, this paper presents a novel intelligent VRFT (IVRFT) based
   on adaptive binary ant system harmony search (ABASHS) where the
   reference model of VRFT, which potentially determines the control
   performance, is coordinately optimized with the controller by ABASHS to
   achieve the best control performance. Finally, the proposed ABASHS-based
   intelligent virtual reference feedback tuning (ABASHS-IVRFT) method is
   applied to the temperature control of the heat treatment electric
   furnace. The simulation results demonstrate that ABASHS-IVRFT is valid
   and can implement the optimal non-overshoot control easily and
   efficiently. Considering the characteristics such as ease of
   implementation and no need of the model information of controlled
   objects, ABASHS-IVRFT is a promising approach for engineering
   applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{783}},
Pages = {{344-378}},

Abstract = {{The present work reports some new aspects of axisymmetric gravity
   currents obtained from laboratory experiments, fully resolved
   simulations and box models. Following the earlier work of Zgheib et al.
   (Theoi Compd. Fluid Dyn., vol. 28, 2014, pp. 521-529) which demonstrated
   that gravity currents initiating from non-axisymmetric cross-sectional
   geometries do not become axisymmetric, nor do they retain their initial
   shape during the slumping and inertial phases of spreading, we show that
   such non-axisymmetric currents eventually reach a self-similar regime
   during which (i) the local front propagation scales as t(1/2) as in
   circular releases and (ii) the non-axisymmetric front has a self-similar
   shape that primarily depends on the aspect ratio of the initial release.
   Complementary experiments of non-Boussinesq currents and top-spreading
   currents suggest that this self-similar dynamics is independent of the
   density ratio, vertical aspect ratio, wall friction and Reynolds number
   Re, provided the last is large, i.e. Re >= O(10(4)). The local
   instantaneous front Froude number obtained from the fully resolved
   simulations is compared to existing models of Froude functions. The
   recently reported extended box model is capable of capturing the
   dynamics of such non-axisymmetric flows. Here we use the extended box
   model to propose a relation for the self-similar horizontal aspect ratio
   chi(infinity) of the propagating front as a function of the initial
   horizontal aspect ratio chi(0), namely chi(infinity) = 1 + (In chi(0))/3
   The experimental and numerical results are in good agreement with the
   proposed relation}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores how to optimally locate public charging stations for
   electric vehicles on a road network, considering drivers' spontaneous
   adjustments and interactions of travel and recharging decisions. The
   proposed approach captures the interdependency of different trips
   conducted by the same driver by examining the complete tour of the
   driver. Given the limited driving range and recharging needs of battery
   electric vehicles, drivers of electric vehicles are assumed to
   simultaneously determine tour paths and recharging plans to minimize
   their travel and recharging time while guaranteeing not running out of
   charge before completing their tours. Moreover, different initial states
   of charge of batteries and risk-taking attitudes of drivers toward the
   uncertainty of energy consumption are considered. The resulting
   multi-class network equilibrium flow pattern is described by a
   mathematical program, which is solved by an iterative procedure. Based
   on the proposed equilibrium framework, the charging station location
   problem is then formulated as a bi-level mathematical program and solved
   by a genetic-algorithm-based procedure. Numerical examples are presented
   to demonstrate the models and provide insights on public charging
   infrastructure deployment and behaviors of electric vehicles. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) has been shown to impart a

   NMES-induced fatigue compared to conventional single-channel
   stimulation. However, in previous studies in man, the effect of
   stimulation frequency on the NMES-induced fatigue has not been examined
   for asynchronous stimulation. Low stimulation frequencies are known to
   reduce fatigue during conventional stimulation. Therefore, the aim of
   this study was to examine the fatigue characteristics of high-and
   low-frequency asynchronous stimulation as well as high-and low-frequency
   conventional stimulation. Experiments were performed in both able-bodied
   and spinal cord injured populations. Low frequency asynchronous
   stimulation is found to have significant fatigue benefits over high

Abstract = {{Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is commonly used in
   rehabilitative settings and is also used for assistive purposes to
   create functional movements, where it is termed functional electrical
   stimulation (FES). One limitation of NMES/FES is early onset of muscle
   fatigue. NMES-induced fatigue can be reduced by switching between
   multiple stimulation channels that target different motor units or
   synergistic muscles (i.e., asynchronous stimulation). However, switching
   stimulation channels introduces additional complexity due to the need to
   consider the switching dynamics and differing muscle response to
   stimulation. The objective of this study was to develop and test a
   closed-loop controller for asynchronous stimulation. The developed
   closed-loop controller yields asymptotic tracking of a desired
   trajectory for a person's knee-shank complex despite switching between
   stimulation channels. The developed controller was implemented on four
   able-bodied individuals with four-channel asynchronous stimulation as
   well as single-channel conventional stimulation. The results indicate
   that asynchronous stimulation extends the duration that functional
   movements can be performed during feedback control. This result is
   promising for the implementation of asynchronous stimulation in
   closed-loop rehabilitative procedures and in assistive devices as a
   method to reduce muscle fatigue while maintaining a person's ability to
   track a desired limb trajectory.}},

Abstract = {{To enable the life extension of Light Water Reactors (LWRs) beyond 60
   years, it is critical to gain adequate knowledge for making conclusive
   predictions to assure the integrity of duplex stainless steel reactor
   components, e.g. primary pressure boundary and reactor vessel internal.
   Microstructural changes in the ferrite of thermally aged, neutron
   irradiated only, and neutron irradiated after being thermally aged cast
   austenitic stainless steels (CASS) were investigated using atom probe
   tomography. The thermal aging was performed at 400 degrees C for 10,000
   h and the irradiation was conducted in the Halden reactor at 315 degrees
   C to 0.08 dpa (5.6 x 10(19) n/cm(2), E > 1 MeV). Low dose neutron
   irradiation at a dose rate of 5 x 10(-9) dpa/s was found to induce
   spinodal decomposition in the ferrite of as-cast microstructure, and
   further to enhance the spinodal decomposition in the thermally aged cast
   alloys. Regarding the G-phase precipitates, the neutron irradiation
   dramatically increases the precipitate size, and alters the composition
   of the precipitates with increased, Mn, Ni, Si and Mo and reduced Fe and
   Cr contents. The results have shown that low dose neutron irradiation
   can further accelerate the degradation of ferrite in a duplex stainless
   steel at the LWR relevant condition. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Road construction demonstrably accelerates deforestation rates in
   tropical forests, but its consequences for forest degradation remain
   less clear. We estimated a series of forest value metrics including
   components of biodiversity, carbon stocks, and timber and non-timber
   forest product resources, along the recently paved Inter-Oceanic Highway
   (IOH) integrating Brazil and Peru along the Bolivian border. We
   installed 69 vegetation plots in intact terra firme forests
   representative of local community holdings near and far from the IOH,
   and we characterized 15 components of forest value for each plot.
   We observed strong geographic gradients in forest value components
   across the region, with increases from west to east in aboveground
   biomass and in the abundance of timber and non-timber forest product
   trees and regeneration. Plots in communities in Pando, Bolivia, where
   the IOH remains in part unpaved, had the highest aboveground biomass,
   standing timber volumes and Brazil nut tree density. In contrast,
   communities in Madre de Dios, Peru, where settlements and unpaved
   portions of the IOH have existed for decades, and in Acre, Brazil, where
   paving of the IOH has been underway for more than a decade, were more
   degraded. Seven of the fifteen forest value components we measured
   increased with increasing distance from the IOH, although the magnitude
   of these effects was weak. Landscape scale remote sensing analyses
   showed much stronger effects of road proximity on deforestation. We
   suggest that remote sensing techniques including canopy spectral
   signatures might be calibrated to characterize multiple components of
   forest value, so that we can estimate landscape scale-impacts of
   infrastructure developments on both deforestation and forest degradation
   in tropical regions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Perovskite oxides have recently been proposed as promising redox
   intermediates for solar thermochemical splitting of H2O and CO2,
   offering the benefit of significantly reduced operating temperatures. We
   present a systematic experimental screening of doped lanthanum
   manganites within the composition space La1-x(Ca,Sr)(x)Mn1-yAlyO3 and
   identify several promising redox materials. In particular,
   La0.6Sr0.4Mn0.6Al0.4O3 and La0.6Ca0.4Mn0.6Al0.4O3 boast a five- to
   thirteen-fold improvement in the reduction extent compared to the
   state-of-the-art material CeO2 in the temperature range 1200-1400
   degrees C. The materials are shown to be capable of splitting CO2 into
   CO fuel when isothermally cycled between low-pO(2) and high-pCO(2)
   environments at 1240 degrees C and to approach full reoxidation in CO2
   with temperature swings as low as 200 degrees C, with mass-specific fuel
   yields up to tentimes that of CeO2. The underlying material
   thermodynamics are investigated and used to explain the favorable redox
   behavior.}},

Title = {{Experimental Characterization and Modeling of the Anisotropy and

   Rates Ranging from Quasi-static to Impact}},

Abstract = {{A systematic experimental investigation of the room-temperature
   quasi-static behavior and dynamic mechanical response of polycrystalline
   commercially pure molybdenum is presented. It was established that the
   material has ductility in tension at 10(-5)/s and that the failure
   strain is strongly dependent on the orientation. A specimen taken along
   the rolling direction (RD) sustains large axial strains (20\%), while a
   specimen taken at an angle of 45A degrees to the RD could only sustain
   5\% strain. It was observed that irrespective of the loading orientation
   the yield stress in uniaxial compression is larger than in uniaxial
   tension. While in tension, the material has a strong anisotropy in
   Lankford coefficients, while in uniaxial compression, it displays weak
   strain-anisotropy. Due to the material's limited tensile ductility,
   successfully acquiring data for impact conditions is very challenging.
   For the first time, Taylor impact tests were successfully conducted on
   this material for impact velocities in the range 140-165 m/s. For impact
   velocities beyond this range, the very high tensile pressures generated
   in the specimen immediately after impact lead to failure. An
   elastic-plastic anisotropic model that accounts for all the
   specificities of the plastic deformation of the material was developed.
   Validation of the model was done through comparison with data on
   quasi-static notched specimens and Taylor impact specimens. Quantitative
   agreement with both global and local strain fields was obtained. In
   particular, the effect of loading orientation on the response was very
   well described for all strain rates.}},

Abstract = {{The extrusion die is one of the most important parts in extrusion
   processing. It is difficult to design and manufacture to the land length
   of the die for polypropylene single-lumen micro tubes. In the paper, the
   land length was designed by rheological properties of polypropylene. For
   single-lumen micro tubes, the land length with a small air hole was so
   small that it was easily to be broken, especially in the processing.
   Therefore, the land length was manufactured by micro-EDM. Then, the
   experimental results showed that the designed and manufactured die was
   reasonable and could meet the using requirements. According to the
   further extrusion experiments, the relationships between tube sizes and
   extrusion processing parameters were explored. The results indicated
   that the die temperature had little effect on the tube sizes. That was
   because the increasing temperature reduced the viscosity and the
   pressure drop in the die simultaneously. With the given temperature and
   the constant screw speed, the macromolecules of the polymers with the
   increasing pulling speeds were straightened to the limit and slipped
   among the macromolecules, which caused the diameters and wall
   thicknesses of the micro tubes to decrease in the nonlinear curves.
   Meanwhile, in the given temperature and the constant pulling speed, the
   higher the screw speeds got, because of the shear thinning, the smaller
   the shear viscosity was. However, the increasing amplitudes of the
   pressure in the die were getting small. So the volume flow rates were
   also reduced accordingly. Thus the change rates of the diameters and
   wall thicknesses were also getting small. In the other word, the
   relations between the micro tube sizes and the screw speeds were not
   linear, but nonlinear. These results were very valuable for the
   extrusion die designs of multi-lumen micro tubes and the extrusion
   processing.}},

   large-scale climate impact simulations with agricultural and other
   models, leveraging high-performance and cloud computing; and
   post-processing to produce aggregated yields and ensemble variables
   needed for statistics, for model intercomparison, and to connect
   biophysical models to global and regional economic models. FACE-IT
   leverages the capabilities of the Globus Galaxies platform to enable the
   capture of workflows and outputs in well-defined, reusable, and

Abstract = {{The lack of a functional endothelium on small-diameter vascular grafts
   leads to intimal hyperplasia and thrombotic occlusion. Shear stress
   conditioning through controlled hydrodynamics within in vitro perfusion
   bioreactors has shown promise as a mechanism to drive endothelial cell
   (EC) phenotype from an activated, pro-inflammatory wound state toward a
   quiescent functional state that inhibits responses that lead to
   occlusive failure. As part of an overall design strategy to engineer
   functional vascular grafts, we present a novel two-phase shear
   conditioning approach to improve graft endothelialization. Axial
   rotation was first used to seed uniform EC monolayers onto the lumenal
   surface of decellularized scaffolds derived from the human umbilical
   vein. Using computer-controlled perfusion circuits, a flow-ramping
   paradigm was applied to adapt endothelia to arterial levels of fluid
   shear stress and pressure without graft denudation. The effects of
   constant pulse frequencies (CF) on EC quiescence were then compared with
   pulse frequencies modeled from temporal fluctuations in blood flow
   observed in vivo, termed physiologically modeled pulse dynamics (PMPD).
   Constructs exposed to PMPD for 72h expressed a more functional
   transcriptional profile, lower metabolic activity (39.8\%+/- 8.4\% vs.
   62.5\%+/- 11.5\% reduction, p=0.012), and higher nitric oxide production
   (80.42 +/- 23.93 vs. 48.75 +/- 6.93nmol/10(5) cells, p=0.028) than those
   exposed to CF. By manipulating in vitro flow conditions to mimic natural
   physiology, endothelialized vascular grafts can be stimulated to express
   a nonactivated phenotype that would better inhibit peripheral cell
   adhesion and smooth muscle cell hyperplasia, conditions that typically
   lead to occlusive failure. Development of robust, functional endothelia
   on vascular grafts by modulation of environmental conditions within
   perfusion bioreactors may ultimately improve clinical outcomes in
   vascular bypass grafting.}},

   methods for neurosurgery. The purpose of this empirical study was to
   evaluate different tractography techniques in the first DTI Challenge
   workshop.
   METHODSEight international teams from leading institutions reconstructed
   the pyramidal tract in four neurosurgical cases presenting with a glioma
   near the motor cortex. Tractography methods included deterministic,
   probabilistic, filtered, and global approaches. Standardized evaluation
   of the tracts consisted in the qualitative review of the pyramidal
   pathways by a panel of neurosurgeons and DTI experts and the
   quantitative evaluation of the degree of agreement among methods.
   RESULTSThe evaluation of tractography reconstructions showed a great
   interalgorithm variability. Although most methods found projections of
   the pyramidal tract from the medial portion of the motor strip, only a
   few algorithms could trace the lateral projections from the hand, face,
   and tongue area. In addition, the structure of disagreement among
   methods was similar across hemispheres despite the anatomical
   distortions caused by pathological tissues.
   CONCLUSIONSThe DTI Challenge provides a benchmark for the standardized
   evaluation of tractography methods on neurosurgical data. This study
   suggests that there are still limitations to the clinical use of
   tractography for neurosurgical decision making.}},

   establish its basic properties, among which are a characterization of
   the set of all optimal solutions, the uniqueness of an optimal solution,
   and extremal values of the tolerance function on an optimal solution.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Alteration in shoulder kinematics has been suggested as one
   cause of symptoms in shoulders with rotator cuff tears (RCTs). However,
   only a few studies comparing symptomatic and asymptomatic RCTs using
   kinematic analysis have been performed. The purpose of this study was to
   compare 3-dimensional (3D) scapular and glenohumeral kinematics during
   scapular-plane abduction among symptomatic RCTs, asymptomatic RCTs, and
   healthy shoulders.
   Methods: This study included 7 healthy shoulders in subjects with a mean
   age of 62 years, 5 symptomatic RCTs in subjects with a mean age of 70
   years, and 7 asymptomatic RCTs in subjects with a mean age of 67 years.
   All shoulders with RCTs had medium-sized tears (1-3 cm in the coronal
   plane) that were confirmed with magnetic resonance imaging. Biplane
   fluoroscopic images during scapular-plane abduction were recorded, and
   computed tomography-derived 3D bone models were matched with the
   silhouettes of the bones on the fluoroscopic images using
   3D/2-dimensional model-image registration techniques. Angular values of
   the scapula and glenohumeral kinematics were compared among the 3
   groups.
   Results: Posterior tilt of the scapula was significantly smaller in the
   symptomatic RCTs (3.1 degrees +/- 1.8 degrees) than in healthy shoulders
   (10.4 degrees +/- 0.8 degrees) (P = .049). The humerus of the
   symptomatic shoulders was less externally rotated relative to the
   scapula throughout the activity than the healthy shoulders and
   asymptomatic RCTs (P = .006 and P = .028 respectively). However, there
   were no kinematic differences between the asymptomatic RCTs and healthy
   shoulders.
   Conclusion: Kinematic changes in symptomatic RCTs might be associated
   with development of symptoms. Improvement of these kinematic changes may
   be a key to successful conservative treatment for symptomatic RCTs. (C)

Abstract = {{The sensitivity of wave-mud interaction on directionality and
   nonlinearity is investigated. A phase-resolving nonlinear wave model
   which accounts for directional wave propagation and mud damping is used
   to simulate wave propagation over a muddy shelf. Field data from an
   experiment conducted at the central chenier plain coast, western
   Louisiana, USA are used to validate the model. Recently, verification of
   a one-dimensional wave model with the field data showed that this model
   was able to replicate the evolution of wave spectra over muddy bottoms.
   In this study, unidirectional wave spectra were also run through the
   parabolic model, but with various initial angles. Linear wave model runs
   were also performed in order to gauge the effect of nonlinear evolution
   on the results. Significant wave height and total energy contained in
   three different spectral bands from the model are compared to the data
   over the shelf, and correlation metrics calculated. While the model
   generally performs well no matter the initial angle, at no point does a
   zero initial angle compare best to the data, indicating that a
   unidirectional model may be missing some of the dynamical features of
   wave propagation over a muddy shelf. Furthermore, despite similar
   correlation scores between linear and nonlinear model comparisons of
   bulk statistics, it is seen the linear model does not replicate some
   aspects of the spectral evolution (such as low-frequency generation and
   amplification) shown in the data and captured by the nonlinear model.
   Despite the relatively short propagation distance, the effects of both
   directionality and nonlinearity play a noticeable role in wave evolution
   over a muddy seabed.}},

Abstract = {{Bend-twist coupling is a property of certain specially designed
   composite beams that when subjected to loading conditions that would
   normally result in pure bending, undergo both bending and twisting. This
   phenomenon is called bend-twist coupling. To fully characterize the
   degree of bend-twist coupling in the beam, shear center per unit length
   (e(y)/L) must be determined. This paper proposes an experimental method
   for quantifying e(y) /L. The specific method for manufacturing these
   composite shafts is detailed. A special apparatus was constructed to
   load the tip of a cantilever sample with an adjustable torque. Digital
   image correlation (DIC) was used to measure tip rotation and deflection.
   From these measurements shear center values were determined. Repeating
   this process for different shaft lengths and orientations allows for a
   final e(y) /L measurement. Techniques are provided to reduce the various
   uncertainties in these measurements. The experiment utilizes three
   dimensional DIC, a rigid boundary condition such as a vice to simulate a
   cantilever condition, and an adjustable moment arm on which to load the
   specimen. The special case of a cylindrical carbon fiber beam is
   presented here, but the experimental methods can be generalized to
   tapered beams, non-circular cross-sections, and other orthotropic
   materials. The results are compared against finite element and
   analytical predictions. The final average experimental e(y) /L for all
   four shafts is 8 \% higher than what the analytical method and FEA
   predict.}},

Abstract = {{Graphics processing units (GPU), due to their massive computational
   power with up to thousands of concurrent threads and general-purpose GPU
   (GPGPU) programming models such as CUDA and OpenCL, have opened up new
   opportunities for speeding up general-purpose parallel applications.
   Unfortunately, pre-silicon architectural simulation of modern-day GPGPU
   architectures and workloads is extremely time-consuming. This paper
   addresses the GPGPU simulation challenge by proposing a framework,
   called GPGPU-MiniBench, for generating miniature, yet representative
   GPGPU workloads. GPGPU-MiniBench first summarizes the inherent execution
   behavior of existing GPGPU workloads in a profile. The central component
   in the profile is the Divergence Flow Statistics Graph (DFSG), which
   characterizes the dynamic control flow behavior including loops and
   branches of a GPGPU kernel. GPGPU-MiniBench generates a synthetic
   miniature GPGPU kernel that exhibits similar execution characteristics
   as the original workload, yet its execution time is much shorter thereby
   dramatically speeding up architectural simulation. Our experimental
   results show that GPGPU-MiniBench can speed up GPGPU architectural
   simulation by a factor of 49x on average and up to 589x, with an average
   IPC error of 4.7 percent across a broad set of GPGPU benchmarks from the
   CUDA SDK, Rodinia and Parboil benchmark suites. We also demonstrate the
   usefulness of GPGPU-MiniBench for driving GPU architecture exploration.}},

   gait-related disorders. To maximize potential clinical utility, such
   optimizations should utilize full-body three-dimensional
   patient-specific musculoskeletal models, generate dynamically consistent
   gait motions that reproduce pretreatment marker measurements closely,
   and achieve accurate foot motion tracking to permit deformable
   foot-ground contact modeling. This study enhances an existing residual
   elimination algorithm (REA) Remy, C. D., and Thelen, D. G., 2009,
   ``Optimal Estimation of Dynamically Consistent Kinematics and Kinetics
   for Forward Dynamic Simulation of Gait,{''} ASME J. Biomech. Eng.,
   131(3), p. 031005) to achieve all three requirements within a single
   gait optimization framework. We investigated four primary enhancements
   to the original REA: (1) manual modification of tracked marker weights,
   (2) automatic modification of tracked joint acceleration curves, (3)
   automatic modification of algorithm feedback gains, and (4) automatic
   calibration of model joint and inertial parameter values. We evaluated
   the enhanced REA using a full-body three-dimensional dynamic skeletal
   model and movement data collected from a subject who performed four
   distinct gait patterns: walking, marching, running, and bounding. When
   all four enhancements were implemented together, the enhanced REA
   achieved dynamic consistency with lower marker tracking errors for all
   segments, especially the feet (mean root-mean-square (RMS) errors of 3.1
   versus 18.4 mm), compared to the original REA. When the enhancements
   were implemented separately and in combinations, the most important one
   was automatic modification of tracked joint acceleration curves, while
   the least important enhancement was automatic modification of algorithm
   feedback gains. The enhanced REA provides a framework for future gait
   optimization studies that seek to predict subject-specific
   post-treatment gait patterns involving large changes in foot-ground
   contact patterns made possible through deformable foot-ground contact
   models.}},

Abstract = {{A drift mode accelerometer is a precision instrument for spacecraft that
   overcomes much of the acceleration noise and readout dynamic range
   limitations of traditional electrostatic accelerometers. It has the
   potential of achieving acceleration noise performance similar to that of
   drag-free systems over a restricted frequency band without the need for
   external drag-free control or continuous spacecraft propulsion. Like
   traditional accelerometers, the drift mode accelerometer contains a
   high-density test mass surrounded by an electrode housing, which can
   control and sense all six degrees of freedom of the test mass. Unlike
   traditional accelerometers, the suspension system is operated with a low
   duty cycle so that the limiting suspension force noise only acts over
   brief, known time intervals, which can be neglected in the data
   analysis. The readout is performed using a laser interferometer which is
   immune to the dynamic range limitations of even the best voltage
   references typically used to determine the inertial acceleration of
   electrostatic accelerometers. The drift mode accelerometer is a novel
   offshoot of the like-named operational mode of the LISA Pathfinder
   spacecraft, in which its test mass suspension system is cycled on and
   off to estimate the acceleration noise associated with the front-end
   electronics. This paper presents the concept of a drift mode
   accelerometer, describes the operation of such a device, develops models
   for its performance with respect to non-drag-free satellite geodesy and
   gravitational wave missions, and discusses plans for testing the
   performance of a prototype sensor in the laboratory using torsion
   pendula.}},

Abstract = {{Residential irrigation with reclaimed water is one method to reduce
   potable water withdrawals in the United States. However, little research
   has examined how customers use this often low-cost or free water. This
   study evaluates the change in water use for 510 reclaimed water
   customers who were converted from a flat rate to a commodity charge.
   Using actual water use data and an irrigation model, two metrics of
   efficiency were developed: portion of landscape needs satisfied and
   efficiency of application. After the commodity charge began, the
   reclaimed water customers decreased their use by 47\% and improved the
   efficiency of their application by 12\%. However, annually, between 14
   and 27\% of the users increased use compared with the flat-rate period.
   The impact of irrigable area was also evaluated and showed that
   customers with smaller irrigable areas were less efficient (26\%) than
   those with larger irrigable areas (52\%).}},

Title = {{Use of stereology to derive a new kinetic equation for mean curvature
   driven grain growth}},
Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{240-246}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The idea that normal grain growth driven by surface tension may be
   described theoretically by the hypothesis that the local velocity of an
   element of grain boundary is proportional to its local mean curvature
   dates back more than half a century. von Neumann was the first to derive
   this relation and used it to predict the rate of evolution of a two
   dimensional cell structure. MacPherson and Srolovitz extended this
   development to describe growth in three dimensions; however, their
   result was couched in terms that did not facilitate tests of the theory.
   In this paper expected value theorems established in stereology are
   invoked to extend their result to provide a new equation that predicts
   the rate of change of volume of grains in a microstructure which, while
   preserving the rigor and generality of the result, expresses it in terms
   of quantities that can be measured in microstructures. This is
   illustrated with a set of measurements based upon the theory derived
   from a grain growth simulation that successfully tests its predictions.
   It is interesting that this result also exhibits an ``n-6 rule{''} that
   is similar to, but not identical with, that contained in von Neumann's
   theory. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The canine knee is morphologically similar to the human knee and thus
   dogs have been used in experimental models to study human knee
   pathology. To date, there is limited data of normal canine 3D knee
   kinematics during daily activities. The objective of this study was to
   characterize 3D in-vivo femorotibial kinematics in normal dogs during
   commonly performed daily activities. Using single-plane fluoroscopy, six
   normal dogs were imaged performing walk, trot, sit, and stair ascent
   activities. CT-generated bone models were used for kinematic measurement
   using a 3D-to-2D model registration technique. Increasing knee flexion
   angle was typically associated with increasing tibial internal rotation,
   abduction and anterior translation during all four activities. The
   precise relationship between flexion angle and these movements varied
   both within and between activities. Significant differences in axial
   rotation and coronal angulation were found at the same flexion angle
   during different phases of the walk and trot. This was also found with
   anterior tibial translation during the trot only. Normal canine knees
   accommodate motion in all planes; precise kinematics within this
   envelope of motion are activity dependent. This data establishes the
   characteristics of normal 3D femorotibial joint kinematics in dogs that
   can be used as a comparison for future studies. (c) 2015 Orthopaedic

Journal = {{WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{16}},
Pages = {{1957-1981}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a cross-layer optimized geographic
   node-disjoint multipath routing algorithm, that is, two-phase geographic
   greedy forwarding plus. To optimize the system as a whole, our algorithm
   is designed on the basis of multiple layers' interactions, taking into
   account the following. First is the physical layer, where sensor nodes
   are developed to scavenge the energy from environment, that is, node
   rechargeable operation (a kind of idle charging process to nodes). Each
   node can adjust its transmission power depending on its current energy
   level (the main object for nodes with energy harvesting is to avoid the
   routing hole when implementing the routing algorithm). Second is the
   sleep scheduling layer, where an energy-balanced sleep scheduling
   scheme, that is, duty cycle (a kind of node sleep schedule that aims at
   putting the idle listening nodes in the network into sleep state such
   that the nodes will be awake only when they are needed), and
   energy-consumption-based connected k-neighborhood is applied to allow
   sensor nodes to have enough time to recharge energy, which takes nodes'
   current energy level as the parameter to dynamically schedule nodes to
   be active or asleep. Third is the routing layer, in which a forwarding
   node chooses the next-hop node based on 2-hop neighbor information
   rather than 1-hop. Performance of two-phase geographic greedy forwarding
   plus algorithm is evaluated under three different forwarding policies,
   to meet different application requirements. Our extensive simulations
   show that by cross-layer optimization, more shorter paths are found,
   resulting in shorter average path length, yet without causing much
   energy consumption. On top of these, a considerable increase of the
   network sleep rate is achieved. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Vegetative filter strips (VFS) are a widely adopted practice for
   limiting pesticide transport from adjacent fields to receiving
   waterbodies. The efficacy of VFS depends on site-specific input factors.
   To elucidate the complex and non-linear relationships among these
   factors requires a process-based modeling framework: Previous research
   proposed linking existing higher-tier environmental exposure models with
   a well-tested VFS model (VFSMOD). However, the framework assumed
   pesticide mass stored in the VFS was not available for transport in
   subsequent storm events. A new pesticide mass balance component was
   developed to estimate surface pesticide residue trapped in the VFS and
   its degradation between consecutive runoff events. The influence and
   necessity of the updated framework on acute and chronic estimated
   environmental concentrations (EECs) and percent reductions in EECs were
   investigated across three, 30-year U.S. EPA scenarios: Illinois corn,
   California tomato, and Oregon wheat. The updated framework with
   degradation predicted higher EECs than the existing framework without
   degradation for scenarios with greater sediment transport, longer VFS
   lengths, and highly sorbing and persistent pesticides. Global
   sensitivity analysis (GSA) assessed the relative importance of mass
   balance and degradation processes in the context of other input factors
   like VFS length (VL), organic-carbon sorption coefficient (K-oc), and
   soil and water half-lives. Considering VFS pesticide residue and
   degradation was not important if single, large runoff events controlled
   transport, as is typical for higher percentiles considered in exposure
   assessments. Degradation processes become more important when
   considering percent reductions in acute or chronic EECs, especially
   under scenarios with lower pesticide losses. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Models have been developed to simulate the process of ion exchange for
   water treatment. However the modeling of resin regeneration process,
   which can predict regeneration efficiency and residual stream for
   determining technology sustainability, was not incorporated into
   previous models. Therefore a model integrating both ion exchange and
   resin regeneration considering regeneration efficiency is needed for
   evaluating and improving ion exchange technology. This study developed
   an integrated model aiming to simulate ion exchange and resin
   regeneration in different configurations (fixed bed, fluidized bed) for
   the first time. The integrated model has been validated via comparing
   model predictions with experimental data. The impacts of dimensionless
   groups (i.e. the Peclet number, the diffusion modulus, and the Biot
   number) on ion exchange breakthrough curve have been analyzed using this
   model. In addition, this integrated model has been used to optimize the
   regeneration frequency to improve the overall performance of ion
   exchange. It demonstrated this integrated model could be a useful tool
   for further studies in ion exchange technology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Binder jetting 3D printing is a popular type of additive manufacturing
   and a powerful tool for creating parts and prototypes. Due to continuous
   movement of dry powders inside printer chambers and injection of
   resin-like binder fluid during printing, binder jetting 3D printers are
   a potential emission source of fine particulate matters (PM) and
   volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In this study, real-time measurements
   of total VOC (TVOCs) and aerosol (10 nm-10 mu m) during a 2-h continuous
   operation of a binder jetting printer were incorporated into a
   time-varying mass balance model to obtain the emission rates. The
   particle sizes between 205 and 407 nm had the highest emission rates by
   count. Time weighted average PM2.5 and PM10 and TVOC over a 24-h period
   all exceeded the USEPA ambient air quality standards. Continuous
   operation of the 3D printer led to a PM2.5 level 10 times greater than
   the standard (344 vs 35 mu g/m(3)) and a PM10 level 3 times higher than
   the standard (474 vs 150 mu g/m(3)). TVOC concentrations with a maximum
   value of 1725 mu g/m(3) exceeded upper limit concentrations recommended
   by the Environment Institute of European Commission, and USGBC-LEED.
   Ultrafine particles emitted from the binder jetting 3D printer were
   10(4)-10(5) times lower than those from typical fused deposition
   modeling (FDM) type of 3D printers using polylactic acid (PLA), but
   production of particles larger than 200 nm was significantly higher. The
   results suggest installing binder jetting 3D printers in an enclosure
   with proper ventilation for reducing the health risks. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Effects of natural organic matter on calcium and phosphorus
   co-precipitation}},
Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{138}},
Pages = {{218-224}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca) and natural organic matter (NOM) naturally
   occur in all aquatic ecosystems. However, excessive P loads can cause
   eutrophic or hyper-eutrophic conditions in these waters. As a result, P
   regulation is important for these impaired aquatic systems, and Ca-P
   co-precipitation is a vital mechanism of natural P removal in many
   alkaline systems, such as the Florida Everglades. The interaction of P,
   Ca, and NOM is also an important factor in lime softening and corrosion
   control, both critical processes of drinking water treatment.
   Determining the role of NOM in Ca-P co-precipitation is important for
   identifying mechanisms that may limit P removal in both natural and
   engineered systems. The main goal of this research is to assess the role
   of NOM in inhibiting Ca and P co-precipitation by: (1) measuring how Ca,
   NOM, and P concentrations affect NOM's potential inhibition of
   co-precipitation; (2) determining the effect of pH; and (3) evaluating
   the precipitated solids. Results showed that Ca-P co-precipitation
   occurs at pH 9.5 in the presence of high natural organic matter (NOM)
   (approximate to 30 mg L-1). The supersaturation of calcite overcomes the
   inhibitory effect of NOM seen at lower pH values. Higher initial P
   concentrations lead to both higher P precipitation rates and densities
   of P on the calcite surface. The maximum surface density of
   co-precipitated P on the precipitated calcite surface increases with
   increasing NOM levels, suggesting that NOM does prevent the
   co-precipitation of Ca and P. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {{12-21}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Breakdowns in team communication are a common source of error.
   Unfortunately, even when errors are identified, team members may not
   speak up about the error, often out of fear of confrontation. We propose
   that virtual humans may be used to help prepare people to speak up. To
   this end, we conducted a between-subjects study examining speaking up
   behavior with real and virtual humans. Forty-eight nurses participated
   in a team training exercise that gave them an opportunity to speak up to
   a surgeon (either virtual or human, depending on condition) in order to
   protect a patient's safety. Our results suggest that speaking up
   behavior with the virtual surgeon closely approximated behavior with the
   human surgeon: no significant differences were found in participants'
   use of influence tactics (p > 0.149) or in the outcomes obtained (p =
   0.788). However, participants were significantly more likely to ask the
   virtual anesthesiologist for input when working with the human surgeon
   (p < 0.05). Our findings suggest that participants found speaking up to
   the real and virtual surgeon to be of comparable difficulty. This is an
   important prerequisite before virtual humans can be used to prepare
   people to speak up about errors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{While the use of virtual characters in medical education is becoming
   more and more commonplace, an understanding of the role they can play in
   empathetic communication skills training is still lacking. This paper
   presents a study aimed at building this understanding by determining if
   students can respond to a virtual patient's statement of concern with an
   empathetic response. A user study was conducted at the University of
   Florida College of Medicine in which early stage medical students
   interacted with virtual patients in one session and real humans trained
   to portray real patients (i.e., standardized patients) in a separate
   session about a week apart. During the interactions, the virtual and
   `real' patients presented the students with empathetic opportunities
   which were later rated by outside observers. The results of pairwise
   comparisons indicate that empathetic responses made to virtual patients
   were rated as significantly more empathetic than responses made to
   standardized patients. Even though virtual patients may be perceived as
   artificial, the educational benefit of employing them for training
   medical students' empathetic communications skills is that virtual
   patients offer a low pressure interaction which allows students to
   reflect on their responses. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   derived for the shear center distance - distance of the shear center
   from the tube axis. Finite element analysis of the tubes is performed
   using shell elements. The agreement between analytical and numerical
   results is excellent. It is found that the shear center distance is
   independent of the radius of the tube but proportional to the length of

Title = {{Effects of flue-gas parameters on low temperature NO reduction over a
   Cu-promoted CeO2-TiO2 catalyst}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{159}},
Pages = {{876-882}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{A sol-gel synthesized Cu-promoted CeO2-TiO2 (CuCeTi) catalyst was used
   in the low temperature selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of nitrogen
   monoxide (NO) with ammonia (NH3). The combination of copper oxide (CuO)
   and cerium oxide (CeO2) improved SCR performance at low temperatures by
   increasing the dispersion of active species and the volume of surface
   oxygen (O-2) with low-temperature activity. NO conversion on the CuCeTi
   catalyst exceeded 90\% at temperatures higher than 200 degrees C.
   Although the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was much higher than that
   in a real SCR reactor, reaching 27,000 h(-1), its inhibitory effect on
   NO conversion became insignificant as the temperature increased. Within
   its flue gas concentration range, O-2 had a negligible effect on NO
   conversion. The inhibitory effect of water vapor (H2O) was reversible,
   and almost indiscernible at 300 degrees C. Sulfur-dioxide (SO2)
   concentration affected NO conversion. At concentrations lower than 100
   ppm, SO2 promoted NO conversion and at SO2 concentrations higher than
   100 ppm, NO conversion decreased. The ammonium sulfates deposited on the
   surface of the catalyst as a product of the reaction with SO2 were
   primarily responsible for the irreversible deactivation of the catalyst
   at low temperatures. Thus, high temperatures were found to alleviate the
   inhibitory effect of SO2. NO conversion exceeded 80\% at 300 degrees C,
   even when the concentration of SO2 was as high as 800 ppm. Mercury vapor
   and adsorbed mercury oxide (HgO) had negligible effects on NO reduction
   over the CuCeTi catalyst. This study provides new information on the
   promotional and inhibitory effects of individual flue-gas parameters and
   components on NO conversion over a novel CuCeTi catalyst. This
   information has fundamental implications for industrial applications of
   the CuCeTi catalyst in coal-fired power plants. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Silicon carbide is used for a variety of applications, however,
   sintering still remains a challenge due to the high temperature and
   pressure required as well as the need for sintering aids. The use of
   preceramic polymers as binder is a promising technique for pressureless
   low-temperature sintering of SiC without sintering aids. However, the
   mechanical and thermophysical properties as well as the microstructure
   of bodies sintered through this technique has not been extensively
   documented. One of the main polymers which has gained attention in the
   past few years as a SiC preceramic is allylhydridopolycarbosilane
   (AHPCS). Here, using AHPCS as binder, silicon carbide pellets were
   sintered at temperatures as low as 930 A degrees C, and the
   microstructural, mechanical, and thermophysical property
   characterization is presented. Compared to conventionally sintered SiC,
   the material shows similar fracture toughness, lower hardness, strength,
   and thermal conductivity. The observed properties are explained as a
   result of residual porosity combined with amorphous SiC at the grain
   boundaries.}},

Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},

Volume = {{320}},
Pages = {{126-139}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel meta-heuristic optimization algorithm, named
   Adaptive Simplified Human Learning Optimization (ASHLO), which is
   inspired by the human learning mechanisms. Three learning-operators,
   i.e. the random learning operator, the individual learning operator, and
   the social learning operator, are developed to generate new solutions
   and search for the optima by mimicking the learning behaviors of humans.
   The numerical functions, deceptive functions and 0-1 knapsack problems',
   are adopted as benchmark problems to validate the performance of ASHLO,
   and the results are compared with those of binary particle swarm
   optimization (BPSO), modified binary differential. evolution (MBDE), the
   binary fruit fly optimization algorithm (bFOA) and adaptive binary
   harmony search (ABHS). The experimental results demonstrate that the
   developed ASHLO significantly outperforms BPSO, MBDE, bFOA and ABHS and
   has a robust search ability for various problems. With the adaptive
   strategy, the search ability of ASHLO is improved further especially on
   the high-dimensional and complicated problems. Considering the ease of
   implementation, the excellence of global search ability and the
   robustness for various problems, ASHLO is a promising optimization tool
   for scientific research and engineering applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   extrusion}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{225}},
Pages = {{357-368}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{One of the basic problems in the design of polymer extrusion dies for
   multi-lumen micro profiles is the previously unknown extrudate swells,
   since they are more complex than those in axisymmetric extrusions. To
   investigate the three-dimensional extrudate swell of such geometries,
   numerical simulations and experiments are performed for the extrusion of
   a double-lumen micro profile using polypropylene. The selected profile
   exhibits typical non-axisymmetric geometry, uneven thickness and
   micro-scale dimension. A double convected pom-pom model considering the
   micro size effect is proposed to characterize viscoelastic properties of
   the polymer melt. Predictions are compared with experimental results as
   well as simulations using the power law model, and show the capacity of
   the proposed model for assessing the anisotropic swelling
   quantitatively. Influences of micro size effect, volumetric flow rate
   and material parameters on extrudate swell are investigated by
   parametric studies. It is found that swell ratios of various positions
   on the extrudate cross section are significantly different. The swelling
   anisotropy degree is enhanced with increasing volumetric flow rate as
   well as material parameters of second normal force coefficient and
   branching degree, while it is suppressed as the ratio of orientation to
   stretching relaxation time increases. The influence mechanisms of
   material parameters on extrudate swell are also discussed in detail. It
   is suggested that the anisotropic extrudate swell induced by micro size
   effect is significant and should be taken into account in high accuracy
   micro profile extrusions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Drought is one of the major climatic disasters intimidating winter wheat
   production in the Huang-Huai-Hai (3H) Plain of China. The yield damage
   caused by drought tends to increase in the future, indicated by a
   pronounced uprising of drought events under RCP 8.5 scenario in terms of
   its affecting magnitude and area. This paper presents a modeling
   approach by using crop model DSSAT and hydrological indices to assess
   the vulnerability of winter wheat to future potential drought, based on
   an integrated assessment of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity.
   Our results demonstrate that Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei and Shandong are
   more exposed and sensitive to potential drought than other regions in
   3H. Traditional irrigation has the greater benefits in northern 3H Plain
   than southern regions, but is still insufficient to impede the yield
   loss due to potential drought. Under RCP 8.5 emission scenario and the
   period of 20102050, the worst drought effect is projected to occur
   around 2030. More than half of 3H plain are subject to high drought
   vulnerability. With increasing drought risks, we suggest immediate and
   appropriate adaptation actions to be taken before 2030s, especially in
   Shandong and Hebei, the most vulnerable provinces of 3H plain. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The heating of magnetic nanoparticle suspensions subjected to
   alternating magnetic fields enables a variety of emerging applications
   such as magnetic fluid hyperthermia and triggered drug release.
   Rosensweig (2002) {[}251 obtained a model for the heat dissipation rate
   of a collection of non-interacting particles. However, the assumptions
   made in this analysis make it rigorously valid only in the limit of
   small applied magnetic field amplitude and frequency (i.e., values of
   the Langevin parameter that are much less than unity and frequencies
   below the inverse relaxation time). In this contribution we approach the
   problem from an alternative point of view by solving the
   phenomenological magnetization relaxation equation exactly for the case
   of arbitrary magnetic field amplitude and frequency and by solving a
   more accurate magnetization relaxation equation numerically. We also use
   rotational Brownian dynamics simulations of non-interacting magnetic
   nanoparticles subjected to an alternating magnetic Field to estimate the
   rate of energy dissipation and compare the results of the
   phenomenological theories to the particle-scale simulations. The results
   are summarized in terms of a normalized energy dissipation rate and show
   that Rosensweig's expression provides an upper bound on the energy
   dissipation rate achieved at high field frequency and amplitude.
   Estimates of the predicted dependence of energy dissipation rate,
   quantified as specific absorption rate (SAR), on magnetic field
   amplitude and frequency, and particle core and hydrodynamic diameter,
   are also given. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved}},

Abstract = {{Continuous carbon fiber composites with self-healing properties are
   developed using novel thermally responsive healable polyurethanes that
   incorporate Diels-Alder cycloaddition adducts. Short beam shear testing,
   which generates delamination inside the composite panels, is conducted
   to evaluate the healing efficiency. This testing shows that both the
   composites are stable and that they can be repeatedly healed, achieving
   average healing efficiencies of similar to 85\% for the first healing
   cycle and similar to 73\% for the second cycle. The results demonstrate
   that the intrinsic properties of the composites can be maintained after
   healing has occurred and since the healing ability of the material is
   only a function of the DA moieties in the polymer matrix, the carbon
   fiber does not require any treatments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Here we report a single-step direct writing technology for making
   three-dimensional (3D) macroporous photonic crystal patterns on a new
   type of pressure-responsive shape memory polymer (SMP). This approach
   integrates two disparate fields that do not typically intersect: the
   well-established templating nanofabrication and shape memory materials.
   Periodic arrays of polymer macropores templated from self-assembled
   colloidal crystals are squeezed into disordered arrays in an unusual
   shape memory ``cold{''} programming process. The recovery of the
   original macroporous photonic crystal lattices can be triggered by
   direct writing at ambient conditions using both macroscopic and
   nanoscopic tools, like a pencil or a nanoindenter. Interestingly, this
   shape memory disorder order transition is reversible and the photonic
   crystal patterns can be erased and regenerated hundreds of times,
   promising the making of reconfigurable/rewritable nanooptical devices.
   Quantitative insights into the shape memory recovery of collapsed
   macropores induced by the lateral shear stresses in direct writing are
   gained through fundamental investigations on important process
   parameters, including the tip material, the critical pressure and
   writing speed for triggering the recovery of the deformed macropores,
   and the minimal feature size that can be directly written on the SMP
   membranes. Besides straightforward applications in photonic crystal
   devices, these smart mechanochromic SMPs that are sensitive to various
   mechanical stresses could render important technological applications
   ranging from chromogenic stress and impact sensors to rewritable
   high-density optical data storage media.}},

Abstract = {{The use of shared infrastructure to direct natural processes for the
   benefit of humans has been a central feature of human social
   organization for millennia. Today, more than ever, people interact with
   one another and the environment through shared human-made infrastructure
   (the Internet, transportation, the energy grid, etc.). However, there
   has been relatively little work on how the design characteristics of
   shared infrastructure affect the dynamics of social-ecological systems
   (SESs) and the capacity of groups to solve social dilemmas associated
   with its provision. Developing such understanding is especially
   important in the context of global change where design criteria must
   consider how specific aspects of infrastructure affect the capacity of
   SESs to maintain vital functions in the face of shocks. Using
   small-scale irrigated agriculture (the most ancient and ubiquitous
   example of public infrastructure systems) as a model system, we show
   that two design features related to scale and the structure of benefit
   flows can induce fundamental changes in qualitative behavior, i.e.,
   regime shifts. By relating the required maintenance threshold (a design
   feature related to infrastructure scale) to the incentives facing users
   under different regimes, our work also provides some general guidance on
   determinants of robustness of SESs under globalization-related stresses.}},

Abstract = {{Using a high-speed optical imaging system specifically designed for
   observing the lightning attachment process, we have documented the
   attachment process for six strokes in three natural lightning flashes.
   All strokes initiate at a height above ground and propagate
   bidirectionally from that height, similar to the return strokes of
   artificially initiated (triggered) lightning previously reported by Wang
   et al. (2013, 2014). Though the data are quite limited, these natural
   return strokes suggest a correlation between larger peak current and
   greater initiation height. Initiation heights determined here span
   12-60mwith a typical uncertainty of less than 10 m. The initial upward
   return stroke luminosity speeds range from(0.8 +/- 0.2) to (2.0 +/- 0.4)
   x 10(8) m/s. Two first return strokes downward luminosity speeds are
   assessed as (1.6 +/- 0.3) x 10(7) m/s and (1.4 +/- 0.3) x 10(8) m/s. One
   of the first return strokes appeared to be initiated with a stepping
   pulse discharge of its leader as an inseparable part of the return
   stroke.}},

Abstract = {{We measured current and luminosity at the channel bottom of 12 triggered
   lightning discharges including 44 return strokes, 23 M-components, and 1
   initial continuous current pulse. Combined current and luminosity data
   for impulse currents span a 10-90\% risetime range from 0.15 to 192 mu
   s. Current risetime and luminosity risetime at the channel bottom are
   roughly linearly correlated (tau(r,l)=0.71 tau(1.08)(r,L)). We observed
   a time delay between current and the resultant luminosity at the channel
   bottom, both measured at 20\% of peak amplitude, that is approximately
   linearly related to both the luminosity 10-90\% risetime (Delta t(20,b)
   = 0.24 tau(1.1)(r,L)2) and the current 10-90\% risetime (Delta t(20,b) =
   0.35 tau(1.03)(r,l)). At the channel bottom, the peak current is roughly
   proportional to the square root of the peak luminosity (I-P =
   21.89L(P)(0.57)) over the full range of current and luminosity
   risetimes. For two return strokes we provide measurements of stroke
   luminosity vs. time for 11 increasing heights to 115m altitude. We
   assume that measurements above the channel bottom behave similarly to
   those at the bottom and find that (1) one return stroke current peak
   decayed at 115m to about 47\% of its peak value at channel bottom, while
   the luminosity peak at 115m decayed to about 20\%, and for the second
   stroke 38\% and 12\%, respectively; and (2) measured upward return
   stroke luminosity speeds of the two strokes of 1.10 x 10(8) and 9.7 x
   10(7) ms(-1) correspond to current speeds about 30\% faster. These
   results represent the first determination of return stroke current speed
   and current peak value above ground derived from measured return stroke

Abstract = {{Detailed infrared (2.7-5.5 mu m) images of bidirectional leaders
   produced by the cloud of small (typical radius of 0.5 mu m), positively
   charged water droplets are presented. The leader was composed of the
   downward extending positive part and the upward extending negative part,
   these two parts (both branched, although in different ways) being
   connected by the single-channel middle part. The downward extending part
   included the tortuous positive leader channel (similar to its upward
   extending counterpart observed when the cloud polarity was negative)
   that was often accompanied by much less tortuous but often equally
   bright downward extending plasma formations of unknown nature. Very
   faint positive streamer zone was also observed. Either the positive
   leader channel or the unusual plasma formation (UPF) can come in contact
   with the grounded plane. The upward extending part is associated with a
   large network of faint channels, mostly fanning out of the upper part of
   the usually much brighter leader channel and apparently pervading the
   entire upper part of the cloud. Some of those faint channels could be
   unusually long and bright negative streamers, while others could be
   similar to UPFs. The IR luminosity along the brightest part of the
   bidirectional leader channel is often nonuniform. Some variations in
   channel brightness are localized and suggest the involvement of space
   leader-type processes at multiple positions along the channel, changes
   in channel orientation, or variations in channel radius.}},

Abstract = {{Although the production of X-rays from natural and rocket-triggered
   lightning leaders have been studied in detail over the last 10 years,
   the energy spectrum of the X-rays has never been well measured because
   the X-rays are emitted in very short but intense bursts that result in
   pulse pileup in the detectors. The energy spectrum is important because
   it provides information about the source mechanism for producing the
   energetic runaway electrons and about the electric fields that they
   traverse. We have recently developed and operated the first spectrometer
   for the energetic radiation from lightning. The instrument is part of
   the Atmospheric Radiation Imagery and Spectroscopy (ARIS) project and
   will be referred to as ARIS-S (ARIS Spectrometer). It consists of seven
   3 `' NaI(Tl)/photomultiplier tube scintillation detectors with different
   thicknesses of attenuators, ranging from no attenuator to more than 1 `'
   of lead placed over the detector (all the detectors are in a 1/8 `'
   thick aluminum box). Using X-ray pulses preceding 48 return strokes in 8
   rocket-triggered lightnings, we found that the spectrum of X-rays from
   leaders is too soft to be consistent with Relativistic Runaway Electron
   Avalanche. It has a power law dependence on the energies of the photons,
   and the power index, lambda, is between 2.5 and 3.5. We present the
   details of the design of the instrument and the results of the analysis
   of the lightning data acquired during the summer of 2012.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{143}},
Number = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{It is becoming recognized from simulations, and to a lesser extent from
   experiment, that the classical Helfrich-Canham membrane continuum
   mechanics model can be fruitfully enriched by the inclusion of molecular
   tilt, even in the fluid, chain disordered, biologically relevant phase
   of lipid bilayers. Enriched continuum theories then add a tilt modulus..
   to accompany the well recognized bending modulus.. Different enrichment
   theories largely agree for many properties, but it has been noticed that
   there is considerable disagreement in one prediction; one theory
   postulates that the average length of the hydrocarbon chain tails
   increases strongly with increasing tilt and another predicts no
   increase. Our analysis of an all-atom simulation favors the latter
   theory, but it also shows that the overall tail length decreases
   slightly with increasing tilt. We show that this deviation from
   continuum theory can be reconciled by consideration of the average shape
   of the tails, which is a descriptor not obviously includable in
   continuum theory. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{TiO2 is one of the most promising anode candidates for novel lithium ion
   batteries which combines the advantage of state of art anode graphite
   and the safety of Li4Ti5O12. However, the low intrinsic conductivity
   limits its electrochemical properties. In this paper, a sol-gel based
   route is presented to produce nanosize TiO2/CNT core-shell composite
   fibers. Fiber diameter is 253 +/- 63 nm as-spun and 126 +/- 35 nm with
   subsequent calcination to obtain crystalline phase. Crystallite size is
   between 13-18 nm. The as-prepared core-shell fibers exhibited similar to
   1.5 time higher electronic conductivity, 1.6-3 times greater lithium
   diffusivity which resulted in 25\% more galvanostatic capacity at C/10
   compared to bare TiO2 nanofibers. The enhancement in high-rate
   performance at 10C was over 80\% which was crucial for fast charging
   applications. CNT additives were found to enhance the electronic
   conductivity, lithium diffusivity and electrochemical properties of the
   TiO2 nanofibers by both providing an alternative electron and lithium
   ion conducting mechanism as well as synergistic effects, which were
   systematically reviewed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   vertical bar C batteries}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{293}},
Pages = {{57-64}},
Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{A process model for impedance analysis was developed in the context of
   reactions and transport processes that were hypothesized to govern the
   performance of the Li-ion battery. At the carbon electrode, lithium ions
   and solvent were considered to react to form a solid-electrolyte
   interphase (SEI). In addition, lithium ions were assumed to diffuse
   through the SEI to intercalate into the graphene layers. As these two
   processes involve an addition of currents, the corresponding impedances
   were considered to be in parallel. Anomalous diffusion of lithium ions
   was invoked at the LiCoO2 electrode to account for the low-frequency
   line that had a slope steeper than that predicted by ordinary diffusion.
   This model was fit to all impedance data collected. The model provided a
   good description for impedance of batteries under normal operating
   potentials and temperatures. The contribution of anomalous diffusion was
   diminished at elevated temperatures, suggesting that the free-energy
   well associated with anomalous or sticky diffusion was shallow. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A series of Au(I) and Pt(II) acetylide complexes of a Itconjugated
   donor-acceptor-donor (D-A-D) chromophore were studied to develop
   quantitative structure property relationships for their photophysical
   and nonlinear optical properties. The D-A-D chromophore consists of a
   ``TBT{''} unit, where T = 3-hexyl-2,5-thienylene and BTD =
   2,1,3-benzothiadiazole, capped with ethynylene groups. The D-A-D
   chromophore is functionalized with Au(I)PR3 (R = -Me and -Ph) and
   trans-Pt(II)(PR3)(2)-CCPh (R = -Me and -Bu) auxochromes{''}. All of the
   metal complexes were characterized by ground-state absorption,
   photoluminescence, nanosecond transient absorption, and two-photon
   absorption (2PA) spectroscopy. The experiments provided quantitative
   values of the photophysical parameters, including rates for radiative
   decay and intersystem crossing (ISC), triplet yields, and two-photon
   absorption cross sections. Pronounced solvatochromism in the
   fluorescence spectra suggests an enhanced dipole moment in the excited
   state of the complexes compared to the unmetalated TBT chromophore. The
   gold complexes feature larger fluorescence quantum yields and longer
   emission lifetimes compared to platinum. The Pt(II) complexes exhibit
   enhanced triplet triplet absorption, reduced triplet-state lifetimes,
   and larger singlet oxygen quantum yields, consistent with more efficient
   ISC compared to the Au(I) complexes. When excited by 100 fs pulses, all
   of the D-A-D chromophores exhibit moderate two-photon absorption in the
   near-infrared between 700 and 900 nm. The 2PA cross section for the
   Au(I) complexes is almost the same as the unmetalated D-A-D chromophore
   (similar to 100 GM). The Pt(II) complexes exhibit significantly enhanced
   2PA compared to the other chromophores, reaching 1000 GM at 750 nm.
   Taken together, the results indicate that the Pt(II) center is
   considerably more effective in inducing singlet-triplet ISC and in
   enhancing the 2PA cross section. This result reveals the greater promise
   for Pt(II) acetylides in chromophores for temporal and frequency agile
   nonlinear absorption.}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneous hydrogenation involves chemisorption (Chem), nucleation
   and growth by interfacial movement (NG) and diffusion (Diff). The
   slowest one of these phenomena is generally considered to control
   hydrogenation. However, the considered phenomenon cannot explain the
   hydrogenation in its entirety. Multiple phenomena can contribute to
   different extents towards hydrogenation. Contributions of multiple
   phenomena are explained by developing functions of the form xi(t) = Pi(i
   = Chem, NG, Diff) (j = Chem,) (i not equal j) f(j) (t)center
   dot(xi(ai(t))(i). xi(t) is the converted fraction of hydride. The
   indices a(i)(t) represent the extents to which the explicitly considered
   phenomena act (represented by xi(i)(t) from literature). Constraints
   Sigma(i)a(i)(t)6 = 1 and the condition f(j)(t)-> 1 ascertain the
   exhaustiveness of the phenomena considered. Mg-MgH2 is considered as a
   proof-of-concept system to apply the present approach. The (t) functions
   are applied to describe the hydrogenation behaviour of Mg (similar to 44
   mu m) at 210 degrees C and P-H2 = 1 MPa. Present analysis shows that
   multiple phenomena can act simultaneously and the dominant one (highest
   value of index) controls the hydrogenation. This dominant phenomenon can
   change with time such that chemisorption followed by NG and finally
   diffusion contribute in controlling hydrogenation. The estimated
   activation energies for NG (42 kJ/mol H) and diffusion (97 kJ/mol H)
   compare well with literature. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy

   parameters were close to those of long-spark leaders observed in the
   same experiments, while the channel morphology was distinctly different
   from that of leaders, so that UPFs can be viewed as a new type of
   in-cloud discharge. These formations can occur in the absence of spark
   leaders and appear to be manifestations of collective processes
   building, essentially from scratch, a complex hierarchical network of
   interacting channels at different stages of development (some of which
   are hot and live for milliseconds). We believe that the phenomenon

Abstract = {{Simultaneous measurements of intra-cortical electrophysiology and
   hemodynamic signals in primates are essential for relating human
   neuroimaging studies with intra-cortical electrophysiology in monkeys.
   Previously, technically challenging and resourcefully demanding
   techniques such as fMRI and intrinsic-signal optical imaging have been
   used for such studies. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy is a
   relatively less cumbersome neuroimagingmethod that uses near-infrared
   light to detect small changes in concentrations of oxy-hemoglobin (HbO),
   deoxyhemoglobin (HbR) and total hemoglobin (HbT) in a volume of
   tissuewith high specificity and temporal resolution. FNIRS is thus a
   good candidate for hemodynamic measurements in primates to acquire local
   hemodynamic signals during electrophysiological recordings. To test the
   feasibility of using epidural fNIRS with concomitant extracellular
   electrophysiology, we recorded neuronal and hemodynamic activity from
   the primary visual cortex of two anesthetized monkeys during visual
   stimulation. We recorded fNIRS epidurally, using one emitter and two
   detectors. We performed simultaneous cortical electrophysiology using
   tetrodes placed between the fNIRS sensors. We observed robust and
   reliable responses to the visual stimulation in both {[}HbO] and {[}HbR]
   signals, and quantified the signal-to-noise ratio of the epidurally
   measured signals. We also observed a positive correlation between
   stimulus-induced modulation of {[}HbO] and {[}HbR] signals and strength
   of neural modulation. Briefly, our results show that epidural fNIRS
   detects single-trial responses to visual stimuli on a trial-by-trial
   basis, and when coupled with cortical electrophysiology, is a promising
   tool for studying local hemodynamic signals and neurovascular coupling.

Abstract = {{Purpose: Propofol emulsions have limited shelf life and safety concerns
   for injection. Microemulsions of propofol are thermodynamically stable
   and simpler to manufacture, but cause additional pain on injection. We
   propose a novel micro to macro (M2M) approach of destabilizing a
   microemulsion immediately prior to injection.
   Methods: Microemulsions of propofol were prepared at two to three times
   the drug loadings of commercial formulations. We determined suitable
   microemulsion compositions which destabilize into macroemulsions after
   two or three fold dilutions with water. Droplet growth after dilution
   was measured with dynamic light scattering. Increasing solution
   turbidity after dilution was also measured optically with millisecond
   resolution. Experimental data was analyzed in the context of a
   coalescence model.
   Results: Microemulsions rapidly coalesce into larger droplet size
   macroemulsions after dilution according to the phase diagram shift. The
   resulting macroemulsions are metastable retaining their droplet size for
   several hours. Droplet growth occurs on the order of seconds and a
   metastable size of about 1 micron is reached in minutes. Rates of
   droplet growth and metastable droplet sizes depend on the surfactant
   composition. The coalescence model predicts droplet growth with good
   agreement but only after accounting for the finite probability of
   coalescence from each collision.
   Conclusions: The M2M concept has been demonstrated for the anesthetic
   drug propofol which may improve stability and manufacturability in
   addition to reducing pain on injection. This approach could be adapted
   to other hydrophobic vesicant drugs as well. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This study was primarily focused on evaluating the effect of different
   interlayer bonding conditions on change in critical responses for real
   pavements related to performance and service life using the results from
   the finite element analysis (FEA) and full-scale field tests. The
   current lack of thorough understanding and mechanistic characterization
   of the interlayer bonding behavior that enables to accurately simulate
   the change in structural responses of pavement system is probably the
   greatest deficiency in our ability to properly evaluate the effect of
   interlayer bonding condition for asphalt pavements. Also, most of the
   pavement models previously introduced assumed either full-bond or
   no-bond condition which is not a realistic interlayer condition for
   pavements in the field. Therefore, there is a need to develop improved
   model to accurately predict the change in pavement critical responses
   for real pavement system due to the different interlayer bonding
   conditions. Results indicated that the pavement model developed was
   capable of accurately predicting the change in pavement critical
   responses due to the different interlayer bonding conditions and the
   predicted values were matched well with those measured from the
   full-scale field test. Also, it was found that a good interlayer bonding
   condition can positively affect the strain responses of asphalt pavement
   that results in potential structural benefits for enhanced pavement
   performance. Based on the comparative observations between analytical
   and experimental results, it was confirmed that the interlayer bonding
   condition plays a significant role on structural response
   characteristics of layered flexible pavement system and therefore the
   pavement service life. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Although the ionic radius of Si4+ is smaller than Hf4+, with increasing
   Si occupancy, the unit cell volume slightly increases; possible
   mechanisms for this effect are discussed. Moreover, the refined results
   provide evidence of the existence of a non-equilibrium phase of

Abstract = {{Predators non-consumptively induce prey habitat shifts, driving
   trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs) with basal resources.
   Whether prey seek refuge within or avoid predator-containing patches
   determines the spatial re-distribution of prey and influences the nature
   of resulting TMIIs. In a southeastern US salt marsh, we tested how 2
   species of sit-and-wait benthic predatory crab non-consumptively affect
   the habitat choices of grazing snails and how the resultant behavior
   affects cordgrass health. We first observed that snails climb higher on
   cordgrass around naturally occurring crab burrows and that this habitat
   shift corresponds with increased cordgrass leaf damage, suggesting a
   localized TMII. Then, by adding caged crabs to artificial burrows in the
   field, we found causative evidence that both crab species could drive
   snails upwards to the cordgrass canopy, thereby increasing leaf damage
   within a similar to 12 cm radius, but found no evidence that
   experimentally added crabs induce horizontal dispersal of snails. Next,
   in a marsh undergoing die-off, we added caged crabs to remnant cordgrass
   patches being rapidly colonized by snails. Crabs did not affect the rate
   of snail colonization of remnant patches, but did drive snails upwards
   once they had colonized a patch, suggesting snails do not preferentially
   avoid-but do alter how they locally utilize-patches of cordgrass in
   marsh die-off contexts. Our documentation of the spatial-scale and
   dimensionality of TMIIs in the field paves the way for spatially
   explicit models of this interaction. More generally, our results suggest
   that TMIIs may be consistent, predictable and tractable, lending
   themselves to incorporation into food-web models.}},
