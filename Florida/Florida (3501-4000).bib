Abstract = {{There has been significant effort over the past two decades in the
   treatment of malignancies of epithelial origin, including some of the
   most devastating of cancers, such as colorectal cancer (CRC), squamous
   call carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC), and carcinomas of the
   pancreas, lungs, (both Small Cell and Non-Small Cell), renal cell,
   prostate, bladder and breast. Recurring, refractory HNSCC is a
   particularly difficult cancer to treat once the tumors recur due to
   mutations that are resistant to repeat chemotherapy and radiation. In
   addition, repeat surgery is often difficult due to the requirement of
   significant surgical margins that may not be possible due to the
   attending potential functional deficits (e. g., salivary glands, nerves
   and major blood vessels in confined areas). In this study FaDu HNSCC
   xenograft tumors in SCID mice were imaged, and ``optical{''}, as opposed
   to ``surgical{''} margins defined for the tumor being treated. The
   subsequent two-photon treatment irradiation was computer-controlled to
   carry out the tumor treatment by rastering the laser beam throughout the
   tumor volume plus the defined optical margins simultaneously. In our
   initial studies, up to 85\% regression in tumor volume was observed in 5
   days post PDT, with complete tumor regression in 18 days. No re-growth
   was observed up to 41 days post-PDT, with little or no scarring and
   complete hair re-growth. However, competition between imaging and PDT
   moieties was also observed in some mouse models, possibly favoring tumor
   re-growth. Strategies to selectively optimize the PDT effect will be
   discussed.}},

Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{335-349}},
Abstract = {{Due to uncertainties in material properties and use conditions,
   reliability predictions are often subject to considerable error. Such
   inaccurate predictions lead to maintenance decisions that are expensive
   or not able to prevent failures. This article proposes a Bayesian
   approach for failure time prediction of degrading components from
   condition data that accounts for uncertainties and incorporates prior
   information on degradation behavior via prior distributions. The
   approach is based on posterior sampling to handle more general
   statistical models. Simulation examples are presented to show that by
   incorporating condition monitoring data or including prior knowledge the
   effectiveness of maintenance decisions can be significantly improved.
   Application of the approach in a real setting is illustrated using data
   from the literature.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to monitor glucose levels in chronic wound fluid of diabetic
   patients is a promising theranostic approach in chronic wound healing.
   Phenylboronic acid polymers are glucose- and pH-responsive materials. In
   the presence of glucose, these polymers reversibly form cyclic boronate
   esters, changing the properties of the polymer and forming the basis of
   glucose sensing. In this report, poly(4vinylphenylboronic acid) (PVPBA)
   was covalently grafted to the pores of porous silicon (pSi) films
   (pSiPVPBA). Polymer switching in response to changing pH and glucose
   concentration was monitored by means of interferometric reflectance
   spectroscopy (IRS). We observed that a shift of the boronic acid
   equilibrium between the neutral and anionic form in the polymer
   translated into refractive index changes that could be detected as a
   variation of the effective optical thickness (EOT) of the pSi-PVPBA
   film. The pSi/polymer composite was further investigated as a platform
   for the detection of glucose. Using this sensing platform, we were able
   to detect glucose in a buffer solution as low as 0.15 mM and also in a
   wound fluid sample without encountering interferences.}},

Title = {{Querying Cardinal Directions between Complex Objects in Data Warehouses}},
Journal = {{FUNDAMENTA INFORMATICAE}},

Pages = {{177-202}},
Abstract = {{Data warehouses help to store and analyze large multidimensional
   datasets and provide enterprise decision support. With an increased
   availability of spatial data in recent years, several new strategies
   have been proposed to enable their integration into data warehouses and
   and perform complex OLAP analysis. Cardinal directions have turned out
   to be very important qualitative spatial relations due to their numerous
   applications in spatial way finding, GIS, qualitative spatial reasoning
   and in domains such as cognitive sciences, AI and robotics. They are
   frequently used as selection and restriction criteria in spatial
   queries. In data warehouses, cardinal directions can be used to perform
   spatial OLAP and feature navigation operations. In this article, we
   introduce and develop the Objects Interaction Graticule (OIG) approach
   to query the cardinal direction relations among spatio-temporal objects
   in data warehouses. First, we apply a tiling strategy that determines
   the zones belonging to the nine cardinal directions of each spatial
   object at a particular time and intersects them. This leads to a
   collection of grids over time called the Objects Interaction Graticule
   (OIG). For each grid cell, the information about the spatial objects
   that intersect it is stored in a Objects Interaction Matrix. In the
   second phase, an interpretation method is applied to these matrices to
   determine the cardinal direction between the moving objects. The results
   obtained for each valid instant over the objects' lifetime describe the
   variation in the objects movement over time. Thisis integrated as a
   spatio-temporalOLAP operation in a novel moving objects data warehouse
   (MODW) that provides an extensible framework for supporting complex
   structured objects. Finally, we define new directional predicates that
   extend MDX querying and leverage OLAP between moving objects.}},

Abstract = {{A MEMS-based common-path endoscopic imaging probe for 3D swept-source
   optical coherence tomography (SSOCT) has been developed. The common path
   is achieved by setting the reference plane at the rear surface of the
   GRIN lens inside the probe. MEMS devices have the advantages of low
   cost, small size and fast speed, which are suitable for miniaturizing
   endoscopic probes. The aperture size of the two-axis MEMS mirror
   employed in this endoscopic probe is 1 mm by 1 mm and the footprint of
   the MEMS chip is 1.55 mm by 1.7 mm. The MEMS mirror achieves large two
   dimensional optical scan angles up to 34 degrees at 4.0 V. The
   endoscopic probe using the MEMS mirror as the scan engine is only 4.0 mm
   in diameter. Additionally, an optimum length of the GRIN lens is
   established to remove the artifacts in the SSOCT images generated from
   the multiple interfaces inside the endoscopic imaging probe. The MEMS
   based common-path probe demonstrates real time 3D OCT images of human
   finger with 10.6 mu m axial resolution, 17.5 mu m lateral resolution and
   1.0 mm depth range at a frame rate of 50 frames per second.}},

Abstract = {{Multistatic continuous active sonar (MCAS) systems involve the
   transmission and reception of multiple continuous probing sequences and
   can achieve significantly enhanced target detection and parameter
   estimation performance through exploiting the advantages of continuous
   illumination and spatial diversity. The main focuses and contributions
   of this paper are: 1) spectrally-contained continuous sequence sets with
   low correlation sidelobe levels are designed for the MCAS transmission
   so that the so-generated sequences meet the spectral containment
   restrictions and the weak correlations among the received echoes can be
   exploited to improve the target detection performance; and 2) a
   decentralized target parameter (position and velocity) determination
   method is investigated since its conventional centralized counterpart
   lacks robustness if there is no fusion center (FC) or the FC fails. This
   paper casts the target position determination problem based on the range
   measurements and the directions-of-arrival information (RMDI) as a set
   of decentralized optimization subproblems with consensus constraints
   imposed on the target position estimates of the receivers. Based on the
   alternating-direction method of multipliers (ADMM), we introduce the
   distributed position estimation algorithm to improve the local estimates
   of each receiver via local computation and information exchange with its
   neighbors. A similar method is also applied to obtain enhanced target
   velocity estimation. The effectiveness of the proposed MCAS signal
   processing techniques is verified using numerical examples.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{The Unified Partitioning-Aerosol phase Reaction (UNIPAR) model has been
   developed to predict the secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation
   through multiphase reactions. The model was evaluated with aromatic SOA
   data produced from the photooxidation of toluene and
   1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (135-TMB) under various concentrations of NOx and
   SO2 using an outdoor reactor (University of Florida Atmospheric
   PHotochemical Outdoor Reactor (UF-APHOR) chamber). When inorganic
   species (sulfate, ammonium and water) are present in aerosol, the
   prediction of both toluene SOA and 135-TMB SOA, in which the
   oxygen-to-carbon (O : C) ratio is lower than 0.62, are approached under
   the assumption of a complete organic/electrolyte-phase separation below
   a certain relative humidity. An explicit gas-kinetic model was employed
   to express gas-phase oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons. Gas-phase
   products are grouped based on their volatility (6 levels) and reactivity
   (5 levels) and exploited to construct the stoichiometric coefficient
   (alpha(i, j)) matrix, the set of parameters used to describe the
   concentrations of organic compounds in multiphase. Weighting of the
   alpha(i, j) matrix as a function of NOx improved the evaluation of NOx
   effects on aromatic SOA. The total amount of organic matter (OMT) is
   predicted by two modules in the UNI-PAR model: OMP by a partitioning
   process and OMAR by aerosol-phase reactions. The OMAR module predicts
   multiphase reactions of organic compounds, such as oligomerization,
   acid-catalyzed reactions, and organosulfate (OS) formation. The model
   reasonably simulates SOA formation under various aerosol acidities, NOx
   concentrations, humidities and temperatures. Furthermore, the OS
   fractions in the SOA predicted by the model were in good agreement with
   the experimentally measured OS fractions.}},

Volume = {{15}},
Pages = {{59-98}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Applications of non-linear kernel support vector machines (SVMs) to
   large data sets is seriously hampered by its excessive training time. We
   propose a modification, called the approximate extreme points support
   vector machine (AESVM), that is aimed at overcoming this burden. Our
   approach relies on conducting the SVM optimization over a carefully
   selected subset, called the representative set, of the training data
   set. We present analytical results that indicate the similarity of AESVM
   and SVM solutions. A linear time algorithm based on convex hulls and
   extreme points is used to compute the representative set in kernel
   space. Extensive computational experiments on nine data sets compared
   AESVM to LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2011), CVM (Tsang et al., 2005), BVM
   (Tsang et al., 2007), LASVM (Bordes et al., 2005), SVMperf (Joachims and
   Yu, 2009), and the random features method (Rahimi and Recht, 2007). Our
   AESVM implementation was found to train much faster than the other
   methods, while its classification accuracy was similar to that of LIBSVM
   in all cases. In particular, for a seizure detection data set, AESVM
   training was almost 500 times faster than LIBSVM and LASVM and 20 times
   faster than CVM and BVM. Additionally, AESVM also gave competitively
   fast classification times.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},

Volume = {{2}},

Pages = {{7509-7516}},
Abstract = {{A number of variables contribute to the electropolymerization, and the
   electrochemical properties, of electroactive polymers. However, few
   studies have attempted to acquire a unified understanding of the effects
   of all these variables, specifically as it relates to the capacitance of
   the material, as the number of experiments and resources required is
   large. Here, the effects of seven variables on the areal capacitance of
   the electropolymerized dimethyl derivative of
   poly(3,4-propylenedioxythiophene) (PProDOT-Me-2) films are analyzed
   utilizing a fractional factorial design of experiments to reduce the
   number of experiments an order of magnitude. From this analysis,
   PProDOT-Me-2 films were electropolymerized from an optimal set of
   variables to reproducibly afford films displaying the highest
   capacitances observed within this study. Devices were assembled from the
   optimized conditions, and the capacitance, energy, and power densities
   are reported in a framework that allows for meaningful comparison and
   understanding relative to commercially available supercapacitors. The
   supercapacitors fabricated in this study show promise towards being
   integrated as power sources for low-power, lightweight and flexible

Title = {{A Tensor-Product-Kernel Framework for Multiscale Neural Activity
   Decoding and Control}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Brain machine interfaces (BMIs) have attracted intense attention as a
   promising technology for directly interfacing computers or prostheses
   with the brain's motor and sensory areas, thereby bypassing the body.
   The availability of multiscale neural recordings including spike trains
   and local field potentials (LFPs) brings potential opportunities to
   enhance computational modeling by enriching the characterization of the
   neural system state. However, heterogeneity on data type (spike timing
   versus continuous amplitude signals) and spatiotemporal scale
   complicates the model integration of multiscale neural activity. In this
   paper, we propose a tensor-product-kernel-based framework to integrate
   the multiscale activity and exploit the complementary information
   available in multiscale neural activity. This provides a common
   mathematical framework for incorporating signals from different domains.
   The approach is applied to the problem of neural decoding and control.
   For neural decoding, the framework is able to identify the nonlinear
   functional relationship between the multiscale neural responses and the
   stimuli using general purpose kernel adaptive filtering. In a sensory
   stimulation experiment, the tensor-product-kernel decoder outperforms
   decoders that use only a single neural data type. In addition, an
   adaptive inverse controller for delivering electrical microstimulation
   patterns that utilizes the tensor-product kernel achieves promising
   results in emulating the responses to natural stimulation.}},

   exemplifies an efficient and cost-effective model organism with a vast
   repertoire of in vivo tools and techniques, all with high-throughput
   scalability and screening feasibility throughout its life cycle. Here we
   report tissue specific nanomaterial assessment through direct
   microtransfer into target tissues. We tested several nanomaterials with
   potential biomedical applications such as single-wall carbon nanotubes,
   multiwall carbon nanotubes, silver, gold, titanium dioxide, and iron
   oxide nanoparticles. Assessment of nanomaterial toxicity was conducted
   by evaluating progression through developmental morphological milestones
   in Drosophila. This cost-effective assessment method is amenable to
   high-throughput screening.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous research studies have evaluated whether distance learning is a
   viable alternative to traditional learning methods. These studies have
   generally made use of cross-sectional surveys for collecting data,
   comparing distance to traditional learners with intent to validate the
   former as a viable educational tool. Inherent fundamental differences
   between traditional and distance learning pedagogies, however, reduce
   the reliability of these comparative studies and constrain the validity
   of analyses resulting from this analytical approach. This article
   presents the results of a research project undertaken to analyze
   expectations and experiences of distance learners with their degree
   programs. Students were given surveys designed to examine factors
   expected to affect their overall value assessment of their distance
   learning program. Multivariate statistical analyses were used to analyze
   the correlations among variables of interest to support hypothesized
   relationships among them. Focusing on distance learners overcomes some
   of the limitations with assessments that compare off- and on-campus
   student experiences. Evaluation and modeling of distance learner
   responses on perceived value for money of the distance education they
   received indicate that the two most important influences are course
   communication requirements, which had a negative effect, and course
   logistical simplicity, which revealed a positive effect. Combined, these
   two factors accounted for approximately 47\% of the variability in
   perceived value for money of the educational program of sampled
   students. A detailed focus on comparing expectations with outcomes of
   distance learners complements the existing literature dominated by
   comparative studies of distance and nondistance learners.}},

Abstract = {{Solid phase epitaxial growth (SPEG) is a common technique used in the
   manufacturing processes of MOSFET technology. Even though a relatively
   broad knowledge is found for silicon, there is a greater uncertainty
   when it comes to germanium, which importance is arising in the last
   generation of microelectronic devices. To simulate this process, the
   need of a model which reproduces anisotropic growth and is able to
   detect and place twin defects becomes relevant, opening the possibility
   to simulate the interaction of different crystallographies, as it has
   been observed to be an important factor for some orientations,
   justifying by this mechanism experimental results.
   We present a Lattice Kinetic Monte Carlo (LKMC) model of Ge which is
   able to give an explanation of the different anisotropy effects in the
   recrystallization of substrate wafers through a defect formation
   formalism. An agreement between experimental observations and
   simulations is found by comparing regrowth velocities for different
   samples at different anneal conditions with LKMC simulations that
   consider twin defect formation for specific directions. Different
   regrowth velocities are found for distinct orientations of a solid phase
   epitaxial growth process within the annealed sample. (C) 2013 WILEY-VCH

Abstract = {{Twenty-three of the more recent and commonly used equilibrium local
   scour equations for cohesionless sediments were evaluated using compiled
   laboratory and field databases. This investigation assembled 569
   laboratory and 928 field data. A method for assessing the quality of the
   data was developed and applied to the data set. This procedure reduced
   the laboratory and field data to 441 and 791 values, respectively.
   Because the maturity of the scour hole at the time of measurement for
   the field data was unknown, they were only used to evaluate
   underprediction by the equations. A preliminary quality control
   screening of the equilibrium scour methods/equations reduced the number
   of equations from the initial 23 to 17. For this screening procedure the
   equations were used to compute scour depths for a wide, but practical,
   range of structure, flow, and sediment parameters. Those
   methods/equations yielding unreasonable (negative or extremely large)
   scour depths were eliminated from further consideration. The remaining
   17 methods/equations were then analyzed using both laboratory and field
   data. Plots of underprediction error versus total error for the
   laboratory data and underprediction error for field data versus total
   error for laboratory data along with error statistics calculations
   assisted in the ranking of the equations. Equations from previous
   publications were melded and slightly modified to provide the best
   performing equation in that it yields the least total error and close to
   the least under-prediction error of those tested. The new equation is
   termed the Sheppard/Melville (S/M) equation in this paper.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{24-34}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{The sediment erosion rate flume (SERF) device was computationally
   modeled using CD-adapco's Star-CCM+ at varying flow rates and sample
   roughnesses so that wall shear stresses could be evaluated during a
   piston-style erosion test. Shear stress data were matched between the
   model and data from previous physical tests. Pressure differential
   upstream and downstream from an eroding specimen displayed similar
   behavior during both physical and modeled tests in that as eroding
   sample roughness increased, pressure differential did not appear to
   change. A series of complicated bed configurations were added to the
   computational model to quantify the effects of blocking, chunking, or
   sample overadvancement during an erosion test. Results appeared to
   indicate that small deviations in sample geometry may have large effects
   on localized shear stresses. Another series of models was run to provide
   an explanation for the beginning of blocking or chunking as a result of
   shear stress development over a rough sample. Results showed that
   relatively large localized shear stresses may develop simply because of
   the introduction of roughness. Finally, results also indicated that the
   most conservative method for future testing is to keep the bottom edge
   of an eroding sample flush with a flume bottom.}},

Abstract = {{The insect-spread bacterial infection known as citrus greening or
   Huanglongbing (HLB) is a very destructive citrus disease and has caused
   massive losses in Florida's citrus industry. Early, easy, and less
   expensive HLB detection based on particular symptoms, such as starch
   accumulation in the citrus leaf would increase the chance of preventing
   the disease from being spread and causing more damage. The ability of
   narrow-band imaging and polarizing filters in detecting starch
   accumulation in symptomatic citrus leaf was evaluated in this study. A
   custom-made image acquisition system was developed for this purpose in
   which leaf samples were illuminated with polarized light using
   narrow-band high-power LEDs at 400 nm and 591 nm, and the reflectance
   was measured by two monochrome cameras. Two polarizing filters were
   mounted in perpendicular directions in front of the cameras so that each
   camera acquired an image with reflected light in only one direction
   (parallel or perpendicular to the illumination polarization). Four
   groups of textural features, including gray, local binary pattern, local
   similarity pattern, and gray-level co-occurrence features, were
   extracted and ranked using several feature selection methods. Seven
   classifiers (support vector machine, linear, naive Bayes linear,
   quadratic, naive Bayes quadratic, Mahalanobis, and k nearest neighbor)
   were evaluated, and the best classifiers and sets of features were
   selected based on their accuracy. The leaf samples were collected from
   the `Hamlin' and `Valencia' varieties of citrus. Three classes of
   samples (magnesium-deficient, HLB-positive zinc-deficient, and
   HLB-negative zinc-deficient) were considered in the classification
   process to confirm the starch detection ability of the system. Overall
   average accuracies of 93.1\% and 89.6\% in HLB detection were obtained
   for the `Hamlin' and `Valencia' varieties, respectively, using a
   step-by-step classification method The results of this study showed that
   the starch accumulation in HLB-symptomatic leaves rotated the
   polarization planar of light at 591 nm, and this property can be
   effectively used in a fast and inexpensive HLB detection system.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale: Cone Beam Computed Tomography imaging has become increasingly
   important in many fields of interventional therapies. Objective: Lung
   navigation study which is an uncommon soft tissue approach. Methods: As
   no effective organ radiation dose levels were available for this kind of
   Cone Beam Computed Tomography application we simulated in our DynaCT
   (Siemens AG, Forchheim, Germany) suite 2 measurements including 3D
   acquisition and again for 3D acquisition and 4 endobronchial navigation
   maneuvers under fluoroscopy towards a nodule after the 8th segmentation
   in the right upper lobe over a total period of 20 minutes (min). These
   figures reflect the average complexity and time in our experience. We
   hereby describe the first time the exact protocol of lung navigation by
   a Cone Beam Computed Tomography approach. Measurement: The hereby first
   time measured body radiation doses in that approach showed very
   promising numbers between 0,98-1,15mSv giving specific lung radiation
   doses of 0,42-0,38 mSv. Main results: These figures are comparable or
   even better to other lung navigation systems. Cone Beam Computed
   Tomography offers some unique features for lung interventionists as a
   realtime 1-step navigation system in an open structure feasible for
   endobronchial and transcutaneous approach. Conclusions: Due to this low
   level of radiation exposure Cone Beam Computed Tomography is expected to
   attract interventionists interested in using and guiding endobronchial
   lesions.}},

Abstract = {{Compact intracloud discharges (CIDs) are sources of the powerful, often
   isolated radio pulses emitted by thunderstorms. The VLF-LF radio pulses
   are called narrow bipolar pulses (NBPs). It is still not clear how CIDs
   are produced, but two categories of theoretical models that have
   previously been considered are the Transmission Line (TL) model and the
   Relativistic Runaway Electron Avalanche-Extensive Air Showers (RREA-EAS)
   model. In this paper, we perform numerical calculations of RREA-EASs for
   various electric field configurations inside thunderstorms. The results
   of these calculations are compared to results from the other models and
   to the experimental data. Our analysis shows that different theoretical
   models predict different fundamental characteristics for CIDs.
   Therefore, many previously published properties of CIDs are highly model
   dependent. This is because of the fact that measurements of the
   radiation field usually provide information about the current moment of
   the source, and different physical models with different discharge
   currents could have the same current moment. We have also found that
   although the RREA-EAS model could explain the current moments of CIDs,
   the required electric fields in the thundercloud are rather large and
   may not be realistic. Furthermore, the production of NBPs from RREA-EAS
   requires very energetic primary cosmic ray particles, not observed in
   nature. If such ultrahigh-energy particles were responsible for NBPs,
   then they should be far less frequent than is actually observed.

   polymers for solar energy harvesting and storage applications}},
Journal = {{POLYMER CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},

Pages = {{2363-2369}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes the synthesis, electrochemical and photophysical
   properties of two poly(fluorene-co-thiophene)-based polymers featuring
   pendant Ru(II) polypyridyl-based ionic transition metal complexes. These
   systems combine long-lived excited states of the Ru(II) chromophores and
   the large optical cross-sections of the conjugated backbones,
   potentially allowing for polymer-assisted solar radiation-harvesting and
   storage functions via ultrafast energy and charge transfer processes.
   Modified azide-alkyne ``click{''} cycloaddition chemistry conditions are
   demonstrated as an effective approach to obtain quantitatively
   functionalized conjugated polymer-ionic transition metal complex
   assemblies. Introduction of variable fractions of electron-rich
   thiophene units into these architectures induces a bathochromic shift in
   the polyfluorene absorption maxima, while simultaneously stabilizing the
   oxidized states of the conjugated scaffolds, as determined by
   electrochemical and in situ spectroelectrochemical experiments. The
   hybrid assemblies exhibit ultrafast energy flow (700 fs to 4.8 ps) and
   photoinduced charge-separation (1.8-2.0 ps) between the conjugated
   backbone and the Ru(II) moieties. Notably, the chemical composition of
   the main-chain repeat unit determines the dominant pathway for decay of
   the conjugated backbone excited states with the fraction of electron
   transfer increasing from 25\% to 75\% upon incorporation of an
   additional thiophene heterocycle.}},

   photochemically aged under natural sunlight}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1517-1525}},
Abstract = {{Wood-burning aerosol produced under smoldering conditions was
   photochemically aged with different relative humidity (RH) and NOx
   conditions using a 104 m(3) dual outdoor chamber under natural sunlight.
   Light absorption of organic carbon (OC) was measured over the course of
   photooxidation using a UV-visible spectrometer connected to an
   integrating sphere. At high RH, the color decayed rapidly. NOx slightly
   prolonged the color of wood smoke, suggesting that NOx promotes the
   formation of chromophores via secondary processes. Overall, the mass
   absorption cross section (integrated between 280 and 600 nm) of OC
   increased by 11-54\% (except high RH) in the morning and then gradually
   decreased by 19-68\% in the afternoon. This dynamic change in light
   absorption of wood-burning OC can be explained by two mechanisms:
   chromophore formation and sunlight bleaching. To investigate the effect
   of chemical transformation on light absorption, wood smoke particles
   were characterized using various spectrometers. The intensity of
   fluorescence, which is mainly related to polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs), rapidly decreased with time, indicating the
   potential bleaching of PAHs. A decline of levoglucosan concentrations
   evinced the change of primary organic aerosol with time. The aerosol
   water content measured by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed
   that wood-burning aerosol became less hygroscopic as photooxidation
   proceeded. A similar trend in light absorption changes has been observed
   in ambient smoke aerosol originating from the 2012 County Line wildfire
   in Florida. We conclude that the biomass-burning OC becomes less light
   absorbing after 8-9 h sunlight exposure compared to fresh wood-burning
   OC.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY}},

Volume = {{161}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{C107-C114}},
Abstract = {{Copper is commonly regarded to be immune to corrosion in deaerated
   deionized electrolytes. The present work shows that, in the absence of
   hydrogen, copper will corrode on the order of 1 nm/day in deionized
   water with an O-2 concentration on the order of, or less than, 1 ppb.
   While a corrosion rate of this magnitude can normally be neglected, it
   may be catastrophic for nanoscale copper structures utilized in emerging
   applications to enhance energy transport at the solid-electrolyte
   interface, such as in cooling advance electronics. This conclusion is
   supported by a set of experimental and analytical studies that encompass
   impedance spectroscopy, slow-scan linear sweep voltammetry,
   thermodynamic calculations for the environment under study, and kinetic
   simulations. The studies provide a comprehensive insight on details of
   the corrosion mechanism for copper in deaerated water. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{Dynamic simulation models can increase research efficiency and improve
   risk management of agriculture. Crop models are still little used for
   sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) because the lack of understanding of their
   capabilities and limitations, lack of experience in calibrating them,
   difficulties in evaluating and using models, and a general lack of model
   credibility. This paper describes the biophysics and shows a statistical
   evaluation of a simple sugarcane processbased model coupled with a
   routine for model calibration. Classical crop model approaches were used
   as a framework.f or this model, and fitted algorithms for simulating
   sucrose accumulation and leaf development driven by a source-sink
   approach were proposed. The model was evaluated using data from five
   growing seasons at four locations in Brazil, where crops received
   adequate nutrients and good weed control. Thirteen of the 27 parameters
   were optimized using a Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation
   algorithm using the leave-one-out cross-validation technique. Model
   predictions were evaluated using measured data of leaf area index, stalk
   and aerial dry mass, and sucrose content, using bias, root mean squared
   error, modeling efficiency, correlation coefficient and agreement index.
   The model well simulated the sugarcane crop in Southern Brazil, using
   the parameterization reported here. Predictions were best for stalk dry
   mass, followed by leaf area index and then sucrose content in stalk
   fresh mass.}},

Abstract = {{Since the discovery of steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP),
   it has been used in many fields. Numerous studies suggest that there
   exist three SSVEP neural networks in different frequency bands. An
   obvious phenomenon has been observed, that the amplitude and phase of
   SSVEP can be modulated by a cognitive task. Previous works have studied
   this modulation on separately activated SSVEP neural networks by a
   cognitive task. If two or more SSVEP neural networks are activated
   simultaneously in the process of a cognitive task, is the modulation on
   different SSVEP neural networks the same? In this study, two different
   SSVEP neural networks were activated simultaneously by two different
   frequency flickers, with a working memory task irrelevant to the
   flickers being conducted at the same time. The modulated SSVEP waves
   were compared with each other and to those only under one flicker in
   previous studies. The comparison results show that the cognitive task
   can modulate different SSVEP neural networks with a similar style.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the findings of an investigation in which the finite

   modeled using a commercially avaialable finite element analysis software
   and the inputs for the mechanical and thermal properties of early-age
   concrete based on values obtained experimentally from a concrete mixture
   used in the construction of mass concrete in Florida. It was shown that,
   for insulation with a given thermal resistance, as the size of concrete
   placement increases, greater reduction of the temperature differential
   can be achieved by simply using additional layers of polystyrene foam or
   insulating blankets. The study also found that the attained tensile
   strength of concrete should be considered before the formwork and
   accompanying insulation used in mass concrete applications are removed
   to ensure that the stresses that result from the sudden cooling of the
   concrete surface are sufficiently lower, thereby reducing the likelihood

Abstract = {{This work describes the synthesis and testing of a novel environmental
   sorbent that combines the advantages of biochar, chitosan, and
   zerovalent iron (ZVI). Chitosan was used as a dispersing and soldering
   reagent to attach fine ZVI particles onto bamboo biochar surfaces.
   Characterization of the resulted ZVI-biochar composites (BBCF) indicated
   that chitosan effectively soldered the iron particles onto carbonaceous
   surfaces within the biochar pore networks. The BBCF showed enhanced
   ability to sorb heavy metals (Pb(II), Cr(VI), and As(V)), phosphate (P),
   and methylene blue (MB) from aqueous solutions. The removal of Pb(II),
   Cr(VI), and MB by the biochar-supported ZVI was mainly controlled by
   both the reduction and surface adsorption mechanisms. Removal of anionic
   contaminants (As(V) and P) was likely controlled by electrostatic
   attraction with the iron particles on the BBCF surfaces. An additional
   benefit is that the contaminant-laden BBCF could be removed from aqueous
   solution easily by magnetic attraction. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Fuel blends that contain biodiesel are known to produce greater NOx
   (nitrogen oxide) emissions in diesel engine exhaust than regular diesel,
   and this is one of the key barriers to the wider adoption of biodiesel
   as an alternative fuel. In this study, a water-containing ABE
   (acetone-butanol-ethanol) solution, which simulates products that are
   produced from biomass fermentation without dehydration processing, was
   tested as a biodiesel-diesel blend additive to lower NOx emissions from
   diesel engines. The energy efficiency and the PM (particulate matter)
   and PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) emissions were investigated
   and compared under various operating conditions. Although biodiesel had
   greater NOx emissions, the blends, that contained 25\% of the
   water-containing ABE solution had significantly lower NOx (4.30-30.7\%),
   PM (10.9-63.1\%), and PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) emissions
   (26.7-67.6\%) than the biodiesel diesel blends and regular diesel,
   respectively. In addition, the energy efficiency of this new blend was
   0372-7.88\% higher with respect to both the biodiesel-diesel blends and
   regular diesel. Because dehydration and surfactant addition are not
   necessary, the application of ABE-biodiesel-diesel blends can simplify
   fuel production processes, reduce energy consumption, and lower
   pollutant emissions, meaning that the ABE-biodiesel-diesel blend is a
   promising green fuel. 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Environmental Sustainability Through a Life Cycle Assessment Module}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{103}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{154-181}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Incorporating environmental sustainability (ES) into engineering
   education is vital to both individual engineering students' success and
   to the profession as a whole. This study explores attitudes,
   conceptions, and misconceptions about ES that students bring to the
   classroom. A promising framework of design-based research is applied to
   gauge how instructional innovation can impact student attitudes,
   conceptions, and misconceptions.
   Purpose
   Two questions guided this research: What knowledge and attitudes about
   ES, particularly those pertaining to engineering, do first-year
   engineering students have? How can an engineering module focused on life
   cycle assessment in a first-year engineering course affect students'
   conceptual understanding to prepare them to develop a robust
   appreciation of environmental issues and ES in engineering?
   Design/Method
   A quantitative research design in the context of a comparative
   design-based research study was utilized to examine first-year
   engineering students' environmental awareness coming into the program
   and changes in their conceptions of ES following their participation in
   a module that focused on life cycle assessment (LCA).
   Results/Conclusion
   Following the participation in the LCA module, the intervention was able
   to address certain misconceptions and support students' shift to deeper
   understanding about ES. Students' perceptions regarding the complexity
   of LCA did not change. Including multifaceted issues such as LCA in the
   teaching of engineering students seems beneficial.}},

Abstract = {{It is known that BCC Mg-Li alloys offer the opportunity to realize both
   high specific strength and good ductility in a light weight alloy. The
   commonest addition to this system is Al due to its solid
   solution-strengthening ability. This system is also known to precipitate
   a potent metastable phase that subsequently transitions to the
   equilibrium AlLi phase. There are other systems, Zn, Cd, and In, which
   are also known to precipitate a phase that is similar to the AlLi phase.
   Of these additions, the phase-evolution characteristics associated with
   adding In to Mg-Li and Mg-Li-Al alloys are largely unknown. This article
   seeks to understand the phase transformation, microstructural evolution,
   and mechanical behavior of In additions by systematically studying
   Mg-Li-In in contrast to Mg-Li-Al and Mg-Li-Al-In. This study represents
   an initial investigation of the Mg-Li-In system, while simultaneously
   determining Indium's potential as a microalloying addition. It was found
   that in the compositional ranges under investigation, a metastable phase
   does form in each system, and at longer aging times, In3Li13 is found to
   precipitate. Commentary and insight are also provided with respect to
   precipitate nucleation and coarsening behavior. (C) The Minerals, Metals

Abstract = {{Future drag-free missions for space-based experiments in gravitational
   physics require a Gravitational Reference Sensor with extremely
   demanding sensing and disturbance reduction requirements. A
   configuration with two cubical sensors is the current baseline for the
   Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and has reached a high level
   of maturity. Nevertheless, several promising concepts have been proposed
   with potential applications beyond LISA and are currently investigated
   at HEPL, Stanford, and EADS Astrium, Germany. The general motivation is
   to exploit the possibility of achieving improved disturbance reduction,
   and ultimately understand how low acceleration noise can be pushed with
   a realistic design for future mission. In this paper, we discuss
   disturbance reduction requirements for LISA and beyond, describe four
   different payload concepts, compare expected strain sensitivities in the
   ``low-frequency{''} region of the frequency spectrum, dominated by
   acceleration noise, and ultimately discuss advantages and disadvantages
   of each of those concepts in achieving disturbance reduction for
   space-based detectors beyond LISA. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The unprecedented growth and influence of Social Network Sites (SNSs)
   have opened the opportunity for researchers to explore a large amount of
   social and behavioral data. The heterogeneity of SNSs further sparks
   research innovations to develop methods and applications that integrate
   resources and offer more seamless services across SNSs. Specifically,
   aiming at the integration of social relationship data, a much less
   studied subject, we propose a peer-to-peer architecture, namely P2P-iSN,
   to integrate the heterogeneous SNSs. The P2P-iSN allows users from
   heterogeneous SNSs to communicate without involving the SNS they have
   registered with. Under this architecture, we propose a Global
   Relationship Model (GRM) to capture the relationship strength between
   users and then develop a searching mechanism, namely i-Search, to find
   the optimal social path between any two users who are meaningfully
   connected in heterogeneous SNSs. We evaluate the performance of P2P-iSN
   and show that our P2P-iSN can effectively support many future
   applications such as improved trust/reputation metrics and integrated
   content-sharing. With the proposed P2P-iSN, SNS developers can design
   more effective user-centric SNS applications.}},

   complexities of the evolutionary processes. Model results from both
   geometries show a clear life cycle of growth and deterioration in a
   diversion that experiences relative sea level rise and, under certain
   combinations of relative sea level rise, depth of receiving waters and
   sediment discharge rate, situations in which a subaerial platform will
   never form. A comparison of subaerial deposits in larger versus smaller
   diversions, assuming the same total sediment discharge in both cases,
   reveals that the total subaerial land area for the larger diversions is
   substantially greater than the sum of the two volumes of the smaller
   diversions. Model results have been used to illustrate, through
   examples, the effect of bottom slope and sea level rise on diversion
   performance. Recommendations have been made for the selection
   (quantification) of diversion parameters to be used in the models. These
   include annual sediment input, proportion of sediment retained in the
   diversion deposit, sediment bulking factor, foreset slope, and
   subsidence rate. Other required input parameters are considered to be
   known, namely, average diversion water discharge, initial depth of
   receiving waters, bottom slope, deposit angle or width, and future sea
   level rise. We also include general recommendations for selection and
   utilization of diversion sites.}},

Abstract = {{The authors report an investigation of the effect of different doses of
   5 MeV proton irradiation on circular-shaped AlGaN/GaN high electron
   mobility transistors. The degradation of saturation drain current
   (I-DSS) was minimal up to an irradiation dose of 2 x 10 13 cm(-2). By
   comparison, a dose of 2 x 10 14 cm(-2) dose produced a 12.5\% reduction
   of IDSS and 9.2\% increase of sheet resistance. In addition, the
   threshold voltage showed larger positive shifts for 2 x 10 14 cm(-2)
   dose compared to 2 x 10 13 cm(-2), and both of these doses produced
   showed larger shifts for smaller gate to drain distances. Increases of
   39.8\% and 47.1\%, respectively, in the breakdown voltage for 6 and 10
   mu m drain to gate distances (L-GD) was observed and was attributed to
   the creation of a virtual gate at the AlGaN/GaN interface due to the
   irradiation, which reduced the peak electric field at the drain side of
   the gate edge. (C) 2014 American Vacuum Society.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic photocatalysts were successfully prepared by coating titania
   silica (TiO2 SiO2) on cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) nanoparticles. A simple
   organic acid precursor method was employed to prepare the magnetic part,
   while the TiO2-SiO2 was synthesized and coated onto CoFe2O4 by the sol
   gel technique. Controlling the modification process of TiO2-SiO2 with
   CoFe2O4 nanoparticles is a key factor for obtaining appropriate
   catalytic performance. Under optimized conditions, a core-shell
   structure could be obtained in which CoFe2O4 is a core while TiO2-SiO2
   forms a shell. The current photocatalyst exhibits remarkable catalytic
   activity for the degradation of methylene blue dye in water under UV
   irradiation. It was demonstrated that the catalyst could remove as high
   as 98.3\% of the organic dye in just 40 min. The degradation efficiency
   was found to depend essentially on initial dye concentration, solution
   pH and the catalyst loading. The as-synthesized catalyst was
   characterized by different techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD),
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform
   infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherm.
   The photocatalyst could be removed from the reaction mixture and its
   recyclability remains effective and active after six cycles. (C) 2013

   slightly distorted crystal morphology of larger particle sizes. DSC
   thermograms evinced that the exothermic peak temperature of mullite was
   shifted to the lower value with M3+ ion insertion. The photoluminescence
   spectra were studied for mullite samples, and it was found that the
   intensity of the emission spectra was affected by the M3+ ion type. It
   was found that, Y3+ doped mullite achieved the minimum dielectric loss

Volume = {{466}},
Pages = {{547-555}},

Abstract = {{An understanding of antibiotic hydrolysis rates is important for
   predicting their environmental persistence. Hydrolysis rates and
   Arrhenius constants were determined as a function of pH and temperature
   for three common beta-lactam antibiotics, ampicillin, cefalotin, and
   cefoxitin. Antibiotic hydrolysis rates at pH 4-9 at 25 degrees C, 50
   degrees C, and 60 degrees C were quantified, and degradation products
   were identified. The three antibiotics hydrolyzed under ambient
   conditions (pH 7 and 25 degrees C); half-lives ranged from 5.3 to 27 d.
   Base-catalyzed hydrolysis rates were significantly greater than
   acid-catalyzed and neutral pH hydrolysis rates. Hydrolysis rates
   increased 2.5- to 3.9-fold for a 10 degrees C increase in temperature.
   Based on the degradation product masses found, the likely functional
   groups that underwent hydrolysis were lactam, ester, carbamate, and
   amide moieties. Many of the proposed products resulting from the
   hydrolysis of ampicillin, cefalotin, and cefoxitin likely have reduced
   antimicrobial activity because many products contained a hydrated lactam
   ring. The results of this research demonstrate that beta-lactam
   antibiotics hydrolyzed under ambient pH and temperature conditions.
   Degradation of beta-lactam antibiotics will likely occur over several
   weeks in most surface waters and over several days in more alkaline
   systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{On remote measurements of lightning return stroke peak currents}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{135}},
Pages = {{306-313}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Return-stroke peak current is one of the most important measures of
   lightning intensity needed in different areas of atmospheric electricity
   research. It can be estimated from the corresponding electric or
   magnetic radiation field peak. Electric fields of 89 strokes in
   lightning flashes triggered using the rocket-and-wire technique at Camp
   Blanding (CB), Florida, were recorded at the Lightning Observatory in
   Gainesville, about 45 km from the lightning channel. Lightning
   return-stroke peak currents were estimated from the measured electric
   field peaks using the empirical formula of Rakov et al. (1992) and the
   field-to-current conversion equation based on the transmission line
   model (Uman and McLain, 1969). These estimates, along with peak currents
   reported by the U.S. National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN), were
   compared with the ground-truth data, currents directly measured at the
   lightning channel base. The empirical formula, based on data for 28
   triggered-lightning strokes acquired at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC),
   tends to overestimate peak currents, whereas the NLDN-reported peak
   currents are on average underestimates. The field-to-current conversion
   equation based on the transmission line model gives the best match with
   directly measured peak currents for return-stroke speeds between c/2 and
   2c/3 (1.5 and 2 x 10(8) m/s, respectively). Possible reasons for the
   discrepancy in the peak current estimates from the empirical formula and
   the ground-truth data include an error in the field calibration factor,
   difference in the typical return-stroke speeds at CB and at the KSC
   (considered here to be the most likely reason), and limited sample
   sizes, particularly for the KSC data. A new empirical formula,
   I=-0.66-0.028rE, based on data for 89 strokes in lightning flashes
   triggered at CB, is derived. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{141-155}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel generative model for time series based on
   the Kalman filter algorithm in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS)
   using the conditional embedding operator. The end result is a nonlinear
   model that quantifies the hidden state uncertainty and propagates its
   probability distribution forward as in the Kalman algorithm. The
   embedded dynamics can be described by the estimated conditional
   embedding operator constructed directly from the training measurement
   data. Using this operator as the counterpart of the state transition
   matrix, we reformulate the Kalman filter algorithm in RKHS. For the
   state model, the hidden states are the estimated embeddings of the
   measurement distribution, while the measurement model serves to connect
   the estimated measurement embeddings with the current mapped
   measurements in the RKHS. This novel algorithm is applied to noisy
   time-series estimation and prediction, and simulation results show that
   it outperforms other existing algorithms. In addition, improvements are
   proposed to reduce the size of the operator and reduce the computation
   complexity.}},

Abstract = {{The paper considers the problem of scheduling packets in wireless
   broadcast systems under uncertainty with the conditional value-at-risk
   (CVaR) constraints. In such systems, a server periodically transmits a
   stream of packets over a broadcast channel. The client that needs to
   access the data, tunes in to the channel and waits for the next packet.
   This allows one to serve a large number of clients in an efficient way
   and also keep clients' location secret. We formulate and solve two
   alternative stochastic optimization problems that minimize the
   transmission time subject to CVaR constraints. Our results indicate that
   it is possible to derive an analytical solution to the problems in
   certain cases of practical interest. We also propose a methodology to
   obtain numerical solutions for the general case.}},

Abstract = {{The newly emerged vehicular communication network is seen as a key
   technology for solving increasingly serious vehicular traffic congestion
   and improving road safety. New applications of vehicular networks are
   also emerging at the same time. Predicting vehicular staying time is
   vital to both solving the vehicular system problem and building
   efficient vehicular networking. How much the vehicular staying duration
   of visits to different areas can be predicted is still an open and
   unsolved problem. In this paper, we use real vehicular traces in Beijing
   and Shanghai to explore the limit of predictability of the vehicular
   visiting time in different areas in large cities, and we analyze the
   impact of different precision and slot time on predictability. We
   conclude that using a proper time slot is an efficient way of
   prediction, and a higher predictability can be achieved if the
   requirement for precision is reduced. Among all the cases that we
   studied, we find the predictability to be 76.3\% for Beijing and 82.5\%
   for Shanghai in the case with the smallest slot time and reasonable
   requirements for precision.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new method for quantifying uncertainty in the
   predictions of a nanomaterial computational model to account for
   variability in the constituent nanostructure properties and
   characterization measurements. The stiffness of a buckypaper-polymer
   composite is predicted using a micromechanics model. The model requires
   from the user as inputs the nanostructure properties, including the
   diameter, length, and curvature distribution of the carbon nanotubes
   which shows large variability. The current characterization techniques
   used to describe these dimensions are subject to considerable
   measurement error. We propose a constrained nonlinear programming
   approach for quantification of raw material variability and its impact
   on the property prediction of buckypaper-polymer composites. The
   uncertainty quantification method is useful for decision making to
   predict probability that the quality characteristic of the final part
   will satisfy design constraints. A case study based on data from a real
   buckypaper manufacturing process was used to illustrate the approach. It
   is shown that modeling the correlation between nanostructure properties
   using a multivariate distribution rather than independent univariate
   distributions is important to accurately quantify the effect of these
   properties on the final-part property.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates a products and vehicles scheduling problem in a
   two-stage supply chain environment, where jobs first need to be
   processed on the serial batching machines of multiple manufacturers
   distributed in various geographic zones and then transported by vehicles
   to a customer for further processing. The size and processing time of
   jobs are varying with the difference of types, and each batch takes a
   setup time before being processed. The problem of minimizing the
   makespan is formalized as a mixed integer programming model and proved
   to be NP-hard. In addition, the structural properties and lower bound of
   the problem are analyzed and inferred. Then a modified gravitational
   search algorithm (MGSA) is proposed to solve the problem. In the
   developed MGSA, several improvement strategies and the batching
   mechanism DP-H are introduced. The effectiveness and efficiency of the
   proposed MGSA are demonstrated and compared with a particle swarm
   optimization (PSO) algorithm and a genetic algorithm (GA). Besides, the
   error ratios between the lower bound and the best found solutions are
   reported. The experimental results indicate that the proposed MGSA is
   more robust and outperforms PSO and GA on the studied two-stage supply
   chain scheduling problem.}},

Abstract = {{Mineralized collagen composites are of interest because they have the
   potential to provide a bone-like scaffold that stimulates the natural
   processes of resorption and remodeling. Working towards this goal, our
   group has previously shown that the nanostructure of bone can be
   reproduced using a polymer-induced liquid-precursor (PILP) process,
   which enables intrafibrillar mineralization of collagen with
   hydroxyapatite to be achieved. This prior work used polyaspartic acid
   (pASP), a simple mimic for acidic non-collagenous proteins, to generate
   nanodroplets/nanoparticles of an amorphous mineral precursor which can
   infiltrate the interstices of type-I collagen fibrils. In this study we
   show that osteopontin (OPN) can similarly serve as a process-directing
   agent for the intrafibrillar mineralization of collagen, even though OPN
   is generally considered a mineralization inhibitor. We also found that
   inclusion of OPN in the mineralization process promotes the interaction
   of mouse marrow-derived osteoclasts with PILP-remineralized bone that
   was previously demineralized, as measured by actin ring formation. While
   osteoclast activation occurred when pASP was used as the
   process-directing agent, using OPN resulted in a dramatic effect on
   osteoclast activation, presumably because of the inherent
   arginine-glycine-aspartate acid ligands of OPN. By capitalizing on the
   multifunctionality of OPN, these studies may lead the way to producing
   biomimetic bone substitutes with the capability of tailorable
   bioresorption rates. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{With the advent of brain computer interfaces based on real-time fMRI
   (rtfMRI-BCI), the possibility of performing neurofeedback based on brain
   hemodynamics has become a reality. In the early stage of the development
   of this field, studies have focused on the volitional control of
   activity in circumscribed brain regions. However, based on the
   understanding that the brain functions by coordinated activity of
   spatially distributed regions, there have recently been further
   developments to incorporate real-time feedback of functional
   connectivity and spatio-temporal patterns of brain activity. The present
   article reviews the principles of rtfMRI neurofeedback, its
   applications, benefits and limitations. A special emphasis is given to
   the discussion of novel developments that have enabled the use of this
   methodology to achieve self-regulation of the functional connectivity
   between different brain areas and of distributed brain networks,
   anticipating new and exciting applications for cognitive neuroscience
   and for the potential alleviation of neuropsychiatric disorders. (C)

Abstract = {{Lignin nanotubes (LNTs) synthesized from the aromatic plant cell wall
   polymer lignin in a sacrificial alumina membrane template have as useful
   features their flexibility, ease functionalization due to the
   availability of many functional groups, label-free detection by
   autofluorescence, and customizable optical properties. In this report we
   show that the physicochemical properties of LNTs can be varied over a
   wide range to match requirements for specific applications by using
   lignin with different subunit composition, a function of plant species
   and genotype, and by choosing the lignin isolation method (thioglycolic
   acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid (Klason), sodium hydroxide lignin),
   which influences the size and reactivity of the lignin fragments.
   Cytotoxicity studies with human He La cells showed that concentrations
   of up to 90 mg/mL are tolerated, which is a 10-fold higher concentration
   than observed for single- or multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs).
   Confocal microscopy imaging revealed that all LNT formulations enter He
   La cells without auxiliary agents and that LNTs made from NaOH-lignin
   penetrate the cell nucleus. We further show that DNA can adsorb to LNTs.
   Consequently, exposure of He La cells to LNTs coated with DNA encoding
   the green fluorescent protein (GFP) leads to transfection and expression
   of GFP. The highest transfection efficiency was obtained with LNTs made
   from NaOH-lignin due to a combination of high DNA binding capacity and
   DNA delivery directly into the nucleus. These combined features of LNTs
   make LNTs attractive as smart delivery vehicles of DNA without the
   cytotoxicity associated with CNTs or the immunogenicity of viral
   vectors.}},

Abstract = {{Reliable channel estimation and effective interference cancellation are
   essential for enhancing the performance of
   multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) underwater acoustic communication
   (UAC) systems. In this paper, an efficient user-parameter-free Bayesian
   approach, referred to as sparse learning via iterative minimization
   (SLIM), is presented. SLIM provides good channel estimation performance
   along with reduced computational complexity compared to iterative
   adaptive approach (IAA). Moreover, RELAX-BLAST, which is a linear
   minimum mean-squared error (MMSE)-based symbol detection scheme, is
   implemented efficiently by making use of the conjugate gradient (CG)
   method and diagonalization properties of circulant matrices. The
   proposed algorithm requires only simple fast Fourier transform (FFT)
   operations and facilitates parallel implementations. These MIMO UAC
   techniques are evaluated using both simulated and in-water experimental
   examples. The 2008 Surface Processes and Acoustic Communications
   Experiment (SPACE08) experimental results show that the proposed MIMO
   UAC schemes can enjoy almost error-free performance even under severe
   ocean environments.}},

Abstract = {{Inert matrix fuels based on magnesium oxide (MgO) as the inert phase
   have been of historic interest due to its high thermal conductivity.
   Minor actinide-bearing phases possessing an A(2)B(2)O(7) pyrochlore
   structure are also believed to contain a range of favorable attributes,
   suggesting a possible pairing with MgO to yield a high performance inert
   matrix fuel. The thermal diffusivity, heat capacity, and thermal
   expansion of MgO-Nd2Zr2O7 composites were measured from room temperature
   to 1273 K, where the MgO phase content was varied from 40 to 70 volume
   percent. The thermal conductivity of each composition was calculated
   using these results and then compared to widely employed methods to
   approximate the thermal conductivity of composite materials based upon
   the properties of the constituent phases. Results suggest that use of
   either a rule of mixtures or geometric mean approximation for the
   thermal conductivity of composite systems such as this one would be
   subject to significant uncertainties when the constituent properties
   widely differ. A sigmoidal average of the upper and lower
   Hashin-Shtrikman bounds was found to be in good agreement with the
   thermal conductivity of the composites as determined experimentally. (C)

Abstract = {{Mechanical property data for brain tissue are needed to understand the
   biomechanics of neurological disorders and response of the brain to
   different mechanical and surgical forces. Most studies have
   characterized mechanical behavior of brain tissues over large regions or
   classified tissue properties for either gray or white matter regions
   only. In this study, spatially heterogeneous viscoelastic properties of
   ex vivo rat brain tissue slices were measured in different anatomical
   regions including the cerebral cortex, caudate/putamen, and hippocampus
   using an optical coherence tomography (OCT) indentation system. Cell
   viability was also tested to observe neuronal degeneration and
   morphological changes in tissue slices and provide a proper timeline for
   mechanical tests. Shear modulus was estimated by fitting normalized
   deformation data (D/t(i)), which was defined as the ratio of deformation
   depth (D) to initial thickness of the tissue slice (t(i)), to a
   viscoelastic finite element model. The estimated shear modulus decayed
   nonlinearly over 10 min in each anatomical region, and the range of
   instantaneous to equilibrium shear modulus was 3.8-0.54 kPa in the
   cerebral cortex, 1.4-0.27 kPa in the hippocampus and 1.0-0.17 kPa in the
   caudate/putamen. Although these regions are all gray matter structures,
   their measured mechanical properties were significantly different.
   Accurate measurement of interregional variations in mechanical
   properties will contribute to improved understanding organ-level
   structural parameters and regional differential susceptibility to
   deformation injury within CNS tissues. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Untangling drivers of systems and uncertainty for species distribution
   models (SDMs) is important to provide reliable predictions that are
   useful for conservation campaigns. This is particularly true for species
   whose habitat is threatened by climate change that enhances the
   uncertainty in future species distributions. Global sensitivity and
   uncertainty analyses (GSUA) is a robust method to globally investigate
   the uncertainty of SDMs and the importance of species distributions'
   drivers in space and time.
   Here we apply GSUA to MAXENT that is one of the popular presence-only
   SDMs. We consider the Snowy Plover (Charadrius alexandrinus nivosus)
   (SP) in Florida that is a shorebird whose habitat is affected by sea
   level rise due to climate change. The importance of intrinsic and
   exogenous input factors to the uncertainty of the species distribution
   is evaluated for MAXENT. GSUA is applied for three projections of the
   habitat (2006, 2060, and 2100) according to the A1B sea level rise
   scenario. The large land cover variation determines a moderate decrease
   in habitat suitability in 2060 and 2100 prospecting a low risk of
   decline for the SP. The regularization parameter for the environmental
   features, the uncertainty into the classification of salt-marsh,
   transitional marsh, and ocean beach, and the maximum number of
   iterations for the model training are in this order the most important
   input factors for the average habitat suitability. These results are
   related to the SP but, in general MAXENT appears as a very non-linear
   model where uncertainty mostly derives from the interactions among input
   factors.
   The uncertainty of the output is a species-specific variable. Thus, GSUA
   need be performed for each case considering local exogenous input
   factors of the model. GSUA allows quantitative informed
   species-management decisions by providing scenarios with controlled
   uncertainty and confidence over factors' importance that can be used by
   resource managers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The physics of water desorption from a lithium bromide (LiBr) solution
   flow through an array of microchannels capped by a porous membrane is
   studied. The membrane allows the vapor to exit the flow and retains the
   liquid. Effects of different parameters such as wall temperature,
   solution and vapor pressures, and solution mass flux on the desorption
   rate were studied. Two different mechanisms of desorption are analyzed.
   These mechanisms consisted of: (1) direct diffusion of water molecules
   out of the solution and their subsequent flow through the membrane and
   (2) formation of water vapor bubbles within the solution and their
   venting through the membrane. Direct diffusion was the dominant
   desorption mode at low surface temperatures and its magnitude was
   directly related to the vapor pressure, the solution concentration, and
   the heated wall temperature. Desorption at the boiling regime was
   predominantly controlled by the solution flow pressure and mass flux.
   Microscale visualization studies suggested that at a critical mass flux,
   some bubbles are carried out of the desorber through the solution
   microchannels rather than being vented through the membrane. Overall, an
   order of magnitude higher desorption rate compare to a previous study on
   a membrane-based desorber was achieved. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE}},

Pages = {{145-153}},
Abstract = {{The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BZ) has shown promising results in
   some types of cancer, but in others it has had minimal activity. Recent
   studies have reported enhanced efficacy of BZ when combined with
   hyperthermia. However, the use of magnetic nanoparticles to induce
   hyperthermia in combination with BZ has not been reported. This novel
   hyperthermia modality has shown better potentiation of chemotherapeutics
   over other types of hyperthermia. We hypothesized that inducing
   hyperthermia via magnetic nanoparticles (MFH) would enhance the
   cytotoxicity of BZ in BZ-sensitive and BZ-resistant cancer cells more
   effectively than hyperthermia using a hot water bath (HWH). Studies were
   conducted using BZ in combination with MFH in two BZ-sensitive cell
   lines (MDA-MB-468, Caco-2), and one BZ-resistant cell line (A2780) at
   two different conditions, ie, 43 degrees C for 30 minutes and 45 degrees
   C for 30 minutes. These experiments were compared with combined
   application of HWH and BZ. The results indicate enhanced potentiation
   between hyperthermic treatment and BZ. MFH combined with BZ induced
   cytotoxicity in sensitive and resistant cell lines to a greater extent
   than HWH under the same treatment conditions. The observation that MFH
   sensitizes BZ-resistant cell lines makes this approach a potentially
   effective anticancer therapy platform.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents several new observations from the study of a
   numerically simulated warm-core ring (WCR) in the Gulf of Mexico based
   on the ECCO2 global ocean simulation. Using Lagrangian coherent
   structures (LCS) techniques to investigate this flow reveals a pattern
   of transversely intersecting LCS in the mixed layer of the WCR which
   experiences consistent stretching behavior over a large region of space
   and time. A detailed analysis of this flow region leads to an analytical
   model of the velocity field which captures the essential elements that
   generate the transversely intersecting LCS. The model parameters are
   determined from the simulated WCR and the resulting LCS show excellent
   agreement with those observed in the WCR. The three-dimensional
   transport behavior that creates these structures relies on the small
   radial outflow that is present in the mixed layer and is not seen below
   the pycnocline, leading to a sharp change in the character of the LCS at
   the bottom of the mixed layer. The flow behavior revealed by the LCS
   limits fluid exchange between the WCR and the surrounding ocean,
   contributing to the long life of WCRs. Further study of these structures
   and their associated transport behavior may lead to further insights
   into the development and persistence of such geophysical vortices as
   well as their transport behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is widely regarded as an excellent
   candidate for solid lubrication in vacuum. However, it is often
   precluded from many practical applications due to its intrinsically high
   wear rate. Over the past decade, it has been discovered that small
   loading fractions of alumina nanofillers can increase the wear
   resistance of PTFE by three to four orders of magnitude. This dramatic
   increase in wear resistance has in turn prompted numerous tribological
   studies to examine the robustness of this performance. In this study,
   the wear and friction behavior of unfilled PTFE and PTFE and alumina
   nanocomposites were evaluated under a broad range of vacuum environments
   from 760 to 4 x 10(-6) Torr. The nanocomposites of PTFE/alumina showed a
   dramatic increase in wear of over two orders of magnitude at the highest
   vacuum conditions. There appears to be an optimal vacuum environment
   around 1-10 Torr, in which these samples achieved the lowest wear rates
   of approximately 2.5 x 10(-7) mm(3)/(Nm).}},

Title = {{A comparative study of carbon-platinum hybrid nanostructure architecture
   for amperometric biosensing}},
Journal = {{ANALYST}},

Volume = {{139}},

Pages = {{660-667}},
Abstract = {{Carbon and noble metal nanomaterials exhibit unique properties that have
   been explored over the last few decades for developing electrochemical
   sensors and biosensors. Hybridization of nanometals to carbon
   nanomaterials such as graphene or carbon nanotubes produces a
   synergistic effect on the electrocatalytic activity when compared to
   either material alone. However, to date there are no comparative studies
   that directly investigate the effects of nanocarbon concentration and
   nanocomposite arrangement on electron transport. This comparative study
   investigated the efficacy of various platinum-carbon hybrid
   nanostructures for amperometric biosensing. Electroactive surface area,
   sensitivity towards hydrogen peroxide, response time, limit of
   detection, and surface roughness were measured for various hybrid
   nanomaterial arrangements. Both design factors (nanocarbon concentration
   and network arrangement) influenced the performance of the reduced
   graphene oxide-based platforms; whereas only nanomaterial arrangement
   affected the performance of the carbon nanotube-composites. The highest
   sensitivity towards hydrogen peroxide for reduced graphene oxide
   nanocomposites (45 +/- 3.2 mu A mM(-1)) was measured for a graphene
   concentration of 2 mg mL(-1) in a ``sandwich{''} structure; nanoplatinum
   layers enveloping the reduced graphene oxide. Likewise, the best carbon
   nanotube performance toward H2O2 (49 +/- 1.4 mu A mM(-1)) was measured
   for a sandwich-type structure with nanoplatinum. The enhanced
   electrocatalytic activity of this ``sandwich{''} structure was due to a
   combined effect of electrical junctions formed amongst nanocarbon, and
   nanocomposite soldering to the electrode surface. The top-down
   carbon-platinum hybrid nanocomposites in this paper represent a simple,
   low-cost, approach for formation of high fidelity amperometric sensors
   with remarkable performance characteristics that are similar to
   bottom-up fabrication approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile video traffic, owing to the rapid adoption of smartphones and
   tablets, has been growing exponentially in recent years and started to
   dominate the mobile Internet. In reality, mobile video applications
   commonly adopt buffering techniques to handle bandwidth fluctuation and
   minimize the impact of stochastic wireless channels on user experiences.
   However, recent measurement work reveals that mobile users tend to abort
   more frequently than PC users during viewing videos. Such a high
   abortion rate results in a significant wastage of buffered video data,
   which is directly translated into monetary and energy cost for mobile
   users. In this paper, we propose an intelligent buffer management
   strategy called CBM (Cost-aware Buffer Management), for mobile video
   streaming applications. Our purpose is to minimize cost induced by
   un-consumed video data while respecting certain user experience
   requirements. To this objective, we formulate the problem into a
   constrained stochastic optimization problem, and apply the Lyapunov
   optimization theory to derive the corresponding online strategy for cost
   minimization. Different from conventional heuristic-based strategies,
   our proposed CBM strategy can provide provably performance guarantee
   with explicit bounds. We also conduct extensive simulations to validate
   the effectiveness of our proposed strategy and our experimental results
   show that CBM achieves significant gains over existing schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Reported is a systematic molecular structure-property relationship study
   to evaluate the consequences of dedicated H-bonding interactions between
   molecular electron donors on molecular assembly, absorption, charge
   collection, and performance in small-molecule bulk heterojunction
   organic photovoltaic devices. Three families of branched quaterthiophene
   donor chromophores have been synthesized with members that share nearly
   identical electronic and optical properties in the molecularly dispersed
   state but are either capable or incapable of self-association by
   hydrogen bonding (H-bonding). Phthalhydrazide-functionalized
   quaterthiophenes are H-bond ``active{''} and show signatures of H-bond
   promoted assembly in solution (by H-1 NMR) and in both neat and blended
   (with C-60) films (by IR). Compared to control compounds with H-bonding
   ``turned off{''}, the H-bonded derivatives show red-shifted thin film
   absorption (neat and as blends with C-60), different colors as bulk
   solids, and increased decomposition and melt temperatures. Photovoltaic
   devices made from blends of H-bonded donor molecules with C-60 as the
   electron acceptor show improved charge collection length and external
   quantum efficiency resulting in a more than two-fold enhancement in
   power conversion efficiency relative to non-H-bonding controls, from
   0.49\% to 1.04\%. We anticipate this approach could be generalized to
   include other donor chromophores with lower optical gap to harvest more
   longer-wavelength photons and achieve higher power conversion
   efficiencies.}},

Abstract = {{With Moore's law supplying billions of transistors on-chip, embedded
   systems are undergoing a transition from single-core to multi-core to
   exploit this high transistor density for high performance. However, the
   optimal layout of these multiple cores along with the memory subsystem
   (caches and main memory) to satisfy power, area, and stringent real-time
   constraints is a challenging design endeavor. The short time-to-market
   constraint of embedded systems exacerbates this design challenge and
   necessitates the architectural modeling of embedded systems to reduce
   the time-to-market by expediting target applications to
   device/architecture mapping. In this paper, we present a queueing
   theoretic approach for modeling multi-core embedded systems that
   provides a quick and inexpensive performance evaluation both in terms of
   time and resources as compared to the development of multi-core
   simulators and running benchmarks on these simulators. We verify our
   queueing theoretic modeling approach by running SPLASH-2 benchmarks on
   the SuperESCalar simulator (SESC). Results reveal that our queueing
   theoretic model qualitatively evaluates multi-core architectures
   accurately with an average difference of 5.6\% as compared to the
   architectures' evaluations from the SESC simulator. Our modeling
   approach can be used for performance per watt and performance per unit
   area characterizations of multi-core embedded architectures, with
   varying number of processor cores and cache configurations, to provide a
   comparative analysis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Physical cues have the potential to guide stem cell fate by coupling a
   mechanical stimulus to biochemical signaling. We have postulated that
   mechanical stimulation could provide a control method for cell therapy
   applications. This study investigates the use of functionalized magnetic
   nanoparticles to promote hBMSC differentiation towards a smooth muscle
   cell lineage by direct mechanical stimulation of platelet-derived growth
   factor receptor a and beta ( PDGFR alpha and beta) via exposure to
   time-varying magnetic fields. Cyclical magneto-mechanical stimulation of
   PDGFR alpha over a 3 h period results in up-regulation of smooth muscle
   alpha-actin expression in both protein and mRNA level. PDGFR alpha
   phosphorylation is detected in response to stimulation and the mRNA
   up-regulation is abrogated by pretreatment of cells with a receptor
   inhibitor, AG1296 or the neutralization antibody. Our results
   demonstrate proof of concept for remote controlled, locally-delivered
   mechanically induced differentiation of hBMSCs which could have
   applications in regenerative medicine. From the Clinical Editor: Using a
   cyclical magneto-mechanical stimulator, this team of investigators
   demonstrated successful differentiation induction of human bone
   marrow-derived stem cells toward smooth muscle protein expression, with
   potential future applications in regenerative medicine. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Extracellular matrix-based biomaterials are currently pursued as an
   alternative to autologous transplants for the treatment of gingival
   recession and periodontal disease. These grafts offer improved tissue
   regeneration without the need for a second operative procedure used in
   current treatments to remove nonresorbable synthetic biomaterials.
   However, while decellularization is necessary to minimize the potential
   immunological impact, it can significantly modify the materials
   architectural and biochemical properties. By understanding cellular
   responses, it is possible to more specifically target varying clinical
   situations. These investigations assess a novel allogenic scaffold
   derived from the human umbilical vein and determine the effects of two
   decellularization approaches (osmotic lysis and the surfactant Triton
   X-100) on the biological and mechanical properties during early
   remodeling events. Results show Triton X-100 to be significantly more
   effective at extracting lipids, while the extraction of the scaffolds
   bulk protein, GAG and DNA similar between the two treatments. Once
   seeded, scaffolds prepared with osmotic lysis displayed increased
   cellular proliferation and reduced metabolic activity compared to
   scaffolds treated with surfactant. Biomechanical properties were largely
   preserved and similar between the two treatments. These results suggest
   that by optimizing scaffold processing conditions, biological events
   associated with remodeling can be modulated to tailor scaffold function
   for specific clinical applications. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the magnetic properties of 10 mu m thick Co-rich Co-Pt
   films (similar to 80:20 atomic ratio) hard magnetic films electroplated
   on silicon substrates are characterized at temperatures from 300 to 1000
   K. With an increase in temperature up to 500 K, the coercivity and
   remanence of the films both decrease rapidly, dropping to only 10\% of
   their respective as-deposited values. Above 500 K, the coercivity and
   remanence continue declining but at a slower rate, reaching nearly zero
   at 1000 K. Conversely, the saturation magnetization reduces by only 15\%
   at 800 K and 40\% at 1000 K from the as-deposited value. In addition to
   these measurements at elevated temperature measurements, thermal cycling
   tests are performed to examine the influence of various thermal
   exposures. Cycles up to 500 K are shown to have little impact on the
   film morphology but notably reduce the layer adhesion. Most importantly,
   a thermal cycle to just 400 K is shown to essentially destroy the hard
   magnetic properties. Because of these temperature sensitivities, Co-rich
   Co-Pt films may be significantly limited for end applications.}},

Title = {{An evolutionary spectrum approach to modeling non-stationary fading
   channels}},
Journal = {{WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING}},

Volume = {{14}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{To evaluate mobile communication systems, it is important to develop
   accurate and concise fading channel models. However, fading encountered
   in mobile communication is usually non-stationary, and the existing
   methods can only model quasi-stationary or piecewise-stationary fading
   instead of general non-stationary fading. To address this, this paper
   proposes an evolutionary spectrum (ES)-based approach to modeling
   non-stationary fading channels. Our ES approach is more general than the
   existing piecewise-stationary models and is capable of characterizing a
   general non-stationary fading channel that has an arbitrary ES (or
   time-varying power spectral density); our ES approach is parsimonious
   and is also able to generate stationary fading processes. As an example,
   we show how to apply our ES approach to generating stationary and
   non-stationary correlated Nakagami-m fading channel processes.
   Simulation results show that the ES of the channel gain process produced
   by our ES-based channel model agrees well with the user-specified ES,
   indicating the accuracy of our ES-based channel model. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{According to the Taylor tool life equation, tool life reduces with
   increasing cutting speed following a power law. Additional factors can
   also be added, such as the feed rate, in Taylor-type models. Although

   uncertainty in the empirical constants and tool life is generally
   considered a stochastic process. In this work, Bayesian inference is
   applied to estimate model constants for both milling and turning
   operations while considering uncertainty.
   In Part 1 of the paper, a Taylor tool life model for milling that uses
   an exponent, n, and a constant, C, is developed. Bayesian inference is
   applied to estimate the two model constants using a discrete grid
   method. Tool wear tests are performed using an uncoated carbide tool and
   1018 steel work material. Test results are used to update initial
   beliefs about the constants and the updated beliefs are then used to
   predict tool life using a probability density function. In Part 2, an
   extended form of the Taylor tool life equation is implemented that
   includes the dependence on both cutting speed and feed for a turning
   operation. The dependence on cutting speed is quantified by an exponent,
   p, and the dependence on feed by an exponent, q; the model also includes
   a constant, C. Bayesian inference is applied to estimate these constants
   using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo
   (MCMC) approach. Turning tests are performed using a carbide tool and
   MS309 steel work material. The test results are again used to update
   initial beliefs about the Taylor tool life constants and the updated

Abstract = {{It is difficult to get satisfactory churn prediction results by
   traditional models, because the available customer samples in target
   domain are usually few and the class distribution of customer data is
   imbalanced. This study proposes a group method of data handling (GMDH)
   based dynamic transfer ensemble (GDTE) model for churn prediction. It
   first transfers the data in related source domains to the target domain
   by transfer learning technique, and then adopts resampling technique to
   balance the class distribution of the training data. Finally, it trains
   a series of base classifiers and dynamically selects a proper classifier
   ensemble for each test sample by GMDH. The experimental results in two
   datasets show that the performance of GDTE is better than that of one
   traditional churn prediction strategy, as well as three transfer
   learning strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Device-to-device (D2D) communications has recently emerged as a
   promising technology for boosting the capacity of cellular systems. D2D
   enables direct communication between mobile devices over the cellular
   band without utilizing infrastructure nodes such as base stations,
   thereby reducing the load on cellular base stations and increasing
   network throughput through spatial reuse of radio resources. Hence it is
   important to optimally allocate these radio resources. Furthermore,
   since the composition of a cellular macrocell is highly dynamic, it is
   critical to adaptively update the resource allocation for D2D
   communications rather than recomputing it from scratch. In this work, we
   develop the first online algorithm, namely ODSRA, for dynamic resource
   allocation while maximizing spatial reuse. At the core of the resource
   allocation problem is the online set multicover problem, for which we
   present the first deterministic O (log n log m)-competitive online
   algorithm, where n is the number of elements, and m the number of sets.
   By simulation, we show the efficacy of ODSRA by analyzing network
   throughput and other metrics, obtaining a large improvement in running
   time over offline methods.}},

   This leads to, in the various cases, nonparametric models for an
   infinite mixture of Inverse Gaussian, Multinomial Probit and Exponential
   Regression. Estimates of the localized mean function which maps the
   covariates to the response are presented. We prove the weak consistency
   for the posterior distribution of the Exponential model (SB-EX) and then
   propose mean field variational inference algorithms for the Inverse
   Gaussian, Multinomial Probit and Exponential Regression. Finally, we
   demonstrate their superior accuracy in comparison to several other

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the detection of wheel faults in autonomous
   vehicles. Instead of the typically broad range of sensors involved,
   localization data is used to detect and classify three major faults in
   torque-controlled DC motors. A four wheeled vehicle is implemented in
   simulation with independent steering and in-hub motors to generate
   localization data. The vehicle model is based on extensive vehicle
   dynamics modeling to accurately predict a small passenger vehicle. These
   three faults are induced on the vehicle to determine the effectiveness
   of the localization method and test its ability to detect the faults and
   delineate between the different fault types. Lastly, an extension is
   outlined for detection and classification for broader error types beyond
   those represented by the three errors examined.}},

Abstract = {{As the Internet moves into the era of big network data, it presents both
   opportunities and technical challenges for traffic measurement
   functions, such as flow cardinality estimation, which is to estimate the
   number of distinct elements in each flow. Cardinality estimation has
   important applications in intrusion detection, resource management,
   billing and capacity planning, as well as big data analytics. Due to the
   practical need of processing network data in high volume and high speed,
   past research has strived to reduce the memory overhead for cardinality
   estimation on a large number of flows. One important thread of research
   in this area is based on sketches. The representative work includes the
   FM sketches {[}1], the LogLog sketches {[}2], and the HyperLogLog
   sketches {[}3]. Each sketch requires multiple bits and many sketches are
   needed for each flow, which results in significant memory overhead. This
   paper proposes a new method of virtual maximum likelihood sketches to
   reduce memory consumption. First, we design virtual sketches that use no
   more than two bits per sketch on average. Second, we design virtual
   sketch vectors that consider all flows together. Based on these new
   constructs, we design a flow cardinality solution with an online
   operation module and an offline estimation module. We also consider the
   problem of differentiated estimation that gives flows of high priorities
   better precision in their cardinality estimations. We implement the new
   solution and perform experiments to evaluate its performance based on
   real traffic traces.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we investigate how to achieve information integrity in two
   common models of source coding with side information. We first look at
   the classical Wyner-Ziv problem, where the side information is available
   only to the decoder, with an adversary whom may arbitrarily change the
   ``bin{''} index sent to the decoder. Interestingly, it is easy to show
   that standard Wyner-Ziv coding suffices to guarantee no adversary attack
   strategy may achieve arbitrarily small probability of fooling the
   decoder if the side information is correlated with the source.
   Subsequently, we consider the case where the side information is
   available also at the encoder, and hence joint source encoding can be
   performed. Here we show the result of Wyner-Ziv problem also extends to
   joint encoding without needing the side information to be correlated
   with the source. Moreover, no loss in the optimal compression rate is
   incurred in order to guarantee information integrity in either case.}},

Abstract = {{This qualitative research paper examines the meaning and enactment of
   critical thinking for engineering undergraduate students. Though
   critical thinking is considered an important topic in the engineering
   community, research on the topic is limited to mostly measuring critical
   thinking in the classroom and definitions used are not empirically
   based. Thus, in this paper we seek to provide an initial exploration of
   what critical thinking is in engineering. We address the following
   research question: How do undergraduate engineering students perceive
   and enact critical thinking? Semi-structured interviews were conducted
   on the enactment of critical thinking and analyzed using a thematic
   analysis. Main themes that arose from the interviews included:
   difficulty articulating critical thinking ideas, relating critical
   thinking to engineering course concepts (especially problem solving),
   communicating with others, disposition to think critically,
   metacognition, challenges of critical thinking in the classroom, and
   critical thinking varying in other disciplines and majors. Problem
   solving concepts prevailed in the many of the themes. Although themes
   connected with many of the ideas present in current definitions of
   critical thinking, most students did not mention concepts of
   clarification, credibility, generalization, or recognizing assumptions.
   Participants also emphasized a broader idea of communication and
   stronger reliance on real world context in critical thinking than
   previously established by critical thinking definitions.}},

Abstract = {{This synthesis paper examines the concepts of critical thinking,
   reflective practice, and adaptive expertise as represented throughout
   academic literature. The academic community generally considers each of
   these skillsets to be desirable attributes of engineering graduates and
   practitioners. Despite the trend of engineering programs across the
   country to embrace critical thinking, reflective practices, and adaptive
   expertise through mission and vision statements, the development of
   these qualities through education may be falling short. Lack of explicit
   exposure to and discussion of each concept may be contributing to the
   common inability of engineering students and educators to effectively
   communicate their understanding of each. In an attempt to contribute to
   the improvement of the situation, this paper aims to provide an
   individual evaluation of each topic as represented in the literature, a
   review of current operationalization techniques, and the current state
   of each topic within the field of engineering. Additional discussion
   builds connections by exploring relationships among the three topics,
   considers issues related to the topics within engineering, and offers
   possible areas of future exploration.}},

   Students to Function Effectively on Industry-sponsored Project Teams}},

Abstract = {{Completion of a capstone design project typically occurs in the final
   year of study in U.S. engineering schools. Capstone design projects are
   often completed by teams of students charged with designing and
   implementing solutions to real-world problems. Many programs feature
   projects that are sought from industrial sponsors. These
   industry-supported projects require that the student teams interact
   regularly with their off-campus clients. While lectures focus heavily on
   teaching technical skills, professional skills are often overlooked due
   to limited classroom time. Providing professional training to senior
   engineering students will help them work more effectively with their
   industry sponsors and project team, as well as make them competitive
   candidates for positions upon graduation.
   This paper describes a training and reference guide developed for
   capstone design students at University of Florida (UF) enrolled in the
   Integrated Product and Process Design (IPPD) Program. The Professional
   Guide communicates key project research and legal elements, establishes
   expectations for professional conduct, and defines business procedures
   that must be followed. Rather than devote classroom time to these
   topics, the guide and associated training elements essentially
   constitute a self-paced new-hire professional orientation program for
   capstone design students. Experience at UF suggests that the
   Professional Guide provides an efficient vehicle for delivering
   important training that might otherwise be neglected.
   The Professional Guide's project research and legal elements cover
   essential intellectual property, non-disclosure, and export controls
   aspects. The expectations for professional conduct areas covered include
   sexual harassment prevention, identification of at-risk students, basic
   laboratory safety, and over two dozen ethics mini-case studies developed
   from real IPPD experiences. Items lumped into the business procedures
   include training for the IPPD collaboration and project management
   tools, lab and classroom rules, effective meeting strategies, and
   procedures for purchasing and travel. Many of the training elements
   require creation of web-based elements for students to prove they have
   mastered the materials. Students also receive certificates for the
   Preventing Sexual Harassment and At-Risk Student training courses. As an
   incentive to complete the required training, each team's laboratory
   access is withheld until all team members complete the assignments.}},

   proposed the use of FPGAs to accelerate SMVM implementations. However,
   most prior approaches focus on parallelizing multiply-accumulate
   operations within a single row of the matrix (which limits parallelism
   if rows are small) and/or make inefficient uses of the memory system
   when fetching matrix and vector elements. In this paper, we introduce an
   FPGA-optimized SMVM architecture and a novel sparse matrix encoding that
   explicitly exposes parallelism across rows, while keeping the hardware
   complexity and on-chip memory usage low. This system compares favorably
   with prior FPGA SMVM implementations. For the over 700 University of
   Florida sparse matrices we evaluated, it also performs within about two
   thirds of CPU SMVM performance on average, even though it has 2.4x lower
   DRAM memory bandwidth, and within almost one third of GPU SVMV
   performance on average, even at 9x lower memory bandwidth. Additionally,
   it consumes only 25W, for power efficiencies 2.6x and 2.3x higher than
   CPU and GPU, respectively, based on maximum device power.}},

Abstract = {{The persistent spread of a destination host is the number of distinct
   sources that have contacted it persistently in predefined t measurement
   periods. A persistent spread estimator is a software/hardware component
   on a router that inspects the arrival packets and estimates the
   persistent spread of each destination. This is a new primitive for
   network measurement that can be used to detect long-term stealthy
   malicious activities, which cannot be recognized by the traditional
   superspreader detectors that are designed only for ``elephant{''}
   activities. However, the challenge is to function such an estimator in
   fast but small memory space ( such as on-chip SRAM of line cards), in
   order to keep up with the high speed of switching fabric for packet
   forwarding. This paper presents an implementation that can use very
   tight memory space to deliver high estimation accuracy: Its memory
   expense is less than one bit per flow element in each time period; Its
   estimation accuracy is over 90\% better than a continuous variant of
   Flajolet-Martin sketches; Its operating range to produce effective
   measurements is hundreds of times broader than the traditional bitmap.
   These advantages originate from a new data structure called
   multi-virtual bitmap, which is designed to estimate the cardinality of
   the intersection of an arbitrary number of sets. We have verified the
   effectiveness of our new estimator using the real network traffic traces
   from CAIDA.}},

Abstract = {{A summary of preparation methods of various substrates suitable for the
   epitaxial growth of copper zinc tin sulfide (CZTS) via molecular beam
   epitaxy (MBE) is presented. Substrates evaluated include silicon
   (various orientations), ZnS(110), Al2O3(0001), and gallium phosphide
   (GaP) (100). An overview of the techniques used to prepare a
   high-quality, epiready surface for each substrate is covered, with
   special attention given to the limitations presented by CZTS MBE, namely
   the stability of surfaces with respect to sulfur vapor. The quality of
   the substrates prior to growth has been assessed by in-situ reflection
   high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) and photoemission techniques.
   ZnS epitaxial growth was attempted on all substrates because ZnS is
   viewed as a simplified model system for CZTS. ZnS epitaxial quality was
   assessed using RHEED during growth and via electron backscatter
   diffraction (EBSD) post-growth.}},

Abstract = {{A decentralized event-triggered control scheme for leader-follower
   consensus is developed. The approach aims to reduce inter-agent
   communication while ensuring asymptotic leader-follower consensus. The
   objective is achieved by designing a control algorithm that uses the
   estimates of neighbors' states for feedback and only updates the
   estimates through communication when events are triggered. The update
   events are determined by a decentralized trigger condition, designed
   from the stability analysis, such that the control ensures asymptotic
   leader-follower consensus with only intermittent communication. The
   effectiveness of reducing inter-agent communication is shown by
   developing a positive constant lower bound of the minimum inter-event
   interval. Since switched dynamics are considered, Zeno execution is
   proven to be avoided, and Lyapunov-based convergence analysis is
   provided to ensure the asymptotic leader-follower consensus. Simulation
   results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed
   control strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Mean-field models are a popular tool in a variety of fields. They
   provide an understanding of the impact of interactions among a large
   number of particles or people or other ``self-interested agents{''}, and
   are an increasingly popular tool in distributed control.
   This paper considers a particular randomized distributed control
   architecture introduced in our own recent work. In numerical results it
   was found that the associated meanfield model had attractive properties
   for purposes of control. In particular, when viewed as an input-output
   system, its linearization was found to be minimum phase.
   In this paper we take a closer look at the control model. The results
   are summarized as follows:
   (i) The Markov Decision Process framework of Todorov is extended to
   continuous time models, in which the `` control cost{''} is based on
   relative entropy. This is the basis of the construction of a family of
   Markovian generators, parameterized by a scalar zeta is an element of R.
   (ii) A decentralized control architecture is proposed in which each
   agent evolves as a controlled Markov process. A central authority
   broadcasts a common control signal \{zeta(t)\} to each agent. The
   central authority chooses \{zeta(t)\} based on an aggregate scalar
   output of the Markovian agents.
   This is the basis of the mean field model.
   (iii) Provided the control-free system (with zeta = 0) is a reversible
   Markov process, the following identity holds for the transfer function G
   obtained from the linearization,
   Re (G(j omega)) = PSDY(omega) >= 0 omega is an element of R,
   where the right hand side denotes the power spectral density for the
   output of any one of the individual Markov processes (with zeta  0).}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this paper is to gain insight into the equations arising in
   nonlinear filtering, as well as into the feedback particle filter
   introduced in recent research. The analysis is inspired by the optimal
   transportation literature and by prior work on variational formulation
   of nonlinear filtering. The construction involves a discrete-time
   recursion based on the successive solution of minimization problems
   involving the so-called forward variational representation of the
   elementary Bayes' formula. The construction shows that the dynamics of
   the nonlinear filter may be regarded as a gradient flow, or a steepest
   descent, for a certain energy functional with respect to the
   Kullback-Leibler divergence pseudo-metric. The feedback particle filter
   algorithm is obtained using similar analysis. This filter is a
   controlled system, where the control is obtained via consideration of
   the first order optimality conditions for the variational problem. The
   filter is shown to be exact, i. e., the posterior distribution of the
   particle matches exactly the true posterior, provided the filter is
   initialized with the true prior.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is motivated by the desire to develop optimal defensive
   strategies that discourage an attacker from engaging a high-value
   target. We analyze an Engage or Retreat Differential Game in which one
   player represents an attacker and the other player represents a
   defender. The attacker is capable of terminating the game in engagement
   or retreat. The defender attempts to manipulate the attacker's choice
   through the strategic maximization or minimization of the attacker's
   cost function. Both players are free to switch strategies at any point
   during the game. We show that for certain conditions, the defender
   should cooperate with the attacker so that retreat becomes the most
   attractive option. A value function constraint prevents the attacker's
   retreat trajectory from passing into a region in which engagement would
   become optimal. This leads to certain regions of constrained retreat
   which may be thought of as escort regions. In these escort regions, the
   defender cooperates with the attacker so long as the attacker maintains
   appropriate separation from the regions of engagement. The theory is
   illustrated with a numerical example.}},

Abstract = {{This paper revisits the problem of particle uncertainty characterization
   and propagation for deterministic nonlinear continuous time dynamical
   systems. A revealing comparison is made between the traditional Monte
   Carlo method and a recently developed particle framework based on Markov
   chain Monte Carlo and the method of characteristics (MCMC-MOC). The
   focus is on dynamical systems that do not admit stationary solutions
   that often pose bigger problems for the Liouville equation than systems
   with fixed points. We demonstrate through dispersion analysis that while
   traditional Monte Carlo is unable to propagate the state density
   function in a statistically consistent manner and suffers from
   degeneracy, the MCMC-MOC approach performs very well. The new approach
   automatically extracts the domain of significance (support) of the state
   density function by constructing a Markov Chain guided by the solution
   of the stochastic Liouville equation. Being equivalent in measure to the
   true state probability density, the particles in the Markov chain can be
   used directly to compute desired expectations. Simple examples are used
   to illustrate the potential pitfalls of using traditional Monte Carlo
   and the corresponding advantages of the MCMC-MOC technique.}},

Abstract = {{A variable-order adaptive mesh refinement method for solving optimal
   control problems is described. The method employs orthogonal collocation
   at Legendre-Gauss-Radau points. The mesh refinement method uses a
   previously derived convergence rate in order to modify the mesh. First,
   in regions where the solution is not sufficiently smooth, the method
   employs mesh interval refinement to place mesh points near
   discontinuities in the solution. Next, in regions where the solution is
   smooth the method increases the degree of the approximating polynomial.
   Furthermore, the method can decrease the size of the mesh in one of two
   ways. First, by representing the state using a power series
   approximation it is possible to decrease the required polynomial degree
   when it is determined that the coefficients of the highest powers of the
   power series are insignificant in comparison to the mesh refinement
   accuracy tolerance. Second, mesh intervals can be combined if it is
   determined that the power series representations are the same in two or
   more adjacent mesh intervals. Finally, the method is described in detail
   and is applied successfully to an example from the open literature.}},

Abstract = {{Cycling induced by functional electrical stimulation (FES) is an
   effective means for exercise and rehabilitation of individuals suffering
   from neurological disorders such as stroke, spinal cord injury, and
   cerebral palsy. To achieve FES-cycling, potential fields are alternately
   applied across muscle groups in the lower extremities. Alternating
   stimulation of various muscle groups according to the crank position
   makes the FES-cycling system a switched system with autonomous
   state-dependent switching. This paper examines FES-cycling from a
   switched systems analysis perspective. Specifically, a switched sliding
   mode controller is developed to yield approximate tracking of a desired
   cadence despite an uncertain, nonlinear cycle-rider model. Cadence
   tracking is proven via a common Lyapunov-like function and experimental
   results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the switched

Abstract = {{Flexibility of energy consumption can be harnessed for the purposes of
   ancillary services in a large power grid.
   In prior work by the authors a randomized control architecture is
   introduced for individual loads for this purpose. In examples it is
   shown that the control architecture can be designed so that control of
   the loads is easy at the grid level: Tracking of a balancing authority
   reference signal is possible, while ensuring that the quality of service
   (QoS) for each load is acceptable on average. The analysis was based on
   a mean field limit (as the number of loads approaches infinity),
   combined with an LTI-system approximation of the aggregate nonlinear
   model.
   This paper examines in depth the issue of individual risk in these
   systems. The main contributions of the paper are of two kinds:
   Risk is modeled and quantified
   (i) The average performance is not an adequate measure of success. It is
   found empirically that a histogram of QoS is approximately Gaussian, and
   consequently each load will eventually receive poor service.
   (ii) The variance can be estimated from a refinement of the LTI model
   that includes a white-noise disturbance; variance is a function of the
   randomized policy, as well as the power spectral density of the
   reference signal. Additional local control can eliminate risk
   (iii) The histogram of QoS is truncated through this local control, so
   that strict bounds on service quality are guaranteed.
   (iv) This has insignificant impact on the grid-level performance, beyond
   a modest reduction in capacity of ancillary service.}},

Abstract = {{Underwater localization faces many constrains and long-term persistent
   global localization for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is very
   difficult. In this paper, we propose a novel AUV localization method
   taking advantage of the recent progress in ocean general circulation
   models (OGCMs). During navigation, the AUV performs intermittent local
   background flow velocity measurements or estimates using on-board
   sensors. A series of preloaded flow velocity forecast maps generated by
   OGCMs are referred by a particle filter in updating particle weights
   based on resemblance between forecasts and local estimation. A rigorous
   derivation of the problem in probability theory is presented to reveal
   the recursive structure of the target distribution function. Simulations
   in a simple double-gyre velocity field exhibit satisfactory converging
   localization error. Further simulations in a flow field with local flow
   fluctuations that are not resolved by OGCMs show similar convergent
   localization error with a slower converging rate. As a first step
   towards a new set of underwater localization methods, this work presents
   promising results and reveals the possibility of realizing converging
   global underwater localization through partial utilization of the
   background flow information that is easily accessible.}},

   (CEB) architecture which addresses scalability and performance through a
   built-in distributed optimization framework. In this paper, we focus on
   CEB's optimization framework which follows a bi-directional waterfall
   model in which not only sensor data can move upward to applications, but
   applications (fragments) can move downward to lower layers of CEB closer
   to data sources. The framework enables many optimization ideas and
   opportunities, including our own. We present the bi-directional
   waterfall framework along with a sketch of several of our optimization
   algorithms enabled by the framework. We also present an example of an
   experimental study to determine dominant resources in the cloud a
   variable which as will be seen greatly affects the logic of some of the

Abstract = {{After clients outsource their data to the cloud, they will lose physical
   control of their data. Many schemes are proposed for clients to verify
   the integrity of their data. This paper considers a complementary
   problem: When a client claims that the server has lost their data, how
   can we be sure that the client is correct and honest about the loss? It
   is possible that the client's meta data is corrupted or the client is
   lying in order to blackmail the server. In addition, most previous work
   relies on sequential indices. However, the indices bring significant
   overhead to bind an index to each block. We propose to replace
   sequential indices with much flexible non-sequential coordinates. The
   binding of coordinates to data blocks is performed through a Coordinate
   Merkle Hash Tree (CMHT). Based on CMHT, we can improve both the average

Abstract = {{Data security is a major concern in cloud computing. After clients
   outsource their data to the cloud, will they lose control of the data?
   Prior research has proposed various schemes for clients to confirm the
   existence of their data on the cloud servers, and the goal is to ensure
   data integrity. This paper investigates a complementary problem: When
   clients delete data, how can they be sure that the deleted data will
   never resurface in the future if the clients do not perform the actual
   data removal themselves? How to confirm the non-existence of their data
   when the data is not in their possession? One obvious solution is to
   encrypt the outsourced data, but this solution has a significant
   technical challenge because a huge amount of key materials may have to
   be maintained if we allow fine-grained deletion. In this paper, we
   explore the feasibility of relieving clients from such a burden by
   outsourcing keys (after encryption) to the cloud. We propose a novel
   multi-layered key structure, called Recursively Encrypted Red-black Key
   tree (RERK), that ensures no key materials will be leaked, yet the
   client is able to manipulate keys by performing tree operations in
   collaboration with the servers. We implement our solution on the Amazon
   EC2. The experimental results show that our solution can efficiently
   support the deletion of outsourced data in cloud computing.}},

Abstract = {{Parallel/Distributed computing frameworks, such as MapReduce and Dryad,
   have been widely adopted to analyze massive data. Traditionally, these
   frameworks depend on manual configuration to acquire network proximity
   information to optimize the data placement and task scheduling. However,
   this approach is cumbersome, inflexible or even infeasible in
   large-scale deployments, for example, across multiple datacenters.
   In this paper, we address this problem by utilizing the Software-Defined
   Networking (SDN) capability. We build Palantir, an SDN service specific
   for parallel/distributed computing frameworks to abstract the proximity
   information out of the network. Palantir frees the framework
   developers/administrators from having to manually configure the network.
   In addition, Palantir is flexible because it allows different frameworks
   to define the proximity according to the framework-specific metrics. We
   design and implement a datacenter-aware MapReduce to demonstrate
   Palantir's usefullness. Our evaluation shows that, based on Palantir,
   datacenter-aware MapReduce achieves siginficant performance improvement.}},

Abstract = {{As cloud computing thrives, many small organizations are joining a
   public cloud to take advantage of its multiple benefits. Cloud computing
   is cost efficient, i.e., cloud user can reduce spending on technology
   infrastructure and have easy access to their information without
   up-front or long-term commitment of resources. Moreover, a cloud user
   can dynamically grow and shrink the resources provisioned to an
   application on demand. Despite those benefits, cyber security concern is
   the main reason many large organizations with sensitive information such
   as the Department of Defense have been reluctant to join a public cloud.
   This is because different public cloud users share a common platform
   such as the hypervisor. A common platform intensifies the well-known
   problem of cyber security interdependency. In fact, an attacker can
   compromise a virtual machine (VM) to launch an attack on the hypervisor
   which if compromised can instantly yield the compromising of all the VMs
   running on top of that hypervisor. Therefore, a user that does not
   invest in cyber security imposes a negative externality on others. This
   research uses the mathematical framework of game theory to analyze the
   cause and effect of interdependency in a public cloud platform. This
   work shows that there are multiple possible Nash equilibria of the
   public cloud security game. However, the players use a specific Nash
   equilibrium profile depending on the probability that the hypervisor is
   compromised given a successful attack on a user and the total expense
   required to invest in security. Finally, there is no Nash equilibrium in
   which all the users in a public cloud will fully invest in security.}},

Abstract = {{Wide-area Virtual-Machine (VM) live migration can serve as a
   disaster-recovery solution for IT services by moving virtualized servers
   to safe locations upon a critical disaster. In this scenario, it is
   desirable to evacuate as many VMs as possible under limited and changing
   electrical power and network conditions. The challenges are 1) when
   migrating many VMs simultaneously, the migration time of each individual
   VM increases, resulting in high probability of migration failures due to
   power or network failures; 2) the sequential migration of VMs may not
   efficiently use the network; and 3) network conditions, such as
   available bandwidth and congestion, fluctuate over time. There is a need
   to solve a multi-objective problem that aims at reducing simultaneously
   the total migration time and individual migration times. In this paper,
   we focus on precopy migration and present 1) the design and
   implementation of a feedback-based control system that manages VM
   migrations of multiple servers and tackles the aforementioned
   challenges, 2) valuable findings from extensive experiments and 3) a
   metric to evaluate the migration performance that takes into account
   both the total and individual migration times. The proposed system
   monitors the network usage of hosts, adjusts migration parameters, and
   coordinates the migration scheduling of VMs. It is a promising approach
   to efficiently transfer IT services from a damaged datacenter to a fully
   functional one by automatically managing migrations across datacenters.
   Experiments are conducted with several combinations of parameters
   including network conditions, migration strategies, controller type,
   memory distribution, and live/offline VM migrations. The results show 1)
   the usefulness of a feedback-based controller with a global view that
   can coordinate multiple physical machines to efficiently use network
   resources and reduce migration times, 2) the factors that affect the
   migration performance of multiple hosts, 3) the potential of improving
   sequential VM migration by integrating support for parallel TCP
   connections, and 4) near-optimal operating point is found while
   balancing both the total migration time and individual migration times
   by using the proposed control system.}},

Abstract = {{Photo sharing is an attractive feature which popularizes Online Social
   Networks (OSNs). Unfortunately, it may leak users' privacy if they are
   allowed to post, comment, and tag a photo freely. In this paper, we
   attempt to address this issue and study the scenario when a user shares
   a photo containing individuals other than himself/herself (termed
   co-photo for short). To prevent possible leakage of a photo privacy, we
   design a mechanism to enable each individual in a photo be aware of the
   posting activity and participate in the decision making on the photo
   posting. For this purpose, we need an efficient facial recognition (FR)
   system that can recognize everyone in the photo. However, more demanding
   privacy setting may limit the number of the photos publicly available to
   train the FR system. To deal with this dilemma, our mechanism attempts
   to utilize users' private photos to design a personalized FR system
   specifically trained to differentiate possible photo co-owners without
   leaking his/her privacy. We have also developed a distributed
   consensus-based method to not only reduce the computational complexity,
   but also preserve the privacy during the training. We show that our
   system is superior to other possible approaches in terms of recognition
   ratio and efficiency. Our mechanism is implemented as an Android
   application on Facebook's platform.}},

Abstract = {{In full-duplex Gaussian relay channels, neither Decode-and-Forward (DF)
   nor Compress-and-Forward (CF) can achieve a larger rate than the other
   for all the channel gain combinations. Combining DF and CF strategies,
   we show that a new achievable rate, which is the concave envelop of the
   maximal rate achieved by DF and CF with respect to the source power, is
   achievable. To this end, we actively adjust the transmission power of
   the source for different time and switch the transmission strategy
   between DF and CF according to the source power. It is proved that when
   the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the source-destination link falls
   into a certain range, the new achievable rate is strictly larger than
   that achieved by pure DF and pure CF. The optimal power allocation and
   corresponding time proportions are also obtained. Numerical results show
   that the new achievable rate is also competitive with the rate achieved
   by superposing CF on DF. As strategy switching avoids complex codeword
   constructions, it is more practical than superposition structures to be
   implemented in relay systems.}},

Abstract = {{Modern computing nodes often contain more than just a CPU. With the
   advent of GPU accelerators and Xeon Phi co-processors, there are many
   architectures available for data processing. However, it is difficult to
   understand which device is best for a given application. The issue of
   real-world performance originates in the lack of quantifiable data and
   method for analysis. This paper presents a novel, multi-tiered framework
   that leverages Pareto optimization to objectively construct the best
   processing node for a set of computational kernels. By deconstructing
   the optimization process into three distinct framework tiers (kernel,
   device, and system), the system designer is able to understand how the
   various computational variables impact device choices. We show how we
   leverage a combination of metrics and benchmarking to form various
   Pareto sets. Moving through the tiers, these Pareto sets are combined to
   identify the various combinations that enable maximum performance.}},

Abstract = {{Power efficiency is an important aspect in today's high-performance
   embedded computing (HPEC) systems. Digital signal processors (DSPs) are
   well known for their power efficiency and are commonly employed in
   embedded systems. Increasing computational demands in image-and
   signal-processing applications in embedded systems has led to the
   development of multicore DSPs with floating-point capabilities. The
   TMS320C6678 is an eight-core, high-performance DSP from Texas
   Instruments that provides 128 GFLOPS of single-precision and 32 GFLOPS
   of double-precision performance under 10W of power. In this paper, we
   optimize and evaluate the performance of the TMS320C6678 DSP using two
   image-processing kernels, 2D convolution and bilinear interpolation with
   image rotation, and two signal-processing kernels, frequency-domain
   finite impulse response (FDFIR) and corner turn. Our 2D convolution
   results show that the performance of the TMS320C6678 is comparable to a
   Nvidia GeForce 295 GTX GPU and 5 times better than a quad-core Intel
   Xeon W3520 CPU. We achieve real-time performance for bilinear
   interpolation with image rotation on the TMS320C6678 for high-definition
   (HD) image resolution. Our performance per Watt results for FDFIR shows
   that the TMS320C6678 is 8.2 times better than the Nvidia Tesla C2050
   GPU. For corner turn, although the raw performance of the Tesla C2050 is
   better than the TMS320C6678, the performance per Watt of TMS320C6678 is
   1.8 times better than the Tesla C2050.}},

Abstract = {{In cooperative cognitive radio networks (CCRNs), through cooperating
   with primary transmissions, secondary users (SUs) could access the
   spectrum resource when primary users (PUs) are transmitting. The
   existing schemes in CCRNs allocate the spectrum resource only to the
   cooperative relay SU. However, this may lead to the waste of spectrum
   resource, especially when the relay SU has light traffic load or poor
   channel condition. To better utilize the spectrum among all SUs in a
   secondary network, we design a spectrum resource utilization
   maximization scheme with joint consideration of relay selection and
   spectrum scheduling problems. With the goal to maximize the throughput
   of the secondary network, our scheme allocates spectrum among all SUs
   according to the diversity of secondary traffic load and the channel
   conditions. Besides, considering that the SUs are always energy limited,
   we also formulate the energy constraint for each SU to avoid the energy
   consumption exceeding the total available energy. Moreover, we study the
   resource allocation problem from long-term view under dynamic network
   setting, and design an online algorithm to solve it. Through extensive
   simulations, we show that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing
   schemes in terms of secondary network throughput.}},

   a novel delay-rate-distortion optimization (dRDO) based rate control

   coding delay versus buffering delay and available source coding rate
   versus redundant rate incurred by channel coding, are coupled in the

   constraints, by joint selection of search range and quantization step
   size in source coding and channel code rate in channel coding.

Abstract = {{Most wheelchairs have low directional stability due to their wheel-drive
   system configurations. Hence, when a wheelchair experiences excessive
   slip, it will create an uncontrollable moment that changes its heading
   direction, endangering the safety of the wheelchair user. This paper
   presents an approach to longitudinal slip reduction (or traction
   control) for an Electric Powered Wheelchair that uses a variable
   reference model, which is a mass-damper system. The position of a
   joystick is mapped to force and torque values, which are the input to
   this model. The output is the desired trajectory, which is fed to a
   trajectory tracking controller. The key idea is that if slip occurs, the
   applied torque to the wheels is reduced by decreasing the desired
   acceleration, which is achieved by changing the parameters of the
   reference model. In this study, the mass of the reference model is
   changed. The proposed slip reduction approach is validated via
   experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Increased variability in power generation due to large scale integration
   of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power is a
   significant technical challenge in power systems operations and control.
   In addition, there is a compelling value in reducing the peak demand
   since it occurs only for a small fraction of time, while the power
   system is designed to reliably satisfy the peak demand. One promising
   approach to reduce variability of renewable generation and peak demand
   is to harness the inherent flexibility of electric power loads of
   consumers. Efficient control techniques are required to manage
   flexibility in consumer demands. Advancements in sensing, communications
   and computational technologies infused into the power system resulting
   in the cyber-physical-social electric grid, are creating opportunities
   for novel control solutions. In this paper, we first formulate a
   centralized demand side management approach. Next, we consider a
   decentralized approach for controlling the loads where the flexible load
   consumers play a non-cooperative game among each other. We show that
   Nash equilibria exist for this game. Our main technical result is that
   the demand response game in decentralized approach has the property of
   being a valid monotone utility game. This in turn leads to robust lower
   bounds on the price of anarchy ( POA) for our game.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an algorithm for hard and soft data fusion is developed
   for tracking moving objects using hard data from sensors on autonomous
   agents and soft data from human observations. Two main challenges are
   identified and addressed in this paper: 1. how to model the human
   observation, 2. how to estimate state using soft data and fuse it with
   the state estimates from the sensors on autonomous agents (e.g., a
   camera sensor). A novel approach is developed to model perceived human
   observations to the real physical states using artificial neural
   networks (ANN). A particle filter (PF) is used to estimate a moving
   target's state based on range and bearing observation data from a human
   observer and an EKF is used to estimate the target state using on-board
   camera sensor. The range measurement is represented using Kumaraswamy's
   double bounded distribution. The state estimates computed based on a
   model of human observation learned by an ANN are fused with the state
   estimates from the on-board sensors using a fast covariance intersection
   (CI) algorithm. The CI algorithm yields consistent fused estimates in
   the absence of unknown correlations between state estimates obtained
   using human measurements and robot sensor measurements. The performance
   of the developed algorithms is validated on a target tracking simulation
   platform.}},

Abstract = {{In real world motion planning tasks, autonomous vehicles can easily
   deviate away from their planned trajectories due to external
   disturbances, uncertain wheel/leg-terrain interaction, and other errors
   in the model used for planning. A possible solution to this problem
   consists in the continuous usage of replanning strategies. However,
   replanning is in general computationally intensive and its use should be
   minimized when possible. In this paper, a new methodology for robust
   trajectory tracking is proposed. The method generates, via sampling,
   correcting control inputs to drive the vehicle back to the desired
   trajectory. Due to the use of sampling, the methodology easily
   incorporates nonlinear planning models and integrates seamlessly with
   sampling-based motion planners. The paper presents simulation and
   preliminary experimental results showing the efficacy of the proposed
   approach and thus its potential application to motion planning tasks
   with real-time constraints.}},

   respect to human variability in terms of psycho-physiological and

Abstract = {{The integrate-and-fire model of a biological neuron is an amplitude to
   time encoding in the spacing between action potentials (spikes). In
   principle, this encoding can be used to modulate signals in an Impulse
   Radio Ultra Wide-Band (IRUWB) transmitter suitable for Wireless Sensor
   Networks (WSN). This paper presents a system level study on power
   efficiency using MATLAB/ Simulink to evaluate the required energy for an
   IR-UWB Transmitter using integrate-and-fire encoding technique. Also, a
   simple but clear comparison with common systems utilizing Nyquist rate
   Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADC) is presented. This study has been
   carried out on a band-limited random Gaussian signal and the results
   show that IR-IF transmitter consumes roughly seven times less energy
   than a digital UWB transmitter; moreover, in the proposed architecture
   the need for power hungry ADC is relaxed.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the memory hierarchy's large contribution to a microprocessor's
   total power, cache tuning is an ideal method for optimizing overall
   power consumption in embedded systems. Since most embedded systems are
   power and area constrained, the hardware and/or software that
   orchestrate cache tuning-the cache tuner-must not impose significant
   power and area overhead. Furthermore, as embedded systems increasingly
   trend towards multicore, inter-core data sharing, communication, and
   synchronization impose additional cache tuner design complexity,
   necessitating cross-core cache tuning coordination. In order to minimize
   cache tuner overhead, cache tuner design must consider these overheads
   and scalability. Whereas prior work proposes low-overhead cache tuners,
   scalability to multicore systems requires additional considerations. In
   this work, we present a low-overhead, scalable cache tuner and
   extensively evaluate various cache tuner design tradeoffs with respect
   to power and area for constrained multicore embedded systems. Based on
   our analysis, we formulate valuable insights and designer-assisted
   guidelines for modeling scalable and efficient cache tuners that best
   achieve optimization goals while maintaining power and area constraints.}},

Abstract = {{Digitized Heat Transfer (DHT) is a relatively new and promising form of
   thermal management that uses discrete droplets to remove excess heat. In
   this investigation, DHT is studied using infrared thermography to
   measure the heat transfer to a digitized flow in a microchannel that is
   subject to a constant heat flux. Results show that heat transfer,
   characterized by Nusselt number (Nu), exhibits an initial power law
   decay followed by periodic oscillations whose period is dependent on
   droplet aspect ratio. The overall magnitude of Nu is found to have a
   positive correlation with Reynolds number (Re). Using two scaling
   constants given by f(1) = root Pe/AR and f(2) = 5.14/AR + 3.27, the
   experimental Nu curves for various flows are scaled and approximately
   collapsed to a single curve. In the future, these simplified Nu curves
   will be helpful in analyzing and designing potential DHT thermal
   solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Fluid flow in a microchannel is primarily laminar due to viscous forces
   dominating over body or inertia forces. Hence fluid circulation in a
   droplet greatly enhances heat transfer. As a result, slip at a
   wall-fluid interface could have a two fold affect on heat transfer in
   droplet based thermal systems; the first is a direct result of thermal
   slip at the fluid-wall interface, the second is due to hydrodynamic slip
   at the interface which leads to reduction of internal circulation and in
   turn reduction in heat transfer. In this paper molecular dynamic
   simulations are used to look at the effects of thermal and hydrodynamic
   slip separately and then to investigate the cumulative effect of them on
   heat transfer in moving droplets in a microchannel. The affect of
   hydrodynamic slip in an isothermal channel is studied and it is observed
   that circulation is inversely dependent on slip length. A simple model
   is established that captures this effect and it also shows that the
   effect of slip on circulation only becomes important when the length
   scale of the problem is comparable to the order of slip length.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we report a new experimental method to independently and
   simultaneously measure the capillary pressure and permeability of wick
   structures and a simulation framework to establish their theoretical
   limits. The maximum liquid transport rates through different micropillar
   wick geometries operating against gravity are determined at various
   wicking lengths by measuring the dryout threshold. The capillary
   pressure and the permeability of these wicks are obtained by fitting the
   mass flow rate vs. wicking length data to Darcy's law. The permeability
   and capillary pressure values of these geometries are subsequently used
   to validate literature models of these two parameters. A permeability
   model, based on Stokes flow past infinitely long cylinders and corrected
   to account for the effect of meniscus curvature and finite pillar
   height, closely predicts the experimental data. A capillary model
   relating the pressure to the wick geometry using a thermodynamic
   approach better predicts the experimental results. An overall model
   consisting of Darcy's law and the selected capillary and permeability
   models, and capable of predicting mass flow rates through these arrays
   is proposed. Genetic algorithms together with the overall mass flow rate
   model are used to design optimized micropillar wicks. It is shown that
   the dimensions of the optimum geometry vary with the wicking length for
   devices operating against gravity. Experimental data from a
   representative optimal wick are used to verify the theoretical
   optimization results. This overall model is then employed to ascertain
   the theoretical mass transport limits of micropillar wick structures.}},

Abstract = {{We consider ad hoc wireless networks that use frequency hopping to
   provide multiple access capability among radios. In such systems, the
   multiple-access control (MAC) protocol must be designed to provide an
   appropriate level of simultaneous transmissions to efficiently utilize
   the channel, while not causing so much multiple-access interference that
   data transmissions cannot be decoded correctly. The transmission rates
   of the radios should be adapted based on the number of radios that
   simultaneously have data to transmit in the network. However, for most
   networks employing spread spectrum, it is difficult to determine the
   number of radios contending in the network at any particular time. In
   this paper, we present a method of estimating the number of radios in a
   system employing frequency-hopping spread spectrum by observing the
   interference activity at the physical layer of each radio. Each radio
   uses its locally generated interference estimate to adapt its
   transmission probability to maximize the sum throughput of the overall
   network. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate that this
   approach offers performance close to the maximum possible sum
   throughput.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of assigning a group of users with different
   rate requirements to a set of frequency bands, which may have different
   bandwidths, when the users access the channel via carrier-sense multiple
   access (CSMA). For example, in systems that employ dynamic spectrum
   access (DSA), secondary users may interleave their transmissions into
   space-time-frequency slots left open by primary users. The set of
   primary users that are active at a given time may leave a set. of
   available channels that have unequal bandwidths. The use of CSMA by the
   secondary users reduces the need to coordinate transmissions among the
   users allocated to a particular frequency band, but it also results in
   potential collisions, which reduce the overall data rate that can be
   accommodated in the band. This is especially true when the presence of a
   finite sensing delay is considered. In this paper, we consider the layer
   problem of allocating users to the available frequency bands to minimize
   the bandwidth used (to accommodate other groups of secondary users),
   while taking into account the CSMA interactions of assigning multiple
   users to a band. We formulate this as a new form of bin packing problem,
   in which the size of the bin depends on the number of users that are
   assigned to the bin. A near optimal solution to this problem is found
   numerically using the Gurobi solver, and the performance is compared
   with the suboptimal first-fit algorithm, which has complexity that is
   appropriate for online implementation. Simulation results are provided
   to compare the optimal and online algorithms in terms of efficiency in
   allocating the bandwidth to the users and their complexity.}},

Abstract = {{A new generation of social discovery and crowd sourced location-based
   services promise to integrate mobile computing into our lives more than
   ever. An essential component in these services is the neighbor or peer
   selection, that is also needed for peer-to-peer (P2P) mobile
   applications and multiplayer mobile gaming. One major challenge is posed
   by the interpretation of the information collected by the smartphones
   (about nearby devices, locations) to bring the user closer to
   context-awareness and informed peer selection. We introduce a framework
   and a corresponding application (ConnectEnc) for mobile peer rating
   using a multi-dimensional metric scheme based on encounter and location
   sensing.
   ConnectEnc maintains a history of discovered nearby devices and
   locations, and rates them using an array of metrics ranging in
   complexity from simple (encounter frequency) to complex and novel
   (location vector and matrix similarity). We have developed and deployed
   ConnectEnc application on Android and Nokia N810 platform to measure the
   link between the scores of proposed filters and device selection by the
   user. Results from the deployment shows that statistically high
   correlation exists between ConnectEnc recommendations and user
   selections.
   Our framework is distributed, modular and can serve as a peer selection
   platform for other mobile protocols based on specific requirements. It
   runs on individual devices and does not require data sharing or
   interaction; and hence can bootstrap other recommendation, cooperation
   or reputation systems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel FPGA-based architecture for the Speeded-Up
   Robust Feature (SURF) extractor. By leveraging the inherent parallelism
   of the SURF algorithm, we designed a fully pipelined architecture
   implemented on the FPGA fabric of a Xilinx Zynq-7020 device
   (XC7Z020CLG484-1). Compared with other high-performing SURF designs in
   the literature, our implementation achieved the highest frame rate
   (131.36 fps) while compactly fitting on a single device and consuming
   only 0.608 Watts of average power. An experimental platform featuring a
   640x480 resolution camera was used to compare the proposed design with
   OpenSURF, a widely used open-source C++ library, running on a high-end
   Intel i7 processor. Our system achieved real-time performance
   independent of the number of interest points extracted from the targeted
   image, and consistently outperformed the SURF software baseline,
   reaching a maximum speedup of 15. An extensive analysis was conducted to
   prove that the performance of our proposed architecture was as robust as
   the SURF algorithm to image transformations (rotation and scaling) and
   image distortions (blurring and pixelation), demonstrating that
   interest-point repeatability was maintained under varying viewing
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{As the essential infrastructures for cloud computing, data centers are
   facing increasing pressure of capping tremendous power consumption and
   carbon emission. Currently, many proposals have leveraged energy storage
   devices (in the form of UPS batteries) to provide buffered energy during
   peak power demands for reducing data center power cost. In addition,
   energy storage devices are also used to smooth out power supply
   variation in renewable energy powered data centers for effectively
   cutting down carbon emissions. However, a joint management of peak power
   shaving and renewable energy harvesting in data centers is still
   lacking. Existing schemes either incur green energy efficiency
   degradation or sacrifice data center availability and workload
   performance.
   In this paper, we propose a novel power delivery scheme Re-UPS, which is
   based on existing UPS infrastructures and employs renewable energy to
   cap peak power consumption and carbon emission in data centers. Re-UPS
   leverages distributed energy storage architecture and dynamic online
   heuristic energy management strategy to enable data centers to achieve
   the best optimization among maximizing renewable energy harvest, shaving
   peak power demands and improving UPS system availability. We evaluate
   Re-UPS under different environmental conditions and workload. Our
   results show that Re-UPS can increase green energy utilization by
   74.1\%, improve backup energy capacity by 16.5\%, and extend the battery
   life by 10.6\%.}},

Abstract = {{As the Tanzania population grows, scarcity of resources like water and
   electricity will pose a great risk to horticultural crop production and
   society activities. Precision irrigation poses a great opportunity to
   save water and energy in agriculture. The current off-the-shelf machines
   used to control water are incompatible to Tanzanian conditions, very
   expensive, delicate, or don't have enough features. This study proposed
   a reprogram mabie control system prototype design and implementation
   that can be used for African countries, particularly in Tanzania. The
   proposed integrated controller is a solar-powered system that uses low
   cost electronic devices to automate drip irrigation and to determine
   when to irrigate and how much to irrigate. The controller has been
   tested under African farms and achieved a high level of reliability and
   maintainability. The controller is a high tech tool that can be
   reprogrammed or updated wirelessly using a laptop and the data can be
   downloaded using any android based smartphone. The wireless technology
   incorporated can be used to transfer instant data of rainfall and soil
   moisture content. The system automates data cleaning while collecting
   instant information of the soil moisture, temperature, humidity and
   rainfall. It can store data at least for seven days.}},

Abstract = {{Many complex systems, from World Wide Web and online social networks to
   mobile networks, exhibit community structure in which nodes can be
   grouped into densely interconnected communities. This special structure
   has been exploited extensively to design better solutions for many
   operations and applications such as routing in wireless networks, worm
   containment and interest prediction in social networks. The outcome of
   these solutions are sensitive to the network structures, which raises an
   important question: can communities be broken easily in a network? To
   answer this question, we introduce a density-based problem formulation
   for analyzing the vulnerability of communities. Our approach includes
   the NP-completeness and a O(log k) approximation algorithm for solving
   the problem where k is the number of communities to be broken.
   Additionally, we analyze the vulnerability of communities in the context
   of arbitrary community detection algorithms. The empirical results show
   that communities are vulnerable to edge removal and in some cases the
   removal of a small fraction of edges can break the community structure.}},

   influence of fluid viscosity and magnet geometry on the velocity

   highly viscous fluids, such as bovine synovial fluid (eta similar to 1
   Pa.s). A first-order theoretical model has been developed to predict the
   particle motion, as well as a numerical multiphysics model. Both models
   exhibit good agreement with in vitro experimental magnetic collection
   results. The velocity of the magnetic particles is shown to be inversely
   proportional to fluid viscosity, and two magnetic structures are
   compared in term of collection efficiency: a cylindrical Nd-Fe-B
   permanent magnet and a laser-machined conical Nd-Fe-B permanent magnet.}},

Abstract = {{Azimuthal magnetic fields at a relatively far distance (50 km),
   generated by a lightning strike to the top of mountain and to the top of
   an 80-m-high grounded object located on the top of mountain, have been
   analyzed using the 2D finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method in the
   cylindrical coordinate system. Also, the influence of the presence of a
   mountain range located between the lightning strike point and field
   observation point on the azimuthal magnetic field has been studied.
   Azimuthal magnetic fields associated with lightning strike to the top of
   mountain are higher than those associated with the corresponding strike
   to a flat ground for both fast-and slow-front lightning currents. The
   presence of an 80-m-high strike object further increases magnetic field
   peaks for higher ground conductivity (>= 1000 mS/m) and shorter current
   risetime (<= 1 mu s). The field enhancement for the case of lightning
   strike to a mountain decreases with decreasing the ground conductivity.
   The shielding effect due to a 1-km-high mountain range located between
   the lightning strike and observation points is insignificant for
   relatively-slow-front currents.}},

   tests for a small residential structure with the connected home
   appliances and electronics conducted in 2013 at the new test site in

   was the same as in the previous studies, that is, to examine the current
   waveshapes in different parts of the circuit and the division of the
   injected surge current between the grounding system of the LPS and
   remote ground. The current waveshapes in the vertical ground electrodes
   differed from the injected current waveshapes and from the current
   waveshapes in other parts of the test system. Computer simulation using
   ATP-EMTP carried out in order to verify the measurements. Vertical and
   horizontal ground electrodes are modeled for specified parameter
   resulting from the geometrical configuration of the system and the
   measured soil conductivity. Computed results show a good agreement with
   the experimental data. A significant influence of frequency dependent
   components of the system impedances on current waveshapes has been

Abstract = {{This paper reconsiders Gurson (1975, 1977)'s famous limit-analysis of a
   hollow sphere made of some ideal-plastic von Mises material and
   subjected to conditions of homogeneous boundary strain rate (Mandel,
   1964; Hill, 1967). The emphasis is put on successive approximations of
   the overall plastic dissipation, based on Taylor expansions of one term
   appearing in the integral defining it. Gurson (1975, 1977) considered
   only the approximation based on the first-order expansion, which led to
   his famous homogenized criterion. The approximations based on the
   second- and third-order expansions are considered here. For each of
   these approximations, the explicit analytic expression of the overall
   plastic dissipation is derived and used to study the corresponding
   porosity rate. The most important result is that the correction of the
   predicted porosity rate brought by the second-order approximation to the
   first-order one is quite significant. This bears notable consequences
   upon the prediction of ductile damage under certain conditions. (C) 2014

   predictions of the new model. The new and intriguing features predicted

   calculations. Irrespective of the loading history, it was found that

Abstract = {{At present, modeling of the plastic response of porous solids is done
   using stress-based plastic potentials. To gain understanding of the
   combined effects of all invariants for general three-dimensional
   loadings, a strain-rate based approach appears more appropriate. In this
   paper, for the first time strain rate-based potentials for porous solids
   with Tresca and von Mises matrices are obtained. The dilatational
   response is investigated for general 3-D conditions for both compressive
   and tensile states using rigorous upscaling methods. It is demonstrated
   that the presence of voids induces dependence on all invariants, the
   noteworthy result being the key role played by the plastic flow of the
   matrix on the dilatational response. If the matrix obeys the von Mises
   criterion, the shape of the cross-sections of the porous solid with the
   octahedral plane deviates slightly from a circle, and changes very
   little as the absolute value of the mean strain rate increases. However,
   if the matrix behavior is described by Tresca's criterion, the shape of
   the cross-sections evolves from a regular hexagon to a smooth triangle
   with rounded corners. Furthermore, it is revealed that the couplings
   between invariants are very specific and depend strongly on the
   particularities of the plastic flow of the matrix. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We describe techniques and results for computing optimal (minimum
   Initial Mass in Low Earth Orbit (IMLEO)) round-trip trajectories to Mars
   with total mission duration no greater than one year. The trajectory
   options surveyed include direct trajectories between Earth and Mars, as
   well as trajectories that include a Venus gravity assist flyby on the
   way to Mars, on the way back to Earth, or both. The method of embedded
   trajectory grids is used to identify the optimal round-trip trajectory
   solutions without Venus flybys, while a genetic algorithm is employed to
   identify the optimal solutions that include Venus. The IMLEO required
   for the mission is further reduced by modeling a pre-positioning of
   Earth return propellant at Mars via lower energy trajectories in advance
   of the human portion of the mission, as well as assuming the use of
   On-Orbit Staging (OOS) in the propulsion system design. Optimal
   trajectory design results are presented for an array of cases that span
   ranges of values for various key design parameters including thruster
   specific impulses, human spacecraft dry mass, and maximum permissible
   Earth atmospheric entry speed.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of many revolution low-thrust Earth-orbit trajectory
   optimization is considered. The objective is to transfer a spacecraft
   from a parking orbit to a desired terminal orbit in minimum time. The
   minimum-time orbital transfer problem is posed as a nonlinear optimal
   control problem, and the optimal control problem is solved using a
   direct transcription variable-order Gaussian quadrature collocation
   method. It is found that the thrust-to-mass ratio holds a power
   relationship to the transfer time, final mass, and final true longitude.
   Using these power relationships obtained through regression on the
   collected results, it is possible to estimate the performance of a given
   thrust-to-mass ratio without solving for the optimal trajectory. In
   addition, the key structure of the optimal orbital transfers are
   identified. The results presented provide insight into the structure of
   the optimal performance for a range of small thrust-to-mass ratios and
   highlight the interesting features of the optimal solutions. Finally, a
   discussion of the performance of the variable order Gaussian quadrature
   collocation method is provided.}},

Abstract = {{The field of orthopedic tissue engineering is quickly expanding with the
   development of novel materials and strategies designed for rapid bone
   regeneration. While autologous bone grafts continue to be the standard
   of care, drawbacks include donor-site morbidity and short tissue
   supplies. Herein we report a novel nanocomposite sponge composed of
   poly(1,8-octanediol-co-citrate) (POC) and the bioactive ceramic
   beta-tricalcium phosphate (TCP). We show that these nanocomposite
   sponges can be used as a depot for bone-producing (a.k.a. osteogenic)
   growth factors. In vitro bioactivity is demonstrated by significant
   upregulation of osteogenic genes, osteopontin (similar to 3 fold
   increase), osteocalcin (similar to 22 fold increase), alkaline
   phosphatase (similar to 10 fold increase), and transcription factor,
   RUNX2 (similar to 5 fold increase) over basal expression levels in
   mesenchymal stem cells. In vivo osteogenicity and biocompatibility is
   demonstrated in a standard subcutaneous implant model in rat. Results
   show that the nanocomposite sponge supports complete cell infiltration,
   minimal adverse foreign body response, positive cellular proliferation,
   and cellular expression of osteogenic markers in subcutaneous tissue.
   The results shown herein are encouraging and support the use of this
   sponge for future bone tissue engineering efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Neuromotor prostheses have the potential of restoring movement ability
   in patients with severe motor dysfuncion. In cortically-controlled
   neuromotor prostheses, the design of neural decoders for motor impaired
   patients requires initialization using a concurrently measured set of
   neural and motor imagery or observation data. In addition, the decoder
   implementation poses a scalability challenge with an increasing number
   of decoded neurons. Consequently, most neural decoder implementations
   resort to sub-sampling the neural firing rates, which results in noisy
   decoded outputs. In this work, we propose a new decoder design and
   implementation framework in which (i) the decoder initialization is
   unsupervised, (ii) the decoder is implemented using
   computationally-inexpensive recursive filters that can operate at
   high-resolution sampling of the neural data thereby minimizing the delay
   introduced in the system, and (iii) the decoder gives a smooth real-time
   control signal expressed by the span of neural data projections onto a
   low-dimensional latent space that possesses desirable features for the
   control task.}},

Abstract = {{A technique to obtain high resolution atmospheric data using small
   mobile sensors is presented. A fluid based control scheme using smoothed
   particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is implemented to perform field
   measurements in a leader-follower arrangement for a team of unmanned
   aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with environmental sensors. A virtual
   leader is created by using a reduced density SPH particle to guide the
   unmanned aerial vehicles along a desired path. Simulations using the
   control scheme demonstrate excellent measurement ability, swarm
   coherence, and leader following capability for large swarms. A K-means
   algorithmis used to reduce the measurement error and provide accurate
   interpolation of the field measurement data. Experimental results are
   presented which demonstrate the guidance and collision avoidance
   properties of the control scheme using real UAVs. Readings from the
   UAV's temperature and humidity sensor suite are used with the K-means
   algorithm to produce a smooth estimation of the respective distribution
   fields.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to evaluate side-to-side differences in
   three-dimensional clavicle kinematics in normal shoulders during dynamic
   scapular plane elevation using model-image registration techniques.
   Twelve healthy males with a mean age of 32 years (range, 27-36 years
   old) were enrolled in this study. Clavicle rotations were computed with
   bilateral fluoroscopic images and CT-derived bone models using
   model-image registration techniques and compared between dominant and
   nondominant shoulders. There was no difference in retraction between
   both shoulders. The clavicle in dominant shoulders was less elevated
   during abduction than in nondominant shoulders (P = 0.03). Backward
   rotation angles of dominant shoulders were significantly smaller than
   those of nondominant shoulders throughout the activity (P = 0.03).
   Clavicular kinematics during scapular plane abduction were different
   according to hand-dominance. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights

Abstract = {{Multihop cellular networks (MCNs) have drawn tremendous attention due to
   its high throughput and extensive coverage. However, there are still
   three issues not well addressed. With the existence of relay stations
   (RSs), how to efficiently allocate frequency resource to relay links
   becomes a challenging design issue. For mobile stations (MSs) near the
   cell edge, cochannel interference (CCI) become severe, which
   significantly affects the network performance. Furthermore, the
   unbalanced user distribution will result in traffic congestion and
   inability to guarantee quality of service (QoS). To address these
   problems, we propose a quantitative study on adaptive resource
   allocation schemes by jointly considering interference coordination (IC)
   and load balancing (LB) in MCNs. In this paper, we focus on the downlink
   of OFDMA-based MCNs with time division duplex (TDD) mode, and analyze
   the characteristics of resource allocation according to IEEE 802.16j/m
   specification. We also design a novel frequency reuse scheme to mitigate
   interference and maintain high spectral efficiency, and provide
   practical LB-based handover mechanisms which can evenly distribute the
   traffic and guarantee users' QoS. Our study shows that our scheme not
   only meets the requirement on coverage, but also improves the throughput
   while accommodating more users in MCNs.}},

   law is designed using an image-based visual servo control method in
   conjunction with a sliding-mode control strategy, which is shown to
   achieve asymptotic target interception in the presence of the
   aforementioned uncertainties. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is

Abstract = {{In this paper, a cooperative visual servo controller is presented for
   autonomous citrus harvesting. A fixed camera provides a global view of a
   tree canopy for the camera-in-hand, attached to the end-effector, to
   servo to a target fruit. The paper focuses on the development of a
   robust, image-based, nonlinear visual servo controller to regulate the
   end-effector to the fruit location in the presence of unknown fruit
   motion. A robust feedback term is included in the controller to
   compensate for the bounded fruit motion, for example, due to wind gusts
   and robot-tree contact. Lyapunov-based stability analysis guarantees
   uniformly ultimately bounded regulation of the end-effector. The
   presented work differs from the existing methods in that the fruit
   motion in the form of unknown disturbance dynamics are included in the
   control formulation to actively compensate for the motion without the
   need for high-frequency image feedback.}},

   for multi-label classification based on well established Rank-SVM
   algorithm. Based on the features of the application, we remove the bias
   term b and modify the decision boundary. Due to the absence of term b,
   SCRank-SVM has milder optimization constraints. Therefore, SCRank-SVM
   achieves better solution space compared with Rank-SVM. Experimental
   results on five datasets show that the proposed algorithm is a powerful
   candidate for multi-label classification, compared with four existing
   state of the art multilabel algorithms according to four indicative
   measures.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present an asymmetric stagewise least square (ASLS)
   loss function for imbalanced classification. While keeping all the
   advantages of the stagewise least square (SLS) loss function, such as,
   better robustness, computational efficiency and sparseness, the ASLS
   loss extends the SLS loss by adding another two parameters, namely, ramp
   coefficient and margin coefficient. Therefore, asymmetric ramps and
   margins can be formed which makes the ASLS loss be more flexible and
   appropriate for processing class imbalance problems. A reduced kernel
   classifier of the ASLS loss is also developed which only uses a small
   part of the dataset to generate an efficient nonlinear classifier.
   Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the ASLS loss in
   imbalanced classification.}},

   factorization to fit the data precisely, as well as including a
   dictionary specifically to account for noise. Using non-negative matrix
   factorization also allows an increase in dimensionality, which increases
   the frequency resolution of the algorithm.
   The method is tested on a database of trumpet notes and compared to

Abstract = {{Use of multiple kernels in the conventional kernel algorithms is gaining
   much popularity as it addresses the kernel selection problem as well as
   improves the performance. Kernel least mean square (KLMS) has been
   extended to multiple kernels recently using different approaches, one of
   which is mixture kernel least mean square (MxKLMS). Although this method
   addresses the kernel selection problem, and improves the performance, it
   suffers from a problem of linearly growing dictionary like in KLMS. In
   this paper, we present the quantized MxKLMS (QMxKLMS) algorithm to
   achieve sub-linear growth in dictionary. This method quantizes the input
   space based on the conventional criteria using Euclidean distance in
   input space as well as a new criteria using Euclidean distance in RKHS
   induced by the sum kernel. The empirical results suggest that QMxKLMS
   using the latter metric is suitable in a non-stationary environment with
   abruptly changing modes as they are able to utilize the information
   regarding the relative importance of kernels. Moreover, the QMxKLMS
   using both metrics are compared with the QKLMS and the existing
   multi-kernel methods MKLMS and MKNLMS-CS, showing an improved
   performance over these methods.}},

Abstract = {{Net zero energy is a topic that is trending in the construction

   Elementary School (K-5) is a high performance school which can achieve
   net zero energy status with some proven and effective practices. In this
   paper, we discuss and compare the current baseline energy usage of the
   school since its completion and target opportunities to reduce energy
   usage. Recommendations based on the ASHRAE Advanced Energy Design Guide
   (50\% Energy Savings) with the help of energy modelling and simulation
   would close the gap needed to make Florida schools energy
   self-sufficient. Further renewable energy production will be added by
   taking advantage of the Florida climate zone. The suggestions reviewed

Abstract = {{Modal analysis is widely used for linear dynamic analysis of structures.
   The fmite element method is used to numerically compute stiffness and
   mass matrices and the corresponding eigenvalue problem is solved to
   determine the natural frequencies and mode shapes of vibration. Implicit
   boundary method was developed to use equations of the boundary to apply
   boundary conditions and loads so that a background mesh can be used for
   analysis. A background mesh is easier to generate because the elements
   do not have to conform to the given geometry and therefore uniform
   regular shaped elements can be used. In this paper, we show that this
   approach is suitable for modal analysis and modal superposition
   techniques as well. Furthermore, the implicit boundary method also
   allows higher order elements that use B-spline approximations. Several
   test examples are studied for verification.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of joint angles, angular velocities is essential for control
   of link mechanisms and robots. The estimation of joint angles and
   angular velocity is performed using combination of inertial sensors
   (accelerometers and gyroscopes) which are con tactless and flexible at
   point of application. Different estimation techniques are used to fuse
   data from different inertial sensors. Bio-inspired sensors using
   symmetrically placed multiple inertial sensors are capable of
   instantaneously measuring joint parameters (joint angle, angular
   velocities and angular acceleration) without use of any estimation
   techniques. Calibration of inertial sensors is easier and more reliable
   for accelerometers as compared to gyroscopes.
   The research presents gyroscope-less, multiple accelerometer and
   magnetometer based sensors capable of measuring (not estimating) joint
   parameters. The contribution of the improved sensor are four-fold.
   Firstly, the inertial sensors are devoid of symmetry constraint unlike
   the previously researched bio-inspired sensors. However, the
   accelerometer are non-coplanarly placed. Secondly, the
   accelerometer-magnetometer combination sensor allows for calculation of
   a unique rotation matrix between two link joined by any kind of joint.
   Thirdly, the sensors are easier to calibrate as they consist only of
   accelerometers. Finally, the sensors allow for calculation of angular
   velocity and angular acceleration without use of gyroscopes.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, a family of online kernel-learning algorithms, known as the
   kernel adaptive filtering (KAF) algorithms, has become an emerging area
   of research. The KAF algorithms are developed in reproducing kernel
   Hilbert spaces (RKHS), by using the linear structure of this space to
   implement well-established linear adaptive algorithms and to obtain
   nonlinear filters in the original input space. These algorithms include
   the kernel least mean squares (KLMS), kernel affine projection
   algorithms (KAPA), kernel recursive least squares (KRLS), and extended
   kernel recursive least squares (EX-KRLS), etc. When the kernels are
   radial (such as the Gaussian kernel), they naturally build a growing RBF
   network, where the weights are directly related to the errors in each
   sample. The aim of this chapter is to give a brief introduction to
   kernel adaptive filters. In particular, our focus is on KLMS, the
   simplest KAF algorithm, which is easy to implement, yet efficient.
   Several key aspects of the algorithm are discussed, such as
   self-regularization, sparsification, quantization, and the mean-square
   convergence. Application examples are also presented, including in
   particular the adaptive neural decoder for spike trains.}},

Abstract = {{For a common class of 2D mechanisms called 1-dof tree decomposable
   linkages, the following fundamental problems have remained open: (a) How
   to canonically represent (and visualize) the connected components in the
   Euclidean realization space. (b) How to efficiently find two
   realizations representing the shortest ``distance{''} between two
   connected components. (c) How to classify and efficiently find all the
   connected components, and the path(s) of continuous motion between two
   realizations in the same connected component, with or without
   restricting the realization type (sometimes called orientation type).
   For a subclass of 1-dof tree-decomposable linkages that includes many
   commonly studied 1-dof linkages, we solve these problems by representing
   a connected component of the Euclidean realization space as a curve in a
   carefully chosen Cayley (non-edge distance) parameter space; and proving
   that the representation is bijective. We also show that the above set of
   Cayley parameters is canonical for all generic linkages with the same
   underlying graph, and can be found efficiently. We add an implementation
   of these theoretical and algorithmic results into the new software
   CayMos, and give (to the best of our knowledge) the first complete
   analysis, visualization and new observations about the realization
   spaces of many commonly studied 1-dof linkages such as the amusing and
   well-known Strandbeest, Cardioid, Limacon and other linkages. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Bloom filters have been extensively applied in many network functions.
   Their performance is judged by three criteria: query overhead, space
   requirement, and false positive ratio. Due to wide applicability, any
   improvement to the performance of Bloom filters can potentially have a
   broad impact in many areas of networking research. In this paper, we
   study Bloom-1, a data structure that performs membership check in one
   memory access, which compares favorably with the k memory accesses of a
   standard Bloom filter. We also generalize Bloom-1 to Bloom-g and
   Bloom-alpha, allowing performance tradeoff between membership query
   overhead and false positive ratio. We thoroughly examine the variants in
   this family of filters, and show that they can be configured to
   outperform the Bloom filters with a smaller number of memory accesses, a
   smaller or equal number of hash bits, and a smaller or comparable false
   positive ratio in practical scenarios. We also perform experiments based
   on a real traffic trace to support our filter design.}},

Title = {{Heat Transfer Evaluation on Curved Boundaries in Thermal Lattice
   Boltzmann Equation Method}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEAT TRANSFER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{An efficient and accurate approach for heat transfer evaluation on
   curved boundaries is proposed in the thermal lattice Boltzmann equation
   (TLBE) method. The boundary heat fluxes in the discrete velocity
   directions of the TLBE model are obtained using the given thermal
   boundary condition and the temperature distribution functions at the
   lattice nodes close to the boundary. Integration of the discrete
   boundary heat fluxes with effective surface areas gives the heat flow
   rate across the boundary. For lattice models with square or cubic
   structures and uniform lattice spacing the effective surface area is
   constant for each discrete heat flux, thus the heat flux integration
   becomes a summation of all the discrete heat fluxes with constant
   effective surface area. The proposed heat transfer evaluation scheme
   does not require a determination of the normal heat flux component or a
   surface area approximation on the boundary; thus, it is very efficient
   in curved-boundary simulations. Several numerical tests are conducted to
   validate the applicability and accuracy of the proposed heat transfer
   evaluation scheme, including: (i) two-dimensional (2D) steady-state
   thermal flow in a channel, (ii) one-dimensional (1D) transient heat
   conduction in an inclined semi-infinite solid, (iii) 2D transient heat
   conduction inside a circle, (iv) three-dimensional (3D) steady-state
   thermal flow in a circular pipe, and (v) 2D steady-state natural
   convection in a square enclosure with a circular cylinder at the center.
   Comparison between numerical results and analytical solutions in tests
   (i)-(iv) shows that the heat transfer is second-order accurate for
   straight boundaries perpendicular to one of the discrete lattice
   velocity vectors, and first-order accurate for curved boundaries due to
   the irregularly distributed lattice fractions intersected by the curved
   boundary. For test (v), the computed surface-averaged Nusselt numbers
   agree well with published results.}},

Abstract = {{Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from peripheral blood hold important
   information for cancer diagnosis and disease monitoring. Analysis of
   this ``liquid biopsy{''} holds the promise to usher in a new era of
   personalized therapeutic treatments and real-time monitoring for cancer
   patients. But the extreme rarity of CTCs in blood makes their isolation
   and characterization technologically challenging. This paper reports the
   development of a geometrically enhanced mixing (GEM) chip for
   high-efficiency and high-purity tumor cell capture. We also successfully
   demonstrated the release and culture of the captured tumor cells, as
   well as the isolation of CTCs from cancer patients. The high-performance
   microchip is based on geometrically optimized micromixer structures,
   which enhance the transverse flow and flow folding, maximizing the
   interaction between CTCs and antibody-coated surfaces. With the
   optimized channel geometry and flow rate, the capture efficiency reached
   >90\% with a purity of >84\% when capturing spiked tumor cells in
   buffer. The system was further validated by isolating a wide range of
   spiked tumor cells (50-50 000) in 1 mL of lysed blood and whole blood.
   With the combination of trypsinization and high flow rate washing,
   captured tumor cells were efficiently released. The released cells were
   viable and able to proliferate, and showed no difference compared with
   intact cells that were not subjected to the capture and release process.
   Furthermore, we applied the device for detecting CTCs from metastatic
   pancreatic cancer patients' blood; and CTCs were found from 17 out of 18
   samples (>94\%). We also tested the potential utility of the device in
   monitoring the response to anti-cancer drug treatment in pancreatic
   cancer patients, and the CTC numbers correlated with the clinical
   computed tomograms (CT scans) of tumors. The presented technology shows
   great promise for accurate CTC enumeration, biological studies of CTCs
   and cancer metastasis, as well as for cancer diagnosis and treatment
   monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effect of poly (ethyleneimine) (PEI)-modified silica
   abrasive on the removal rate and the degree of dishing during Cu
   chemical mechanical planarization (CMP). The PEI-modified silica
   abrasive was prepared by mutually attractive electrostatic forces
   between PEI and silica abrasive. The physico-chemical behaviors between
   PEI and the silica abrasive were evaluated by total organic carbon
   (TOC), force-separation measurements using atomic force microscopy (AFM)
   with molecular weight of PEI, which was found to adsorb on silica at pH
   7.0 following a Langmuir isotherm. The maximum adsorbed amounts of low
   and high molecular weight PEI were 0.195 mg/m(2) and 0.228 mg/m(2),
   respectively. AFM results showed the repulsive force of the adsorbed PEI
   layers on the silica surface and the adsorption thickness of PEI on
   silica vary with the molecular weight of PEI. A twofold change was
   observed in the AFM analysis. First, the increased areal density of
   adsorbed PEI caused a higher zeta-potential and longer reaching
   repulsive force. Second, the adsorption thickness was also significantly
   enlarged. High molecular weight showed increased adsorption thickness
   under similar conditions compared to low molecular weight of PEI. These
   changes of silica abrasive such as electrostatic forces and steric
   interaction vary with molecular weight of PEI reduced the dishing of Cu
   pattern film from 50 to 20 nm. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a new loss function for neural network
   classification, inspired by the recently proposed similarity measure
   called Correntropy. We show that this function essentially behaves like
   the conventional square loss for samples that are well within the
   decision boundary and have small errors, and L-o or counting norm for
   samples that are outliers or are difficult to classify. Depending on the
   value of the kernel size parameter, the proposed loss function moves
   smoothly from convex to non-convex and becomes a close approximation to
   the misclassification loss (ideal 0-1 loss). We show that the
   discriminant function obtained by optimizing the proposed loss function
   in the neighborhood of the ideal 0-1 loss function to train a neural
   network is immune to overfitting, more robust to outliers, and has
   consistent and better generalization performance as compared to other
   commonly used loss functions, even after prolonged training. The results
   also show that it is a close competitor to the SVM. Since the proposed
   method is compatible with simple gradient based online learning, it is a
   practical way of improving the performance of neural network
   classifiers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We provide experimental evidence for the existence of ferromagnetism in
   bilayers of Pd/C-60 which is supported by theoretical calculations based
   on density functional theory (DFT). The observed ferromagnetism is
   surprising as C-60 and Pd films are both non-ferromagnetic in the
   non-interacting limit. Magnetization (M) versus applied field (H) data
   acquired at different temperatures (T) show magnetic hysteresis with
   typical coercive fields (H-c) on the order of 50 Oe. From the
   temperature-dependent magnetization M(T) we extract a Curie temperature
   (T-c >= 550 K) using Bloch-like power law extrapolations to high
   temperatures. Using DFT calculations we investigated all plausible
   scenarios for the interaction between the C-60 molecules and the Pd
   slabs, Pd single atoms and Pd clusters. DFT shows that while the C-60
   molecules are nonmagnetic, Pd films have a degenerate ground state that
   subject to a weak perturbation, can become ferromagnetic. Calculations
   also show that the interaction of C-60 molecules with excess Pd atoms
   and with sharp edges of a Pd slab is the most likely configuration that
   render the system ferromagnetic Interestingly, the calculated charge
   transfer (0.016 e per surface Pd atom, 0.064 e per Pd for intimate
   contact region) between C-60 and Pd does not appear to play an important
   role. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Anti-reflection (AR) coatings are widely used in a spectrum of optical
   and optoelectronic devices, such as monitors, car dashboards, optical
   lenses, photodiodes, and solar cells. Narrowband quarter-wavelength
   single-layer and broadband multilayer dielectric AR coatings are
   typically fabricated by expensive and low-throughput vapor deposition
   processes (e.g., sputtering). Inspired by the subwavelength-structured
   cornea of some nocturnal moths, nanostructured broadband moth-eye AR
   coatings that can significantly suppress optical reflection over a wide
   range of wavelengths and light incident angles have been extensively
   exploited by both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Among many
   available bottom-up technologies, colloidal self-assembly is a promising
   approach as it is simple, fast, and inexpensive. In this review article,
   we will discuss two scalable colloidal self-assembly technologies based
   on Langmuir-Blodgett assembly and spin-coating for fabricating
   quarter-wavelength and moth-eye AR coatings with unique self-cleaning
   functionalities on transparent substrates (e.g., glass) and
   semiconductor wafers (such as crystalline silicon and GaAs). (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is applied to investigate
   aggregation behavior of an anionic conjugated polyelectrolyte (CPE)
   featuring branched carboxylate groups (PPE-(CO2)-C-d) upon the addition
   of different metal ions. FCS results reveal that monovalent metal ions
   (Na+, K+) bind to the CPE chain but do not induce aggregation, and
   divalent metal ions (Ca2+, Cu2+) bind and induce the formation of small
   aggregates. Iron cations (Fe2+ and Fe3+) bind strongly and induce the
   formation of large CPE aggregates. This is believed to be because of the
   propensity of these metals to bind to six ligands and thus bridge two of
   the triacid units on adjacent PPE-(CO2)-C-d chains. A comparison between
   the Stern-Volmer (SV) fluorescence quenching and the relative diffusion
   time change from FCS demonstrates that the most efficient SV quenching
   is observed for the ions that give rise to large increases in FCS
   diffusion time, underscoring the importance of ion-induced aggregation
   in the amplified quenching effect.}},

Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{Building on previous charge-optimized many-body (COMB) potentials for
   metallic alpha-U and gaseous O-2, we have developed a new potential for
   UO2, which also allows the simulation of U-UO2-O-2 systems. The UO2
   lattice parameter, elastic constants and formation energies of
   stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric intrinsic defects are well
   reproduced. Moreover, this is the first rigid-ion potential that
   produces the correct deviation of the Cauchy relation, as well as the
   first classical interatomic potential that is able to determine the
   defect energies of non-stoichiometric intrinsic point defects in UO2
   with an appropriate reference state. The oxygen molecule interstitial in
   the alpha-U structure is shown to decompose, with some U-O bonds
   approaching the natural bond length of perfect UO2. Finally, we
   demonstrate the capability of this COMB potential to simulate a complex
   system by performing a simulation of the alpha-U + O-2 -> UO2 phase
   transformation. We also identify a possible mechanism for uranium
   oxidation and the orientation of the resulting fluorite UO2 structure
   relative to the coordinate system of orthorhombic alpha-U.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze currents of 30 positive flashes recorded on the Santis tower,
   Switzerland, from May 2010 to January 2012. The currents were classified
   into two types. Type 1 events exhibit a large, unipolar main pulse with
   a risetime of tens of microseconds, followed by subsidiary peaks
   separated by millisecond-scale intervals. The main pulse in three
   flashes was preceded by a slowly rising ramp lasting several
   milliseconds and was followed by a relatively steady current with
   superimposed positive and negative pulses, constituting the first direct
   evidence of M components of both polarities. In four of the five type 1
   flashes, the main current was preceded by pulse bursts, presumably due
   to attempted negative leaders. Type 2 events are characterized by a
   millisecond-scale waveform with large, oscillatory pulse trains on its
   rising portion. These pulse trains are inferred to be due to upward
   negative stepped leaders. Peak currents of type 2 flashes are associated
   with the fast pulses. Our positive flashes of both types have a median
   peak current of 11.1 kA and a median duration of 80ms, consistent with
   data recorded in Austria. Our measured median transferred charges are
   about 6 times larger than those at Switzerland's Monte San Salvatore and
   in Japan and about 3 times larger than in Austria. Eight type 2 flashes
   in our data set transported over 500 C of positive charge to ground. Our
   five type 1 events appear to be similar (except for the pulse duration)
   to their counterparts examined by Berger et al. (1975). Our type 2
   events are classical upward flashes.}},

Abstract = {{Lightning Mapping Array source locations, channel base currents, and
   electric field waveforms are presented for a lightning flash triggered
   in the rainbands of 2012 tropical storm Debby. The National Lightning
   Detection Network reported no natural cloud-to-ground discharges within
   60km of the North Florida triggering site for at least 20h before and 8h
   after the triggered flash. Additionally, local electric field mill and
   wideband antenna networks show no close cloud or cloud-to-ground
   flashes. The triggering rocket was launched with negative charge
   overhead producing an electric field at the ground of 5kVm(-1) and in
   coordination with X-band, dual-polarimetric radar observations of
   streamers of enhanced precipitation descending from the melting level as
   they approached the site. The Debby flash consisted of an initial stage
   (IS) followed by eleven leader/return stroke sequences. The flash
   exhibited all the processes of normal triggered and natural
   cloud-to-ground lightning: leader/return stroke sequences, continuing
   currents, K events, and M components. Additionally, the flash exhibited
   several exceptional characteristics: three return stroke peak currents
   greater than 25 kA, one very long, 352ms, continuing current that
   transferred about 35 C of charge to ground, and a relatively short,
   202ms, IS containing no initial continuous current pulses. Following a
   near-vertical upward positive leader attaining 2.8km height, the IS
   branched and propagated horizontally at 3.5km altitude. The flash,
   exhibiting strokes and continuing current, then ascended to and
   propagated horizontally at 5.5km, extending about 25km south and 15km
   east. The 0 degrees C level was near 4.5km above sea level. It follows
   from the above that clouds that are not producing natural lightning can
   represent a triggered lightning hazard to launch vehicles and aircraft.}},

   alloys were studied at the end of 70\% state-of-charge cycle life
   testing (reaching below 3.1 Ah capacity in a 5.5 Ah design cell) by the
   combination of inductively coupled plasma, scanning electron microscope,
   X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy and composition mapping, and Xray
   diffraction analysis. The capacity degradation of cell with AB(5) alloy
   was found to have been caused by the combination of metal hydride alloy
   oxidation and non-reversible gamma-NiOOH phase formation, which was
   promoted by the incorporation of Al leached out from the oxidation
   product of the Al-containing negative electrode. In the cell with
   Al-free A(2)B(7) alloy, the end of cycle life was the result of
   pulverization in the main A(2)B(7) phase. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Solar radiation has been declining across many parts of the world over
   the last 50 years as a consequence of industrialization increasing
   atmospheric aerosols, known as `global dimming'. This study evaluates
   the impact of `global dimming' and climate change on wheat yield and
   water use in China during the past decades using the Agricultural
   Production Systems Simulator. Three regions, Beijing, Chengdu and Urumqi
   were selected to represent three different patterns of climate-light
   environments in China. The decline in solar radiation was in conjunction
   with a warming trend during the past decades. Solar radiation during the
   wheat season declined by 20,27 and 10\% at Beijing, Chengdu and Urumqi,
   respectively, during the past four decades. Minimum temperature
   increased during the same period by 3.9, 1.5 and 2.3 degrees C,
   respectively. The reduction in solar radiation had no significant impact
   on simulated wheat yields in the Beijing region while simulated grain
   yields in the Chengdu region decreased by 32\%. Variation of solar
   radiation explained 74\% of changes in grain yield at Chengdu. Simulated
   grain yields in the Urumqi region increased by 24\% during the last
   decades due to increasing minimum temperature and rainfall. Simulated
   evapotranspiration declined with the decline of solar radiation. Water
   use efficiency increased at Beijing and Urumqi, with no significant
   change at Chengdu. Declining solar radiation from high radiation levels
   had no effect on wheat yield but improved water use efficiency, while
   under low radiation levels grain yields decreased significantly. (C)

Title = {{Ex Vivo Pathomechanics of the Canine Pond-Nuki Model}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Transection of the canine cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) is
   a well-established osteoarthritis (OA) model. The effect of CCL loss on
   contact pressure and joint alignment has not been quantified for stifle
   loading in standing. The purposes of the study were to measure
   femorotibial contact areas and stresses and joint alignment following
   transection of the CCL in an ex vivo model. We hypothesized that
   transection of the CCL would lead to abnormal kinematics, as well as
   alterations in contact mechanics of the femorotibial joint.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Eight canine hindlimbs were tested in a
   servo-hydraulic materials testing machine using a custom made femoral
   jig. Contact area and pressure measurements, and femorotibial rotations
   and translations were measured in the normal and the CCL-deficient
   stifle in both standing and deep flexion angles. We found that at
   standing angle, transection of the CCL caused cranial translation and
   internal rotation of the tibia with a concurrent caudal shift of the
   contact area, an increase in peak pressure and a decrease in contact
   area. These changes were not noted in deep flexion. At standing, loss of
   CCL caused a redistribution of the joint pressure, with the caudal
   region of the compartment being overloaded and the rest of the joint
   being underloaded.
   Conclusion: In the Pond-Nuki model alterations in joint alignment are
   correlated with shifting of the contact points to infrequently loaded
   areas of the tibial plateau. The results of this study suggest that this
   cadaveric Pond-Nuki model simulates the biomechanical changes previously
   reported in the in-vivo Pond-Nuki model.}},

Abstract = {{Although graphene oxide (GO) has been used in many applications to
   improve human life quality, its environmental fate and behavior are
   still largely unknown. In this work, a novel approach that combines
   experimental measurements and theoretical calculations was used to
   determine the aggregation kinetics of GO sheets in aqueous solutions
   under different chemistry conditions (e.g., cation valence and pH).
   Experimental data showed that both cation valence and pH showed
   significant effect on the aggregation of GO sheets. The measured
   critical coagulation concentrations were in good agreement with the
   predictions of the extended Schulze-Hardy rule. Ca2+ and Mg2+ were more
   effective than Na+ in aggregating the GO sheets, which could be
   attributed to the cross-linking between GO sheets by the divalent
   cations through ``bridging{''} the functional groups at the edges of the
   GO sheets. When solution pH increases, deprotonation of carboxylic
   groups was found to play a key role in increasing GO sheet stability and
   surface charge development. These results suggested that edge-to-edge
   and face-to-face interactions were the dominant modes of GO aggregation
   in the presence of divalent metal ions and H+, respectively. A modified
   attachment efficiency (alpha) model was developed on the basis of the
   Maxwell approach with considerations of both primary and secondary
   minima. The model predictions matched the experimental measurements of
   the aggregation kinetics of GO sheets in aqueous solutions under all of
   the tested experimental conditions well.}},

Abstract = {{As an alternative adaptation criterion, the minimum error entropy (MEE)
   criterion has been receiving increasing attention due to its successful
   use in, especially, nonlinear and non-Gaussian signal processing. In
   this paper, we study the application of error entropy minimization to
   kernel adaptive filtering, a new and promising technique that implements
   the conventional linear adaptive filters in reproducing kernel Hilbert
   space (RKHS) and obtains the nonlinear adaptive filters in original
   input space. The kernel minimum error entropy (KMEE) algorithm is
   derived, which is essentially a generalized stochastic information
   gradient (SIG) algorithm in RKHS. The computational complexity of KMEE
   is just similar to the kernel affine projection algorithm (KAPA). We
   also utilize the quantization approach to constrain the network size
   growth, and develop the quantized KMEE (QKMEE) algorithm. Further, we
   analyze the mean square convergence of KMEE. The energy conservation
   relation is derived and a sufficient condition that ensures the mean
   square convergence is obtained. The performance of the new algorithm is
   demonstrated in nonlinear system identification and short-term chaotic
   time series prediction. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{111}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC 6}},
Abstract = {{Extremely-low-frequency (ELF, 3-3000 Hz) and very-low-frequency (VLF,
   3-30 kHz) waves generated by the excitation of the thermal cubic
   nonlinearity are observed for the first time at the High-Frequency
   Active Auroral Research Program high-frequency transmitter in Gakona,
   Alaska. The observed ELF and VLF field amplitudes are the strongest
   generated by any high frequency (HF, 3-30 MHz) heating facility using
   this mechanism to date. This manner of ELF and VLF generation is
   independent of naturally forming currents, such as the auroral
   electrojet current system. Time-of-arrival analysis applied to
   experimental observations shows that the thermal cubic ELF and VLF
   source region is located within the collisional D-region ionosphere.
   Observations are compared with the predictions of a theoretical HF
   heating model using perturbation theory. For the experiments performed,
   two X-mode HF waves were transmitted at frequencies omega(1) and
   omega(2), with vertical bar omega(2) - 2 omega(1)vertical bar being in
   the ELF and VLF frequency range. In contrast with previous work, we
   determine that the ELF and VLF source is dominantly produced by the
   interaction between collision frequency oscillations at frequency
   omega(2) - omega(1) and the polarization current density associated with
   the lower frequency HF wave at frequency omega(1). This specific
   interaction has been neglected in past cubic thermal nonlinearity work,
   and it plays a major role in the generation of ELF and VLF waves.}},

Abstract = {{This work discusses the role of gravity on the Faraday instability, and
   the differences one can expect to observe in a low-gravity experiment

   in the context of the viscous linear theory for laterally infinite

   crossover frequency where an interface in low gravity switches from
   being less to more stable than an earth-based system. We propose this
   crossover exists in all Faraday systems, and the frequency at which it
   occurs is shown to be strongly influenced by layer height. In presenting

Abstract = {{The development of watershed models with minimal quantified uncertainty
   under nonstationary conditions is a major challenge in the field of
   hydrology. This is especially problematic in data-poor areas where
   values for model inputs are lacking or measured on temporally and/or
   spatially sparse scales. The objective of this work is to conduct a
   global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis (GSA/UA) of the Pitman
   semidistributed hydrologic model for the data-poor Okavango Basin in
   southern Africa under both stationary and climate change scenarios. The
   Morris GSA method allowed qualitative ranking of important model inputs
   whereas the variance-based Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (FAST)
   method quantitatively identified the parametric uncertainty and
   sensitivity to these inputs. Results showed that the most important
   model inputs determining mean annual flow and model fit to observed data
   were the infiltration rate and the temporal rainfall distribution. In
   addition, the wetter western headwaters region was shown to be the most
   important region in determining the flow at the outlet of the basin.
   Parameter equifinality was significant in this study, and hence the
   evaluation of the relationships between mechanisms was not
   straightforward. Analysis of model results under climate change
   scenarios showed that a hot and wet scenario introduced more change in
   mean annual flow than a hot and dry scenario. The climate change
   scenarios also altered model sensitivity. For example, the parameter
   that controls the rate of infiltration decreased in importance and the
   parameter that controls soil moisture storage gained importance under
   the dry scenario. These results are useful when determining the
   applicability of model predictions under stationary and nonstationary
   conditions and when focusing watershed monitoring efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Flow control actuators based on a small-diameter source jet and a
   cylindrical cavity structure take advantage of the flow resonance within
   the cylindrical cavity to generate a variable-frequency, pulsed
   high-momentum microjet issuing through the cavity orifice. The
   flow-acoustic coupling, which leads to resonance within the cavity of
   the actuator, is the main driving mechanism behind the pulsed microjet.
   In the present study, a computational methodology based on high-order
   numerical techniques is used to simulate a highly unsteady and
   compressible pulsed actuator flowfield. Simulation generated flowfield
   results are analyzed to further understand the complex flow physics
   governing the pulsed actuator operation. The simulation provides
   significant details about the highly unsteady and complex microscale
   actuator flowfield, which are not observable from the experiments.
   Qualitative comparisons made between the simulated flowfield
   visualizations and the experimental microschlieren images show a
   reasonable level of agreement. We perform a dynamic mode decomposition
   to identify the dynamically important modes of the actuator flowfield.
   The additional insight gained into the flow physics through the
   simulation is useful in the design of more efficient and geometrically
   complex pulsed actuators for a range of high-speed flow and noise
   control applications.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The objective of this project was to perform a
   cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of immediately sequential bilateral
   cataract surgery (ISBCS) versus delayed sequential bilateral cataract
   surgery (DSBCS) to determine whether ISBCS represents an appropriate,
   cost-effective way to rapidly rehabilitate a patient's visual
   impairment.
   Design: A systematic review followed by a primary economic analysis with
   computer-based econometric modeling.
   Participants: Not applicable.
   Methods: We constructed a decision analytic model from the perspective
   of the public third-party payer (i.e., the Ministry of Health) to
   conduct a CEA of both surgeries, ISBCS and DSBCS. Cost data consisted of
   the costs of the surgery, intravitreal injections, medications, and
   drops, all of which were obtained from a comprehensive literature search
   and from records at St. Joseph's Hospital, London, Ont. The
   effectiveness was measured by the utility values associated with visual
   acuity in the better seeing eye.
   Results: ISBCS resulted in an incremental effectiveness of 0.08 utility
   at an incremental cost of \$1607. Discounting the qualityadjusted
   life-years (QALYs) gained by an annual interest rate of 3\% resulted in
   0.932 QALYs gained. The cost-effectiveness of ISBCS was calculated to be
   \$1431 per QALY gained. A 1-way sensitivity analysis was performed by
   varying costs, utility values, probabilities, and discounting rates.
   This analysis varied the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio but did
   not change the conclusion.
   Conclusions: Health economics assessment showed that, compared with
   DSBCS, ISBCS is a cost-effective procedure. This finding will be highly
   useful to policy-makers, decision-makers, clinicians, hospital
   administrators, and payers in making cost-efficient decisions.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of
   mobile-bearing implant design and activity on knee arthroplasty
   kinematics during three activities of daily living.
   Methods: In vivo kinematics were analyzed using 3D model registration
   from fluoroscopic images of non-weightbearing knee flexion-extension,
   weight-bearing squatting and stair activities in 20 knees in 10 patients
   with bilateral total knee arthroplasty. Each patient had one
   rotating-platform and one meniscal-bearing variant of the same
   prosthesis design.
   Results: Anteroposterior translations in meniscal-bearing knees were
   larger than those in rotating-platform knees for the different dynamic
   conditions. Meniscal-bearing knees showed more posterior femoral
   locations with activities that increased demand on the quadriceps.
   Condylar translations changed little in rotating-platform knees with
   different activities.
   Conclusions: Activity dynamics can have a significant influence on knee
   kinematics, and have a greater effect on the kinematics of unconstrained
   meniscal-bearing prostheses than rotating-platform knee prostheses. (C)

   and desorber processes. Studies on the absorption process were focused
   on the effects of water vapor pressure, cooling water temperature, and
   the solution velocity on the absorption rate. Desorption studies were
   conducted on the effects of wall temperature, vapor and solution

Abstract = {{Deconstructing the drivers of large-scale vegetation change is critical
   to predicting and managing projected climate and land use changes that
   will affect regional vegetation cover in degraded or threated
   ecosystems. We investigate the shared dynamics of spatially variable
   vegetation across three large watersheds in the southern Africa savanna.
   Dynamic Factor Analysis (DFA), a multivariate time-series dimension
   reduction technique, was used to identify the most important physical
   drivers of regional vegetation change. We first evaluated the Advanced
   Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)- vs. the Moderate Resolution
   Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based Normalized Difference Vegetation
   Index (NDVI) datasets across their overlapping period (2001-2010). NDVI
   follows a general pattern of cyclic seasonal variation, with distinct
   spatio-temporal patterns across physio-geographic regions. Both NDVI
   products produced similar DFA models, although MODIS was simulated
   better. Soil moisture and precipitation controlled NDVI for mean annual
   precipitation (MAP) < 750 mm, and above this, evaporation and mean
   temperature dominated. A second DFA with the full AVHRR (1982-2010) data
   found that for MAP < 750 mm, soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration
   control NDVI dynamics, followed by mean and maximum temperatures. Above
   950 mm, actual evapotranspiration and precipitation dominate. The
   quantification of the combined spatio-temporal environmental drivers of
   NDVI expands our ability to understand landscape level changes in
   vegetation evaluated through remote sensing and improves the basis for
   the management of vulnerable regions, like the southern Africa savannas.}},

Abstract = {{Compared to the classical barcode system, radio frequency identification
   (RFID) extends the operational distance from inches to a number of feet
   (passive RFID tags) or even hundreds of feet (active RFID tags). Their
   wireless transmission, processing, and storage capabilities enable them
   to support full automation of many inventory management functions in
   industry. This paper studies the practically important problem of
   monitoring a large set of active RFID tags and identifying the missing
   ones-the objects that the missing tags are associated with are likely to
   be missing as well. This monitoring function may need to be executed
   frequently and therefore should be made efficient in terms of execution
   time in order to avoid disruption of normal inventory operations. Based
   on probabilistic methods, we design a series of missing-tag
   identification protocols that employ novel techniques to reduce the
   execution time. Our best protocol reduces the time for detecting the
   missing tags by an order of magnitude when compared to existing
   protocols.}},

Abstract = {{When hot mix asphalt (HMA) overlays are placed on distressed flexible or
   rigid pavement, it is only a matter of time before cracks in existing
   pavement reflect to the new overlay surface. Asphalt rubber membrane
   interlayer (ARMI) is one type of interlayer system that has been
   suggested to mitigate reflective cracking in HMA overlay. However, in
   terms of reflective cracking performance, mixed results were reported.
   Also, the ARMI layer has the potential to contribute to instability
   rutting. In this study, composite specimen interface cracking (CSIC)
   tests were performed on composite specimens constructed with and without
   the ARMI layer to evaluate its effects on HMA overlay reflective
   cracking performance. HMA fracture mechanics was employed to
   characterize the mechanism of ARMI layer effects on HMA overlay
   reflective cracking resistance. Results indicate that ARMI not only
   cannot delay reflective cracking, but it also reduces reflective
   cracking resistance to some extent. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) devices are known ozone generators.
   Authors have previously demonstrated a DBD surface plasma source,
   operating in air at atmospheric pressure, to achieve killing of
   vegetative cells in 2-3min and sterilization in 20min (bacterial
   spores). The aim of this paper is to examine the role of the ozone in
   surface DBD plasma sterilization. The role of ozone in plasma killing is
   examined by a) characterizing the rate of production/decay of ozone
   during DBD plasma generation, b) studying the effect of exposing
   bacteria (Escherichia coli) solely to the ozone thus produced. Our
   results indicate that while ozone plays a major role, the energy flux
   delivered to the electrodes is also crucial in the process of plasma
   sterilization.}},

Abstract = {{A field evaluation of cracking performance was undertaken for 10
   pavement sections as part of a long-term Superpave monitoring project.
   It was found that top-down cracking was the major type of cracking.
   Also, moisture damage was identified in four of these sections. An
   analysis based on the energy ratio (ER) parameter showed that the
   mixtures that were affected by moisture generally exhibited a much
   faster reduction in the ER (indicating reduced fracture resistance) than
   those that were not. Further analysis of cracking performance was
   conducted using the enhanced hot mix asphalt fracture mechanics-based
   pavement performance model (HMA-FM-E). The HMA-FM-E is capable of
   predicting the entire process of top-down cracking from the onset of
   cracking until pavement failure, and thus provides more valuable
   information that may better assist material and pavement engineers to
   optimise their designs. The results showed that the predictions for
   sections not affected by moisture generally agreed well with field
   observations. More importantly, it was identified that the key to
   further improve the accuracy of the performance model is to more
   accurately predict changes of mixture properties affected by moisture in
   addition to oxidative ageing.}},

Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{It is now well recognised that microdamage healing may extend the
   fatigue life of asphalt pavement. In this study, a test was developed to
   quantify the healing of asphalt mixture, both dense-graded and
   open-graded, using the Superpave(TM) Indirect Tensile Test testing
   system. The healing test consists of repeated load damage tests
   (resilient modulus tests) during the damage phase followed by a healing
   phase during which resilient modulus tests are performed on a limited
   basis to measure modulus recovery (healing). Appropriate load level, as
   percentage of tensile strength, for the damage phase was found to depend
   on mixture brittleness index. A decrease in resilient modulus with an
   increasing number of load cycles is indicative of accumulation of
   microdamage during the damage phase. Recovery of resilient modulus
   during the healing phase is indicative of damage recovery or healing.
   Rate of healing was found to not be constant but rather changed with
   time at a decreasing rate for any given mixture. Therefore, a healing
   rate parameter was defined to allow for comparison between mixtures.
   Results showed that, in general, expected trends were observed. Mixtures
   tested at higher temperatures healed at a faster rate than those at
   lower temperatures and mixtures subjected to less oxidative ageing
   healed at faster rates than those subjected to more oxidative ageing.}},

Abstract = {{The commercialization of sensor-based platforms is facilitating the
   realization of numerous sensor network applications with diverse
   application requirements. However, sensor network platforms are becoming
   increasingly complex to design and optimize due to the multitude of
   interdependent parameters that must be considered. To further complicate
   matters, application experts oftentimes are not trained engineers, but
   rather biologists, teachers, or agriculturists who wish to utilize the
   sensor-based platforms for various domain-specific tasks. To assist both
   platform developers and application experts, we present a centralized
   dynamic profiling and optimization platform for sensor-based systems
   that enables application experts to rapidly optimize a sensor network
   for a particular application without requiring extensive knowledge of,
   and experience with, the underlying physical hardware platform. In this
   article, we present an optimization framework that allows developers to
   characterize application requirements through high-level design metrics
   and fuzzy-logic-based optimization. We further analyze the benefits of
   utilizing dynamic profiling information to eliminate the guesswork of
   creating a ``good{''} benchmark, present several reoptimization
   evaluation algorithms used to detect if re-optimization is necessary,
   and highlight the benefits of the proposed dynamic optimization
   framework compared to static optimization alternatives.}},

Abstract = {{Even though the behavior of collagen monomers self-assembling into
   fibrils is commonly understood in terms of hydrophobic and electrostatic
   interactions, the mechanisms that drive their ordered, longitudinal
   alignment to form a characteristic periodicity are still unclear. By
   introducing various salts into the collagen fibrillogenesis system, the
   intermolecular interactions of fibril formation were studied. We found
   that the pH and ion species play a critical role in forming native
   fibrils. Turbidity and electron microscopy revealed that collagen
   self-assembled into fibrils with a native banding pattern in the
   presence of multivalent ions. The isoelectric point of collagen in 12 mM
   of NaCl is pH 8.9; it shifted to pH 9.4 and pH 7.0 after adding 10 mM
   CaCl2 and Na2SO4, respectively. Native fibrils were reconstituted at pH
   7.4 in salts with divalent anions and at pH 9.0 in salts with divalent
   cations. Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed a loss of helicity in
   the conditions where fibrillogenesis was unable to be achieved. The
   multivalent ions not only change the surface charge of collagen, but
   also facilitate the formation of fibrils with the native D-periodic
   banding pattern. It is likely that the binding multivalent ions induce
   the like-charge attraction and facilitate monomers' longitudinal
   registration to form fibrils with the native banding. Published by
   Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{An atypical distribution of steroids occurred in oilsand and oil samples
   in the Jinxian Sag, Bohai Bay Basin, northern China. It is featured by
   usually abundant C-21-C-26 short-chain steranes that are derived from
   the cleavage of the weak C-S bonds at the C-17 and C-20 positions.
   Sulfur-containing petroleum biomarkers were further analyzed in these
   sulfur-rich heavy oils by comprehensive two-dimensional gas
   chromatography (GC X GC) using sulfur-specific detection to locate and
   confirm sulfur species and GC X GC time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF
   MS) to identify previously unknown sulfur-containing biomarkers.
   Preliminary GC-MS analysis revealed a series of compounds yielding
   characteristic fragment ions consistent with thiophenic substructures.
   For confirmation, GC X GC-sulfur chemiluminescence detection (SCD) was
   used to confirm the sulfur moiety. The molecular structures of sulfur
   biomarkers were proposed as unsaturated isoprenoid thiophenes based on
   fragmentation patterns observed in their 70 eV electron-impact
   ionization (El) mass spectra. There were constant neutral losses of 71
   and 111 Da from the molecular ions in the 70 eV El mass spectra
   throughout a whole series. The endeavor of sulfur-containing biomarker
   characterization may provide some clues of paleotransformation of
   biological precursors and geological products in oil/kerogen under
   thermal stress during burial and resolve some missing links between the
   biosphere and the geosphere.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring of Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae)
   populations is an important component of efforts to reduce damage caused
   by huanglongbing, a devastating disease it vectors in citrus groves.
   Currently, D. citri is monitored primarily by unbaited sticky traps or
   visual inspection of trees. A potentially more effective method might
   result from attracting males to vibrational communications produced by
   females. Males call with wing-buzzing substrate-borne vibrations while
   searching for females on tree branches and stems. When nearby receptive
   females detect the calls, they reply immediately in synchronized duets
   that help direct the males towards them. The spectral and temporal
   patterns of the duets have been analyzed in previous studies and have
   been mimicked successfully with computer-operated vibration exciters.
   Males and females both respond to signals produced by either sex but
   display different behaviors during duets. To devise practical methods to
   attract and trap males with vibrational signals in field environments, a
   microcontroller platform was tested for capability to control
   inexpensive vibration sensing and output devices. The microcontroller
   was programmed to send mimics of different D. citri signals to a piezo
   buzzer for substrate-borne broadcast. A mimic that elicited strong
   female responses was tested in bioassays that jointly compared it with
   other previously bioassayed signals, and the response to the mimic was
   found to be statistically comparable to that elicited by a recorded male
   call. The successful result suggests there is opportunity to develop
   microcontroller systems further as a means of trapping psyllids.}},

Abstract = {{A combination of TRIM and FLOODS models the effect of radiation damage
   on AlGaN/GaN HEMTs. While excellent fits are obtained for threshold
   voltage shift, the models do not fully explain the increased reliability
   observed experimentally. In short, the addition of negatively-charged
   traps in the GaN buffer layer does not significantly change the electric
   field at the gate edges at radiation fluence levels seen in this study.
   We propose that negative trapped charge at the nitride/AlGaN interface
   actually produces the virtual-gate effect that results in decreasing the
   magnitude of the electric field at the gate edges and thus the increase
   in critical voltage. Simulation results including nitride interface
   charge show significant changes in electric field profiles while the I-V
   device characteristics do not change.}},

Abstract = {{The impacts of four common animal husbandry antibiotics (ampicillin,
   florfenicol, sulfamethazine, and tylosin) on anaerobic digestion (AD)
   treatment efficiency and the potential for antibiotic degradation during
   digestion were evaluated. Sulfamethazine and ampicillin exhibited no
   impact on total biogas production up to 280 and 350 mg/L, respectively,
   although ampicillin inhibited biogas production rates during early
   stages of AD. Tylosin reduced biogas production by 10-38\% between 130
   and 913 mg/L. Florfenicol reduced biogas by similar to 5\%, 40\% and
   75\% at 6.4, 36 and 210 mg/L, respectively. These antibiotic
   concentrations are higher than commonly seen for mixed feedlot manure,
   so impacts on full scale AD should be minimal. Antibiotic degradation
   products were found, confirming AD effectively degraded ampicillin,
   florfenicol, and tylosin, although some products were persistent
   throughout the process. Contamination of AD solid and liquid effluents
   with sulfamethazine and antibiotic transformation products from
   florfenicol and tylosin could present an environmental concern.

Abstract = {{Laypeople and healthcare professionals use demographic cues when making
   pain management decisions. These decisions can negatively affect patient
   outcomes. This study examined whether laypeople base their pain
   management decisions in part on pain-related postures and demographic
   cues. Virtual human (VH) technology was used to research whether sex and
   race, as well as body posture, influenced pain management decisions.
   Ninety-seven laypersons examined VH patients exhibiting low back pain
   related body postures whose demographic cues varied by VH sex and VH
   race. T tests validated that participants were able to distinguish
   between high pain related body postures and low pain related body
   postures. The participants assessed male VH patients to be experiencing
   more pain than female VH patients. This study suggests that participants
   use sex as a cue when assessing pain. Participants may perceive VH male
   patients as experiencing high pain intensity if the participants are
   willing to counter male stereotypes and acknowledge that the male VH
   patients display pain behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{This brief presents a majority-voting 1-tap speculative
   decision-feedback equalization (DFE) architecture wherein the
   current-mode-logic (CML) selector after the slicers is replaced with a
   CML majority voter with two instead of three transistors in the stack,
   thereby resulting in improved speed and increased voltage headroom (or
   lower supply voltage operation). Compared with the traditional CML
   selector, the majority voter shows around 50\% delay reduction at the
   same bias conditions and 25\% reduction in supply. A receiver with the
   proposed majority-voting DFE is implemented in 0.13-mu m CMOS process.
   With the DFE enabled, the receiver is able to equalize a 20-in channel
   over an FR4 board with 22-dB Nyquist loss at 4.5 Gb/s. The whole
   receiver core occupies 0.14 mm(2) and consumes 12.4 mW.}},

Abstract = {{About a half a century has passed since dopamine was identified as a
   neurotransmitter, and it has been several decades since it was
   established that people with Parkinson's disease receive motor symptom
   relief from oral levodopa. Despite the evidence that levodopa can reduce
   motor symptoms, there has been a developing body of literature that
   dopaminergic therapy can improve cognitive functions in some patients
   but make them worse in others. Over the past two decades, several
   laboratories have shown that dopaminergic medications can impair the
   action of intact neural structures and impair the behaviors associated
   with these structures. In this review, we consider the evidence that has
   accumulated in the areas of reversal learning, motor sequence learning,
   and other cognitive tasks. The purported inverted-U shaped relationship
   between dopamine levels and performance is complex and includes many
   contributory factors. The regional striatal topography of nigrostriatal
   denervation is a critical factor, as supported by multimodal
   neuroimaging studies. A patient's individual genotype will determine the
   relative baseline position on this inverted-U curve. Dopaminergic
   pharmacotherapy and individual gene polymorphisms can affect the
   mesolimbic and prefrontal cortical dopaminergic functions in a
   comparable, inverted-U dose-response relationship. Depending on these
   factors, a patient can respond positively or negatively to levodopa when
   performing reversal learning and motor sequence learning tasks. These
   tasks may continue to be relevant as our society moves to increased
   technological demands of a digital world that requires newly learned
   motor sequences and adaptive behaviors to manage daily life activities.

Abstract = {{Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is a prescribed treatment
   for various neuromuscular disorders, where an electrical stimulus is
   provided to elicit a muscle contraction. Barriers to the development of
   NMES controllers exist because the muscle response to an electrical
   stimulation is nonlinear and the muscle model is uncertain. Efforts in
   this paper focus on the development of an adaptive inverse optimal NMES
   controller. The controller yields desired limb trajectory tracking while
   simultaneously minimizing a cost functional that is positive in the
   error states and stimulation input. The development of this framework
   allows tradeoffs to be made between tracking performance and control
   effort by putting different penalties on error states and control input,
   depending on the clinical goal or functional task. The controller is
   examined through a Lyapunov-based analysis. Experiments on able-bodied
   individuals are provided to demonstrate the performance of the developed
   controller.}},

   a drop of water) on the electrospun poly(N-isoporpylacrylamide)
   (PNIPA)/polystyrene (PS) fiber mats of 380, 990, and 1500nm diameter
   fibers was found to be 4-5s; whereas, on the 16 mu m diameter fiber it
   was more than five times slower. While the reported switching times were
   limited by the experimental design, they are in the micro- to
   millisecond for fiber diameters ranging between 100 and 500nm, in
   theory. The temperature-dependent-switch in CA values is attributed to
   the hydrogen bonding capability of PNIPA with water. The closer to
   superhydrophobic CA values at 65 degrees C was successfully described by
   the Cassie-Baxter (CB) state equation. The superhydrophilicity at RT was
   explained by hydrogen bonding as well as capillary forces provided by
   the fiber mat. The variations in the larger fibers' changes are
   attributed to lower surface area with reduced capillary driving forces

   potential}},
Journal = {{MECHANICS RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{54}},
Pages = {{21-26}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Modeling of ductile damage is generally done using analytical
   potentials, which are expressed in the stress space. In this paper, for
   the first time it is shown that strain-rate potentials which are exact
   conjugate of the stress-based potentials can be instead used to model
   the dilatational response of porous polycrystals. A new integration
   algorithm is also developed. It is to be noted that a strain-rate based
   formulation is most appropriate when the plastic flow of the matrix is
   described by a criterion that involves dependence on all stress
   invariants. In such cases, although a strain-rate potential is known,
   the stress-based potential cannot be obtained explicitly. While the
   proposed framework based on strain-rate potentials is general, for
   comparison purposes in this work we present an illustration of the
   approach for the case of a porous solid with von Mises matrix containing
   randomly distributed spherical cavities. Comparison between simulations
   using the strain-rate based approach and the classical stress-based
   Gurson's criterion in uniaxial tension is presented. These results show
   that the model based on a strain-rate potential predicts the
   dilatational response with the same level of accuracy. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We present an in situ high-temperature confocal laser microscopy study
   on the thermal stability of 40 nm thick gold thin films grown on 40 nm
   Ti, TiOx and ZnO adhesion layers on (0 0 1) Si. In situ observation of
   the dewetting process was performed over a wide range of set
   temperatures (400-800 degrees C) and ramp rates (10-50 degrees C
   min(-1)) for each gold/adhesion layer combination. We found that
   significant dewetting and subsequent formation of gold islands occurs
   only at and above 700 degrees C for all adhesion layers. The dewetting
   is driven to equilibrium for gold/ZnO compared to gold/Ti and gold/TiOx
   as confirmed by ex situ X-ray diffraction and scanning electron
   microscopy characterization. Quantification of the in situ data through
   stretched exponential kinetic models reveals an underlying apparent
   activation energy of the dewetting process. This energy barrier for
   dewetting is higher for gold/Ti and gold/TiOx compared to gold/ZnO, thus
   confirming the ex situ observations. We rationalize that these apparent
   activation energies correspond to the underlying thermal stability of
   each gold/adhesion layer system. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published

Volume = {{211}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers a two-stage supply chain in which a supplier serves
   a set of stores in a retail chain. We consider a two-stage Stackelberg
   game in which the supplier must set price discounts for each period of a
   finite planning horizon under uncertainty in retail-store demand. As a
   mechanism to stimulate sales, the supplier offers periodic off-invoice
   price discounts to the retail chain. Based on the price discounts
   offered by the supplier, and after store demand uncertainty is resolved,
   the retail chain determines individual store order quantities in each
   period. Because the supplier offers store-specific prices, the retailer
   may ship inventory between stores, a practice known as diverting. We
   demonstrate that, despite the resulting bullwhip effect and associated
   costs, a carefully designed price promotion scheme can improve the
   supplier's profit when compared to the case of everyday low pricing
   (EDLP). We model this problem as a stochastic bilevel optimization
   problem with a bilinear objective at each level and with linear
   constraints. We provide an exact solution method based on a

Abstract = {{This paper presents an analysis of a spatial tensegrity-based mechanism.
   In this study, a moving body in space is joined to ground by seven
   compliant leg connectors. Each leg connector is comprised of a spring in
   series with an adjustable piston. The mechanism is said to be
   `tensegrity-based' in that it is prestressed when at equilibrium due to
   compliant linear elements. Two problems are solved in this paper; the
   reverse kinetostatic analysis and stiffness synthesis problems. In the
   first problem, the values of the seven spring constants and free lengths
   are given and the lengths of the seven pistons are determined such that:
   (1) the top body is given at a desired pose; (2) the top body is at
   equilibrium while a specified external wrench is applied; and (3) the
   total potential energy stored in the seven springs equals some desired
   value. In the second problem, the seven spring constants and the lengths
   of the seven pistons are determined such that conditions (1) and (2) are
   met and also the instantaneous stiffness matrix of the top body equals a
   specified set of matrix values. The paper formulates the solutions of
   these problems. Numerical examples are also presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this study, lignin recovered from a biorefinery waste stream was used
   to modify a clay saponite to form a lignin-clay nanohybrid.
   Approximately 32 wt \% of lignin was associated into a lignin-clay
   nanohybrid, which could be well dispersed into an organophilic monomer
   phase. This nanohybrid was then encapsulated into polystyrene co-butyl
   acrylate (PSBA) particles to form stable latex via in situ miniemulsion
   polymerization. The final latex had a broad size distribution and a
   narrow window of the nanohybrid (1.9-5.3 wt \%) loading level. X-ray
   powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of latex films indicated
   successful encapsulation of intercalated nanohybrids inside a copolymer
   matrix. The introduction of lignin-clay nanohybrids greatly improved
   PSBA properties. The nanocomposite with a 5.3\% nanohybrid had a 13.75
   times increase in tensile strength, an approximate 50 degrees C increase
   in degradation temperature, and a 42\% decrease in oxygen permeability.}},

Abstract = {{The ultimate scaling limit of double-gate molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)
   field-effect transistors (FETs) with a monolayer thin body is examined
   and compared with ultrathinbody Si FETs by self-consistent quantum
   transport simulation in the presence of phonon scattering. Modeling of
   phonon scattering, quantum mechanical effects, and self-consistent
   electrostatics allows us to accurately assess the performance potential
   of monolayer MoS2 FETs. The results revealed that monolayer MoS2 FETs
   show 52\% smaller drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL) and 13\% smaller
   subthreshold swing (SS) than 3-nm-thick-body Si FETs at a channel length
   of 10 nm with the same gating. With a requirement of DIBL <100 mV/V, the
   scaling limit of monolayer MoS2 FETs is assessed to be 8 nm, comparing
   with 10 nm of the ultrathin-body Si counterparts due to the monolayer
   thin body and higher effective mass, which reduces direct
   source-to-drain tunneling. By comparing with the international
   technology roadmap for semiconductor (ITRS) target for high performance
   logic devices of 2023; double-gate monolayer MoS2 FETs can fulfill the

Abstract = {{The small sample universal hypothesis testing problem is investigated in
   this paper, in which the number of samples n is smaller than the number
   of possible outcomes m. The goal of this paper is to find an appropriate
   criterion to analyze statistical tests in this setting. A suitable model
   for analysis is the high-dimensional model in which both n and m
   increase to infinity, and n = o(m). A new performance criterion based on
   large deviations analysis is proposed and it generalizes the classical
   error exponent applicable for large sample problems (in which m = O(n)).
   This generalized error exponent criterion provides insights that are not
   available from asymptotic consistency or central limit theorem analysis.
   The following results are established for the uniform null distribution:
   1) The best achievable probability of error P-e decays as P-e =
   exp\{-(n(2/)m)j(1 + o(1))\} for some j > 0. 2) A class of tests based on
   separable statistics, including the coincidence-based test, attains the
   optimal generalized error exponents. 3) Pearson's chi-square test has a
   zero generalized error exponent and thus its probability of error is
   asymptotically larger than the optimal test.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{338-351}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) lattice Boltzmann (LB) model with five
   discrete velocities in two dimensions (D2Q5) for simulating the
   axisymmetric convection-diffusion equation (CDE) is proposed. The
   axisymmetric CDE in the cylindrical coordinate system is rearranged as
   an ordinary CDE in the Cartesian coordinate system with the extra terms
   considered as additional sources. The gradient of the macroscopic scalar
   in the source terms is directly obtained from the non-equilibrium
   components of the distribution functions; thus no finite-difference
   calculation is required. The proposed model is consistent with the LB
   models for the axisymmetric hydrodynamic equations and they can be
   directly coupled. A series of numerical tests are conducted to validate
   the applicability and accuracy of the proposed model, including: (i)
   steady convection-diffusion in an annulus with mass injection on the
   boundaries, (ii) steady and transient convection-diffusion in a circular
   pipe, (iii) steady heat conduction inside a sphere, (iv) steady natural
   convection in an annulus between two coaxial vertical cylinders, and (v)
   steady swirling flows in a vertical cylindrical container. Analytical
   solutions are available for tests (i)-(iii), and the numerical results
   show that the proposed model is second-order accurate in space and
   first-order accurate in time. The surface-averaged Nusselt numbers for
   test (iv), the flow pattern and the velocity and temperature
   distributions for test (v) agree well with published results. (C) 2013

Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{955-966}},

Abstract = {{In order to provide the optimized chilldown strategy for a cryogenic
   transport line, a study on pulse flow chilldown was conducted. A
   comparison between continuous flow and pulse flow patterns on heat
   transfer characteristics was presented to reveal the effect of flow
   oscillation. Liquid nitrogen was used as the working fluid and upward
   flows with Reynolds numbers ranging from 2500 to 7000 in a round tube
   were examined. To gain a better understanding of the effect of flow
   pulsation on the chilldown process, different square wave pulse flow
   strategies were examined. Analysis of the ability of different flow
   patterns to chill down transport lines indicated that there is no single
   best strategy for all boiling regimes and Reynolds numbers. In terms of
   the efficiency, the continuous flow is optimal for most boiling regimes
   at low Reynolds numbers. On the other hand, pulse flow is ideal in the
   film boiling regime at higher Reynolds numbers. In terms of the total
   efficiency, continuous flows with high Reynolds numbers are generally
   more efficient at transferring heat than other patterns or those of
   lower Reynolds numbers. If a short chilldown duration is a priority, the
   continuous flow consistently offers the quickest chilldown times. A
   general guideline for chilldown strategy is suggested as a conclusion.

Journal = {{MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this work a cost-effective instrument for measuring the wettability
   of powder materials was designed and developed, which works on the
   modified Washburn method. The instrument measures the mass gain against
   time due to penetration of the liquid into the powder materials using a
   microbalance and LabVIEW-based data acquisition system. The wettability
   characteristic of different powders was determined from the contact
   angle using the modified Washburn equation. To demonstrate the
   performance of the developed instrument, the wettability of as-received
   corn starch and nano-coated corn starch powders was estimated with water
   as a test liquid. The corn starch powders coated with hydrophilic grade
   (Aerosil 200P) and hydrophobic grade (Aerosil R972) nanoparticles at
   different coating levels showed expected changes in their contact angle.
   Some of the results were also verified against the available standard
   instrument for wettability measurement and found to be consistent. The
   present configuration of the instrument costs about 500 US\$ which is 15
   to 20 times less than the available advanced models. The developed
   instrument is thus a cost-effective solution for wettability measurement
   which can be used for materials in food processing, pharmaceuticals,
   horticulture, textile manufacturing, civil engineering etc. The
   developed instrument is expected to help many small scale industries or
   research labs who cannot afford an expensive instrument for wettability
   studies.}},

   and cost of multimedia services. Existing studies have primarily focused
   on optimization-based algorithms to select server locations from a small
   pool of candidates based on the entire topological information and thus
   these algorithms are not scalable due to unavailability of the small
   pool of candidates and low-efficiency of gathering the topological
   information in large-scale networks. To overcome this limitation, a
   novel scalable framework called NetClust is proposed in this paper.
   NetClust takes advantage of the latest network coordinate technique to
   reduce the workloads when obtaining the global network information for
   server placement, adopts a new Kappa -means-clustering-based algorithm
   to select server locations and identify the optimal matching between
   clients and servers. The key contribution of this paper is that the
   proposed framework optimizes the trade-off between the service delay
   performance and the deployment cost under the constraints of client
   location distribution and the computing/storage/bandwidth capacity of
   each server simultaneously. To evaluate the performance of the proposed
   framework, a prototype system is developed and deployed in a real-world
   large-scale Internet. Experimental results demonstrate that 1) NetClust
   achieves the lower deployment cost and lower delay compared to the
   traditional server selection method; and 2) NetClust offers a practical
   and feasible solution for multimedia service providers.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, sparsity-based algorithms are proposed for super-resolution
   spectrum estimation. However, to achieve adequately high resolution in
   real-world signal analysis, the dictionary atoms have to be close to
   each other in frequency, thereby resulting in a coherent design. The
   popular convex compressed sensing methods break down in presence of high
   coherence and large noise. We propose a new regularization approach to
   handle model collinearity and obtain parsimonious frequency selection
   simultaneously. It takes advantage of the pairing structure of sine and
   cosine atoms in the frequency dictionary. A probabilistic spectrum
   screening is also developed for fast computation in high dimensions. A
   data-resampling version of high-dimensional Bayesian Information
   Criterion is used to determine the regularization parameters.
   Experiments show the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed algorithms
   in challenging situations with small sample size, high frequency
   resolution, and low signal-to-noise ratio.}},

Abstract = {{We present a study of linear interpolation when applied to uncertain
   data. Linear interpolation is a key step for isosurface extraction
   algorithms, and the uncertainties in the data lead to non-linear
   variations in the geometry of the extracted isosurface. We present an
   approach for deriving the probability density function of a random
   variable modeling the positional uncertainty in the isosurface
   extraction. When the uncertainty is quantified by a uniform
   distribution, our approach provides a closed-form characterization of
   the mentioned random variable. This allows us to derive, in closed form,
   the expected value as well as the variance of the level-crossing
   position. While the former quantity is used for constructing a stable
   isosurface for uncertain data, the latter is used for visualizing the
   positional uncertainties in the expected isosurface level crossings on
   the underlying grid.}},

   yttria-stabilized zirconia, synthesized via the co-precipitation method

   parameters for the thermal reduction (T-R) of CoFe2O4 at temperatures of

   best fit of a uniform conversion model was used to determine kinetic

   1375-1450A degrees C, the activation energy and preexponential term were
   found to be 386 +/- A 13 kJ mol(-1) and 8.8 x 10(9) +/- A 2.0 x 10(8)

   Simultaneous thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning
   calorimetry studies showed an increase in the reaction rate of T-R upon
   the onset of melting (1440A degrees C). Oxidation studies of the
   material using CO2 yield an activation energy and preexponential term of

   which is in good agreement with past work. The reaction order for CO2

   the emergence of AmI techniques in the healthcare domain, in order to
   provide the research community with the necessary background. We will
   examine the infrastructure and technology required for achieving the

   interaction), reasoning techniques (for reasoning about users' goals and
   intensions), and planning techniques (for planning activities and
   interactions). We will also discuss how AmI technology might support
   people affected by various physical or mental disabilities or chronic

   energy dissipation of the overall suspension. The lateral dynamics of
   the system is developed using a bicycle model. The accompanying roll
   dynamics are also developed and validated using experimental data. The
   positions of the left and right control masses are sequentially
   allocated to reduce the effective body roll and roll rate. Simulation
   results show that the resulting variable stiffness suspension system has
   more than 50\% improvement in roll response over the traditional
   constant stiffness counterparts. The simulation scenarios examined is

Abstract = {{A hybrid spectral-compact finite difference scheme for
   turbulent-resolving simulation of fine sediment transport in the bottom
   boundary layer is presented. The numerical approach extends an earlier
   pseudo-spectral model for direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulent
   flows with a sixth-order compact finite difference scheme in the
   wall-normal direction on Chebyshev grid points. The compact finite
   difference scheme allows easy implementation of flow-dependent
   properties (e.g., viscosity, diffusivity and settling velocity) and more
   flexible boundary conditions while still maintain spectral-like
   numerical accuracy. The numerical model is verified with analytical
   solutions of flow velocity and particle concentration of two simple
   Newtonian rheological closures under laminar condition. Prior laboratory
   and DNS data of turbulent channel flow are also used to validate the
   code. Several numerical simulations were carried out in a turbulent
   channel flow setting to investigate the interplay between the two
   turbulence modulation mechanisms induced by the presence of sediment,
   namely sediment-induced density stratification and enhanced viscosity
   due to rheological stress. We demonstrate that at the Reynolds number,
   Richardson number, and non-dimensional settling velocity used here, the
   flow remains turbulent but sediment-induced density stratification
   already causes noticeable damping of turbulence (drag reduction). By
   further introducing a Newtonian rheological stress into the system, flow
   turbulence is further damped by the increased effective viscosity, which
   can trigger laminarization. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides a noninvasive
   approach to characterize the fiber pathways in the human brain. Among
   the fiber tractography algorithms in DTI analysis, the fast marching
   (FM) method has been widely used in quantitatively analyzing the
   structural connectivity of the fibers and their changes. However,
   standard FM only considers the similarity and the principal direction
   information conveyed by two neighboring voxels. It may have poor
   tracking performance when image noise and fiber crossing are present. To
   solve this problem, we introduced an improved FM method employing a
   memory factor (MFFM) to better characterize the directionality of fiber
   propagation. Simulation showed that MFFM yields higher tracking
   accuracy, lower computational load, and better antinoise/crossing
   performance compared with standard FM. Finally, we applied MFFM to
   Alzheimer's disease (AD) DTI data to explore the impaired regional
   connectivity of fiber structure. The results augment the knowledge of
   the pathological alteration of white matter in AD. (c) 2013 Wiley

Abstract = {{We study the stability and robustness of a large platoon of vehicles,
   where each vehicle is modeled as a double integrator, for two
   decentralized control architectures: predecessor following and symmetric
   bidirectional. In the predecessor-following architecture, the control
   action on each agent only depends on the information from its immediate
   front neighbor, whereas in the symmetric bidirectional architecture, it
   depends equally on the information from both its immediate front
   neighbor and back neighbor. We prove asymptotic stability of the
   formation for a class of nonlinear controllers with sector nonlinearity,
   with the linear controller as a special case. We show that the
   convergence rate of the predecessor-following architecture is much
   faster than that of the symmetric bidirectional architecture. However,
   the predecessor-following architecture suffers high algebraic growth of
   initial errors. We also establish scaling laws (with N) of certain H
   norms of the formation that measure its robustness to external
   disturbances for the linear case. It is shown that the robustness
   performance grows geometrically in N for predecessor-following
   architecture but only polynomially in N for symmetric-bidirectional
   architecture. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted to verify
   the predictions for the linear case and empirically estimate the
   corresponding performance metrics for a saturation-type nonlinear
   controller. On the basis of the analytical and numerical results, it is
   seen that the symmetric bidirectional architecture outperforms the
   predecessor-following architecture in all measures of performance.
   Within the predecessor-following architecture, the nonlinear controller
   is seen to perform better in general than the linear one. A number of
   design guidelines are provided on the basis of these conclusions.

Abstract = {{A method is presented whereby the translational velocity of a vortex
   ring can be approximated from the total circulation, impulse, and
   kinetic energy of the vortex system. Assuming a uniform vorticity
   density, these bulk quantities define a unique stable vortex ring
   configuration, and the translational velocity can be inferred from this
   configuration and the system scaling. Here, the accuracy of this
   approximation is presented for vortex rings formed from starting jets,
   and the translational velocity is also characterized as it relates to
   the driving parameters. The translational velocity is well approximated
   for a wide range of experimentally generated vortex rings. It is
   observed that starting jets with a converging radial velocity create
   vortex rings with a significantly higher translational velocity. The
   converging radial velocity was observed to increase translational
   velocity by as much as 30\% over parallel jet flows with identical
   volume flux and nozzle diameter, but the exact increase is specific to
   the nozzle arrangement and driving conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the synthesis and characterization of
   Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x superconducting nanowires. Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x nanowires
   with a T-c = 78.7 K are synthesized using the electrospinning process
   employing sol-gel precursors. A sol-gel methodology is used to obtain a
   homogeneous PVP solution containing Bi, Sr, Ca, and Cu acetates. Mats of
   randomly oriented nanowires and aligned nanowires are also collected.
   After a heat treatment at 850 degrees C in ambient atmosphere using
   heating rates of 100 and 400 degrees C/h, fully crystallized
   Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x nanowires are obtained. The morphology, microstructure,
   and crystal structure of these nanowires are then examined to reveal a
   rectangular morphology having typical wire thickness in the range of
   150-250 nm, and a wire width between 400 and 600 nm. DC magnetization
   studies are conducted to investigate the critical transition temperature
   (T-c) of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x x nanowires and to compare their magnetic
   properties to those of bulk Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x powder. The T-c for the
   commercial powder is observed at 78.6 K, and that of the obtained

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This study concerns an improvement in the solar diffusion driven
   desalination process under dynamic operating conditions for
   decentralized water production. The utilization of a heat exchanger for
   the solar diffusion driven desalination (DDD) process to recuperate the
   latent heat of condensation has been examined. It is found that the
   recuperated latent heat is best used for preheating the air inlet to the
   evaporator. Improvements in the system performance are achieved by
   increasing fresh water production by 30\% for the solar DDD with a 0.75
   effectiveness in the integrated heat exchanger. A theoretical model is
   implemented for analyzing the integrated desalination system, and a
   numerical assessment of the system performance for different operating
   conditions is presented. It is found that the installation of a heat
   exchanger for heat recovery in the air stream prior to entering the
   direct contact condenser increases the water production rate and reduces
   the specific energy consumption. It is concluded that the delayed
   operating mode for the solar DDD with an integrated heat exchanger is
   the best operating mode.}},

Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{36}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Dendritic cells (DCs), key regulators of tolerance and immunity, have
   been found to reside in mechanically active tissues such as the interior
   layers of the arterial wall, which experience cyclic radial wall strain
   due to pulsatile blood flow. Although experimentally difficult to
   determine in vivo, it is reasonable to postulate DCs experience the
   mechanical forces in such mechanically active tissues. However, it is
   currently unknown how DCs respond to cyclic mechanical strain. In order
   to explore the hypothesis that DCs are responsive to mechanical strain,
   DCs were cultured in vitro on pre-adsorbed adhesive proteins (e.g.,
   laminin, collagen, fibrinogen) and 1 Hz cyclic strain was applied for
   various durations and strain magnitudes. It was determined that a strain
   magnitude of 10\% and 24 h duration adversely affected DC viability
   compared to no-strain controls, but culture on certain adhesive
   substrates provided modest protection of viability under this harsh
   strain regime. In contrast, application of 1 h of 1 Hz cyclic 3\% strain
   did not affect DC viability and this strain regime was used for the
   remaining experiments for quantifying DC activation and T-cell priming
   capability. Application of 3\% strain increased expression of
   stimulatory (MHC-II) and costimulatory molecules (CD86, CD40), and this
   effect was generally increased by culture on pre-coated adhesive
   substrates. Interestingly, the cytokine secretion profile of DCs was not
   significantly affected by strain. Lastly, strained DCs demonstrated
   increased stimulation of allogeneic T-cell proliferation, in a manner
   that was independent of the adhesive substrate. These observations
   indicate generation of a DC consistent with what has been described as a
   semi-mature phenotype. This work begins elucidating a potential role for
   DCs in tissue environments exposed to cyclic mechanical forces.

Abstract = {{Stochastic Clustering Auctions (SCAs) constitute a class of cooperative
   auction methods that enable improvement of the global cost of the task
   allocations obtained with fast greedy algorithms. Prior research had
   developed Contracts Sequencing Algorithms (CSAs) that are deterministic
   and enable transfers, swaps, and other types of contracts between team
   members. In contrast to CSAs, SCAs use stochastic transfers or swaps
   between the task clusters assigned to each team member and have
   algorithm parameters that can enable tradeoffs between optimality and
   computational and communication requirements. The first SCA was based on
   a ``Gibbs Sampler{''} and constrained the stochastic cluster
   reallocations to simple single transfers or swaps; it is applicable to
   heterogeneous teams. Subsequently, a more efficient SCA was developed,
   based on the generalized Swendsen-Wang method; it achieves the increased
   efficiency by connecting tasks that appear to be synergistic and then
   stochastically reassigning these connected tasks, hence enabling more
   complex and efficient movements between clusters than the first SCA.
   However, its application was limited to homogeneous teams. The
   contribution of this work is to present an efficient SCA for
   heterogeneous teams; it is based on a modified Swendsen-Wang method. For
   centralized auctioning and homogeneous teams, extensive numerical
   experiments were used to provide a comparison in terms of costs and
   computational and communication requirements of the three SCAs and a
   baseline CSA. It was seen that the new SCA maintains the efficiency of
   the second SCA and can yield similar performance to the baseline CSA in
   far fewer iterations. The same metrics were used to evaluate the
   performance of the new SCA for heterogeneous teams. A distributed
   version of the new SCA was also evaluated in numerical experiments. The
   results show that, as expected, the distributed SCA continually improves
   the global performance with each iteration, but converges to a higher
   cost solution than the centralized SCA. The final discussion outlines a
   systematic procedure to use SCA in various aspects of the application of
   multi-robot cooperative systems.}},

Abstract = {{Considering the reliability and safety requirements of power stations, a
   novel adaptive fuzzy controller is presented to implement non-overshoot
   control in power plants in which the Lyapunov-based adaptive law is
   employed to guarantee the stability of the controller while a modified
   Adaptive Binary Harmony Search (ABHS) algorithm is utilized to search
   the optimal control parameters to improve the dynamic performance. Two
   strategies are analyzed and used with ABHS to guarantee the
   non-overshoot of control. Furthermore, a simple but efficient repair
   operation is developed to deal with the time-varying characteristic of
   the thermal process. Finally, the proposed ABHS-based Adaptive Fuzzy
   Control (ABHSAFC) method is applied to the bed temperature control of
   the Circulating Fluidized Bed Boiler (CFBB). The experimental results
   demonstrate that ABHSAFC can implement the expected non-overshoot
   control efficiently and outperforms the classical Lyapunov-based
   adaptive fuzzy control, ABHS-based fuzzy control and ABHS-based PID
   control. Considering the characteristics of the easy implementation,
   robustness and the guaranteed stability, ABHSAFC promises a favorable
   engineering application prospect. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Selecting important genes from microarray data is a considerably
   challenging problem as shown in Guyon's 2002 paper in this journal. We
   have developed an alternative feature ranking and selection methodology
   to tackle this problem. On the basis of several cancer data sets, AMFES
   (adaptive multiple features selection) outperforms Guyon's RFE
   (recursive feature elimination). In this paper, we will present a
   comprehensive and systematic comparison of three methods: AMFES, RFE,
   and the CORR (correlation coefficient) on five data sets (leukemia,
   colon, lymphoma, prostate, and potentially others). The leukemia, colon,
   and lymphoma data sets are adapted from Guyon's paper for convenience
   and the prostate cancer data set is from a public database, NCBI GEO
   (Gene Expression Omnibus). These three methods are compared in terms of
   test accuracy, number of selected features, computational time (total
   and training), statistical significance (t test, p values, and ROC
   (receiver operating characteristic)/AUC (area under curve)), and the
   discovery rate of informative features. AMFES obtains better results in
   computational time and number of selected features while maintaining
   higher or comparable test accuracy, statistical significance, and the
   discovery rate of informative features. In addition, AMFES can serve as
   a general methodology for other similar problems such as sampling and
   data mining. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Title = {{A scaling analysis of added-mass and history forces and their coupling
   in dispersed multiphase flows}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIPHASE FLOW}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{102-114}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Accurate momentum coupling model is vital to simulation of dispersed
   multiphase flows. The overall force exerted on a particle is divided
   into four physically meaningful contributions, i.e., quasi-steady,
   stress-gradient, added-mass, and viscous-unsteady (history) forces. Time
   scale analysis on the turbulent multiphase flow and the viscous-unsteady
   kernel shows that the integral representation of the viscousunsteady
   force is required except for a narrow range of particle size around the
   Kolmogorov length scale when particle-to-fluid density ratio is large.
   Conventionally, the particle-to-fluid density ratio is used to evaluate
   the relative importance of the unsteady forces (stress-gradient,
   added-mass, and history forces) in the momentum coupling. However, it is
   shown from our analysis that when particle-to-fluid density ratio is
   large, the importance of the unsteady forces depends on the
   particle-to-fluid length scale ratio and not on the density ratio.
   Provided the particle size is comparable to the smallest fluid length
   scale (i.e., Kolmogorov length scale for turbulence or shock thickness
   for shock-particle interaction) or larger, unsteady forces are important
   in evaluating the particle motion. Furthermore, the particle mass
   loading is often used to estimate the importance of the back effect of
   particles on the fluid. An improved estimate of backward coupling for
   each force contribution is established through a scaling argument. The
   back effects of stress-gradient and added-mass forces depend on particle
   volume fraction. For large particle-to-fluid density ratio, the
   importance of the quasi-steady force in backward coupling depends on the
   particle mass fraction; while that of the viscous-unsteady force is
   related to both particle mass and volume fractions. Published by
   Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Inventory pooling is at the root of many celebrated ideas in operations
   management. Postponement, component commonality, and resource
   flexibility are some examples. Motivated by our experience in the
   aftermarket services industry, we propose a model of inventory pooling
   to meet differentiated service levels for multiple customers. Our
   central research question is the following: What are the minimum
   inventory level and optimal allocation policy when a pool of inventory
   is used in a single period to satisfy individual service levels for
   multiple customers? We measure service by the probability of fulfilling
   a customer's entire demand immediately from stock. We characterize the
   optimal solution in several allocation policy classes; provide some
   structural results, formulas, and bounds; and also make detailed
   interpolicy comparisons. We show that the pooling benefit is always
   strictly positive, even when there are an arbitrary number of customers
   with perfectly positively correlated demands.}},

Abstract = {{The drain current fluctuation of ungated AlGaN/GaN high electron
   mobility transistors (HEMTs) measured in different fluids at a
   drain-source voltage of 0.5V was investigated. The HEMTs with metal on
   the gate region showed good current stability in deionized water, while
   a large fluctuation in drain current was observed for HEMTs without gate
   metal. The fluctuation in drain current for the HEMTs without gate metal
   was observed and calculated as standard deviation from a real-time
   measurement in air, deionized water, ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide,
   ethylene glycol, 1,2-butanediol, and glycerol. At room temperature, the
   fluctuation in drain current for the HEMTs without gate metal was found
   to be relevant to the dipole moment and the viscosity of the liquids. A
   liquid with a larger viscosity showed a smaller fluctuation in drain
   current. The viscosity-dependent fluctuation of the drain current was
   ascribed to the Brownian motions of the liquid molecules, which induced
   a variation in the surface dipole of the gate region. This study
   uncovers the causes of the fluctuation in drain current of HEMTs in
   fluids. The results show that the AlGaN/GaN HEMTs may be used as sensors
   to measure the viscosity of liquids within a certain range of viscosity.

Abstract = {{Selective adsorption onto agarose gels has become a powerful method to
   separate single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). A better understanding
   of the nature of the interactive forces and specific sites responsible
   for adsorption should lead to significant improvements in the
   selectivity and yield of these separations. A combination of
   nonequilibrium and equilibrium studies are conducted to explore the
   potential role that van der Waals, ionic, hydrophobic, pi-pi and
   ion-dipole interactions have on the selective adsorption between agarose
   and SWCNTs suspended with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The results
   demonstrate that any modification to the agarose gel surface and,
   consequently, the permanent dipole moments of agarose drastically
   reduces the retention of SWCNTs. Because these permanent dipoles are
   critical to retention and the fact that SDS-SWCNTs function as
   macro-ions, it is proposed that ion dipole forces are the primary
   interaction responsible for adsorption. The selectivity of adsorption
   may be attributed to variations in polarizability between nanotube
   types, which create differences in both the structure and mobility of
   surfactant. These differences affect the enthalpy and entropy of
   adsorption, and both play an integral part in the selectivity of
   adsorption. The overall adsorption process shows a complex behavior that
   is not well represented by the Langmuir model; therefore, calorimetric
   data should be used to extract thermodynamic information.}},

Abstract = {{Barium titanate (BaTiO3) nanowires have gained considerable research
   interest due to their lead-free composition and strong energy conversion
   efficiency. However, most research has focused on free-standing BaTiO3
   nanowires, which are hard to apply for sensing and energy harvesting.
   Here, a novel method for the growth of vertically aligned BaTiO3
   nanowire arrays on a conductive substrate is developed, and their
   electromechanical coupling behavior is directly evaluated to yield the
   strain coupling coefficient. The preparation of vertically aligned
   BaTiO3 nanowire arrays is based on a two-step hydrothermal reaction by
   first growing oriented rutile TiO2 nanowire arrays and then converting
   them to BaTiO3 while simultaneously retaining their morphology. A
   refined piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM) testing method is applied
   to demonstrate the piezoelectric behavior of BaTiO3 nanowires in the
   longitude direction. The piezoelectric response (d(33) = 43 +/- 2 pm/V)
   of the BaTiO3 nanowires is measured to demonstrate their potential
   application in sensors, energy harvesting, and micro-electromechanical
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Multifunctional nanoparticles show great potential in the biomedical
   field and may help the diagnosis and therapy of diseases.
   Superparamagnetic nanoparticles are especially attractive because of
   their ability to dissipate thermal energy in an alternating magnetic
   field. Furthermore, plasmonic nanoparticles can be effectively used in
   non- or minimally invasive therapy of tumors exploiting their plasmonic
   photothermal effect. Here, hybrid plasmonicmagnetic Ag/Fe2O3
   nanoparticles are made by flame aerosol technology. These nanoparticles
   can be in situ encapsulated with an amorphous nanothin SiO2 film to
   facilitate their dispersion and block any toxicity from Ag/Fe2O3.
   Detailed physicochemical characterization, including electron
   microscopy, electron dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray
   diffraction, is performed. Furthermore, their magnetic properties are
   characterized in detail by monitoring their hysteresis,
   first-order-reversal-curves, and isothermal remanent magnetization.
   Finally, the effect of SiO2 and Agcontent on the specific absorption
   rate (SAR) of the hybrid Ag/Fe2O3 nanoparticles is investigated. The
   obtained understanding will help the rational design and engineering of
   multifunctional hybrid nanoprobes targeting specific biomedical
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Isoindigo and derivatives thereof were synthesized and characterized by
   means of differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and UV-vis absorption and
   fluorescence spectroscopies. The experimental results were compared with
   the results of density functional theory (DFT) calculations to provide
   structure property relationships on the basis of the type of substituent
   and attachment position (5,5' vs 6,6') on isoindigo. The integration of
   if-electron donors mainly affects the ionization potential (IP) as the
   isoindigo unit dictates the electron affinity (EA). The incorporation of
   electron withdrawing groups affects the EA through contributions of and
   if-effects that depend on the electron deficiency of the substituent.
   Perspectives on the photostability of isoindigo and its derivatives are
   presented along with a discussion about the relation between
   substitution pattern and the strength of the optical transitions.
   Functionalization of the 5(5') carbon in isoindigo leads to a smaller
   transition dipole moment when compared to substitution on carbon 6(6'),
   while having a small effect on the frontier orbital energies. These
   observations enhance our understanding of the electronic structure and
   optical properties of isoindigo and permit important advances in the
   establishment of unambiguous design parameters for the next generation
   of isoindigo-based oligomers and polymers.}},

   decreased with increasing the AuCl3 concentrations. However, the forward

   graphene transparent conductive electrodes at a forward bias of 8 V were
   increased by similar to 48, 63 and 73\%, respectively, which can be

   solution to mobilize CIP. Though the amount of Fe/Al oxides on native
   sand surface was limited, it significantly impeded CIP transport,
   delaying CIP breakthrough curve from 30 to >100 PV. In clean sand where
   Fe/Al oxides were removed, Ca and Cu significantly promoted CIP
   transport by reducing the retardation factor R from 22 to <2. In native
   sand, due to CIP's strong complexation with Fe/Al, only Cu promoted CIP
   transport. When CIP was pre-sorbed onto sand, neither Cu nor Ca was
   effective in mobilizing CIP from native sand. However, Cu effectively
   mobilized 90\% CIP whereas Ca mobilized 30\% CIP from clean sand. A
   mathematical model based on advection-dispersion equation coupled with
   equilibrium and kinetic reactions successfully simulated CIP transport
   in saturated sand media. Our results suggested that cations in aqueous
   solution and on solid phase are important to better understand CIP
   transport in soils. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Estimating tibiofemoral joint contact forces is important for
   understanding the initiation and progression of knee osteoarthritis.
   However, tibiofemoral contact force predictions are influenced by many
   factors including muscle forces and anatomical representations of the
   knee joint. This study aimed to investigate the influence of
   subject-specific geometry and knee joint kinematics on the prediction of
   tibiofemoral contact forces using a calibrated EMG-driven
   neuromusculoskeletal model of the knee. One participant fitted with an
   instrumented total knee replacement walked at a self-selected speed
   while medial and lateral tibiofemoral contact forces, ground reaction
   forces, whole-body kinematics, and lower-limb muscle activity were
   simultaneously measured. The combination of generic and subject-specific
   knee joint geometry and kinematics resulted in four different OpenSim
   models used to estimate muscle-tendon lengths and moment arms. The
   subject-specific geometric model was created from CT scans and the
   subject-specific knee joint kinematics representing the translation of
   the tibia relative to the femur was obtained from fluoroscopy. The
   EMG-driven model was calibrated using one walking trial, but with three
   different cost functions that tracked the knee flexion/extension moments
   with and without constraint over the estimated joint contact forces. The
   calibrated models then predicted the medial and lateral tibiofemoral
   contact forces for five other different walking trials. The use of
   subject-specific models with minimization of the peak tibiofemoral
   contact forces improved the accuracy of medial contact forces by 47\%
   and lateral contact forces by 7\%, respectively compared with the use of
   generic musculoskeletal model. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes are promising new materials which
   have potential applications in light paraffin/olefin gas separations.
   Despite the importance of mass transport in these materials there have
   been no reported diffusion studies of C-2 (or larger) hydrocarbons in
   CMS membranes using microscopic techniques. In this work, a pulsed field
   gradient (PFG) NMR technique employing high magnetic field and large
   magnetic field gradients enabled the measurement of microscopic
   self-diffusion of ethane and ethylene in selected CMS membranes. For the
   studied Matrimid CMS membranes, the results of PFG NMR diffusion studies
   are compared with corresponding data obtained from macroscopic
   permeation measurements reported in the literature. It was found that
   although the ratios of ethane and ethylene diffusivities measured by
   these two techniques were the same within the experimental uncertainty,
   the diffusivities obtained by PFG NMR were several times larger than
   those obtained from permeation. The reasons for such difference are
   discussed. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the control of cyclotrimerization forming a polycyanurate
   polymer using magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in an
   alternating-current (ac) field as an internal heat source, starting from
   a commercially available monomer. Magnetic nanoparticles were dispersed
   in the monomer and catalytic system using sonication, and the mixture
   was subjected to an alternating magnetic field, causing the magnetic
   nanoparticles to dissipate the energy of the magnetic field in the form
   of heat. Internal heating of the particle/monomer/catalyst system was
   sufficient to start and sustain the polymerization reaction, producing a
   cyanate ester network with conversion that compared favorably to
   polymerization through heating in a conventional laboratory oven. The
   two heating methods gave similar differential scanning calorimetry
   temperature profiles, conversion rates, and glass transition
   temperatures when using the same temperature profile. The ability of
   magnetic nanoparticles in an ac field to drive the curing reaction
   should allow for other reactions forming high-temperature thermosetting
   polymers and for innovative ways to process such polymers.}},

Title = {{Influence of Neuropathology on Convection-Enhanced Delivery in the Rat
   Hippocampus}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 8}},
Abstract = {{Local drug delivery techniques, such as convention-enhanced delivery
   (CED), are promising novel strategies for delivering therapeutic agents
   otherwise limited by systemic toxicity and blood-brain-barrier
   restrictions. CED uses positive pressure to deliver infusate
   homogeneously into interstitial space, but its distribution is dependent
   upon appropriate tissue targeting and underlying neuroarchitecture. To
   investigate effects of local tissue pathology and associated edema on
   infusate distribution, CED was applied to the hippocampi of rats that
   underwent electrically-induced, self-sustaining status epilepticus (SE),
   a prolonged seizure. Infusion occurred 24 hours post-SE, using a
   macromolecular tracer, the magnetic resonance (MR) contrast agent
   gadolinium chelated with diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid and
   covalently attached to albumin (Gd-albumin). High-resolution T1- and
   T2-relaxation-weighted MR images were acquired at 11.1 Tesla in vivo
   prior to infusion to generate baseline contrast enhancement images and
   visualize morphological changes, respectively. T1-weighted imaging was
   repeated post-infusion to visualize final contrast-agent distribution
   profiles. Histological analysis was performed following imaging to
   characterize injury. Infusions of Gd-albumin into injured hippocampi
   resulted in larger distribution volumes that correlated with increased
   injury severity, as measured by hyperintense regions seen in T2-weighted
   images and corresponding histological assessments of neuronal
   degeneration, myelin degradation, astrocytosis, and microglial
   activation. Edematous regions included the CA3 hippocampal subfield,
   ventral subiculum, piriform and entorhinal cortex, amygdalar nuclei,
   middle and laterodorsal/lateroposterior thalamic nuclei. This study
   demonstrates MR-visualized injury processes are reflective of cellular
   alterations that influence local distribution volume, and provides a
   quantitative basis for the planning of local therapeutic delivery
   strategies in pathological brain regions.}},

   surface roughness and dewetting}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{44}},
Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{We present experimental data for the static or breakloose friction for
   lubricated elastomer contacts, as a function of the time of stationary
   contact. Due to fluid squeeze-out from the asperity contact regions, the
   breakloose friction force increases continuously with the time of
   stationary contact. We consider three different cases: (a) PDMS rubber
   balls against flat smooth glass surfaces, (b) PDMS cylinder ribs against
   different substrates (glass, smooth and rough PMMA and an inert polymer)
   and (c) application to syringes. Due to differences in the surface
   roughness and contact pressures the three systems exhibit very different
   time dependences of the breakloose friction. In case (a) for rough
   surfaces the dry contact area A is a small fraction of the nominal
   contact area A(0), and the fluid squeeze-out is fast. In case (b) the
   dry contact area is close to the nominal contact area, A/A(0)
   approximate to 1, and fluid squeeze-out is very slow due to percolation
   of the contact area. In this case, remarkably, different fluids with
   very different viscosities, ranging from 0.005 Pa s (water-glycerol
   mixture) to 1.48 Pa s (glycerol), give very similar breakloose friction
   forces as a function of the time of stationary contact. In case (c) the
   contact pressure and the surface roughness are larger than in case (b),
   and the squeeze-out is very slow so that even after a very long time the
   area of real contact is below the percolation threshold. For all cases
   (a)-(c), the increase in the breakloose friction is mainly due to the
   increase in the area of real contact with increasing time, because of
   the fluid squeeze-out and dewetting.}},

Abstract = {{Laminated paper-based analytical devices (LPAD) with origami-enabled
   chemiluminescence immunoassay have been developed for the detection of
   cotinine, a secondhand smoke (SHS) biomarker. The devices were
   fabricated by a craft-cutter to define flow channels, followed by
   lamination. This approach of cutting/lamination to fabricate LPAD is
   very similar to making an identification card, offering advantages in
   simplicity and rugged backing when compared to the common method of
   patterning paper using SU-8 or wax. We also developed a protocol of
   localized incision and paper-folding to isolate the detection zone from
   flow channels; the simple origami step eliminated possible reagent
   diffusion and flow during antibody immobilization steps and numerous
   washings. By incorporating luminol-based chemiluminescence for detecting
   horseradish peroxidase-conjugated cotinine, we employed origami-enabled
   LPAD to detect cotinine in mouse serum using competitive immunoassay.
   The detection limit was determined to be 5 ng/mL, a clinically relevant
   concentration. We believe that LPAD with chemiluminescence detection
   provides a new platform of low cost and sensitive assays for cotinine
   detection.}},

Abstract = {{The emissions of polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins, dibenzofurans
   (PBDD/Fs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) from trial
   combustion of 10 wt \% dried industrial-wastewater-treatment sludge
   (IWTS) and 90 wt \% woodchip in an industrial boiler were investigated
   and compared to that from woodchip combustion. The PBDD/F toxic
   equivalent (TEQ) and PBDE emissions increased from 0.121 pg TEQ Nm(-3)
   and 2260 pg Nm(-3), respectively, of the woodchip combustion to 0.211 pg
   TEQ Nm(-3) and 4200 pg Nm(-3), respectively, of the trial combustion.
   PBDD/F and PBDE congener profiles of inputs and outputs of the same type
   of combustion were similar; they also show similarity between woodchip
   and trial combustions, revealing that the destruction pathway was little
   affected by the introduction of the IWTS. The fates of PBDD/Fs and PBDEs
   show that the indigenous pollutants in the feed were effectively
   depleted (>93.5\%). The dominant releasing route of PBDD/F and PBDE
   shifted from the stack flue gas of woodchip combustion to the ashes of
   trial combustion. This study demonstrates that co-combustion not only
   handles the fast growing sludge stream but also yields a saving of
   26.3\% in the fuel cost and treatment fees of sludge and ashes.}},

Abstract = {{Mesoscale (nanometers to microns) magnetic particles are becoming
   increasingly important in biomedical applications both in vitro for cell
   and tissue-based research and in vivo for clinical imaging and therapy.
   These applications generally rely on the fact that, while the body is
   relatively transparent to magnetic fields, magnetic particles within the
   body, or in ex vivo biological samples, will couple strongly to applied
   external fields. By synthesizing bio-functionalized, biocompatible
   polymer/magnetic particle composites, this remote coupling provides a
   mechanism for the precisely targeted actuation of cell signaling
   pathways, delivery of genes, targeted transmission of thermal energy,
   generation of tissue matrix, and imaging (via magnetic resonance
   imaging), among others. This article explores a variety of biomedical
   applications of mesoscale magnetic particles, some of which are
   routinely used in the clinic and in biomedical laboratories, with others
   approaching the realm of science fiction.}},

Abstract = {{Copper fungicides are commonly used for protective applications against
   foliar fungal and bacterial diseases in citrus groves. Management of
   these products must be finely balanced between disease prevention,
   application costs, fruit blemishes caused by copper phytotoxicity, and
   toxic accumulation of copper in the soil. The traditional schedule for
   copper sprays in Florida is an every 21-day post-bloom application.
   However, our computer simulation analysis showed that this traditional
   schedule is inefficient and leaves the grove unprotected in wet years
   and applies unnecessary copper sprays in dry years. In order to
   facilitate the copper management for the citrus growers, a user friendly
   internet-based decision support system was developed. This system is
   capable of estimating the copper residue on the fruit based on rainfall
   records and spray details. This allows producers to plan the copper
   applications in order to minimize unprotected periods while avoiding
   unnecessary applications in dry years.}},

Abstract = {{Cystinosis is an inherited genetic disease characterized by the
   accumulation of cystine crystals in several tissues including the
   cornea. The corneal manifestations of cystinosis are treated by hourly
   instillation of cysteamine eye drops each day while awake. The high
   frequency of eye drop instillation along with the long duration of
   treatment leads to poor compliance in many patients. We have combined in
   vitro experiments with mathematical modeling to investigate the
   feasibility of daily use of cysteamine loaded contact lenses to replace
   the hourly instillation of drops. Our approach was based on
   incorporation of vitamin E diffusion barriers into commercially
   available contact lenses to increase the duration of drug release.
   Contact lenses were first soaked in a solution of vitamin E in ethanol.
   Subsequently, the lenses were soaked in an aqueous solution of
   cysteamine to load the drug. The drug release profiles from vitamin E
   treated lenses were measured under sink conditions. In addition, drug
   oxidation rates were measured after exposing drug loaded contact lenses
   to humidified room air. To study further the feasibility of using
   contact lenses for the delivery of cysteamine, a mass transfer model was
   used to determine the rates at which the drug loaded in the lens is
   delivered to the cornea. The results show that vitamin E loading
   increases the release duration from 10 min to about 3 h in solution,
   thus allowing the possibility of extended drug delivery. In addition to
   improving the release profiles, vitamin E loading also improved the drug
   stability by reducing the oxidation rates. The mathematical modeling of
   drug transport in the eye suggested that the vitamin E loaded contact
   lens can provide the daily therapeutic dose without causing toxicity,
   while significantly increasing the bioavailability compared to eye
   drops. Based on the in vitro experimental results and the mathematical
   modeling, it is likely that a single contact lens worn for about 2 h
   could achieve the same therapeutic effects as hourly instillation of eye
   drops. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines a procurement planning scenario in which a firm
   wishes to obtain some quantity of a good from a set of capacitated
   suppliers whose products are interchangeable. The total cost to acquire
   the good from a supplier is a nondecreasing concave function of the
   amount of the product purchased, as a result of economies of scale
   and/or bulk discounts offered by the supplier. The problem of minimising
   the total cost incurred in obtaining the required amount of the good is
   NP-hard in itself, but further complicating the situation is the
   existence of a competing firm (or set of firms) with its own demand for
   the same input or good. The existence of such competition leads to a
   situation in which the first firm (the leader') must consider the
   actions of their competitor(s) (whom we model as a single follower')
   when minimising procurement cost, because the follower's procurement
   amounts decrease the suppliers' available capacity levels. To mitigate
   the effects of the follower's actions, the leader can protect' any
   supplier at some cost (e.g. by signing a contract in which the supplier
   guarantees some level of capacity). Therefore, our problem is a
   three-stage game in which the leader first chooses which suppliers to
   protect, the follower satisfies its demand, and the leader satisfies its
   demand from the remaining capacity. We model this problem as a
   three-stage mixed-integer programme, and propose algorithms for its
   optimal solution via reformulation and cutting-plane techniques.}},

   different device parameters such as the internal electric field, the
   film morphology, and the carrier recombination rate which are important
   to the device performance. Here, we will present the material properties
   and requirements for these interlayers used in high efficiency OPV

Abstract = {{This study examines the influence of Silicon Carbide (SiC) particle
   addition on thermal conductivity of UO2-SiC composite pellets. UO2
   powder and beta-sic particles of different sizes and of different volume
   fractions were mechanically mixed and sintered at 1350-1450 degrees C
   for 5 min by Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS). The particle size (0.6-55 mu
   m diameter) and volume fraction (5-20\%) of SiC were systematically
   varied to investigate their influence on the resulting UO2-SiC composite
   pellet microstructure and the thermal properties. It was found that SiC
   particle size less than 16.9 mu m with larger volume fraction is more
   effective for improving the thermal conductivity of the fuel pellets.
   Scanning Electron Microscopy examination revealed micro-cracking and
   interfacial debonding in the composites containing larger size SiC
   particles (16.9 and 55 pm) which resulted in reduced thermal
   conductivity. For the UO2-SiC composite pellets containing I gm diameter
   SiC particles, the thermal conductivity increased almost linearly with
   volume fraction of particles. However, the addition of a larger volume
   fraction of SiC reduces the amount of heavy metal in the composite
   pellet and therefore a higher U-235 enrichment is necessary to
   compensate for the heavy metal loss. The experimental thermal
   conductivity values of the UO2-SiC composite pellets are in good
   agreement with the theoretical values based on the available model in
   the literature. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we describe an application of prescriptive analytics to
   enhance data-driven decision making at a specialty steel bar products
   supplier and manufacturer in North America. As part of the company's
   daily business, it must make available-to-promise (ATP) decisions, which
   determine in real time the dates by which it can promise delivery of
   products that customers requested during the quotation stage.
   Previously, a salesperson had to make such decisions by analyzing
   reports on available inventory. To support these ATP decisions, we
   developed a real-time decision support system (DSS) to find an optimal
   assignment of the available inventory and to support additional what-if
   analysis. The DSS uses a suite of mixed-integer programming models and
   commercial software to solve the models. The company has incorporated
   the DSS into its enterprise resource planning system to seamlessly
   facilitate its use of business analytics.}},

Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{47-65}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper analyzes and designs tradable credit schemes on networks with
   two types of players, namely, a finite number of Cournot-Nash (CN)
   players and an infinite number of (infinitesimal) Wardrop-equilibrium
   (WE) players. We first show that there are nonnegative anonymous credit
   schemes that yield system optimum, when transaction costs are not
   considered. We then analyze how transaction costs would affect the
   trading and route-choice behaviors of both CN and WE players, and
   discuss the equilibrium conditions on the coupled credit market and
   transportation network in the presence of transaction costs. A
   variational inequality is formulated to describe the equilibrium and is
   subsequently applied to a numerical example to assess the impacts of
   transaction costs on a tradable credit system. As expected, transaction
   costs reduce the trading volume of credits and change their market
   price. They also change the way how players respond to credit charges in
   their route choices and cause efficiency losses to the credit schemes
   that are previously designed without considering transaction costs. With
   transaction costs, travel costs of WE players will likely increase while
   those of CN players may decrease due to their higher adaptability in
   routing strategies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{One of the major sources of pharmaceuticals in the environment is
   wastewater effluent of which human urine contributes the majority of
   pharmaceuticals. Urine source separation has the potential to isolate
   pharmaceuticals at a higher concentration for efficient removal as well
   as produce a nutrient byproduct. This research investigated the efficacy
   of using strong-base anion exchange polymer resins to remove the widely
   detected and abundant pharmaceutical, diclofenac, from synthetic human
   urine under fresh and ureolyzed conditions. The majority of experiments
   were conducted using a strong-base, macroporous, polystyrene resin
   (Purolite A520E). Ion-exchange followed a two-step removal rate with
   rapid removal in 1 h and equilibrium removal in 24 h. Diclofenac removal
   was >90\% at a resin dose of 8 mL/L in both fresh and ureolyzed urine.
   Sorption of diclofenac onto A520E resin was concurrent with desorption
   of an equivalent amount of chloride, which indicates the ion-exchange
   mechanism is occurring. The presence of competing ions such as phosphate
   and citrate did not significantly impact diclofenac removal. Comparisons
   of three polystyrene resins (A520E, Dowex 22, Dowex Marathon 11) as well
   as one polyacrylic resin (IRA958) were conducted to determine the major
   interactions between anion exchange resin and diclofenac. The results
   showed that polystyrene resins provide the highest level of diclofenac
   removal due to electrostatic interactions between quaternary ammonium
   functional groups of resin and carboxylic acid of diclofenac and
   non-electrostatic interactions between resin matrix and benzene rings of
   diclofenac. Diclofenac was effectively desorbed from A520E resin using a
   regeneration solution that contained 4.5\% (m/m) NaCl in an equal-volume
   mixture of methanol and water. The greater regeneration efficiency of
   the NaCl/methanol-water mixture over the aqueous NaCl solution supports
   the importance of non-electrostatic interactions between resin matrix
   and benzene rings of diclofenac. Experiments with ketoprofen, in
   addition to diclofenac, suggest that polystyrene anion exchange resins
   can be used to selectively remove other acidic pharmaceuticals from
   urine. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Abstract = {{A configuration that shows great promise in sensing applications is
   vertically aligned piezoelectric nanowire arrays that allow facile
   interfacing with electrical interconnects. Nano-electromechanical
   systems developed using piezoelectric nanowires have gained interest
   primarily for their potential in energy harvesting applications, because
   they are able to convert several different sources of mechanical energy
   into useful electrical power. To date, no results have demonstrated the
   capability to use aligned piezoelectric nanowire arrays as a highly
   accurate nano-electromechanical system based dynamic sensor with a wide
   operating bandwidth and unity coherence. Here we report the growth of
   vertically aligned (similar to 45 mu m long) barium titanate nanowire
   arrays, realized through a two-step hydrothermal synthesis approach, and
   demonstrate their use as an accurate accelerometer. High sensitivity of
   up to 50 mV g(-1) is observed from the sensor composed of vertically
   aligned barium titanate nanowire arrays, thus providing performance
   comparable to many of the commercial accelerometer systems.}},

   particular, C2H, CH3, and C3H5 are deposited on an amorphous poly
   (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) substrate with kinetic energies of 4, 10,
   25, and 50 eV and compared to the deposition of H at the same energies.
   The short-range forces on the atoms are determined using the second
   generation reactive empirical many-body potential, while the long-range
   forces are determined using a Lennard-Jones potential. The simulations
   predict that at all these incident energies, the chemical modification
   of the PMMA is limited to within a nanometer of the surface. Atoms,
   fragments, and incident polyatomics are further predicted to chemically
   attach to specific sites on the PMMA monomers at low energies and to
   attach to a wider range of sites at higher energies. However, no
   appreciable cross-linking between polymer chains is predicted to occur.
   Variation in the penetration depth of the deposited polyatomics or H is
   correlated to differences in their size and bond saturation. The
   greatest extent of chemical modification of the PMMA surface slab is
   achieved for C2H deposition with 50 eV of kinetic energy. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Magnetomicelles are amphiphilic block copolymer micelles, which contain
   magnetic nanoparticles in the core. Magnetomicelles have been proposed
   as magnetic fluid hyperthermia agents for cancer treatment. Magnetic
   interactions between nanoparticles within a micelle affect the amount of
   heat that they dissipate. Here, magnetomicelles are prepared varying the
   molecular weight of the core-forming polymer block. The magnetomicelles
   are magnetically characterized in liquid suspensions and embedded in a
   polymer matrix. The results show that as the molecular weight of the
   core-forming polymer block increases, both the interparticle magnetic
   interactions and specific absorption rate decrease. This is probably due
   to mixing between the polymer and the magnetic nanoparticles, which
   increases the interparticle distance.}},

Abstract = {{Diffusion tensor imaging could be useful in characterizing movement
   disorders because it noninvasively examines multiple brain regions
   simultaneously. We report a multitarget imaging approach focused on the
   basal ganglia and cerebellum in Parkinson's disease, parkinsonian
   variant of multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, and
   essential tremor and in healthy controls. Seventy-two subjects were
   studied with a diffusion tensor imaging protocol at 3 Tesla. Receiver
   operating characteristic analysis was performed to directly compare
   groups. Sensitivity and specificity values were quantified for control
   versus movement disorder (92\% sensitivity, 88\% specificity), control
   versus parkinsonism (93\% sensitivity, 91\% specificity), Parkinson's
   disease versus atypical parkinsonism (90\% sensitivity, 100\%
   specificity), Parkinson's disease versus multiple system atrophy (94\%
   sensitivity, 100\% specificity), Parkinson's disease versus progressive
   supranuclear palsy (87\% sensitivity, 100\% specificity), multiple
   system atrophy versus progressive supranuclear palsy (90\% sensitivity,
   100\% specificity), and Parkinson's disease versus essential tremor
   (92\% sensitivity, 87\% specificity). The brain targets varied for each
   comparison, but the substantia nigra, putamen, caudate, and middle
   cerebellar peduncle were the most frequently selected brain regions
   across classifications. These results indicate that using diffusion
   tensor imaging of the basal ganglia and cerebellum accurately classifies
   subjects diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, atypical parkinsonism, and
   essential tremor and clearly distinguishes them from control subjects.

Abstract = {{Small-holder farmers in Ethiopia are facing several climate related
   hazards, in particular highly variable rainfall with severe droughts
   which can have devastating effects on their livelihoods. Projected
   changes in climate are expected to aggravate the existing challenges.
   This study examines farmer perceptions on current climate variability
   and long-term changes, current adaptive strategies, and potential
   barriers for successful further adaptation in two case study regions-the
   Central Rift Valley (CRV) and Kobo Valley. The study was based on a
   household questionnaire, interviews with key stakeholders, and focus
   group discussions. The result revealed that about 99 \% of the
   respondents at the CRV and 96 \% at the Kobo Valley perceived an
   increase in temperature and 94 \% at CRV and 91 \% at the Kobo Valley
   perceived a decrease in rainfall over the last 20-30 years. Inter-annual
   and intraseasonal rainfall variability also has increased according to
   the farmers. The observed climate data (1977-2009) also showed an
   increasing trend in temperature and high inter-annual and intra-seasonal
   rainfall variability. In contrast to farmers' perceptions of a decrease
   in rainfall totals, observed rainfall data showed no statistically
   significant decline. The interaction among various bio-physical and
   socio-economic factors, changes in rainfall intensity and reduced water
   available to crops due to increased hot spells, may have influenced the
   perception of farmers with respect to rainfall trends. In recent
   decades, farmers in both the CRV and Kobo have changed farming practices
   to adapt to perceived climate change and variability, for example,
   through crop and variety choice, adjustment of cropping calendar, and in
   situ moisture conservation. These relatively low-cost changes in farm
   practices were within the limited adaptation capacity of farmers, which
   may be insufficient to deal with the impacts of future climate change.
   Anticipated climate change is expected to impose new risks outside the
   range of current experiences. To enable farmers to adapt to these
   impacts critical technological, institutional, and market-access
   constraints need to be removed. Inconsistencies between farmers'
   perceptions and observed climate trends (e.g., decrease in annual
   rainfall) could lead to sub-optimal or counterproductive adaptations,
   and therefore must be removed by better communication and capacity
   building, for example through Climate Field Schools. Enabling
   strategies, which are among others targeted at agricultural inputs,
   credit supply, market access, and strengthening of local knowledge and
   information services need to become integral part of government policies
   to assist farmers to adapt to the impacts of current and future climate
   change.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores scenarios in which independent wind power producers
   form willing coalitions to exploit the reduction in aggregate power
   output variability obtainable through geographic diversity. In the
   setting of a two settlement electricity market, we examine the advantage
   gained through optimal coalitional contract offering strategies for
   quantity risk reduction. We show that a group of independent wind power
   producers can always improve their expected profit by cooperatively
   offering their aggregated power. Using coalitional game theory we
   identify sharing mechanisms to fairly allocate the profits to coalition
   members. We show that the resulting coalitional game is balanced,
   guaranteeing that the core of the game is necessarily nonempty. In

Abstract = {{This paper describes the shaped-beam synthesis of phased arrays using
   the cross entropy (CE) method. The CE method is a general stochastic
   optimization technique based on minimizing the CE (or Kullback-Leibler
   divergence) between sets of probability distributions to solve complex
   multi-extremal, multi-objective optimization problems. In this work, the
   CE method will be utilized to choose the complex weights of array
   element excitations to control the shape of far-field radiation pattern
   side lobe power, main lobe beamwidth, and introduce side lobe notches
   using amplitude-only and complex weight synthesis. Compared with similar
   stochastic techniques previously used to solve this problem, such as the
   genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization, the CE method is a
   competitive alternative, possessing attractive convergence properties.

Abstract = {{In this work it is shown that the exact plastic potential for porous

   to be the most intense natural producers of HF-VHF (3-300 MHz) radiation
   on Earth are reviewed. The M-component mode of charge transfer to ground
   and its difference from the leader/return-stroke mode are discussed.
   Lightning interaction with the ionosphere and the production of

Abstract = {{We consider an optimization problem that integrates network design and
   broadcast domination decisions. Given an undirected graph, a feasible
   broadcast domination is a set of nonnegative integer powers f (i)
   assigned to each node i, such that for any node j in the graph, there
   exists some node k having a positive f (k) -value whose shortest
   distance to node j is no more than f (k) . The cost of a broadcast
   domination solution is the sum of all node power values. The network
   design problem constructs edges that decrease the minimum broadcast
   domination cost on the graph. The overall problem we consider minimizes
   the sum of edge construction costs and broadcast domination costs. We
   show that this problem is NP-hard in the strong sense, even on
   unweighted graphs. We then propose a decomposition strategy, which
   iteratively adds valid inequalities based on optimal broadcast
   domination solutions corresponding to the first-stage network design
   solutions. We demonstrate that our decomposition approach is
   computationally far superior to the solution of a single large-scale
   mixed-integer programming formulation.}},

Abstract = {{The unit commitment problem has been a very important problem in the
   power system operations, because it is aimed at reducing the power
   production cost by optimally scheduling the commitments of generation
   units. Meanwhile, it is a challenging problem because it involves a
   large amount of integer variables. With the increasing penetration of
   renewable energy sources in power systems, power system operations and
   control have been more affected by uncertainties than before. This paper
   discusses a stochastic unit commitment model which takes into account
   various uncertainties affecting thermal energy demand and two types of
   power generators, i.e., quick-start and non-quick-start generators. This
   problem is a stochastic mixed integer program with discrete decision
   variables in both first and second stages. In order to solve this
   difficult problem, a method based on Benders decomposition is applied.
   Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm can solve the
   stochastic unit commitment problem efficiently, especially those with
   large numbers of scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR employing a high magnetic field of 17.6T
   was used to study self-diffusion of carbon dioxide in alumina stabilized
   samaria aerogel, a promising porous catalyst for gas-phase reactions.
   Such rare-earth aerogels exhibit high porosity and surface area with
   active sites directly integrated into the pore framework. In the
   reported diffusion NMR studies, application of a high magnetic field was
   essential for obtaining sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratios under
   conditions of relatively low CO2 densities in the primarily mesoporous
   catalyst particles. The diffusion studies were performed with the
   catalyst that was formed into the following two types of samples:
   macroscopic monoliths and beds of particles with sizes around 200m. The
   sorbate diffusivity inside the monolith was compared with the
   corresponding diffusivity in the bed under conditions of fast exchange
   of CO2 between the particles and the interparticle voids of the bed. The
   two-domain exchange model proposed by Karger for zeolites was used to
   describe the latter diffusivity. The reported results are expected to be
   useful for elucidating an influence of possible transport limitations
   under reaction conditions in aerogel catalysts.}},

Abstract = {{Acyclic diene metathesis polymerization (ADMET) has taken a long path
   from its beginnings with Schrock catalyst and un-functionalized dienes
   to use of Grubbs catalysts with nearly unlimited choices for pendant
   groups and chain composition. This review covers synthesis of model
   linear polyethylene via ADMET polymerization, synthesis of polymers from
   green feed stocks, and the effect of spacer length on morphology and
   polymer properties. By taking advantage of ADMET's functional group
   tolerance, it can be used in conjunction with a variety of other organic
   transformations and in-chain functional groups to yield unique
   architectures and properties. These topics will demonstrate the utility
   of ADMET in the future of polymer science.}},

Abstract = {{Heterostructures based on layering of two-dimensional (2D) materials
   such as graphene and hexagonal boron nitride represent a new class of
   electronic devices. Realizing this potential, however, depends
   critically on the ability to make high-quality electrical contact. Here,
   we report a contact geometry in which we metalize only the 1D edge of a
   2D graphene layer. In addition to outperforming conventional surface
   contacts, the edge-contact geometry allows a complete separation of the
   layer assembly and contact metallization processes. In graphene
   heterostructures, this enables high electronic performance, including
   low-temperature ballistic transport over distances longer than 15
   micrometers, and room-temperature mobility comparable to the theoretical
   phonon-scattering limit. The edge-contact geometry provides new design
   possibilities for multilayered structures of complimentary 2D materials.}},

Title = {{Surface diffusion on SrTiO3 (100): A temperature accelerated dynamics
   and first principles study}},
Journal = {{SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{617}},
Pages = {{237-241}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Temperature accelerated dynamics (TAD) with an empirical potential is
   used to predict diffusion mechanisms and energy barriers associated with
   surface diffusion of adatoms and surface vacancies on (100) SrTiO3
   (STO). Specifically, Sr, O, and Ti adatoms and vacancies are
   investigated on each termination - Sr and TiO2 - of the SrTiO3 surface.
   We find that the empirical potential predicts different surface mobility
   of adatoms depending on the surface termination: they are mobile with
   relatively low diffusion barriers on the SrO-terminated surface, whereas
   they are largely immobile on the TiO2-terminated surface. One important
   finding is that, of the two binding sites on the SrO-terminated surface,
   one is typically very close in energy to the saddle point. Thus, one of
   the two sites is a good estimator of the migration energy of the adatom,
   a conclusion supported by select density functional theory (DFT)
   calculations. Motivated by this result, we calculate the migration
   energies for a number of metal elements on the SrO-terminated surface:
   Ti, Ba, La, and Al. The DFT results also reveal that the details of the
   migration mechanism depend on the charge state of the diffusing species
   and that the ability of the empirical potential to properly estimate the
   migration mechanism depends on the magnitude and variability of the
   charge transfer between the adatom and the surface. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {{Inhibition of methane adsorption on PdO(101) by water and molecular
   oxygen}},
Journal = {{SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{617}},
Pages = {{249-255}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We used temperature programmed desorption (TPD) to investigate the
   influence of molecular O-2 and H2O on the adsorption of CH4 on the
   PdO(101) surface. We find that a strongly-bound state of molecularly
   adsorbed O-2 suppresses methane adsorption on PdO(101), whereas methane
   readily displaces a more weakly-bound form of molecular O-2 during
   adsorption on PdO(101). Pre-adsorbing O-2 in the strongly-bound state
   limits the subsequent adsorption of methane to only 10\% of the
   saturation coverage in a pure CH4 layer on PdO(101) obtained at 85 K. In
   contrast adsorbing O-2 onto a CH4-saturated layer lowers the methane
   coverage to 49\% of its saturation value, demonstrating that
   oxygen-induced displacement of methane from PdO(101) is only moderately
   effective at 85 K. Water adsorbed on the coordinatively unsaturated
   (cus) Pd sites is more effective than O-2 at both hindering methane
   adsorption and displacing adsorbed methane from PdO(101). We find that
   chemisorbed water limits the adsorption of methane on PdO(101) to a
   coverage as low as similar to 3\% of the saturation coverage of a pure
   CH4 layer on the PdO(101) surface. We also show that pre-adsorbed water
   on the cus-Pd sites completely suppresses the formation and dissociation
   of n-butane sigma-complexes on PdO(101). These results demonstrate that
   methane preferentially binds on the cus-Pd sites of PdO(101) at 85 K,
   and suggest that occupation of the cus-Pd sites by H2O or O-2 is likely
   to inhibit methane activation on PdO(101) under conditions relevant to
   commercial applications of Pd-catalyzed combustion of natural gas. (C)

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Channelrhodopsins-2 (ChR2) are a class of light sensitive proteins that
   offer the ability to use light stimulation to regulate neural activity
   with millisecond precision. In order to address the limitations in the
   efficacy of the wild-type ChR2 (ChRwt) to achieve this objective, new
   variants of ChR2 that exhibit fast mon-exponential photocurrent decay
   characteristics have been recently developed and validated. In this
   paper, we investigate whether the framework of transition rate model
   with 4 states, primarily developed to mimic the biexponential
   photocurrent decay kinetics of ChRwt, as opposed to the low complexity 3
   state model, is warranted to mimic the mono-exponential photocurrent
   decay kinetics of the newly developed fast ChR2 variants: ChETA
   (Gunaydin et al., Nature Neurosci. 13:387-392, 2010) and ChRET/TC
   (Berndt et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 108:7595-7600, 2011). We begin by
   estimating the parameters of the 3-state and 4-state models from
   experimental data on the photocurrent kinetics of ChRwt, ChETA, and
   ChRET/TC. We then incorporate these models into a fast-spiking
   interneuron model (Wang and Buzsaki, J. Neurosci. 16:6402-6413, 1996)
   and a hippocampal pyramidal cell model (Golomb et al., J. Neurophysiol.
   96:1912-1926, 2006) and investigate the extent to which the
   experimentally observed neural response to various optostimulation
   protocols can be captured by these models. We demonstrate that for all
   ChR2 variants investigated, the 4 state model implementation is better
   able to capture neural response consistent with experiments across wide
   range of optostimulation protocol. We conclude by analytically
   investigating the conditions under which the characteristic specific to
   the 3-state model, namely the monoexponential photocurrent decay of the
   newly developed variants of ChR2, can occur in the framework of the
   4-state model.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Most ophthalmic drugs are delivered through eye drops even
   though only about 1 - 5\% of the drug reaches the target tissue and the
   patient compliance is not good. Drug-eluting contact lenses could
   significantly increase bioavailability, reduce side effects and improve
   patient compliance.
   Areas covered: Recent research on drug-eluting contact lenses has
   focused on increasing the release duration through molecular imprinting,
   dispersion of barriers or nanoparticles, increasing drug binding to the
   polymer, sandwiching a PLGA (poly{[}lactic-co-glycolic acid]) layer in a
   lens and developing novel materials. This review covers all these
   studies with a specific focus on the transport mechanisms and advantages
   and disadvantages of each approach.
   Expert opinion: The main reason for prior failures was the short
   duration of release from the lenses. The new technologies can provide
   extended drug release for hours to days. The in vivo animal and clinical
   studies have proven the safety and efficacy of drug-eluting contact
   lenses, while showing considerable improvements compared to eye drops.
   The future appears to be promising but several challenges remain such as
   processing and storage issues, regulatory hurdles, high costs of
   clinical studies, potential lack of acceptance by the elderly, etc.}},

Abstract = {{Hg-0 oxidation by chlorine over CeO2-TiO2 (CeTi) catalysts with
   different CeO2/TiO2 ratios was investigated both in the absence and the
   presence of SO2. Experimental data were analyzed using a kinetic model
   incorporating mass transfer, adsorption equilibrium and mass balance
   with key variables of interest being residence time, catalyst type and
   HCl concentration in simulated coal combustion flue gas. The
   experimental data fitted the proposed kinetic model very well,
   indicating the validity of the model for describing the mechanism of
   Hg-0 oxidation by chlorine over CeTi catalysts. Important kinetic
   parameters, i. e. the overall reaction rate constant and the Langmuir
   adsorption constant, were obtained by fitting the model with
   experimental data. Without SO2, pure CeO2 exhibited the best performance
   in catalyzing Hg-0 oxidation by chlorine, which had a high reaction rate
   constant k of 130 +/- 16.3 s (1). An addition of SO2 did not inhibit the
   adsorption of HCl on pure CeO2; however, it inhibited reactions between
   Hg-0 and chlorine species over pure CeO2, hence resulting in a decrease
   of Hg-0 oxidation efficiency. Combining CeO2 with TiO2 enhanced its
   resistance to SO2. Ce1.5Ti exhibited excellent resistance to SO2. Both
   the overall reaction rate constant and the Langmuir adsorption constant
   maintained at the same level when 400 ppm SO2 was introduced to the flue
   gas containing N-2 and HCl. The identification of the kinetics of
   heterogeneous oxidation of Hg-0 by chlorine in this study is of
   fundamental importance for scaling up mercury removal by selective
   catalytic reduction (SCR) plus wet flue gas desulfurization system
   (WFGD) from a laboratory system to a pilot or full scale. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The viscous and conductivity effects on the instability of a rapidly
   expanding material interface produced by a spherical shock tube are
   investigated through the employment of a high-order WENO scheme. The
   instability is influenced by various mechanisms, which include (a)
   classical Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) effects, (b) Bell-Plesset or
   geometry/curvature effects, (c) the effects of impulsively accelerating
   the interface, (d) compressibility effects, (e) finite thickness
   effects, and (f) viscous effects. Henceforth, the present instability
   studied is more appropriately referred to as non-classical RT
   instability to distinguish it from classical RT instability. The linear
   regime is examined and the development of the viscous three-dimensional
   perturbations is obtained by solving a one-dimensional system of partial
   differential equations. Numerical simulations are performed to
   illustrate the viscous effects on the growth of the disturbances for
   various conditions. The inviscid analysis does not show the existence of
   a maximum amplification rate. The present viscous analysis, however,
   shows that the growth rate increases with increasing the wave number,
   but there exists a peak wavenumber beyond which the growth rate
   decreases with increasing the wave number due to viscous effects.}},

Title = {{Wheat yield response to spatially variable nitrogen fertilizer in
   Mediterranean environment}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{65-70}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Farmers obtain high yield when proper crop management is matched with
   favourable weather. Nitrogen (N) fertilization is an important agronomic
   management practice because it affects profitability and the
   environment. In rainfed environments, farmers generally apply uniform
   rates of N without taking into account the spatial variability of soil
   available water or nutrient availability. Uniform application of
   fertilizer can lead to over or under-fertilization, decreasing the
   efficiency of the fertilizer use. The objective of this study was to
   evaluate the impact of variable rate nitrogen fertilizer application on
   spatial and temporal patterns of wheat grain yield. The study was
   conducted during the 2008/2009 and 2009/10 growing seasons in a 12 ha
   field near Foggia, Italy. The crop planted each year was durum wheat
   (Triticum durum, Desf.) cultivar Duilio. The field was subdivided into
   two management zones High (H), and Average (A). Three N rates were
   identified using a crop model tested on the same field during a previous
   growing season. The N rates were: low N (T1: 30 kg N ha(-1)), average N
   (T2: 70 kg N ha(-1)), and high N (T3: 90 kg N ha(-1)). The ANOVA test
   showed that there were no effects of the N levels for the first growing
   season for the H and A zone. For the 2009/10 growing season with higher
   rainfall there was a significant difference in grain yield for the A
   zone (2955 kg ha(-1)), but not in the H zone (3970 kg ha(-1)). This
   study demonstrates the optimal amount of N for a given management zone
   is not fixed but varies with the rainfall amount and distribution during
   the fallow and growing season. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   mechanisms}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AEROSOL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{88-100}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that bioaerosols can be inactivated in less
   than a second when exposed to temperatures of hundreds of degrees
   Celsius in an ultra-high temperature (UHT) process. Here, a new UHT
   system was developed to make UHT safer and more predictable, in which a
   heated porous cloth was oriented perpendicularly to the flow direction
   to produce more uniform flow temperatures. Infrared radiation, which can
   provide uniform heating for flat surfaces, was used to heat the cloth.
   Temperature measurements indicated that high temperatures were obtained
   at the cloth surface and that the downstream flow temperature was more
   axially uniform than radially/azimuthally uniform. For both Escherichia
   coli and MS2 virus test bioaerosols, the inactivations were found to be
   greater than 4.7 log for a cloth temperature of about 450 degrees C and
   residence time of 0.41 s. Results from gel electrophoresis showed that
   infraredUHT treatment resulted in DNA damages to E. coli. Besides lab
   testing, the UHT system was found to reduce the concentration of outdoor
   culturable bacteria by 12 orders of magnitude at 210 degrees C and
   residence time of 0.1 s, but was less effective against fungi. On the
   other hand, SEM imaging and sampling downstream of the cloth revealed
   that the cloth emitted unidentified particles. The results of the work
   proved that this IR system with its perpendicular orientation can
   achieve high temperatures and high bioaerosol disinfection, and can be
   used to better relate temperature to inactivation. Furthermore, the
   ambient inactivation data, which are not available in literature, allow
   insights into the real-world applications of an UHT system. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{Case-hardened steels, widely used in high-performance ball and roller
   bearings, have high surface hardness and a gradient in material
   properties (hardness, yield strength, etc.) as a function of depth;
   therefore, they behave as functionally graded materials. Understanding
   the mechanical properties due to gradients in the subsurface
   microstructure of case-hardened steels is important for modeling the
   effects of cyclic damage induced by rolling contact fatigue. In the
   current study, two different commercially available case-carburized
   steels (P675, M-50 NiL) and two through-hardened steels (M-50, case
   P675) were characterized to obtain relationships among the volume
   fraction of subsurface carbides, indentation hardness, elastic modulus,
   and yield strength as a function of depth. A variety of methods
   including microindentation, nanoindentation, ultrasonic measurements,
   compression testing, rule of mixtures, and upper and lower bound models
   were used to determine the above relationships and compare the
   experimental results with model predictions. In addition, the
   morphology, composition, and properties of the carbide particles are
   also discussed. It was found that the subsurface hardness and volume
   fraction of carbides are linearly related. Finally, it was found that
   the estimation of composite modulus from a well-established model
   compares with measurements from the ultrasonic method and compression
   tests. The results presented are of immediate engineering relevance to
   the bearing industry, with importance to modeling of microstructure and
   its effects on rolling contact fatigue life.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new comparator design featuring wide-range and high-speed
   operation using only conventional digital CMOS cells. Our comparator
   exploits a novel scalable parallel prefix structure that leverages the
   comparison outcome of the most significant bit, proceeding bitwise
   toward the least significant bit only when the compared bits are equal.
   This method reduces dynamic power dissipation by eliminating unnecessary
   transitions in a parallel prefix structure that generates the N-bit
   comparison result after inverted right perpendicularlog(4) Ninverted
   left perpendicular + inverted right perpendicularlog(16) Ninverted left
   perpendicular + 4 CMOS gate delays. Our comparator is composed of
   locally interconnected CMOS gates with a maximum fan-in and fan-out of
   five and four, respectively, independent of the comparator bitwidth. The
   main advantages of our design are high speed and power efficiency,
   maintained over a wide range. Additionally, our design uses a regular
   reconfigurable VLSI topology, which allows analytical derivation of the
   input-output delay as a function of bitwidth. HSPICE simulation for a
   64-b comparator shows a worst case input-output delay of 0.86 ns and a
   maximum power dissipation of 7.7 mW using 0.15-mu m TSMC technology at 1
   GHz.}},

Abstract = {{A comparative study of etch characteristics of the InGaZnO4 (IGZO) films
   has been performed in chlorine-(Cl-2 and BCl3) and fluorine-based (CF4
   and SF6) inductively coupled plasmas (ICPs). Higher IGZO etch rates were
   achieved with chlorine-based discharges due to the higher volatility of
   metal chloride etch products. The IGZO etch rate was significantly
   affected by ICP source power and rf chuck power, and maximum etch rates
   of similar to 1200 mu/min and similar to 1350 angstrom/min were obtained
   in fluorine-based and Cl-2/Ar discharges, respectively. The etched
   surface morphologies of IGZO in 10BCl(3)/5Ar mixtures were better than
   the unetched control sample. Maximum etch selectivities of 1.4: 1 for
   IGZO over HfO2, 3.1: 1 for IGZO over Al2O3, and 1.2: 1 for IGZO over
   yttria-stabilized zirconia were obtained. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Here, we report a scalable bottom-up approach for fabricating periodic
   arrays of metal nanorings and nanocrescents. Wafer-scale monolayer
   silica colloidal crystals with an unusual non-close-packed structure
   prepared by a simple and rapid spin-coating technology are used as both
   etching and shadowing masks to create nanoring-shaped trenches in
   between templated polymer posts and sacrificial nanoholes. Directional
   deposition of metals in the trenches followed by liftoff of the polymer
   posts and the sacrificial nanoholes results in forming ordered metal
   nanorings. The inner and outer radii of the final nanorings are
   determined by the sizes of the templated polymer posts and the silica
   microspheres which can be easily adjusted by tuning the spin-coating and
   templating conditions. Most importantly, by simply controlling the tilt
   angle of the substrate toward the directional metal beams, continuous
   geometric transition from concentric nanorings to eccentric nanorings to
   nanocrescents can be achieved. This new colloidal templating approach is
   compatible with standard semiconductor microfabrication, promising for
   mass-production and on-chip integration of periodic nanorings and
   nanocrescents for a wide spectrum of technological applications ranging
   from nanooptical devices and ultrasensitive biosensing to magnetic
   memories and logic circuits. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},

Abstract = {{Apathy and depression are heterogeneous syndromes with symptoms that
   overlap clinically. This clinical overlap leads to problems with
   classification and diagnosis in clinical populations. No functional
   imaging study has attempted to separate brain regions altered in apathy
   from those altered in depression in a clinical population. Parkinson
   disease (PD) is a disorder in which apathy and depression co-exist in a
   single population. We evaluate the relationship between apathy,
   depression, and motor severity of disease in PD, focusing on the
   relationship between these factors and the amplitude of the low
   frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in the resting state. We first evaluated if
   the resting ALFF signal is a reliable measure for our clinical question.
   For this, we develop and introduce a cross validation approach we term
   the ``Regional Mapping of Reliable Differences{''} (RMRD) method to
   evaluate reliability of regions of interest deemed ``significant{''} by
   standard voxel-wise techniques. Using this approach, we show that the
   apathy score in this sample is best predicted by ALFF signal in the left
   supplementary motor cortex, the right orbitofrontal cortex, and the
   right middle frontal cortex, whereas depression score is best predicted
   by ALFF signal in the right subgenual cingulate. Disease severity was
   best predicted by ALFF signal in the right putamen. A number of
   additional regions are also statistically (but not reliably) correlated
   with our neuropsychological measures and disease severity. Our results
   support the use of resting fMRI as a means to evaluate neuropsychiatric
   states and motor disease progression in Parkinson disease, and the
   clinical and epidemiologic observation that apathy and depression are
   distinct pathological entities. Our finding that ``significance{''} and
   ``reliability{''} are dissociated properties of regions of interest
   identified as significant using standard voxel-wise techniques suggests
   that including reliability analyses may add useful scientific
   information in neurobehavioral research. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Ion exchange in a fluidized bed has been shown to be an effective design
   for anion and cation exchange. However, little is known about combining
   anion and cation exchange resins in the same vessel. More specifically,
   can combined ion exchange be predicted by adding the removal of anions
   during anion exchange to the removal of cations during cation exchange?
   Results indicated that combined ion exchange can reduce precipitation of
   sparingly soluble minerals, such as CaCO3, in the bulk solution by
   simultaneously removing calcium and bicarbonate. Inorganic cations
   dominated the ion exchange behavior during these processes, and organic
   anions such as dissolved organic matter (DOM) behaved the same in
   combined ion exchange as in anion exchange. Results showed that it is
   possible to estimate sulfate and magnesium removal during combined ion
   exchange by rules of superposition, as well as calcium when initial
   concentration of calcium is low. Synthetic waters with varying divalent
   cations were compared to a natural groundwater, both of which had low
   organics and high divalent cations. Results showed similar behavior
   between natural and synthetic waters with varying types of DOM. The
   effect of combined ion exchange on separation factors is also calculated
   and discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{{[}1] We investigate individual X-ray bursts from lightning leaders to
   determine if energetic electrons at the source (and hence X-rays) are
   emitted isotropically or with some degree of anisotropy. This study was
   motivated by the work of Saleh et al. (2009), which found the falloff of
   X-rays in concentric radial annuli, covering all azimuthal directions in
   each annulus, from the lightning channel to be most consistent with an
   isotropic electron source. Here we perform a statistical analysis of
   angular and spatial distributions of X-rays measured by up to 21 NaI/PMT
   detectors at the International Center for Lightning Research and Testing
   site for 21 leader X-ray bursts from five leaders (including four
   dart-stepped leaders and one dart leader). Two procedures were used to
   complete this analysis. Procedure 1 found the first-order anisotropy,
   and procedure 2 tested whether or not the angular distribution was
   consistent with an isotropic distribution. Because higher-order
   anisotropies could be present in the data, a distribution that is not
   isotropic does not necessarily have a significant first-order
   anisotropy. Using these procedures, we find that at least 11 out of 21
   X-ray bursts have a statistically significant first-order anisotropy,
   and hence those 11 are inconsistent with an isotropic emission. The
   remaining 10 bursts do not have significant first-order anisotropy.
   However, of those 10 bursts, 9 are inconsistent with isotropic emission,
   since they exhibit significant higher-order anisotropies. Since Saleh et
   al. (2009) did not consider anisotropies in the azimuthal direction,
   these new measurements of anisotropy do not necessarily contradict that
   work. Indeed, our analysis supports the finding that the X-ray emissions
   from lightning are inconsistent with a vertically downward beam. The
   level of anisotropy of the runaway electrons is important because it
   provides, in principle, information on the streamer zone in front of the
   leader and the electric field near the lightning leader tip.}},

Abstract = {{The present study was carried out to evaluate transformation kinetics of
   derivatized fullerene species by simulating natural aquatic processes,
   which will help elucidate biological effects of water-stirred nano-C-60
   (aqu-nC(60)). Physicochemical analyses of aqu-nC(60) included molecular
   and agglomerate-scale characterization, surface charge analysis through
   examination of electrophoretic mobility, and chemical composition
   analysis using spectroscopy. Detailed analysis of aqu-nC(60)
   transformation over a 28-day stirring period in both light and dark
   conditions indicated aqu-nC(60) agglomerate concentrations can be
   estimated as a time-function using a predictor model (R-2 > 0.99).
   Number-weighted agglomerate size did not differ significantly over the
   28-day stirring period regardless of photocondition, although size
   distributions were more uniform as stirring time increased. The total
   number of surface groups identified through XPS indicated increased
   derivatization as a function of time with additions assigned to
   mono-oxygenated carbon moieties while the number of di-oxygenated
   moieties declined. Earlier-phase stirring (t <= 14 days) products were
   shown to contain epoxide surface groups, which were absent in
   later-phase (t > 14 days) suspensions, suggesting specific pathways to
   derivatization with preferential mono-oxygenated states. Filter residue,
   a by-product of the aqu-nC(60) synthesis process, demonstrated high
   hydrophobicity and FTIR spectra similar to underivatized material,
   suggesting synthesis process inefficiencies.}},

Abstract = {{This work investigated the effects of solution pH and surface metal
   oxyhydroxides on the transport behaviors of carboxyl-functionalized
   graphene (GR) in saturated porous media. Column experiments were
   conducted to elucidate the transport behavior of functionalized GR in
   acid-cleaned and natural sand under different solution pH conditions
   (i.e., 5.6 and 8.3). The results showed that the functionalized GR was
   highly mobile in the acid-cleaned sand columns at both pH 5.6 and 8.3
   with recovery rates close to 100 \%. The deposition of the
   functionalized GR was higher in the natural sand columns, and the
   recovery rates were 88.4 and 96.5 \% for pH 5.6 and 8.3, respectively.
   The reductions of the mobility of the functionalized GR in the natural
   sand columns could be caused by the interaction between carboxyl
   functional groups of the GR and the surface metal hydroxides on the sand
   grains, which is pH dependent. An advection-dispersion-reaction model
   was applied to the data and successfully simulated the transport of the
   functionalized GR through the acid-cleaned and natural sand columns.}},

Abstract = {{Codoping ceria with rare earth elements has been shown to enhance grain
   ionic conductivity above that of singly doped materials. However, our
   recent work using a codoping scheme with Sm3+ and Nd3+ showed that 1:1
   codoping results in conductivity intermediate between the respective
   singly doped samples, with Nd-doped ceria being higher than Sm- and
   Gd-doped. More recent studies have shown that small amounts (2-3\%) of a
   second dopant can significantly enhance conductivity. Here we apply this
   scheme to the SmxNdyCe0.9O2-delta system with varying x/y codopant
   ratio. Samples were prepared using solid state reactions and
   conductivity measurements were done using two-point ac electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy from 250-700 degrees C. Activation energy values
   were calculated from Arrhenius plots and increase as dopants shift from
   pure Sm3+ to pure Nd3+ in agreement with literature and the effective
   index. More importantly, the results of this study conclude that
   codopant ratio (x/y) variations within the SmxNdyCe(0.9)O(2-delta)
   system does not lead to significant conductivity changes and thus it
   constitutes a versatile system impervious to potential performance
   degradation due to preferential dopant segregation and redistribution.

Abstract = {{Botany Bay Plantation Wildlife Management Area is one of only four known
   natural nesting sites for least terns (Sternula antillarum) on the South
   Carolina coast, and more than 20,000 people visit the 3-mile stretch of
   beach each nesting season since it opened to the public in 2008. We
   developed a simulation model for the adaptive management of human
   disturbance on nesting habitat for least terns, which is described using
   the ODD (Overview, Design Concepts, and Details) protocol. The
   simulation uses the Questions and Decisions (QnD) system framework, an
   object-oriented modeling approach that emphasizes interactions among key
   ecological and social components. The model is designed to explore the
   potential results of management actions and identify key indicators for
   future monitoring. Initial model parameters were developed from existing
   literature, expert opinion and on-site ecological observations as few
   baseline data were available for the recently opened site. In addition,
   substantial uncertainty surrounded the nesting behavior of least terns
   related to productivity levels, responses to human disturbance, and
   overwash tides. In order to test model assumptions and performance,
   parameters are assigned stochastic probability distributions made
   explicit to wildlife managers and can be updated as additional
   monitoring data become available. Simulation results suggest that Botany
   Bay colonies are at significant risk of collapse. Monte Carlo
   simulations of the model (n=500) show that current management practices
   result in a median productivity of 0.08 fledglings per breeding adult,
   well below the minimum productivity threshold of 0.13 needed to
   encourage site fidelity. But closing one particular section of beach
   during the nesting season would result in a global median productivity
   of 0.26. A sensitivity analysis identified one variable in particular as
   important to monitor for reducing uncertainty in model results: the
   duration of tern defense response from human disturbance and the
   variation of this response among spatial units. These simulation results
   are intended to initiate an ongoing and adaptive monitoring program for
   improving colony productivity at the site. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We have developed a model for the prediction of cell attachment to
   engineered microtopographies based on two previous models: the
   attachment point theory and the engineered roughness index (ER!) model.
   The new surface energetic attachment (SEA) model is based on both the
   properties of the cell material interface and the size and configuration
   of the topography relative to the organism. We have used Monte Carlo
   simulation to examine the SEA model's ability to predict relative
   attachment of the green alga Ulva linza to different locations within a
   unit cell. We have also compared the predicted relative attachment for
   Ulva linza, the diatom Navicula incerta, the marine bacterium Cobetia
   marina, and the barnacle cyprid Balanus amphitrite to a wide variety of
   microtopographies. We demonstrate good correlation between the
   experimental results and the model results for all tested experimental
   data and thus show the SEA model may be used as a powerful indicator of
   the efficacy for antifouling topographies.}},

Abstract = {{The mammalian hippocampus functions to encode and retrieve memories by
   transiently changing synaptic strengths, yet encoding in individual
   subregions for transmission between regions remains poorly understood.
   Toward the goal of better understanding the coding in the trisynaptic
   pathway from the dentate gyrus (DG) to the CA3 and CA1, we report a
   novel microfabricated device that divides a micro-electrode array into
   two compartments of separate hippocampal network subregions connected by
   axons that grow through 3 x 10 x 400 mu m tunnels. Gene expression by
   qPCR demonstrated selective enrichment of separate DG, CA3, and CA1
   subregions. Reconnection of DG to CA3 altered burst dynamics associated
   with marked enrichment of GAD67 in DG and GFAP in CA3. Surprisingly, DG
   axon spike propagation was preferentially unidirectional to the CA3
   region at 0.5m/s with little reverse transmission. Therefore, select
   hippocampal subregions intrinsically self-wire in anatomically
   appropriate patterns and maintain their distinct subregion phenotype
   without external inputs.}},

Abstract = {{Pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR was used to investigate the
   self-diffusion of carbon dioxide in alumina stabilized samaria aerogel
   catalyst, a promising porous catalyst for gas-phase reactions featuring
   high porosity and high surface area. For diffusion studies, the catalyst
   was prepared in two sample packing types, macroscopic monoliths (i.e.,
   macroscopic cylindrical particles) and powder beds with particle sizes
   around 200 mu m that are considered for catalytic applications. Studies
   of diffusion in these samples revealed how macroscopic packing
   influences the catalyst transport properties. Application of a high
   magnetic field of 17.6 T in the reported PFG NMR studies enabled
   diffusion measurements for relatively low carbon dioxide densities in
   the catalyst samples corresponding to a gas loading pressure of around
   0.1 atm. As a result, it was possible to perform diffusion measurements
   for a large range of carbon dioxide loading pressures between 0.1 and 10
   atm. The measured carbon dioxide diffusivities in the beds of catalyst
   particles are interpreted in the context of a simple diffusion-mediated
   exchange model previously used for zeolites and other porous materials.

Abstract = {{Essential tremor (ET) is a common tremor disorder affecting
   postural/action tremor of the upper extremities and midline. Recent
   research revealed a cerebellar-like deficit during tandem gait in
   persons with ET, though spatiotemporal variability during normal gait in
   ET has been relatively ignored. The first purpose of this study was to
   investigate gait variability magnitude and structure in ET as compared
   to healthy older adults (HOA). To address this issue, 11 ET and 11
   age-matched HOAs walked on a treadmill for 5 min at preferred walking
   speeds. HOAs walked for an additional minute while speed-matched to an
   ET participant. The second purpose was to describe the clinical
   correlates of gait variability in this population. To address this aim,
   31 persons with ET walked on a treadmill for 5 min and completed the
   Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale. Gait variability magnitude was
   derived by calculating coefficients of variation in stride length,
   stride time, step length, step time, and step width. Gait variability
   structure was derived using a detrended fluctuation analysis technique.
   At preferred walking speeds, ET participants walked significantly slower
   with significantly increased variability magnitude in all five
   spatiotemporal gait parameters. At speed-matched walking, ET
   participants exhibited significantly higher step width variability. Gait
   variability structure was not different between groups. We also observed
   that gait variability magnitude was predicted by severity of upper
   extremity and midline tremors. This study revealed that self-selected

Abstract = {{We investigated the growth and partial reduction of Sm2O3(111) thin
   films on Pt(111) using low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and
   scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We find that the Sm2O3(111) films
   are high quality and grow in a defective fluorite structure wherein the
   Sm cations adopt a hexagonal (1.37 X 1.37) lattice in registry with the
   Pt(111) surface, while oxygen vacancies are randomly distributed within
   the film. STM measurements show that Sm2O3(111) film growth on Pt(111)
   occurs by the Stranski-Krastanov mechanism, in which a single O-Sm-O
   trilayer initially forms, followed by the growth of well-defined,
   multilayer islands. The Sm2O3(111) films undergo partial reduction
   during annealing at 1000 K in ultrahigh vacuum. LEED and STM provide
   evidence that a fraction of the Sm2O3 in the first layer, closest to the
   Pt( 111) substrate, decomposes to produce well-ordered domains of
   rocksalt SmO(100) during reduction, and that Sm2O3 from the third and
   higher layers concurrently spreads onto the first layer to form a more
   contiguous second layer of Sm2O3(111). We show that the SmO(100) and
   Sm2O3(111) lattices can form a coincidence structure with minimal strain
   to the Sm-atom sublattices, and that satellite features observed in the
   LEED patterns are consistent with the coexistence of SmO(100) and
   Sm2O3(111) domains as well as the proposed Sm2O3(111)/SmO(100)
   coincidence structure. Lastly, we find that reoxidation of the partially
   reduced films restores the original Sm2O3(111) crystal structure, and
   significantly improves the film quality, as reflected by a flatter film
   morphology and better connectivity among oxide domains. An implication
   from this study is that the formation of (100)-oriented monoxide
   structures is a general characteristic of the reduction of rare-earth
   oxide thin films on hexagonally close-packed metal surfaces.}},

Title = {{Form-Finding Model Shows How Cytoskeleton Network Stiffness Is Realized}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 17}},
Abstract = {{In eukaryotic cells the actin-cytoskeletal network provides stiffness
   and the driving force that contributes to changes in cell shape and cell
   motility, but the elastic behavior of this network is not well
   understood. In this paper a two dimensional form-finding model is
   proposed to investigate the elasticity of the actin filament network.
   Utilizing an initially random array of actin filaments and
   actin-cross-linking proteins the form-finding model iterates until the
   random array is brought into a stable equilibrium configuration. With
   some care given to actin filament density and length, distance between
   host sites for cross-linkers, and overall domain size the resulting
   configurations from the form-finding model are found to be topologically
   similar to cytoskeletal networks in real cells. The resulting network
   may then be mechanically exercised to explore how the actin filaments
   deform and align under load and the sensitivity of the network's
   stiffness to actin filament density, length, etc. Results of the model
   are consistent with the experimental literature, e. g. actin filaments
   tend to re-orient in the direction of stretching; and the filament
   relative density, filament length, and actin-cross-linking protein's
   relative density, control the actin-network stiffness. The model
   provides a ready means of extension to more complicated domains and a
   three-dimensional form-finding model is under development as well as
   models studying the formation of actin bundles.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is increasing in many drinking water
   supplies, which can have adverse impacts on treatment. Magnetic ion
   exchange (MIEX) is an advanced treatment process that has been shown to
   effectively remove DOM from different water sources. DOM removal
   efficiency is typically determined through dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC) and ultraviolet absorbance (UVA) measurements, but these methods
   can be limited in the amount of information they provide on DOM.
   Fluorescence spectroscopy has been suggested as a more robust
   characterization technique for monitoring DOM, but there remain gaps in
   knowledge between DOM removal processes and fluorescence
   characterization of DOM. Accordingly, the goal of this research was to
   evaluate the impact of MIEX treatment on DOM fluorescence for diverse
   water sources. MIEX jar tests were conducted using surface water,
   synthetic water, groundwater, and landfill leachate wastewater, and
   analyzed for DOC, UVA, and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix
   (EEM). Fluorescence EEMs were used to determine fluorophore location,
   intensity, and fluorescence index. MIEX removal of DOC and UVA were
   strongly correlated with MIEX removal of peak fluorescence intensity
   across all water sources. Peak fluorescence location indicated that MIEX
   preferentially removed terrestrial DOM. Fluorescence is a promising tool
   for monitoring DOM removal efficiency by MIEX treatment.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of both cohesive and cohesionless particles in estuarine
   and lacustrine sediments makes it essential to model bed exchange of
   both types of particles. The usual practice is to select a purely
   empirical estimate of particle diameter marking the transition between
   the two behaviors. Based on available data on particle erosion and
   deposition in non-oscillating flows and viscoplastic properties of bed
   sediment, we have attempted to examine the likelihood of identifying the
   transition diameter within a less empirical framework. From the
   relationship between diameter and bed shear stress for a variety of
   cohesive and cohesionless sediments, it appears that two transition
   diameters can be defined. One is the largest diameter of clay mineral
   particles at which cohesion is considered to vanish. The other is the
   smallest diameter at which cohesionless behavior is assumed to end at
   the limit of the well-known Shields' relationship extended to very fine
   particles. These two diameters appear to be reasonably close for mainly
   inorganic mineral sediments. Assuming they are equal, six zones of bed
   exchange are identified in terms of diameter and bed shear stress.
   Depending on these two variables, zones of only erosion, no erosion or
   deposition, and only deposition can be designated. Realistic modeling of
   bed exchange of multi-size sediments requires that the full range of
   diameters be considered. Extension of this analysis to organic-rich
   sediments is pending better understanding of their rheological
   properties. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Key in predicting stability in sands during dynamic events is gaining a
   fundamental understanding of the physics of its deformation and failure
   at high pressures. In this paper are reported results of an experimental
   investigation into the high-pressure (up to 700MPa) mechanical response
   of Quikrete sand. During all triaxial compression tests, the material
   exhibited hardening up to failure while both compressibility and
   dilatancy regimes of the volumetric response were observed. Furthermore,
   the transition from compressibility to dilatancy was found to be highly
   dependent on confining pressure. By performing triaxial compression
   tests with several creep stages followed by unloading-reloading cycles,
   the time influence of the overall response was detected. Using the
   experimental data, a new model that captures both compressibility and
   dilatancy has been developed. Comparison between model predictions and
   data showed that the proposed model describes well the main
   characteristics of the high-pressure response of sand. Copyright (c)

   barrier for transport across flexible lipid membranes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{139}},
Number = {{13}},
Month = {{OCT 7}},
Abstract = {{Transport of a fullerene-like nanoparticle across a lipid bilayer is
   investigated by coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.
   Potentials of mean force (PMF) acting on the nanoparticle in a flexible
   bilayer suspended in water and a bilayer restrained to a flat surface
   are computed by constrained MD simulations. The rate of the nanoparticle
   transport into the bilayer interior is predicted using one-dimensional
   Langevin models based on these PMFs. The predictions are compared with
   the transport rates obtained from a series of direct (unconstrained) MD
   simulations of the solute transport into the flexible bilayer. It is
   observed that the PMF acting on the solute in the flexible membrane
   underestimates the transport rate by more than an order of magnitude
   while the PMF acting on the solute in the restrained membrane yields an
   accurate estimate of the activation energy for transport into the
   flexible membrane. This paradox is explained by a coexistence of
   metastable membrane configurations for a range of the solute positions
   inside and near the flexible membrane. This leads to a significant
   reduction of the contribution of the transition state to the mean force
   acting on the solute. Restraining the membrane shape ensures that there
   is only one stable membrane configuration corresponding to each solute
   position and thus the transition state is adequately represented in the
   PMF. This mechanism is quite general and thus this phenomenon is
   expected to occur in a wide range of interfacial systems. A simple model
   for the free energy landscape of the coupled solute-membrane system is
   proposed and validated. This model explicitly accounts for effects of
   the membrane deformations on the solute transport and yields an accurate
   prediction of the activation energy for the solute transport. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Age-related macular degeneration is a leading cause of vision loss for

   Radiotherapy System, developed by Oraya (R) Therapeutics, Inc., is a
   stereotactic low-voltage irradiation system designed to treat the wet
   form of the disease. The IRay System uses three robotically positioned
   100 kVp collimated photon beams to deliver an absorbed dose of up to 24
   Gy to the macula. The present study uses the Monte Carlo radiation
   transport code MCNPX to assess absorbed dose to six non-targeted tissues
   within the eye-total lens, radiosensitive tissues of the lens, optic
   nerve, distal tip of the central retinal artery, non-targeted portion of
   the retina, and the ciliary body-all as a function of eye size and beam
   entry angle. The ocular axial length was ranged from 20 to 28 mm in 2 mm
   increments, with the polar entry angle of the delivery system varied
   from 18 degrees to 34 degrees in 2 degrees increments. The resulting
   data showed insignificant variations in dose for all eye sizes. Slight
   variations in the dose to the optic nerve and the distal tip of the
   central retinal artery were noted as the polar beam angle changed. An
   increase in non-targeted retinal dose was noted as the entry angle
   increased, while the dose to the lens, sensitive volume of the lens, and
   ciliary body decreased as the treatment polar angle increased. Polar
   angles of 26 degrees or greater resulted in no portion of the sensitive
   volume of the lens receiving an absorbed dose of 0.5 Gy or greater. All
   doses to non-targeted structures reported in this study were less than
   accepted thresholds for post-procedure complications.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Recently, researchers have proposed penalized maximum likelihood to
   identify network topology underlying a dynamical system modeled by
   multivariate time series. The time series of interest are assumed to be
   stationary, but this restriction is never taken into consideration by
   existing estimation methods. Moreover, practical problems of interest
   may have ultra-high dimensionality and obvious node collinearity. In
   addition, none of the available algorithms provides a probabilistic
   measure of the uncertainty for the obtained network topology which is
   informative in reliable network identification. The main purpose of this
   paper is to tackle these challenging issues. We propose the S-2 learning
   framework, which stands for stationary-sparse network learning. We
   propose a novel algorithm referred to as the Berhu iterative sparsity
   pursuit with stationarity (BISPS), where the Berhu regularization can
   improve the Lasso in detection and estimation. The algorithm is
   extremely easy to implement, efficient in computation and has a
   theoretical guarantee to converge to a global optimum. We also
   incorporate a screening technique into BISPS to tackle ultra-high
   dimensional problems and enhance computational efficiency. Furthermore,
   a stationary bootstrap technique is applied to provide connection
   occurring frequency for reliable topology learning. Experiments show
   that our method can achieve stationary and sparse causality network
   learning and is scalable for high-dimensional problems.}},

Abstract = {{Tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO) has been shown to alter the
   biomechanics of the femorotibial joint; however, the effect of TPLO on
   patellofemoral (PF) joint alignment remains unknown. The purpose of this
   study was to evaluate PF joint kinematics before and after cranial
   cruciate ligament (CrCL) transection and following TPLO in a cadaveric
   stifle model with set patellar tendon load, tested in passive range of
   motion at 90 degrees, 105 degrees, 120 degrees, 135 degrees and 150
   degrees of flexion. The PF joint poses were measured on mediolateral
   projection radiographs using a two-dimensional computer digitization
   technique. In the subluxated CrCL-deficient stifle, the PF joint had an
   increase in patellar tilt angle. In the reduced CrCL-deficient stifle
   treated by TPLO, there was distal and caudal displacement of the patella
   relative to the femur and a decreased patellar tilt angle. The estimated
   patellar moment arm following TPLO was not different from the control
   stifle. On the basis of these results, TPLO alters PF joint kinematics.
   The changes in PF joint alignment induced by TPLO may be a biomechanical
   factor predisposing to patellar tendonitis following TPLO. (C) 2013

Title = {{Impact of Household Location on First-Year Engineering Students'

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{102}},

Abstract = {{Background To prepare engineers for their future roles,
   responsibilities, and professional demands, undergraduate engineering
   programs must integrate sustainable design into their curricula. Hence,
   we need to understand engineering students' awareness, conceptions, and,
   particularly, their prior knowledge and what shaped it.
   Purpose This study proposed to examine the impact of their home location
   on engineering students' environmental awareness and resistance to
   change.
   Design/Method We administered two environmental surveys to students in a
   first-year undergraduate engineering program. First, a macrolevel
   analysis focused on differences between students from different U. S.
   regions and international students. Then, to examine differences
   hypothesized in our environmental awareness model at the zip code-level
   (students' household location, i.e., location from which they applied to
   college), we focused on first-year engineering students with Indiana zip
   codes (n = 1,367).
   Results Significant differences appeared in environmental awareness and
   knowledge according to students' household location (U. S. regions and
   international). As a result, we created a predictive model of the
   students' environmental knowledge, awareness, attitudes, and resistance
   to change using a GIS location-based model.
   Conclusions This study extends the existing literature and provides a
   starting point for further exploring these relationships with
   engineering students. Since engineering programs provide different
   experiences to students, this study cautiously supports the idea that
   student household location has an impact and should be considered a
   viable variable. Further work is necessary to study the impact of
   location-based class projects on the students' awareness and knowledge
   about sustainability and environmental issues.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the active case of a variable stiffness suspension
   system. The central concept is based on a recently designed variable
   stiffness mechanism which consists of a horizontal control strut and a
   vertical strut. The horizontal strut is used to vary the load transfer
   ratio by actively controlling the location of the point of attachment of
   the vertical strut to the car body. The control algorithm, effected by a
   hydraulic actuator, uses the concept of nonlinear energy sink (NES) to
   effectively transfer the vibrational energy in the sprung mass to a
   control mass, thereby reducing the transfer of energy from road
   disturbance to the car body at a relatively lower cost compared to the
   traditional active suspension using the skyhook concept. The analyses
   and simulation results show that a better performance can be achieved by
   subjecting the point of attachment of a suspension system, to the
   chassis, to the influence of a horizontal NES system.}},

Abstract = {{A citrus processing facility produces significant quantities of both
   peel waste and wastewater. A leach bed batch anaerobic digester was
   operated successfully at thermophilic (55 degrees C) temperature for
   biogasification of citrus peel waste. The retention time in the digester
   was 25 days. The citrus processing wastewater was digested in a
   thermophilic DSFF (down flow stationary fixed film) anaerobic reactor
   fed continuously and operated for 76 days. At an average organic loading
   rate of 0.51 kg sCOD m(-3) d(-1) the hydraulic retention time was 16
   days. No long term toxicity issues due to limonene were observed during
   digestion of both citrus waste feedstocks. Biogasification yielded,
   0.116 m(3) methane at STP kg(-1) peel waste received and 2.1 m(3) at STP
   m(-3) wastewater received. An energy analysis showed that in a citrus
   processing plant handling 600 tons per day of fruits, the biogas
   produced from the waste streams is more than sufficient to meet all the
   electricity and fuel demands. Excess electricity generated from biogas
   may be sold generating estimated revenues of more than a \$1 million
   annually (at electricity sale price of \$0.04/kWh(e)). (C) 2013 Elsevier

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MATERIALS AND TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},

Abstract = {{Materials with customized spatial gradients in mechanical properties are
   increasingly used in high performance applications requiring enhanced
   resistance to contact loads, wear, and fatigue. In many engineering
   materials, multiple property and microstructural gradients may occur
   simultaneously with depth. In this manuscript, two case carburized
   steels are analyzed for their gradient in hardness with depth,
   emphasizing the resulting variation in surface hardness under increasing
   indentation loads. A parametric study using finite element analysis is
   then conducted in order to characterize the influence of individual
   property gradients on the surface indentation response of graded
   materials. It is shown that the measured surface hardness value
   decreases rapidly under increasing surface indentation loads in
   materials with sharp negative hardness gradients. It is also shown that
   this trend is independent of the magnitude of the strain hardening
   exponent of the material, as well as the gradient in strain hardening
   exponent. Gradients in elastic properties were also shown to have
   negligible influence on surface hardness trends for a fixed gradient in
   hardness. Finally, it is revealed that the depth of subsurface plastic
   deformation increases with sharper gradients in hardness, while being
   insensitive to changes in strain hardening exponent. For elastically
   graded materials, a decreasing gradient in elastic modulus limits the
   depth of plastic deformation.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectivesLiposome (LIP)-like lipid dispersions have emerged as useful
   detoxification vehicles in vitro. The authors compare resuscitation with
   tailored LIPs, 20\% intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE), and sodium
   bicarbonate (BIC), in a rabbit model of clomipramine toxicity.
   MethodsSedated, instrumented New Zealand white rabbits underwent
   clomipramine infusion at 3.2mg/kg/min to 50\% baseline mean arterial
   pressure (MAP) and then at 1.6mg/kg/min for 30minutes. BIC (3mL/kg
   8.4\%), ILE (3mL/kg 20\%), or LIP (24mg/kg) were infused as rescue
   treatments at toxicity and were repeated at 10minutes (n=5 in each
   group).
   ResultsThirty-minute MAP was greatest in ILE-treated animals: 61mmHg ILE
   (interquartile range {[}IQR]= 49 to 64mmHg), 43mmHg LIP (IQR= 36.5 to
   49mmHg), and 10mmHg BIC (IQR= 10 to 44mmHg; all p=0.02). Two of the five
   BIC-treated animals survived to 30minutes, compared with all five of the
   ILE-treated animals and all five of the LIP-treated animals (p=0.044).
   ConclusionsBoth ILE and LIPs improved hemodynamic recovery compared with
   bicarbonate in clomipramine-induced cardiotoxicity in rabbits. Greater
   30-minute MAP was observed in the ILE group. ConclusionesTanto la ELI
   como los L mejoran la recuperacion hemodinamica en compracion con el B
   en la cardiotoxicidad inducida por clomipramina en los conejos. Se
   observaron mayores PAM a los 30 minutos en el grupo tratado con la ELI.}},

Abstract = {{Development of central nervous system-acting drugs would be enhanced by
   suitable biomarkers that reflect the targeted pathophysiologic brain
   state. The electroencephalogram (EEG) has several characteristics of an
   ideal biomarker and can be promptly adapted to pre-clinical and clinical
   testing. The aim of this study was to evaluate EEG as a measure of the
   wakefulness-promoting effect of armodafinil in sleep deprived healthy
   subjects. Armodafinil pharmacodynamics were simultaneously assessed by
   EEG- and behavioral-based measures including a well-established measure
   of alertness. Using two quantitative EEG-based measurespower spectral
   and event-related brain activity analyseswe observed that armodafinil
   mitigated the slowing of brain activity and the decrease of the
   event-related brain activity caused by sleep deprivation.
   Armodafinil-induced changes in EEG are in agreement and explain up to
   73.1\% of the armodafinil-induced changes in alertness. Our findings
   suggest that EEG can serve as a marker of the wakefulness-promoting drug
   effect.}},

Abstract = {{A magnetic field-assisted finishing (MAF) process has been developed to

   these optics, a clear understanding of the MAF process' material removal
   mechanisms has not been attained. In an attempt to discover these
   mechanisms, the MAF process is applied to a flat workpiece, allowing for
   direct observation and tracking of changes to distinctive surface
   features before and after MAF. Atomic force microscopy, field-emission
   scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
   are used to analyze the surface morphology and composition with respect
   to finishing time. These observations suggest that the MAF process
   modified the surface, reducing surface roughness (from 0.8 nm to 0.6 nm

   due to a retiming scheme. To the authors' best knowledge, this MMD has
   demonstrated to date the highest operating frequency static MMD with
   retiming function in CMOS. Due to its static implementation, this MMD
   can operate from 19 GHz down to close to dc with programmable division

Abstract = {{Atomic-level simulation methods are used to determine the interaction of
   a metallic fission product, Ru4+, with the core of a(o)/2 < 1 1 0 >\{1 1
   0\} and a(o)/2 < 1 1 0 >\{001\} edge dislocations in UO2, experimentally
   the most active slip systems. Specifically, the segregation behavior of
   Ru4+ is examined at the cationic substitution site; comparisons are made
   with both continuum-elastic results and with the results of atomistic
   simulations on strained single crystals. The results on strained single
   crystals suggest that segregation behavior is a strong function of the
   elastic strain field around the detailed atomic structure at the
   dislocation core. Furthermore, the segregation is affected by the
   orientation of the dislocation and electrostatic interactions at the
   atomic defect site. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An interatomic potential for zirconium is developed within the
   charge-optimized many-body (COMB) formalism. The potential correctly
   predicts the hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure as the ground state

   octahedral followed by basal split, in agreement with recent first
   principles calculations. Stacking fault energies within the prism and
   basal planes satisfactorily match first principles calculations. A
   tensile test using nanocrystalline zirconium exhibits both prismatic
   \{10 (1) over bar0\}(11 (2) over bar0) slip and pyramidal \{11 (2) over
   bar2\}< 11 (2) over bar(3) over bar > slip, showing the model is capable

Title = {{Pediatric radiation dosimetry for positron-emitting radionuclides using
   anthropomorphic phantoms}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Positron emission tomography (PET) plays an important role in
   the diagnosis, staging, treatment, and surveillance of clinically
   localized diseases. Combined PET/CT imaging exhibits significantly
   higher sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy than conventional imaging
   when it comes to detecting malignant tumors in children. However, the
   radiation dose from positron-emitting radionuclide to the pediatric
   population is a matter of concern since children are at a particularly
   high risk when exposed to ionizing radiation.
   Methods: The authors evaluate the absorbed fractions and specific
   absorbed fractions (SAFs) of monoenergy photons/electrons as well as
   S-values of 9 positron-emitting radionuclides (C-11, N-13, O-15, F-18,
   Cu-64, Ga-68, Rb-82, Y-86, and I-124) in 48 source regions for 10
   anthropomorphic pediatric hybrid models, including the reference
   newborn, 1-, 5-, 10-, and 15-yr-old male and female models, using the
   Monte Carlo N-Particle eXtended general purpose Monte Carlo transport
   code.
   Results: The self-absorbed SAFs and S-values for most organs were
   inversely related to the age and body weight, whereas the cross-dose
   terms presented less correlation with body weight. For most
   source/target organ pairs, Rb-82 and Y-86 produce the highest
   self-absorbed and cross-absorbed S-values, respectively, while Cu-64
   produces the lowest S-values because of the low-energy and
   high-frequency of electron emissions. Most of the total self-absorbed
   S-values are contributed from non-penetrating particles (electrons and
   positrons), which have a linear relationship with body weight. The
   dependence of self-absorbed S-values of the two annihilation photons
   varies to the reciprocal of 0.76 power of the mass, whereas the
   self-absorbed S-values of positrons vary according to the reciprocal
   mass.
   Conclusions: The produced S-values for common positron-emitting
   radionuclides can be exploited for the assessment of radiation dose
   delivered to the pediatric population from various PET radiotracers used
   in clinical and research settings. The mass scaling method for
   positron-emitters can be used to derive patient-specific S-values from
   data of reference phantoms. (C) 2013 American Association of Physicists

Pages = {{1-8}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Information regarding climate variability might help peanut (Arachis
   hypogaea L.) growers optimize their management strategies under
   different climate scenarios and maximize their production. This study
   examined the impact of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on peanut
   yield for southeastern USA as influenced by soil type and planting date
   for two spatial levels - region and sub-region. Rainfed yields were
   simulated for 32 peanut growing counties in this region using the
   CSM-CROPGRO-Peanut model and the historical weather data of 50 years.
   The simulations were carried out for several scenarios comprising nine
   planting dates and seven soil types. Yields were separated by ENSO
   phase, and tests were performed for each planting date and soil type to
   examine if pod yields were different across the ENSO phases. Results
   showed that both planting date and soil type could significantly
   influence the effect of ENSO on peanut yield. The yield differences
   among ENSO phases were minimal for the peanuts planted during the middle
   part of the planting window (May 8 through May 22). The differences,
   however, were substantial for the planting dates in the initial and
   terminal parts of the window (April 16 through May 1 and May 29 through
   June 12). The influence of soil type on the ENSO effect was significant
   only for soils with the water holding capacity of less than 0.1 and for
   crops planted during the initial and terminal parts of the planting
   window. The ENSO effect was weaker and spatially less consistent at
   sub-regional level, but strong at the regional level. (c) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{For production planning problems, cost parameters can be uncertain due

   the total expected cost for a finite horizon problem. We develop an
   extended linear programming formulation in a higher dimensional space
   that can provide integral solutions by showing that its constraint
   matrix is totally unimodular. We also project this extended formulation
   to a lower dimensional space and obtain a corresponding extended
   formulation in the lower dimensional space. Final computational
   experiments demonstrate that the extended formulation is more efficient

Abstract = {{A two-axis scanning microelectromechanical (MEMS) mirror enables an
   optical coherence tomography (OCT) system to perform three-dimensional
   endoscopic imaging due to its fast scan speed and small size. However,
   the radial scan from the MEMS mirror causes various distortions in OCT
   images, namely spherical, fan-shaped and keystone distortions. In this
   paper, a new method is proposed to correct all of three distortions
   presented in OCT systems based on two-axis MEMS scanning mirrors. The
   spherical distortion is corrected first by directly manipulating the
   original spectral interferograms in the phase domain, followed by
   Fourier transform and three-dimensional geometrical transformation for
   correcting the other two types of distortions. OCT imaging experiments
   on a paper with square ink printed arrays and a glass tube filled with
   milk have been used to validate the proposed method. Distortions in OCT
   images of flat or curved surfaces can all be effectively removed. (c)

Abstract = {{A systematic experiment was performed in an effort to investigate how
   the levels of certain test parameters affect the values of elastic
   modulus, hardness, yield stress, and strain hardening constant obtained
   using nanoindentation test. Maximum applied load, loading (unloading)
   rate, and hold time at maximum load were varied at three levels. The
   effects of these testing parameters were investigated through a
   three-level, full factorial design of experiment. The experiments were
   conducted on ultrafine Al-Mg specimens that were mechanically extruded.
   Both longitudinal and transverse extrusion directions were examined to
   investigate effects of anisotropy on mechanical properties and evaluate
   the persistence of observed variations due to test parameters on
   different materials orientations. An indentation size effect (ISE) was
   observed demonstrating that maximum load-and thereby maximum indentation
   depth-can have a significant effect on values of hardness and elastic
   modulus. Hardness values decreased with higher loading rates, and higher
   rates of unloading resulted in higher values of elastic modulus (5-10
   GPa increases). Strain-hardening exponent showed a decreasing trend with
   increasing loading rate while yield stress exhibited a consistent
   correlation to hardness across all studied parameters. The material
   exhibited very little creep during the hold period, and values of the
   calculated properties were not significantly altered by varying the
   length of the hold time. Anisotropy effect was observed, particularly in
   the values of yield strength. This is attributed to the preferred grain
   orientation due to extrusion.}},

Abstract = {{We report a 1.5-mm NMR probe based on high temperature superconductors
   operating at 14.1 T optimized for C-13 detection. The probe has a total
   sample volume of about 35 microliters (mu L) with an active volume of 20
   mu L and provides exceptional mass sensitivity for C-13 detection. The
   probe also has excellent H-1 sensitivity and employs a H-2 lock; N-15
   irradiation capability can be added in the future. The coils are cooled
   to about 20 K using a standard Agilent cryogenic refrigeration system,
   and the sample temperature is regulated near room temperature. The coil
   design considerations are discussed in detail. This probe is ideal for
   directly detected C-13 NMR experiments for natural products chemistry
   and metabolomics applications, for which 35 mu L is an optimal sample
   volume. The outstanding C-13 sensitivity of this probe allowed us to
   directly determine the C-13 connectivity on 1.1 mg of natural abundance
   histidine using an INADEQUATE experiment. We demonstrated the utility of
   this probe for C-13-based metabolomics using a synthetic mixture of
   common natural abundance metabolites whose concentrations ranged from 1
   to 5 mM (40-200 nmol). (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Technological advancements in the silicon industry, as predicted by
   Moore's law, have resulted in an increasing number of processor cores on
   a single chip, giving rise to multicore, and subsequently many-core
   architectures. This work focuses on identifying key architecture and
   software optimizations to attain high performance from tiled many-core
   architectures (TMAs)-an architectural innovation in the multicore
   technology. Although embedded systems design is traditionally
   power-centric, there has been a recent shift toward high-performance
   embedded computing due to the proliferation of compute-intensive
   embedded applications. The TMAs are suitable for these embedded
   applications due to low-power design features in many of these TMAs. We
   discuss the performance optimizations on a single tile (processor core)
   as well as parallel performance optimizations, such as application
   decomposition, cache locality, tile locality, memory balancing, and
   horizontal communication for TMAs. We elaborate compiler-based
   optimizations that are applicable to TMAs, such as function inlining,
   loop unrolling, and feedback-based optimizations. We present a case
   study with optimized dense matrix multiplication algorithms for Tilera's
   TILEPro64 to experimentally demonstrate the performance and performance
   per watt optimizations on TMAs. Our results quantify the effectiveness
   of algorithmic choices, cache blocking, compiler optimizations, and
   horizontal communication in attaining high performance and performance
   per watt on TMAs.}},

Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{2465-2480}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The feedback particle filter introduced in this paper is a new approach
   to approximate nonlinear filtering, motivated by techniques from
   mean-field game theory. The filter is defined by an ensemble of
   controlled stochastic systems (the particles). Each particle evolves
   under feedback control based on its own state, and features of the
   empirical distribution of the ensemble. The feedback control law is
   obtained as the solution to an optimal control problem, in which the
   optimization criterion is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the
   actual posterior, and the common posterior of any particle. The
   following conclusions are obtained for diffusions with continuous
   observations: 1) The optimal control solution is exact: The two
   posteriors match exactly, provided they are initialized with identical
   priors. 2) The optimal filter admits an innovation error-based gain
   feedback structure. 3) The optimal feedback gain is obtained via a
   solution of an Euler-Lagrange boundary value problem; the feedback gain
   equals the Kalman gain in the linear Gaussian case. Numerical algorithms
   are introduced and implemented in two general examples, and a
   neuroscience application involving coupled oscillators. In some cases it
   is found that the filter exhibits significantly lower variance when
   compared to the bootstrap particle filter.}},

Abstract = {{We examine different sampling lattices and their respective bandlimited

   the non-tensor-product bandlimited approximations corresponding to the
   body-centered cubic and face-centered cubic lattices provide a more
   accurate reconstruction than the tensor-product bandlimited
   approximation associated with the commonly-used Cartesian lattice. Our
   practical algorithm uses multidimensional sinc functions that are
   tailored to these lattices and a regularization scheme that provides a
   variational framework for efficient implementation. Using a number of
   synthetic and real data sets we record improvements in the accuracy of
   reconstruction in a practical setting.}},

Abstract = {{The distributed beamforming problem for amplify-and-forward relay

   distributed beamforming can be considered as a generalized eigenvector

   derived with a standard closed-form solution. In this paper, four
   classes of beamforming algorithms are derived based on different design
   criteria and constraints, including maximizing output SNR subject to a
   constraint on the total transmitted signal power, minimizing the total
   transmitted signal power subject to certain level of output SNR,
   minimizing the relay node number subject to constraints on the total
   signal power and output SNR, and a robust algorithm to deal with channel
   estimation errors. All of the algorithms have a low computational
   complexity due to the proposed real-valued implementation.}},

Abstract = {{To relate changes in the electrochemical impedance spectra to the
   progression and mechanism of skin damage arising from exposure to
   dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).
   Electrochemical impedance spectra measured before and after human
   cadaver skin was treated with neat DMSO or phosphate buffered saline
   (control) for 1 h or less were compared with electrical circuit models
   representing two contrasting theories describing the progression of DMSO
   damage. Flux of a model lipophilic compound (p-chloronitrobenzene) was
   also measured.
   The impedance spectra collected before and after 1 h treatment with DMSO
   were consistent with a single circuit model; whereas, the spectra
   collected after DMSO exposure for 0.25 h were consistent with the model
   circuits observed before and after DMSO treatment for 1 h combined in
   series. DMSO treatments did not significantly change the flux of
   p-chloronitrobenzene compared to control.
   Impedance measurements of human skin exposed to DMSO for less than about
   0.5 h were consistent with the presence of two layers: one damaged
   irreversibly and one unchanged. The thickness of the damaged layer
   increased proportional to the square-root of treatment time until about
   0.5 h, when DMSO affected the entire stratum corneum. Irreversible DMSO
   damage altered the lipophilic permeation pathway minimally.}},

Abstract = {{The acoustic and thermal properties as well as the temperature change

   Described in this article is a tomographic reconstruction method used to
   determine the tissue properties and increase in temperature in a 3-D
   volume. On the basis of the iterative finite-element solution to the
   bioheat equation coupled with Tikhonov regularization techniques, our
   reconstruction algorithm solves the inverse problem of bioheat transfer
   and uses the time-dependent temperature measured on a tissue surface to
   obtain the acoustic absorption coefficient, thermal diffusivity and
   temperature increase within the subsurface volume. Numerical simulations
   were performed to validate the reconstruction algorithm. The method was
   initially conducted in ex vivo experiments in which time-dependent
   temperature on a tissue surface was measured using high-resolution,
   non-invasive infrared thermography. (E-mail: hjiang@bme.ufl.edu and

Title = {{Protocol for Relative Hydrodynamic Assessment of Tri-leaflet Polymer
   Valves}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{80}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Limitations of currently available prosthetic valves, xenografts, and
   homografts have prompted a recent resurgence of developments in the area
   of tri-leaflet polymer valve prostheses. However, identification of a
   protocol for initial assessment of polymer valve hydrodynamic
   functionality is paramount during the early stages of the design
   process. Traditional in vitro pulse duplicator systems are not
   configured to accommodate flexible tri-leaflet materials; in addition,
   assessment of polymer valve functionality needs to be made in a relative
   context to native and prosthetic heart valves under identical test
   conditions so that variability in measurements from different
   instruments can be avoided. Accordingly, we conducted hydrodynamic
   assessment of i) native (n = 4, mean diameter, D = 20 mm), ii)
   bi-leaflet mechanical (n= 2, D = 23 mm) and iii) polymer valves (n = 5,
   D = 22 mm) via the use of a commercially available pulse duplicator
   system (ViVitro Labs Inc, Victoria, BC) that was modified to accommodate
   tri-leaflet valve geometries. Tri-leaflet silicone valves developed at
   the University of Florida comprised the polymer valve group. A mixture
   in the ratio of 35: 65 glycerin to water was used to mimic blood
   physical properties. Instantaneous flow rate was measured at the
   interface of the left ventricle and aortic units while pressure was
   recorded at the ventricular and aortic positions. Bi-leaflet and native
   valve data from the literature was used to validate flow and pressure
   readings. The following hydrodynamic metrics were reported: forward flow
   pressure drop, aortic root mean square forward flow rate, aortic
   closing, leakage and regurgitant volume, transaortic closing, leakage,
   and total energy losses. Representative results indicated that
   hydrodynamic metrics from the three valve groups could be successfully
   obtained by incorporating a custom-built assembly into a commercially
   available pulse duplicator system and subsequently, objectively compared
   to provide insights on functional aspects of polymer valve design.}},

Abstract = {{Surfactant loaded polymeric hydrogels find applications in several
   technological areas including drug delivery. Drug transport can be
   attenuated in surfactant loaded gels through partitioning of the drug in
   the surfactant aggregates. The drug transport depends on the type of the
   aggregates and also on the surfactant transport because diffusion of the
   surfactant leads to dissolution of the aggregates. The drug and the
   surfactant transport can be characterized by the surfactant monomer
   diffusivity D-s. and the critical aggregation concentration C{*}. Here
   we focus on the transport in hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) hydrogels
   loaded with three different types of Brij surfactants. We measure
   transport of a hydrophobic drug cyclosporine and the surfactant for
   surfactant loadings ranging from 0.1\% to 8\%, and utilize the data to
   predict the values of D-s. and C{*}. We show that the predictions based
   on surfactant transport are significantly different from those based on
   modeling the drug transport. The differences are attributed to the
   assumption of just one type of aggregate in the gel irrespective of the
   total concentration. The transport data suggests existence of multiple
   types of aggregates and this hypothesis is validated for Brij 98 by
   imaging of the microstructure with free fracture SEM. (c) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In high mobility areas such as shopping malls and transportation
   stations, mobile users tend to move in and out in a bursty fashion, and
   hence location update (LU) and paging signaling cause substantial
   traffic burden to the cellular networks, leading to signaling
   congestion. This poses a great challenge to the system design for
   wireless cellular systems. Traditional cellular systems cannot cope with
   this situation very well. However, with the ad hoc operational mode
   recently introduced into the cellular systems, the added multi-hop
   relaying via mobile devices provides a new way to mitigate location
   management traffic. In this paper, based on this new architecture, we
   propose a novel scheme, called aggregative location management, which
   aggregates multiple location updates into group location updates. For
   the scenarios of high capacity transit (HCT) systems, we use this
   grouping scheme to alleviate the signaling traffic when mobile users in
   an HCT move into new location areas. For other scenarios with mass
   arrivals of LU requests, we develop a generic aggregative location
   management scheme in which LU requests can be first aggregated by
   designated mobile devices and then are periodically sent to the location
   registers. Performance evaluation is carried out and shows their
   significant effectiveness.}},

   distributed execution and the overhead of message passing is low. It is
   also possible to embed the algorithm into a network protocol so that the
   sensor nodes and the sink can run it directly as part of the network
   operation. We give a proof of the algorithm's optimality and the
   boundedness of the queue sizes, both in the long-run average sense. The
   proof is based on analyzing a Lyapunov drift.}},

Abstract = {{The strong coupling between hydrodynamics and seafloors on shallow muddy
   shelves, and resulting bed reworking, have been extensively documented.
   On these shelves, spectral wave transformation is driven by a complex
   combination of forcing mechanisms that include nonlinear wave
   interactions and wave energy dissipation induced by fluid-mud at a range
   of frequencies. Wave-mud interaction is investigated herein by using a
   previously validated nonlinear spectral wave model and observations of
   waves and near-bed conditions on a mildly-sloping seafloor off the muddy
   central chenier-plain coast, western Louisiana Shelf, United States.
   Measurements were made along a cross-shelf transect spanning 1 km
   between 4 and 3 m water depths. The high-resolution observations of
   waves and near-bed conditions suggest presence of a fluid mud layer with
   thickness sometimes exceeding 10 cm under strong long wave action (1
   meter wave height with 7 s peak period at 4 meter depth). Spectral wave
   transformation is modeled using the stochastic formulation of the
   nonlinear Mild Slope Equation, modified to account for wave-breaking and
   mud-induced dissipation. The model is used in an inverse manner in order
   to estimate the viscosity of the fluid mud layer, which is a key
   parameter controlling mud-induced wave dissipation but complicated to
   measure in the field during major wave events. Estimated kinematic
   viscosities vary between 10(-4)-10(-3) m(2)/s. Combining these results
   of the wave model simulations with in-depth analysis of near-bed
   conditions and boundary layer modeling allows for a detailed
   investigation of the interaction of nonlinear wave propagation and mud
   characteristics. The results indicate that mud-induced dissipation is
   most efficient when the wave-induced resuspensions of concentrations >
   10 g/L settle due to relatively small bottom stresses to form a fluid
   mud layer that is not as thin and viscous as a consolidated seafloor in
   absence of wave action but also not as thick and soft as a near-bed high
   concentration layer that forms during strong wave action. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{We analyzed the microbial community that developed after 4 years of
   testing different soil-crop management systems in the savannah forest
   transition zone of Eastern Ghana where management systems can rapidly
   alter stored soil carbon as well as soil fertility. The agricultural
   managements were: (i) the local practice of fallow regrowth of native
   elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum) followed by biomass burning before
   planting maize in the spring, (ii) the same practice but without burning
   and the maize receiving mineral nitrogen fertilizer, (iii) a winter crop
   of a legume, pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), followed by maize, (iv)
   vegetation free winter period (bare fallow) followed by maize, and (v)
   unmanaged elephant grass-shrub vegetation. The mean soil organic carbon
   (SOC) contents of the soils after 4 years were: 1.29, 1.67, 1.54, 0.80
   and 1.34\%, respectively, differences that should affect resources for
   the microbial community.
   From about 290,000 sequences obtained by pyrosequencing the SSU rRNA
   gene, canonical correspondence analysis showed that SOC was the most
   important factor that explained differences in microbial community
   structure among treatments. This analysis as well as phylogenetic
   ecological network construction indicated that members of the
   Acidobacteria GP4 and GP6 were more abundant in soils with relatively
   high SOC whereas Acidobacteria GP1, GP7, and Actinobacteria were more
   prevalent in soil with lower SOC. Burning of winter fallow vegetation
   led to an increase in Bacillales, especially those belonging to
   spore-forming genera. Of the managements, pigeon-pea cultivation during
   the winter period promoted a higher microbial diversity and also
   sequestered more SOC, presumably improving soil structure, fertility,
   and resiliency. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The controlled deposition of a catalytically active material on a
   support, resulting in defined particle sizes and shapes, as well as
   control over the specific surface area of the active material and the
   support are usually limited when applying conventional catalyst
   preparation techniques. Flame spray pyrolysis offers the potential to
   overcome this limitation and is tested for the preparation of
   Fischer-Tropsch catalysts. Conventional single flame spray pyrolysis
   and, for the first time, double flame spray pyrolysis are compared for
   the synthesis of alumina supported cobalt catalysts. In the latter
   process the metal oxide precursors are combusted individually in two
   opposing nozzles. The key parameter for defining the final material
   composition is the intersection distance of the flames, which was
   systematically varied. The Fischer-Tropsch performance of the Co-based
   catalysts was studied in a fixed bed reactor at 230 degrees C and 20
   bar. The catalytic results are discussed on the basis of structural
   characterization of the different catalysts by XRD, BET, TPR, UV-vis and
   TEM/EF-TEM. While catalysts made by single flame spray pyrolysis Were
   inactive in the Fischer-Tropsch reaction regardless of whether cobalt
   was subsequently mixed with alumina or the supported catalyst was
   directly prepared in the flame reactor, the double flame sprayed
   catalysts showed good catalytic activity. Depending on the intersection
   distance of the two flames, the formation of cobalt oxide and alumina
   occurred separately in each flame reactor. In spite of the independent
   particle growth in the two flames, the double flame reactor geometry
   lead to good adhesion of the two oxides resulting in good stabilization
   of cobalt nanoparticles on the alumina support during the
   Fischer-Tropsch reaction. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Predicting hydrophobicity is very important in manufacturing products
   with self-cleaning properties. This study focuses on the effect of
   graphite surfaces with pillars of different surface fractions and
   heights on the contact angles of a nano-sized water droplet. This study
   used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the hydrophobic
   properties of water droplets on the nano-scale. The contact angles were
   calculated and averaged over time for each case. Results showed the
   droplets in either the Wenzel state or the Cassie state. In general, as
   the pillar height increases the static contact angle increases to a
   certain point when the pillar height no longer has a significant effect
   on the contact angle. Over all, the smaller the pillar surface fraction
   the larger the change in the contact angle as the pillar height
   increased. As pillar surface fractions decreased from 36\%, simulated
   contact angles undershot Cassie predictions at increasing amounts due to
   part of the water droplet sagging below the pillar tops. Graphite
   displayed anisotropic characteristics due to its layered structure which
   caused the contact angles to increase as surface roughness increased
   even though its Young contact angle was less than 90 degrees. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Ferroelectric and ferroelastic domains can be reoriented during the
   application of electric field through domain wall motion. This study
   develops a method to quantify the domain reorientation in perovskite
   ferroelectrics with orthorhombic crystal lattices. In situ, high-energy
   X-ray diffraction was utilized to obtain intensity ratios that are
   necessary for the calculation. Domain reorientation in orthorhombic
   Li-doped Na0.5K0.5NbO3 is then quantified using this method. The
   preference of domain orientations is explained by considering the angle
   between spontaneous polarization of the respective domains and the
   applied electric field direction. The extent of domain reorientation
   increases as the Li substitution increases which additionally correlates
   to increased piezoelectric coefficient d (33) and field-induced strain.
   Increased domain wall motion is further proposed to originate due to the
   increased compositional proximity to the morphotropic phase boundary, a
   proposed universal behavior in ferroelectric compositions-containing
   phase boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{Mixed-mode fracture surfaces of an R-curve material were quantitatively
   assessed using fractography. The R-curve material chosen was a mica
   glass ceramic. Vickers indentation cracks of different sizes were
   introduced at the center of tensile surface of glass ceramic bars
   fractured in flexure. The bars were fractured in flexure by generating
   mixed-mode (I/II) loading conditions at crack tips by orienting
   indentation cracks at various angles with respect to the tensile axis.
   Quantitative fractography indicated that crack-to-mirror size ratios
   were a function of crack length and mode mixity. Stress intensity at
   branching for the mirror-hackle transition during mixed-mode (I/II)
   fracture condition was a constant and was less than the corresponding
   stress intensity at branching in mode I loading. An empirical
   relationship is derived for the effective geometric factors in

Abstract = {{The open-circuit voltage (V (OC)) in organic photovoltaic cells has been
   shown to depend on a number of parameters including the energy levels of
   the active materials, active layer structure, illumination intensity,
   and operating temperature. Here we report, a significant increase in V
   (OC) from 0.43 to 0.63 V in zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc)/C-60 planar
   heterojunction photovoltaic cells operated at room temperature under 1
   sun AM1.5G solar illumination, when a home-synthesized and purified ZnPc
   source materials was used instead of a commercially obtained (and home
   purified) ZnPc source. While the two ZnPc source materials have nearly
   identical UV-Vis and IR absorption properties, the home-synthesized ZnPc
   contains chlorinated derivatives and has half of the electrical defect
   density (on the order of 10(16) cm(-3)) as compared to the commercial
   ZnPc. The improved V (OC) in devices with the home-synthesized ZnPc is
   contributed from both a lower dark current and a higher magnitude of
   photocurrent. Additional experiments revealed that the different device
   characteristics are mostly associated with processes occurring at the
   ZnPc/C-60 interface, which we attribute to nongeminate recombination of
   charges built-up on either side of the interface.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the important role of microstructure on nuclear fuel performance,
   it is desirable to obtain improved control of fuel microstructure. For
   example, Cr2O3 has been used as a grain growth promoter during the
   sintering of UO2; however, the influence of Cr incorporation on the
   bonding within the grain boundary is not well understood. Here, we
   quantify the energetics associated with Cr incorporation and segregation
   in a model UO2 system with a Sigma 5 symmetric tilt grain boundary using
   density functional theory calculations. The results indicate that Cr
   prefers to reside in a U substitutional site and segregate to the grain
   boundary. The Bader charge analysis and the charge density difference
   analyses confirm that Cr forms bonds with neighboring O atoms that
   weaken the ionic nature of adjacent U-O bonds, especially when it
   occupies U substitutional site at the grain boundary. The implications
   of these findings for the usage of Cr2O3 as a growth promoter are
   discussed. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article considers the problem of maximizing the lifetime of a
   wireless sensor network with a mobile sink. The sink travels at finite
   speed among a subset of possible sink locations to collect data from a
   stationary set of sensor nodes. The considered problem chooses a subset
   of sink locations for the sink to visit, finds a tour for the sink among
   the selected sink locations, and prescribes an optimal data routing
   scheme from the sensor nodes to each location visited by the sink. The
   sink's tour is constrained by the time it spends at each location
   collecting data. Two variations of this problem are examined based on
   assumptions regarding delay tolerance. Exact mixed-integer programming
   formulations to model this problem are provided along with cutting
   planes, preprocessing techniques, and a Benders decomposition algorithm
   to improve its solvability. Computational results demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed methods.}},

Title = {{Spatio-temporal Granger causality: A new framework}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{241-263}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{That physiological oscillations of various frequencies are present in
   fMRI signals is the rule, not the exception. Herein, we propose a novel
   theoretical framework, spatio-temporal Granger causality, which allows
   us to more reliably and precisely estimate the Granger causality from
   experimental datasets possessing time-varying properties caused by
   physiological oscillations. Within this framework, Granger causality is
   redefined as a global index measuring the directed information flow
   between two time series with time-varying properties. Both theoretical
   analyses and numerical examples demonstrate that Granger causality is a
   monotonically increasing function of the temporal resolution used in the
   estimation. This is consistent with the general principle of coarse
   graining, which causes information loss by smoothing out very fine-scale
   details in time and space. Our results confirm that the Granger
   causality at the finer spatio-temporal scales considerably outperforms
   the traditional approach in terms of an improved consistency between two
   resting-state scans of the same subject. To optimally estimate the
   Granger causality, the proposed theoretical framework is implemented
   through a combination of several approaches, such as dividing the
   optimal time window and estimating the parameters at the fine temporal
   and spatial scales. Taken together, our approach provides a novel and
   robust framework for estimating the Granger causality from fMRI, EEG,
   and other related data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Swarm-NG: A CUDA library for Parallel n-body Integrations with focus on

Journal = {{NEW ASTRONOMY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{23-24}},
Pages = {{6-18}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{We present Swarm-NG, a C++ library for the efficient direct integration
   of many n-body systems using a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), such as
   NVIDIA's Tesla T10 and M2070 GPUs. While previous studies have
   demonstrated the benefit of GPUs for n-body simulations with thousands
   to millions of bodies, Swarm-NG focuses on many few-body systems, e.g.,
   thousands of systems with 3...15 bodies each, as is typical for the
   study of planetary systems. Swarm-NG parallelizes the simulation,
   including both the numerical integration of the equations of motion and
   the evaluation of forces using NVIDIA's ``Compute Unified Device
   Architecture{''} (CUDA) on the GPU. Swarm-NG includes optimized
   implementations of 4th order time-symmetrized Hermite integration and
   mixed variable symplectic integration, as well as several sample codes
   for other algorithms to illustrate how non-CUDA-savvy users may
   themselves introduce customized integrators into the Swarm-NG framework.
   To optimize performance, we analyze the effect of GPU-specific
   parameters on performance under double precision. For an ensemble of
   131072 planetary systems, each containing three bodies, the NVIDIA Tesla
   M2070 GPU outperforms a 6-core Intel Xeon X5675 CPU by a factor of
   similar to 2.75. Thus, we conclude that modern GPUs offer an attractive
   alternative to a cluster of CPUs for the integration of an ensemble of
   many few-body systems.
   Applications of Swarm-NG include studying the late stages of planet
   formation, testing the stability of planetary systems and evaluating the
   goodness-of-fit between many planetary system models and observations of
   extrasolar planet host stars (e.g., radial velocity, astrometry, transit
   timing). While Swarm-NG focuses on the parallel integration of many
   planetary systems, the underlying integrators could be applied to a wide
   variety of problems that require repeatedly integrating a set of
   ordinary differential equations many times using different initial
   conditions and/or parameter values. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{A discrete element method model is used to examine the velocity, solid
   fraction, and particle orientation Fields of non-cohesive,
   sphero-cylindrical particles agitated in a vertical axis mixer for a
   range of particle aspect ratios and bed depths. The model is validated
   against experimental measurements of the rotating shaft torque. The
   particle trajectories within the bed are similar to those that have been
   reported previously for spheres, with a vortex circulating in the
   direction opposite of the blade rotation on horizontal planes of the
   bed. Increasing the particle aspect ratio generally decreases the
   particle velocities relative to the blade, implying reduced mixing. The
   solid fraction is largest just upstream of the blades and toward the
   base of the container for sphero-cylindrical particles. The smallest
   solid fractions are located in the wake region and at the bed's free
   surface. These results are generally consistent with those for spherical
   particles, although for spheres the solid fraction is smaller upstream
   of the blades near the container base. In general, larger particle
   aspect ratios decrease the overall bed solid fraction as well as the
   solid fraction uniformity. Particles with an aspect ratio larger than
   one have major axes that are offset between 10 and 20 from the flow
   streamlines. The degree of alignment between particles increases near
   boundary regions. In addition to the strong correlation between the
   particle principal orientation and velocity vectors, regions of larger
   velocity gradient magnitude result in smaller solid fractions and
   smaller degrees of three-dimensional alignment between particles. (C)

   subjects: RBD, PD-FOG, PD+FOG, and controls. Tonic and phasic muscle
   activity during REM sleep were quantified using EMG recordings from the
   chin, compared among study groups, and correlated with disease metrics.
   Results: There were no significant differences in measures of disease
   severity, duration, or dopaminergic medications between the PD+FOG and
   PD-FOG groups. Tonic muscle activity was increased significantly (p <
   0.007) in the RBD and PD+FOG groups compared to the PD-FOG and control
   groups. There was no significant difference in tonic EMG between the
   PD+FOG and RBD group (p = 0.364), or in tonic or phasic EMG between the
   PD-FOG and control group (p = 0.107). Phasic muscle activity was
   significantly increased in the RBD group compared to all other groups (p
   = 0.029) and between the PD+FOG and control group (p = 0.001), but not
   between the PD+FOG and PD-FOG groups (p = 0.059).
   Conclusions: These findings provide evidence that increased muscle
   activity during REM sleep is a comorbid feature of patients with PD who
   exhibit FOG as a motor manifestation of their disease.}},

Abstract = {{Although use of automobile air conditioning (AC) was shown to reduce
   in-vehicle particle levels, the characterization of its microbial
   aerosol exposure risks is. lacking. Here, both AC and engine filter dust
   samples were collected from 30 automobiles in four different
   geographical, locations in China. Biological contents (bacteria, fungi,
   and endotoxin) were studied using culturing, high-throughput gene
   sequence, and Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) methods. In-vehicle viable
   bioaerosol concentrations were directly monitored using an ultraviolet
   aerodynamic particle sizer (UVAPS) before and after use of AC for 5, 10,
   and 15 min. Regardless of locations, the vehicle AC filter dusts were
   found to be laden with high levels of bacteria (up to 26 150 CFU/mg),
   fungi (up to 1287 CFU/mg), and endotoxin (up to 5527 EU/mg). More than
   400 unique bacterial species, including human opportunistic pathogens,
   were detected in the filter dusts. In addition, allergenic fungal
   species were also found abundant. Surprisingly, unexpected fluorescent
   peaks around 2.5 mu m were observed during the first 5 min use of AC,
   which was attributed to the reaerosolization of those filter-borne
   microbial agents. The information obtained here can assist in minimizing
   or preventing the respiratory allergy or infection risk from the use of
   automobile AC system.}},

Abstract = {{Using a high speed optical imaging system operated at a time resolution
   of either 10ns or 100ns, we have documented the initiation process of 14
   return strokes in four rocket-triggered lightning flashes. Of the 14
   strokes, nine occurred following dart leaders and five following
   dart-stepped leaders. The return strokes are found to initiate at
   heights ranging from 7.21.4 to 21.04.6m above the lightning termination
   point. Return strokes with larger peak current tend to initiate higher.
   All the return strokes show initial bidirectional (upward and downward
   from their initiation height) propagation. We have been able to estimate
   the initial upward propagation speeds below 60m for all of the return
   strokes. The resultant speeds range from 0.4x10(8) to 2.5x10(8)m/s. For
   the downward propagation speeds, only six strokes among the 14 strokes
   allow us to perform a reasonable estimation. Those downward speeds range
   from 0.6x10(8) to 1.9x10(8)m/s.}},

Abstract = {{We present ground-level electric field intensity and trigger-wire-base
   current measurements in Florida during 33 successful rocket-and-wire
   triggered lightning attempts, those which initiated a sustained upward
   leader, and 20 unsuccessful attempts. The electric field changes during
   wire ascent were measured at eight stations between 35m and 208m from
   the launch site while the electric fields produced by precursor
   discharges at the ascending wire tip were measured at 120m and 220m.
   Both relatively steady trigger wire currents in the milliampere-range
   and fast precursor currents in the ampere to hundred-ampere range were
   measured at the wire base. A total of 2196 individual precursors were
   measured in 45 launches with negative charge overhead, with 0 to 225
   precursors per launch and each precursor depositing 1 mu C to 157 mu C
   of charge at the wire tip. With negative charge overhead, slowly varying
   currents measured during the wire ascent increased to a maximum value
   between 3mA and 10mA. Positive line charge densities on the trigger wire
   were inferred from both the wire-base current and the ground-level
   electric field reduction during wire ascent for 38 launches, ranging
   from 1 mu C m(-1) near ground to about 100 mu C m(-1) at 200m to 300m
   aloft. A comparison of successful launches and unsuccessful launches
   with negative charge overhead shows that successful launches tend to
   have larger trigger wire line charge densities and larger precursor
   charge magnitudes, implying larger electric fields aloft. Three
   unsuccessful triggering attempts were made with positive charge
   overhead.}},

Abstract = {{There is increasing interest in recovering phosphorus (P) from various
   wastewater streams for beneficial use as fertilizer and to minimize
   environmental impacts of excess P on receiving waters. One such example
   is P recovery from human urine, which has a high concentration of
   phosphate (200-800 mg P/L) and accounts for a small volume (similar to
   1\%) of total wastewater flow. Accordingly, the goal of this study was
   to evaluate the potential to recover P from source-separated and
   combined wastewater streams that included undiluted human urine, urine
   diluted with tap water, greywater, mixture of urine and greywater,
   anaerobic digester supernatant, and secondary wastewater effluent. A
   hybrid anion exchange (HAIX) resin containing hydrous ferric oxide was
   used to recover P because of its selectivity for phosphate and the
   option to precipitate P minerals in the waste regeneration solution. The
   P recovery potential was fresh urine > hydrolyzed urine > greywater >
   biological wastewater effluent > anaerobic digester supernatant. The
   maximum loading of P on HAIX resin was fresh urine > hydrolyzed urine >
   anaerobic digester supernatant approximate to greywater > biological
   wastewater effluent. Results indicated that the sorption capacity of
   HAIX resin for phosphate and the total P recovery potential were greater
   for source-separated urine than the combined wastewater streams of
   secondary wastewater effluent and anaerobic digester supernatant.
   Dilution of urine with tap water decreased the phosphate loading on HAIX
   resin. The results of this work advance the current understanding of
   nutrient recovery from complex wastewater streams by sorption processes.

Abstract = {{Advances in calcium imaging have enabled studies of the dynamic activity
   of both individual neurons and neuronal assemblies. However, challenges,
   such as unknown nonlinearities in the spike-calcium relationship, noise,
   and the often relatively low temporal resolution of the calcium signal
   compared to the time-scale of spike generation, restrict the accurate
   estimation of action potentials from the calcium signal. Complex
   neuronal discharge, such as the activity demonstrated by bursting and
   rhythmically active neurons, represents an even greater challenge for
   reconstructing spike trains based on calcium signals. We propose a
   method using blind calcium signal deconvolution based on an
   information-theoretic approach. This model is meant to maximise the
   output entropy of a nonlinear filter where the nonlinearity is defined
   by the cumulative distribution function of the spike signal. We tested
   our maximum entropy (ME) algorithm using bursting olfactory receptor
   neurons (bORNs) of the lobster olfactory organ. The advantage of the ME
   algorithm is that the filter can be trained online based only on the
   statistics of the spike signal, without any assumptions regarding the
   unknown transfer function characterizing the relation between the spike
   and calcium signal. We show that the ME method is able to more
   accurately reconstruct the timing of the first and last spikes of a
   burst compared to other methods and that it improves the temporal
   precision fivefold compared to direct timing resolution of calcium
   signal. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews results of our recent studies of diffusion of gaseous
   sorbates in nanotube systems. C-13 pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR at
   17.6 T was used to probe diffusion of tetrafluoromethane in
   aluminosilicate nanotubes at several sorbate loadings. The results of
   PFG NMR measurements were compared with the corresponding data obtained
   by molecular dynamics simulations. The diffusion in this system was
   found to follow the laws of normal (i.e. Fickian) transport. At the same
   time, experimental data pointing at single-file diffusion were recorded
   for xenon gas confined inside dipeptide L-alanyl L-valine (AV)
   nanotubes. These data were obtained by means of high field Xe-129 PFG
   NMR. The PFG NMR data are compared with recently reported hyperpolarized
   tracer exchange Xe-129 NMR in the same material. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

   index in the transparency range is evidenced. The extracted physical

Title = {{Pathways and kinetics of methane and ethane C-H bond cleavage on
   PdO(101)}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{139}},

Abstract = {{We used conventional density functional theory (DFT) and
   dispersion-corrected DFT (DFT-D3) calculations to investigate C-H bond
   activation pathways for methane and ethane sigma-complexes adsorbed on
   the PdO(101) surface. The DFT-D3 calculations predict lower and more
   physically realistic values of the apparent C-H bond cleavage barriers,
   which are defined relative to the gas-phase energy level, while giving
   nearly the same energy differences between stationary states as
   predicted by conventional DFT for a given reaction pathway. For the
   stable CH4 eta(2) complex on PdO(101), DFT-D3 predicts that the C-H bond
   cleavage barriers are 55.2 and 16.1 kJ/mol relative to the initial
   molecularly adsorbed and gaseous states, respectively. We also predict
   that dehydrogenation of the resulting CH3 groups and conversion to CH3O
   species are significantly more energetically demanding than the initial
   C-H bond activation of CH4 on PdO(101). Using DFT-D3, we find that an
   eta(2) and an eta(1) ethane complex can undergo C-H bond cleavage on
   PdO(101) with intrinsic energy barriers that are similar to that of the
   methane complex, but with apparent barriers that are close to zero. We
   also investigated the dissociation kinetics of methane and ethane on
   PdO(101) using microkinetic models, with parameters derived from the
   DFT-D3 relaxed structures. We find that a so-called 3N - 2 model, in
   which two frustrated adsorbate motions are treated as free motions,
   predicts desorption pre-factors and alkane dissociation probabilities
   that agree well with estimates obtained from the literature. The
   microkinetic simulations demonstrate the importance of accurately
   describing entropic contributions in kinetic simulations of alkane
   dissociative chemisorption. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The morphology and electronic structure of Cu and Au clusters deposited
   via thermal evaporation onto ZnO(10 (1) over bar0) substrates have been
   studied via scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS). The initial stages of nucleation and growth (similar
   to 0.2 ML) of both Cu and Au are compared with density functional theory
   (DFT) calculations, which show an excellent agreement with the cluster
   morphologies observed by STM, with Cu nucleating three-dimensional (3D)
   islands even at small coverage while Au nucleates single-layer islands
   that grow layer by layer. DFT also gives insight into the diffusion
   behavior of Cu and Au adatoms on the ZnO substrate, showing strongly
   anisotropic diffusion barriers for Cu atoms which results in the
   experimentally observed preferential cluster nucleation along {[}0001]
   step edges, whereas Au shows no such anisotropy and Au clusters are
   observed to have no preferred nucleation sites. XPS results show a
   slight positive charging of the small Cu clusters at 0.2 ML coverage,
   which disappears at higher coverage. The single-layer Au islands formed
   at low coverage show some evidence of positive charging as well, which
   likewise disappears with increasing cluster size. Additionally, the Au
   clusters show a trend of increasing metallicity as the clusters grow and
   transition from single-layer islands to 3D structures, demonstrated by
   the increasing asymmetry in the Au 4f line shape as a function of Au
   coverage. In general, the observed charge transfer trends are supported
   by Bader charge analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Endoscopic optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging has been
   demonstrated using microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technology by
   several research groups. The focus of this work is to study how the OCT
   imaging performance is affected by the radius of curvature of MEMS
   mirrors as well as the optical alignment accuracy inside small imaging
   probes. The goal of this study is to provide guidance for assembly
   tolerance and design optimization of OCT endoscopic probes. Gaussian
   beam propagation is used for theoretical analysis which is confirmed by
   optical simulation and verified experimentally with a time-domain OCT
   system as well. It has been found that the OCT imaging is very sensitive
   to the distance from the fiber end to the gradient-index (GRIN) lens,
   which needs to be controlled within 0.1 mm to achieve working distance
   (WD) longer than 3.5 mm and lateral resolution around 25 mu m. The
   impact on image quality of the MEMS mirror is negligible if the radius
   of curvature of the mirror surface is greater than 200 mm. In addition,
   we studied the astigmatism introduced by cylindrical plastic tubing; the
   maximum astigmatism ratio is 1.1 when the WD is around 2.5 mm. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{Background: Chemotherapy drugs have still the major disadvantage of
   non-specific cytotoxic effects. Although, new drugs targeting the genome
   of the tumor are already in the market, doublet chemotherapy regimens
   still remain the cornerstone of lung cancer treatment. Novel modalities
   of administration are under investigation such as; aerosol, intratumoral
   and intravascular.
   Materials and methods: In the present study five chemotherapy drugs;
   paclitaxel, docetaxel, gemcitabine, carboplatin and cisplatin were
   nebulized with three different jet nebulizers (Maxineb (R), Sunmist (R),
   Invacare (R)) and six different residual cups at different
   concentrations. The purpose of the study was to identify the ``ideal{''}
   combination of nebulizer-residual cup design-drug-drug loading for a
   future concept of aerosol chemotherapy in lung cancer patients. The
   Mastersizer (R) 2000 was used to evaluate the aerosol droplet mass
   median aerodynamic diameter.
   Results: The drug, nebulizer and residual cup design greatly influences
   the producing droplet size (p < 0.005, in each case). However; the
   design of the residual cup is the most important factor affecting the
   produced droplet size (F = 834.6, p < 0.001). The drug loading plays a
   vital role in the production of the desired droplet size (F = 10.42, p <
   0.001). The smallest droplet size was produced at 8 ml loading (1.26 mu
   m), while it remained the same at 2, 4 and 6 mls of drug loading.
   Conclusion: The ideal nebulizer would be Maxineb (R), with a large
   residual cup (10 ml maximum loading capacity) and 8 mls loading and the
   drug with efficient pulmonary deposition would be docetaxel. (C) 2013

   Cotton: Application of the Expanded Growth Model}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 9}},
Abstract = {{Accumulation of plant biomass (Mg ha(-1)) with calendar time (wk) occurs
   as a result of photosynthesis for green land-based plants. A
   corresponding accumulation of mineral elements (kg ha(-1)) such as
   nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium occurs from the soil through plant
   roots. Field data from literature for the warm-season annual cotton
   (Gossypium hirsutum L.) are used in this analysis. The expanded growth
   model is used to describe accumulation of biomass and mineral elements
   with calendar time. The growth model predicts a simple linear
   relationship between biomass yield and the growth quantifier, which is
   confirmed with the data. The growth quantifier incorporates the unit
   processes of distribution of solar energy which drives biomass
   accumulation by photosynthesis, partitioning of biomass between
   light-gathering and structural components of the plants, and an aging
   function. A hyperbolic relationship between plant nutrient uptake and
   biomass yield is assumed, and is confirmed for the mineral elements
   nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. It is concluded that the rate
   limiting process in the system is biomass accumulation by photosynthesis
   and that nutrient accumulation occurs in virtual equilibrium with
   biomass accumulation. The expanded growth model describes field data
   from California and Alabama rather well. Furthermore, all model
   parameters were common for the two sites with the exception of the yield
   factor A which accounts for differences in soil types, environmental
   conditions, fertilizer levels, and plant population.}},

Title = {{Airborne lidar point cloud-based below-canopy line-of-sight visibility
   estimator}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{SEP 5}},
Abstract = {{Point cloud data collected by small-footprint lidar scanning systems
   have proven effective in modeling the forest canopy for extraction of
   tree parameters. Although line-of-sight visibility (LOSV) in complex
   forests may be important for military planning and search-and-rescue
   operations, the ability to estimate LOSV from lidar scanners is not well
   developed. A new estimator of below-canopy LOSV (BC-LOSV) by addressing
   the problem of estimation of lidar under-sampling of the forest
   understory is created. Airborne and terrestrial lidar scanning data were
   acquired for two forested sites in order to test a probabilistic model
   for BC-LOSV estimation solely from airborne lidar data. Individual
   crowns were segmented, and allometric projections of the probability
   model into the lower canopy and stem regions allowed the estimation of
   the likelihood of the presence of vision-blocking elements for any given
   LOSV vector. Using terrestrial lidar scans as ground truth, we found an
   approximate average absolute difference of 20\% between BC-LOSV
   estimates from the airborne and terrestrial point clouds, with minimal
   bias for either over- or underestimates. The model shows the usefulness
   of a data-driven approach to BC-LOSV estimation that depends only on
   small-footprint airborne lidar point cloud and physical knowledge of
   tree phenology. (c) 2013 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation

Title = {{Estimation of citrus canker lesion size using hyperspectral reflectance
   imaging}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{The Citrus industry has need for effective approaches to remove fruit
   with canker before they are shipped to selective international market
   such as the European Union. This research aims to determine the
   detectable size limit for cankerous lesions using hyperspectral imaging
   approaches. Previously developed multispectral algorithms using visible
   to near-infrared wavelengths, were used to segregate cankerous citrus
   fruits from other peel conditions (normal, greasy spot, insect damage,
   melanose, scab and wind scar). However, this previous work did not
   consider lesion size. A two-band ratio method with a simple threshold
   based classifier (ratio of reflectance at wavelengths 834 nm and 729
   nm), which gave maximum overall classification accuracy of 95.7\%, was
   selected for lesion size estimation in this study. The smallest size of
   cankerous lesion detected in terms of equivalent diameter was 1.66 mm.
   The effect of variation of threshold values and number of erosion cycles
   (applying morphological erosion multiple times to the image) on
   estimation of smallest detectable lesion was observed. It was found that
   small threshold values gave better canker classification accuracies,
   while exhibiting a lower overall classification accuracy. Meanwhile,
   higher threshold values portrayed the opposite tendency. The threshold
   value of 1.275 gave the optimum tradeoff between canker classification
   accuracy, overall classification accuracy and minimal lesion size
   detection. Increasing the number of erosion cycles reduced detection
   rates of smaller canker lesions, leading to the conclusion that a single
   erosion cycle gave the best size estimation results. The erosion kernel
   of the size 3 mm X 3 mm was used during the exploration.}},

Abstract = {{Hummers method is commonly used for the fabrication of graphene oxide
   (GO) from graphite particles. The oxidation process also leads to the
   cutting of graphene sheets into small pieces. From a thermodynamic
   perspective, it seems improbable that the aggressive, somewhat random
   oxidative cutting process could directly result In graphene nanosheets
   without destroying the intrinsic pi-conjugated structures and the
   associated exotic properties of graphene. In Hummers method, both KMnO4
   and NO2+ (nitronium ions) in concentrated H2SO4 solutions act as
   oxidants via different oxidation mechanisms. From both experimental
   observations and theoretical calculations, it appears that KMnO4 plays a
   major role in the observed oxidative cutting and unzipping processes. We
   find that KMnO4 also limits nitronium oxidative etching of graphene
   basal planes, therefore slowing down graphene fracturing processes for
   nanosheet fabrication. By intentionally excluding KMnO4 and exploiting
   pure nitronium ion oxidation, aided by the unique thermal and kinetic
   effects induced by microwave heating, we find that graphite particles
   can be converted into graphene nanosheets with their it-conjugated
   aromatic structures and properties largely retained. Without the need of
   any postreduction processes to remove the high concentration of
   oxygenated groups that results from Hummers GO formation, the graphene
   nanosheets as-fabricated exhibit strong absorption, which Is nearly
   wavelength-Independent in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) regions,
   an optical property typical for intrinsic graphene sheets. For the first
   time, we demonstrate that strong photoacoustic signals can be generated
   from these graphene nanosheets with NIR excitation. The
   photo-to-acoustic conversion is weakly dependent on the wavelength of
   the NIR excitation, which is different from all other NIR photoacoustic
   contrast agents previously reported.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to evaluate the reduction in the
   vegetative vigor of Pampa vegetation cover in Brazil and Uruguay, by
   identifying negative trends in images time series. The following were
   used: time series of NDVI/EVI images from the Modis sensor, from 2000 to
   2011; images from soil moisture indices from the climate forecast system
   reanalysis; and precipitation data from meteorological stations. The
   study quantified linear and nonlinear trends in the NDVI and EVI series
   in grassland areas. With the Mann-Kendall monotonic trend, at 5\%
   probability, 81.9\% of the total area studied was significant with NDVI,
   and 74.8\% with EVI; however, EVI showed superior contrast in the
   estimation of parameters. The results showed: highest negative signal in
   the west, with average values of R-2>0.15, r<-0.3, and tau <-0.15 in the
   tendency of the vegetation indices; and decreasing tendency for NDVI,
   EVI, and rainfall, with lower mean soil moisture values. The negative
   trend of the vegetation indices, related to the combination of drought
   occurrence in surface soils with excessive grazing, indicates changes in
   the pattern of Pampa vegetation cover, with reduction in vegetative
   vigor.}},

Abstract = {{Feraheme, is a recently FDA-cleared superparamagnetic iron oxide
   nanoparticle (SPION)-based MRI contrast agent that is also employed in
   the treatment of iron deficiency anemia. Feraheme nanoparticles have a
   hydrodynamic diameter of 30 nm and consist of iron oxide crystallites
   complexed with a low molecular weight, semi-synthetic carbohydrate.
   These features are attractive for other potential biomedical
   applications such as magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH), since the
   carboxylated polymer coating affords functionalization of the particle
   surface and the size allows for accumulation in highly vascularized
   tumors via the enhanced permeability and retention effect. This work
   presents morphological and magnetic characterization of Feraheme by
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Energy dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy (EDX), and superconducting quantum interference device
   (SQUID) magnetometry. Additionally, the results of an initial evaluation
   of the suitability of Feraheme for MFH applications are described, and
   the data indicate the particles possess promising properties for this
   application.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical cues are employed to promote stem cell differentiation and
   functional tissue formation in tissue engineering and regenerative
   medicine. We have developed a Magnetic Force Bioreactor (MFB) that
   delivers highly targeted local forces to cells at a pico-newton level,
   utilizing magnetic micro- and nano-particles to target cell surface
   receptors. In this study, we investigated the effects of magnetically
   targeting and actuating specific two mechanical-sensitive cell membrane
   receptorsplatelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and integrin
   (3). It was found that a higher mineral-to-matrix ratio was obtained
   after three weeks of magneto-mechanical stimulation coupled with
   osteogenic medium culture by initially targeting PDGFR compared with
   targeting integrin (3) and non-treated controls. Moreover, different
   initiation sites caused a differentiated response profile when using a
   2-day-lagged magneto-mechanical stimulation over culture periods of 7
   and 12 days). However, both resulted in statistically higher osteogenic
   marker genes expression compared with immediate magneto-mechanical
   stimulation. These results provide insights into important parameters
   for designing appropriate protocols for ex vivo induced bone formation
   via magneto-mechanical actuation.}},

Abstract = {{AlGaN/GaN based metal-insulator-semiconductor high-electron-mobility

   AlN as the gate insulator and passivation layer were demonstrated. A
   refractive index of 1.92 for the deposited AlN was measured using an
   ellipsometer, which was slightly lower than that of bulk AlN. The
   deviation of the refractive index from the ideal value was caused by AlN
   surface oxidation, and this was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy and Auger depth profiling analyses. The HEMT drain current
   was modulated with gate voltages ranging from -3 to +4V. The HEMT
   exhibited an on-off ratio of 3.3 x 10(8) due to the low gate leakage
   current and a maximum saturation drain current of 600 mA/mm. Beside
   reducing the gate leakage current, the effectiveness of the HEMT
   passivation was confirmed by gate pulse measurements, which showed only
   a 7\% decrease of the drain current. (C) 2013 American Vacuum Society.}},

Abstract = {{In0.17Al0.83N/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) were

   little change after lower dose gamma-ray irradiations (< 200 Mrad).
   However, the electrical properties were significantly degraded after 500

Abstract = {{Nominally undoped GaN films were grown by metalorganic chemical vapor
   deposition under three different conditions, namely (1) ``standard{''}
   growth conditions with growth temperature of 1000 degrees C and growth
   rate of 1 mu m/h, (2) slightly reduced growth temperature of 975 degrees
   C, and (3) standard temperature, but higher growth rate of 2.5 mu m/h.
   The standard sample had a net donor density < 10(15) cm(-3), while the
   two other samples were semi-insulating, with sheet resistivity similar
   to 10(14) Omega/square and the Fermi level pinned at E-c-0.8 eV for the
   low temperature growth and at E-c-0.9 eV for the high growth rate
   conditions. The photoconductivity spectra of both of these latter
   samples show the presence of centers with optical threshold near 1.35 eV
   commonly attributed to C interstitials and centers with optical
   threshold near 2.7-2.8 eV and 3 eV often associated with C-related
   defects. However, no signals that could be attributed to substitutional
   C acceptors and C donors were detected. Current relaxation spectroscopy
   revealed deep traps with activation energies 0.2, 0.25, 045, and 0.8 eV.
   Annealing at 800 degrees C increased the concentration of these traps.
   The changes in resistivity induced by annealing in the high-growth rate
   sample were much stronger than for the low-temperature sample. The
   authors also observed a strong suppression of the yellow luminescence
   band intensity in the ``standard{''} sample after annealing, as opposed
   to a slight increase of this band intensity in the two semi-insulating
   samples. The role of compensation by native defects and by deep levels
   related to carbon in the observed changes is discussed. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{In this work, chitosan-modified biochars were synthesized in efforts to
   produce a low-cost adsorbent for heavy metal environmental remediation.
   Characterization results showed that the coating of chitosan on biochar
   surfaces could improve its performance as a soil amendment or an
   adsorbent. Batch sorption experiments showed that, compared to the
   unmodified biochars, almost all the chitosan-modified biochars showed
   enhanced removal of three metals (i.e., Pb2+, Cu2+, and Cd2+) from
   solution. Further investigations of lead sorption on chitosan-modified
   bamboo biochar (i.e., BB-C) indicated that, although sorption kinetics
   were slow, BB-C had a relatively high Langmuir lead sorption capacity of
   14.3 mg/g biochar (71.5 mg/g chitosan). Sorption of lead on the
   chitosan-modified biochar greatly reduced its metal toxicity. Both seed
   germination rate and seedling growth of the Pb-laden BB-C were similar
   to that of control groups without lead. In addition, uptake of lead by
   plants was reduced about 60\% when lead was sorbed onto the
   chitosan-modified biochar. This work suggests that chitosan-modified
   biochars may be used as an effective, low-cost, and
   environmental-friendly adsorbent to remediate heavy metal contamination
   in the environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to propose a new method to determine
   design floods using the critical storm duration concept. Five different
   models, including the Rational, SCS, and Clark methods, were used to
   estimate peak discharges, while the uniform distribution, Mononobe,
   Huff, and Yen and Chow methods were applied for the determination of
   temporal rainfall distribution. Two small watersheds, Baran (HP\#6) and
   Banweol (WS\#1), for which watershed hydrologic data were available
   since 1996, were selected as the study areas. A total of 41 rainfall
   events was chosen from the study watersheds to calculate peak runoffs
   and evaluate the performances of the selected hydrological models based
   on the statistics of RMSE, Nash efficiency criterion (NEC), and R-2
   value. The Clark method performed the best overall among the selected
   models, with both NEC and R-2 values greater than 0.95. The Huff method
   resulted in the longest critical storm duration, which was much greater
   than the times of concentration. The increase in the recurrence interval
   decreased the critical storm duration while increasing the peak flow
   rates. The SCS model estimated the greatest design floods, 94.2 m(3)/s
   for HP\#6 and 56.4 m(3)/s for WS\#1, with a 25-year return period. The
   design floods for the study watersheds that were estimated by the
   selected hydrologic models ranged from 68.3 to 132.1\% of those
   estimated by the Rational method. The greatest to the smallest peak
   flows resulted from the SCS, WFRP, Clark and Nakayasu methods in order.
   As an alternative to the Rational method, the WFRP method may be
   appropriate for rural watershed areas in Korea, where paddy fields
   commonly exist, whereas the SCS model may be more suitable for urban
   areas, where most land surfaces are covered with impervious material. It
   was concluded that the incorporation of a critical storm duration
   concept can contribute to the advance of design flood estimation method
   in Korea. (C) 2013 International Association for Hydro-environment

Abstract = {{Interest in atomic scale computational simulations of multi-phase
   systems has grown as our ability to simulate nanometer-sized systems has
   become commonplace. The recently developed charge optimized many body
   potential (COMB) potentials have significantly enhanced the atomic-scale
   simulation of heterogeneous material systems, including chemical
   reactions at surfaces and the physical properties of interfaces. The
   COMB formalism, which merges variable charge electrostatic interactions
   with a classical analytical potential, has the capacity to adaptively
   model metallic, covalent, ionic and van der Waals bonding in the same
   simulation cell and dynamically determine the charges according to the
   local environment. Presented here is the theoretical background and
   evolution of the COMB potential family. The parameterization of the
   potential is described for several metals, ceramics, a semiconductor,
   and hydrocarbons, with the intent that the final parameter sets are
   consistent among materials. The utility of this approach is illustrated
   with several examples that explore the structure, stability, and
   mechanical and thermal properties of metallic systems and metal-ceramic
   and semi-conductor oxide interfaces, including surfaces and/or
   interfaces of copper and cuprite, copper and silica, silicon and silica,
   silicon and hafnia, and copper and zinc oxide. The potential is also
   applied to the simulation of atomic scale processes such as early stage
   oxidation of copper surfaces, tensile test of polycrystalline zirconium,
   and hyper-thermal deposition of ethyl radicals on selected copper
   surfaces. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In distributed collaborative networks such as peer-to-peer systems,
   privacy preserving information sharing and dissemination heavily relies
   on effective trust management. Trust based encryption (TBE) has been
   proposed to be a solution to enabling privacy preserving information
   sharing and dissemination for such networks. Unfortunately, the
   previously proposed schemes are not efficient in terms of communications
   overhead, and require a constantly online trust authority. In this
   paper, we propose two trust based encryption schemes with significantly
   improved efficiency. In the first scheme, we develop a generic
   transformation approach based on the recently proposed identity based
   broadcast encryption (IBBE) technique, which can significantly reduce
   both memory space and communication overhead when static reputation is
   considered. For the dynamic reputation scenarios, we present a trust
   based encryption scheme which is based on a recently proposed revocable
   identity based encryption technique, resulting in significantly reduced
   communication overhead at the central trust authority.}},

Abstract = {{Collecting information from mobile peer-to-peer (P2P) networks has
   important civilian and military applications. One problem is to
   determine the cardinality, i.e., the number of nodes, in a large mobile
   system. In a stationary wireless network, it can be trivially solved
   through a flooding-based query. However, the problem becomes much more
   challenging for mobile P2P networks whose topologies are constantly
   changing. In this paper, we present two novel statistical methods,
   called the circled random walk and the tokened random walk, to address
   this interesting problem. The circled random walk is simpler to
   implement and works well in networks of high mobility, whereas the
   tokened random walk works well with high or low mobility. These methods
   provide cardinality estimation by involving only a small subset of the
   nodes. They make tradeoff between overhead and estimation accuracy. The
   estimation error can be made arbitrarily small at the expense of larger
   overhead.}},

   understanding an intercultural interaction - interaction attentiveness -
   played the greatest and most statistically significant role in

Abstract = {{Previous research has shown that sea-level acceleration determined from
   individual tide gauge records has remarkably large scatter as record
   lengths decrease due to decadal variations in sea level. We extend
   previous data sets to the present time and find even greater
   acceleration scatter. Using analytic solutions, sinusoidal oscillations
   with amplitudes and periods of typical decadal variations are shown to
   basically account for the relationship between record length and both
   acceleration and trend difference. Data show that decadal variations
   will obscure estimates of underlying accelerations if record lengths of
   individual gauges are not greater than at least 75 years. Although
   worldwide data are less affected by decadal variations than individual
   gauge data, decadal variations still significantly affect estimates of
   underlying accelerations, in particular for record lengths less than
   about 60 years. We give two examples of recent studies that use record
   lengths of about 30 to 60 years to determine acceleration or related
   trend difference. Previous authors dismissed the importance of decadal
   variations on their results and, as a result, reached invalid
   conclusions.}},

Abstract = {{Landslides are important geomorphic events that sculpt river basins by
   eroding hillslopes and providing sediments to coastal areas. However,
   landslides are also hazardous events for socio-ecological systems in
   river basins causing enormous biodiversity, economic, and social
   impacts. We propose a probabilistic spatially explicit model for the
   prediction of landslide patterns based on a maximum entropy principle
   model (MAXENT). The model inputs are the centers of mass of historical
   landslides and environmental variables at the basin scale. The model has
   only three parameters requiring calibration: the threshold for the
   network extraction, the trade-off factor between model complexity and
   accuracy, and the threshold of landslide susceptibility. The calibration
   on a subset of observations detects the environmental drivers and their
   relative importance for landslides. We employ the model in the Arno
   basin, Italy, selected because of its widespread landslide dynamics and
   the large availability of landslide observations. The model reproduces
   the size distribution and location of over 27,500 historical landslides
   for the Arno basin with an accuracy of 86\% obtained from the
   variable-landslide inference on about 37\% of observed landslides.
   Future landslide patterns are predicted for 17 A1B and A2 rainfall
   scenarios and for a multimodel ensemble from 2000 to 2100. We show that
   potential landslide hazard is strongly correlated with variation in the
   12 and 48 h rainfall with a return time of 10 years. As the climate gets
   wetter, the average probability of landslides gets higher which is shown
   by the landslide size distribution. Hence, the landslide size
   distribution is a fingerprint of the geomorphic effectiveness of
   rainfall as a function of climate change. MAXENT is proposed as a
   parsimonious model for the prediction of landslide patterns with respect
   to more complex models. The need for very accurately sampled and
   delineated landslides is lower than for other prediction models.
   Moreover, the model informs about the drivers of landslides and their
   relative importance without assumptions on the main triggering factors.
   This is important to inform monitoring of environmental variables. Our
   modeling approach can enhance the planning of socio-ecological systems
   in river basins by improving the accuracy of landslide prediction in
   space and time.}},

Title = {{Uncertainty in simulating wheat yields under climate change}},
Journal = {{NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{827-832}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Projections of climate change impacts on crop yields are inherently
   uncertain(1). Uncertainty is often quantified when projecting future
   greenhouse gas emissions and their influence on climate(2). However,
   multi-model uncertainty analysis of crop responses to climate change is
   rare because systematic and objective comparisons among process-based
   crop simulation models(1,3) are difficult(4). Here we present the
   largest standardized model intercomparison for climate change impacts so
   far. We found that individual crop models are able to simulate measured
   wheat grain yields accurately under a range of environments,
   particularly if the input information is sufficient. However, simulated
   climate change impacts vary across models owing to differences in model
   structures and parameter values. A greater proportion of the uncertainty
   in climate change impact projections was due to variations among crop
   models than to variations among downscaled general circulation models.
   Uncertainties in simulated impacts increased with CO2 concentrations and
   associated warming. These impact uncertainties can be reduced by
   improving temperature and CO2 relationships in models and better
   quantified through use of multi-model ensembles. Less uncertainty in
   describing how climate change may affect agricultural productivity will
   aid adaptation strategy development and policymaking.}},

Title = {{Reliability Based Design Optimization Modeling Future Redesign With
   Different Epistemic Uncertainty Treatments}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Design under uncertainty needs to account for aleatory uncertainty, such
   as variability in material properties, and epistemic uncertainty
   including errors due to imperfect analysis tools. While there is a
   consensus that aleatory uncertainty be described by probability
   distributions, for epistemic uncertainty there is a tendency to be more
   conservative by taking worst case scenarios or 95th percentiles. This
   conservativeness may result in substantial performance penalties.
   Epistemic uncertainty, however, is usually reduced by additional
   knowledge typically provided by tests. Then, redesign may take place if
   tests show that the design is not acceptable. This paper proposes a
   reliability based design optimization (RBDO) method that takes into
   account the effects of future tests possibly followed by redesign. We
   consider each realization of epistemic uncertainty to correspond to a
   different design outcome. Then, the future scenario, i.e., test and
   redesign, of each possible design outcome is simulated. For an
   integrated thermal protection system (ITPS) design, we show that the
   proposed method reduces the mass penalty associated with a 95th
   percentile of the epistemic uncertainty from 2.7\% to 1.2\% compared to
   standard RBDO, which does not account for the future. We also show that
   the proposed approach allows trading off mass against development costs
   as measured by probability of needing redesign. Finally, we demonstrate
   that the tradeoff can be achieved even with the traditional safety
   factor based design.}},

   the quantized kernel recursive least squares algorithm. The good

Abstract = {{Real power injections at loads and generators, and real power flows on
   selected lines in a transmission network are monitored and transmitted
   over a SCADA network to the system operator. These are used in state
   estimation algorithms to make dispatch, re-balance and other energy
   management system {[}EMS] decisions. Coordinated cyber attacks on power
   meter readings can be designed to be undetectable by any bad data
   detection algorithm. These unobservable attacks present a serious threat
   to grid operations. Of particular interest are sparse attacks that
   involve the compromise of a modest number of meter readings. An
   efficient algorithm to find all unobservable attacks {[}under standard
   DC load flow approximations] involving the compromise of exactly two
   power injection meters and an arbitrary number of power meters on lines
   is presented. This requires O(n(2)m) flops for a power system with buses
   and line meters. If all lines are metered, there exist canonical forms
   that characterize all 3, 4, and 5-sparse unobservable attacks. These can
   be quickly detected with O(n(2)) flops using standard graph algorithms.
   Known-secure phasor measurement units {[}PMUs] can be used as
   countermeasures against a given collection of cyber attacks. Finding the
   minimum number of necessary PMUs is NP-hard. It is shown that p + 1 PMUs
   at carefully chosen buses are sufficient to neutralize a collection of
   cyber attacks.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the minimization of the total energy cost
   of multiple residential households in a smart grid neighborhood sharing
   a load serving entity. Specifically, each household may have renewable
   generation, energy storage as well as inelastic and elastic energy
   loads, and the load serving entity attempts to coordinate the energy
   consumption of these households in order to minimize the total energy
   cost within this neighborhood. The renewable generation, the energy
   demand arrival, and the energy cost function are all stochastic
   processes and evolve according to some, possibly unknown, probabilistic
   laws. We develop an online control algorithm, called Lyapunov-based cost
   minimization algorithm (LCMA), which jointly considers the energy
   management and demand management decisions. LCMA only needs to keep
   track of the current values of the underlying stochastic processes
   without requiring any knowledge of their statistics. Moreover, a
   decentralized algorithm to implement LCMA is also developed, which can
   preserve the privacy of individual household owners. Numerical results
   based on real-world trace data show that our control algorithm can
   effectively reduce the total energy cost in the neighborhood.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a theoretical framework of energy-optimal mobile
   cloud computing under stochastic wireless channel. Our objective is to
   conserve energy for the mobile device, by optimally executing mobile
   applications in the mobile device (i.e., mobile execution) or offloading
   to the cloud (i.e., cloud execution). One can, in the former case
   sequentially reconfigure the CPU frequency; or in the latter case
   dynamically vary the data transmission rate to the cloud, in response to
   the stochastic channel condition. We formulate both scheduling problems
   as constrained optimization problems, and obtain closed-form solutions
   for optimal scheduling policies. Furthermore, for the energy-optimal
   execution strategy of applications with small output data (e. g.,
   CloudAV), we derive a threshold policy, which states that the data
   consumption rate, defined as the ratio between the data size (L) and the
   delay constraint (T), is compared to a threshold which depends on both
   the energy consumption model and the wireless channel model. Finally,
   numerical results suggest that a significant amount of energy can be
   saved for the mobile device by optimally offloading mobile applications
   to the cloud in some cases. Our theoretical framework and numerical
   investigations will shed lights on system implementation of mobile cloud
   computing under stochastic wireless channel.}},

Title = {{Lift evaluation of a two-dimensional pitching flat plate}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Several previous experimental and theoretical studies have shown that a
   leading edge vortex (LEV) on an airfoil or wing can provide lift
   enhancement. In this paper, unsteady two-dimensional (2D) potential flow
   theory is employed to model the flow field of a pitching flat plate
   wing. A multi-vortices model is developed to model both the leading edge
   and trailing edge vortices (TEVs), which offers improved accuracy
   compared with using only single vortex at each separation location. The
   lift is obtained by integrating the unsteady Blasius equation. It is
   found that the motion of vortices contributes significantly to the
   overall aerodynamic force on the flat plate. A Kutta-like condition is
   used to determine the vortex intensity and location at the leading edge
   for large angle of attack cases; however, it is proposed to relax this
   condition for small angle of attack cases and apply a 2D shear layer
   model to calculate the circulation of the new added vortex. The results
   of the simulation are then compared with classical numerical,
   theoretical, and experimental data for canonical unsteady flat plat
   problems. Good agreement with these data is observed. Moreover, these
   results suggested that the leading edge vortex shedding for small angles
   of attack should be modeled differently than that for large angles of
   attack. Finally, the results of vortex motion vs. lift indicate that the
   slow convection of the LEV creates less negative lift while the rapid
   shedding of the TEV creates more positive lift. The difference between
   these two contributions of lift results in a total positive lift that
   lasts for about two chord-length travel of the plate. It is therefore
   concluded that the lift enhancement during the LEV ``stabilization{''}
   above the wing is a combined effect of both the LEV and TEV motion. This
   also provides the insights for future active flow control of micro
   aerial vehicles (MAVs) that the formation and shedding process of LEVs
   and TEVs can be manipulated to provide lift enhancement. (C) 2013 AIP

Abstract = {{We have developed an application of 2D time-domain waveform tomography
   for detection of embedded sinkholes and anomalies. The measured seismic
   surface wavefields were inverted using a full-waveform inversion (FWI)
   technique, based on a finite-difference solution of 2D elastic wave
   equations and the Gauss-Newton inversion method. The key advantage of
   this approach is the ability to generate all possible wave propagation
   modes of seismic wavefields (body waves and Rayleigh waves) that are
   then compared with measured data to infer complex subsurface properties.
   The pressure-wave (P-wave) and shear-wave (S-wave) velocities are
   inverted independently and simultaneously. The FWI was applied to one
   synthetic and two real experimental data sets. The inversion results of
   synthetic data showed the useful capability of the waveform analysis in
   identifying an embedded void. The inversion results of real data sets
   showed that the waveform analysis was able to delineate (1) an embedded
   concrete culvert and (2) a complex profile with an embedded void and
   highly variable bedrock laterally and vertically. An independent
   invasive test (standard penetration test) was also conducted to verify
   the seismic test results.}},

   biochemical methane potential (BMP) of 200 ml CH4 at STP (g VS)(-1) was
   obtained. The whole stillage was separated into two fractions: a
   fraction retained on 0.5 mm screen called residue and a fraction passing
   through 0.5 mm screen called filtrate. About 70\% of total methane yield
   of stillage was produced from the filtrate. The filtrate was
   anaerobically digested in a 15 L semi-continuously fed digester operated
   for 91 days at HRTs of 21 and 14 days and organic loading rate (OLR) of
   1.85 and 2.39 g COD L-1 d(-1). The methane yield from the stillage from
   the digester was about 90\% of the yield from the BMP assays. The
   influent soluble COD (sCOD) was reduced from between 35.4 and 38.8 g COD
   (L-1) to between 7.5 and 8 g COD (L-1). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the problem of resource allocation in multiradio
   multichannel (MRMC) networks. Specifically, under the consideration of
   diverse quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, we propose a fair
   QoS-aware resource-allocation scheme for MRMC networks. In this scheme,
   channel allocation, multipath routing, link scheduling, and radio
   assignment are jointly considered. The proposed scheme is obtained by
   formulating the resource-allocation problem into a cross-layer network
   utility maximization (NUM) problem, in which resources are allocated to
   services with proportional fairness. To avoid oscillation among optimal
   solutions due to the use of multipath routing, we transform the
   optimization program into an equivalent program by utilizing the
   proximal optimization algorithm. Then, we obtain the optimal solution of
   the latter by the decomposition method. Numerical results show that the
   proposed scheme indeed achieves proportional fairness according to
   diverse QoS requirements while maximizing utility.}},

Abstract = {{A straightforward approach allowing three-dimensional (3D) visualization
   of subsurface deformation beneath nanoindents using reconstructed
   cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) data is
   demonstrated. This approach relies on generating an array of
   nanoindents, extracting a thin (<200 nm) cross section using a focused
   ion beam (FIB) and imaging with a transmission electron microscope. By
   rotating the orientation of the FIB cross section with respect to the
   array of nanoindents at the optimal angle, it is guaranteed that a
   different section of each nanoindent's subsurface plastic zone is
   contained within the final cross section. Subsequently, TEM images
   corresponding to different sections are reconstructed into a 3D image of
   a representative nanoindentation plastic zone. This approach can be
   extended to any array of nominally identical features that can be
   patterned with regular spacing and included in a single FIB cross
   section. It was also found to significantly enhance the throughput of
   preparing routine site-specific TEM samples, even when 3D visualization
   is not necessary. In this article, the approach is applied to visualize
   the plastic zones beneath nanoindents in GaAs (001), for loads of
   50-1000 mu N.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGICAL METHODS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{94}},

Abstract = {{Biofilms are ubiquitous and play an essential role in both environmental
   processes and hospital infections. Standard methods are not capable of
   quantifying biomass concentration in dilute suspensions. Furthermore,
   standard techniques cannot differentiate biomass composition. In this
   study, a user-friendly technique was developed for measuring biomass
   cell and polymer content in detached biofilms using a standard coulter
   counter. The method was demonstrated for an environmentally relevant
   strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Schroeter) Migula grown in a
   bioreactor and also for a medically relevant strain of P. aeruginosa
   (PAO1) grown on standard growth pegs. Results were compared and
   validated by standard assays, including EPA method 1684 for measuring
   biomass, microscopic direct counts, and a crystal violet staining assay.
   The minimum detection limit for the coulter counter method (0.07
   mg-biomass L-1) was significantly lower than the EPA method 1684 (1.9
   +/- 0.4 mg/L) and the crystal violet assay (1.1 +/- 0.2 mg L-1).
   However, the coulter counter method is limited to dilute biomass samples
   (below 204 +/- 16 mg L-1) due to clogging of the aperture tube. While
   biomass measurements are useful, the major advantage of the coulter
   counter method is the ability to directly determine EPS, cell, and
   aggregate fractions after mild chemical treatment. The rapid technique
   (4-5 min per sample) was used to measure biomass fractions in dispersed
   P. aeruginosa (Schroeter) and PAO1 biofilms. This technique will be
   critical for understanding biofilm formation/dispersal. (C) 2013

   orders of magnitude more resistant to radiation damage than GaAs of
   similar doping concentrations. In terms of heterostructures, preliminary

Abstract = {{Oxygen-deficient BaTiO3- nanoceramics were prepared by spark plasma
   sintering. Partially reduced raw nanopowders led to unusual dielectric
   properties. A short postsintering treatment was performed to reach a
   high epsilon(r)/tan , which makes them attractive for industrial
   applications such as low-frequency capacitors. Surprisingly, our
   ceramics also remained black even after annealing for 5days at 850
   degrees C in air, indicating the presence of barriers against oxygen
   diffusion. This exceptional behavior in pure barium titanate was
   consistent with a core-shell structure made of semiconductive grains and
   insulating grain boundaries, due to the presence of Ti3+/Ti4+ and oxygen
   vacancies.}},

Abstract = {{For over a century epileptic seizures have been known to cluster at
   specific times of the day. Recent studies have suggested that the
   circadian regulatory system may become permanently altered in epilepsy,
   but little is known about how this affects neural activity and the daily
   pattern of seizures. To investigate, we tracked long-term changes in the
   rate of spontaneous hippocampal EEG spikes (SPKs) in a rat model of
   temporal lobe epilepsy. In healthy animals, SPKs oscillated with near
   24-h period; however, after injury by status epilepticus, a persistent
   phase shift of similar to 12 h emerged in animals that later went on to
   develop chronic spontaneous seizures. Additional measurements showed
   that global 24-h rhythms, including core body temperature and theta
   state transitions, did not phase shift. Instead, we hypothesized that
   locally impaired circadian input to the hippocampus might be responsible
   for the SPK phase shift. This was investigated with a biophysical
   computer model in which we showed that subtle changes in the relative
   strengths of circadian input could produce a phase shift in hippocampal
   neural activity. MRI provided evidence that the medial septum, a
   putative circadian relay center for the hippocampus, exhibits signs of
   damage and therefore could contribute to local circadian impairment. Our
   results suggest that balanced circadian input is critical to maintaining
   natural circadian phase in the hippocampus and that damage to circadian
   relay centers, such as the medial septum, may disrupt this balance. We
   conclude by discussing how abnormal circadian regulation may contribute
   to the daily rhythms of epileptic seizures and related cognitive
   dysfunction.}},

Pages = {{1213-1224}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A long-term (30 year) historical analysis of turfgrass monthly net
   irrigation requirements for southeast USA is analyzed and discussed in
   this paper. The process involved gathering weather data for ten
   locations in Florida plus one in Alabama, from 1980 through 2009, and
   data quality. Available weather data included maximum and minimum
   temperature, maximum and minimum relative humidity, wind speed, and
   rainfall. Solar radiation was estimated using the Hargreaves-Samani
   equation, and coefficients were calibrated for every location. Reference
   evapotranspiration (ETos) was calculated using the ASCE-EWRI
   standardized reference evapotranspiration equation. Net irrigation was
   estimated using a daily soil-water balance. Variability in soil types
   and root depth was taken into account during the simulations, and three
   sets of monthly K (c) values from the literature were applied from north
   through south Florida. Results showed that the calibrated
   Hargreaves-Samani adjustment coefficients varied from 0.14 in
   Tallahassee to 0.24 in Key West, with an inland average value of 0.15,
   and a coastal average value of 0.18. The calculated ETos ranged from
   1,296 mm year(-1) in Tallahassee to 1,658 mm year(-1) in Miami. The
   estimated net irrigation ranged from 423 mm year(-1) in Mobile, AL, to
   1,063 mm year(-1) in Key West, FL. The number of irrigation events per
   year varied from 25 in Mobile to 161 in Key West. May and December were
   the months with the highest and lowest net irrigation requirements,
   respectively.}},

Title = {{Field-scale prediction of enhanced DNAPL dissolution based on
   partitioning tracers}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{152}},
Pages = {{147-158}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The equilibrium streamtube model (EST) has demonstrated the ability to
   accurately predict dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) dissolution in
   laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. Here the model is
   applied to predict DNAPL dissolution at a tetrachloroethylene
   (PCE)-contaminated dry cleaner site, located in Jacksonville, Florida.
   The EST model is an analytical solution with field-measurable input
   parameters. Measured data from a field-scale partitioning tracer test
   were used to parameterize the EST model and the predicted PCE
   dissolution was compared to measured data from an in-situ ethanol flood.
   In addition, a simulated partitioning tracer test from a calibrated,
   three-dimensional, spatially explicit multiphase flow model (UTCHEM) was
   also used to parameterize the EST analytical solution. The EST ethanol
   prediction based on both the field partitioning tracer test and the
   simulation closely matched the total recovery well field ethanol data
   with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency E = 0.96 and 0.90, respectively. The EST
   PCE predictions showed a peak shift to earlier arrival times for models
   based on either field-measured or simulated partitioning tracer tests,
   resulting in poorer matches to the field PCE data in both cases. The
   peak shifts were concluded to be caused by well screen interval
   differences between the field tracer test and ethanol flood. Both the
   EST model and UTCHEM were also used to predict PCE aqueous dissolution
   under natural gradient conditions, which has a much less complex flow
   pattern than the forced-gradient double five spot used for the ethanol
   flood. The natural gradient EST predictions based on parameters
   determined from tracer tests conducted with a complex flow pattern
   underestimated the UTCHEM-simulated natural gradient total mass removal
   by 12\% after 170 pore volumes of water flushing indicating that some
   mass was not detected by the tracers likely due to stagnation zones in
   the flow field. These findings highlight the important influence of well
   configuration and the associated flow patterns on dissolution. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This article presents a parcel-level methodology to estimate the water
   and energy savings associated with indoor water conservation best
   management practices (BMPs). By estimating fixtures' water savings at
   the parcel level for 64 public-supply land use sectors, this approach
   facilitates targeting customers for water conservation by calculating
   their net benefits for each end use (savings in charges for water,
   wastewater, and energy minus the cost of water conservation BMPs). The
   inclusion of energy savings, primarily through reduced hot water use, is
   shown to be a significant benefit. The modeled end uses are male-only
   toilets, mixed-use toilets, urinals, faucets, showerheads, clothes
   washers, and prerinse spray valves. The article concludes with a
   simplified optimization formulation that determines the best fixture
   choice for every end-use device so that net benefits at the parcel level
   are maximized. These individual fixture results are then aggregated to
   the parcel or any desired aggregate scale (e.g., utility).}},

Journal = {{PROTEIN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1258-1265}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Dilution of protein-surfactant complexes is an integrated step in
   microfluidic protein sizing, where the contribution of free micelles to
   the overall fluorescence is reduced by dilution. This process can be
   further improved by establishing an optimum surfactant concentration and
   quantifying the amount of protein based on the fluorescence intensity.
   To this end, we study the interaction of proteins with anionic sodium
   dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and cationic hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide
   (CTAB) using a hydrophobic fluorescent dye (sypro orange). We analyze
   these interactions fluourometrically with bovine serum albumin, carbonic
   anhydrase, and beta-galactosidase as model proteins. The fluorescent
   signature of protein-surfactant complexes at various dilution points
   shows three distinct regions, surfactant dominant, breakdown, and
   protein dominant region. Based on the dilution behavior of
   protein-surfactant complexes, we propose a fluorescence model to explain
   the contribution of free and bound micelles to the overall fluorescence.
   Our results show that protein peak is observed at 3 mM SDS as the
   optimum dilution concentration. Furthermore, we study the effect of
   protein concentration on fluorescence intensity. In a single protein
   model with a constant dye quantum yield, the peak height increases with
   protein concentration. Finally, addition of CTAB to the protein-SDS
   complex at mole fractions above 0.1 shifts the protein peak from 3 mM to
   4 mM SDS. The knowledge of protein-surfactant interactions obtained from
   these studies provides significant insights for novel detection and
   quantification techniques in microfluidics.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanisms responsible for the modulation of laterally sheared
   non-tidal (residual) exchange flow in a subtropical inlet, with special
   emphasis on tropical storm influence, are studied using a combination of
   current velocity profiles and hydrographic and meteorological data. The
   mouth of the inlet, St. Augustine Inlet in northeast Florida, is
   characterized by a 15-m-deep channel flanked by shoals (< 6 m deep).
   Residual flows across the inlet mouth were laterally sheared with inflow
   in the channel and outflow over the shoals. This pattern persisted
   during four separate semi-diurnal tidal cycle surveys effected over 3
   years. During spring tides, residual exchange flows intensified relative
   to neap tides. Residual inflow in the channel only reversed immediately
   after tropical storms because of their extreme winds and major temporal
   changes in water level. After the residual flow reversed in the channel,
   along-channel baroclinicity drove gravitational circulation that
   persisted for 4.5 days and was enhanced by offshore winds. A
   depth-averaged along-basin momentum budget highlighted the importance of
   bottom friction to help balance the barotropic pressure gradient. The
   rest of the momentum budget was likely provided by advective terms.
   During and after tropical storms, accelerations from wind stress and
   baroclinic pressure gradients also became influential in the along-basin
   momentum budget.}},

Abstract = {{Grain protein has recently received attention in several countries
   because of a premium associated to increased protein concentration (PC)
   in grains. Nitrogen (N) fertilizer management with its timing of
   application and rates plays a crucial role in increasing PC. The
   objectives of the present study were to: (1) quantify the effects of
   different N fertilizer rates and timing of application on grain yield
   and grain protein of six durum wheat cultivars, and (2) identify the
   best cultivar in terms of net return, yield, and protein content in
   typical pedo-climatic condition of southern Italy. The field experiments
   were conducted in Foggia during three growing seasons (2002-2003,
   2003-2004, and 2004-2005). Results from this study showed that N
   application at sowing did not influence the cultivars performance. N
   applied at stem elongation increased yield and protein content provided
   there is adequate soil water for N uptake. In absolute terms, the best
   combination was the cultivar Svevo managed using 104 kg N ha(-1) split
   between tillering and stem-elongation stage. The excessive N splitting
   reduces yield and does not provide any improvement in terms of protein

Abstract = {{The transcriptome of seedlings was analyzed from experiments performed
   on the International Space Station to study the interacting effects of
   light and gravity on plant tropisms (project named TROPI-2; Kiss et al.
   2012). Seeds of Arabidopsis were germinated in space, and seedlings were
   then grown in the European Modular Cultivation System for 4 days at
   similar to 1g followed by exposure to a range of gravitational
   accelerations (from microgravity to 1g) and two light treatments (blue
   light with or without a 1 h pretreatment with red). At the end of the
   experiments, the cassettes containing the seedlings were frozen in the
   minus eighty laboratory freezer and returned to Earth on space shuttle
   mission STS-131. The RNA was extracted from whole seedlings and used for
   the transcriptome analyses. A comparison of 1g spaceflight samples with
   1g ground controls identified 230 genes that were differentially
   regulated at least twofold, emphasizing the need for ``in situ{''}
   tissue fixation on a 1g centrifuge as an important control for
   spaceflight experiments. A further comparison of all spaceflight samples
   with ground controls identified approximately 280 genes that were
   differentially regulated at least twofold. Of these genes, several were
   involved in regulating cell polarity (i.e., auxin, calcium, lipid
   metabolism), cell-wall development, oxygen status, and cell defense or
   stress. However, when the transcriptome of the all g-treated spaceflight
   samples was compared with microgravity samples, only similar to 130
   genes were identified as being differently regulated (P a parts per
   thousand currency sign 0.01). Of this subset, only 27 genes were at
   least twofold differently regulated between microgravity and 1g space
   samples and included putative/pseudo/undefined genes (14), transposable
   elements (5), an expansin (ATEXP24; At1g21240), a cell-wall kinase

Abstract = {{Oxygen plays a critical role in plant metabolism, stress
   response/signaling, and adaptation to environmental changes (Lambers and
   Colmer, Plant Soil 274:7-15, 2005; Pitzschke et al., Antioxid Redox
   Signal 8:1757-1764, 2006; Van Breusegem et al., Plant Sci 161:405-414,
   2001). Reactive oxygen species (ROS), by-products of various metabolic
   pathways in which oxygen is a key molecule, are produced during
   adaptation responses to environmental stress. While much is known about
   plant adaptation to stress (e.g., detoxifying enzymes, antioxidant
   production), the link between ROS metabolism, O-2 transport, and stress
   response mechanisms is unknown. Thus, non-invasive technologies for
   measuring O-2 are critical for understanding the link between
   physiological O-2 transport and ROS signaling. New non-invasive
   technologies allow real-time measurement of O-2 at the single cell and
   even organelle levels. This review briefly summarizes currently
   available (i.e., mainstream) technologies for measuring O-2 and then
   introduces emerging technologies for measuring O-2. Advanced techniques
   that provide the ability to non-invasively (i.e., non-destructively)
   measure O-2 are highlighted. In the near future, these non-invasive
   sensors will facilitate novel experimentation that will allow plant
   physiologists to ask new hypothesis-driven research questions aimed at
   improving our understanding of physiological O-2 transport.}},

Abstract = {{Whereas functionally different, both organogenesis and wound-healing
   processes create zones or regions of hypoxia that persist until
   capillary networks are formed to facilitate oxygen and nutrient
   delivery. Similarly, regenerative processes within in vitro engineered
   tissues experience the same hypoxic regions, but without the capacity to
   form functional capillaries resulting in a major limitation in
   developing full-thickness organs and tissues. Due to the importance of
   oxygen in wound healing and tissue regeneration, we hypothesize that
   directed oxygen gradients can be used to modulate cell function and
   promote more effective tissue regeneration. The effect of controlled
   oxygen gradients on human smooth muscle cells (SMCs) was assessed using
   dual chambered perfusion bioreactors to regulate transport conditions
   occurring in a model vascular construct. SMCs were seeded onto the
   ablumenal surface of the scaffold and cultured for 21 days under 3
   independent gas environments: (1) 21\% oxygen, (2) 11\% oxygen, or (3)
   an ablumen to lumen oxygen gradient from 11\% to 21\%. When compared to
   21\% oxygen and 11\% oxygen conditions, the directed 11\%-21\% oxygen
   gradient resulted in a raised metabolic activity and significantly
   improved cell migration. After 21 days from seeding, cells were shown to
   migrate entirely across the scaffold to the vessel lumen (>450 mu m).
   Concomitant with a more uniform cell dispersion, scaffold mechanics were
   significantly enhanced with increased stiffness and tensile strength.
   Native oxygen gradients are known to play a pivotal role during organ
   development; these results show that directed oxygen gradients within in
   vitro systems can be used to facilitate early remodeling leading to
   significantly enhanced cell migration and scaffold biomechanics.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{405}},
Pages = {{51-57}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Here, we report a simple and inexpensive bottom-up technology for
   fabricating superhydrophobic coatings with hierarchical
   micro-/nano-structures, which are inspired by the binary periodic
   structure found on the superhydrophobic compound eyes of some insects
   (e.g., mosquitoes and moths). Binary colloidal arrays consisting of
   exemplary large (4 and 30 mu m) and small (300 nm) silica spheres are
   first assembled by a scalable Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technology in a
   layer-by-layer manner. After surface modification with fluorosilanes,
   the self-assembled hierarchical particle arrays become superhydrophobic
   with an apparent water contact angle (CA) larger than 150 degrees. The
   throughput of the resulting superhydrophobic coatings with hierarchical
   structures can be significantly improved by templating the binary
   periodic structures of the LB-assembled colloidal arrays into UV-curable
   fluoropolymers by a soft lithography approach. Superhydrophobic
   perfluoroether acrylate hierarchical arrays with large CAs and small CA
   hysteresis can be faithfully replicated onto various substrates. Both
   experiments and theoretical calculations based on the Cassie's dewetting
   model demonstrate the importance of the hierarchical structure in
   achieving the final superhydrophobic surface states. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A lumped hydrologic model (ACRU2K.1), developed from ACRU2000, was
   extended and evaluated to simulate water dynamics in a plastic mulch
   bedded system for vegetable production under high water table
   environments. The updated model (ACRU2K.2) and ACRU2K.1 were calibrated
   using data collected during the fall 2005 and spring 2006 crop seasons
   of a field study for a vegetable production system in south Florida.
   Both model versions were evaluated using data from the fall 2006 crop
   season. Graphical and statistical methods were applied to evaluate and
   compare the performance of ACRU2K.1 and ACRU2K.2 using observed and
   simulated water table depths (WTD). Graphical analyses showed no added
   advantage in using ACRU2K.2 with its new irrigation process. However,
   the introduction of a drainage process for ACRU2K.2 showed some
   improvement over ACRU2K.1 in simulating changes in the water table. For
   the calibration period, Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NS) values for
   ACRU2K.1 and ACRU2K.2 were 0.73 and 0.65, respectively. However, for the
   evaluation period NS values for ACRU2K.1 and ACRU2K.2 were and ,
   respectively. In general, ACRU2K.1 and ACRU2K.2 underperformed when
   simulating the WTD for plastic mulch bedded systems under high water
   table environments. This was the result of ACRU2000's inability to
   respond correctly to sharp water table fluctuations (within 12h) and is
   a fundamental limitation in its hydrological response time.}},

Abstract = {{Crop growth models dynamically simulate processes of C, N and water
   balance on daily or hourly time-steps to predict crop growth and
   development and at season-end, final yield. Their ability to integrate
   effects of genetics, environment and crop management have led to
   applications ranging from understanding gene function to predicting
   potential impacts of climate change. The history of crop models is
   reviewed briefly, and their level of mechanistic detail for assimilation
   and respiration, ranging from hourly leaf-to-canopy assimilation to
   daily radiation-use efficiency is discussed. Crop models have improved
   steadily over the past 30-40 years, but much work remains. Improvements
   are needed for the prediction of transpiration response to elevated CO2
   and high temperature effects on phenology and reproductive fertility,
   and simulation of root growth and nutrient uptake under stressful
   edaphic conditions. Mechanistic improvements are needed to better
   connect crop growth to genetics and to soil fertility, soil waterlogging
   and pest damage. Because crop models integrate multiple processes and
   consider impacts of environment and management, they have excellent
   potential for linking research from genomics and allied disciplines to
   crop responses at the field scale, thus providing a valuable tool for
   deciphering genotype by environment by management effects.}},

Abstract = {{Cervical spinal cord injury (cSCI) can cause devastating neurological
   deficits, including impairment or loss of upper limb and hand function.
   A majority of the spinal cord injuries in humans occur at the cervical
   levels. Therefore, developing cervical injury models and developing
   relevant and sensitive behavioral tests is of great importance. Here we
   describe the use of a newly developed forelimb step-alternation test
   after cervical spinal cord injury in rats. In addition, we describe two
   behavioral tests that have not been used after spinal cord injury: a
   postural instability test (PIT), and a pasta-handling test. All three
   behavioral tests are highly sensitive to injury and are easy to use.
   Therefore, we feel that these behavioral tests can be instrumental in
   investigating therapeutic strategies after cSCI.}},

Abstract = {{Late leaf spot (LLS) caused by Cercosporidium personatum (Berk. and
   Curt.) Deighton leads to significant reductions in peanut (Arachis
   hypogaea L.) yield worldwide. This study was conducted to improve the
   mechanisms and methods by which LLS effects on defoliation and
   photosynthesis are linked to the CSM-CROPGRO-Peanut model for simulating
   growth and yield reductions in peanut cultivars. Field experiments were
   conducted in 2008 and 2009 to collect data on the effects of LLS on
   biomass accumulation and partitioning, leaf necrosis and defoliation,
   and total canopy photosynthesis (TCP) in peanut cultivars with more
   (York) and less (Carver) quantitative resistance to LLS. After
   incorporating LLS damage as defoliation percentage and necrotic area,
   the model accurately simulated crop growth and development for both
   cultivars despite different disease dynamics. Simulated TCP and leaf,
   total crop, and pod yield values were in good agreement with measured
   data. A modification in the model code to directly reduce leaf
   photosynthesis and quantum efficiency according to empirical
   observations resulted in improved simulations of LLS effects on growth
   and yield. Correlations among measured defoliation and necrotic area
   with disease ratings indicated that visual disease ratings could be
   successfully used to estimate necrosis and defoliation for model inputs.
   Results indicated that the CSM-CROPGRO-Peanut model has adequate
   capability to simulate LLS effects on growth and yield in peanut
   cultivars with differing levels of resistance to LLS when inputs on
   canopy necrotic area and defoliation are provided.}},

Abstract = {{Water stress is one of the crucial factors that determine crop yield
   losses. The Agricultural Reference Index for Drought (ARID) is a generic
   plant water stress index that estimates the level of water stress as the
   ratio of actual evapotranspiration to reference evapotranspiration, on a
   daily time step, considering a hypothetical grass reference crop. The
   objective of this study was to determine the effect of soil inter- and
   intraclass variability, plant characteristics, and climate locations on
   ARID output using global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. Root zone
   depth, maximum uptake factor, the wilting point (theta(wp)), field
   capacity (theta(fc)), drainage coefficient, and runoff curve number were
   the ARID model parameters, while inputs consisted of rainfall and
   reference evapotranspiration. Global sensitivity analysis was performed
   for five locations in the southeastern United States and four soil
   types, sandy loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, and silty clay, using
   three methods, the method of Sobol', partial correlation coefficients,
   and partial rank correlation coefficients. Sensitivity analyses results
   indicated the monotonic and linear nature of ARID. The effect of
   location on the results of this study was minimal. Root zone depth was
   found to be the most influential model parameter, followed by soil
   hydraulic properties (i.e., theta(fc) and theta(wp)). Uncertainty in
   ARID outputs varied from soil to soil (intersoil variability), with
   soils having similar sand content showing similar results. Considerable
   uncertainty was seen in the sandier soils, indicating the need for
   accurate estimation of soil hydraulic properties in such soils.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Experiments are performed on an elliptic circulation control aerofoil in
   an open-jet wind tunnel facility. The influence of blowing from a single
   trailing-edge slot on the external flow is assessed using two-component
   particle image velocimetry (PIV) and steady surface pressure
   measurements. The test section configuration (open jet or closed wall)
   significantly affects the leading-edge region of the flow field. PIV is
   also used to measure the curved wall jet and its interaction with the
   external flow near the trailing edge. PIV measurements of the curved
   wall jet reveal mean tangential velocity similarity in the outer region
   of the flow above the location where the tangential velocity reaches a
   local maximum. The length and velocity parameters required for
   similarity scale with the product of the chord Reynolds number and the
   momentum coefficient in accordance with the recent publication by
   Stalnov, Kribus \& Seifert (J. Renew. Sustain. Energy, vol. 2, 2010, p.
   063101). The separation location is also a function of the product of
   these parameters. The dataset is used to assemble equations to predict
   the similarity length scales, velocity scales and separation location.
   These equations compare well with the present measurements.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores integrated pricing of electricity and roads enabled
   by wireless power transfer technology. We envision that high-power,
   high-efficiency wireless power transfer technologies are mature in the
   near future, which electrify roads to be charging infrastructures. The
   prices of electricity at electrified roads will affect electric
   vehicles' route choices while the energy requirement of those vehicles
   will in return affect the operations of the power network and thus the
   prices of electricity. To determine the optimal prices of electricity
   and roads to maximize social welfare, first- and second-best pricing
   models are proposed under different authoritarian regimes. More
   specifically, assuming that a government agency manages both
   transportation and power systems, we develop the first-best pricing
   model, based on which a marginal-cost pricing scheme is derived. The
   second-best pricing model is proposed if the agency participates in a
   competitive wholesale power market while being able to impose tolls on
   electrified roads. The toll design is formulated as a mathematical
   program with complementarity constraints, and is solved by a manifold
   suboptimization algorithm. Numerical examples are presented to offer
   insights on integrated pricing of roads and electricity and demonstrate
   its effectiveness on improving social welfare. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{54}},
Pages = {{47-56}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A large 1/3-scale model of a light-framed wood structure was constructed
   in order to study the structural reactions to wind loads in a
   three-dimensional model of a residential building. Thirty load cells
   measuring structural reactions at roof-to-wall and wall-to-foundation
   connections were used to determine influence functions in response to
   surface pressures generated by extreme winds. The influence functions
   are used in a database-assisted design (DAD) methodology to estimate
   failure loads in structures subjected to spatio-temporally varying wind
   loads. Current numerical methods based on 2D component models alone can
   lead to underestimated failure loads and inadequate designs. This paper
   describes the approach to develop the physical models and to validate
   their applicability to full-scale houses. Non-dimensional modeling
   techniques are explained, and scale model material properties for
   sheathing, wood-framing members, nails and truss-plate connections are
   provided. The need for a robust experimental method for determining
   influence functions is critical as load distributions are unpredictable
   in these structurally indeterminate systems. Further, the 1/3-scale
   physical models provide an economical approach to generate a large
   dataset of empirically-based models needed to cover a wide variety of
   geometrically complex houses and to calibrate non-linear numerical
   analysis programs for further DAD studies. The approach introduced in
   this study can be applied to more complex roof geometries and also to
   study the combined effects of horizontal and vertical wind load
   distributions in wood buildings. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{41}},

Abstract = {{The propagation of a Boussinesq gravity current which is created by an
   inflow at the bottom of a horizontal rectangular container is
   considered. In particular attention is focused on the front condition of
   the current which is characterized by the Froude number Fr-N =
   u(N)/(g'h(N))(1/2) (where u(N), h(N) are the speed and the height of the
   front, and g' is the reduced gravity). Following a procedure similar to
   the one given in Benjamin (1968){[}1], we have shown that the front
   condition is significantly influenced by the position of the outflow
   boundary (i.e., by the direction of flow of the ambient fluid displaced
   by the current). An expression for the front Froude number (Fr-N) as a
   function of the depth ratio a = h(N)/H, which takes into account the
   direction of the ambient flow, is presented. Two limiting cases are
   considered: no-return ambient flow (when the outflow and inflow are at
   the opposite end walls) and full-return ambient flow (inflow and outflow
   on the same end wall). Theoretical considerations suggest that the
   propagation speed of the gravity current in the no-return configuration
   will be higher than in the classical full-return configuration of
   Benjamin. Navier-Stokes simulations of constant inflow currents in
   no-return configuration were carried out. Overall, the front Froude
   number (Fr-N) evaluated from these simulations conforms to the
   analytical insights and its predictions. Unsteady gravity currents are
   also simulated by implementing time dependent inflow boundary
   conditions. Two sets of simulations were carried out that represent
   accelerating and decelerating currents by implementing waxing
   (increasing in time) and waning (decreasing in time) inflow rates. It is
   observed that the front Froude number (Fr-N) evaluated from the
   simulations of unsteady fronts is in good agreement with the front
   Froude number of a steady front for comparable depth ratio. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This paper presents a quantized kernel least mean square algorithm with
   a fixed memory budget, named QKLMS-FB. In order to deal with the growing
   support inherent in online kernel methods, the proposed algorithm
   utilizes a pruning criterion, called significance measure, based on a
   weighted contribution of the existing data centers. The basic idea of
   the proposed methodology is to discard the center with the smallest
   influence on the whole system, when a new sample is included in the
   dictionary. The significance measure can be updated recursively at each
   step which is suitable for online operation. Furthermore, the proposed
   methodology does not need any a priori knowledge about the data and its
   computational complexity is linear with the center number. Experiments
   show that the proposed algorithm successfully prunes the least
   ``significant{''} centers and preserves the important ones, resulting in
   a compact KLMS model with little loss in accuracy. (c) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Colloids are widely distributed in agricultural runoff, especially from

   to be effective to reduce surface runoff contaminants, including

   were used to determine the influence of physical and chemical factors
   (i.e. solution ionic strength, particle size, surface flow rate, and
   vegetation type) on the surface transport and removal of colloids in a
   dense vegetation system without drainage. Conservative tracer studies of

   the overland flow and soil underneath under various experimental
   conditions. The deposition of colloids enhanced with increases in
   solution ionic strength and particle size, and with decreases in flow
   rate. We also found vegetation type played an important role on colloid
   transport with more deposition onto Ryegrass than onto Bahia grass under
   the same experimental conditions. A mathematical model combining
   overland flow, convection-dispersion equations and exchange layer theory
   was developed to simulate the transport of colloids in overland flow
   through the dense vegetation. Simulations of the model fitted the
   experimental data well and helped to understand the effect of ionic
   strength, particle size, flow rate, and vegetation type on colloid
   transport and removal in dense vegetation. Although additional
   investigations are still needed, findings from this study can inform the
   installation and maintenance of dense vegetation systems, such as
   vegetative filter strips, to reduce the loading of colloids in surface
   runoff. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Beyond Precipitation: Physiographic Gradients Dictate the Relative
   Importance of Environmental Drivers on Savanna Vegetation}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Background: Understanding the drivers of large-scale vegetation change
   is critical to managing landscapes and key to predicting how projected
   climate and land use changes will affect regional vegetation patterns.
   This study aimed to improve our understanding of the role, magnitude and
   spatial distribution of the key environmental factors driving vegetation
   change in southern African savanna, and how they vary across
   physiographic gradients.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We applied Dynamic Factor Analysis
   (DFA), a multivariate times series dimension reduction technique to ten
   years of monthly remote sensing data (MODIS-derived normalized
   difference vegetation index, NDVI) and a suite of environmental
   covariates: precipitation, mean and maximum temperature, soil moisture,
   relative humidity, fire and potential evapotranspiration. Monthly NDVI
   was described by cyclic seasonal variation with distinct spatiotemporal
   patterns in different physiographic regions. Results support existing
   work emphasizing the importance of precipitation, soil moisture and fire
   on NDVI, but also reveal overlooked effects of temperature and
   evapotranspiration, particularly in regions with higher mean annual
   precipitation. Critically, spatial distributions of the weights of
   environmental covariates point to a transition in the importance of
   precipitation and soil moisture (strongest in grass-dominated regions
   with precipitation<750 mm) to fire, potential evapotranspiration, and
   temperature (strongest in tree-dominated regions with precipitation>950
   mm).
   Conclusions/Significance: We quantified the combined spatiotemporal
   effects of an available suite of environmental drivers on NDVI across a
   large and diverse savanna region. The analysis supports known drivers of
   savanna vegetation but also uncovers important roles of temperature and
   evapotranspiration. Results highlight the utility of applying the DFA
   approach to remote sensing products for regional analyses of landscape
   change in the context of global environmental change. With the dramatic
   increase in global change research, this methodology augurs well for
   further development and application of spatially explicit time series
   modeling to studies at the intersection of ecology and remote sensing.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid nanofibers of polyaniline/polyoxometalate are synthesized via a
   facile interfacial polymerization method for the first time, and
   evaluated as a cathode material for lithium ion batteries. The hybrid
   nanofibers with 100 nm diameter consisted of phosphomolybdic acid
   polyanion, {[}PMo12O40](3-), and polyaniline matrix. Their ID geometry
   improves the utilization of electrode materials and accommodates the
   volume change during cycling, which enables the significant improvement
   in lithium storage capacity and capacity retentions. The phosphomolybdic
   acid polyanions not only exhibit a large theoretical capacity of about
   270 mAh g(-1), but also reduce the charge transfer resistance of
   electrode leading to the enhanced reversible capacity and rate
   capability. The polyaniline/polyoxometalate nanofibers delivered a
   remarkably improved electrochemical performance in terms of lithium
   storage capacity (183.4 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C rate), cycling stability
   (80.7\% capacity retention after SO cycles), and rate capability (94.2

Abstract = {{Granger causality is increasingly being applied to multi-electrode
   neurophysiological and functional imaging data to characterize
   directional interactions between neurons and brain regions. For a
   multivariate dataset, one might be interested in different subsets of
   the recorded neurons or brain regions. According to the current
   estimation framework, for each subset, one conducts a separate
   autoregressive model fitting process, introducing the potential for
   unwanted variability and uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a
   multivariate framework for estimating Granger causality. It is based on
   spectral density matrix factorization and offers the advantage that the
   estimation of such a matrix needs to be done only once for the entire
   multivariate dataset. For any subset of recorded data, Granger causality
   can be calculated through factorizing the appropriate submatrix of the
   overall spectral density matrix.}},

Abstract = {{We report three platinum acetylide acrylate monomers containing known
   two-photon absorption (TPA) chromophores and their covalent
   incorporation into polymers via free radical polymerization with methyl
   methacrylate. The photophysical properties of the platinum acetylide
   monomers and resulting poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) copolymers were
   investigated to determine if the one- and two-photon photophysical
   properties of the chromophores were maintained in the copolymers. The
   photophysical properties of the series of copolymers were studied in
   solution and solid state with minimum shifts exhibited in the ground
   state absorption, photoluminescence, and triplet-triplet transient
   absorption spectra. The polymer films displayed markedly stronger
   phosphorescence and longer triplet excited state lifetimes than the
   polymers in solution or the monomers. The incorporation of the platinum
   acetylide chromophores into the PMMA copolymers allows the materials to
   be cast as thin films or into free-standing monoliths. Films with
   similar to 3.6 mu m in thickness and monoliths with 1 mm path length
   were fabricated and examined. The nonlinear absorption responses of the
   polymers in solution were measured via the nanosecond z-scan method, and
   the solid state polymer monoliths were measured via nonlinear
   transmittance. Both measurements indicate that the polymers exhibited
   strong transmittance attenuation at input pulse energies exceeding 100

Abstract = {{AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) with polar and

   channel conductance upon exposure to different concentration of carbon
   monoxide (CO) at room temperature. The ZnO nanowires, grown by chemical
   vapor deposition, with perfect crystal quality will attach CO molecules
   and release electrons, which will lead to a change of surface charge in
   the gate region of the HEMTs, inducing a higher positive charge on the
   AlGaN surface, and increasing the piezo-induced charge density in the
   HEMTs channel. These electrons create an image positive charge on the
   gate region for the required neutrality, thus increasing the drain
   current of the HEMTs. The HEMTs source-drain current was highly
   dependent on the CO concentration. The limit of detection achieved was
   400 ppm and 3200 ppm in the open cavity with continuous gas flow using a

Abstract = {{Correlated Lightning Mapping Array and vertical-scan radar images are
   presented for three rocket-and-wire triggered lightning flashes that
   occurred sequentially within 17min in the presence of a decaying
   multicellular convective storm system over north-central Florida. The
   initial stage (IS) of each flash propagated generally vertically to the
   altitude of the 0 degrees C melting level, about 5km, and then
   subsequently propagated for many kilometers horizontally along the
   melting level contour. Radar images suggest that the propagation paths
   of the IS channels below and above the melting level were heavily
   influenced by precipitation gradients. Flash UF 11-24 exhibited a 12.6km
   unbranched IS channel, the longest unbranched channel observed in the
   study by a factor of three. During flash UF 11-25 (119ms following the
   cessation of the measured IS current at ground and prior to the first
   return stroke), a natural cloud-to-ground discharge, perhaps induced by
   the IS, initiated between 2.5 and 4km altitude and struck ground 5 to
   7km from the launching facility. The IS of flash UF 11-26 propagated
   upward through a descending precipitation packet and apparently induced
   a naturally appearing bi-level intracloud discharge via an
   upward-negative leader that initiated within the IS breakdown region
   3.5km from the launching facility. The upward-negative leader propagated
   from 5.6 to 9.3km altitude in a time of 11ms. The electrical current
   measured at ground during the IS of flash UF 11-26 exhibited a 57ms
   polarity reversal, transferring 19 C of positive charge to ground.}},

Volume = {{266}},
Pages = {{55-63}},

Abstract = {{A series of CexZr1-xO2 nanoparticles were synthesized by reverse micelle
   method that acted bi-functionally as either photocatalysts or free
   radical scavengers. The switch was realized by illumination with light
   at different wavelengths. Dye degradation method was used to evaluate
   their photocatalytic activity compared to Aeroxide (R) TiO2 P25. The
   free radical scavenging capability was examined by photocatalysis of
   mixed particles. Our results demonstrated their ability to effectively
   remove free radicals created by the best photocatalysts in the UV-B
   region. When the excitation wavelength decreased to 302 nm CexZr1-xO2
   nanoparticles acted as photocatalysts. This opens possible applications
   such as selectively killing of the disease cells with bi-functional
   particles using light as a switch. Dark sections will be protective to
   tissues via free radical scavenging while illuminated sections will be
   free radical formers that may cause cell death. Particle
   characterization revealed that the bandgap played a major role in the
   selectivity of light wavelength while bi-functionality should be
   attributed to the exchange between {[}Ce3+] and {[}Ce4+] valence state.
   We also conclude that ceria must be a superior free radical former at
   302 nm compared to titania since it is capable of surpassing its own
   free radical scavenging ability. Further tuning of the bandgap is
   predicted to produce bi-functionality with longer wavelengths. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{We present calculations of the thermal conductivity of fcc Argon at high
   pressures (pressure range is 10-150 GPa, temperatures range is 400-1200
   K) from first principles in the framework of density functional theory
   and solution of the Boltzmann Transport Equation. Local density
   approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA) produce
   similar thermal conductivities, with differences accounted by the known
   overbinding and underbinding of the LDA and GGA, correspondingly.
   Thermal conductivities at all considered pressures and temperatures are
   found to be consistent with the results of previous molecular dynamics
   simulations based on classical 2-body potentials. However, they are not
   consistent with recent experimental findings. Possible reasons for this
   disagreement are discussed. In addition, in light of our calculations,
   we critically examine analytically tractable approximations for thermal
   conductivity as applied to solid argon. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{For a crystal to exhibit nonlinear optical (NLO) activity such as
   second-harmonic generation (SHG), it must belong to a noncentrosymmetric
   (NCS) space group. Moreover, for these nonlinear optical (NLO) materials
   to be suitable for practical uses, the synthesized crystals should be
   phase-matchable (PM). Previous synthetic research into SHG-active
   crystals has centered on (i) how to create NCS compounds and/or (ii) how
   to obtain NCS compounds with high SHG efficiencies. With these tactics,
   one can synthesize a material with a high SHG efficiency, but the
   material could be unusable if the material was nonphase-matchable
   (non-PM). To probe the origin of phase matchability of NCS structures,
   we present two new chemically similar hybrid compounds within one
   composition space: (I) {[}Hdpa](2)NbOF5 center dot 2H(2)O and (II)
   HdpaNbOF(4) (dpa = 2,2'-dipyridylamine). Both compounds are NCS and
   chemically similar, but (I) is non-PM while (II) is PM. Our results
   indicate-consistent with organic crystallography-the arrangement of the
   organic molecule within hybrid materials dictates whether the material
   is PM or non-PM.}},

Title = {{Evaluating ecological resilience with global sensitivity and uncertainty

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MODELLING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{263}},
Pages = {{174-186}},
Month = {{AUG 10}},
Abstract = {{Concern about catastrophic tipping points has motivated inquiry to
   better understand ecosystem dynamics in the presence of human action.
   This requires that we confront multiple challenges in the evaluation of
   complex systems. One challenge is that resilience has proven difficult
   to quantify; another issue is that the value of model complexity
   relative to system complexity is disputed; and finally, local methods
   for assessing uncertainty are inadequate for more complex models. We
   address these three challenges simultaneously by proposing a means of
   evaluating ecological resilience via employment of global sensitivity
   and uncertainty analysis and comparing models of varying complexity. We
   suggest that probability distribution functions in output from global
   sensitivity and uncertainty analysis can be interpreted in terms of
   ball-and-cup diagrams used in systems theory to visualize ecological
   resilience. This permits quantification of ecological resilience in
   terms of the probability of whether a system will remain in a
   pre-existing state or shift to a different state. We outline the methods
   for using global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis to evaluate
   ecological resilience and provide examples from recent research. We
   highlight applications of these methods to assessment of ecosystem
   management options in terms of their ramifications for ecological
   resilience. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A recursive maximum likelihood carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimator
   is proposed in this work, where redundancy information contained in the
   cyclic prefix of multiple consecutive orthogonal frequency-division
   multiplexing (OFDM) symbols is exploited in an efficient recursive
   fashion. Because the estimator is based on multiple OFDM symbols, the
   time-varying CFO must be considered. We investigate the effect of
   time-varying CFO on the performance of the estimator and the trade-off
   between fast tracking ability and low estimation variance. We show that,
   without channel noise, the mean squared error (MSE) of estimation due to
   CFO estimation variation increases approximately quadratically with n,
   where n is the number of OFDM symbols used for CFO estimation
   (estimation window size), whereas the MSE due to channel noise decreases
   proportionally to 1/n (approximately) if the CFO is constant. A
   closed-form expression of the optimal estimation window size
   (approximately) is derived by minimizing the MSE caused by both
   time-varying CFO and channel noise. For wireless systems with
   time-varying rate of change for CFO, the proposed estimator can be
   implemented adaptively. In addition, typical optimal estimation window
   sizes for WiMAX, DVB-SH and MediaFLO systems are evaluated as an
   example. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Effect of Dielectric and Liquid on Plasma Sterilization Using Dielectric
   Barrier Discharge Plasma}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 7}},
Abstract = {{Plasma sterilization offers a faster, less toxic and versatile
   alternative to conventional sterilization methods. Using a relatively
   small, low temperature, atmospheric, dielectric barrier discharge
   surface plasma generator, we achieved >= 6 log reduction in
   concentration of vegetative bacterial and yeast cells within 4 minutes
   and >= 6 log reduction of Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores within
   20 minutes. Plasma sterilization is influenced by a wide variety of
   factors. Two factors studied in this particular paper are the effect of
   using different dielectric substrates and the significance of the amount
   of liquid on the dielectric surface. Of the two dielectric substrates
   tested (FR4 and semi-ceramic (SC)), it is noted that the FR4 is more
   efficient in terms of time taken for complete inactivation. FR4 is more
   efficient at generating plasma as shown by the intensity of spectral
   peaks, amount of ozone generated, the power used and the speed of
   killing vegetative cells. The surface temperature during plasma
   generation is also higher in the case of FR4. An inoculated FR4 or SC
   device produces less ozone than the respective clean devices.
   Temperature studies show that the surface temperatures reached during
   plasma generation are in the range of 30 degrees C-66 degrees C (for
   FR4) and 20 degrees C-49 degrees C (for SC). Surface temperatures during
   plasma generation of inoculated devices are lower than the corresponding
   temperatures of clean devices. pH studies indicate a slight reduction in
   pH value due to plasma generation, which implies that while temperature
   and acidification may play a minor role in DBD plasma sterilization, the
   presence of the liquid on the dielectric surface hampers sterilization
   and as the liquid evaporates, sterilization improves.}},

Title = {{Quantification of Colloid Retention and Release by Straining and Energy
   Minima in Variably Saturated Porous Media}},

Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{8256-8264}},
Month = {{AUG 6}},
Abstract = {{The prediction of colloid transport in unsaturated porous media in the
   presence of large energy barrier is hampered by scant information of the
   proportional retention by straining and attractive interactions at
   surface energy minima. This study aims to fill this gap by performing
   saturated and unsaturated column experiments in which colloid pulses
   were added at various ionic strengths (ISs) from 0.1 to 50 mM.
   Subsequent flushing with deionized water released colloids held at the
   secondary minimum. Next, destruction of the column freed colloids held
   by straining. Colloids not recovered at the end of the experiment were
   quantified as retained at the primary minimum. Results showed that net
   colloid retention increased with IS and was independent of saturation
   degree under identical IS and Darcian velocity. Attachment rates were
   greater in unsaturated columns, despite an over 3-fold increase in pore
   water velocity relative to saturated columns, because additional
   retention at the readily available air-associated interfaces (e.g., the
   air-water-solid {[}AWS] interfaces) is highly efficient. Complementary
   visual data showed heavy retention at the AWS interfaces. Retention by
   secondary minima ranged between 8\% and 46\% as IS increased, and was
   greater for saturated conditions. Straining accounted for an average of
   57\% of the retained colloids with insignificant differences among the
   treatments. Finally, retention by primary minima ranged between 1496 and
   35\% with increasing IS, and was greater for unsaturated conditions due
   to capillary pinning.}},

Abstract = {{This work explored the potential application of an engineered biochar
   prepared from Mg-enriched tomato tissues to reclaim and reuse phosphate
   (P) from aqueous solution. Findings from batch sorption experiments
   suggested that, although sorption of P on the biochar was controlled by
   relatively slow kinetics, the maximum P sorption capacity of the biochar
   could reach >100 mg.g(-1). Mathematical modeling and postsorption
   characterization results indicated that the sorption was mainly
   controlled by two mechanisms: precipitation of P through chemical
   reaction with Mg particles and surface deposition of P on Mg crystals on
   biochar surfaces. Most of the P retained in the engineered biochar was
   bioavailable and could be released equally at multiple successive
   extractions. In addition, the P-laden biochar significantly stimulated
   grass seed germination and growth. These results suggested the
   postsorption biochar can be cycled back directly to soils as an
   effective slow-release P-fertilizer.}},

Abstract = {{Despite nearly 20 years of work on understanding the climate information
   needs of stakeholders and simultaneous development of decision support
   tools, a relatively low level of awareness of specific climate
   information products exists among many water managers in the
   southeastern United States. This paper presents results from an
   assessment of key water management decisions, awareness of, perception
   of, use of, and barriers and opportunities for using climate information
   among water managers in Alabama, Florida, and Georgia. Through an online
   survey, we collected data from 141 water managers across the region. Our
   findings reveal that water managers surveyed, for the most part, are
   unaware of most sources of seasonal climate forecasts as well as
   specific sources of long-term climate change information. From our
   analysis, we found that the use of seasonal climate forecast products
   remains mostly in the realm of water managers with high levels of
   expertise and training generally employed at large water management
   agencies. In addition to limited awareness, some reasons for nonuse are
   lack of understanding of forecasts and limitations in temporal and
   spatial scales of available climate information. We conclude with
   recommendations on how our findings can be used to align goals of
   climate science research by ensuring that it is relevant to
   decision-makers' needs and decisions and by identifying opportunities
   for improvements in forecast dissemination and climate risk management.
   For example, the need for more interactions among scientists and
   decision-makers, and the identification of opportunities within the
   decision-making frameworks where climate information can be input are
   manifest throughout the study.}},

Abstract = {{Crop models are one of the most commonly used tools to assess the impact
   of climate variability and change on crop production. However, before
   the impact of projected climate changes on crop production can be
   addressed, a necessary first step is the assessment of the inherent
   uncertainty and limitations of the forcing data used in these crop
   models. In this paper, we evaluate the simulated crop production using
   separate crop models for maize (summer crop) and wheat (winter crop)
   over six different locations in the Southeastern United States forced
   with multiple sources of actual and simulated weather data. The paper
   compares the crop production simulated by a crop model for maize and
   wheat during a historical period, using daily weather data from three
   sources: station observations, dynamically downscaled global reanalysis,
   and dynamically downscaled historical climate model simulations from two
   global circulation models (GCMs). The same regional climate model is
   used to downscale the global reanalysis and both global circulation
   models' historical simulation. The average simulated yield derived from
   bias-corrected downscaled reanalysis or bias-corrected downscaled GCMs
   were, in most cases, not statistically different from observations.
   Statistical differences of the average yields, generated from observed
   or downscaled GCM weather, were found in some locations under rainfed
   and irrigated scenarios, and more frequently in winter (wheat) than in
   summer (maize). The inter-annual variance of simulated crop yield using
   GCM downscaled data was frequently overestimated, especially in summer.
   An analysis of the bias-corrected climate data showed that despite the
   agreement between the modeled and the observed means of temperatures,
   solar radiation, and precipitation, their intra-seasonal variances were
   often significantly different from observations. Therefore, due to this
   high intra-seasonal variability, a cautious approach is required when
   using climate model data for historical yield analysis and future
   climate change impact assessments.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to evaluate the ability of dynamically
   downscaled reanalysis data to reproduce local-scale spatiotemporal
   precipitation and temperature data needed to accurately predict
   streamflow in the Tampa Bay region of west central Florida. In
   particular, the Florida State University Center for Ocean-Atmospheric
   Prediction Studies CLARReS10 data (NCEP DOE 2 reanalysis data (R2)
   downscaled to 10-km over the Southeast USA using the Regional Spectral
   Model (RSM) were evaluated against locally available observed
   precipitation and temperature data and then used to drive an integrated
   hydrologic model that was previously calibrated for the Tampa Bay
   region. Resulting streamflow simulations were evaluated against observed
   data and previously calibrated model results. Results showed that the
   raw downscaled reanalysis predictions accurately reproduced the seasonal
   trends of mean daily minimum temperature, maximum temperature and
   precipitation, but generally overestimated the monthly mean and standard
   deviation of daily precipitation. Biases in the temporal mean and
   standard deviation of daily precipitation and temperature predictions
   were effectively removed using a CDF-mapping approach; however, errors
   in monthly precipitation totals remained after bias correction. Monthly
   streamflow simulation error statistics indicated that the accuracy of
   the streamflow produced by the bias-corrected downscaled reanalysis data
   was satisfactory (i.e., sufficient for seasonal to decadal planning),
   but that the accuracy of the streamflow produced by the raw downscaled
   reanalysis data was unsatisfactory for water resource planning purposes.
   The findings of this study thus indicate that further improvement in
   large-scale reanalysis data and regional climate models is needed before
   dynamically downscaled reanalysis data can be used directly (i.e.
   without bias correction with local data) to drive hydrologic models.
   However, bias-corrected dynamically downscaled data show promise for
   extending local historic climate observation records for hydrologic
   simulations. Furthermore, results of this study indicate that similarly
   bias-corrected dynamically downscaled retrospective and future GCM
   projections should be suitable for assessing potential hydrologic
   impacts of future climate change in the Tampa Bay region.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of experiments to characterize the turbulence in the
   surface layer have been performed in flat, open expanses. In order to
   characterize the turbulence in built-up terrain, two mobile towers were
   deployed during Hurricane Ike (2008) in close proximity, but downwind of
   different terrain conditions: suburban and open. Due to the significant
   non-stationarity of the data primarily caused by changes in wind
   direction, empirical mode decomposition was employed to de-trend the
   signal. Analysis of the data showed that the along-wind mean turbulence
   intensity of the suburban terrain was 37\% higher than that of the open
   terrain. For the mean vertical turbulence intensity, the increase for
   the suburban terrain was as high as 74\%, which may have important
   implications in structural engineering. The gust factor of the suburban
   terrain was also 16\% higher than that of the open terrain. Compared to
   non-hurricane spectral models, the obtained spectra showed significantly
   higher energy in low frequencies especially for the open terrain.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to investigate the vulnerability of roof tile
   systems and metal shutters to roof tile debris. Three phases addressed
   the performance of tile roof systems and metal shutters impacted by roof
   tile debris. The first phase experimentally evaluated the tile fragment
   size and quantity generated by a tile striking a tile roof system. The
   second phase experimentally quantified the puncture vulnerability of
   common metal panel shutter systems as a function of tile fragment impact
   speed. The third phase provided context for interpretation of the
   experimental results through the use of a tile trajectory model. The
   results provide supporting evidence that while metal panel window
   shutters provide significant protection against a prevalent form of
   windborne debris, these systems are vulnerable to tile fragment puncture
   in design level tropical cyclones. These findings correlate with field
   observations made after Hurricane Charley (2004).}},

Title = {{A Three-Stage Procurement Optimization Problem under Uncertainty}},
Journal = {{NAVAL RESEARCH LOGISTICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{395-412}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This article examines a problem faced by a firm procuring a material
   input or good from a set of suppliers. The cost to procure the material
   from any given supplier is concave in the amount ordered from the
   supplier, up to a supplier-specific capacity limit. This NP-hard problem
   is further complicated by the observation that capacities are often
   uncertain in practice, due for instance to production shortages at the
   suppliers, or competition from other firms. We accommodate this
   uncertainty in a worst-case (robust) fashion by modeling an adversarial
   entity (which we call the follower) with a limited procurement budget.
   The follower reduces supplier capacity to maximize the minimum cost
   required for our firm to procure its required goods. To guard against
   uncertainty, the firm can protect any supplier at a cost (e.g., by
   signing a contract with the supplier that guarantees supply
   availability, or investing in machine upgrades that guarantee the
   supplier's ability to produce goods at a desired level), ensuring that
   the anticipated capacity of that supplier will indeed be available. The
   problem we consider is thus a three-stage game in which the firm first
   chooses which suppliers' capacities to protect, the follower acts next
   to reduce capacity from unprotected suppliers, and the firm then
   satisfies its demand using the remaining capacity. We formulate a
   three-stage mixed-integer program that is well-suited to decomposition
   techniques and develop an effective cutting-plane algorithm for its
   solution. The corresponding algorithmic approach solves a sequence of
   scaled and relaxed problem instances, which enables solving problems
   having much larger data values when compared to standard techniques. (c)

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic field-assisted finishing (MAF) is used to polish free-form
   surfaces. The material removal mechanism can be described as a flexible
   ``magnetic brush{''} that consists of ferromagnetic particles and
   abrasives that arrange themselves in the working gap between the magnet
   and the workpiece. Relative motion between the brush and the workpiece
   causes microcutting and improves surface finish. In this study, the
   contributions of the magnetic and polishing force components to the
   total force were evaluated. The effect of varying the polishing
   conditions, such as the working gap and the size of the ferromagnetic
   iron particles, on polishing forces, surface roughness, and material
   removal rate was also analyzed. It was observed that the polishing
   forces varied considerably with working gap. Also, the iron particle
   size was found to have a strong relation to the rate at which the
   surface roughness improved. Surface roughness values of 2-3 nm were
   achieved.}},

Title = {{The Faraday threshold in small cylinders and the sidewall non-ideality}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{729}},
Pages = {{496-523}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In this work we investigate, by way of experiments and theory, the
   Faraday instability threshold in cylinders at low frequencies. This
   implies large wavelengths where effects from mode discretization cannot
   be ignored. Careful selection of the working fluids has resulted in an
   immiscible interface whose apparent contact line with the sidewall can
   glide over a tiny film of the more wetting fluid, without detachment of
   its actual contact line. This unique behaviour has allowed for a system
   whose primary dissipation is defined by the bulk viscous effects, and in
   doing so, for the first time, close connection is seen with the viscous
   linear stability theory for which a stress-free condition is assumed at
   the sidewalls. As predicted, mode selection and co-dimension 2 points
   are observed in the experiment for a frequency range including
   subharmonic, harmonic, and superharmonic modes. While agreement with the
   predictions are generally excellent, there are deviations from the
   theory for certain modes and these are explained in the context of
   harmonic meniscus waves. A review of previous work on single-mode
   excitation in cylinders is given, along with comparison to the viscous
   model and analysis based upon the conclusions of the current
   experiments.}},
