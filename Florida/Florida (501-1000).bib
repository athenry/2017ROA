Abstract = {{Successful diagnostic and prognostic stratification, treatment outcome
   prediction, and therapy planning depend on reproducible and accurate
   pathology analysis. Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) is a useful tool to
   help doctors make better decisions in cancer diagnosis and treatment.
   Accurate cell detection is often an essential prerequisite for
   subsequent cellular analysis. The major challenge of robust brain tumor
   nuclei/cell detection is to handle significant variations in cell
   appearance and to split touching cells. In this paper, we present an
   automatic cell detection framework using sparse reconstruction and
   adaptive dictionary learning. The main contributions of our method are:
   1) A sparse reconstruction based approach to split touching cells; 2) An
   adaptive dictionary learning method used to handle cell appearance
   variations. The proposed method has been extensively tested on a data
   set with more than 2000 cells extracted from 32 whole slide scanned
   images. The automatic cell detection results are compared with the
   manually annotated ground truth and other state-of-the-art cell
   detection algorithms. The proposed method achieves the best cell
   detection accuracy with a F-1 score = 0.96.}},

Title = {{Respiration Rate Measurement Under 1-D Body Motion Using Single

Abstract = {{Random body movement (RBM) is one of the most challenging issues in
   non-contact vital sign detection using Doppler radar technique. The
   large and irregular displacement of the human body could corrupt the
   vital sign signal and significantly degrade the accuracy of detection.
   Even the respiration rate (RR) sometimes cannot be measured accurately
   under RBM. In this paper, the characteristic of the frequency spectrum
   of the vital sign signal under body motion (the motion modulation
   effect) is analyzed. Based on that effect, an RR measurement method
   under one-dimensional (1-D) body motion is developed using only one
   non-contact continuous-wave (CW) Doppler radar vital sign detection
   system. The direction of body motion is extracted along with the new
   position of the respiration peaks in the frequency spectrum and RR can
   be calculated. Simulations of the theory using a model of the vital sign
   detection system are performed, followed by experiments to verify the
   theory. Experiments are performed on an actuator and a human subject by
   only one 5.8-GHz non-contact CW vital sign detection system. Under large
   1-D body motion that has a displacement 5-10 times larger than the
   respiratory displacement, the proposed method successfully measures RR
   with only 7.15\% error.}},

Abstract = {{Time-of-flight (TOF) and coincident scattering measurements were
   conducted to measure the light response of a pressurized 4 He fast
   neutron scintillation detector as a function of deposited energy up to 5
   MeV. The energy deposited in the detector by a neutron was measured by
   its angle of scatter and compared to the resulting light output. Whereas
   previous research has exclusively focussed on the energy information
   contained in the slow component, this work demonstrates that the fast
   component is also sensitive to neutron energy, and the entire
   scintillation signal can therefore be used. The gamma rejection
   capability of the detector was also measured for a variety of gamma
   sources. The detector demonstrated a inherent gamma rejection rate of
   97.31\%, which was increased to 99.89\% after the application of pulse
   shape discrimination (PSD) algorithms. The characterization of gamma
   rejection and light response parameters will enable implementation of
   these detectors for neutron spectroscopy in mixed radiation fields.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPOSITES FOR CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2016}},

Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Externally bonded fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites are becoming
   a method of choice for the repair/strengthening of civil structures,
   some of which are situated in environments detrimental to FRP-concrete
   bond durability. Based on analysis of an extensive database of
   durability test results from notched-beam three-point bending tests, a
   bond durability factor (BDF) of 0.60 was identified as an appropriate
   estimate of bond durability for wet-layup carbon fiber-reinforced
   polymer (CFRP). This factor was compared to a normalized database of
   durability data from the literature, and it was found that a 0.60 BDF
   agrees well with these data. A modified procedure for determining the
   ultimate design strain primarily in bond-critical applications (such as
   external flexural and shear FRP reinforcement), is proposed. This
   procedure makes a distinction between durability properties associated
   with the FRP rupture and debonding failure modes. When used for
   practically feasible strengthening ratios and in conjunction with BDF of
   0.60, the proposed procedure yields overall ultimate flexural-member
   design strengths that are 0-15\% lower than those determined using
   current design procedures. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

   feature of the method is that any flow control in the original function
   code is preserved in the derivative code. Furthermore, the resulting
   derivative code relies solely upon the native MATLAB library. The method
   is useful in applications where it is required to repeatedly evaluate
   the derivative of the original function. The approach is demonstrated on
   several examples and is found to be highly efficient when compared to

Abstract = {{A completely integrated 3.3 V to 10 Vpk-pk bidirectional
   switched-capacitor ladder converter is presented for driving the piezo
   actuators of a 2 mm wing micro-robotic flying insect. The 0.1-10 MHz
   converter, fabricated in 1.2 V/3.3 V triple-well 0.13 mu m CMOS,
   operates as a switched-mode amplifier with 0-3.3 V waveforms at the
   input and a constant 3x step-up while exhibiting symmetric drive
   strength for positive and negative load currents. A feedforward
   switching scheme that effectively bootstraps gate-drive signals for the
   power switches of the ladder converter has been implemented to enable
   output waveforms above both the supply and device voltage rating,
   between 0 V and similar to 10 V. Non-overlapping clock signals float
   with the dc-500 Hz arbitrary input waveform, or a 2x scaled replica,
   while keeping all transistors within safe operating conditions. A
   voltage compliant sub-circuit, the Nested-Bootstrapped Switch (NBS)
   cell, is introduced as a building block for the creation of the
   gate-drive signals. On-chip MIM capacitors and 3.3 V I/O MOS switches
   for the ladder converter were sized based on a charge-multiplier
   representation of the converter and the output impedance concept.
   Experiments show actuation of a 2 mm wing prototype, an effective 5 nF
   peak load, and efficiency of 77\% at 800 mu W and 80\% at 32 mu W.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the conjugate heat and mass transfer process taking place
   during the absorption of a refrigerant vapor into a falling liquid film
   is analyzed using the Laplace transform method. The Laplace transform
   method has been previously utilized to model the process but under a
   uniform velocity profile assumption. Here, a more realistic linear
   velocity profile is employed. The results suggest that the uniform
   velocity profile assumption overestimates the refrigerant concentration
   across the liquid film, and underestimates the temperature profile and
   the vapor absorption rate. Overall, the uniform velocity profile
   assumption can result in up to 30\% error in calculating the absorption
   rate. Using the new model, the effect of different flow parameters on
   the absorption rate has been studied. The efficacy of the model is
   demonstrated through comparison with various experimental and numerical
   results reported in the literature. The analytical solution developed in
   the present study provides a simple, fast and accurate approach for
   calculating the absorption rate at different operating conditions and
   fluid properties. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

   poly(beta-thioester)s is reported. Aliphatic azo linkages were
   incorporated into the main chain of the polymers to allow for
   degradation to lower molecular weights upon heating. These polymers
   displayed a temperature-dependent degradation profile with a significant
   increase in decomposition rate as the temperature was raised from 60 to
   95 degrees C. This approach was further extended to prepare amphiphilic
   triblock copolymers containing poly(beta-thioester)s and poly(ethylene
   glycol) (PEG). The resulting block copolymers were capable of self
   assembly into micelles in water. Moreover, the assembled nanoparticles
   underwent dissociation as a result of exposure to heat.}},

Abstract = {{The 7m-wide Canal Oeste passes over a series of first-order,
   intermittent streams on hillsides on its way to irrigate the lowlands of
   Guanacaste, Costa Rica. Streams passing under lined portions of the
   canal have maintained intermittent flow, while those under unlined
   portions of the canal have become perennial, thus providing a unique
   opportunity to examine the impact of drastically altered hydrology on
   macroinvertebrate communities of dry forest streams. Macroinvertebrates
   were studied from the end of the dry season through a wet season.
   Macroinvertebrate recolonization of intermittent streams at the
   beginning of the wet season was rapid, led by small bodied taxa such as
   chironomids and oligochaetes with short life cycles and/or great
   tolerance for low oxygen and spates. As additional, less tolerant taxa
   arrived, most likely aerially from adjacent perennial streams, the fauna
   of intermittent streams progressively became similar to that of
   perennial streams of the area within 3-4months of rewetting. The great
   resilience of the macroinvertebrate community is clearly demonstrated by
   its ability to adjust with few modifications to a complete switch from
   intermittent to perennial hydroperiod. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Extreme learning machine (ELM) techniques have received considerable
   attention in the computational intelligence and machine learning
   communities because of the significantly low computational time required
   for training new classifiers. ELM provides solutions for regression,
   clustering, binary classification, multiclass classifications and so on,
   but not for multi-label learning. Multi-label learning deals with
   objects having multiple labels simultaneously, which widely exist in
   real-world applications. Therefore, a thresholding method-based ELM is
   proposed in this paper to adapt ELM to multi-label classification,
   called extreme learning machine for multi-label classification (ELM-ML).
   ELM-ML outperforms other multi-label classification methods in several
   standard data sets in most cases, especially for applications which only
   have a small labeled data set.}},

   capacity of the spliced specimens exceeded the calculated shear strength
   calculated per modified compression field theory and per the traditional

Abstract = {{A ``walker{''} tool was developed to assist successful placement of
   Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae) adults at predetermined
   sites on citrus (Sapindales: Rutaceae) trees in behavioral bioassays.
   Use of the walker resulted in a significantly higher proportion of
   successful placements and a significantly lower number of jumps away
   from the predetermined site compared with the use of a brush, although
   on average it required an additional 108 s more than the 41 s required
   with the brush to complete a successful placement. Females and males
   performed similarly with both devices. Potentially, the walker is a
   useful placement tool under conditions where it is time and labor
   intensive to provide large numbers of insects with specific
   physiological characteristics for testing, e.g., when it is difficult to
   supply large numbers of D. citri adults of known sex, mating status, and
   age. Because phototaxis is commonly observed in psyllids, the walker may
   be of use also for bioassays with other economic pests such as
   Bactericera cockerelli (Sulc) (Hemiptera: Triozidae).}},

Abstract = {{When converting voxel phantoms to a surface format, the small intestine
   ( SI), which is usually not accurately represented in a voxel phantom
   due to its complex and irregular shape on one hand and the limited voxel
   resolutions on the other, cannot be directly converted to a high-quality
   surface model. Currently, stylized pipe models are used instead, but
   they are strongly influenced by developer's subjectivity, resulting in
   unacceptable geometric and dosimetric inconsistencies. In this paper, we
   propose a new method for the construction of SI models based on the
   Monte Carlo approach. In the present study, the proposed method was
   tested by constructing the SI model for the polygon-mesh version of the
   ICRP reference male phantom currently under development. We believe that
   the new SI model is anatomically more realistic than the stylized SI
   models. Furthermore, our simulation results show that the new SI model,
   for both external and internal photon exposures, leads to dose values
   that are more similar to those of the original ICRP male voxel phantom
   than does the previously constructed stylized SI model.}},

Abstract = {{Mg-Fe layered double hydroxide (MgFe-LDH) particles were incorporated
   into wheat-straw biochar by liquid-phase deposition. The obtained
   biochar/MgFe-LDH composite was used to remove nitrate from aqueous
   solutions. X-ray diffraction patterns demonstrated that LDH particles
   were successfully deposited onto the carbon surface within the biochar
   matrix. Adsorption kinetic and isotherm studies and the effects of
   co-existing anions and adsorbents dosages were investigated using
   laboratory batch sorption experiments. The biochar/MgFe-LDH composite
   showed a strong sorption ability to nitrate in aqueous solutions with
   the Langmuir maximum adsorption capacity of 24.8 mg/g. A high
   selectivity for nitrate of the biochar/MgFe-LDH composite was also
   observed irrespective of the co-existence of sulfate and phosphate. The
   biochar/MgFe-LDH composite can thus be potentially used as an
   alternative adsorbent for the treatment of nitrate-contaminated waters
   as well as a soil amendment for the reduction of soil nitrate leaching.

Abstract = {{In most mammals and a rare few reptilian lineages the evolution of
   precise dental occlusion led to the capacity to form functional chewing
   surfaces due to pressures generated while feeding. The complex dental
   architectures of such teeth and the biomechanics of their self-wearing
   nature are poorly understood. Our research team composed of
   paleontologists, evolutionary biologists, and engineers have developed a
   protocol to: (1) determine the histological make-up of grinding
   dentitions in extant and fossil taxa; (2) ascertain wear-relevant
   material properties of the tissues; (3) determine how those properties
   relate to inter-tissue-biomechanics leading the dental functionality
   using a three-dimensional Archard's wear model developed specifically
   for dental applications; (4) analyze those data in phylogenetic contexts
   to infer evolutionary patterns as they relate to feeding. Finally we
   discuss industrial applications that are emerging from our
   paleontologically-inspired research.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a genetic algorithm based autotuning strategy in this paper.
   Autotuning is a platform independent code optimization process in which
   different hardware and software parameters of the code being optimized
   are identified and the parameter space explored to arrive at an
   alternative implementation that optimizes characteristics such as
   performance and energy consumption. The main advantage of our approach
   is that the number of possible compilations and executions that are
   explored in the configuration space is substantially smaller than
   exhaustive search. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach to the
   underlying small matrix multiplication routines in spectral element
   solvers. The latter are an important class of higher order methods that
   are expected to be computationally intensive portion of the next
   generation of large scale CFD simulations. Our experimental results were
   conducted on a variety of existing platforms as well as on gem5
   simulator platform with different cache configurations. On an existing
   platform, AMD Fusion, the genetic algorithm is able obtain 34\%
   improvement in performance and 37\% reduction in energy consumption over
   existing versions of the code. The fact that a very small fraction of
   the entire configuration space needs to be explored becomes very useful
   as algorithmic exploration is combined with exploration of cache
   configuration resulting in hardware/software co-optimization. We used
   the micro-architectural simulator, gem5, to evaluate different cache
   configurations for energy and performance trade-offs for out-of-order
   x86 cores at the micro-architectural level for small matrix
   multiplications. Our results show how genetic algorithm based autotuning
   strategy can come up with a close to optimal variant analyzing only
   about 0.25\% of the exploration space. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Objective: Calculate mortality risk that accounts for both severity and
   recovery of postoperative kidney dysfunction using the pattern of
   longitudinal change in creatinine.
   Background: Although the importance of renal recovery after acute kidney
   injury (AKI) is increasingly recognized, the complex association that
   accounts for longitudinal creatinine changes and mortality is not fully
   described.
   Methods: We used routinely collected clinical information for 46,299
   adult patients undergoing major surgery to develop a multivariable
   probabilistic model optimized for nonlinearity of serum creatinine time
   series that calculates the risk function for 90-day mortality. We
   performed a 70/30 cross validation analysis to assess the accuracy of
   the model.
   Results: All creatinine time series exhibited nonlinear risk function in
   relation to 90-day mortality and their addition to other clinical
   factors improved the model discrimination. For any given severity of
   AKI, patients with complete renal recovery, as manifested by the return
   of the discharge creatinine to the baseline value, experienced a
   significant decrease in the odds of dying within 90 days of admission
   compared with patients with partial recovery. Yet, for any severity of
   AKI, even complete renal recovery did not entirely mitigate the
   increased odds of dying, as patients with mild AKI and complete renal
   recovery still had significantly increased odds for dying compared with
   patients without AKI {[}odds ratio: 1.48 (95\% confidence interval:
   1.30-1.68)].
   Conclusions: We demonstrate the nonlinear relationship between both
   severity and recovery of renal dysfunction and 90-day mortality after
   major surgery. We have developed an easily applicable computer algorithm
   that calculates this complex relationship.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Physician empathy is a complex phenomenon known to improve
   illness outcomes; however, few tools are available for deliberate
   practice of empathy. We used a virtual patient (VP) to teach empathic
   communication to first-year medical students. We then evaluated
   students' verbal empathy in a standardized patient (SP) interaction.
   Methods: Seventy medical students, randomly assigned to 3 separate study
   groups, interacted with (1) a control VP portraying depression, (2) a VP
   with a backstory simulating patient shadowing, or (3) a VP able to give
   immediate feedback about empathic communication (empathy-feedback VP).
   Subsequently, the students interviewed an SP portraying a scenario that
   included opportunities to express empathy. All SP interviews were
   recorded and transcribed. The study outcomes were (1) the students'
   verbal response to the empathic opportunities presented by the SP, as
   coded by reliable assessors using the Empathic Communication Coding
   System, and (2) the students' responses as coded by the SPs, using a
   communication checklist.
   Results: There were no significant differences in student demographics
   between groups. The students who interacted with the empathy-feedback VP
   showed higher empathy in the SP interview than did the students in the
   backstory VP and the control VP groups {[}mean (SD) empathy scores coded
   on a 0-6 scale were 2.91 (0.16) vs. 2.20 (0.22) and 2.27 (0.21),
   respectively). The difference in scores was significant only for the
   empathy-feedback VP versus the backstory VP group (P = 0.027). The SPs
   rated the empathy-feedback and the backstory VP groups significantly
   higher than the control VP group on offering empathic statements (P <
   0.0001), appearing warm and caring (P = 0.015), and forming rapport (P =
   0.004).
   Conclusions: Feedback on empathy in a VP interaction increased students'
   empathy in encounters with SPs, as rated by trained assessors, whereas a
   simulation of patient shadowing did not. Both VP interventions increased
   students' empathy as rated by SPs, compared with the control VP group.}},

Abstract = {{Recognition and detection of green immature citrus fruit more accurately
   and efficiently in groves under natural illumination conditions provides
   a promising benefit for growers to plan application of nutrients during
   the fruit maturing stages and estimate their yield and profit prior to
   the harvesting period. The goal of this study was to develop a robust
   and fast algorithm to detect and count immature green citrus fruit in
   individual trees from colour images acquired with different fruit sizes
   and under various illumination conditions. Adaptive Red and Blue
   chromatic map (ARB) was created and combined with the Hue image
   extracted after histogram equalization (HEH). The sum of absolute
   transformed difference (SATD), a block-matching method, was applied to
   detect potential fruit pixels. After OR operation of the results
   obtained from colour and SATD analysis which kept as many fruit pixels
   as possible, a kernel support vector machine (SVM) classifier was built
   with same learning sets used for different classification stages to
   remove false positives based on five selected texture features. The
   algorithm was evaluated with a set of testing images, and achieved more
   than 83\% recognition accuracy. The proposed method can provide a more
   efficient way for green citrus identification in a grove using colour
   images. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) and pervasive and
   ubiquitous computing provide a glimpse into the future of our planet and
   reveal exciting visions of many smart things: smart cities, smart homes,
   smart cars, and other smart spaces such as malls, workplaces, hotels,
   schools, and much more. Driven by a technological revolution offering
   ``low-power many things and wireless almost everything,{''} we could, in
   only a decade, envision and prototype impressive smart space systems
   that improve quality of life, enhance awareness of resources and the
   environment, and enrich users' experience. However, prototyping is one
   thing and actual large-scale deployments are another. The massive scale
   of sensors and devices that will be deployed in smart cities of the
   future will be challenging. Without an ecosystem and a scalable
   architecture in place, it will be extremely difficult to manage or
   program such an expanding and massive IoT. In this paper, we introduce
   the Cloud-Edge-Beneath (CEB) architecture and present its salient
   scalability features. We also present a validation study based on an
   event-driven programming model demonstrating CEB's scaling behavior in
   face of IoT expansion and under dynamically increasing loads.}},

Abstract = {{The Aerodynamic Characterization Facility is a unique facility located
   at the University of Florida's Research and Engineering Education
   Facility designed with the intent to study complex low Reynolds number,
   unsteady aerodynamic phenomena. This facility includes an open jet, open
   return wind tunnel specifically designed to operate in the low Reynolds
   number regime where current research efforts are being tasked for Micro
   Air Vehicle flight platforms. Specifically, the wind tunnel operates
   with freestream velocities ranging from nominally 0 to 22 m/s with 0.1
   m/s resolution provided by a variable frequency drive utilized to
   control the tunnel. The test section entrance is 1.07 m(2) with a length
   of 4.6 m. Flow uniformity investigations at free stream velocities of 2
   and 4 m/s demonstrate a uniform flow core throughout the test section of
   at least 50\% of the 1.14 m(2) contraction exit. Hot wire anemometry
   investigations present turbulence intensities less than 0.22\% for free
   stream velocities greater than 1 m/s. The facility is also equipped with
   a dynamic motion rig and active turbulence generator. The dynamic motion
   rig is utilized to investigate unsteady aerodynamics over dynamic
   kinematic motions similar to what one might find in small birds and
   insects. The active turbulence generator provides a means to introduce
   atmospheric-like turbulence into the wind tunnel to understand the
   coupling between turbulence and unsteady flow phenomena associated with
   bird and insect flight.}},

Abstract = {{Ketotifen an anti-allergic drug delivered via eye drops has major
   limitations, including poor ocular bioavailability and poor patient
   compliance. The objective of the research work was to fabricate
   ketotifen loaded microemulsion laden hydrogels and silica shell
   nanoparticle-laden (prepared from microemulsion using
   octyltrimethoxysilane) hydrogels to achieve extended ocular drug
   delivery. The porous silica shell membrane was synthesized at the liquid
   interface of microemulsion, which facilitates the prolongation of drug
   release duration from hydrogels. Drug encapsulated microemulsion and
   silica shell nanoparticles were dispersed separately in premonomer
   mixture, and fabricated to hydrogel. For comparison, hydrogel with
   direct drug entrapment was also fabricated. Significant loss in
   transmittance and physical properties was observed in hydrogels with
   direct drug entrapment. While, microemulsion and silica shell
   nanoparticle-laden hydrogels did not show significant effect on
   transmittance and physical properties. The in vitro drug release data
   showed extended release of ketotifen from hydrogels in following order:
   direct loading\textbackslash{}microemulsion\textbackslash{}silica shell
   nanoparticles. The results of cytotoxicity and animal study confirmed
   the safety of hydrogels. The in vivo pharmacokinetic study showed
   extended ketotifen release for more than 10 days. The results
   demonstrated the translational potential of silica shell nanoparticles
   for extended drug delivery without compromising the critical lens
   properties.

   gasification of municipal solid waste}},
Journal = {{WASTE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {{169-179}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Slag from the high temperature arc gasification (HTAG) of municipal
   solid waste (MSW) was tested to evaluate its material properties with
   respect to use as a construction aggregate. These data were compared to
   previously compiled values for waste to energy bottom ash, the most
   commonly produced and beneficially used thermal treatment residue. The
   slag was tested using gradations representative of a base course and a
   course aggregate. Los Angeles (LA) abrasion testing demonstrated that
   the HTAG slag had a high resistance to fracture with a measured LA loss
   of 24\%. Soundness testing indicated a low potential for reactivity and
   good weathering resistance with a mean soundness loss of 3.14\%. The
   modified Proctor compaction testing found the slag to possess a maximum
   dry density (24.04 kN/m(3)) greater than conventionally used aggregates
   and WTE BA. The LBR tests demonstrated a substantial bearing capacity
   (>200). Mineralogical analysis of the HTAG suggested the potential for
   self cementing character which supports the elevated LBR results.
   Preliminary material characterization of the HTAG slag establishes
   potential for beneficial use; larger and longer term studies focusing on
   the material's possibility for swelling and performance at the field
   scale level are needed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Simulating cultivar variations in potato yields for contrasting
   environments}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{145}},
Pages = {{51-63}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Potato (Solanum tuberosum L) is a major food commodity becoming
   increasingly important for food security, especially in the developing
   world. The rising demand for potatoes combined with yield gaps and
   potential adverse impacts from climate change call' for strategies for
   yield improvement and environmental adaptation. Crop growth models can
   help identify and assess such strategies. In this study, the SUBSTOR
   potato model was used in a systematic assessment of all cultivar
   parameters in the model in a range of environments including temperate,
   subtropical, and tropical regions to identify options for future crop
   improvement and to develop strategies for climate change adaptation in
   potato production. Our results show that yield responses to changes in
   cultivar parameters are specific to the environment. Some changes are
   less effective in subtropical and tropical environments and more
   effective in increasing yields in temperate environments. Solar
   radiation, day length, and temperature are the environmental factors
   that constrain the effectiveness of cultivar parameters in changing
   yields. The simulated variation in yields among environments was larger
   than the variation from changes in cultivar parameters. The impact of
   cultivar parameter changes on yield also varied with the cultivar
   parameter. The potential tuber growth rate was the cultivar parameter
   with the strongest effect on yields. Changes in the potential tuber
   growth rate parameter can lead to large yield changes in tropical
   highlands and temperate environments that have high solar radiation to
   ensure sufficient assimilate production for a larger sink. Results also
   suggest that improving crop management (e.g., N input) is more important
   for increasing yields than the potential in cultivar improvement. The
   study showed that crop modeling can help assess alternative strategies
   of yield improvement and support targeting and prioritization of efforts
   to improve crop productivity across different environments, based on an
   improved understanding of genotype by environment by management
   interactions. Results also showed how crop models can yield insights
   relevant for climate change adaptation even when only using weather data
   of the current climate. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nemaline myopathies (NMs) are a group of congenital muscle diseases
   caused by mutations in at least 10 genes and associated with a range of
   clinical symptoms. NM is defined on muscle biopsy by the presence of
   cytoplasmic rod-like structures (nemaline rods) composed of cytoskeletal
   material. Myofiber smallness is also found in many cases of NM and may
   represent a cause of weakness that can be counteracted by treatment. We
   have used i.p. injection of activin type IIB receptor (ActRIIB)-mFc (an
   inhibitor of myostatin signaling) to promote hypertrophy and increase
   strength in our prior murine work; we therefore tested whether
   ActRIIB-mFc could improve weakness in NM mice through myofiber
   hypertrophy. We report a study of ActRIIB-mFc treatment in the Acta1
   H40Y mouse model of NM. Treatment of Acta1 H40Y mice produced
   significant increases in body mass, muscle mass, quadriceps myofiber
   size, and survival, but other measurements of strength (forelimb grip
   strength, ex vivo measurements of contractile function) did not improve.
   Our studies also identified that the complications of urethral
   obstruction are associated with mortality in male hemizygote Acta1 H40Y
   mice. The incidence of urethral obstruction and histologic evidence of
   chronic obstruction (inflammation) were significantly lower in Acta1
   H40Y mice that had been treated with ActRIIB-mFc. ActRIIB-mFc treatment
   produces a mild benefit to the disease phenotype in Acta1 H40Y mice.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE
   To evaluate the closure rate and completeness of closure for a
   silicone-polyacrylic acid gradual venous occlusion device placed around
   an intraabdominal vein to simulate gradual occlusion of an extrahepatic
   portosystemic shunt.
   ANIMALS
   3 purpose-bred cats and 2 purpose-bred dogs. PROCEDURES The device was
   surgically placed around an external (cats) or internal (dogs) iliac
   vein. Computed tomographic angiography was performed at the time of
   surgery and 2, 4, and 6 weeks after surgery. Ultrasonographic
   examinations of blood flow through the vein within the device were
   performed at the time of surgery and at weekly intervals thereafter.
   Dogs were euthanized 6 weeks after surgery, and the external iliac veins
   were harvested for histologic examination.
   RESULTS
   The prototype gradual venous occlusion device was successfully placed in
   all animals, and all animals recovered without complications following
   the placement procedure. The vessel was completely occluded in 2 cats by
   6 weeks after surgery, as determined on the basis of results of CT and
   ultrasonography; there was incomplete occlusion with a luminal diameter
   of 1.5 mm in the other cat by 6 weeks after surgery. The vessel was
   completely occluded in both dogs by 6 weeks after surgery. Histologic
   examination of the external iliac veins obtained from the dogs revealed
   minimal inflammation of the vessel wall and no thrombus formation.
   CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE
   The prototype device induced gradual attenuation of an intra-abdominal
   vessel over a 6-week period. This device may provide another option for
   gradual occlusion of extrahepatic portosystemic shunts.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, numerical methods of fatigue life prediction for
   elastomers subjected to multidirectional, variable amplitude loadings
   are presented. Because experiments and numerical methods use different
   stress measures in large deformation, transformation between nominal
   stress and the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress is performed before fatigue
   life calculation. In order to incorporate the Mullins effect, the
   material properties of elastomers are calculated after an initial
   transition period. An efficient interpolation scheme using load
   stress/strain curves under unidirectional loading is proposed based on
   the fatigue characteristic of elastomers. A rainflow counting method
   with multi-stress components is developed for variable amplitude
   loadings, and the critical plane method is applied to find the plane
   with the maximum damage parameter. Fatigue life predictions using the
   proposed numerical method are validated against experimental results. As
   a practical example, the fatigue life of a rubber engine mount is
   predicted using the proposed numerical method.}},

Abstract = {{Human behavioral response timing is highly variable from trial to trial.
   While it is generally understood that behavioral variability must be due
   to trial-by-trial variations in brain function, it is still largely
   unknown which physiological mechanisms govern the timing of neural
   activity as it travels through networks of neuronal populations, and how
   variations in the timing of neural activity relate to variations in the
   timing of behavior. In our study, we submitted recordings from the
   cortical surface to novel analytic techniques to chart the trajectory of
   neuronal population activity across the human cortex in single trials,
   and found joint modulation of the timing of this activity and of
   consequent behavior by neuronal oscillations in the alpha band (8-12
   Hz). Specifically, we established that the onset of population activity
   tends to occur during the trough of oscillatory activity, and that
   deviations from this preferred relationship are related to changes in
   the timing of population activity and the speed of the resulting
   behavioral response. These results indicate that neuronal activity
   incurs variable delays as it propagates across neuronal populations, and
   that the duration of each delay is a function of the instantaneous phase
   of oscillatory activity. We conclude that the results presented in this
   paper are supportive of a general model for variability in the effective
   speed of information transmission in the human brain and for variability
   in the timing of human behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper we investigate the light response to fast neutrons and
   estimate the pulse height resolution of a deuterated liquid organic
   scintillator, EJ-315, considering the detector's non-linear light
   response to gamma-rays. Initially, collision data and a neutron beam
   trigger are recorded in coincidence mode, and incident neutron energy is
   calculated with a time-of-flight technique. Fast neutrons are further
   discriminated from gamma-ray background based on the scintillation
   material decay patterns using a pulse shape discrimination algorithm. A
   light response matrix composed of multiple neutron energy and their
   corresponding light outputs is derived. The pulse height resolution
   property of the EJ-315 is characterized utilizing the derivatives of the
   pulse height distributions with corrections of the measurements setup
   uncertainties. Additionally, the EJ-315's pulse height resolution is
   also characterized by comparing the smoothed derivatives of
   quasi-monoenergetic neutron pulse height distributions, given by the
   Peierls-formula-based analytic model, to match the measurement data.
   Results show rather consistent 10-13\% pulse resolution for
   mono-energetic neutrons with kinetic energy above 2 MeV. The resolution
   decreases slightly with an increase in neutron energy indicating the
   improved resolution performance of EJ-315 in the higher energy events.

   conditions restrict the inclusion of higher-order terms depending upon
   the inclusion of lower-order parent terms. We develop classes of priors

   properties, and provide a Metropolis Hastings algorithm for searching

Abstract = {{Lime stabilization of clay soils is becoming, if not already, one of the
   most used construction techniques for road embankments and for subbase
   stabilization. In warm countries, lime stabilization is used without any
   problems; but in cold countries, some concerns are still present in
   relation to behavior of lime-stabilized soils at low temperatures,
   particularly in conditions of freezing and thawing. The research in this
   paper presents the results of an experimental campaign made on a typical
   Italian clay soil stabilized with lime. The research studies the
   evolution of mechanical performances of lime-stabilized soil under the
   effect of freeze and thaw cycles and after a series of several freezes
   and thaws. The results of the research clearly show that lime-stabilized
   soils can have proper mechanical performances after freeze and thaw
   cycles. In particular, the test campaign shows that lime-stabilized
   soils have decreased resistance after freeze and thaw cycles and that
   they almost fully recover their resistance if the temperature comes back
   constantly to 20 degrees C. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil

Title = {{How sensitive is the deltoid moment arm to humeral offset changes with
   reverse total shoulder arthroplasty?}},

Abstract = {{Background: Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty commonly treats
   cuff-deficient or osteoarthritic shoulders not amenable to rotator cuff
   repair. This study investigates deltoid moment arm sensitivity to
   variations in the joint center and humeral offset of 3 representative
   reverse total shoulder arthroplasty subjects. We hypothesized that a
   superior joint implant placement may exist, indicated by muscle moment
   arms, compared with the current actual surgical implant configuration.
   Methods: Moment arms for the anterior, lateral, and posterior aspects of
   the deltoid muscle were determined for 1521 perturbations of the humeral
   offset location away from the surgical placement in a subject-specific
   musculoskeletal model with motion defined by subject-specific in vivo
   abduction kinematics. The humeral offset was varied from its surgical
   position +/- 4 mm in the anterior/posterior direction, +/- 12 mm in the
   medial/lateral direction, and -10 to 14 mm in the superior/inferior
   direction.
   Results: The anterior deltoid moment arm varied in humeral offset and
   center of rotation up to 20 mm, primarily in the medial/lateral and
   superior/inferior directions. The lateral deltoid moment arm varied in
   humeral offset up to 20 mm, primarily in the medial/lateral and
   anterior/posterior directions. The posterior deltoid moment arm varied
   up to 15 mm, primarily in early abduction, and was most sensitive to
   humeral offset changes in the superior/inferior direction.
   Discussion: High variations in muscle moment arms were found for all 3
   deltoid components, presenting an opportunity to dramatically change the
   deltoid moment arms through surgical placement of the reverse shoulder
   components and by varying the overall offset of the humerus. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Extensive remodeling of the myocardium is seen in a variety of
   cardiovascular diseases, including systemic hypertension. Stem cell
   therapy has been proposed to improve the clinical outcomes of
   hypertension, and we hypothesized that changes in mechanical properties
   of the myocardium would accompany the progression of disease and the
   results of treatment conditions. Using spontaneously hypertensive rats
   (SHR) as a model of hypertension, we treated 13-week-old hypertensive
   rats with a single injection of adipose derived stem cells (ADSC)
   isolated from a normotensive control. We indented the isolated
   ventricles of control, untreated sham-injected SHR, and ADSC-treated SHR
   hearts with a custom cantilever-based system and fit the resulting data
   to a standard linear solid model. SHR animals had higher blood pressure
   (198.4 +/- 25.9 mmHg) and lower ejection fraction (69.9 +/- 4.2\%) than
   age-matched control animals (109.0 +/- 1.6 mmHg, 88.2 +/- 1.3\%), and
   increased viscoelastic properties accompanied these clinical changes
   (right ventricle effective stiffness, SHR: 21.97 +/- 5.10 kPa, Control:
   13.14 +/- 3.48 kPa). ADSC-treated animals saw improvement in clinical
   parameters compared to the untreated SHR group, which was also
   accompanied by a significant restoration of viscoelastic properties of
   the myocardium (ACSD-treated SHR: 9.77 +/- 6.96 kPa). (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Improving Short-Term Urban Water Demand Forecasts with Reforecast Analog
   Ensembles}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Urban water demand forecasting is key to municipal water supply
   management. Short-term urban water demands are influenced by weather
   conditions. Thus, short-term urban water demand forecasting could be
   improved by using accurate weather forecasting information. This study
   explores the potential of using an analog approach with a newly
   developed retrospective weather forecast (reforecast) of a numerical
   weather prediction (NWP) for improving short-term urban water demand
   forecasting. The analog method derives an analog ensemble forecast
   resampled from observed data (analogs) based on the reforecast of a NWP:
   the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS). The probabilistic and
   ensemble mean forecasts generated from analogs of weekly total rainfall
   (WeekRain), number of rainy days in one week (RainDays), number of
   consecutive rainy days in one week (CosRainDays), number of hot days in
   one week (HotDays), and daily mean temperature of the first seven lead
   days (T) from the reforecast were evaluated using in situ observations.
   The analog ensemble forecasts were used to drive seven water demand
   forecasting models based on autoregressive integrated moving average
   with exogenous inputs (ARIMAX) to make water demand forecasts in the
   Tampa Bay region of Florida. The GEFS-based analog forecast generally
   showed moderately high skill for WeekRain, RainDays, CosRainDays, and T
   but no skill for HotDays. The water demand forecasts driven by analog
   forecasts mostly showed higher skill than the original ARIMAX forecasts.
   Besides improving forecast accuracy, the analog-driven water demand
   forecasts accounted for the uncertainty of the weather forecasts,
   allowing for the assessment of demand forecast uncertainty. These
   results indicated that NWP-based analogs showed promising features for
   advancing the accuracy of short-term urban water demand forecasts. (C)

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE}},

Pages = {{100-112}},

Abstract = {{We compared the precision of simple random sampling (SimRS) and seven
   types of stratified random sampling (StrRS) schemes in estimating
   regional mean of water-limited yields for two crops (winter wheat and
   silage maize) that were simulated by fourteen crop models. We found that
   the precision gains of StrRS varied considerably across stratification
   methods and crop models. Precision gains for compact geographical
   stratification were positive, stable and consistent across crop models.
   Stratification with soil water holding capacity had very high precision
   gains for twelve models, but resulted in negative gains for two models.
   Increasing the sample size monotonously decreased the sampling errors
   for all the sampling schemes. We conclude that compact geographical
   stratification can modestly but consistently improve the precision in
   estimating regional mean yields. Using the most influential
   environmental variable for stratification can notably improve the
   sampling precision, especially when the sensitivity behavior of a crop
   model is known. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid growth in multimedia services and the enormous offers of
   video content in online social networks, users have difficulty in
   obtaining their interests. Therefore, various personalized
   recommendation systems have been proposed. However, they ignore that the
   accelerated proliferation of social media data has led to the big data
   era, which has greatly impeded the process of video recommendation. In
   addition, none of them has considered both the privacy of users'
   contexts (e.g., social status, ages, and hobbies) and video service
   vendors' repositories, which are extremely sensitive and of significant
   commercial value. To handle these problems, we propose a cloud-assisted
   differentially private video recommendation system based on distributed
   online learning. In our framework, service vendors are modeled as
   distributed cooperative learners, recommending videos according to
   user's context, while simultaneously adapting the video-selection
   strategy based on user-click feedback to maximize total user clicks
   (reward). Considering the sparsity and heterogeneity of big social media
   data, we also propose a novel geometric differentially private model,
   which can greatly reduce the performance loss. Our simulation shows the
   proposed algorithms outperform other existing methods and keep a
   delicate balance between the total reward and privacy preserving level.}},

Title = {{Role of graphene interlayers in mitigating degradation of Ni/Au ohmic
   contact morphology on p-type GaN}},
Journal = {{VACUUM}},

Volume = {{128}},
Pages = {{34-38}},

Abstract = {{We report an investigation of the effect of graphene interlayers in
   maintaining good surface morphology in low resistance Ni/Au Ohmic
   contacts to p-GaN (similar to 10(18) cm(-3)) annealed at 600 degrees C.
   Two different thin-film contact metallizations were compared, namely 20
   nm Ni/200 nm Au with and without a graphene layer diffusion barrier
   placed between the metals. Raman spectroscopy measured at several spots
   indicated single layer graphene, but subsequent transmission electron
   microscopy indicated that more generally the graphene was several nm
   thick. The unannealed contacts showed specific contact resistances of
   2.1 x 10(-5) Omega-cm(2) and 3.1 x 10(-4) Omega-cm(2) for Ni/Au and
   Ni/Graphene/Au, respectively. After rapid thermal annealing at 600
   degrees C for 60 s in a flowing N-2 ambient, X-Ray Photoelectron
   Spectroscopy and cross-sectional Transmission Electron Microscopy showed
   the usual Ni/Au interchange occurred in samples without graphene. By
   sharp contrast, insertion of graphene interlayers prevented the nickel
   and gold interchange up to 600 degrees C and dramatically improved the
   morphological stability of the metallization stack. The results may be
   beneficial to optoelectronic devices in which reflectivity is critical.

Title = {{Homogeneous hydride formation path in alpha-Zr: Molecular dynamics

Abstract = {{A path for homogeneous gamma hydride formation in hcp alpha-Zr, from
   solid solution to the zeta and then the gamma hydride, was demonstrated
   using molecular static calculations and molecular dynamic simulations
   with the charge-optimized many-body (COMB) potential. Hydrogen has
   limited solubility in alpha-Zr. Once the solubility limit is exceeded,
   the stability of solid solution gives way to that of coherent hydride
   phases such as the zeta hydride by planar precipitation of hydrogen. At
   finite temperatures, the zeta hydride goes through a partial hcp-fcc
   transformation via 1/3 < 1 (1) over bar 00 > slip on the basal plane,
   and transforms into a mixture of gamma hydride and alpha-Zr. In the zeta
   hydride, slip on the basal plane is favored thermodynamically with
   negligible barrier, and is therefore feasible at finite temperatures
   without mechanical loading. The transformation process involves slips of
   three equivalent shear partials, in contrast to that proposed in the
   literature where only a single shear partial was involved. The adoption
   of multiple slip partials minimizes the macroscopic shape change of
   embedded hydride clusters and the shear strain accumulation in the
   matrix, and thus reduces the overall barrier needed for homogeneous
   gamma hydride formation. This formation path requires finite
   temperatures for hydrogen diffusion without mechanical loading.
   Therefore, it should be effective at the cladding operating conditions.

Abstract = {{The Potential Optimization Software for Materials package (POSMat) is
   presented. POSMat is a powerful tool for the optimization of classical
   empirical interatomic potentials for use in atomic scale simulations, of
   which molecular dynamics is the most ubiquitous. Descriptions of the
   empirical formalisms and targetable properties available are given.
   POSMat includes multiple tools, including schemes and strategies to aid
   in the optimization process. Samples of the inputs and outputs are given
   as well as an example for fitting an MgO Buckingham potential, which
   illustrates how the targeted properties can influence the results of a
   developed potential. Approaches and tools for the expansion of POSMat to
   other interatomic descriptions and optimization algorithms are
   described.

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{26}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A laboratory-scale dc HTS prototype cable has been built and tested. The
   cable consists of two layers of HTS YBCO tapes with lengths of 1 m. In
   order to investigate the current distribution among the two HTS layers,
   the dc measurement was first performed to the cable wound with only the
   inner HTS layer in advance of the measurement of the completed cable
   with both layers. The contact resistances relevant to each HTS layer
   obtained from the measurement are considered as constant parameters to
   obtain the current of each HTS layer. It turns out that the nonuniform
   current distribution among each layer in the dc condition mainly results
   from the contact resistance with operating current less than the cable
   critical current and tends to become uniform when the operating current
   increases toward the cable critical current. A modified 2-D
   H-formulation, which takes into account the voltage drop due to the
   joint parts of the cable termination, has been applied to simulate the
   current distribution of the cable. A good consistency is obtained
   between the experimental and numerical modeling results.}},

Title = {{Dominant backscattering mechanisms at L-band during dynamic soil
   moisture conditions for sandy soils}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{178}},
Pages = {{104-112}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we investigate dominant backscattering mechanisms under
   different soil moisture (SM) and roughness conditions for bare sandy
   soils, and discuss potential impacts on active microwave algorithms for
   soil moisture estimation. This study used ground-based observations of
   backscattering coefficient (a) over three drydown periods. Under rough
   soil conditions, surface scattering was the dominant mechanism during
   both dry and wet periods, and the sigma(0) followed a power-law
   relationship with SM, with R-2 values > 0.86. However, under smooth soil
   conditions, the relationship was negative for SM < 0.07 m(3)/m(3). A
   simple volume scattering model was used to provide plausible explanation
   for such a behavior due to volume scattering. Sensitivities of sigma(0)
   to SM using both observed and modeled sigma(0) were analyzed. The
   observed sensitivity was higher for smooth soil than that for rough
   soil, when surface scattering was the dominant mechanism, while the
   sensitivity estimated by the AIEM model was largely unaffected by
   surface roughness. Observations at VV-pol were more sensitive to SM than
   at other polarizations by up to 1 dB/0.01m(3)/m(3) for rough soil, while
   the AIEM model estimated similar sensitivities at both VV and HH-pol,
   with the maximum difference between the modeled and observed
   sensitivities of 3 dB/0.01m(3)/m(3). This study demonstrates that volume
   scattering under dry, smooth conditions and a non-linear relationship
   between sigma(0) and SM under rough conditions in sandy soils may have
   significant impacts on estimate of SM using active algorithms. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO) were prepared via a sol-gel method, and a
   photo-assisted deposition method was used to prepare platinum on zinc
   oxide nanoparticles (Pt/ZnO). Several techniques were used to
   characterize these enhanced photocatalysts: XRD, TEM, UV-vis spectra, PL
   spectra, XPS, and BET surface area analysis. As-prepared samples'
   photocatalytic performances were studied via degradation of malachite
   green dye under various visible-light-only irradiation scenarios.
   Results demonstrated the following: platinum (Pt) was well dispersed on
   and in ZnO's surfaces and pores; as such, Pt/ZnO had less surface area
   than pure ZnO due to pore blockage; however, advantages gained from
   enhanced electron hole separation and decreased band gap width more than
   made up for this negative effect; moreover, Pt/ZnO prepared with 0.3
   wt\% Pt exhibited the lowest band gap and the highest photocatalytic
   activity of the various samples with a solids loading of 0.8 g/l;
   finally, such samples were recyclable, i.e., photo catalytic performance
   remained stable even after five uses. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and Techna

Abstract = {{We designed electrospun polycaprolactone mats consisting of nanofibers
   and microbeads for extended delivery of dexamethasone.
   Thin flexible dexamethasone loaded polycaprolactone mats were prepared
   by electrospinning. The solvents, polymer loading, voltage and
   tip-to-collector distance were varied to explore the effects on
   microstructure of the mats. The microstructure was determined by
   scanning electron microscope imaging; drug transport was measured and
   modeled, and X-ray diffraction was used to gauge the crystallinity. Drug
   transport and X-ray diffraction studies were also conducted with a spin
   cast film for comparison.
   Thin mats, about 10 mu m in thickness, were prepared by electrospinning.
   By controlling the voltage and tip-to-collector distance, we achieved a
   hybrid structure comprising of nanorods (nanofibers) and microbeads. The
   release profiles were fitted to the diffusion equation to obtain the
   diffusivities in the spheres and the rods. The diffusivity in the
   electrospun nanofibers was significantly lower compared to the casted
   films due to increased crystallinity, which was estimated from X-ray
   diffraction analysis. The electrospun hybrid mats sustained drug release
   for the desired duration of a month, in spite of the small thickness of
   about 10 mu m. By comparison, a ten-fold thicker cast film sustains
   release for about the same duration suggesting about 100-fold decrease
   in diffusivity in the electrospun mats due to increased crystallinity.
   Electrospun polycaprolactone mats are optimal for achieving long release
   durations due to increased crystallinity. Designing a hybrid structure
   by controlling the electrospinning parameters can be a useful approach
   to increase the release durations.}},

Title = {{Characteristics and DBP formation of dissolved organic matter from
   leachates of fresh and aged leaf litter}},
Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{152}},
Pages = {{335-344}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was leached from leaves of two trees
   commonly grown in subtropical regions, Pinus elliottii (commonly known
   as slash pine) and Schima superba (S. superba), and its degradation
   pattern and potential for forming disinfection byproducts (DBPs) were
   evaluated. The leaves were exposed in the field for up to one year
   before leaching. The DOM leached from slash pine litter contained on
   average 10.4 mg of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) per gram of dry
   weight; for S. superba the average was 37.2 mg-DOC/g-dry weight.
   Ultraviolet and visible light absorbance, fluorescence, and molecular
   weight analysis indicated that more aromatic/humic and higher molecular
   weight compounds are formed as leaf litter ages. A 4-component parallel
   factor analysis of the fluorescence data showed that the intensity of
   peaks related with protein-like components decreased gradually during
   biodegradation, while that of peaks attributed to humic-acid-like
   components increased continuously. Fresh slash pine leachates formed on
   average 40.0 mu g of trihalomethane (THM) per milligram of DOC, while S.
   superba leachates formed 45.6 mu g. THM formation showed peak values of
   55.7 mu g/mg DOC for slash pine and 74.9 mu g/mg DOC for S. superba
   after 8 months of aging. The formation of haloacetonitrile (HAN) and
   trichloronitromethane (TCNM) increased with increasing leaf age, while
   chloral hydrate (CH) formation did not show such a trend. Specific UV
   absorbance showed some positive correlation with DBPs, but
   humic-acid-like and protein-like absorbance peaks correlated with CH and
   TCNM yields in only some leaf samples. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{While the horizontal integrated circuit design process is extensively
   practiced, untrusted foundries can impose significant threats on the
   security of final products. A carefully inserted extra circuitry as a
   hardware trojan in a circuit layout can interfere with circuit
   functionality under very rare circumstances with inconsiderable
   footprints. In this paper, we introduce a novel layout-level
   vulnerability analysis flow to evaluate the susceptibility of a circuit
   layout's regions to hardware Trojan insertion. We also present several
   metrics based on a circuit layout to quantify the possibility of
   hardware Trojan insertion in a specific region of layout. Results of
   applying our flow to several benchmarks have revealed considerably high
   vulnerability of circuit layouts to hardware Trojan insertion.
   Furthermore, several Trojans are implemented and inserted in layout
   regions with different vulnerabilities to evaluate the effectiveness of
   our new metrics. Our novel layout-level vulnerability analysis flow
   makes it possible to quantitatively determine the vulnerability of
   different implementations of a circuit and analyze the susceptibility of
   each corner of circuit layout to different types of functional Trojans.}},

Abstract = {{Despite being densely packed with chromatin, nuclear bodies and a
   nucleoskeletal network, the nucleus is a remarkably dynamic organelle.
   Chromatin loops form and relax, RNA transcripts and transcription
   factors move diffusively, and nuclear bodies move. We show here that RNA
   splicing speckled domains (splicing speckles) fluctuate in constrained
   nuclear volumes and remodel their shapes. Small speckles move in a
   directed way toward larger speckles with which they fuse. This directed
   movement is reduced upon decreasing cellular ATP levels or inhibiting
   RNA polymerase II activity. The random movement of speckles is reduced
   upon decreasing cellular ATP levels, moderately reduced after inhibition
   of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling and modestly increased upon inhibiting
   RNA polymerase II activity. To define the paths through which speckles
   can translocate in the nucleus, we generated a pressure gradient to
   create flows in the nucleus. In response to the pressure gradient,
   speckles moved along curvilinear paths in the nucleus. Collectively, our
   results demonstrate a new type of ATP-dependent motion in the nucleus.
   We present a model where recycling splicing factors return as part of
   small sub-speckles from distal sites of RNA processing to larger
   splicing speckles by a directed ATP-driven mechanism through
   interchromatin spaces. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Title = {{Modelling the effects of heat stress on post-heading durations in wheat:
   A comparison of temperature response routines}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{222}},
Pages = {{45-58}},
Month = {{MAY 28}},
Abstract = {{Crop yield simulations are highly correlated to reproductive phase
   duration simulations, which are often affected by heat stress. In this
   study, we evaluated four widely used temperature response routines of
   wheat phenology (Bilinear, Sin, Beta, and Trapezoidal routines) to
   simulate heat stress effects on post heading durations with datasets
   from four years of environment-controlled phytotron experiments and
   multi-year field experiments across the main wheat production region in
   China. Significant reductions in post-heading duration were observed
   with increasing heat stress in phytotron experiments. A comparison of
   these temperature routines imbedded in the WheatGrow model showed that
   three of the routines could not predict post-heading durations under
   heat stress, while the Trapezoidal routine tended to overestimate high
   temperature impacts. Therefore, the three routines that could not
   simulate heat stress effects were extended by a senescence acceleration
   function. This function significantly improved the post-heading duration
   simulations under heat stress, regardless of the original temperature
   routine. However, the temperature threshold of initiating the senescence
   acceleration function varied depending on the original temperature
   response routine, between 27.3 and 30.1 degrees C. A new genotypic
   coefficient representing a cultivar-specific sensitivity to heat stress
   was introduced and ranged from 1.4 to 5.7 times of none heat-affected
   senescence per day. When evaluating the three temperature response
   routines linked with the added senescence acceleration function with
   independent phenology data (130 measurements), resulted in an average
   RMSE of 2.2 days for post-heading duration. The improved post-heading
   duration simulation is important for simulating current year-to-year
   yield variability due to frequent heat events, and it is even more
   critical for climate change impact assessments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Objective
   To compare performance of risk prediction models for forecasting
   postoperative sepsis and acute kidney injury.
   Design
   Retrospective single center cohort study of adult surgical patients
   admitted between 2000 and 2010.
   Patients
   50,318 adult patients undergoing major surgery.
   Measurements
   We evaluated the performance of logistic regression, generalized
   additive models, naive Bayes and support vector machines for forecasting
   postoperative sepsis and acute kidney injury. We assessed the impact of
   feature reduction techniques on predictive performance. Model
   performance was determined using the area under the receiver operating
   characteristic curve, accuracy, and positive predicted value. The
   results were reported based on a 70/30 cross validation procedure where
   the data were randomly split into 70\% used for training the model and
   the 30\% for validation.
   Main Results
   The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for
   different models ranged between 0.797 and 0.858 for acute kidney injury
   and between 0.757 and 0.909 for severe sepsis. Logistic regression,
   generalized additive model, and support vector machines had better
   performance compared to Naive Bayes model. Generalized additive models
   additionally accounted for non-linearity of continuous clinical
   variables as depicted in their risk patterns plots. Reducing the input
   feature space with LASSO had minimal effect on prediction performance,
   while feature extraction using principal component analysis improved
   performance of the models.
   Conclusions
   Generalized additive models and support vector machines had good
   performance as risk prediction model for postoperative sepsis and AKI.
   Feature extraction using principal component analysis improved the
   predictive performance of all models.}},

Abstract = {{A new method for quantisation error extraction in continuous-time
   delta-sigma modulators (CTDSMs) is proposed. The proposed method avoids
   the use of additional active components such as trans-conductors and
   opamps and uses only passive components. Instead, the virtual ground of
   the second stage integrator is used as a summing node and is utilised to
   extract the quantisation error. Thus, multi-stage CTDSM can be
   implemented in a power and area efficient way.}},

Title = {{Kernel least mean square with adaptive kernel size}},
Journal = {{NEUROCOMPUTING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{191}},
Pages = {{95-106}},
Month = {{MAY 26}},
Abstract = {{Kernel adaptive filters (KAF) are a class of powerful nonlinear filters
   developed in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). The Gaussian
   kernel is usually the default kernel in KAF algorithms, but selecting
   the proper kernel size (bandwidth) is still an open important issue
   especially for learning with small sample sizes. In previous research,
   the kernel size was set manually or estimated in advance by Silver man's
   rule based on the sample distribution. This study aims to develop an
   online technique for optimizing the kernel size of the kernel least mean
   square (KLMS) algorithm. A sequential optimization strategy is proposed,
   and a new algorithm is developed, in which the filter weights and the
   kernel size are both sequentially updated by stochastic gradient
   algorithms that minimize the mean square error (MSE). Theoretical
   results on convergence are also presented. The excellent performance of
   the new algorithm is confirmed by simulations on static function
   estimation, short term chaotic time series prediction and real world
   Internet traffic prediction. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hickory biochars were obtained through slow pyrolysis under 350 degrees
   C, 450 degrees C, and 600 degrees C. Multiple characterization
   techniques were used to characterize the biochars and showed pyrolysis
   temperature affected their O/C ratios, surface areas, cation-exchange
   capacities, zeta potential, surface acidic groups. As the result, the
   biochars showed different adsorption ability to Pb(II) and methylene
   blue in aqueous solutions, which was due to the important roles of the
   physicochemical properties of the biochars in controlling the sorption
   processes. This work provided a comprehensive evaluation of biochars,

Abstract = {{In situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and ex situ X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements on electrogenerated
   zirconium oxide films on zirconium (Zr/ZrO2) were used to quantify the
   oxide film thickness and resistivity profiles through the oxide. The EIS
   analysis presented here takes advantage of the high-frequency domain at
   which the constant-phase element (CPE) behavior of the oxide film
   reverts to a capacitive response and the Cole-Cole representations of
   the complex capacitance to extract the high-frequency capacitance of the
   oxide film without reference to the nature of the time-constant
   distribution within the oxide film. The film thickness of the ZrO2
   samples measured from the high-frequency capacitance of EIS were in good
   agreement with the thickness obtained from XPS. Moreover, the EIS
   analysis presented is based on the use of the integral solution of the
   power law model, which allows to obtain in one single EIS experiment,
   both the film thickness and the resistivity profile in the ZrO2 film.
   This work suggests a convenient graphical method to extract film
   properties and serves to validate a key assumption of the power-law
   model for interpretation of CPE parameters in terms of physical
   properties. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical simulations for a disk electrode show that the frequency at
   which time-constant dispersion appears depends on the characteristic
   dimension of the feature causing the dispersion. The characteristic
   dimension for a disk is the radius; for roughness, it is a function of
   rugosity and the period of the roughness; and for a capacitance
   distribution, it is the period of the distribution. Distributions of
   charge-transfer resistance do not cause time-constant dispersion because
   they influence neither the ohmic resistance nor the capacitance. As only
   the high-frequency impedance is affected by roughness and capacity
   distributions and charge-transfer resistance distributions do not cause
   frequency dispersion, surface heterogeneity in the form of roughness,
   capacitance, or charge-transfer resistance cannot provide an explanation
   for CPE behavior associated with surface distributions. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{During the Deep Water Horizon oil spill in 2010, approximately 4200 m(3)
   of Corexit 9500 were introduced to the Gulf of Mexico to disperse the
   4.9 million barrels of crude oil that were released. This was the first
   time that dispersants were applied below the ocean surface. For such
   subsurface applications, rates of adsorption could provide critical
   insight about a dispersant's ability to interact with a gushing oil
   plume. Most of the published literature, however, focuses on swirling
   flask and wave tank tests to quantify dispersant effectiveness and is
   more applicable to surface applications. To obtain a more comprehensive
   understanding of the interface and insight about adsorption rates, we
   measure dynamic interfacial tension and dilational rheology, which have
   not been previously reported for the Corexit 9500 system. Measurements
   show that increasing the aqueous salinity to approximately that of sea
   water drastically increases Corexit 9500s adsorption rates and lowers
   interfacial tensions. Specifically, the interfacial tension decreases
   from a pure interface value of 22.4 mN/m to approximately 2 mN/m at 10
   wt\% Corexit 9500 and 0.01 wt\% Corexit 9500 for the fresh and salt
   water systems, respectively. The time for achieving equilibrium is
   inversely proportional to the concentration. Dynamic and equilibrium
   interfacial tensions for both systems are well described by a simplified
   predictive model for several orders of magnitude in concentration.
   Finally, moderately high dilational moduli values which are frequency
   independent and primarily elastic in nature were measured. The time
   scales for adsorption reported here could be useful in designing the
   process for spraying the dispersant in deep-sea applications. The model
   parameters, although not physically correct due to the assumption of a
   single component system, could be useful in predicting the adsorption of
   the sprayed dispersant to the rising oil plume. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Evaluation of methods for calculating volume fraction in

Abstract = {{The present work addresses numerical methods required to compute
   particle volume fraction or number density. Local volume fraction of the
   lth particle, alpha(l), is the quantity of foremost importance in
   calculating the gas-mediated particle-particle interaction effect in
   multiphase flows. A general multiphase flow with a distribution of
   Lagrangian particles inside a fluid flow discretized on an Eulerian grid
   is considered. Particle volume fraction is needed both as a Lagrangian
   quantity associated with each particle and also as an Eulerian quantity
   associated with the grid cell for Eulerian-Lagrangian simulations. In
   Grid-Based (GB) methods the particle volume fraction is first obtained
   within each grid cell as an Eulerian quantity and then the local
   particle volume fraction associated with any Lagrangian particle can be
   obtained from interpolation. The second class of methods presented are
   Particle-Based (PB) methods, where particle volume fraction will first
   be obtained at each particle as a Lagrangian quantity, which then can be
   projected onto the Eulerian grid. Traditionally, the GB methods are used
   in multiphase flow, but subgrid resolution can be obtained through use
   of the PB methods. By evaluating the total error, and its
   discretization, bias and statistical error components, the performance
   of the different PB methods is compared against several common GB
   methods of calculating volume fraction. The standard von Neumann error
   analysis technique has been adapted for evaluation of rate of
   convergence of the different methods. The discussion and error analysis
   presented focus on the volume fraction calculation, but the methods can
   be extended to obtain field representations of other Lagrangian
   quantities, such as particle velocity and temperature. Published by

Title = {{Mercury removal and synergistic capture of SO2/NO by ammonium halides
   modified rice husk char}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{172}},
Pages = {{160-169}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Rice husk, a common agricultural waste and renewable biomass, was
   pyrolyzed and then impregnated with NH4Cl and NH4Br to develop an
   efficient sorbent for gaseous mercury removal from flue gas. The
   sorbents' performance was first investigated in a fixed-bed system with
   N-2 atmosphere at 150 degrees C and then in an entrained-flow system
   with real coal-fired flue gas at 150 degrees C. For comparison, a
   commercial coal-based activated carbon (CAC) treated with the same
   impregnation method was also studied. In the N-2 atmosphere, the mercury
   removal performance of rice husk char (RHC) was significantly enhanced
   after modification with ammonium halides, which are neither strong
   oxidants nor strong catalysts. The comparison of the RHC modified with
   HBr, NH4Br, CaBr2, (NH4) 2SO(4) and NH4OH with the same amount of
   bromine or ammonia confirmed the pivotal role of halogen in mercury
   removal. Although ammonia was proven to have no beneficial impact, the
   mercury removal capacity varied as the cation changed and increased as
   the pH of the halide impregnation solutions decreased. When tested in
   real coal-fired flue gas with a high concentration of SO2 (1177 ppmv)
   and NO (254 ppmv), the ammonium bromide impregnated RHC sorbent which
   had an excellent mercury removal performance in the fixed-bed still
   reached about 80\% efficiency for gaseous mercury removal. Furthermore,
   a synergistic effect on SO2/NO removal was observed for both ammonium
   halides modified RHC and CAC sorbents injected into the real coal-fired
   flue gas; the synergistic effect might be due to the oxidation effect of
   O-2 and H2O in the flue gas and the catalytic effect of the carbonaceous
   sorbent. Most micropore structure of the RHC was maintained after
   ammonium halides impregnation; however, the physisorption energy
   decreased in various degrees. Overall, in spite that the BET surface
   area and micropore volume of the RHC sorbent were smaller than the CAC,
   the RHC sorbent still reached a comparable level of multipollutants
   capture. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Number = {{19}},
Month = {{MAY 13}},
Abstract = {{Here we report a simple and scalable colloidal lithography technology
   for fabricating periodic arrays of gold nanodonuts for sensitive surface
   plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. This new bottom-up approach leverages
   a unique polymer wetting layer between a self-assembled,
   non-close-packed monolayer silica colloidal crystal and a silicon
   substrate to template ordered gold nanodonuts with tunable geometries
   over wafer-sized areas. The processes involved in this templating
   nanofabrication approach, including spin coating, oxygen plasma etching,
   and metal sputtering, are all compatible with standard microfabrication
   technologies. Specular reflection measurements reveal that the efficient
   electromagnetic coupling of the incident light with the tunable SPR
   modes of the templated gold nanodonut arrays enables good spectral
   tunability. Bulk refractive index sensing experiments show that a high
   SPR sensitivity of similar to 758 nm per refractive index unit, which
   outperforms many plasmonic nanostructures fabricated by both top-down
   and bottom-up approaches, can be achieved using the templated gold
   nanodonut arrays. Numerical finite-difference time-domain simulations
   have also been performed to complement the optical characterization and
   the theoretical results match well with the experimental measurements.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the adsorption and oxidation of n-butane on a
   stoichiometric RuO2(110) surface using temperature-programmed reaction
   spectroscopy (TPRS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. At
   low coverage, molecularly adsorbed n-butane achieves a binding energy of
   similar to 100 kJ/mol on RuO2(110), consistent with a strongly bound
   sigma-complex that forms through dative bonding interactions between the
   n-butane molecule and coordinatively unsaturated (cus) Ru atoms. We find
   that a fraction of the n-butane reacts with the RuO2 surface during TPRS
   to produce CO, CO2, and H2O that desorb above similar to 400 K and
   present evidence that adsorbed sigma-complexes serve as precursors to
   the initial C-H bond cleavage and ultimately the oxidation of n-butane
   on RuO2(110). From measurements of the product yields as a function of
   surface temperature we estimate that the initial reaction probability of
   n-butane on RuO2(110) decreases from 9\% to similar to 4\% with
   increasing surface temperature from 280 to 300 K and show that this
   temperature dependence is accurately described by a precursor-mediated
   mechanism. From kinetic analysis of the data we estimate a negative,
   apparent activation energy of -35.1 kJ/mol for n-butane dissociation on
   RuO2(110) and an apparent reaction prefactor of 6 x 10(-8). The low
   value of the apparent reaction prefactor suggests that motions of the
   adsorbed n-butane precursor are highly restricted on the RuO2(110)
   surface. DFT calculations confirm that n-butane forms strongly bound
   sigma-complexes on RuO2(110) and predict that C-H bond cleavage is
   strongly favored energetically. The n-butane binding energies and energy
   barrier for C-H bond cleavage predicted by DFT agree quantitatively with
   our experimental estimates.}},

Abstract = {{Single-file diffusion (SFD) of CO/CH4 and CO/CO2 mixtures as well as the
   corresponding pure gases in channels of polycrystalline L-Ala-L-Val
   dipeptide was investigated by pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR. The
   measured SFD mobilities of the mixtures, where each component was found
   to exhibit identical diffusion behavior, were compared with the SFD
   mobilities of the corresponding pure gases at the same or comparable
   total gas concentrations. Both studied mixtures were observed to diffuse
   faster than the slowest pure component forming the mixture. This
   observed behavior is in stark contrast to the trend often reported in
   the case of normal diffusion in microporous materials where the addition
   of a faster diffusing component to a slower diffusing component does not
   change significantly the diffusivity of the slower diffusing component.
   Molecular clustering in the studied single-file channels is proposed to
   explain the observed relationship between the mixture and one-component
   mobilities and to reconcile the experimental SFD data with the
   predictions of a random walk model reported earlier. For sufficiently
   large diffusion times, this random walk model predicts a transition from
   the SFD to the mechanism of center-of-mass diffusion, which is
   characterized by concerted movements of all molecules in each channel.
   This transition to center-of-mass diffusion was not observed
   experimentally for CO/CH4 and CO/CO2 mixtures.}},

Abstract = {{Kinetics of absorption of CO2 in an aqueous potassium carbonate (K2CO3)
   promoted by ethylaminoethanol (EAE) solution (hereafter termed as APCE
   solvent) was investigated in a glass stirred cell reactor by employing a
   fall in pressure technique. The reaction chemistry associated with the
   CO2-APCE solvent system was described by the zwitterion mechanism. The
   solubility and diffusivity of CO2 in the APCE solvent were
   experimentally determined at different experimental conditions.
   Furthermore, the effect of the initial EAE concentration (0.6-2
   kmol/m(3)) and reaction temperature (303-318 K) on the rate of
   absorption of CO2 was studied in detail. The experimental findings show
   that with the increase in the EAE concentration and reaction
   temperature, the. rate of CO2 absorption in the APCE solvent also
   increases considerably. Kinetic measurements further confirm that the
   absorption of CO2 in the APCE solvent belongs to the fast reaction
   regime with firstorder kinetics with respect to EAE and first-order
   kinetics with respect to CO2. Due to the addition of EAE as a promoter
   in an aqueous K2CO3, significant improvement in the rate of absorption
   of CO2 was realized. The rate constant (k(2)) for the CO2- APCE solvent
   system was observed to be higher as compared to monoethanolamine (MEA)
   promoted aqueous K2CO3. For instance, k(2) for the absorption of CO2 in
   the APCE solvent was observed to be equal to 45540 m(3)/kmol.s at 318 K.
   Furthermore, the activation energy for the CO2-APCE solvent system was
   estimated to be 81.7 kJ/mol. The lumped parameter, H-CO2 root D-CO2
   center dot k(2), where H-CO2 is solubility of CO2 and D-CO2 is
   diffusivity of CO2 in the APCE solvent, was calculated based on the
   kinetic measurements and observed to be equal to 1.2 x 10(-6)
   kmol(1/2)//m(1/2).s.kPa.}},

Abstract = {{Bicarbonate was investigated as a new counterion for six strong-base
   anion exchange resins considering the selective removal of six drinking
   water contaminants: nitrate, bromide, perchlorate, sulfate, chromate,
   and Suwannee River natural organic matter (SRNOM). The most selective
   bicarbonate-form resin for each contaminant was evaluated based on
   qualitative binary ion exchange plots and quantitative separation factor
   calculation. The influence of resin properties and ion characteristics
   was evaluated on resin selectivity for each contaminant. The type of
   functional group and polymer composition of the resin were shown to
   influence selectivity for inorganic contaminants, and the pore structure
   and polymer composition of resin were shown to influence selectivity for
   SRNOM. Bicarbonate-form resin with wide spacing of functional groups
   (i.e., triethylamine) and polystyrene composition was favorable for
   monovalent, hydrophobic contaminants, including nitrate, bromide, and
   perchlorate, whereas resin with close spacing of functional groups
   (i.e., trimethylamine) and polystyrene composition was favorable for
   relatively hydrophobic chromate and resin with same functional group and
   polyacrylic composition was favorable for relatively hydrophilic sulfate
   ion. For organic contaminant, bicarbonate-form resin with macroporous
   structure and polyacrylic composition was most selective for SRNOM. In
   addition, the resin selectivity sequence for each contaminant based on
   separation factor calculations was compared with adsorption isotherm
   parameters, and the similarities and differences are discussed. The
   separation factor method is based on ion exchange stoichiometry, whereas
   adsorption method is robust in terms of simplifying calculation. (C)

Abstract = {{The area and thickness of respiratory surfaces, and the constraints they
   impose on passive oxygen diffusion, have been linked to differences in
   oxygen consumption rates and/or aerobic activity levels in vertebrates.
   However, it remains unclear how respiratory surfaces and associated
   diffusion rates vary with body mass across vertebrates, particularly in
   relation to the body mass scaling of oxygen consumption rates. Here we
   address these issues by first quantifying the bodymass dependence of
   respiratory surface area and respiratory barrier thickness for a
   diversity of endotherms (birds and mammals) and ectotherms (fishes,
   amphibians, and reptiles). Based on these findings, we then use Fick's
   law to predict the body mass scaling of oxygen diffusion for each group.
   Finally, we compare the predicted body mass dependence of oxygen
   diffusion to that of oxygen consumption in endotherms and ectotherms. We
   find that the slopes and intercepts of the relationships describing the
   body mass dependence of passive oxygen diffusion in these two groups are
   statistically indistinguishable from those describing the body mass
   dependence of oxygen consumption. Thus, the area and thickness of
   respiratory surfaces combine to match oxygen diffusion capacity to
   oxygen consumption rates in both air-and water-breathing vertebrates. In
   particular, the substantially lower oxygen consumption rates of
   ectotherms of a given body mass relative to those of endotherms
   correspond to differences in oxygen diffusion capacity. These results
   provide insights into the long-standing effort to understand the
   structural attributes of organisms that underlie the body mass scaling
   of oxygen consumption.}},

Volume = {{121}},

Abstract = {{The amendment of concrete with waste products serves as an avenue to
   decrease the volume of wastes landfilled and to reduce the use of
   naturally mined materials, therefore, minimizing the footprint and
   impact that the construction industry has on the environment. This
   manuscript summarizes the current state of practice with regard to the
   use of waste products as supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) in
   portland cement concrete (PCC) and provides a summary of the
   comparatively sparse information on under-utilized waste materials such
   as: sugarcane bagasse ash, rice husk ash, waste wood biomass ash, and
   waste glass. The latter are all waste products that have the potential
   to be employed alongside traditional SCM, however much of the use to
   date has been done at the laboratory scale. This document will serve as
   a guide for the use of non-traditional waste SCM, to highlight areas
   likely requiring further refinement or research, and to indicate
   potential negative impacts from utilization of these products that might
   occur. The beneficial use of waste materials as SCM outside the United
   States has grown in recent years, mainly out of necessity; however,
   current research indicates that these materials typically provide a
   benefit when amending PCC and mortar. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier

   application from dense to dilute regimes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{MAY 7}},
Abstract = {{Multiphase flows are present in many important fields ranging from
   multiphase explosions to chemical processing. An important subset of
   multiphase flow applications involves dispersed materials, such as
   particles, droplets, and bubbles. This work presents an
   Eulerian-Eulerian model for multiphase flows containing dispersed
   particles surrounded by a continuous media such as air or water.
   Following a large body of multiphase literature, the driving force for
   particle acceleration is modeled as a direct function of both the
   continuous-phase pressure gradient and the gradient of intergranular
   stress existing within the particle phase. While the application of
   these two components of driving force is well accepted in much of the
   literature, other models exist in which the particle-phase pressure
   gradient itself drives particle motion. The multiphase model treats all
   phases as compressible and is derived to ensure adherence to the 2nd Law
   of Thermodynamics. The governing equations are presented and discussed,
   and a characteristic analysis shows the model to be hyperbolic, with a
   degeneracy in the case that the intergranular stress, which is modeled
   as a configuration pressure, is zero. Finally, results from a two sample
   problems involving shock-induced particle dispersion are presented. The
   results agree well with experimental measurements, providing initial
   confidence in the proposed model. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{We used temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and reflection
   absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) to characterize the adsorption
   of NO on crystalline iron oxide films grown on Ag(111), including a
   Fe3O4(111) layer, an FeO(111) monolayer, and an intermediate FeOx
   multilayer structure. TPD shows that the NO binding energies vary
   significantly among the Fe cation sites present on these FeOx surfaces,
   and provides evidence that NO binds more strongly on Fe2+ sites than
   Fe3+ sites. The NO TPD spectra obtained from the Fe3O4(111) layer
   exhibit a dominant peak at 380 K, attributed to NO bound on Fe2+ sites,
   as well as a broad feature centered at similar to 250 K that is
   consistent with NO bound on Fe3+ sites of Fe3O4(111) as well as NO
   adsorbed on a minority FeO structure. The NO TPD spectra obtained from
   the monolayer FeO(111) film exhibits a prominent peak at 269 K. After
   growing FeOx multilayer islands within the FeO(111) monolayer, we
   observe a new NO TPD feature at similar to 200 K as well as diminution
   of the sharp TPD peak at 269 K. We speculate that these changes occur
   because the multilayer FeOx islands expose Fe3+ sites that bind NO more
   weakly than the Fe2+ sites of the FeO monolayer. RAIR spectra obtained
   from the NO-covered FeOx surfaces exhibit an N-O stretch band that
   blueshifts over a range from about 1800 to 1840 cm(-1) with increasing
   NO coverage. The measured N-O stretching frequency is only slightly
   red-shifted from the gas-phase value, and lies in a range that is
   consistent with atop, linearly bound NO on the Fe surface sites. In
   contrast to the NO binding energy, we find that the N-O stretch band is
   relatively insensitive to the NO binding site on the FeOx surfaces. This
   behavior suggests that pi-backbonding occurs to similar extents among
   the adsorbed NO species, irrespective of the oxidation state and local
   structural environment of the Fe surface site.}},

   Behaving Rats}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{MAY 5}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the relationship between brain function and behavior
   remains a major challenge in neuroscience. Photoacoustic tomography
   (PAT) is an emerging technique that allows for noninvasive in vivo brain
   imaging at micrometer-millisecond spatiotemporal resolution. In this
   article, a novel, miniaturized 3D wearable PAT (3D-wPAT) technique is
   described for brain imaging in behaving rats. 3D-wPAT has three layers
   of fully functional acoustic transducer arrays. Phantom imaging
   experiments revealed that the in-plane X-Y spatial resolutions were
   similar to 200 mu m for each acoustic detection layer. The functional
   imaging capacity of 3D-wPAT was demonstrated by mapping the cerebral
   oxygen saturation via multi-wavelength irradiation in behaving hyperoxic
   rats. In addition, we demonstrated that 3D-wPAT could be used for
   monitoring sensory stimulus-evoked responses in behaving rats by
   measuring hemodynamic responses in the primary visual cortex during
   visual stimulation. Together, these results show the potential of
   3D-wPAT for brain study in behaving rodents.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we propose a new approach for model reduction of
   parameterized partial differential equations (PDEs) by a locally
   weighted proper orthogonal decomposition (LWPOD) method. The presented
   approach is particularly suited for large-scale nonlinear systems
   characterized by parameter variations. Instead of using a global basis
   to construct a global reduced model, LWPOD approximates the original
   system by multiple local reduced bases. Each local reduced basis is
   generated by the singular value decomposition of a weighted snapshot
   matrix. Compared with global model reduction methods, such as the
   classical proper orthogonal decomposition, LWPOD can yield more accurate
   solutions with a fixed subspace dimension. As another contribution, we
   combine LWPOD with the chord iteration to solve elliptic PDEs in a
   computationally efficient fashion. The potential of the method for
   achieving large speedups while maintaining good accuracy is demonstrated
   for both elliptic and parabolic PDEs in a few numerical examples.

Abstract = {{In the aftermath of disasters, evacuating aging victims and maintaining
   an optimal flow of critical resources in order to serve their needs
   becomes problematic, especially for Gulf Coast states in the USA such as
   Florida, where more than 6.9 million (36.9\%) of the population are over
   age 50. Scanning the literature, there is no substantial prior work that
   has synthesized the requirements for a multi-modal emergency needs
   assessment that could facilitate the safe and accessible evacuation of
   aging people, and optimize the flow of resources into the affected
   region to satisfy the needs of those who remain. This paper presents a
   review of the aging population-focused emergency literature utilizing a
   knowledge base development methodology supported with a geographic
   information system-based case study application set in Florida.
   Importance is given to both ensuring the resiliency of the
   transportation infrastructure and meeting the needs of aging
   populations. As a result of this metadata-based analysis, critical
   research needs and challenges are presented with planning
   recommendations and future research directions. Results clearly indicate
   that transportation agencies should focus on clear and fast
   dissemination of disaster-related information to the aging populations.
   The use of paratransit services for evacuating aging people, especially
   those living independently and/or in rural areas, is also found to be of
   paramount importance.}},

Abstract = {{Phosphorus (P) driven eutrophication remains a problem in waterways
   worldwide. High P levels can significantly alter ecosystems, changing
   species composition and diversity. Most current P treatment technologies
   cannot adequately remove recalcitrant forms of P from the water column.
   As a result, this study evaluated the UV/H2O2 advanced oxidation process
   (AOP) for the photodegradation of recalcitrant-P in natural waters to
   biologically available phosphate, which is analogous to soluble reactive
   P (SRP). In turn, SRP can be removed using available P treatment
   technologies. The UV/H2O2 AOP was tested in synthetic waters and natural
   water from the Florida Everglades. Results showed that the
   photodegradation of recalcitrant P to SRP is possible using UV fluences
   of at least 5.1 J/cm(2) and H2O2 doses of at least 50 mg H2O2/L. The
   UV/H2O2 AOP was able to consistently convert recalcitrant-P to SRP in
   synthetic waters. However, the complex chemistry of Everglades water
   made consistent conversion of recalcitrant-P to SRP hard to achieve. An
   increase in the efficiency of UV lights is needed to make the UV/H2O2
   AOP economically feasible for conversion of recalcitrant-P to SRP in
   natural waters. (C) 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

Abstract = {{The production and sale of counterfeit and substandard pharmaceutical
   products, such as essential medicines, is an important global public
   health problem. We describe a chemometric passport-based approach to
   improve the security of the pharmaceutical supply chain. Our method is
   based on applying nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spectroscopy to
   authenticate the contents of medicine packets. NQR is a non-invasive,
   non-destructive, and quantitative radio frequency (RF) spectroscopic
   technique. It is sensitive to subtle features of the solid-state
   chemical environment and thus generates unique chemical fingerprints
   that are intrinsically difficult to replicate. We describe several
   advanced NQR techniques, including two-dimensional measurements,
   polarization enhancement, and spin density imaging, that further improve
   the security of our authentication approach. We also present
   experimental results that confirm the specificity and sensitivity of NQR
   and its ability to detect counterfeit medicines.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in biomedical sensors and mobile communication technologies
   have fostered the rapid growth of mobile health (mHealth) applications
   in the past years. Users generate a high volume of biomedical data
   during health monitoring, which can be used by the mHealth server for
   training predictive models for disease diagnosis and treatment. However,
   the biomedical sensing data raise serious privacy concerns because they
   reveal sensitive information such as health status and lifestyles of the
   sensed subjects. This paper proposes and experimentally studies a scheme
   that keeps the training samples private while enabling accurate
   construction of predictive models. We specifically consider logistic
   regression models which are widely used for predicting dichotomous
   outcomes in healthcare, and decompose the logistic regression problem
   into small subproblems over two types of distributed sensing data, i.e.,
   horizontally partitioned data and vertically partitioned data. The
   subproblems are solved using individual private data, and thus mHealth
   users can keep their private data locally and only upload (encrypted)
   intermediate results to the mHealth server for model training.
   Experimental results based on real datasets show that our scheme is
   highly efficient and scalable to a large number of mHealth users.}},

Abstract = {{Onsets of electron density enhancements in the upper nighttime
   mesosphere produced by electric field heating of electrons are examined
   using a photochemical model that accounts for 29 dynamic species via a
   set of 156 reactions. Physical mechanisms are identified which result in
   electron density enhancements that continuously increase for up to
   several seconds after electric field heating, establishing the
   conditions under which early VLF scattering is either fast (<20ms) or
   slower(>20ms, including slow, 500ms). During heating, O- ions are
   produced by heterolysis, e(-) + O-2 e(-) + O- + O+, and dissociative
   attachment, e(-)+ O-2 O- + O. Following heating, a significant
   proportion of O- ions associatively detach with molecular oxygen, O- +
   O-2 O-3 + e(-), and atomic oxygen, O- + O O-2 + e(-). If enough O- ions
   are produced during heating such that O- detachment exceeds electron
   loss (predominantly attachment, e(-) + O-3
   <mml:msubsup>O2-</mml:msubsup> + O, and/or electron-ion recombination),
   electron densities will continue to increase after heating has ended.
   Consequently, the total risetime of electron density enhancements
   produced by electric field heating is controlled by the duration of the
   electric field heating and (in some cases) the effects of O- detachment
   following heating.}},

   convolved and the measured profiles are subject to the same VAE, the
   calculated profiles match the implicit ``real{''} ones when the
   optimization converges. Three DRFs (Gaussian, Lorentzian, and parabolic
   function) were used for three ionization chambers (CC04, CC13, and
   SNC125c) in this study. Geometry dependent/independent DRFs were
   obtained by minimizing the difference between the ionization
   chamber-measured profiles and the diode-measured profiles convolved with
   the DRFs. These DRFs were used to obtain eighteen beam models for a
   commercial TPS. Accuracy of the beam models were evaluated by assessing
   the 20\%-80\% penumbra width difference (PWD) between the computed and
   diode-measured beam profiles.
   Results: The convolution-based approach was found to be effective for
   all three ionization chambers with significant improvement for all beam
   models. Up to 17\% geometry dependence of the three DRFs was observed
   for the studied ionization chambers. With geometry dependent DRFs, the
   PWD was within 0.80 mm for the parabolic function and CC04 combination
   and within 0.50 mm for other combinations; with geometry independent
   DRFs, the PWD was within 1.00 mm for all cases. When using the Gaussian
   function as the DRF, accounting for geometry dependence led to marginal
   improvement (PWD < 0.20 mm) for CC04; the improvement ranged from 0.38
   to 0.65 mm for CC13; for SNC125c, the improvement was slightly above
   0.50 mm.
   Conclusions: Although all three DRFs were found adequate to represent
   the response of the studied ionization chambers, the Gaussian function
   was favored due to its superior overall performance. The geometry
   dependence of the DRFs can be significant for clinical applications
   involving small fields such as stereotactic radiotherapy. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Fatigue crack growth coupon tests play an important role in designing
   safe and lightweight aircraft structures. How many fatigue crack growth
   coupon tests are enough is an important question to be answered. With
   few coupon tests, there will be a substantial uncertainty in design
   weight, with a significant chance of getting a heavier design, and a
   considerable chance of overestimating fatigue crack growth design life.
   A simulation study is presented to determine the optimal number of
   fatigue crack growth coupon tests by trading off testing cost against
   structural weight cost. It also gives a designer an idea on how
   increasing the number of tests reduces the risk of overestimating design
   life. The tradeoff is demonstrated for the damage-tolerant design of the
   lower spar caps of a business jet's wing. With eight coupon tests, there
   is a 26\% chance of incurring at least 2.4\% weight penalty and 18\%
   chance of overestimating the fatigue crack growth life by more than
   10\%. For 64 tests, the chances reduce to 3 and 0.5\%, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Convection enhanced delivery (CED) is a promising novel technology to
   treat neural diseases, as it can transport macromolecular therapeutic
   agents greater distances through tissue by direct infusion. To minimize
   off-target delivery, our group has developed 3D computational transport
   models to predict infusion flow fields and tracer distributions based on
   magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging data sets. To improve
   the accuracy of our voxelized models, generalized anisotropy (GA), a
   scalar measure of a higher order diffusion tensor obtained from high
   angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) was used to improve tissue
   segmentation within complex tissue regions of the hippocampus by
   capturing small feature fissures. Simulations were conducted to reveal
   the effect of these fissures and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) boundaries on
   CED tracer diversion and mistargeting. Sensitivity analysis was also
   conducted to determine the effect of dorsal and ventral hippocampal
   infusion sites and tissue transport properties on drug delivery.
   Predicted CED tissue concentrations from this model are then compared
   with experimentally measured MR concentration profiles. This allowed for
   more quantitative comparison between model predictions and MR
   measurement. Simulations were able to capture infusate diversion into
   fissures and other CSF spaces which is a major source of CED
   mistargeting. Such knowledge is important for proper surgical planning.}},

Abstract = {{The mineralized extracellular matrix (ECM) of bone is essential in
   vertebrates to provide structure, locomotion, and protect vital organs,
   while also acting as a calcium and phosphate reservoir to maintain
   homeostasis. Bone's structure comprises mainly structural collagen
   fibrils, hydroxyapatite nanocrystals and water, and it is the
   organization of the densely-packed collagen matrix that directs the
   organization of the mineral crystallites. Biogenic mineralization occurs
   when osteoblasts release ``mineral bearing globules{''} which fuse into
   the preformed collagen matrix, and upon crystallization of this
   amorphous precursor, the fibrils become embedded with {[}001] oriented
   nanocrystals of hydroxyapatite. Our prior work has shown that this
   nanostructured organization of bone can be reproduced in vitro using the
   polymer-induced liquid-precursor (PILP) process. In this report, our
   focus is on using biomimetic processing to recreate both the nano- and
   micro-structure of lamellar bone. We first applied molecular crowding
   techniques to acidic, type-I collagen solutions to form dense, liquid
   crystalline collagen (LCC) scaffolds with cholesteric order. We
   subsequently mineralized these LCCs via the PILP process to achieve a
   high degree of intrafibrillar mineral, with compositions and
   organization similar to that of native bone and with a ``lamellar{''}
   microstructure generated by the twisting LCC template. In depth
   characterization of the nano- and micro-structure was performed,
   including optical and electron microscopy, X-ray and electron
   diffraction, and thermogravimetric analyses. The results of this work
   lead us closer to our goal of developing hierarchically structured,
   collagen-hydroxyapatite composites which can serve as fully synthetic,
   bioresorbable, load-bearing bone substitutes that are remodeled by the
   native BRU. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Inspired by standard electrophysiological models of microtubules, a
   discrete nonlinear equation for ionic wave propagation that incorporates
   a negative nonlinear resistance is presented. The conditions for wave
   propagation in forbidden band gap are analyzed without and with
   dissipation. The nonlinear response manifold method is used to determine
   the supratransmission threshold of the case of study without
   dissipation. This threshold is found to be similar to the value obtained
   by analytical methods. With the dissipation, the monitoring of the
   accumulated energy is used to estimate the infratransmission threshold.
   It appears that the value of the supratransmission threshold can be
   lower than the value of the infratransmission threshold. The system is
   found to amplify significantly the amplitude of the input signal, thus
   confirming known experimental results. Nevertheless, a proper choice of
   the parameter of the nonlinear resistance is required for further
   validation of our results. A possible biological implication of the
   obtained results is presented. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Journal = {{DISCRETE OPTIMIZATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{20}},
Pages = {{105-134}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The competitive set covering problem is a two-player Stackelberg (leader
   follower) game involving a set of items and clauses. The leader acts
   first to select a set of items, and with knowledge of the leader's
   action, the follower then selects another subset of items. There exists
   a set of clauses, where each clause is a prioritized set of items. A
   clause is satisfied by the selected item having the highest priority,
   resulting in a reward for the player that introduced the
   highest-priority selected item. We examine a mixed-integer bilevel
   programming (MIBLP) formulation for a competitive set covering problem,
   assuming that both players seek to maximize their profit. This class of
   problems arises in several fields, including non-cooperative product
   introduction and facility location games. We develop an MIBLP model for
   this problem in which binary decision variables appear in both stages of
   the model. Our contribution regards a cutting-plane algorithm, based on
   inequalities that support the convex hull of feasible solutions and
   induce faces of non-zero dimension in many cases. Furthermore, we
   investigate alternative verification problems to equip the algorithm
   with cutting planes that induce higher-dimensional faces, and
   demonstrate that the algorithm significantly improves upon existing
   general solution method for MIBLPs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Insights into Entropy as a Measure of Multivariate Variability}},

Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Entropy has been widely employed as a measure of variability for
   problems, such as machine learning and signal processing. In this paper,
   we provide some new insights into the behaviors of entropy as a measure
   of multivariate variability. The relationships between multivariate
   entropy (joint or total marginal) and traditional measures of
   multivariate variability, such as total dispersion and generalized
   variance, are investigated. It is shown that for the jointly Gaussian
   case, the joint entropy (or entropy power) is equivalent to the
   generalized variance, while total marginal entropy is equivalent to the
   geometric mean of the marginal variances and total marginal entropy
   power is equivalent to the total dispersion. The smoothed multivariate
   entropy (joint or total marginal) and the kernel density estimation
   (KDE)-based entropy estimator (with finite samples) are also studied,
   which, under certain conditions, will be approximately equivalent to the
   total dispersion (or a total dispersion estimator), regardless of the
   data distribution.}},

Pages = {{826-848}},

Abstract = {{We derive a synaptic weight update rule for learning temporally precise
   spike train-to-spike train transformations in multilayer feedforward
   networks of spiking neurons. The framework, aimed at seamlessly
   generalizing error backpropagation to the deterministic spiking neuron
   setting, is based strictly on spike timing and avoids invoking concepts
   pertaining to spike rates or probabilistic models of spiking. The
   derivation is founded on two innovations. First, an error functional is
   proposed that compares the spike train emitted by the output neuron of
   the network to the desired spike train by way of their putative impact
   on a virtual postsynaptic neuron. This formulation sidesteps the need
   for spike alignment and leads to closed-form solutions for all
   quantities of interest. Second, virtual assignment of weights to spikes
   rather than synapses enables a perturbation analysis of individual spike
   times and synaptic weights of the output, as well as all intermediate
   neurons in the network, which yields the gradients of the error
   functional with respect to the said entities. Learning proceeds via a
   gradient descent mechanism that leverages these quantities. Simulation
   experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed learning framework.
   The experiments also highlight asymmetries between synapses on
   excitatory and inhibitory neurons.}},

Title = {{Engineering galectin-glycan interactions for immunotherapy and

Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1074-1083}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Galectins, a 15-member family of soluble carbohydrate-binding proteins,
   are receiving increasing interest as therapeutic targets for
   immunotherapy and immunomodulation due to their role as extracellular
   signals that regulate innate and adaptive immune cell phenotype and
   function. However, different galectins can have redundant, synergistic,
   or antagonistic signaling activity in normal immunological responses,
   such as resolution of inflammation and induction of antigen-specific
   tolerance. In addition, certain galectins can be hijacked to promote
   progression of immunopathologies, such as tumor immune privilege,
   metastasis, and viral infection, while others can inhibit these
   processes. Thus, eliciting a desired immunological outcome will likely
   necessitate therapeutics that can precisely enhance or inhibit
   particular galectin-glycan interactions. Multivalency is an important
   determinant of the affinity and specificity of natural galectin-glycan
   interactions, and is emerging as a key design element for therapeutics
   that can effectively manipulate galectin bioactivity. This minireview
   surveys current molecular and biomaterial engineering approaches to
   create therapeutics that can stabilize galectin multivalency or
   recapitulate natural glycan multivalency (i.e. the glycocluster effect).
   In particular, we highlight examples of using natural and engineered
   multivalent galectins for immunosuppression and immune tolerance, with a
   particular emphasis on treating autoimmune diseases or avoiding
   transplant rejection. In addition, we present examples of multivalent
   inhibitors of galectin-glycan interactions to maintain or restore T-cell
   function, with a particular emphasis on promoting antitumor immunity.
   Finally, we discuss emerging opportunities to further engineer
   galectin-glycan interactions for immunotherapy and immunomodulation.}},

Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a genetic disease, due to progressive
   accumulation of mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Large
   scale genomic sequencing projects revealed >100 mutations in any
   individual CRC. Many of these mutations are likely passenger mutations,
   and fewer are driver mutations. Of these, activating mutations in RAS
   proteins are essential for cancer initiation, progression, and/or
   resistance to therapy. There has been significant interest in developing
   drugs targeting mutated cancer gene products or downstream signaling
   pathways. Due to the number of mutations involved and inherent
   redundancy in intracellular signaling, drugs targeting one mutation or
   pathway have been either ineffective or led to rapid resistance. We have
   devised a strategy whereby multiple cancer pathways may be
   simultaneously targeted for drug discovery. For proof-of-concept, we
   targeted the oncogenic KRAS and HIF pathways, since oncogenic KRAS has
   been shown to be required for cancer initiation and progression, and
   HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha are induced by the majority of mutated
   oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in CRC. We have generated isogenic
   cell lines defective in either oncogenic KRAS or both HIF-1 alpha and
   HIF-2 alpha and subjected them to multiplex genomic, siRNA, and high
   throughput small molecule screening. We have identified potential drug
   targets and compounds for preclinical and clinical development.
   Screening of our marine natural product library led to the rediscovery
   of the microtubule agent dolastatin 10 and the class I histone
   deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor largazole to inhibit oncogenic KRAS and HIF
   pathways. Largazole was further validated as an antiangiogenic agent in
   a HIP-dependent manner in human cells and in vivo in zebrafish using a
   genetic model with activated HIF. Our general strategy, coupling
   functional genomics with drug susceptibility or chemical-genetic
   interaction screens, enables the identification of potential drug
   targets and candidates with requisite selectivity. Molecules prioritized
   in this manner can easily be validated in suitable zebrafish models due
   to the genetic tractability of the system. Our multidimensional platform
   with cellular and organismal components can be extended to larger scale
   multiplex screens that include other mutations and pathways.}},

Abstract = {{Nearly 12 million wounds are treated in emergency departments throughout
   the United States every year. The limitations of current treatments for
   complex, full-thickness wounds are the driving force for the development
   of new wound treatment devices that result in faster healing of both
   dermal and epidermal tissue. Here, a bilayered, biodegradable hydrogel
   dressing that uses microarchitecture to guide two key steps in the
   proliferative phase of wound healing, re-epithelialization, and
   revascularization, was evaluated in vitro in a cell migration assay and
   in vivo in a bipedicle ischemic rat wound model. Results indicate that
   the Sharklet (TM) - micropatterned apical layer of the dressing
   increased artificial wound coverage by up to 64\%, P = 0.024 in vitro.
   In vivo evaluation demonstrated that the bilayered dressing construction
   enhanced overall healing outcomes significantly compared to untreated
   wounds and that these outcomes were not significantly different from a
   leading clinically available wound dressing. Collectively, these results
   demonstrate high potential for this new dressing to effectively
   accelerate wound healing.}},

Abstract = {{Online social networks have become an effective and important social
   platform for communication, opinions exchange, and information sharing.
   However, they also make it possible for rapid and wide misinformation
   diffusion, which may lead to pernicious influences on individuals or
   society. Hence, it is extremely important and necessary to detect the
   misinformation propagation by placing monitors.
   In this article, we first define a general misinformation-detection
   problem for the case where the knowledge about misinformation sources is
   lacking, and show its equivalence to the influence-maximization problem
   in the reverse graph. Furthermore, considering node vulnerability, we
   aim to detect the misinformation reaching to a specific user. Therefore,
   we study a tau-Monitor Placement problem for cases where partial
   knowledge of misinformation sources is available and prove its \#P
   complexity. We formulate a corresponding integer program, tackle
   exponential constraints, and propose a Minimum Monitor Set Construction
   (MMSC) algorithm, in which the cut-set(2) has been exploited in the
   estimation of reachability of node pairs. Moreover, we generalize the
   problem from a single target to multiple central nodes and propose
   another algorithm based on a Monte Carlo sampling technique. Extensive
   experiments on real-world networks show the effectiveness of proposed
   algorithms with respect to minimizing the number of monitors.}},

Abstract = {{As renewable energy penetration rates continue to increase in power
   systems worldwide, new challenges arise for system operators in both
   regulated and deregulated electricity markets to solve the
   security-constrained coal-fired unit commitment problem with
   intermittent generation (due to renewables) and uncertain load, in order
   to ensure system reliability and maintain cost effectiveness. In this
   paper, we study a security-constrained coal-fired stochastic unit
   commitment model, which we use to enhance the reliability unit
   commitment process for day-ahead power system operations. In our
   approach, we first develop a deterministic equivalent formulation for
   the problem, which leads to a large-scale mixed-integer linear program.
   Then, we verify that the turn on/off inequalities provide a convex hull
   representation of the minimum-up/down time polytope under the stochastic
   setting. Next, we develop several families of strong valid inequalities
   mainly through lifting schemes. In particular, by exploring sequence
   independent lifting and subadditive approximation lifting properties for
   the lifting schemes, we obtain strong valid inequalities for the ramping
   and general load balance polytopes. Finally, branch-and-cut algorithms
   are developed to employ these valid inequalities as cutting planes to
   solve the problem. Our computational results verify the effectiveness of
   the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Deep learning systems aim at using hierarchical models to learning
   high-level features from low-level features. The progress in deep
   learning is great in recent years. The robustness of the learning
   systems with deep architectures is however rarely studied and needs
   further investigation. In particular, the mean square error (MSE), a
   commonly used optimization cost function in deep learning, is rather
   sensitive to outliers (or impulsive noises). Robust methods are needed
   to improve the learning performance and immunize the harmful influences
   caused by outliers which are pervasive in real-world data. In this
   paper, we propose an efficient and robust deep learning model based on
   stacked auto-encoders and Correntropy-induced loss function (CLF),
   called CLF-based stacked auto-encoders (CSAE). CLF as a nonlinear
   measure of similarity is robust to outliers and can approximate
   different norms (from to ) of data. Essentially, CLF is an MSE in
   reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Different from conventional stacked
   auto-encoders, which use, in general, the MSE as the reconstruction loss
   and KL divergence as the sparsity penalty term, the reconstruction loss
   and sparsity penalty term in CSAE are both built with CLF. The
   fine-tuning procedure in CSAE is also based on CLF, which can further
   enhance the learning performance. The excellent and robust performance
   of the proposed model is confirmed by simulation experiments on MNIST
   benchmark dataset.}},

Abstract = {{The wave bottom boundary layer is a major conduit delivering fine
   terrestrial sediments to continental margins. Hence, studying fine
   sediment resuspensions in the wave boundary layer is crucial to the
   understanding of various components of the earth system, such as carbon
   cycles. By assuming the settling velocity to be a constant in each
   simulation, previous turbulence-resolving numerical simulations reveal
   the existence of three transport modes in the wave boundary layer
   associated with sediment avail abilities. As the sediment availability
   and hence the sediment-induced stable stratification increases, a
   sequence of transport modes, namely, (I) well-mixed transport, (II)
   formulation of lutocline resembling a two-layer system, and (III)
   completely laminarized transport are observed. In general, the settling
   velocity is a flow variable due to hindered settling and particle
   inertia effects. Present numerical simulations including the particle
   inertia suggest that for a typical wave condition in continental
   shelves, the effect of particle inertia is negligible. Through
   additional numerical experiments, we also confirm that the particle
   inertia tends (up to the Stokes number St = 0.2) to attenuate flow
   turbulence. On the other hand, for flocs with lower gelling
   concentrations, the hindered settling can play a key role in sustaining
   a large amount of suspended sediments and results in the laminarized
   transport (III). For the simulation with a very significant hindered
   settling effect due to a low gelling concentration, results also
   indicate the occurrence of gelling ignition, a state in which the
   erosion rate is always higher than the deposition rate. A sufficient
   condition for the occurrence of gelling ignition is hypothesized for a
   range of wave intensities as a function of sediment/floc properties and
   erodibility parameters. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Microcosm horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands (HSSFCWs) were
   used to examine the impacts of vegetation on nitrogen dynamics treating
   different influent COD/N ratios (1:1, 4:1, and 8:1). An increase in the
   COD/N ratio led to increased reductions in NO3 and total inorganic
   nitrogen (TIN) in planted and unplanted wetlands, but diminished removal
   of NH4. The HSSFCW planted with Canna indica L. exhibited a significant
   reduction in NH4 compared to the unplanted system, particularly in the
   active root zone where NH4 removal performance increased by up to 26 \%
   at the COD/N ratio of 8:1. There was no significant difference in NO3
   removal between the planted and unplanted wetlands. TIN removal
   efficiency in the planted wetland increased with COD/N ratios, which was
   likely influenced by plant uptake. NH4 reductions were greater in
   planted wetland at the 20- and 40-cm depths while NO3 reductions were
   uniformly greater with depth in all cases, but no statistical difference
   was impacted by depth on TIN removal. These findings show that planting
   a HSSFCW can provide some benefit in reducing nitrogen loads in
   effluents, but only when a sufficient carbon source is present.}},

Abstract = {{Previous results have shown experimental evidence that the muscle
   response to neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is delayed; the
   time lag is often referred to as electromechanical delay. NMES
   closed-loop control methods have been developed to compensate for a
   known constant input delay. However, as a muscle fatigues, this delay
   increases. This paper develops a feedback controller that robustly
   compensates for the time-varying delay of an uncertain muscle model
   during isometric contractions. The controller is proven to yield global
   uniformly ultimately bounded torque tracking error. Experimental results
   illustrate the effectiveness of the developed controller and the
   time-varying nature of the delayed response.}},

Abstract = {{As the number of combined-cycle units increases, efficient modeling
   approaches for these units play important roles for independent system
   operators (ISOs). Based on various combinations of combustion turbines
   (CTs) and steam turbines (STs), the combined-cycle unit could work at
   different configurations (modes) with different efficiencies. In this
   paper, we propose an edge-based formulation for the combined-cycle units
   in the unit commitment problem to improve the accuracy and effectiveness
   of current modeling approaches. Our formulation can 1) clearly describe
   the transition processes among different configurations so as to satisfy
   the ISO financial offer submission requirements and (2) capture physical
   constraints of each turbine, including the exact min-up/down time and
   time dependent startup cost, in the combined-cycle units so as to
   increase the operational flexibility while ensuring system feasibility.
   This model fits well with the current U.S. deregulated electricity
   market. The final numerical studies show that our approaches perform
   better than the current configuration-based modeling approach.}},

Abstract = {{The advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in the smart grid provides
   real-time information to both grid operators and customers, exploiting
   the full potential of demand response (DR). However, it introduces new
   privacy threats to customers. Prior works have proposed
   privacy-preserving methods in the AMI, such as temporal or spatial
   aggregation. A main assumption in these works is that fine-grained data
   do not need to be attributable to individuals. However, this assumption
   does not hold in incentive-based demand response (IDR) programs where
   fine-grained metering data are required to analyze individual demand
   curtailments, and hence, need to be attributable. In this paper, we
   propose a privacy-preserving scheme for IDR programs in the smart grid,
   which enables the DR provider to compute individual demand curtailments
   and DR rewards while preserving customer privacy. Moreover, a customer
   can reveal his/her identity and prove ownership of his/her power usage
   profile in certain situations, such as legal disputes. We achieve both
   privacy and efficiency in our scheme through a combination of several
   cryptographic primitives, such as identity-committable signatures and
   partially blind signatures. As far as we know, we are the first to
   identify and address privacy issues for IDR programs in the smart grid.}},

Abstract = {{Increased functional density with shrinking technology could result in
   escalating power supply noise (PSN)-induced failures in the field.
   Furthermore, the low correlation between system-level functional test
   and production test is making it difficult to better screen parts that
   would fail in the field due to PSN. To address these issues, in this
   paper, we present a fully digital on-chip distributed sensor network to
   continuously monitor the PSN profile across the chip and generate a
   trace for diagnosis of any noise-induced failure at silicon validation,
   structural test, system test, and functional operation phases of system
   on chips (SoCs). The sensors capture PSN at a fine granularity and store
   the SoC's critical status bits. The sensor offers easy access and
   control with the aid of scan chains. The sensor network has been
   designed in the 28-nm standard cell library, and its performance is
   demonstrated in the physical design of OpenSPARCT1 multicore processor
   SoC.}},

Abstract = {{For 45-nm technologies and below, the maximum operation frequency of
   integrated circuits (ICs) has reached multiple gigahertz. At the same
   time, the size of modern ICs has increased significantly with several
   billions of transistors integrated on each die. When a large number of
   transistors switch at the same time, high current consumption is
   generated. The high current consumption combining with the parasitic
   resistance and inductance of the power supply network generates a
   significant power supply noise peak, which causes abnormal reset and
   generates excessive radiation emission, and hence needs to be accurately
   monitored, adapted, and mitigated. This paper presents a novel power
   supply noise measurement and adaptation system that can monitor the peak
   power supply noise and make dynamic adaptation within one clock cycle.
   The proposed system has been implemented in Nangate 45-nm technology. It
   has been proved that the proposed measurement and the adaptation system
   can successfully avoid the performance degradation or functional failure
   due to excessive power supply noise. The peak power supply noise
   monitoring accuracy is 5 mV. The adaptation reaction time is 75\%-100\%
   of single system clock cycle. The proposed system is robust against
   temperature and process variation, and of negligible area overhead and
   power consumption.}},

Abstract = {{An application of two-dimensional (2D) time-domain full waveform
   tomography is presented to evaluate existing foundations using

   profiles. The FWI technique was applied on both synthetic and real
   experimental data sets. Inverted results of synthetic data revealed that
   individual embedded foundation elements (piles) and soil between piles
   were distinguished. For real experimental data, seismic surface wave
   fields were measured next to two drilled shafts with a 1.2-m diameter
   and a 15-m length and then inverted by the FWI technique. The waveform
   analysis successfully profiled embedded shaft elements and subsurface

Title = {{Preferential activation of CO near hydrocarbon chains during
   Fischer-Tropsch synthesis on Ru}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{337}},
Pages = {{91-101}},

Abstract = {{We report here theoretical evidence for an enhancement in CO activation
   to form C-1 monomers at locations near growing hydrocarbon chains as a
   result of their ability to disrupt the dense monolayers of chemisorbed
   CO{*} present during Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS). These previously
   unrecognized routes become favored at the high CO{*} coverages that
   prevail on curved cluster surfaces at conditions of FTS practice and
   account for the rapid growth of chains, which requires a source of
   vicinal monomers. CO activation initially requires a vacant site (and
   consequently CO{*} desorption) and proceeds via CO{*} reactions with
   H{*} to form hydroxymethylene (CH{*}OH{*}), which then dissociates to
   form OH{*} and CH{*}: CH; species can subsequently act as monomers and
   insert into chains, a process denoted as the `carbene' mechanism. These
   CH{*}, and their larger alkylidyne (CnH2n-1{*}) homologs, disrupt the
   dense CO{*} adlayers and in doing so allow the facile formation of
   vicinal CH{*}OH{*} intermediates that mediate CO activation, without
   requiring, in this case, CO{*} desorption. This causes CO{*} activation
   effective enthalpy and free energy barriers to be similar to 100 and
   similar to 15 kJ mol(-1) lower, respectively, near growing chains than
   within unperturbed monolayers. These effects are observed near
   alkylidyne (CnH2n-1{*}) but not alkylidene (CnH2n{*}) or alkyl
   (CnH2n-1{*}) chains. These phenomena cause monomers to form
   preferentially near growing alkylidyne chains, instead of forming at
   undisrupted regions of CO{*} monolayers, causing chain growth (via
   CHX{*}-insertion) to occur much more rapidly than chain initiation, a
   requirement to form long chains. Such routes resolve the seemingly
   contradictory proposals that CHx{*} species act as monomers (instead of
   CO{*}) and chain initiators, but their formation and diffusion on dense
   CO{*} adlayers must occur much faster than chain initiation for such
   chains to grow fast and reach large average lengths. Chains disrupt
   surrounding molecules in the adlayer, causing faster monomer formation
   precisely at locations where they can readily react with growing chains.
   This work illustrates how interactions between transition states and
   co-adsorbates can dramatically affect predicted rates and selectivities
   at the high coverages relevant to practical catalysis. Published by

   Ongoing research seeks to determine if current superalloy casting

   mechanical test specimens seeks to identify the role of casting defects
   and microstructural features on the fracture mechanisms of the specimen
   conditions analyzed, and in particular, evidence of bifilm formation and
   the chemical composition(s) of oxide bifilms. Analyzed tensile and
   fatigue data did not indicate an influence of bifilms on the tensile or

Journal = {{PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Single-layer thin film coatings have been deposited on steel substrates
   and tested for their corrosion resistance. These coatings include TiN,
   ZrO2, TiO2, Al2O3, and MoS2, and it is proposed that they will act as
   barriers to provide protection to the steel canisters that are part of
   the dry cask storage system for high level nuclear waste. Corrosion
   testing was completed using electrochemical potentiodynamic polarization
   techniques in aerated 1 M NaCl solution. Results show an exponential
   increase in corrosion rate with increasing temperature and an
   exponential decrease in the passive breakdown overpotential, which is
   directly related to the ability of a material to form and sustain a
   corrosion-inhibiting passive film in a given environment. Additionally,
   kinetic activation parameters have been experimentally determined for
   each material, leading to predictive equations for corrosion rates. The
   bare and coated samples corrode analogously, indicative of pores
   allowing the coating and substrate to corrode simultaneously. The
   samples were also placed in circulating salt brines of varying pH as a
   supplementary corrosion testing mechanism to explore their corrosivity
   over extended time. Negligible weight change was experienced by the bare
   and coated steel samples over a period of 5 months. Increasing the
   coating thickness and the number of layers may provide higher resistance
   to uniform and localized corrosion. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Pages = {{471-479}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Evaluate the effects of supplemental fixation elements on the
   mechanical properties of a single ring circular fixator construct.
   Study Design: In vitro mechanical testing.
   Sample population: Five construct configurations (six replicates of each
   configuration) were used to stabilize a 1.6 cmdiameter Delrin rod bone
   model.
   Methods: Constructs were assembled using 66 mm complete rings, 1.6 mm
   olive wires, and 3.2 mm diameter half-pins. Construct configurations
   tested were a base single ring construct, constructs with 1 supplemental
   drop wire or constructs with 1, 2, or 3 supplemental half-pins.
   Constructs were loaded in axial compression, caudocranial and
   mediolateral bending, and torsion. Strain was measured in individual
   fixation elements during axial loading.
   Results: A supplemental drop wire or half-pin significantly increased
   bending and torsional stiffness. The supplemental half-pin increased
   caudocranial stiffness significantly more than placing a drop wire.
   Placing a 2nd or 3rd pin afforded significantly greater increases in
   construct stiffness in all modes of loading, with 3 half-pin constructs
   having significantly greater axial and caudocranial stiffness than 2
   half-pin constructs. Placing a single supplemental pin induced
   cantilever bending resulting in angular displacement of the Delrin rod
   during axial loading and high strain in both the fixation wire secured
   distal to the ring and the pin. Supplemental half-pins incrementally
   reduced strain in all fixation elements and resulted in linear
   displacement of the Delrin rod during axial loading.
   Conclusion: If using supplemental half-pins as fixation elements,
   insertion of 2 or 3 pins is preferred over a single pin.}},

Title = {{Soil moisture distribution under drip irrigation and seepage for potato
   production}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{169}},
Pages = {{183-192}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Keeping soil moisture content at field-capacity in the root zone tends
   to maximize crop yield. However, this is challenging in sandy soils with
   a shallow water table and low water holding capacity. Seepage irrigation
   (SEP) relies on capillarity water movement from a water table to
   irrigate the crop, creating uneven soil moisture distribution across the
   field, which could be improved with drip irrigation. The objectives of
   this study were to evaluate irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) for
   potatoes and soil moisture distribution uniformity of two drip tape
   installation depths (surface at 0.05 m, SUR and subsurface at 0.15 m,
   SUB) as an alternative method to SEP. The design of the experiment was a
   randomized complete block with irrigation treatments as main plots, and
   potato varieties (Atlantic, Fabula, and Red LaSoda) as subplots. The
   volume of water applied, water table level, and soil volumetric water
   content were continuously measured for two seasons, 2011 and 2012. Drip
   irrigation significantly increased the moisture distribution uniformity
   in the potato ridge. The majority of the plant root system was
   concentrated in the upper soil layer (similar to 0.3 m), regardless of
   irrigation treatment. Similar marketable yield between SUR and SEP were
   achieved for Fabula and Atlantic in the first season, while lower yields
   were reported for Red LaSoda under drip in both years. The SUB produced
   lower yield in both years attributed to limited water capillarity. Drip
   irrigation reduced water use 48\% and 88\% in 2011 and 2012,
   respectively. Higher IWUE was obtained with drip compared to SEP for all
   varieties in 2012. The SEP used more irrigation water to supply the crop
   than SUR resulting in a difference in IWUE of 5.7 kg m(-3). The SUR was
   capable of adequately irrigating the potato shallow root producing
   similar yield to SEP for Atlantic and Fabula varieties. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{This work introduces a real time suboptimal control algorithm for
   six-degree-of-freedom spacecraft maneuvering based on a
   State-Dependent-Algebraic-Riccati-Equation (SDARE) approach and
   real-time linearization of the equations of motion. The control strategy
   is sub-optimal since the gains of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR)
   are re-computed at each sample time. The cost function of the proposed
   controller has been compared with the one obtained via a general purpose
   optimal control software, showing, on average, an increase in control
   effort of approximately 15\%, compensated by real-time implement
   ability. Lastly, the paper presents experimental tests on a
   hardware-in-the-loop six degree-of-freedom spacecraft simulator,
   designed for testing new guidance, navigation, and control algorithms
   for nano-satellites in a one-g laboratory environment. The tests show
   the real-time feasibility of the proposed approach. (C) 2016 IAA.

Title = {{Exact MIP-based approaches for finding maximum quasi-cliques and dense

Abstract = {{Given a simple graph and a constant , a -quasi-clique is defined as a
   subset of vertices that induces a subgraph with an edge density of at
   least . This well-known clique relaxation model arises in a variety of
   application domains. The maximum -quasi-clique problem is to find a
   -quasi-clique of maximum cardinality in the graph and is known to be
   NP-hard. This paper proposes new mixed integer programming (MIP)
   formulations for solving the maximum -quasi-clique problem. The
   corresponding linear programming (LP) relaxations are analyzed and shown
   to be tighter than the LP relaxations of the MIP models available in the
   literature on sparse graphs. The developed methodology is naturally
   generalized for solving the maximum -dense subgraph problem, which, for
   a given function , seeks for the largest k such that there is a subgraph
   induced by k vertices with at least f(k) edges. The performance of the
   proposed exact approaches is illustrated on real-life network instances
   with up to 10,000 vertices.}},

Abstract = {{Atmospheric dispersion theory can be used to predict ground deposition
   of particulates downwind of a radionuclide release. This paper uses
   standard formulations found in Gaussian plume models to inform the
   design of an experimental release of short-lived radioactive particles
   into the atmosphere. Specifically, a source depletion algorithm is used
   to determine the optimum particle size and release height that maximizes
   the near-field deposition while minimizing both the required source
   activity and the fraction of activity lost to long-distance transport.
   The purpose of the release is to provide a realistic deposition pattern
   that might be observed downwind of a small-scale vent from an
   underground nuclear explosion. The deposition field will be used, in
   part, to study several techniques of gamma radiation survey and
   spectrometry that could be used by an On-Site Inspection team
   investigating such an event.}},

Abstract = {{A radioactive particulate release experiment to produce a near-field
   ground deposition representative of small-scale venting from an
   underground nuclear test was conducted to gather data in support of
   treaty capability development activities. For this experiment, a
   CO2-driven air cannon was used to inject La-140, a radioisotope of
   lanthanum with 1.7-d half-life and strong gamma-ray emissions, into the
   lowest levels of the atmosphere at ambient temperatures. Witness plates
   and air samplers were laid out in an irregular grid covering the area
   where the plume was anticipated to deposit based on climatological wind
   records. This experiment was performed at the Nevada National Security
   Site, where existing infrastructure, radiological procedures, and
   support personnel facilitated planning and execution of the work. A
   vehicle-mounted NaI(Tl) spectrometer and a polyvinyl toluene-based
   backpack instrument were used to survey the deposited plume. Hand-held
   instruments, including NaI(Tl) and lanthanum bromide scintillators and
   high purity germanium spectrometers, were used to take in situ
   measurements. Additionally, three soil sampling techniques were
   investigated and compared. The relative sensitivity and utility of
   sampling and survey methods are discussed in the context of on-site

Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{150}},
Pages = {{694-701}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The potential for rice husk (RH) and wood chip (WC) biochars to remove
   levofloxacin (LEV) from aqueous solution was evaluated. The physical and
   chemical properties of the biochars were characterized using various
   tools and techniques. Furthermore, batch sorption experiments were
   conducted to determine the sorption ability of the biochars to LEV. The
   pseudo-second order kinetic model described the sorption kinetic data
   better than the pseudo-first order kinetic model and the Elovich
   equation because the process involved both surface adsorption and pore
   diffusion. For the isotherms, the Langmuir equation fitted the data
   better than the Freundlich equation. The maximum Langmuir sorption
   capacities of the biochars to LEV ranged from 1.49 to 7.72 mg g(-1).
   Thermodynamic parameters obtained from the experiments showed that the
   adsorption of LEV onto the WC biochar was spontaneous and exothermic,
   while its adsorption onto the RH biochar was spontaneous and endothermic
   under tested conditions. A mixture of 0.025 M phosphate buffer (80\%, pH
   3.0) and acetonitrile (20\%) effectively desorbed the LEV from the
   biochars with a recovery rate up to 80\%. Findings from this work
   indicate that biochars can be used as an alternative adsorbent to
   effectively remove emerging contaminants including LEV from aqueous
   solutions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{There is an increasing need to develop novel and high-efficiency water
   purification technologies. This work systematically evaluated the
   potential of using graphene oxide (GO) directly as filter media for the
   removal of levofloxacin (LEV), an emerging contaminate, and lead (Pb), a
   heavy metal, from aqueous solution. Batch and fixed-bed experiments were
   conducted to determine the sorption behaviors of LEV and Pb onto the GO.
   In the batch system, GO showed strong sorption of the two contaminants
   with Langmuir maximum adsorption capacities of 256.6 and 227.2 mg g(-1),
   respectively. The removal of LEV and Pb by GO in fixed-bed columns was
   high under all tested conditions in both single and mixed solution
   systems. The removal efficiency of the two contaminants in the GO-sand
   columns increased with increasing GO content, but decreased with
   increasing injection flow rate. In the mixed solution system, although
   LEV and Pb competed for sorption, the GO media still had high removal
   efficiencies for them. The column experimental data were well described
   by the Bed Depth Service Time (BDST) model, suggesting the model can be
   used for the design of GO-sand filters in large-scale applications.
   Findings from this work demonstrated that GO is a promising
   nano-adsorbent that can be used as a high efficiency filter media in
   water treatment to remove hazardous metal elements and emerging
   contaminants. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Testing the responses of four wheat crop models to heat stress at
   anthesis and grain filling}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Higher temperatures caused by future climate change will bring more
   frequent heat stress events and pose an increasing risk to global wheat
   production. Crop models have been widely used to simulate future crop
   productivity but are rarely tested with observed heat stress
   experimental datasets. Four wheat models (DSSAT-CERES-Wheat,
   DSSAT-Nwheat, APSIM-Wheat, and WheatGrow) were evaluated with 4years of
   environment-controlled phytotron experimental datasets with two wheat
   cultivars under heat stress at anthesis and grain filling stages. Heat
   stress at anthesis reduced observed grain numbers per unit area and
   individual grain size, while heat stress during grain filling mainly
   decreased the size of the individual grains. The observed impact of heat
   stress on grain filling duration, total aboveground biomass, grain
   yield, and grain protein concentration (GPC) varied depending on
   cultivar and accumulated heat stress. For every unit increase of heat
   degree days (HDD, degree days over 30 degrees C), grain filling duration
   was reduced by 0.30-0.60\%, total aboveground biomass was reduced by
   0.37-0.43\%, and grain yield was reduced by 1.0-1.6\%, but GPC was
   increased by 0.50\% for cv Yangmai16 and 0.80\% for cv Xumai30. The
   tested crop simulation models could reproduce some of the observed
   reductions in grain filling duration, final total aboveground biomass,
   and grain yield, as well as the observed increase in GPC due to heat
   stress. Most of the crop models tended to reproduce heat stress impacts
   better during grain filling than at anthesis. Some of the tested models
   require improvements in the response to heat stress during grain
   filling, but all models need improvements in simulating heat stress
   effects on grain set during anthesis. The observed significant genetic
   variability in the response of wheat to heat stress needs to be
   considered through cultivar parameters in future simulation studies.}},

Abstract = {{An estimation method known as least absolute shrinkage and selection
   operator (LASSO) or l(1)-regularized LS estimation has been found to
   perform well in a number of applications. In this paper, we use the
   majorize-minimize method to develop an algorithm for minimizing the
   LASSO objective function, which is the sum of a linear LS objective
   function plus an l(1) penalty term. The proposed algorithm, which we
   call the LASSO estimation via majorization-minimization (LMM) algorithm,
   is straightforward to implement, parallelizable, and guaranteed to
   produce LASSO objective function values that monotonically decrease. In
   addition, we formulate an extension of the LMMalgorithm for
   reconstructing ground penetrating radar (GPR) images, that is much
   faster than the standard LMM algorithm and utilizes significantly less
   memory. Thus, the GPR specific LMM(GPR-LMM) algorithm is able to
   accommodate the big data associated with GPR imaging. We compare our
   proposed algorithms to the state-of-the-art l(1)-regularized LS
   algorithms using a time and space complexity analysis. The GPR-LMM
   greatly outperforms the competing algorithms in terms of the performance
   metrics we considered. In addition, the reconstruction results of the
   standard LMM and GPR-LMM algorithms are evaluated using both simulated
   and real GPR data.}},

   a spatially resolved quasi-particle detector. The detector consists of
   an array of micro-machined resonators, which are sensitive to

   micro-machined resonators, which have been successfully used to study
   superfluid He-B and He. Presented here is the design of the detector and

Abstract = {{Biodegradable magnesium (Mg) alloys combine the advantages of
   traditional metallic implants and biodegradable polymers, having high
   strength, low density, and a stiffness ideal for bone fracture fixation.
   A recently developed Mg-Ca-Sr alloy potentially possesses advantageous
   characteristics over other Mg alloys, such as slower degradation rates
   and minimal toxicity. In this study, the biocompatibility of this
   Mg-Ca-Sr alloy was investigated in a rat pin-placement model.
   Cylindrical pins were inserted in the proximal tibial metaphyses in
   pre-drilled holes orthogonal to the tibial axis. Implant and bone
   morphologies were investigated using mu CT at 1, 3, and 6 weeks after
   implant placement. At the same time points, the surrounding tissue was
   evaluated using H\&E, TRAP and Goldner's trichrome staining. Although
   gas bubbles were observed around the degrading implant at early time
   points, the bone remained intact with no evidence of microfracture.
   Principle findings also include new bone formation in the area of the
   implant, suggesting that the alloy is a promising candidate for
   biodegradable orthopedic implants. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

Title = {{Arsenic release from Floridan Aquifer rock during incubations simulating
   aquifer storage and recovery operations}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{551}},
Pages = {{238-245}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{While aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) is becoming widely accepted as
   a way to address water supply shortages, there are concerns that it may
   lead to release of harmful trace elements such as arsenic (As). Thus,
   mechanisms of As release from limestone during ASR operations were
   investigated using 110-day laboratory incubations of core material
   collected from the Floridan Aquifer, with treatment additions of labile
   or refractory dissolved organic matter (DOM) or microbes. During the
   first experimental phase, core materials were equilibrated with native
   groundwater lacking in DO to simulate initial non-perturbed anaerobic
   aquifer conditions. Then, ASR was simulated by replacing the native
   groundwater in the incubations vessels with DO-rich ASR source water,
   with DOM or microbes added to some treatments. Finally, the vessels were
   opened to the atmosphere to mimic oxidizing conditions during later
   stages of ASR.
   Arsenic was released from aquifer materials, mainly during transitional
   periods at the beginning of each incubation stage. Most As released was
   during the initial anaerobic experimental phase via reductive
   dissolution of Fe oxides in the core materials, some or all of which may
   have formed during the core storage or sample preparation period.
   Oxidation of As-bearing Fe sulfides released smaller amounts of As
   during the start of later aerobic experimental phases. Additions of
   labile DOM fueled microbially-mediated reactions that mobilized As,
   while the addition of refractory DOM did not, probably due to mineral
   sorption of DOM that made it unavailable for microbial utilization or
   metal chelation. The results suggest that oscillations of groundwater
   redox conditions, such as might be expected to occur during an ASR
   operation, are the underlying cause of enhanced As release in these
   systems. Further, ASR operations using DOM-rich surface waters may not
   necessarily lead to additional As releases. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Multiaxial quasi-static and dynamic compression experiments were
   performed on zirconium diboride-5wt\% silicon carbide (ZrB2-5wt\%SiC)
   ceramic composite processed via spark plasma sintering technique.
   Cylindrical ZrB2-SiC specimens were confined using thick walled metal
   sleeves to generate various levels of confinement pressure on the
   lateral surface and then subjected to axial loads under quasi-static and
   dynamic conditions. Postmortem analysis revealed formation of a
   macroscopic shear plane in the recovered specimens and slip bands within
   ZrB2 grains. Compressive strengths of up to 5.6 GPa and 9.8 GPa,
   respectively, were reached under quasi-static and dynamic strain rates.
   To capture the strain rate dependent and pressure dependent response the
   Johnson-Holmquist (JH-2) model was used and relevant parameters were
   determined for future high velocity impact or shock response simulations
   utilizing the experimental data generated from low and high strain rate
   confined compression tests. A comparison of JH-2 model constants for
   ZrB2-SiC along with other structural ceramics revealed that pressure
   alone plays a deterministic role in defining the constitutive response
   of all brittle ceramics including ZrB2-SiC. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

   filter, aiming to overcome the compromise between convergence speed and
   steady state mean square error of the NFSLMS algorithm, offers both fast
   convergence rate and low steady state error. Furthermore, by replacing
   the sigmoid function with the modified Versorial function, the modified
   CNFSLMS (MCNFSLMS) algorithm with low computational complexity is also
   presented. Experimental results illustrate that the combination scheme
   can behave as well as the best component and even better. Moreover, the
   MCNFSLMS algorithm requires less computational complexity than the
   CNFSLMS while keeping the same filtering performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Direct integration of a vertical organic field-effect transistor (VOFET)
   and an optoelectronic device offers a single stacked, low power
   optoelectronic VOFET with high aperture ratios. However, a functional
   optoelectronic VOFET could not be realized because of the difficulty in
   fabricating transparent source and gate electrodes. Here, we report a
   VOFET with an on/off ratio up to 10(5) as well as output current
   saturation by fabricating a transparent gate capacitor consisting of a
   perforated indium tin oxide (ITO) source electrode, HfO2 gate
   dielectric, and ITO gate electrode. Effects of the pore size and the
   pore depth within the porous ITO electrodes on the on/off characteristic
   of a VOFET are systematically explained in this work. By combining a
   phosphorescent organic light-emitting diode with an optimized VOFET
   structure, a vertical organic light-emitting transistor with a luminance
   on/off ratio of 10(4) can be fabricated.}},

   phase reveal an unstable mode whose zone-center eigenvector corresponds
   to a rigid rotation of the BO4 tetrahedra, in agreement with previous
   calculations based on a short-range model potential. A possible
   switching path between two symmetry-equivalent ferroelectric phases that
   goes through the high-temperature paraelectric phase is identified and
   used to calculate the spontaneous polarization. The theoretical value
   for the spontaneous polarization calculated using the modern theory of
   polarization is 4.9 mu C cm(-2) for the PBEsol + U functional, which

Abstract = {{Centimeter-scale gold nanoparticle (Au NP) monolayer films have been

   recently developed approach, drain to deposit, is demonstrated to be
   most effective in transferring the Au NP films from the water/organic
   solvent interface to various solid substrates while maintaining their
   integrity. The interparticle spacing was tuned from 1.4 to 3.1 rim using
   alkylamine ligands of different lengths. The ordering of the films
   increased with increasing ligand length. The surface plasmon resonance
   and the in-plane electrical conductivity of the Au NP films both exhibit
   an exponential dependence on the interparticle spacing. These findings
   show great potential in scaling up the manufacturing of high-performance
   optical and electronic devices based on two-dimensional metallic

Title = {{The International Deep Brain Stimulation Registry and Database for

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{APR 25}},
Abstract = {{Tourette Syndrome (TS) is a neuropsychiatric disease characterized by a
   combination of motor and vocal tics. Deep brain stimulation (DBS),
   already widely utilized for Parkinson's disease and other movement
   disorders, is an emerging therapy for select and severe cases of TS that
   are resistant to medication and behavioral therapy. Over the last two
   decades, DBS has been used experimentally to manage severe TS cases. The
   results of case reports and small case series have been variable but in
   general positive. The reported interventions have, however, been
   variable, and there remain non-standardized selection criteria, various
   brain targets, differences in hardware, as well as variability in the
   programming parameters utilized. DBS centers perform only a handful of
   TS DBS cases each year, making large-scale outcomes difficult to study
   and to interpret. These limitations, coupled with the variable effect of
   surgery, and the overall small numbers of TS patients with DBS
   worldwide, have delayed regulatory agency approval (e.g., FDA and
   equivalent agencies around the world). The Tourette Association of
   America, in response to the worldwide need for a more organized and
   collaborative effort, launched an international TS DBS registry and
   database. The main goal of the project has been to share data, uncover
   best practices, improve outcomes, and to provide critical information to
   regulatory agencies. The international registry and database has
   improved the communication and collaboration among TS DBS centers
   worldwide. In this paper we will review some of the key operation
   details for the international TS DBS database and registry.}},

Month = {{APR 22}},
Abstract = {{We perform discrete element simulations of homogeneous shearing of
   frictionless cylinders and show that the particles are characterized by
   orientational order and form a granular liquid crystal. For elongated
   and flat cylinders, the alignment is in the plane of shearing, while
   cylinders having an aspect ratio equal to 1 and 0.8 show no
   orientational order. We show that the particle pressure is insensitive
   to the cylinder aspect ratio and well predicted by the kinetic theory of
   granular gases, with a singularity in the radial distribution function
   at contact different from that for frictionless spheres. The numerical
   results quantitatively agree with physical experiments on different
   geometries. The particle shear stress is affected by orientational
   anisotropy. We postulate that, for frictionless cylinders, the viscosity
   is roughly due to the motion of the orientationally disordered fraction
   of the particles, and show that it is proportional, through the order
   parameter, to the expression of kinetic theory. Finally, we suggest that
   the orientational order is the result of the competing effects of the
   shear rate, which induces alignment, and the granular temperature, which
   ramdomizes.}},

   Networks}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEURAL CIRCUITS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Transient propagation of information across neuronal assembles is
   thought to underlie many cognitive processes. However, the nature of the
   neural code that is embedded within these transmissions remains
   uncertain. Much of our understanding of how information is transmitted
   among these assemblies has been derived from computational models. While
   these models have been instrumental in understanding these processes
   they often make simplifying assumptions about the biophysical properties
   of neurons that may influence the nature and properties expressed. To
   address this issue we created an in vitro analog of a feed-forward
   network composed of two small populations (also referred to as
   assemblies or layers) of living dissociated rat cortical neurons. The
   populations were separated by, and communicated through, a
   microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) device containing a strip of
   microscale tunnels. Delayed culturing of one population in the first
   layer followed by the second a few days later induced the unidirectional
   growth of axons through the microtunnels resulting in a primarily
   feed-forward communication between these two small neural populations.
   In this study we systematically manipulated the number of tunnels that
   connected each layer and hence, the number of axons providing
   communication between those populations. We then assess the effect of
   reducing the number of tunnels has upon the properties of between-layer
   communication capacity and fidelity of neural transmission among spike
   trains transmitted across and within layers. We show evidence based on
   Victor-Purpura's and van Rossum's spike train similarity metrics
   supporting the presence of both rate and temporal information embedded
   within these transmissions whose fidelity increased during communication
   both between and within layers when the number of tunnels are increased.
   We also provide evidence reinforcing the role of synchronized activity
   upon transmission fidelity during the spontaneous synchronized network
   burst events that propagated between layers and highlight the potential
   applications of these MEMs devices as a tool for further investigation
   of structure and functional dynamics among neural populations.}},

Abstract = {{Silicon nanowires (SiNWs) are appealing building blocks in various
   applications, including photovoltaics, photonics, and sensors.
   Fabricating SiNW arrays with diameters < 100 nm remains challenging
   through conventional top-down approaches. In this work, chemical etching
   and thermal oxidation are combined to fabricate vertically aligned,
   sub-20 nm SiNW arrays. Defect-free SiNWs with diameters between 95 and
   200 nm are first fabricated by nanosphere (NS) lithography and chemical
   etching. The key aspects for defect-free SiNW fabrication are identified
   as: (1) achieving a high etching selectivity during NS size reduction;
   (2) retaining the circular NS shape with smooth sidewalls; and (3) using
   a directional metal deposition technique. SiNWs with identical spacing
   but variable diameters are demonstrated by changing the reactive ion
   etching power. The diameter of the SiNWs is reduced by thermal
   oxidation, where self-limiting oxidation is encountered after oxidizing
   the SiNWs at 950 degrees C for 1 h. A second oxidation is performed to
   achieve vertically aligned, sub-20 nm SiNW arrays. Si/SiO2 core/shell
   NWs are obtained before removing the oxidized shell. HRTEM imaging shows
   that the SiNWs have excellent crystallinity.}},

   Hydrogenolysis of n-Alkanes}},

Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{8125-8138}},
Month = {{APR 21}},
Abstract = {{C-C cleavage in C-2-C-10 n-alkanes involves quasi equilibrated C-H
   activation steps to form dehydrogenated intermediates on surfaces
   saturated with H atoms. These reactions are inhibited by H-2 to similar
   extents for C-C bonds of similar substitution in all acyclic and cyclic
   alkanes and, thus, show similar kinetic dependences on H-2 pressure.
   Yet, turnover rates depend sensitively on chain length because of
   differences in activation enthalpies (Delta H double dagger) and
   entropies (Delta S double dagger) whose mechanistic origins remain
   unclear. Density functional theory (DFT) estimates of Delta H double
   dagger and Delta G double dagger for C-C cleavage via >150 plausible
   elementary steps for propane and n-butane reactants on Ir show that
   hydrogenolysis occurs via alpha,beta-bound RC{*}-C{*}R'double dagger
   transition states (R = H, CxH2x+1) in which two H atoms are removed from
   each C{*}. Calculated Delta H double dagger values decrease with
   increasing alkane chain length (C-2-C-8), consistent with experiment,
   because attractive van der Waals interactions with surfaces
   preferentially stabilize larger transition states. A concomitant
   increase in Delta S double dagger, evident from experiments, is not
   captured by periodic DFT methods, which treat low-frequency vibrational
   modes inaccurately, but statistical mechanics treatments describe such
   effects well for RC{*}-C{*}R double dagger species, as previously
   reported. These findings, together with parallel studies of the cleavage
   of more substituted C-C bonds in branched and cyclic alkanes, account
   for the reasons that chain length and substitution influence Delta H
   double dagger and Delta S double dagger values and the dependence of
   rates on H-2 pressure and consequently explain differences in
   hydrogenolysis reactivities and selectivities across all alkanes.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{202}},

Abstract = {{Florida is ranked third in total cabbage production in the U.S. and it
   is traditionally grown on bare ground with subirrigation. The use of
   plastic mulch and drip irrigation is widespread for other vegetable
   crops and can enhance water and fertilizer use efficiency and yield. The
   objective of the study was to evaluate plant growth, yield and head
   quality traits of cabbage using three plant populations and four
   planting dates on a plastic mulch system. Cabbage was transplanted in
   mid September (SEP), mid October (OCT), early November (NOV), and early
   December (DEC) in the 2013-14 and 2014-15 growing seasons, spanning the
   entire planting season for commercial operations in northeast Florida.
   There was no interaction among planting dates and plant populations for
   total and marketable yields or biomass. For both seasons, the SEP and
   OCT plantings showed a faster growth rate than NOV and DEC during the
   first 70 days after transplanting; however, differences in total biomass
   accumulation were only seen in 2013-14. Biomass decreased quadratically
   in 2013-14 with an increase in in-row spacing. Average marketable yield
   for both years was 62.7, 60.5, 46.2, and 58.6 Mg ha(-1) for SEP, OCT,
   NOV and DEC, respectively. As plant population decreased, marketable
   yield increased linearly in 2013-14 while no differences were seen in
   marketable yield among plant population treatments during 2014-15
   season. Plant growth rate and yield were correlated to growing season
   average air temperature and solar radiation. The SEP, OCT and DEC
   planting dates benefited from more favorable weather conditions, while
   low air temperatures and reduced solar radiation had a negative effected
   on cabbage yield for the NOV planting. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Chlorine disinfection of wastewater was investigated to determine the
   reaction rate constant of the disinfection process at the Kanapaha Water
   Reclamation Facility in Gainesville, FL. Chlorine reactions with
   wastewater occurred in the contact basin, and they could be
   characterized by partial differential equations (PDEs). In addition to
   the difficulties of the solution of these PDEs, the determination of the
   reaction rate constant of chlorine disinfection is also difficult
   because of complex reactions with ammonia and the dynamic behavior of
   wastewater. These vary depending on the influent ammonia concentration,
   chlorine dosage, and wastewater content and flow rate. A method of
   characteristics and an odometric transformation technique were applied
   to these equations to more easily obtain a solution. The method of
   characteristics is a mathematical solution technique that transforms a
   PDE into an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Because the
   disinfection reaction also has a large and variable time delay, the
   odometric transformation technique was introduced to eliminate this
   obstacle. The application of these mathematical solution and
   transformation techniques converted the dynamics of the system into a
   constant time-delay model and a set of ODEs. To validate the model and
   determine the reaction rate constant by simulation, the resulting
   equations were coded in Matlab and solved numerically. The validation
   was performed by a comparison of the simulated response of the developed
   model with the experimental data using Matlab software packages. The
   validation criterion was the obtainment of the highest fit (\%) for the
   simulated result. The simulation results revealed that the fit (\%) was
   the highest when the reaction rate constant was 0.0074h(-1).}},

Title = {{Insights into the mechanisms of mercury sorption onto aluminum based

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{307}},
Pages = {{184-192}},

Abstract = {{Several studies have demonstrated the ability of drinking water
   treatment residuals (WTRs) to efficiently sorb metal cations from
   aqueous solutions. Reported results have stimulated interest on the
   potential use of WTRs as sorbent for metal removal from contaminated
   aqueous effluents as well as in metal immobilization in contaminated
   soils. However, knowledge on mechanisms of metal sorption by WTRs
   remains very limited and data on the long-term stability of formed
   metal-WTR complexes as a function of changing key environmental
   parameters are lacking. In this study, chemical selective sequential
   extraction (SSE), scanning electron microscopy combined with X-ray
   energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM-EDS), and X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS) were used to gain insight into the different
   mechanisms of mercury (Hg) binding to aluminum based WTR (Al-WTRs).
   Results from sorption studies show that a significant portion of Hg
   becomes incorporated in the operationally defined residual fraction of
   Al-WTRs, and therefore, not prone to dissolution and mobility. The
   results of solid phase analyses suggested that Hg immobilization by
   Al-WTR occurs largely through its binding to oxygen donor atoms of
   mineral ligands driven by a combination of electrostatic forces and
   covalent bonding. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Field-scale crop models are increasingly applied at spatio-temporal
   scales that range from regions to the globe and from decades up to 100
   years. Sufficiently detailed data to capture the prevailing
   spatio-temporal heterogeneity in weather, soil, and management
   conditions as needed by crop models are rarely available. Effective
   sampling may overcome the problem of missing data but has rarely been
   investigated. In this study the effect of sampling weather data has been
   evaluated for simulating yields of winter wheat in a region in Germany
   over a 30-year period (1982-2011) using 12 process-based crop models. A
   stratified sampling was applied to compare the effect of different sizes
   of spatially sampled weather data (10, 30, 50,100, 500, 1000 and full
   coverage of 34,078 sampling points) on simulated wheat yields.
   Stratified sampling was further compared with random sampling. Possible
   interactions between sample size and crop model were evaluated.
   The results showed differences in simulated yields among crop models but
   all models reproduced well the pattern of the stratification.
   Importantly, the regional mean of simulated yields based on full
   coverage could already be reproduced by a small sample of 10 points.
   This was also true for reproducing the temporal variability in simulated
   yields but more sampling points (about 100) were required to accurately
   reproduce spatial yield variability. The number of sampling points can
   be smaller when a stratified sampling is applied as compared to a random
   sampling. However, differences between crop models were observed
   including some interaction between the effect of sampling on simulated
   yields and the model used. We concluded that stratified sampling can
   considerably reduce the number of required simulations. But, differences
   between crop models must be considered as the choice for a specific
   model can have larger effects on simulated yields than the sampling
   strategy. Assessing the impact of sampling soil and crop management data
   for regional simulations of crop yields is still needed. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The chemical characteristics of airborne particulate matter (PM) have
   been extensively studied; however, little information exists for its
   biological components (bioaerosol) especially during a haze event in
   mega cities. Herein, we studied the bioaerosol (fluorescent particle)
   dynamics on both haze and sunny days in Beijing from Dec. 2013 to March
   2014 by employing a widely used real-time bioaerosol sensor -ultraviolet
   aerodynamic particle spectrometer (UV-APS). Firstly, we studied the
   fluorescent particle (BioPM) concentration and size distributions during
   three independent haze and three independent sunny days. Secondly, we
   investigated BioPM dynamics over a two-week long monitoring period which
   included consecutive haze days and alternated sunny clays. In addition,
   we analyzed bacterial community structures and endotoxin levels in the
   air samples using pyrosequencing and Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL)
   method, respectively.
   More than 6-fold higher fluorescent particle concentrations up to 5 x
   10(5)/m(3) with peaks at night or early dawn were detected at the time
   of haze occurrences than those observed on sunny clays. When the haze
   episode progressed for 3-5 days, the BioPM concentrations were observed
   to decrease to the levels that were typically observed on sunny clays.
   In general, ozone levels were found to be elevated at noon, while BioPM.
   NO and relative humidity were reduced. Gene sequence analysis revealed
   no significant difference in abundances and community structures for top
   13 bacterial genera between haze and sunny days, yet about twice higher
   endotoxin levels (12.4 EU/m(3)) were detected on haze days than on sunny
   days.The results here facilitate a better understanding of atmospheric
   fluorescent particle dynamics including those under haze events. (C)

Abstract = {{Silver nanowires (AgNWs) mesh has been used as transparent electrodes in
   optoelectronic devices. However, the lack of practical patterning
   techniques for the random percolating nanowire network has limited its
   applications in devices where a well-defined pixel is required. Here, by
   controlling the surface wetting properties of a polydimethylsiloxane
   (PDMS) release template, we are able to pattern the random AgNWs network
   with uniform conducting property; and due to the hydrophobic recovery
   nature of PDMS, a multilayer patterning and transferring process can be
   realized, resulting in a fine-patterned, smooth, and uniform AgNWs
   mesh/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)
   composite electrode. A thermal-evaporated organic light-emitting diode
   (OLED) is directly fabricated onto the patterned AgNWs/PEDOT:PSS
   composite electrode. The device shows well-defined pixel edges and a
   uniformly lighted pixel area. A uniform OLED with very low leakage
   current is realized. The enhanced efficiency compared to the controlled
   device with prepatterned indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode is attributed
   to the scattering effects of the AgNWs electrode.}},

Abstract = {{The nonlinear, metastable dynamics of the brain are essential for
   large-scale integration of smaller components and for the rapid
   organization of neurons in support of behavior. Therefore, understanding
   the nonlinearity of the brain is paramount for understanding the
   relationship between brain dynamics and behavior. Explicit quantitative
   descriptions of the properties and consequences of nonlinear neural
   networks, however, are rare. Because the local field potential (LFP)
   reflects the total activity across a population of neurons,
   nonlinearites of the nervous system should be quantifiable by examining
   oscillatory structure. We used high-order spectral analysis of LFP
   recorded from the dorsal and intermediate regions of the rat hippocampus
   to show that the nonlinear character of the hippocampal theta rhythm is
   directly related to movement speed of the animal. In the time domain,
   nonlinearity is expressed as the development of skewness and asymmetry
   in the theta shape. In the spectral domain, nonlinear dynamics manifest
   as the development of a chain of harmonics statistically phase coupled
   to the theta oscillation. This evolution was modulated across
   hippocampal regions, being stronger in the dorsal CA1 relative to more
   intermediate areas. The intensity and timing of the spiking activity of
   pyramidal cells and interneurons was strongly correlated to theta
   nonlinearity. Because theta is known to propagate from dorsal to ventral
   regions of the hippocampus, these data suggest that the nonlinear
   character of theta decreases as it travels and supports a hypothesis
   that activity dissipates along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of the oligothiophene length of two thiophene-isoindigo
   copolymers on film morphology, charge transfer, and photovoltaic device
   performance are reported. Despite the similarities in their repeat unit
   structures, the two polymers show distinctly different film morphologies
   and photovoltaic performance upon blending with PC71BM. We found that
   there is a significant increase in the dielectric constant of the
   photoactive film upon blending fullerene with the polymer that exhibits
   a higher power conversion efficiency. Blend photoluminescence transients
   revealed a fast dissociation route in the better performing polymer
   followed by a slower decay. The fast decay in transient PL is attributed
   to a higher charge transfer efficiency when blending with the fullerene.
   We suggest that the charge transfer efficiency is determined not only by
   the microscopic morphology but also whether the polymer can accommodate
   the fullerene molecules in close proximity to the acceptor moiety to
   facilitate electronic coupling between the isoindigo acceptor and the
   fullerene molecule. We propose that the fast decay component seen in
   transient PL for the better performing polymer, along with the increase
   in dielectric constant, is a signature of enhanced electronic coupling
   between the polymer and the fullerene. The enhanced electronic coupling
   is thought to originate from a polymer chemical structure which allows
   the fullerene molecules to come to closer proximity for more efficient
   charge transfer.}},

Title = {{Impact of Spatial Soil and Climate Input Data Aggregation on Regional

Abstract = {{We show the error in water-limited yields simulated by crop models which
   is associated with spatially aggregated soil and climate input data.
   Crop simulations at large scales (regional, national, continental)
   frequently use input data of low resolution. Therefore, climate and soil
   data are often generated via averaging and sampling by area majority.
   This may bias simulated yields at large scales, varying largely across
   models. Thus, we evaluated the error associated with spatially
   aggregated soil and climate data for 14 crop models. Yields of winter
   wheat and silage maize were simulated under water-limited production
   conditions. We calculated this error from crop yields simulated at
   spatial resolutions from 1 to 100 km for the state of North
   Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Most models showed yields biased by <15\%
   when aggregating only soil data. The relative mean absolute error (rMAE)
   of most models using aggregated soil data was in the range or larger
   than the inter-annual or inter-model variability in yields. This error
   increased further when both climate and soil data were aggregated.
   Distinct error patterns indicate that the rMAE may be estimated from few
   soil variables. Illustrating the range of these aggregation effects
   across models, this study is a first step towards an ex-ante assessment
   of aggregation errors in large-scale simulations.}},

Title = {{Compensatory Neural Activity in Response to Cognitive Fatigue}},

Pages = {{3919-3924}},

Abstract = {{Prolonged continuous performance of a cognitively demanding task induces
   cognitive fatigue and is associated with a time-related deterioration of
   objective performance, the degree of which is referred to cognitive
   fatigability. Although the neural underpinnings of cognitive fatigue are
   poorly understood, prior studies report changes in neural activity
   consistent with deterioration of task-related networks over time. While
   compensatory brain activity is reported to maintain motor task
   performance in the face of motor fatigue and cognitive performance in
   the face of other stressors (e.g., aging) and structural changes, there
   are no studies to date demonstrating compensatory activity for cognitive
   fatigue. High-density electroencephalography was recorded from human
   subjects during a 160 min continuous performance of a cognitive control
   task. While most time-varying neural activity showed a linear decline
   over time, we identified an evoked potential over the anterior frontal
   region which demonstrated an inverted U-shaped time-on-task profile.
   This evoked brain activity peaked between 60 and 100 min into the task
   and was positively associated with better behavioral performance only
   during this interval. Following the peak and during subsequent decline
   of this anterior frontal activity, the rate of performance decline also
   accelerated. These findings demonstrate that this anterior frontal brain
   activity, which is not part of the primary task-related activity at
   baseline, is recruited to compensate for fatigue-induced impairments in
   the primary task-related network, and that this compensation terminates
   as cognitive fatigue further progresses. These findings may be relevant
   to understanding individual differences in cognitive fatigability and
   developing interventions for clinical conditions afflicted by fatigue.}},

Abstract = {{Computationally characterizing magnetic properies of novel
   two-dimensional (2D) materials serves as an important first step of
   exploring possible applications. Using density-functional theory, we
   show that single-layer Fe3GeTe2 is a potential 2D material with
   sufficiently low formation energy to be synthesized by mechanical
   exfoliation from the bulk phase with a van der Waals layered structure.
   In addition, we calculated the phonon dispersion demonstrating that
   single-layer Fe3GeTe2 is dynamically stable. Furthermore, we find that
   similar to the bulk phase, 2D Fe3GeTe2 exhibits amagnetic moment that
   originates from a Stoner instability. In contrast to other 2D materials,
   we find that single-layer Fe3GeTe2 exhibits a significant uniaxial
   magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy of 920 mu eV per Fe atom
   originating from spin-orbit coupling. Finally, we show that applying
   biaxial tensile strains enhances the anisotropy energy, which reveals
   strong magnetostriction in single-layer Fe3GeTe2 with a sizable
   magneostrictive coefficient. Our results indicate that single-layer
   Fe3GeTe2 is potentially useful for magnetic storage applications.}},

Abstract = {{Microstructural and mechanical characterization investigations on three
   variants of a through-hardened M50 bearing steel are presented to
   compare and contrast their performances under rolling contact fatigue
   (RCF) loading. Baseline (BL) variant of M50 steel bearing balls is
   subjected to: (i) a surface nitriding treatment and (ii) a surface
   mechanical processing treatment, to obtain distinct microstructures and
   mechanical properties. These balls are subjected to RCF loading for
   several hundred million cycles at two different test temperatures, and
   the subsequent changes in subsurface hardness and compressive
   stress-strain response are measured. It was found that the RCF-affected
   subsurface regions grow larger in size at higher temperature.
   Micro-indentation hardness measurements within the RCF-affected regions
   revealed an increase in hardness in all the three variants. The size of
   the RCF-affected region and intensity of hardening were the largest in
   the BL material and smallest in the mechanically processed (MP)
   material. Based on Goodman's diagram, it is shown that the compressive
   residual stress reduces the effective fully reversed alternating stress
   amplitude and thereby retards the initiation and evolution of subsurface
   plasticity within the material during RCF loading. It is quantitatively
   shown that high material hardness and compressive residual stress are
   greatly beneficial for enhancing the RCF life of bearings.}},

Abstract = {{High-speed video images of 24 downward negative lightning flashes
   terminating on tall structures in Guangzhou are selected to analyse the
   connecting behaviour of the downward and upward leaders during the
   attachment process preceding the first return stroke. Three types of
   leader connecting behaviour have been observed: Type I, the tip of
   downward leader (DL) to the tip of upward connecting leader (UCL), which
   accounts for 42\% of all the events (10/24); Type II, the DL's tip to
   the lateral surface of UCL, which accounts for 50\% (12/24); and Type
   III, the combination of Types I and II, which accounts for 8\% (2/24).
   For the two cases of Type III behaviour, each case had two junction
   points (one with Type I and the other with Type II behaviour) between
   the downward and upward leaders. Therefore, Types I and II can be viewed
   as the two basic types of the leader connecting behaviour during the
   attachment process in negative lightning. No attachment process
   exhibited the connection of the UCL's tip to the lateral surface of DL.
   The presence of multiple DL branches and their integrated effect on the
   development of positive UCL/UCLs are likely to be the main reasons for
   the Type II behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{The use of post-tensioning tendons with flexible filler is expected to
   increase in U. S. bridges in the coming years as an alternative to
   grouted tendons. Flexible filler results in purely unbonded behavior
   when used with either internal or external tendons, which creates
   opportunities for the application of tendon monitoring techniques that
   were not possible with grouted tendons. One such technique is the
   detection of wire breakage based on the strain response of the
   post-tensioning anchorage. The encouraging results from simplified
   laboratory experiments and analytical models in support of the proposed
   method motivated the full-scale experiments reported in this paper.
   Tests were conducted with flexible filler in both external and internal
   tendons in I-girder specimens having deviated multi-strand tendon
   profiles, allowing the investigation of the effects of deviators on
   stress recovery and anchor strain response. The strands of the
   post-tensioned girders were detensioned by individual wire cuts and the
   resulting changes in anchor strain distribution were captured. Finally,
   a broken strand identification algorithm developed for automated damage
   detection was applied to the experimental results. In addition to
   instrumenting the anchors with strain gauges, an acoustic sensing system
   was employed to independently monitor and confirm the breakage events.
   The findings reported in this study suggest that the wire breakage
   detection method based on anchor strain measurement can be a reliable
   and cost-effective approach for in-field bridge monitoring applications.}},

Title = {{Controlled release of a heterogeneous human placental matrix from PLGA

Abstract = {{A significant hurdle limiting musculoskeletal tissue regeneration is the
   inability to develop effective vascular networks to support cellular
   development within engineered constructs. Due to the inherent complexity
   of angiogenesis, where multiple biochemical pathways induce and control
   vessel formation, our laboratory has taken an alternate approach using a
   matrix material containing angiogenic and osteogenic proteins derived
   from human placental tissues. Single bolus administrations of the human
   placental matrix (hPM) have been shown to initiate angiogenesis but
   vascular networks deteriorated over time. Controlled/sustained delivery
   was therefore hypothesized to stabilize and extend network formation. To
   test this hypothesis, hPM was encapsulated in degradable
   poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microparticles to extend the
   release period. Microparticle preparation including loading, size,
   encapsulation efficiency, and release profile was optimized for hPM. The
   angiogenic cellular response to the hPM/PLGA-loaded microparticles was
   assessed in 3D alginate hydrogel matrices seeded with primary human
   endothelial cells. Results show an average microparticle diameter of
   91.82 +/- 2.92 mu m, with an encapsulation efficiency of 75 \%, and a
   release profile extending over 30 days. Three-dimensional angiogenic
   assays with hPM-loaded PLGA microparticles showed initial stimulation of
   angiogenic tubules after 14 days and further defined network formations
   after 21 days of culture. Although additional optimization is necessary,
   these studies confirm the effectiveness of a novel controlled
   multi-protein release approach to induce and maintain capillary networks
   within alginate tissue scaffolds.}},

Abstract = {{Traffic signal control at roundabouts is proved to be effective in
   addressing heavy traffic. However, the applicability of a signalised
   roundabout, especially compared with a signalised intersection, in terms
   of capacity has not been investigated. For signalised roundabouts,
   unsignalised roundabout capacity models including gap-acceptance
   theories and regression models are not applicable. This study first
   introduces a shockwave-based model to capture the impacts of signals at
   circulatory lanes on queuing and clearance time of left-turning
   vehicles. On this basis, a general signal timing model and a capacity
   model are developed. A sensitivity analysis is then elaborated to test
   how temporal and spatial parameters affect the capacity of a signalised
   roundabout. Capacity comparisons are made among signalised roundabouts,
   unsignalised roundabouts and signalised intersections. The results show
   that (i) under high traffic demand, a signalised roundabout outperforms
   an unsignalised roundabout; (ii) a signalised roundabout achieve higher
   capacity than a signalised intersection does under certain condition,
   (iii) but a signalised intersection outperforms a signalised roundabout
   when optimal cycle length is relatively short (65 seconds in this
   study), (iv) capacity of a signalised roundabout is very sensitive to
   the variation of signal parameters, hence care should be taken to design
   the parameters to ensure high capacity.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Optical and magnetic encoders are widely used to measure joint angles.
   These sensors are required to be installed at the axes of rotation
   (joint centers). However, microelectro-mechanical system (MEMS)
   accelerometer and gyroscope-based joint angle measurement sensors
   possess the advantage of being flexible with regard to the point of
   installation. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) are capable of providing
   orientation and are also used for joint angle estimation. They
   conventionally fuse gyroscope and accelerometer data using Kalman
   filter-like algorithm to estimate the joint angles. This research
   presents a novel approach of measuring joint parameters-joint angles,
   angular velocities, and accelerations, of two links joined by revolute
   or universal joint. The gravity-invariant vestibular dynamic
   inclinometer (VDI) and planar VDI (pVDI) are used on each link to
   measure the joint parameters of links joined by revolute and universal
   joints, respectively. The VDI consists of two dual-axis accelerometers
   and an uniaxial gyroscope, while the pVDI consists of four strategically
   placed dual-axis accelerometers and a triaxial gyroscope. The
   measurements of joint parameters using the presented algorithms are
   independent of integration errors/drift, do not require knowledge of
   robot dynamics, and are computationally less burdensome.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{As climate change has become a global concern and server energy demand
   continues to soar, many IT companies have started to explore server
   clusters running on various renewable energy sources. Existing green
   data center designs often yield suboptimal performance as they only look
   at a certain specific type of energy source. This article explores data
   centers powered by hybrid renewable energy systems. We propose
   GreenWorks, a framework for HPC data centers running on a renewable
   energy mix. Specifically, GreenWorks features a cross-layer power
   management scheme tailored to the timing behaviors and capacity
   constraints of different energy sources. Using realistic workload traces
   and renewable energy data, we show that GreenWorks could provide a
   near-optimal workload performance (within 3\% difference) on average. It
   can also reduce the worst-case performance degradation by 43\% compared
   to the state-of-the-art design. Moreover, the performance improvements
   are based on carbon-neutral operations and are not at the cost of
   significant efficiency degradation and reduced battery lifecycle. Our
   technique becomes more efficient when servers become more energy
   proportional and can effectively handle the ever-increasing depth of
   renewable power penetration in green data centers.}},

Abstract = {{Explosives detection is carried out with a novel spectral analysis
   technique referred to as differential laser-induced perturbation
   spectroscopy (DLIPS) on thin films of TNT, RDX, HMX, and PETN. The
   utility of Raman spectroscopy for detection of explosives is enhanced by
   inducing deep ultraviolet laser perturbation on molecular structures in
   combination with a differential Raman sensing scheme. Principal
   components analysis (PCA) is used to quantify the DLIPS method as
   benchmarked against a traditional Raman scattering probe, and the
   related photo-induced effects on the molecular structure of the targeted
   explosives are discussed in detail. Finally, unique detection is
   observed with TNT samples deposited on commonly available background
   substrates of nylon and polyester. Overall, the data support DLIPS as a
   noninvasive method that is promising for screening explosives in
   real-world environments and backgrounds.}},

Abstract = {{An ensemble Kalman Filter-based data assimilation framework that links a
   crop growth model with active and passive (AP) microwave models was
   developed to improve estimates of soil moisture (SM) and vegetation
   biomass over a growing season of soybean. Complementarities in AP
   observations were incorporated to the framework, where the active
   observations were used to optimize surface roughness and update
   vegetation biomass, while passive observations were used to update SM.
   The framework was implemented in a rain-fed agricultural region of the
   southern La-Plata Basin during the 2011-2012 growing season, through a
   synthetic experiment and AP observations from the Aquarius mission. The
   synthetic experiment was conducted at a temporal resolution of 3 and 7
   days to match the current AP missions. The assimilated estimates of SM
   in the root zone and dry biomass were improved compared to those from
   the cases without assimilation, during both 3- and 7-day assimilation
   scenarios. Particularly, the 3-day assimilation provided the best
   estimates of SM in the near surface and dry biomass with reductions in
   RMSEs of 41\% and 42\%, respectively. The absolute differences of
   assimilated LAI from Aquarius were < 0.29 compared to the MODIS LAI
   indicating that the performance of assimilation was similar to the MODIS
   product at a regional scale. This study demonstrates the potential of
   assimilation using AP observations at high temporal resolution such as
   those from soil moisture active passive (SMAP) for improved estimates of
   SM and vegetation parameters.}},

Abstract = {{We report on Cu/Ni paired superlattice conductors featuring reduced
   radio frequency (RF) loss based on eddy current cancelling (ECC). Also,
   the effects of the width and the individual layer thickness of the
   superlattice conductors have been studied for improved RF performance.
   The usage of Ni as the ferromagnetic material in the
   non-ferromagnetic/ferromagnetic superlattice structure is advantageous
   as it has a high contrast between the in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic
   coercivity fields making it suitable for effective thin film
   superlattice ECC, is abundant, and does not require a stoichiometric
   control of composition as other alloy magnetic materials do. Ni's
   negative permeability is also able to effectively cancel out the
   positive permeability of copper in the frequency of interest. A
   transmission line consisting of 10 superlatticeCu/Ni layers, with each
   layer being of 150 nm/25 nm totaling 1.75 mu m shows the same resistance
   value as one consisting of 10 Cu/Ni layers with each being 600 nm/100 nm
   totaling 7 mu m thick at 13 GHz, revealing 75\% conductor volume
   reduction. Experimental results showmore than three times improvement in
   the figure of merit defined as frequency/effective resistivity, compared
   with other state-of-the-art devices.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is focused on the development and analysis of suboptimal
   decision algorithms for a collection of robots that assist a remotely
   located operator in perimeter surveillance. The operator is tasked with
   the classification of incursions across the perimeter. whenever there is
   an incursion into the perimeter, an unattended ground sensor (UGS) in
   the vicinity, signals an alert. A robot services the alert by visiting
   the alert location, collecting information, e.g., photo and video
   imagery, and transmitting it to the operator. The accuracy of operator's
   classification depends on the volume and freshness of information
   gathered and provided by the robots at locations where incursions occur.
   There are two competing objectives for a robot: it needs to spend
   adequate time at an alert location to collect evidence for aiding the
   operator in accurate classification but it also needs to service other
   alerts as soon as possible, so that the evidence collected is relevant.
   The decision problem is to determine the optimal amount of time a robot
   must spend servicing an alert. The incursions are stochastic and their
   statistics are assumed to be known. This problem can be posed as a
   Markov Decision Problem. However, even for two robots and five UGS
   locations, the number of states is of the order of billions rendering
   exact dynamic programming methods intractable. Approximate dynamic
   programming (ADP) via linear programming (LP) provides a way to
   approximate the value function and derive suboptimal strategies. The
   novel feature of this paper is the derivation of a tractable lower bound
   via LP and the construction of a suboptimal policy whose performance
   improves upon the lower bound. An illustrative perimeter surveillance
   example corroborates the results derived in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Rhynchophorus ferrugineus ( Olivier) ( Coleoptera: Dryophthoridae)
   larvae are cryptic, internal tissue- feeding pests of palm trees that
   are difficult to detect; consequently, infestations may remain hidden
   until they are widespread in an orchard. Infested trees and propagable
   offshoots that develop from axillary buds on the trunk frequently are
   transported inadvertently to previously uninfested areas. Acoustic
   methods can be used for scouting and early detection of R. ferrugineus,
   but until now have not been tested on multiple trees and offshoots in
   commercial date palm orchard environments. For this report, the acoustic
   detectability of R. ferrugineus was assessed in Saudi Arabian date palm
   orchards in the presence of commonly occurring wind, bird noise,
   machinery noise, and nontarget insects. Signal analyses were developed
   to detect R. ferrugineus and another insect pest, Oryctes elegans Prell
   ( Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), frequently co- occurring in the orchards,
   and discriminate both from background noise. In addition, it was
   possible to distinguish R. ferrugineus from O. elegans in offshoots by
   differences in the temporal patterns of their sound impulses. As has
   been observed often with other insect pests, populations of the two
   species appeared clumped rather than uniform or random. The results are
   discussed in relation to development of automated methods that could
   assist orchard managers in quickly identifying infested trees and
   offshoots so that R. ferrugineus infestations can be targeted and the
   likelihood of transferring infested offshoots to uninfested areas can be
   reduced.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Center for Devices
   and Radiological Health (CDRH) believes it is important to help
   stakeholders (e.g., manufacturers, health-care professionals, patients,
   patient advocates, academia, and other government agencies) navigate the
   regulatory landscape for medical devices. For innovative devices
   involving brain-computer interfaces, this is particularly important.
   Approach. Towards this goal, on 21 November, 2014, CDRH held an open
   public workshop on its White Oak, MD campus with the aim of fostering an
   open discussion on the scientific and clinical considerations associated
   with the development of brain-computer interface (BCI) devices, defined
   for the purposes of this workshop as neuroprostheses that interface with
   the central or peripheral nervous system to restore lost motor or
   sensory capabilities. Main results. This paper summarizes the
   presentations and discussions from that workshop. Significance. CDRH
   plans to use this information to develop regulatory considerations that
   will promote innovation while maintaining appropriate patient
   protections. FDA plans to build on advances in regulatory science and
   input provided in this workshop to develop guidance that provides
   recommendations for premarket submissions for BCI devices. These
   proceedings will be a resource for the BCI community during the
   development of medical devices for consumers.}},

Abstract = {{Although sarcopenia, age-associated loss of muscle mass and strength, is
   neither accelerated nor exacerbated by depletion of muscle stem cells,
   satellite cells, we hypothesized that adaptation in sarcopenic muscle
   would be compromised. To test this hypothesis, we depleted satellite
   cells with tamoxifen treatment of Pax7(CreER)-DTA mice at 4 months of
   age, and 20 months later subjected the plantaris muscle to 2 weeks of
   mechanical overload. We found myofiber hypertrophy was impaired in aged
   mice regardless of satellite cell content. Even in the absence of
   growth, vehicle-treated mice mounted a regenerative response, not
   apparent in tamoxifen-treated mice. Further, myonuclear accretion
   occurred in the absence of growth, which was prevented by satellite cell
   depletion, demonstrating that myonuclear addition is insufficient to
   drive myofiber hypertrophy. Satellite cell depletion increased
   extracellular matrix content of aged muscle that was exacerbated by
   overload, potentially limiting myofiber growth. These results support
   the idea that satellite cells regulate the muscle environment, and that
   their loss during aging may contribute to fibrosis, particularly during
   periods of remodeling. Overload induced a fiber-type composition
   improvement, independent of satellite cells, suggesting that aged muscle
   is very responsive to exercise-induced enhancement in oxidative
   capacity, even with an impaired hypertrophic response.}},

Abstract = {{Large sampling uncertainty is generally introduced in the calculation of
   a low percentile of fatigue crack growth life due to a small number of
   coupon tests. It is often desirable to estimate a low percentile (for
   example, 10th percentile) with a certain coverage probability (for
   example, 95\%) using the confidence bound approach. An equally competing
   objective is not to have overly conservative bounds. The performance of
   two bootstrap-based methods are investigated for calculating a one-sided
   95\% confidence bound on a low percentile of lognormal and gamma fatigue
   crack growth life distributions. A comparison is also made with the
   classical tolerance interval method and nonparametric (Hanson-Koopmans)
   method. These confidence bounds methods are tested to estimate B-basis
   fatigue crack growth design life using material properties estimated
   from coupon test samples ranging from 8 to 64.}},

Abstract = {{Unknown fruit motion due to exogenous disturbances such as wind gust,
   canopy unloading, and particularly, fruit detachment forces can reduce
   overall harvesting efficiency in robotic fruit harvesting. Existing
   approaches relying on high-gain controllers to compensate for fruit
   motion are inherently susceptible to measurement noise and can lead to
   instability. The contribution of this paper is in the development of a
   robust image-based visual servo controller to regulate a robotic
   manipulator to a target fruit in the presence of unknown fruit motion.
   The robust feedback elements included in the control structure
   compensate for non-vanishing nonlinear disturbances without the need for
   high-gain feedback. Lyapunov-based stability analysis guarantees
   uniformly ultimately bounded regulation of the robot end-effector to a
   target fruit. In addition, finite-time convergence analysis is presented
   to show that the controller gains can be chosen to achieve the desired
   fruit removal rate, or cycle time. Numerical simulations with varying
   fruit displacement of \{35, 70, 105, 140, 175,210\} mm verify the
   feasibility of the developed controller while the performance is
   evaluated on a seven degrees-of-freedom kinematically redundant
   manipulator using an artificial citrus fruit moving with 120 mm
   displacement. The developed robust controller demonstrates stable
   closed-loop operation of the system. Further, the effect of
   uncertainties in field conditions such as illumination variations and
   partial fruit occlusion, overlapping fruit, and obstacles on the
   developed controller, are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology has many applications
   in inventory management, supply chain, product tracking, transportation,
   and logistics. One research issue of practical importance is to search
   for a particular group of tags in a large-scale RFID system. Time
   efficiency is a crucial factor that must be considered when designing a
   tag search protocol to ensure its execution will not interfere with
   other normal inventory operations. In this paper, we design a new
   technique called filtering vector, which can significantly reduce
   transmission overhead during search process, thereby shortening search
   time. Based on this technique, we propose an iterative tag search
   protocol. In each round, we filter out some tags and eventually
   terminate the search process when the search result meets the accuracy
   requirement. Furthermore, we extend our protocol to work under noisy
   channel. The simulation results demonstrate that our protocol performs
   much better than the best existing work.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, in online social networks (OSNs), the least cost influence
   (LCI) problem has become one of the central research topics. It aims at
   identifying a minimum number of seed users who can trigger a wide
   cascade of information propagation. Most of existing literature
   investigated the LCI problem only based on an individual network.
   However, nowadays users often join several OSNs such that information
   could be spread across different networks simultaneously. Therefore, in
   order to obtain the best set of seed users, it is crucial to consider
   the role of overlapping users under this circumstances. In this article,
   we propose a unified framework to represent and analyze the influence
   diffusion in multiplex networks. More specifically, we tackle the LCI
   problem by mapping a set of networks into a single one via lossless and
   lossy coupling schemes. The lossless coupling scheme preserves all
   properties of original networks to achieve high-quality solutions, while
   the lossy coupling scheme offers an attractive alternative when the
   running time and memory consumption are of primary concern. Various
   experiments conducted on both real and synthesized datasets have
   validated the effectiveness of the coupling schemes, which also provide
   some interesting insights into the process of influence propagation in
   multiplex networks.}},

Abstract = {{The connectivity of moving vehicles is one of the key metrics in
   vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) that critically influences the
   performance of data transmission. Due to lack of in-depth analysis of
   real-world vehicular mobility traces, we do not understand the
   connectivity in realistic large-scale urban scenarios. Specifically, the
   mechanism of how the mobility of networked vehicles impacts the network
   connectivity remains unknown. In this paper, we aimto unveil the
   underlying relationship between the mobility and connectivity of VANETs.
   To achieve this goal, we employ some key topology metrics, including
   component speed and component size, to characterize mobility and
   connectivity. In our investigation of a large-scale real-world urban
   mobility trace data set, we discover, to our surprise, that there exists
   a dichotomy in the relationship between component speed and size. This
   dichotomy indicates that mobility destroys the connectivity with a
   power-law decline when the component speed is larger than a threshold;
   otherwise, it has no apparent impact on connectivity. Based on this
   observation, we propose a mathematical model to characterize this
   relationship, which agrees well with empirical results. Our findings
   thus offer a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between
   mobility and connectivity in urban vehicular scenarios, and based on
   this, helpful guidelines can be provided in the design and analysis of
   VANETs.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: In scattering proton therapy, the beam incidence, i.e. the
   patient's orientation with respect to the beam axis, can significantly
   influence stray neutron doses although it is almost not documented in
   the literature.
   Methods: MCNPX calculations were carried out to estimate stray neutron
   doses to 25 healthy organs of a 10-year-old female phantom treated for
   an intracranial tumor. Two beam incidences were considered in this
   article, namely a superior (SUP) field and a right lateral (RLAT) field.
   For both fields, a parametric study was performed varying proton beam
   energy, modulation width, collimator aperture and thickness, compensator
   thickness and air gap size.
   Results: Using a standard beam line configuration for a
   craniopharyngioma treatment, neutron absorbed doses per therapeutic dose
   of 63 mu Gy Gy(-1) and 149 mu Gy Gy(-1) were found at the heart for the
   SUP and the RLAT fields, respectively. This dose discrepancy was
   explained by the different patient's orientations leading to changes in
   the distance between organs and the final collimator where external
   neutrons are mainly produced. Moreover, investigations on neutron
   spectral fluence at the heart showed that the number of neutrons was 2.5
   times higher for the RLAT field compared against the SUP field. Finally,
   the influence of some irradiation parameters on neutron doses was found
   to be different according to the beam incidence.
   Conclusion: Beam incidence was thus found to induce large variations in
   stray neutron doses, proving that this parameter could be optimized to
   enhance the radiation protection of the patient. (C) 2016 Associazione

Abstract = {{The life-cycle assessment (LCA) tool, Waste Reduction Model, currently
   applies no methane generation to landfilled polylactic acid (PLA),
   considering the carbon sequestered. A selection of PLA products were
   analyzed by the biochemical methane potential (BMP) assay, and the
   results were compared to LCA model values. BMPs were performed at 35 and
   55 degrees C on a variety of single-use products that would be disposed
   alongside food scraps. No biodegradation was observed for any product
   after incubation at 35 degrees C for 60 days. PLA products generated
   185-372 mL of CH4/g of volatile solids at 55 degrees C after 60 days,
   some approaching the theoretical methane potential. The results here
   indicate that PLA may generate significant quantities of methane in an
   anaerobic landfill environment, which can reach thermophilic
   temperatures, and the current assumption of PLA as an absolute carbon
   sink in landfills is incorrect.}},

Abstract = {{Biomarker development for osteoarthritis (OA) often begins in rodent
   models, but can be limited by an inability to aspirate synovial fluid
   from a rodent stifle (similar to the human knee). To address this
   limitation, we have developed a magnetic nanoparticle-based technology
   to collect biomarkers from a rodent stifle, termed magnetic capture.
   Using a common OA biomarker-the c-terminus telopeptide of type II
   collagen (CTXII)-magnetic capture was optimized in vitro using bovine
   synovial fluid and then tested in a rat model of knee OA. Anti-CTXII
   antibodies were conjugated to the surface of superparamagnetic iron
   oxide-containing polymeric particles. Using these anti-CTXII particles,
   magnetic capture was able to estimate the level of CTXII in 25 mu L
   aliquots of bovine synovial fluid; and under controlled conditions, this
   estimate was unaffected by synovial fluid viscosity. Following in vitro
   testing, anti-CTXII particles were tested in a rat monoiodoacetate model
   of knee OA. CTXII could be magnetically captured from a rodent stifle
   without the need to aspirate fluid and showed tenfold changes in CTXII
   levels from OA-affected joints relative to contralateral control joints.
   Combined, these data demonstrate the ability and sensitivity of magnetic
   capture for post-mortem analysis of OA biomarkers in the rat.}},

Abstract = {{Starch-stabilized nanoscale zerovalent iron (SNZVI) was used as a novel
   adsorbent for the removal of high concentration of phosphate from
   aqueous solution. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) image analysis
   showed that the presence of starch alleviated particle aggregation and
   thus increased its surface area and reactivity. Adsorption isotherms
   showed that the data were well fitted with the Langmuir model (R-2 =
   0.9956) with the maximum phosphate adsorption capacity of 322.39 mgP/g.
   Batch sorption experiments also showed that the phosphate removal by the
   SNZVI did not decrease with increasing ionic strength, and the
   interfering ions had no significant effects on the adsorption process.
   The phosphate removal ability of the SNZVI, however, decreased with
   increasing temperature and pH. In addition, when the solution pH was
   adjusted to 12, the sorbed phosphate on the SNZVI was released from the
   SNZVI with a recovery rate as high as 81.29\%. X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS) analyses indicated that the dominant mechanism of
   phosphate removal by SNZVI was surface adsorption. (C) 2016 Taiwan

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WIND ENGINEERING AND INDUSTRIAL AERODYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{151}},
Pages = {{158-168}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The estimation of peak wind pressures is important in the
   reliability-and performance-based design for low-rise buildings.
   Typically, Davenport's formula is widely used to determine the peak
   factor if the pressure approximately follows Gaussian distribution.
   Recently, the moment-based Hermite polynoMial model (HPM) is becoming
   popular to estimate the peak factor when the non-Gaussianity of wind
   pressure exists. However, their performances deserve further study based
   on the appropriate wind tunnel data. In this study, Davenport's formula
   and moment-based HPM are reviewed. The peak value of wind pressure is
   determined using very long time histories of wind pressure data to
   evaluate the performance of moment-based HPM and Davenport's formula.
   Results suggest that moment-based HPM should be adopted in the peak
   value estimation for wind pressures when the skewness and kurtosis of a
   process are sufficient to capture its non-Gaussian properties. Results
   also show that Davenport's formula may cause noticeable errors in the
   peak factor estimation for the wind pressure data close to Gaussian
   process while HPM provides a robust estimation for these data. (C) 2016

Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Each of the thousands of rare neurological diseases requires a widely
   distributed network of centres, investigators and patients, so as to
   foster multidisciplinary investigations and involve sufficient numbers
   of patients in the discovery of disease pathogenesis and novel
   treatment. In this Review, we highlight the value of this collaborative
   approach in patient-oriented research into rare neurological
   channelopathies. Two networks, the Consortium for Clinical
   Investigations of Neurological Channelopathies (CINCH) and the Clinical
   Research Consortium for Studies of Cerebellar Ataxias (CRC-SCA), provide
   a link between patients with rare channelopathies and investigators who
   are studying disease pathogenesis and developing novel treatments.
   Interactions between patients, researchers and advocacy groups promote
   shared agendas that benefit patient education and recruitment, research
   collaboration and funding, and training and mentoring of junior
   investigators who are attracted to the study of the diseases that
   provide the focus for the two networks. Here, we discuss how linkage of
   national and international centres has enabled recruitment of study
   participants, provided opportunities for novel studies of pathogenesis,
   and facilitated successful clinical trials.}},

Abstract = {{The assembly of local communities from regional pools is a multifaceted
   process that involves the confluence of interactions and environmental
   conditions at the local scale and biogeographic and evolutionary history
   at the regional scale. Understanding the relative influence of these
   factors on community structure has remained a challenge and mechanisms
   driving community assembly are often inferred from patterns of
   taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity. Moreover, community
   assembly is often viewed through the lens of competition and rarely
   includes trophic interactions or entire food webs. Here, we use motifs -
   subgraphs of nodes (e.g. species) and links (e.g. predation) whose
   abundance within a network deviates significantly as compared to a
   random network topology - to explore the assembly of food web networks
   found in the leaves of the northern pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea.
   We compared counts of three-node motifs across a hierarchy of scales to
   a suite of null models to determine if motifs are over-, under-, or
   randomly represented. We then assessed if the pattern of representation
   of a motif in a given network matched that of the network it was
   assembled from. We found that motif representation in over 70\% of site
   networks matched the continental network they were assembled from and
   over 75\% of local networks matched the site networks they were
   assembled from for the majority of null models. This suggests that the
   same processes are shaping networks across scales. To generalize our
   results and effectively use a motif perspective to study community
   assembly, a theoretical framework detailing potential mechanisms for all
   possible combinations of motif representation is necessary.}},

Abstract = {{The oxidative potential of various secondary organic aerosols (SOA) was
   measured using dithiothreitol (DTT) assay to understand how organic
   aerosols react with cellular materials. SOA was produced via the
   photooxidation of four different hydrocarbons (toluene,
   1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, isoprene and alpha-pinene) in the presence of
   NOx using a large outdoor photochemical smog chamber. The DTT
   consumption rate was normalized by the aerosol mass, which is expressed
   as DTTmass. Toluene SOA and isoprene SOA yielded higher DTTmass than
   1,3,5-trimethylbenzene SOA or alpha-pinene SOA. In order to discover the
   correlation between the molecular structure and oxidative potential, the
   DTT responses of selected model compounds were also measured. Among
   them, conjugated aldehydes, quinones, and H2O2 showed considerable DTT
   response. To investigate the correlation between DTT response and cell
   responses in vitro, the expression of biological markers, i.e. IL-6,
   IL-8, and HMOX-1 were studied using small airway epithelial cells.
   Higher cellular expression of IL-8 was observed with toluene SOA
   exposure compared to 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene SOA exposure, which aligned
   with the results from DTT assay. Our study also suggests that within the
   urban atmosphere, the contribution of toluene SOA and isoprene SOA to
   the oxidative potential of ambient SOA will be more significant than
   that of alpha-pinene SOA. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This work used the nutrient film technique to evaluate the role of
   biochar filtration in reducing the toxic effects of nickel (Ni2+) on
   tomato growth. Three hydroponic treatments: T-1 (control), T-2 (with
   Ni2+), and T-3 (with Ni2+ and biochar) were used in the experiments.
   Scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy and Fourier transform spectroscopy was used to characterize
   the pre- and post-treatment biochar samples. The results illustrated
   that precipitation, ion exchange, and complexation with surface
   functional groups were the potential mechanisms of Ni2+ removal by
   biochar. In comparison to the control, the T-2 treatment showed severe
   Ni-stress with alterations in cell wall structure, distortions in cell
   nucleus, disturbances in mitochondrial system, malformations in stomatal
   structure, and abnormalities in chloroplast structure. The biochar
   filters in T-3 treatment reduced dysfunctions of cell organelles in root
   and shoot cells. Total chlorophyll concentration decreased by 41.6\% in
   T-2 treatment. This reduction, however, was only 20.8\% due to the
   protective effect of the biochar filters. The presence of Ni2+ in the
   systems reduced the tomato fruit yield 58.5\% and 31.9\% in T-2 and T-3,
   respectively. Nickel concentrations reached the toxic limit in roots,
   shoots, and fruits in T-2, which were not observed in T-3. Biochar
   filters in T-3 also minimized the dramatic reductions in nutrients
   concentration in roots, shoots, and fruits, which occurred in T-2
   treatment due to the severe Ni-stress. Findings from this work suggested
   that biochar filters can be used on farms as a safeguard for wastewater
   irrigation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Monolayer MoS2 photodetectors are modeled and simulated by
   self-consistently solving diffusive transport equations in the presence
   of light illumination and carrier recombination with the 2-D Poisson
   equation. The simulated results indicate that very high
   photoresponsivity (PR) of similar to 1000 A/W observed in others'
   experiments is due to strong electrostatic effect of pile up of
   optically generated holes, and efficient optical absorption. It is found
   that the value of PR is sensitive to gate bias voltage, and the
   photodetector performance can be improved by decreasing hole mobility if
   side effects of low hole mobility, such as high recombination rate, slow
   response speed, and more noise, are suppressed. High quality monolayer
   MoS2 with large electron mobility and less Shockley-Read-Hall
   recombination defects is desired for achieving high performance. The PR
   increases as the gate insulator thickness increases. The channel length
   needs to be carefully designed by considering the carrier recombination
   behavior in monolayer MoS2. The optimization method of monolayer MoS2
   photodetectors proposed here is also applicable to other monolayer
   transition-metal dichalcogenide materials in general.}},

Abstract = {{The recycling of electronic components has become a major industrial and
   governmental concern, as it could potentially impact the security and
   reliability of a wide variety of electronic systems. It is extremely
   challenging to detect a recycled integrated circuit (IC) that is already
   used for a very short period of time because the process variations
   outpace the degradation caused by aging, especially in lower technology
   nodes. In this paper, we propose a suite of solutions, based on
   lightweight negative bias temperature instability (NBTI)-aware ring
   oscillators (ROs), for combating die and IC recycling (CDIR) when ICs
   are used for a very short duration. The proposed solutions are
   implemented in the 90-nm technology node. The simulation results
   demonstrate that our newly proposed NBTI-aware multiple pair RO-based
   CDIRs can detect ICs used only for a few hours.}},

Abstract = {{Realistic versus stylized depictions of virtual humans in simulated
   inter-personal situations and their ability to elicit emotional
   responses in users has been an open question for artists and researchers
   alike. We empirically evaluated the effects of near visually realistic
   vs. non-realistic stylized appearance of virtual humans on the emotional
   response of participants in a medical virtual reality system that was
   designed to educate users in recognizing the signs and symptoms of
   patient deterioration. In a between subjects experiment protocol,
   participants interacted with one of three different appearances of a
   virtual patient, namely visually realistic, cartoon-shaded and
   charcoal-sketch like conditions in a mixed reality simulation. Emotional
   impact were measured via a combination of quantitative objective
   measures were gathered using skin Electrodermal Activity (EDA) sensors,
   and quantitative subjective measures such as the Differential Emotion
   Survey (DES IV), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and
   Social Presence questionnaire. The emotional states of the participants
   were analyzed across four distinct time steps during which the medical
   condition of the virtual patient deteriorated (an emotionally stressful
   interaction), and were contrasted to a baseline affective state.
   Objective EDA results showed that in all three conditions, male
   participants exhibited greater levels of arousal as compared to female
   participants. We found that negative affect levels were significantly
   lower in the visually realistic condition, as compared to the stylized
   appearance conditions. Furthermore, in emotional dimensions of
   interest-excitement, surprise, anger, fear and guilt participants in all
   conditions responded similarly. However, in social emotional constructs
   of shyness, presence, perceived personality, and enjoyment-joy, we found
   that participants responded differently in the visually realistic
   condition as compared to the cartoon and sketch conditions. Our study
   suggests that virtual human appearance can affect not only critical
   emotional reactions in affective inter-personal training scenarios, but
   also users' perceptions of personality and social characteristic of the
   virtual interlocutors.}},

   we explore whether one group member's agency (e.g. if they are real or

   also consider whether variations in the agency of a group member
   directly affects behavior with that group member. To do so. we examined
   gaze behavior during a team training exercise. in which sixty-nine
   nurses worked with a surgeon and an anesthesiologist to prepare a
   simulated patient for surgery. The agency of the surgeon and the
   anesthesiologist were varied between conditions. Nurses' gaze behavior
   was coded using videos of their interactions. Agency was observed to
   directly affect behavior, such that participants spent more time gazing
   at virtual teammates than human teammates. However, participants
   continued to obey polite gaze norms with virtual teammates. In contrast,
   agency was not observed to indirectly affect gaze behavior. The presence
   of a second human did not affect participants' gaze behavior with
   virtual teammates.}},

Abstract = {{Single crystals of the noncentrosymmetric KNaNbOF5 polymorph were grown

   measurements yielded a d(33) value of +/- 6.3 pCN(-1) and an effective

   range 1960-2080 kHz. Crystals of KNaNbOF5 were found to exhibit a strong
   triboluminscence effect visible to the naked eye as blue sparks when
   crystals are crushed. This triboluminescence effect is uncommon in that
   it is likely independent from both the piezoelectric effect and
   atmospheric electrical discharge. Instead, triboluminescence may

Abstract = {{Due to concerns about adverse health effects associated with inhalation
   of atmospheric polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 30 ambient air
   samples were obtained at an air quality monitoring station in Palm Beach
   County, Florida, from March 2013 to March 2014. The ambient PAH
   concentration measurements and fractional emission rates of known
   sources were incorporated into a chemical mass balance model, CMB8.2,
   developed by EPA, to apportion contributions of three major PAH sources
   including preharvest sugarcane burning, mobile vehicles, and wildland
   fires. Strong association between the number of benzene rings and source
   contribution was found, and mobile vehicles were identified to be the
   prevailing source (contribution >= 56\%) for the observed PAHs
   concentration with lower molecular weights (four or fewer benzene rings)
   throughout the year. Preharvest sugarcane burning was the primary
   contributing source for PAHs with relatively higher molecular weights
   (five or more benzene rings) during the sugarcane burning season (from
   October to May of the next year). Source contribution of wildland fires
   varied among PAH compounds but was consistently lower than for sugarcane
   burning during the sugarcane harvest season. Determining the major
   sources responsible for ground-level PAHs serves as a tool to improving
   management strategies for PAH emitting sources and a step toward better
   protection of the health of residents in terms of exposure to PAHs. The
   results obtain insight into temporal dominance of PAH polluting sources
   for those residential areas located near sugarcane burning facilities
   and have implications beyond Palm Beach County, in areas with high
   concerns of PAHs and their linked sources.
   Implications: Source apportionment of atmospheric polycyclic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Palm Beach County, Florida, meant to estimate
   contributions of major sources in PAH concentrations measured at Belle
   Glade City of Palm Beach County. Number of benzene rings was found to be
   the key parameter in determining the source with the prevailing
   contribution. Mobile vehicle sources showed a higher contribution for
   species with four or fewer benzene rings, whereas sugarcane burning
   contributed more for species with five or more benzene rings. Results
   from this study encourage more control for sugarcane burns and help to
   better manage authorization of the sugarcane burning incidents and more
   restrictive transportation plans to limit PAH emissions from mobile
   vehicles.}},

Journal = {{OPTOMETRY AND VISION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{395-403}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   Extended release of photo-unstable drugs from ophthalmic inserts is not
   useful unless the loaded drug is protected from degradation. Because of
   the recent interest in extended drug delivery from contact lenses, it is
   critical to assess whether photo-unstable drugs can be stabilized by
   loading in lenses. Here, we focus on dexamethasone, which is prone to
   degradation and has been explored as a candidate for extended release
   from contact lenses for periods ranging from 10 hours to several days.
   Methods
   Degradation rates of dexamethasone were measured in phosphate-buffered
   saline and after loading in contact lenses. The degradation rates were
   measured in a humidified, constant-temperature (32 degrees C) chamber
   with controlled UV exposure. Contact lenses with various degrees of UV
   blocking were used to explore the relationship between degradation rates
   and UV exposure. It is known that vitamin E absorbs UV radiation; thus,
   it was loaded into the lenses to explore the feasibility of reducing the
   degradation rates.
   Results
   About 85\% of dexamethasone degraded in 20 hours in non-UV blocking
   lenses, whereas less than 1\% degraded in class 1 UV blocking lenses.
   Incorporation of vitamin E into the non-UV blocking lenses reduced the
   fractional degradation to 30\%. Degradation rates in phosphate-buffered
   saline were significantly higher than even in non-UV blocking contact
   lenses.
   Conclusions
   The degradation of dexamethasone can be minimized by using a UV blocking
   contact lens or incorporating vitamin E into a non-UV blocking lens.
   Vitamin E incorporation has the dual benefits of improving drug
   stability and release profiles.}},

   arthroplasty?}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{Background: Although many advantages of reverse total shoulder
   arthroplasty (RTSA) have been demonstrated, a variety of complications
   indicate there is much to learn about how RTSA modifies normal shoulder
   function. This study used a subject-specific computational model driven
   by in vivo kinematic data to assess how RTSA affects deltoid muscle
   moment arms after surgery.
   Methods: A subject-specific 12 degree-of-freedom musculoskeletal model
   was used to analyze the shoulders of 26 individuals (14 RTSA and 12
   normal). The model was modified from the work of Holzbaur to directly
   input 6 degree-of-freedom humeral and scapular kinematics obtained using
   fluoroscopy.
   Results: The moment arms of the anterior, lateral, and posterior aspects
   of the deltoid were significantly different when RTSA and normal cohorts
   were compared at different abduction angles. Anterior and lateral
   deltoid moment arms were significantly larger in the RTSA group at the
   initial elevation of the arm. The posterior deltoid was significantly
   larger at maximum elevation. There was large intersubject variability
   within the RTSA group.
   Conclusions: Placement of implant components during RTSA can directly
   affect the geometric relationship between the humerus and scapula and
   the muscle moment arms in the RTSA shoulder. RTSA shoulders maintain the
   same anterior and posterior deltoid muscle moment-arm patterns as
   healthy shoulders but show much greater intersubject variation and
   larger moment-arm magnitudes. These observations provide a basis for
   determining optimal implant configuration and surgical placement to
   maximize RTSA function in a patient-specific manner. Published by

Abstract = {{Electrothermal (ET) plasma discharges are capillary discharges that
   ablate liner materials and form partially ionized plasma. ET plasma
   discharges are generated by driving current pulses through a capillary
   source with peak currents on the order of tens of kA and pulse lengths
   on the order of . These plasma discharges can be used to propel pellets
   into magnetic confinement fusion devices for deep fueling of the fusion
   reaction, ELM mitigation, and thermal quench of the fusion plasma. ET
   plasma discharges have been studied using 0D, 1D, and semi-2D fluid
   models. In this work, a fully 2D model of ET plasma discharges is
   presented. The newly developed model and code resolve inter-species
   interaction forces due to elastic collisions. These forces affect the
   plasma flow field in the source and impede the development of plasma
   pressure at the exit of the source. In this work, these affects are
   observed for discharge current pulses peaking at 10 and 20 kA. The
   sensitivity of the model to the inclusion of charge exchange effects is
   observed. The inclusion of charge exchange has little effect on the
   integrated, global results of the simulation. The difference in total
   ablated mass for the simulations caused by the inclusion of charge
   exchange reactions is < 1 \%. Differences in local plasma parameters are
   observed during discharge initialization, but after initialization,
   these differences diminish. The physical reasoning for this is discussed
   and recommendations are made for future modeling efforts.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The leader-follower consensus problem for multi-agent systems over
   directed random graphs is investigated. Motivated by the fact that
   inter-agent communication can be subject to random failure when agents
   perform tasks in a complex environment, a directed random graph is used
   to model the random loss of communication between agents, where the
   connection of the directed edge in the graph is assumed to be
   probabilistic and evolves according to a two-state Markov Model. In the
   leader-follower network, the leaders maintain a constant desired state
   and the followers update their states by communicating with local
   neighbors over the random communication network. Based on convex
   properties and a stochastic version of LaSalle's Invariance Principle,
   almost sure convergence of the followers' states to the convex hull
   spanned by the leaders' states is established for the leader-follower
   random network. A numerical simulation is provided to demonstrate the
   developed result. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Biomechanical and biochemical outcomes of porcine temporomandibular
   joint disc deformation}},
Journal = {{ARCHIVES OF ORAL BIOLOGY}},

Volume = {{64}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The structure-function relationship in the healthy
   temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disc has been well established, however
   the changes in dysfunctional joints has yet to be systematically
   evaluated. Due to the poor understanding of the etiology of
   temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) this study evaluated naturally
   occurring degenerative remodeling in aged female porcine
   temporomandibular joint (TMJ) discs in order to gain insight into the
   progression and effects on possible treatment strategies of TMDs.
   Design: Surface and regional biomechanical and biochemical properties of
   discal tissues were determined in grossly deformed (>= Wilkes Stage 3)
   and morphologically normal (<= Wilkes Stage 2) TMJ discs.
   Results: Compared to normal disc structure the deformed discs lacked a
   smooth biconcave shape and characteristic ECM organization. Reduction in
   tensile biomechanical integrity and increased compressive stiffness and
   cellularity was found in deformed discs. Regionally, the posterior and
   intermediate zones of the disc were most frequently affected along with
   the inferior surface.
   Conclusions: The frequency of degeneration observed on the inferior
   surface of the disc (predominantly posterior), suggests that a
   disruption in the disc-condyle relationship likely contributes to the
   progression of joint dysfunction more than the temporodiscal
   relationship. As such, the inferior joint space may be an important
   consideration in early clinical diagnosis and treatment of TMDs, as it
   is overlooked in techniques performed in the upper joint space,
   including arthroscopy and arthrocentesis. Furthermore, permanent damage
   to the disc mechanical properties would limit the ability to
   successfully reposition deformed discs, highlighting the importance of
   emerging therapies such as tissue engineering. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{148}},
Pages = {{276-291}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The use of biochar has been suggested as a means of remediating
   contaminated soil and water. The practical applications of conventional
   biochar for contaminant immobilization and removal however need further
   improvements. Hence, recent attention has focused on modification of
   biochar with novel structures and surface properties in order to improve
   its remediation efficacy and environmental benefits. Engineered/designer
   biochars are commonly used terms to indicate application-oriented,
   outcome based biochar modification or synthesis. In recent years,
   biochar modifications involving various methods such as, acid treatment,
   base treatment, amination, surfactant modification, impregnation of
   mineral sorbents, steam activation and magnetic modification have been
   widely studied. This review summarizes and evaluates biochar
   modification methods, corresponding mechanisms, and their benefits for
   contaminant management in soil and water. Applicability and performance
   of modification methods depend on the type of contaminants (i.e.,
   inorganic/organic, anionic/cationic, hydrophilic/hydrophobic,
   polar/non-polar), environmental conditions, remediation goals, and land
   use purpose. In general, modification to produce engineered/designer
   biochar is likely to enhance the sorption capacity of biochar and its
   potential applications for environmental remediation. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{Microscale layering of liquid and vapor phases within microstructures
   for a new generation two-phase heat sink}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{368-378}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In this study, a new heat sink architecture is introduced that operates
   at two different phase change heat transfer modes. At low wall superheat
   temperatures, the heat sink operates under the thin film evaporation
   heat transfer mode and then transitions to the boiling heat transfer
   mode when the wall superheat temperature increases. This unique function
   is enabled through constraining the liquid and vapor phases into
   separate domains using a capillary-controlled meniscus formed within a
   hierarchical 3D structure. The structure is designed to form thin liquid
   layers between vertically oriented menisci across which the liquid is
   evaporated into neighboring vapor channels. The entire structure is then
   capped by a hydrophobic vapor-permeable membrane to fully confine the
   liquid layers while allowing vapor to pass through the membrane. At low
   wall superheats, the liquid layers directly evaporate into the vapor
   channels. In this operation mode, the heat flux was linearly increased
   to a maximum of 54 W/cm(2) at approximately 8 degrees C wall superheat
   temperature, corresponding to a heat transfer coefficient of
   approximately 62 kW/m(2) K. The heat transfer coefficient only slightly
   declined with increasing the wall superheat temperature but
   substantially improved as the liquid supply pressure was increased.
   Increasing the superheat temperature beyond 7-9 degrees C resulted in
   transition to the boiling heat transfer mode with a pronounced increase
   in surface temperature fluctuations. This transition to boiling results
   in a decline in the heat transfer coefficient because the meniscus
   formed between the liquid and vapor spaces breaks down. However, the
   heat removal capacity is significantly increased, and a critical heat
   flux of about 300 W/cm(2) is reached at <30 degrees C wall superheat
   temperature, corresponding to a heat transfer coefficient of
   approximately 100 kW/m(2) K. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Both experimental measurements and assessment of phase equilibria are
   reported in the Cu-Ga-In material system, which is an important
   constituent in growth of the thin film photovoltaic absorber
   Cu(In,Ga)Se-2 (CIGS). Characterization of four different alloys using
   inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, X-ray
   diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive
   spectroscopy, differential thermal analysis, and differential scanning
   calorimetry has been conducted, and high-temperature equilibration
   studies have been performed on 2 of those. The new data are
   qualitatively consistent with the previous nonequilibrium thin film
   Cu-Ga-In observations. A thermodynamic assessment of the ternary system
   has also been performed using a CALPHAD approach after re-assessing the
   Cu-In constituent. The model fits the ternary data well in addition to
   the Cu-Ga, Cu-In, and Ga-In binary data. Practical applications of the
   model to metal precursors in a CIGS selenization process are discussed.
   Using the assessed parameters, the model predicts that at temperatures
   typically used in CIGS processes, Cu-Ga-In films should undergo
   equilibrium phase transformations. Slight changes in composition are
   found to determine whether or not these transitions occur, and at what
   temperature. Equilibrated precursor films are calculated to have high
   gamma-Cu-9(Ga,In)(4) phase content, where reducing equilibration and
   gamma-Cu-9(Ga,In)(4) formation have previously been found to improve
   photovoltaic performance.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium ion capacitors (LICs) are emerging as promising energy storage
   devices; thus, understanding their electrochemistry is of great
   interest. Here we report the study of a novel LIC by employing in situ
   nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) as a nondestructive tool,
   revealing the sequence of electrochemical processes in it. We have
   performed in situ Li-7 NMR experiments on the LIC by simultaneously
   cycling the LIC pouch cell in the voltage range 2.0-4.0 V. NMR spectra
   recorded for multiple cycles reveal the Li-7 NMR signals arising from
   different parts of the capacitor. By employing a combination of in situ
   Li-7 NMR, component isolation, and Gaussian-Lorentzian peak fitting, we
   investigate the resonances arising from the Li metal from stabilized
   lithium metal powder (SLMP), free ions in electrolyte, the solid
   electrolyte interface layer (SEI), intercalated lithium in carbon anode,
   and the Li ions in the electric double layer on cathode. The recorded in
   situ Li-7 NMR spectra showed that the charge and discharge processes
   caused electrochemical reactions, resulting in considerable repetitive
   changes in peak intensities and chemical shifts over multiple cycles.
   Further cycle experiments revealed contributions from individual
   electrodes. This series of experiments aid in the visualization of the
   Li ion transfer mechanisms in LICs.}},

Journal = {{LANGMUIR}},

Abstract = {{Laser-induced forward transfer-based laser printing has been being
   implemented as a promising orifice free direct-write strategy for
   different printing applications. The printing quality during laser
   printing is largely affected by the jet and droplet formation process
   and subsequential impingement. The objective of this study is to
   investigate the impingement-based printing type and resulting printing
   quality during the laser printing of viscoelastic alginate solutions,
   which are representative inks for soft structure printing such as
   bioprinting. Three printing types are identified: droplet impingement
   printing, jet-impingement printing with multiple breakups, and
   jet-impingement printing with a single breakup. Printing quality, in
   terms of printed droplet morphology and size, has been investigated as a
   function of alginate concentration, laser fluence, and direct-writing
   height based on a time-resolved imaging approach and microarrays of
   printed droplets. Of these, the best printing quality is achieved with
   single-breakup jet-impingement printing, followed by multiple breakup
   jet-impingement printing, with droplet-impingement printing producing
   the lowest quality printing. The printing quality can be improved by
   using high-concentration alginate solutions. The increase of laser
   fluence may lead to a well-defined primary droplet for low-concentration
   alginate solutions; however, this can cause the droplet diameter to
   increase, which may not be desirable. The direct-writing height (i.e.,
   ribbon coating-receiving substrate distance) also influences the print
   quality. For example, an increase in direct-writing height can cause the
   printing type to change from the ideal jet-impingement with a single
   breakup, to the jet-impingement with multiple breakups, and even the
   least desired droplet-impingement printing, with only slight variations
   in droplet diameter.}},

Abstract = {{Glaucoma is commonly treated using eye drops, which is highly
   inefficient due to rapid clearance (low residence time) from ocular
   surface. Contact lenses are ideally suited for controlled drug delivery
   to cornea, but incorporation of any drug loaded particulate system
   (formulation) affect the optical and physical property of contact
   lenses. The objective of the present work was to implant timolol maleate
   (TM) loaded ethyl cellulose nanoparticle-laden ring in hydrogel contact
   lenses that could provide controlled drug delivery at therapeutic rates
   without compromising critical lens properties. TM-implant lenses were
   developed, by dispersing TM encapsulated ethyl cellulose nanoparticles
   in acrylate hydrogel (fabricated as ring implant) and implanted the same
   in hydrogel contact lenses (sandwich system). The TM-ethyl cellulose
   nanoparticles were prepared by double emulsion method at different
   ratios of TM to ethyl cellulose. The X-ray diffraction studies revealed
   the transformation of TM to amorphous state. In vitro release kinetic
   data showed sustained drug release within the therapeutic window for 168
   h (NP 1:3 batch) with 150 mu g loading. Cytotoxicity and ocular
   irritation study demonstrated the safety of TM-implant contact lenses.
   In vivo pharmacokinetic studies in rabbit tear fluid showed significant
   increase in mean residence time (MRT) and area under curve (AUC), with
   TM-implant contact lenses in comparison to eye drop therapy. In vivo
   pharmacodynamic data in rabbit model showed sustained reduction in intra
   ocular pressure for 192 h. The study demonstrated the promising
   potential of implantation technology to treat glaucoma using contact
   lenses, and could serve as a platform for other ocular diseases. (C)

Abstract = {{Ten upward propagating return stroke currents in eight triggered
   lightning flashes have been observed to reflect downward from 140 to
   300m altitude by way of measurements of the channel base current, close
   electric field and electric field derivative, and high-speed video. The
   current reflections appear as dips in the measured channel base current
   and in the electric fields and as bipolar pulses in the electric field
   derivative waveforms. The current dips occur 2.7 to 13.9s after the
   initiation of the return stroke current at ground. The observed
   phenomenon results from a portion of the upward propagating return
   stroke current wave being reflected from a channel impedance
   discontinuity apparently associated with an isolated section of
   unexploded triggering wire, as inferred from high-speed video records. A
   transmission line model is used to model the close electric field and
   electric field derivative of the postulated initial and reflected
   current waves, starting with the measured channel base current, and the
   results are compared favorably with measurements made at 92 to 326m.
   From the measured time between the return stroke current initiation at
   the ground and the time the current reflection reaches the channel base
   and produces the current dip, along with the reflection height inferred
   from the video records, we find the average of the upward and downward
   reflected return stroke current speed for each of the 10 strokes to be
   between 0.81 and 2.06 x 10(8)ms(-1).}},

Abstract = {{Despite recent progress for efficient and precise synthesis of
   functional polymers, few reports describe postpolymerization
   functionalization strategies for the controlled incorporation of
   Multiple,pendent groups per repeat unit. Cyanuric chloride, or
   2,4,6-trichloro-1,3,5-triazine (TCT), offers a facile method to
   introduce distinct pendent functionalities. An acrylamide monomer
   containing a triazine ring with two electrophilic sites was prepared
   from TCT and polymerized via reversible addition fragmentation chain
   transfer (RAFT) polymerization. Subsequent nucleophilic aromatic
   substitution reactions using a combination of amine and thiol
   nucleophiles introduced two functionalities into each repeat unit of the
   RAFT-derived polymers. The success of each postpolymerization
   modification reaction was confirmed by H-1 NMR spectroscopy and
   size-exclusion chromatography, and small molecule model studies
   corroborated the high chemoselectivity of the nucleophilic aromatic
   substitution reactions. This postpolymerization modification strategy
   based on TCT enables a facile and efficient synthesis of multifunctional
   homopolymers.}},

Title = {{A risk index for pediatric patients undergoing diagnostic imaging with
   Tc-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid that accounts for body habitus}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY}},

Month = {{MAR 21}},
Abstract = {{Published guidelines for administered activity to pediatric patients
   undergoing diagnostic nuclear medicine imaging are currently obtained
   through expert consensus of the minimum values as a function of body
   weight as required to yield diagnostic quality images. We have
   previously shown that consideration of body habitus is also important in
   obtaining diagnostic quality images at the lowest administered activity.
   The objective of this study was to create a series of computational
   phantoms that realistically portray the anatomy of the pediatric patient
   population which can be used to develop and validate techniques to
   minimize radiation dose while maintaining adequate image quality. To
   achieve this objective, we have defined an imaging risk index that may
   be used in future studies to develop pediatric patient dosing
   guidelines. A population of 48 hybrid phantoms consisting of non-uniform
   B-spline surfaces and polygon meshes was generated. The representative
   ages included the newborn, 1 year, 5 year, 10 year and 15 year male and
   female. For each age, the phantoms were modeled at their 10th, 50th, and
   90th height percentile each at a constant 50th weight percentile. To
   test the impact of kidney size, the newborn phantoms were modeled with
   the following three kidney volumes: -15\%, average, and +15\%. To
   illustrate the impact of different morphologies on dose optimization, we
   calculated the effective dose for each phantom using weight-based
   Tc-99m-DMSA activity administration. For a given patient weight, body
   habitus had a considerable effect on effective dose. Substantial
   variations were observed in the risk index between the 10th and 90th
   percentile height phantoms from the 50th percentile phantoms for a given
   age, with the greatest difference being 18\%. There was a dependence
   found between kidney size and risk of radiation induced kidney cancer,
   with the highest risk indices observed in newborns with the smallest
   kidneys. Overall, the phantoms and techniques in this study can be used
   to provide data to refine dosing guidelines for pediatric nuclear
   imaging studies while taking into account the effects on both radiation
   dose and image quality.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater high in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was spiked with
   0-120mol/L of copper(II) (Cu) at pH 4, 6, and 8 to observe changes in
   fluorescence and UV absorbance of natural organic matter (NOM). The
   groundwater had a fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM)
   characteristic of humic-like substances. Addition of Cu to the
   groundwater resulted in fluorescence quenching of EEM peak intensity and
   increase in UV absorbance at 254nm (UVA(254)). Both fluorescence
   quenching and increase in UVA(254) suggested the complex formation
   between Cu and NOM. Importantly, DOC measurements showed that physical
   loss of NOM did not play a measureable role in contributing to the
   observed fluorescence quenching and increase in UVA(254), which supports
   the complex formation of Cu-NOM. The conditional stability constant for
   Cu-NOM was estimated using both fluorescence quenching and UVA(254)
   increase at each pH and ranged from 4.26 to 5.77. As a follow up, anion
   exchange and cation exchange batch experiments were conducted using the
   groundwater spiked with 120mol/L Cu at pH 8 to gain insight on the
   behavior of Cu-NOM, and attempt to give physical meaning to the
   fluorescence quenching and UVA(254) increase. The ion exchange results
   suggested the possibility of a neutral or partially negatively charged
   Cu-NOM complex. The significance of this work resides in the idea that
   fluorescence quenching and UV absorbance of NOM can be used as a tool to
   evaluate the co-removal of contaminants through water treatment
   processes.}},

Title = {{Behavior of molecules and molecular ions near a field emitter}},
Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{MAR 18}},
Abstract = {{The cold emission of particles from surfaces under intense electric
   fields is a process which underpins a variety of applications including
   atom probe tomography (APT), an analytical microscopy technique with
   near-atomic spatial resolution. Increasingly relying on fast laser
   pulsing to trigger the emission, APT experiments often incorporate the
   detection of molecular ions emitted from the specimen, in particular
   from covalently or ionically bonded materials. Notably, it has been
   proposed that neutral molecules can also be emitted during this process.
   However, this remains a contentious issue. To investigate the validity
   of this hypothesis, a careful review of the literature is combined with
   the development of new methods to treat experimental APT data, the
   modeling of ion trajectories, and the application of density-functional
   theory simulations to derive molecular ion energetics. It is shown that
   the direct thermal emission of neutral molecules is extremely unlikely.
   However, neutrals can still be formed in the course of an APT experiment
   by dissociation of metastable molecular ions.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Absorbed dose estimates for pediatric patients require
   pharmacokinetics that are, to the extent possible, age-specific. Such
   age-specific pharmacokinetic data are lacking for many of the diagnostic
   agents typically used in pediatric imaging. We have developed a
   pharmacokinetic model of {[}F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) applicable to
   premature infants and to 0-(newborns) to 5-year-old patients, which may
   be used to generate model-derived time-integrated activity coefficients
   and absorbed dose calculations for these patients.
   Methods: The FDG compartmental model developed by Hays and Segall for
   adults was fitted to published data from infants and also to a
   retrospective data set collected at the Boston Children's Hospital
   (BCH). The BCH data set was also used to examine the relationship
   between uptake of FDG in different organs and patient weight or age.
   Results: Substantial changes in the structure of the FDG model were
   required to fit the pediatric data. Fitted rate constants and fractional
   blood volumes were reduced relative to the adult values.
   Conclusions: The pharmacokinetic models developed differ substantially
   from adult pharmacokinetic (PK) models which can have considerable
   impact on the dosimetric models for pediatric patients. This approach
   may be used as a model for estimating dosimetry in children from other
   radiopharmaceuticals.}},

Volume = {{283}},

Abstract = {{The diversity and structure of ecosystems has been found to depend both
   on trophic interactions in food webs and on other species interactions
   such as habitat modification and mutualism that form non-trophic
   interaction networks. However, quantification of the dependencies
   between these two main interaction networks has remained elusive. In
   this study, we assessed how habitat-modifying organisms affect basic
   food web properties by conducting in-depth empirical investigations of
   two ecosystems: North American temperate fringing marshes and West
   African tropical seagrass meadows. Results reveal that habitat-modifying
   species, through non-trophic facilitation rather than their trophic
   role, enhance species richness across multiple trophic levels, increase
   the number of interactions per species (link density), but decrease the
   realized fraction of all possible links within the food web
   (connectance). Compared to the trophic role of the most highly connected
   species, we found this non-trophic effects to be more important for
   species richness and of more or similar importance for link density and
   connectance. Our findings demonstrate that food webs can be
   fundamentally shaped by interactions outside the trophic network, yet
   intrinsic to the species participating in it. Better integration of
   non-trophic interactions in food web analyses may therefore strongly
   contribute to their explanatory and predictive capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Each stroke in a negative cloud-to-ground lightning flash is composed of
   downward leader and upward return stroke processes, which are usually
   modeled individually. The first stroke leader is stepped and starts with
   preliminary breakdown (PB) which is often viewed as a separate process.
   We present the first unified engineering model for computing the
   electric field produced by a sequence of PB, stepped leader, and return
   stroke processes, serving to transport negative charge to ground. We
   assume that a negatively charged channel extends downward in a stepped
   fashion during both the PB and leader stages. Each step involves a
   current wave that propagates upward along the newly formed channel
   section. Once the leader attaches to ground, an upward propagating
   return stroke neutralizes the charge deposited along the channel.
   Model-predicted electric fields are in reasonably good agreement with
   simultaneous measurements at both near (hundreds of meters,
   electrostatic field component is dominant) and far (tens of kilometers,
   radiation field component is dominant) distances from the lightning
   channel. Relations between the features of computed electric field
   waveforms and model input parameters are examined. It appears that peak
   currents associated with PB pulses are similar to return stroke peak
   currents, and the observed variation of electric radiation field peaks
   produced by leader steps at different heights above ground is influenced
   by the ground corona space charge.}},

Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{The partial least squares (PLS) method is designed for prediction
   problems when the number of predictors is larger than the number of
   training samples. PLS is based on latent components which are linear
   combinations of the original predictors, it automatically employs all
   predictors regardless of their relevance. This strategy will potentially
   degrade its performance, and make the obtained coefficients lack
   interpretability. Then, several sparse PLS (SPLS) methods are proposed
   to simultaneously conduct prediction and variable selection via sparsely
   combining original predictors. However, if information bleed across
   different components, common variables shared by these components should
   be selected with successive loadings. To address this issue, we propose
   a new SPLS model mixed-norm PLS (MNPLS) to select common variables
   during each deflation in this paper. More specifically, we introduced
   the l(2,1) norm to the direction matrix and then developed the
   corresponding solution to MNPLS. Moreover, we also conducted convergence
   analysis to mathematically support the proposed MNPLS. Experiments are
   conducted on four real datasets, experimental results verified our
   theoretical analysis, and also demonstrated that our MNPLS method can
   generally outperform the standard PLS and other existing methods in
   variable selection and prediction. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{MAR 14}},
Abstract = {{A multi-port electrostatically driven silicon acoustic cavity is
   implemented that efficiently traps the energy of a temperature-stable
   eigen-mode with Lame cross-sectional polarization. Dispersive behavior
   of propagating and evanescent guided waves in a < 100 >-aligned single
   crystal silicon waveguide is used to engineer the acoustic energy
   distribution of a specific shear eigen-mode that is well known for its
   low temperature sensitivity when implemented in doped single crystal
   silicon. Such an acoustic energy trapping in the central region of the
   acoustic cavity geometry and far from substrate obviates the need for
   narrow tethers that are conventionally used for non-destructive and high
   quality factor (Q) energy suspension in MEMS resonators; therefore, the
   acoustically engineered waveguide can simultaneously serve as in-situ
   self-oven by passing large uniformly distributed DC currents through its
   body and without any concern about perturbing the mode shape or
   deforming narrow supports. Such a stable thermo-structural performance
   besides large turnover temperatures than can be realized in Lame
   eigen-modes make this device suitable for implementation of ultra-stable
   oven-controlled oscillators. 78 MHz prototypes implemented in
   arsenic-doped single crystal silicon substrates with different
   resistivity are transduced by in-and out-of-plane narrow-gap capacitive
   ports, showing high Q of similar to 43k. The low resistivity device
   shows an overall temperature-induced frequency drift of 200 ppm over the
   range of -20 degrees C to 80 degrees C, which is similar to 15x smaller
   compared to overall frequency drift measured for the similar yet high
   resistivity device in the same temperature range. Furthermore, a
   frequency tuning of similar to 2100 ppm is achieved in high resistivity
   device by passing 45 mA DC current through its body. Continuous
   operation of the device under such a self-ovenizing current over 10 days
   did not induce frequency instability or degradation in Q. (C) 2016 AIP

Title = {{Transient Pinning and Pulling: A Mechanism for Bending Microtubules}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 14}},
Abstract = {{Microtubules have a persistence length of the order of millimeters in
   vitro, but inside cells they bend over length scales of microns. It has
   been proposed that polymerization forces bend microtubules in the
   vicinity of the cell boundary or other obstacles, yet bends develop even
   when microtubules are polymerizing freely, unaffected by obstacles and
   cell boundaries. How these bends are formed remains unclear. By tracking
   the motions of microtubules marked by photobleaching, we found that in
   LLC-PK1 epithelial cells local bends develop primarily by plus-end
   directed transport of portions of the microtubule contour towards
   stationary locations (termed pinning points) along the length of the
   microtubule. The pinning points were transient in nature, and their
   eventual release allowed the bends to relax. The directionality of the
   transport as well as the overall incidence of local bends decreased when
   dynein was inhibited, while myosin inhibition had no observable effect.
   This suggests that dynein generates a tangential force that bends
   microtubules against stationary pinning points. Simulations of
   microtubule motion and polymerization accounting for filament mechanics
   and dynein forces predict the development of bends of size and shape
   similar to those observed in cells. Furthermore, simulations show that
   dynein-generated bends at a pinning point near the plus end can cause a
   persistent rotation of the tip consistent with the observation that bend
   formation near the tip can change the direction of microtubule growth.
   Collectively, these results suggest a simple physical mechanism for the
   bending of growing microtubules by dynein forces accumulating at pinning
   points.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by applications in manufacturing industry, we consider a
   supply chain scheduling problem, where each job is characterised by
   non-identical sizes, different release times and unequal processing
   times. The objective is to minimise the makespan by making batching and
   sequencing decisions. The problem is formalised as a mixed integer
   programming model and proved to be strongly NP-hard. Some structural
   properties are presented for both the general case and a special case.
   Based on these properties, a lower bound is derived, and a novel
   two-phase heuristic (TP-H) is developed to solve the problem, which
   guarantees to obtain a worst case performance ratio of
   {[}GRAPHICS]
   . Computational experiments with a set of different sizes of random
   instances are conducted to evaluate the proposed approach TP-H, which is
   superior to another two heuristics proposed in the literature.
   Furthermore, the experimental results indicate that TP-H can effectively
   and efficiently solve large-size problems in a reasonable time.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{MAR 7}},
Abstract = {{Studies of implant activation in InAs have not been reported presumably
   because of challenges associated with junction leakage. The activation
   of 20 keV, Si+ implants into lightly doped (001) p-type bulk InAs
   performed at 100 degrees C as a function of annealing time and
   temperature was measured via Raman scattering. Peak shift of the L+
   coupled phonon-plasmon mode after annealing at 700 degrees C shows that
   active n-type doping levels approximate to 5 x 10(19) cm(-3) are
   possible for ion implanted Si in InAs. These values are comparable to
   the highest reported active carrier concentrations of 8-12 x 10(19)
   cm(-3) for growth-doped n-InAs. Raman scattering is shown to be a
   viable, non-contact technique to measure active carrier concentration in
   instances where contact-based methods such as Hall effect produce
   erroneous measurements or junction leakage prevents the measurement of
   shallow n(+) layers, which cannot be effectively isolated from the bulk.

Abstract = {{60-GHz millimetre-wave (mm-wave) communication is gradually becoming a
   promising candidate for the next generation wireless system to meet the
   demands of mobile applications. To compensate for high path loss,
   directional links are established in mm-wave communication system, which
   adds opportunity for spatial reuse. As one of its most promising
   protocols for commercial production, IEEE 802.11ad standard provides a
   mechanism to support space-time division multiple access (STDMA) within
   a single network. However, the interference level among different
   co-channel networks is much lower than that inside a network, which
   provides greater potential for spatial reuse. In this study, based on
   the architecture and timing structure of IEEE 802.11ad, the authors
   propose a spatial reuse strategy among multiple co-channel networks.
   They formulate the problem as a mixed-integer non-linear programming
   problem, and then propose an inter-network STDMA scheduling algorithm,
   which considers clustering frame structure in IEEE 802.11ad, and
   combines greedy principle and mutual interference avoidance strategy.
   Extensive simulation results have shown that the proposed scheme
   enlarges total throughput in comparison with STDMA inside each network,
   as well as non-STDMA scheme. Meanwhile, it achieves the lowest packet
   loss rate under heavy traffic load.}},

Abstract = {{Symptoms of bacterial and fungal keratitis are typically treated through
   the frequent application of antibiotic and antifungal eye drops. The
   high frequency of half hourly or hourly eye drop administration required
   to treat these indications is tedious and could reduce compliance. Here,
   we combine in vitro experiments with a mathematical model to develop
   therapeutic soft contact lenses to cure keratitis by extended release of
   suitable drugs. We specifically focus on increasing the release duration
   of levofloxacin and chlorhexidine from 1-DAY ACUVUE (R) TrueEye(TM) and
   ACUVUE OASYS contact lenses by incorporating vitamin E diffusion
   barriers. Results show that 20\% of vitamin E loading in the contact
   lens increases the release duration of levofloxacin to 100 h and 50 h
   from 1-DAY ACUVUE (R) TrueEye(TM) and ACUVUE OASYS (R), respectively,
   which is a 3- and 6-fold increase, respectively, for the 2 lenses. For
   chlorhexidine, the increase is 2.5- and 10-fold, for the TrueEye(TM) and
   OASYS (R), respectively, to 130 h and 170 h. The mass of drug loaded in
   the lenses can be controlled to achieve a daily release comparable to
   the commonly prescribed eye drop therapy. The vitamin E-loaded lenses
   retain all critical properties for in vivo use. (C) 2016 American

Abstract = {{Since the meniscus has limited capacity to self-repair, creating a
   long-lasting meniscus replacement may help reduce the incidence of
   osteoarthritis (OA) after meniscus damage. As a first step toward this
   goal, this study evaluated the mechanical integrity of a decellularized,
   laser drilled (LD) meniscus as a potential scaffold for meniscal
   engineering. To evaluate the decellularization process, 24 porcine
   menisci were processed such that one half remained native tissue, while
   the other half was decellularized in sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). To
   evaluate the laser drilling process, 24 additional menisci were
   decellularized, with one half remaining intact while the other half was
   LD. Decellularization did not affect the tensile properties, but had
   significant effects on the cyclic compressive hysteresis and unconfined
   compressive stress relaxation. Laser drilling decreased the Young's
   modulus and instantaneous stress during unconfined stress relaxation and
   the circumferential ultimate strength during tensile testing. However,
   the losses in mechanical integrity in the LD menisci were generally
   smaller than the variance observed between samples, and thus, the
   material properties for the LD tissue remained within a physiological
   range. In the future, optimization of laser drilling patterns may
   improve these material properties. Moreover, reseeding the construct
   with cells may further improve the mechanical properties prior to
   implantation. As such, this work serves as a proof of concept for
   generating decellularized, LD menisci scaffolds for the purposes of
   meniscal engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Previous investigations on acute postoperative pain dynamicity have
   focused on daily pain assessments, and so were unable to examine
   intraday variations in acute pain intensity. We analyzed 476,108
   postoperative acute pain intensity ratings, which were clinically
   documented on postoperative days 1 to 7 from 8346 surgical patients
   using Markov chain modeling to describe how patients are likely to
   transition from one pain state to another in a probabilistic fashion.
   The Markov chain was found to be irreducible and positive recurrent,
   with no absorbing states. Transition probabilities ranged from 0.0031,
   for the transition from state 10 to state 1, to 0.69 for the transition
   from state 0 to state 0. The greatest density of transitions was noted
   in the diagonal region of the transition matrix, suggesting that
   patients were generally most likely to transition to the same pain state
   as their current state. There were also slightly increased probability
   densities in transitioning to a state of asleep or 0 from the current
   state. An examination of the number of steps required to traverse from a
   particular first pain score to a target state suggested that overall,
   fewer steps were required to reach a state of 0 (range 6.1-8.8 steps) or
   asleep (range 9.1-11) than were required to reach a mild pain intensity
   state. Our results suggest that using Markov chains is a feasible method
   for describing probabilistic postoperative pain trajectories, pointing
   toward the possibility of using Markov decision processes to model
   sequential interactions between pain intensity ratings, and
   postoperative analgesic interventions.}},

Abstract = {{This article introduces the minimum spanning k-core problem that seeks
   to find a spanning subgraph with a minimum degree of at least k (also
   known as a k-core) that minimizes the total cost of the edges in the
   subgraph. The concept of k-cores was introduced in social network
   analysis to identify denser portions of a social network. We exploit the
   graph-theoretic properties of this model to introduce a new approach to
   survivable interhub network design via spanning k-cores; the model
   preserves connectivity and diameter under limited edge failures. The
   deterministic version of the problem is polynomial-time solvable due to
   its equivalence to generalized graph matching. We propose two
   conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) constrained optimization models to
   obtain risk-averse solutions for the minimum spanning k-core problem
   under probabilistic edge failures. We present polyhedral reformulations
   of the convex piecewise linear loss functions used in these models that
   enable Benders-like decomposition approaches. A decomposition and
   branch-and-cut approach is then developed to solve the scenario-based
   approximation of the CVaR-constrained minimum spanning k-core problem
   for the aforementioned loss functions. The computational performance of
   the algorithm is investigated via numerical experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Biofouling, or accumulation of unwanted biofilms, on surfaces is a major
   concern for public health and human industry. Materials either avoiding
   contamination (fouling resistant) and/or directly killing attached
   microbes (biocidal) have thus far failed to achieve the goal of
   eliminating biofouling; fouling resistant surfaces eventually foul and
   biocidal surfaces accumulate debris that eventually decrease their
   efficacy. Combined biocidal and fouling release materials offer the
   potential for both killing and removing debris and are promising
   candidates for reducing biofouling on manufactured materials.
   Interference lithography was used to create nanopatterns of initiators,
   which were then used to initiate atom transfer radical polymerization of
   the temperature-responsive polymer, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)
   (PNIPAAm) as a fouling release component. Biocidal activity was
   conferred by subsequent layer-by-layer deposition of cationic and
   anionic poly(phenylene ethynylenes) into the valleys between the
   PNIPAAm. For both Gram positive and Gram negative model bacteria,
   dark-regime biocidal activity was observed that did not increase upon
   exposure to light, suggesting that the mode of antimicrobial activity is
   due to ionic disruption of the cell wall. Subsequent to killing,
   bacteria and cellular debris were removed upon a temperature-induced
   phase transition of the PNIPAAm. These materials exhibited capture,
   killing, and release activity over multiple cycles of use. (C) 2016

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{20}},

Pages = {{65-92}},

Abstract = {{As the number of cores in chip multi-processor systems increases, the
   contention over shared last-level cache (LLC) resources increases, thus
   making LLC optimization critical, especially for embedded systems with
   strict area/energy/power constraints. We propose cache partitioning with
   partial sharing (CaPPS), which reduces LLC contention using cache
   partitioning and improves utilization with sharing configuration.
   Sharing configuration enables the partitions to be privately allocated
   to a single core, partially shared with a subset of cores, or fully
   shared with all cores based on the co-executing applications'
   requirements. CaPPS imposes low hardware overhead and affords an
   extensive design space to increase optimization potential. To facilitate
   fast design space exploration, we develop an analytical model to quickly
   estimate the miss rates of all CaPPS configurations using the
   applications' isolated LLC access traces to predict runtime LLC
   contention. Experimental results demonstrate that the analytical model
   estimates cache miss rates with an average error of only 0.73\% and with
   an average speedup of 3505x as compared to a cycle-accurate simulator.
   Due to CaPPS's extensive design space, CaPPS can reduce the average LLC
   miss rate by as much as 25\% as compared to baseline configurations and
   as much as 14-17 \% as compared to prior works.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a computer-numerical-controlled ultraviolet light
   -emitting diode (CNC UV-LED) lithography scheme for three-dimensional
   (3D) microfabrication. The CNC lithography scheme utilizes sequential
   multi-angled UV light exposures along with a synchronized switchable UV
   light source to create arbitrary 3D light traces, which are transferred
   into the photosensitive resist. The system comprises a switchable,
   movable UV-LED array as a light source, a motorized tilt-rotational
   sample holder, and a computer control unit. System operation is such
   that the tilt-rotational sample holder moves in apre-programmed routine,
   and the UV-LED is illuminated only at desired positions of the sample
   holder during the desired time period, enabling the formation of complex
   3D microstructures. This facilitates easy fabrication of complex 31)
   structures, which otherwise would have required multiple manual exposure
   steps as in the previous multidirectional 3D UV lithography approach.
   Since it is batch processed, processing time is far less than that of
   the 3D printing approach at the expense of some reduction in the degree
   of achievable 3D structure complexity. In order to produce uniform light
   intensity from the arrayed LED light source, the UV-LED array stage has
   been kept rotating during exposure. UV-LED 3D fabrication capability was
   demonstrated through a plurality of complex structures such as V-shaped
   micropillars, micropanels, a micro -'hi' structure, a micro -`cat's
   claw,' a micro `horn,' a micro -'calla lily,' a micro -`cowboy's hat,'

Abstract = {{The problem of determining high-accuracy minimum-time Earth-orbit
   transfers using low-thrust propulsion with eclipsing is considered. The
   orbit transfer problem is posed as a multiple-phase optimal control
   problem where the spacecraft can thrust only during phases where it has
   line of sight to the sun. Event constraints, based on the geometry of a
   penumbra shadow region, are enforced between the phases and determine
   the amount of time spent in an eclipse. An initial guess generation
   method is developed that constructs a useful guess by solving a series
   of single-phase optimal control problems and analyzing the resulting
   trajectory to approximate where the spacecraft enters and exits the
   Earth's shadow. The single-phase and multiple-phase optimal control
   problems are solved using an hp adaptive Legendre-Gauss-Radau orthogonal
   collocation method. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach
   developed in this research, optimal transfer trajectories are computed
   for two Earth-orbit transfers found in the literature. In addition to
   the two comparison cases studied, a separate Earth-orbit transfer is
   examined, and solutions are presented for four different departures
   dates.}},

   fuel surrogate (acetone-seeded nitrogen) injected directly into the
   recirculation region of a cavity flameholder embedded in a nonreacting
   supersonic airflow. The effect of injection configuration and fueling
   rate were studied. Parallel injection from the cavity front wall
   resulted in an ultra-fuel-rich recirculation region (beyond the upper
   flammability limit of an ethylene-air mixture) with a mixing efficiency
   that degraded with increased fueling rate. Downstream angled injection
   from the cavity floor yielded a substantial improvement in terms of the
   spatial uniformity and flammability of the local mixture. Its mixing
   efficiency was observed to be independent of fueling rate. The superior
   mixing ability of the latter injection configuration has the potential
   to provide increased cavity flameholder operability through a broader
   range of ignition and blowout limits and more flexibility in terms of
   ignitor placement than conventional direct-fueling schemes. Further
   investigation of its performance over a wider range of reacting
   conditions is warranted.}},

Title = {{Inter-phase heat transfer and energy coupling in turbulent dispersed
   multiphase flows}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The present paper addresses important fundamental issues of inter-phase
   heat transfer and energy coupling in turbulent dispersed multiphase
   flows through scaling analysis. In typical point-particle or two-fluid
   approaches, the fluid motion and convective heat transfer at the
   particle scale are not resolved and the momentum and energy coupling
   between fluid and particles are provided by proper closure models. By
   examining the kinetic energy transfer due to the coupling forces from
   the macroscale to microscale fluid motion, closure models are obtained
   for the contributions of the coupling forces to the energy coupling. Due
   to the inviscid origin of the added-mass force, its contribution to the
   microscale kinetic energy does not contribute to dissipative transfer to
   fluid internal energy as was done by the quasi-steady force. Time scale
   analysis shows that when the particle is larger than a critical
   diameter, the diffusive-unsteady kernel decays at a time scale that is
   smaller than the Kolmogorov time scale. As a result, the computationally
   costly Basset-like integral form of diffusive-unsteady heat transfer can
   be simplified to a non-integral form. Conventionally, the
   fluid-to-particle volumetric heat capacity ratio is used to evaluate the
   relative importance of the unsteady heat transfer to the energy balance
   of the particles. Therefore, for gas-particle flows, where the
   fluid-to-particle volumetric heat capacity ratio is small, unsteady heat
   transfer is usually ignored. However, the present scaling analysis shows
   that for small fluid-to-particle volumetric heat capacity ratio, the
   importance of the unsteady heat transfer actually depends on the ratio
   between the particle size and the Kolmogorov scale. Furthermore, the
   particle mass loading multiplied by the heat capacity ratio is usually
   used to estimate the importance of the thermal two-way coupling effect.
   Through scaling argument, improved estimates are established for the
   energy coupling parameters of each energy exchange mechanism between the
   phases. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{With an increasing deployment of plug-in electric vehicles, evaluating
   and mitigating the impacts of additional electrical loads created by
   these vehicles on power distribution grids become more important. This
   paper explores the use of prices of electricity at public charging

   both power distribution and urban transportation networks. More
   specifically, a multi-class combined distribution and assignment model
   is formulated to capture the spatial distribution of plug-in electric
   vehicles across the transportation network and estimate the electrical
   loads they impose on the power distribution network. Power flow
   equations are subsequently solved to estimate real power losses. Prices
   of electricity at public charging stations and road tolls are then
   optimized to minimize both real power losses in the distribution grid
   and total travel time in the urban transportation network. The pricing
   model is formulated as a mathematical program with complementarity
   constraints and solved by a manifold suboptimization algorithm and a
   pattern search method. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate
   the proposed model and solution algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{To better understand the mechanisms of allelopathy of Artemisia ordosica
   Spreng., we tested the hypothesis that allelochemicals from A. ordosica
   changes to K+ and NH4+ absorption in roots, thereby regulating the seed
   germination and seedling growth of associated plants {[}Agriophyllum
   squarrosum (L.) Moq., Corispermum hyssopifolium L., Astragalus melitodes
   Pall. and Setaria viridis (L.) Beauv.]. We found that allelochemicals
   (benzoic acid, butanedioic acid and hexadecanoic acid) from A. ordosica,
   were released into the surrounding soil and inhibited the seed
   gemination, root growth, shoot height and also decreased the dry mass of
   these associated plants. Conversely, A. ordosica extracts promoted the
   seed gemination and seedling growth of Setaria viridis grass. For the
   first time, we showed that the mechanism was related to ion adsorption
   by using non-invasive ion selective microsensors. These microsensor
   studies showed that the extracts of A. ordosica significantly decreased
   the root absorbtion of K+ and NH4+ for A. squarrosum, C. hyssopifolium
   and A. melitodes, but enhanced the root uptake of K+ and NH4+ in S.
   viridis. These results are imperative to understand the underlying
   mechanism of allelopathy between plants, which significantly impacts the
   dryland vegetation, wind shelters, water runoff and other ecosystem
   dynamics.}},

Title = {{Can a total knee arthroplasty be both rotationally unconstrained and
   anteroposteriorly stabilised?}},
Journal = {{BONE \& JOINT RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{80-86}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Objectives
   Throughout the 20th Century, it has been postulated that the knee moves
   on the basis of a four-bar link mechanism composed of the cruciate
   ligaments, the femur and the tibia. As a consequence, the femur has been
   thought to roll back with flexion, and total knee arthroplasty (TKA)
   prostheses have been designed on this basis. Recent work, however, has
   proposed that at a position of between 0 degrees and 120 degrees the
   medial femoral condyle does not move anteroposteriorly whereas the
   lateral femoral condyle tends, but is not obliged, to roll back - a
   combination of movements which equates to tibial internal/femoral
   external rotation with flexion. The aim of this paper was to assess if
   the articular geometry of the GMK Sphere TKA could recreate the natural
   knee movements in situ/in vivo.
   Methods
   The pattern of knee movement was studied in 15 patients (six male: nine
   female; one male with bilateral TKAs) with 16 GMK Sphere implants, at a
   mean age of 66 years (53 to 76) with a mean BMI of 30 kg/m(2) (20 to
   35). The motions of all 16 knees were observed using pulsed fluoroscopy
   during a number of weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing static and
   dynamic activities.
   Results
   During maximally flexed kneeling and lunging activities, the mean tibial
   internal rotation was 8 degrees (standard deviation (sd) 6). At a mean
   112 degrees flexion (sd 16) during lunging, the medial and lateral
   condyles were a mean of 2 mm (sd 3) and 8 mm (sd 4) posterior to a
   transverse line passing through the centre of the medial tibial
   concavity. With a mean flexion of 117 degrees (sd 14) during kneeling,
   the medial and lateral condyles were a mean of 1 mm (sd 4) anterior and
   6 mm (sd 4) posterior to the same line. During dynamic stair and
   pivoting activities, there was a mean anteroposterior translation of 0
   mm to 2 mm of the medial femoral condyle. Backward lateral condylar
   translation occurred and was linearly related to tibial rotation.
   Conclusion
   The GMK Sphere TKA in our study group shows movements similar in
   pattern, although reduced in magnitude, to those in recent reports
   relating to normal knees during several activities. Specifically, little
   or no translation of the medial femoral condyle was observed during
   flexion, but there was posterior roll-back of the lateral femoral
   condyle, equating to tibiofemoral rotation. We conclude that the GMK
   Sphere is anteroposteriorly stable medially and permits rotation about
   the medial compartment.}},

Abstract = {{Reinforcement learning (RL) has had mixed success when applied to games.
   Large state spaces and the curse of dimensionality have limited the
   ability for RL techniques to learn to play complex games in a reasonable
   length of time. We discuss a modification of Q-learning to use nearest
   neighbor states to exploit previous experience in the early stages of
   learning. A weighting on the state features is learned using metric
   learning techniques, such that neighboring states represent similar game
   situations. Our method is tested on the arcade game Frogger, and it is
   shown that some of the effects of the curse of dimensionality can be
   mitigated.}},

Title = {{Two-Dimensional Evolutionary Spectrum Approach to Nonstationary Fading

Volume = {{65}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Broadband mobile communication systems experience fading over a wide
   frequency band, which induces severe intersymbol interference and
   drastic channel gain fluctuation, resulting in a time-frequency doubly
   selective fading channel gain. Most existing works on fading channel
   modeling assume wide-sense stationarity with respect to (w.r.t.) time
   and uncorrelated scattering w.r.t. delay. However, due to the
   time-varying movement of mobile terminals, fading is usually
   nonstationary w.r.t. time, i.e., the Doppler spectrum is nonstationary.
   In addition, electromagnetic signals reflected/scattered from the same
   clustter/object are correlated and may induce nonstationarity w.r.t.
   delay due to time-varying cluster environments, e.g., wind causes the
   movement of leaves, resulting in time-varying scattering of leaves. To
   model nonstationary broadband mobile fading channels, this paper
   introduces a two-dimensional evolutionary spectrum (2-D ES) approach,
   which is compatible with the power spectral density of a stationary
   process. Based on the 2-D ES, we also propose an estimation method to
   estimate the 2-D ES parameters from a trace (sample path) of a fading
   process. Furthermore, we show how to set up a simulator to generate a
   2-D stationary or nonstationary fading process according to our
   developed 2-D ES framework. Using the 2-D ES approach, we analyze a
   class of Nakagami-m channels which is nonstationary in both the time and
   frequency domains. Two examples are used to show the accuracy of our
   developed 2-D ES-based channel modeling approach.}},

Abstract = {{Submarine ground water discharges (SGD) around the coasts of the Yucatan
   Peninsula are very common due to the karstic origin of the rocks, and
   the abundant rain. These discharges of brackish water into the coastal
   sea are strong enough to alter the thermohaline conditions, they can be
   preferential routes for salt intrusion, and also represent an important
   input of nutrients and pollutants. The mixing on these SGDs is a
   spontaneous and turbulent process, and its study is important for the
   understanding of dispersion of materials in regions influenced by these
   features. A set of measurements with two acoustic Doppler velochneters
   (Nortek-Vector) were done in a very active SGD in the coast of Quintana
   Roo, Mexico. The first instrument was installed in the entrance of the
   cave and the other one similar to 2m above, both sampling at 64 Hz.
   Consistent with previous studies, results show that sea level
   variability (waves and tides) dominates the flow and the turbulence
   levels. When the spring is inactive wave frequencies (short 0.1 Hz, and
   0.03 Hz long waves) have a clear peak in eta i and w, but when the
   spring is active, turbulence (Kolmogorov law) permeates to short wave
   frequencies, and IG frequencies diminish in 11, but bulge in w at lower
   frequencies (0.01 Hz). Numerical modelling with Open Foam suggests that
   the shift in IG frequency could be driven by the spring geometry (depth
   and cave size) rather than forced by the incident waves.}},

   regression is used for extracting damage sensitive features of a Lamb

   probability. We use minimum squared prediction error to find the optimum
   number of features and the window inside a Lamb wave signal that is most
   sensitive to the fatigue damage. Method is illustrated on real sensor

Abstract = {{This study contributes by presenting an empirical assessment of the
   accuracy of the target year populations synthesized with different
   base-year populations, data-fusion methods, and control tables.
   Forty-five synthetic populations were generated for 12 census tracts in
   Florida for this purpose. The empirical results indicate the value of
   synthesizing base year populations more accurately by accommodating
   multi-level controls. Although fewer controls are typically available
   for target years, the use of multi-level controls in the target year
   with appropriate synthesis methods does benefit the accuracy of the
   synthetic population. This study also establishes that the magnitude of
   the overall error in the synthesized population appears to be linearly
   related to the magnitude of the input errors introduced via the control
   tables. The improvements in accuracy are statistically significant and
   hold after controlling for differences in population sizes and growth
   rates for the different census tracts. Overall, efforts to accurately
   synthesize base-year populations and to good forecasts of target-year
   controls can help synthesize accurate target-year populations. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The private provision of public roads via the build-operate-transfer
   (BOT) mode has been increasingly used around the world. By viewing a BOT
   contract as a combination of road capacity, toll and government
   guarantee, this paper investigates optimal concession contract design
   under both symmetric and asymmetric information about the marginal
   maintenance cost of private investors. Under asymmetric information, the
   government guarantee serves as an instrument to induce a private
   investor to reveal his true cost information. Compared with the
   situation under symmetric information, the government will suffer a loss
   of social welfare; the private investor will charge a higher toll that
   increases in his reported marginal maintenance cost, and specify a lower
   capacity that decreases with the reported cost. The results also show
   that the private investor obtains extra information rent beyond the
   reservation level of return and the rent decreases with his reported
   cost. However, the resulting volume-capacity ratios of the BOT road
   under both information structures are the same. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Ballistic thermal conductance in single-layer MoS2 and black phosphorus
   (BP) is calculated based on the phonon dispersion. In single-layer MoS2,
   the ballistic thermal conductance is almost isotropic of a value of
   10.7x10(8) W/m(2)K; while in single-layer BP, the in-plane ballistic
   thermal conductance is anisotropic with a value of 12.8 x 10(8) W/m(2)K
   in the zigzag direction and 7.1 x 10(8) W/m(2)K in the armchair
   direction. Thermal transport behaviors at both steady state and
   transient state in double-gated MOSFET-like transistors with
   single-layer MoS2 and BP used as the channel material are studied. The
   conventional Fourier's law with contact temperatures as the boundary
   conditions and modified boundary conditions that can capture
   quasi-ballistic phonon transport effects are used. The simulation
   results show that Fourier's law with contact temperatures as the
   boundary conditions underestimate the peak temperature rise by 64\% in
   single-layer MoS2 transistors and 56\% in single-layer BP transistors
   when the channel length is comparable to the phonon mean free path. And
   the strong anisotropic thermal properties of single-layer BP lead to
   higher temperature rise in the armchair direction than that in the
   zigzag direction.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the development of an analytical formulation for
   estimating the potential on the soil surface, caused by electric current
   calculated on a grounding conductor. The formulation has a great
   significance in its use in conjunction with 1-D numerical methods, which
   are not able to determine such potentials directly. The proposed study
   focuses on lightning surges considering the frequency dependence of the
   soil properties. First, the subject is introduced emphasizing important
   aspects related to the analysis and representation of grounding systems
   against lightning. Afterward, the proposed analytical formulation is
   introduced with a focus on the computational implementation of the
   transmission line modeling method in 1-D. Simulations were carried out
   considering a typical horizontal electrode used as grounding in the
   power electric system. The formulation was validated by comparing the
   results with the solution based on the electromagnetic model (CDEGS
   Software), which is considered the most stringent for the solution of
   full Maxwell equations due to their minimum approaches. The results
   demonstrate that the generalized formulation presents good accuracy,
   contributing to an improved representation of grounding systems based on
   numerical techniques in 1-D.}},

Abstract = {{The reliability and real time of industrial wireless sensor networks
   (IWSNs) are the absolute requirements for industrial systems, which are
   two foremost obstacles for the large-scale applications of IWSNs. This
   paper studies the multi-objective node placement problem to guarantee
   the reliability and real time of IWSNs from the perspective of systems.
   A novel multi-objective node deployment model is proposed in which the
   reliability, real time, costs and scalability of IWSNs are addressed.
   Considering that the optimal node placement is an NP-hard problem, a new
   multi-objective binary differential evolution harmony search (MOBDEHS)
   is developed to tackle it, which is inspired by the mechanism of harmony
   search and differential evolution. Three large-scale node deployment
   problems are generated as the benCHmarks to verify the proposed model
   and algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the developed
   model is valid and can be used to design large-scale IWSNs with
   guaranteed reliability and real-time performance efficiently. Moreover,
   the comparison results indicate that the proposed MOBDEHS is an
   effective tool for multi-objective node placement problems and superior
   to Pareto-based binary differential evolution algorithms, nondominated
   sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) and modified NSGA-II.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE To develop a device intended for gradual venous occlusion over
   4 to 6 weeks.
   SAMPLE
   Silicone tubing filled with various inorganic salt and polyacrylic acid
   (PAA) formulations and mounted within a polypropylene or polyether ether
   ketone (PEEK) outer ring.
   PROCEDURES
   15 polypropylene prototype rings were initially filled with 1 of 5
   formulations and placed in PBSS. In a second test, 10 polypropylene and
   7 PEEK prototype rings were filled with 1 formulation and placed in
   PBSS. In a third test, 2 formulations were loaded into 6 PEEK rings
   each, placed in physiologic solution, and incubated. In all tests, ring
   luminal diameter, outer diameter, and luminal area were measured over 6
   weeks.
   RESULTS
   In the first test, 2 formulations had the greatest changes in luminal
   area and diameter, and 1 of those had a greater linear swell rate than
   the other had. In the second test, 6 of 7 PEEK rings and 6 of 10
   polypropylene rings closed to a luminal diamater <1 mm within 6 weeks.
   Polypropylene rings had a greater increase in outer diameter than did
   PEEK rings between 4.5 and 6 weeks. In the third test, 11 of 12 PEEK
   rings gradually closed to a luminal diameter <1 mm within 6 weeks.
   CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE
   A PAA and inorganic salt formulation in a prototype silicone and polymer
   ring resulted in gradual occlusion over 4 to 6 weeks in vitro. Prototype
   PEEK rings provided more reliable closure than did polypropylene rings.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we derive a strengthened MILP formulation for certain gas
   turbine unit commitment problems, in which the ramping rates are no
   smaller than the minimum generation amounts. This type of gas turbines
   can usually start-up faster and have a larger ramping rate, as compared
   to the traditional coalfired power plants. Recently, the number of this
   type of gas turbines increases significantly due to affordable gas
   prices and their scheduling flexibilities to accommodate intermittent
   renewable energy generation. In this study, several new families of
   strong valid inequalities are developed to help reduce the computational
   time to solve these types of problems. Meanwhile, the validity and
   facet-defining proofs are provided for certain inequalities. Finally,
   numerical experiments on a modified IEEE 118-bus system and the power
   system data based on recent studies verify the effectiveness of applying
   our formulation to model and solve this type of gas turbine unit
   commitment problems, including reducing the computational time to obtain
   an optimal solution or obtaining a much smaller optimality gap, as
   compared to the default CPLEX, when the time limit is reached with no
   optimal solutions obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Most of the 21 inlets along the 588 km of sandy shoreline on the Florida
   east coast have been modified, primarily to improve navigation
   efficiency and safety. These modifications have usually caused
   significant downdrift shoreline erosion. Shoreline change data for the
   Florida east coast during the period from about 1869 to 1971, which was
   before widespread beach nourishment, are analyzed. Modified inlets
   during this period impacted about 25\% of the shoreline and
   conservatively caused about 70\% of the shoreline area recession and
   about 75-85\% if counties are excluded that did not have modified inlets
   that caused net downdrift recession. During this same period of about
   100 years, the remaining 75\% of the shoreline advanced on average 46 m
   seaward. However, before Florida began regulating coastal construction,
   development often encroached on accreting shorelines, effectively
   masking much of the accretion. From about 1971 to 2007, a period of
   widespread beach nourishment, only about half of the nourishment sand
   was placed on eroding shorelines. About half was placed on shorelines
   that accreted or were stable from about 1869 to 1971 but where
   encroachment by development made the nourishment necessary. Over half of
   the recession caused by modified inlets still exists. The criteria used
   by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to designate the
   erosional state of Florida east coast beaches was found to be
   problematic, since it currently designates 65\% of this shoreline as
   eroding when only 20\% eroded during the period of widespread beach
   nourishment from about 1971 to 2007.}},

Abstract = {{Using geographic information system and topographic maps, 5829 headwater
   streams in Florida were surveyed for several parameters including
   elevation, stream length, flow regime and surrounding geology, and
   vegetation. Each was assigned to one of four headwater types: wetland,
   seep, lake, and spring. Wetland headwaters were the most common and
   widespread followed by seeps, many displaying temporary flow, while
   springs were perennial and least numerous. Four groups of Florida rivers
   were identified through cluster analysis of drainage densities (number
   headwaters/km of river length). Group 1 consisted of six rivers with
   lowest drainage densities (0.30-1.39 streams/km main channel). All were
   coastal rivers of peninsular Florida and, with one exception, drain to
   the Gulf of Mexico. Seven of eight rivers (group 2) with intermediate
   drainage densities (1.77-3.04 streams/km main channel) were located in
   peninsular Florida. Only three of 12 rivers comprising the two groups
   (groups 3 and 4) with greatest drainage densities (5.16-9.37 and
   15.49-16.96 streams/km main channel) were not located in the Florida
   panhandle. Stream conservation efforts should focus on both highly
   complex dendritic river networks of the panhandle and on the 7000km(2)

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{32}},
Pages = {{35-45}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{As increasing effort is dedicated to investigating the regenerative
   capacity of decellularized tissues, research has progressed to
   recellularizing these tissues prior to implantation. The delivery and
   support of cells seeded throughout acellular scaffolds are typically
   conducted through the vascular axis of the tissues. However, it is
   unclear how cell concentration and injection frequency can affect the
   distribution of cells throughout the scaffold. Furthermore, what effects
   re-endothelialization have on vascular patency and function are not well
   understood. We investigated the use of ultrasound-guided photoacoustic
   (US/PA) imaging as a technique to visualize the distribution of
   microvascular endothelial cells within an optimized acellular construct
   upon re-endothelialization and perfusion conditioning. We also evaluated
   the vascular performance of the re-endothelialized scaffold using
   quantitative vascular corrosion casting (qVCC) and whole-blood
   perfusion. We found US/PA imaging was an effective technique to
   visualize the distribution of cells. Cellular retention following
   perfusion conditioning was also detected with US/PA imaging. Finally, we
   demonstrated that a partial recovery of vascular performance is possible
   following re-endothelialization confirmed by fewer extravasations in
   qVCC and improved blood clearance following whole-blood perfusion.
   Statement of Significance
   Re-endothelialization is a method that enables decellularized tissue to
   become useful as a tissue engineering construct by creating a nutrient
   delivery and waste removal system for the entire construct. Our approach
   utilizes a decellularization method that retains the basement ECM of a
   highly vascularized tissue upon which endothelial cells can be injected
   to form an endothelium. The US/PA method allows for rapid visualization
   of cells within a construct several cm thick. This approach can be
   experimentally used to observe changes in cellular distribution over
   large intervals of time, to help optimize cell seeding parameters, and
   to verify cell retention within re-endothelialized constructs. This
   approach has temporal and depth advantages compared to section
   reconstruction and imaged fluorophores respectively. (C) 2015 Acta

Abstract = {{In this study, we developed a dual-modality tomographic system that
   integrated photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and diffuse optical tomography
   (DOT) into a single platform for imaging human finger joints with fine
   structures and associated optical properties. In PAI, spherical focused
   transducers were utilized to collect acoustic signals, and the concept
   of virtual detector was applied in a conventional back-projection
   algorithm to improve the image quality. A finite-element based
   reconstruction algorithm was employed to quantitatively recover optical
   property distribution in the objects for DOT. The phantom results
   indicate that PAI has a maximum lateral resolution of 70 mu m in
   resolving structures of targets. DOT was able to recover both optical
   absorption and reduced scattering coefficients of targets accurately. To
   validate the potential of this system in clinical diagnosis of joint
   diseases, the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints of 4 healthy female
   volunteers were imaged. We successfully obtained high-resolution images
   of the phalanx and the surrounding soft tissue via PAI, and recovered
   both optical absorption and reduced scattering coefficients of phalanx
   using DOT. The in vivo results suggest that this dual-modality system
   has the potential for the early diagnosis of joint diseases such as
   osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).}},

Abstract = {{High-fidelity intracranial electrode arrays for recording and
   stimulating brain activity have facilitated major advances in the
   treatment of neurological conditions over the past decade. Traditional
   arrays require direct implantation into the brain via open craniotomy,
   which can lead to inflammatory tissue responses, necessitating
   development of minimally invasive approaches that avoid brain trauma.
   Here we demonstrate the feasibility of chronically recording brain
   activity from within a vein using a passive stent-electrode recording
   array (stentrode). We achieved implantation into a superficial cortical
   vein overlying the motor cortex via catheter angiography and demonstrate
   neural recordings in freely moving sheep for up to 190 d. Spectral
   content and bandwidth of vascular electrocorticography were comparable
   to those of recordings from epidural surface arrays. Venous internal
   lumen patency was maintained for the duration of implantation.
   Stentrodes may have wide ranging applications as a neural interface for
   treatment of a range of neurological conditions.}},

Title = {{The Interfacial Behavior between Biochar and Soil Minerals and Its
   Effect on Biochar Stability}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{2264-2271}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{In this study, FeCl3, AlCl3, CaCl2, and kaolinite were selected as model
   soil minerals and incubated with walnut shell derived biochar for 3
   months and the incubated biochar was then separated for the
   investigation of biochar mineral interfacial behavior using XRD and
   SEM-EDS. The XPS, TGA, and H2O2 oxidation were applied to evaluate
   effects of the interaction on the stability of biochar.
   Fe8O8(OH)(8)Cl-1.35 and AlCl3 center dot 6H(2)O were newly formed on the
   biochar surface or inside of the biochar pores. At the biochar-mineral
   interface, organometallic complexes such as Fe-O-C were generated. All
   the 4 minerals enhanced the oxidation resistance of biochar surface by
   decreasing the relative contents of C-O, C=O, and COOH from 36.3\% to
   16.6-26.5\%. Oxidation resistance of entire biochar particles was
   greatly increased with C losses in H2O2 oxidation decreasing by
   13.4-79.6\%, and the C recalcitrance index (R-50,R-bicohar) in TGA
   analysis increasing from 44.6\% to 45.9-49.6\%. Enhanced oxidation
   resistance of biochar surface was likely due to the physical isolation
   from newly formed minerals, while organometallic complex formation was
   probably responsible for the increase in oxidation resistance of entire
   biochar particles. Results indicated that mineral-rich soils seemed to
   be a beneficial environment for biochar since soil minerals could
   increase biochar stability, which displays an important environmental
   significance of biochar for long-term carbon sequestration.}},

Abstract = {{Recovery of the end-of-use products has become a topic of considerable
   interest in the advanced manufacturing industry due in part to
   uncertainties in the quality and volume of product returns. The Internet

   analyzing the product life cycle data for each individual item can
   mitigate or eliminate these uncertainties. In this paper, an integrated
   three-stage model is presented based on IoT technology for the
   optimization of procurement, production and product recovery, pricing
   and strategy of return acquisition. The remaining value is used to
   measure the return condition. The model considers three recovery options
   related to refurbishing, component reuse and disposal, and the value
   deterioration for satisfying the product demand in each stage of product
   life cycle (PLC). A novel particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm
   based on two heuristic methods is proposed to solve the problem. A
   numerical example and sensitivity analysis are used to illustrate the
   performance of both algorithm and applicability of the model.}},

Abstract = {{Uncertainty forecasting in orbital mechanics is an essential but
   difficult task, primarily because the underlying Fokker-Planck equation
   (FPE) is defined on a relatively high dimensional (6-D) state-space and
   is driven by the nonlinear perturbed Keplerian dynamics. In addition, an
   enormously large solution domain is required for numerical solution of
   this FPE (e.g. encompassing the entire orbit in the subspace), of which
   the state probability density function (pdf) occupies a tiny fraction at
   any given time. This coupling of large size, high dimensionality and
   nonlinearity makes for a formidable computational task, and has caused
   the FPE for orbital uncertainty propagation to remain an unsolved
   problem. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper presents the
   first successful direct solution of the FPE for perturbed Keplerian
   mechanics. To tackle the dimensionality issue, the time-varying state
   pdf is approximated in the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition tensor form
   where all the six spatial dimensions as well as the time dimension are
   separated from one other. The pdf approximation for all times is
   obtained simultaneously via the alternating least squares algorithm.
   Chebyshev spectral differentiation is employed for discretization on
   account of its spectral ({''}super-fast{''}) convergence rate. To
   facilitate the tensor decomposition and control the solution domain
   size, system dynamics is expressed using spherical coordinates in a
   noninertial reference frame. Numerical results obtained on a regular
   personal computer are compared with Monte Carlo simulations.}},

Title = {{WBSP: A Novel Synchronization Mechanism for Architecture Parallel
   Simulation}},

Abstract = {{Parallelization is an efficient approach to accelerate multi-core,
   multi-processor and cluster architecture simulators. Nevertheless,
   frequent synchronization can significantly hinder the performance of a
   parallel simulator. A common practice in alleviating synchronization
   cost is to relax synchronization using lengthened synchronous steps.
   However, as a side effect, simulation accuracy deteriorates
   considerably. Through analyzing various factors contributing to the
   causality error in lax synchronization, we observe that a coherent speed
   across all nodes is critical to achieve high accuracy. To this end, we
   propose wall-clock based synchronization (WBSP), a novel mechanism that
   uses wall-clock time to maintain a coherent running speed across the
   different nodes by periodically synchronizing simulated clocks with the
   wall clock within each lax step. Our proposed method only results in a
   modest precision loss while achieving performance close to lax
   synchronization. We implement WBSP in a many-core parallel simulator and
   a cluster parallel simulator. Experimental results show that at a scale
   of 32-host threads, it improves the performance of the many-core
   simulator by 4.3 x on average with less than a 5.5 percent accuracy loss
   compared to the conservative mechanism. On the cluster simulator with 64
   nodes, our proposed scheme achieves an 8.3 x speedup compared to the
   conservative mechanism while yielding only a 1.7 percent accuracy loss.
   Meanwhile, WBSP outperforms the recent proposed adaptive mechanism on
   simulations that exhibit heavy traffic.}},

Abstract = {{AimsState-of-the-art bioaerosol samplers have poor collection
   efficiencies for ultrafine virus aerosols. This work evaluated the
   performance of a novel growth tube collector (GTC), which utilizes
   laminar-flow water-based condensation to facilitate particle growth, for
   the collection of airborne MS2 viruses.
   Methods and ResultsFine aerosols (<500nm) containing MS2 coliphage were
   generated from a Collison nebulizer, conditioned by a dilution dryer and
   collected by a GTC and a BioSampler. The GTC effectively condensed water
   vapour onto the virus particles, creating droplets 2-5m in diameter,
   which facilitated collection. Comparison of particle counts upstream and
   downstream revealed that the GTC collected >93\% of the inlet virus
   particles, whereas the BioSampler's efficiency was about 10\%. Viable
   counts of the GTC-collected viruses were also one order of magnitude
   higher than those of the BioSampler (P=0003).
   ConclusionThe efficiency of the GTC for the viable collection of MS2
   viruses exceeds that of industry standard instrument, the BioSampler, by
   a factor of 10-100.
   Significance and Impact of the StudyThis study reveals that the GTC is
   an effective collector of viable MS2 aerosols, and concludes the
   instrument will be an effective tool for studying viable virus aerosols
   and the inhalation risks posed by airborne viruses.}},

Abstract = {{Biosynthesis and accumulation of jasmonate (JA) can regulate plant
   defense responses and organ development under insect herbivore stress
   conditions. One of these responses, the inhibition of root growth, is a
   common phenomenon. However, the physiological and molecular mechanisms
   of how JA affects root growth are not completely understood. In this
   study, the influence of MeJA treatment on auxin and proton flux rates in
   the root apex region of Col-0, coil-1, pin2, and aux1-7 mutant lines was
   examined using a non-invasive micro-test technique. The auxin and H+
   flux profiles taken from coil-1 mutants suggest that the modulation of
   auxin and H+ flux by JA requires the function of COI1. The auxin and H+
   flux in pin2 and aux1 mutants with and without JA treatment suggest that
   JA can affect polar auxin transport by regulating PIN-mediated auxin
   efflux and the AUX-mediated influx pathways. Furthermore, the expression
   levels of PIN1, PIN2, PIN3, PIN7, AUX1, and TIR1 genes were reduced
   under MeJA treatment, and expression levels of CYP79B2 and CYP79B3 were
   elevated. Together, these results suggest that JA signaling may modulate
   the auxin signaling pathways by regulating the expression of key genes.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogels can be synthesized with most of the properties needed for
   biomaterials applications. Soft, wettable, and highly permeable gels
   with a practically unlimited breadth of chemical functionalities are
   routinely made in the laboratory. However, the ability to make highly
   elastic and durable hydrogels remains limited. Here we describe an
   approach to generate stretchy, durable hydrogels, employing a high
   polymer-to-crosslink ratio for extensibility, combined with an
   aggregating copolymer phase to provide stability against swelling. We
   find that the addition of aggregating co-polymer can produce a highly
   extensible gel that fails at 1000\% strain, recovers from large strains
   within a few minutes, maintains its elasticity over repeated cycles of
   large amplitude strain, and exhibits significantly reduced swelling. We
   find that the gel's enhanced mechanical performance comes from a
   kinetically arrested structure that arises from a competition between
   the disparate polymerization rates of the two components and the
   aggregation rate of the unstable phase. These results represent an
   alternative strategy to generating the type of stretchy elastomer-like
   hydrogels needed for biomedical technologies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filled with certain alumina additives has
   wear rates over four orders of magnitude lower than unfilled PTFE. The
   mechanisms for this wear reduction have remained a mystery. In this
   work, we use a combination of techniques to show that porous,
   nanostructured alumina micro fillers (not nanofillers) are critical for
   this wear reduction. The microscale alumina particles break during
   sliding into nanoscale fragments. X-ray microtomography, transmission
   electron microscopy and infrared spectroscopy reveal nanoscale alumina
   fragments accumulated in the tribofilms. Tribochemically generated
   carboxylate endgroups bond to metal species in the transfer film and to
   alumina fragments in the surface of the polymer composite. These
   mechanically reinforced tribofilms create robust sliding surfaces and
   lead to a dramatic reduction in wear. (C) 2015 The Authors and E.I.

Abstract = {{Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has been used to restore
   immune competence following chemoablative cancer therapy and to promote
   immunological tolerance in certain settings of autoimmunity. Therefore,
   we tested the potential of G-CSF to impact type 1 diabetes (T1D)
   progression in patients with recent-onset disease {[}n=14; n=7
   (placebo)] and assessed safety, efficacy and mechanistic effects on the
   immune system. We hypothesized that pegylated G-CSF (6mg administered
   subcutaneously every 2 weeks for 12 weeks) would promote regulatory T
   cell (T-reg) mobilization to a degree capable of restoring immunological
   tolerance, thus preventing further decline in C-peptide production.
   Although treatment was well tolerated, G-CSF monotherapy did not affect
   C-peptide production, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) or insulin dose.
   Mechanistically, G-CSF treatment increased circulating neutrophils
   during the 12-week course of therapy (P<001) but did not alter T-reg
   frequencies. No effects were observed for CD4(+):CD8(+) T cell ratio or
   the ratio of naive:memory (CD45RA(+)/CD45RO(+)) CD4(+) T cells. As
   expected, manageable bone pain was common in subjects receiving G-CSF,
   but notably, no severe adverse events such as splenomegaly occurred.
   This study supports the continued exploration of G-CSF and other
   mobilizing agents in subjects with T1D, but only when combined with
   immunodepleting agents where synergistic mechanisms of action have
   previously demonstrated efficacy towards the preservation of C-peptide.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present an experimental study on plastic deformation
   and damage of polycrystalline pure HCP Ti, as well as modeling of the
   observed behavior. Mechanical characterization data were conducted,
   which indicate that the material is orthotropic and displays
   tension-compression asymmetry. The ex-situ and in-situ X-ray tomography
   measurements conducted reveal that damage distribution and evolution in
   this HCP Ti material is markedly different than in a typical FCC
   material such as copper. Stewart and Cazacu (2011) anisotropic
   elastic/plastic damage model is used to describe the behavior. All the
   parameters involved in this model have a clear physical significance,
   being related to plastic properties, and are determined from very few
   simple mechanical tests. It is shown that this model predicts correctly
   the anisotropy in plastic deformation, and its strong influence on
   damage distribution and damage accumulation. Specifically, for a smooth
   axisymmetric specimen subject to uniaxial tension, damage initiates at
   the center of the specimen, and is diffuse; the level of damage close to
   failure being very low. On the other hand, for a notched specimen
   subject to the same loading the model predicts that damage initiates at
   the outer surface of the specimen, and further grows from the outer
   surface to the center of the specimen, which corroborates with the
   in-situ tomography data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Past studies of commercial, industrial, and institutional (CII) water
   use efficiency have been limited to simple normalization benchmarking
   measures. Simple normalization ratios (e.g., water use per employee)
   account for only one driver of water use and are often misleading
   because of the predominantly skewed nature of water use intensities. In
   order to improve on benchmarking systems to assess the water use
   efficiency of CII customers, this paper explores two popular methods
   used in the energy efficiency field: ordinary least squares (OLS) and
   data envelopment analysis (DEA). Parcel-level data from Austin, Texas,
   is used to demonstrate the methods, where a data-driven approach is
   employed to include average water use, building area, building value,
   year built, parcel area, and number of employees as measures of input,
   and annual sales as the economic measure of output. (C) 2015 American

Abstract = {{An indicator of the disturbance of natural systems, the landscape
   development intensity (LDI) index, was used to assess the potential for
   land-use within watersheds to influence the production/accumulation of
   methyl-mercury (MeHg) in river sediments. Sediment samples were
   collected from locations impacted by well-identified land-use types
   within the Mobile-Alabama River Basin in Southeastern USA. The samples
   were analyzed for total-Hg (THg) and MeHg concentrations and the
   obtained values correlated to the calculated LDI indexes of the sampled
   watersheds to assess the impact of prevalent land use/land cover on MeHg
   accumulation in sediments. The results show that unlike THg, levels of
   MeHg found in sediments are impacted by the LDI indexes. Overall,
   certain combinations of land-use types within a given watershed appear
   to be more conducive to MeHg accumulation than others, therefore,
   pointing to the possibility of targeting land-use practices as potential
   means for reducing MeHg accumulation in sediments, and ultimately, fish
   contamination.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{244-249}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A theoretical model of a power-law graded elastic half-space in contact
   with a randomly rough rigid surface is established by combining the
   Greenwood-Williamson rough contact model and the JKR type adhesion model
   for power-law graded materials. The rough surface is modeled as an
   ensemble of non-interacting asperities with identical radius of
   curvature and Gaussian distributed heights. By applying the JKR type
   theory for power-law graded solids to each individual asperity of the
   rough surface, the total normal forces for the rough surface are derived
   for loading and unloading stages, respectively, and a prominent adhesion
   hysteresis associated with dissipation energy is revealed. Our results
   include the solutions for homogeneous materials and Gibson solids as
   special cases and describe the complete transition between these two
   limiting situations. A dimensionless adhesion parameter, which
   influences both the total pull-off force and the energy dissipation due
   to adhesive hysteresis, is also identified. It is found that a small
   adhesion parameter results in higher energy dissipation and pull-off
   force, while a large adhesion parameter leads to lower energy
   dissipation and pull-off force. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Under combined rolling and sliding materials can experience millions of

   dramatically affect their friction and wear behaviour. It was shown that
   for a carbon black-filled natural rubber compound in combined rolling

   coefficient, as a function of slip percent, was dependent upon the
   normal load and independent of rolling velocity. The wear rate of this
   material pair was found to be independent of slip percentage as well as
   rolling velocity but dependent upon sliding distance. The wear rate was
   found to be approximately the same for all tested cases (K similar to
   1x10(-4)mm(3)Nm(-1)). The worn profiles of the ball specimens showed
   that this wear occurred preferentially on the left side (inner radius)

Abstract = {{In this paper, we generalize the well-known Nesterov's accelerated
   gradient (AG) method, originally designed for convex smooth
   optimization, to solve nonconvex and possibly stochastic optimization
   problems. We demonstrate that by properly specifying the stepsize
   policy, the AG method exhibits the best known rate of convergence for
   solving general nonconvex smooth optimization problems by using
   first-order information, similarly to the gradient descent method. We
   then consider an important class of composite optimization problems and
   show that the AG method can solve them uniformly, i.e., by using the
   same aggressive stepsize policy as in the convex case, even if the
   problem turns out to be nonconvex. We demonstrate that the AG method
   exhibits an optimal rate of convergence if the composite problem is
   convex, and improves the best known rate of convergence if the problem
   is nonconvex. Based on the AG method, we also present new nonconvex
   stochastic approximation methods and show that they can improve a few
   existing rates of convergence for nonconvex stochastic optimization. To
   the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the convergence
   of the AG method has been established for solving nonconvex nonlinear
   programming in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies four families of polyhedral norms parametrized by a
   single parameter. The first two families consist of the CVaR norm (which
   is equivalent to the D-norm, or the largest- norm) and its dual norm,
   while the second two families consist of the convex combination of the -
   and -norms, referred to as the deltoidal norm, and its dual norm. These
   families contain the - and -norms as special limiting cases. These norms
   can be represented using linear programming (LP) and the size of LP
   formulations is independent of the norm parameters. The purpose of this
   paper is to establish a relation of the considered LP-representable
   norms to the -norm and to demonstrate their potential in optimization.
   On the basis of the ratio of the tight lower and upper bounds of the
   ratio of two norms, we show that in each dual pair, the primal and dual
   norms can equivalently well approximate the - and -norms, respectively,
   for satisfying . In addition, the deltoidal norm and its dual norm are
   shown to have better proximity to the -norm than the CVaR norm and its
   dual. Numerical examples demonstrate that LP solutions with optimized
   parameters attain better approximation of the -norm than the - and
   -norms do.}},

   using X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy and obtained the bandgaps of
   these two materials using reflection electron energy loss spectroscopy.
   The valence band offset was determined to be -0.60 eV +/- 0.04 eV for
   ZrSiO4 on ZnO, while the respective bandgaps were 3.22 eV for ZnO and
   5.9 eV for ZrSiO4. The conduction band offset for ZrSiO4/ZnO was then
   determined to be 3.28 eV. The ZrSiO4/ZnO system has a staggered, type II
   alignment. This means that while ZrSiO4 may be useful for surface
   passivation applications on ZnO, it is not suitable for thin film
   transistors where a positive valence band offset is needed. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{sVarious thin film coatings have been proposed to protect stainless
   steel high level waste (HLW) containers from premature failure due to
   localized corrosion, hydrogen embrittlement, and mechanical wear. These
   coatings include TiN, ZrO2, MoS2, TiO2, and Al2O3, to be deposited
   either in multiple layers or as a thicker, single-layer composite.
   Linear attenuation coefficients of these materials have been simulated
   using MicroShield and measured experimentally for various photon
   energies. Additionally, spent fuel casks with overpacks made of two
   different types of concrete were simulated to compare exposure rate at
   the cask surface. In the energy range that is significant for high level
   waste storage all coating materials possess very similar attenuation
   behavior. A specialty concrete, containing magnetite (Fe3O4) and lead
   oxide (PbO), reduces the exposure rate at the outer surface of the
   overpack by several orders of magnitude. The higher-Z elements not
   present in ordinary concrete greatly increase attenuation of
   intermediate-energy gammas (0.4-1.0 MeV). The thin film coatings do not
   affect the shielding capabilities of the HLW packaging, as their total
   proposed thickness is nearly three orders of magnitude less than the
   mean free path (MFP) of the primary photons of interest. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Core needle biopsy (CNB) is widely used in active surveillance, which is
   the current standard of care for low risk prostate cancers. A longer
   biopsy sample length may improve the accuracy of diagnosis. To increase
   the biopsy sample length, the magnetic abrasive finishing (MAF)
   technique was applied to decrease the needle inner friction force, which
   may hinder the tissue from entering the lumen of the biopsy needle. To
   assess the effectiveness of these MAF polished needles as compared to
   the unpolished needles, a method to measure the three components of
   axial force during hollow needle insertion-tip cutting force, inner
   friction force, and outer friction force-was developed. Six
   tissue-mimicking samples of different lengths were used to find the
   linear relationship between the sum of the cutting force and inner
   friction force and the phantom length or contact length. Linear
   regression method was used to extrapolate and estimate the tip cutting
   force and the inner friction force. With this method, the difference
   between the inner friction force of the needles with and without
   polishing was found. The results showed that the unpolished needles had
   an inner friction force 40-50\% higher and a tip cutting force 22\%
   higher than their MAF polished counterparts. We also found that MAF
   polished needles had an average of 9\% longer contact length between the
   sample and the inner wall than unpolished needles, indicating that a
   longer sample can be extracted at a lower friction force. The results of
   our investigation implied that reducing the inner surface roughness of a
   biopsy needle could reduce inner friction forces.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene-oxide (GO) has been shown to be a promising material for
   numerous technological applications. Extensive computational work has
   been devoted to elucidate the structure, stability and properties of
   different GO species. As some applications require large GO sizes,
   classical molecular dynamics simulations are necessary to fully
   investigate GO properties and behavior. There are few classical force
   fields parameterized to examine oxidized hydrocarbon compounds, and not
   all of them are able to simulate GO structures. Here, we present the
   first comparative study of some GO properties between three classical
   force fields: Reactive Empirical Bond Order for carbon, hydrogen and
   oxygen (REBO-CHO), third generation of the Charge Optimized Many Body
   (COMB3) and Chemistry at HARvard Macromolecular Mechanics (CHARMM) force
   field. The chemical and physical properties tested include key binding
   energies, carbon-oxygen bond distances and elastic modulus. When
   compared to density functional theory calculations or experimental data,
   the COMB3 reactive force field is shown to provide the best overall
   results, while REBO-CHO and CHARMM provide good results for certain
   properties of most GO-systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Datasets with significantly larger number of features, compared to
   samples, pose a serious challenge in supervised learning. Such datasets
   arise in various areas including business analytics. In this paper, a
   new binary classification method called constrained subspace classifier
   (CSC) is proposed for such high dimensional datasets. CSC improves on an
   earlier proposed classification method called local subspace classifier
   (LSC) by accounting for the relative angle between subspaces while
   approximating the classes with individual subspaces. CSC is formulated
   as an optimization problem and can be solved by an efficient alternating
   optimization technique. Classification performance is tested in publicly
   available datasets. The improvement in classification accuracy over LSC
   shows the importance of considering the relative angle between the
   subspaces while approximating the classes. Additionally, CSC appears to
   be a robust classifier, compared to traditional two step methods that
   perform feature selection and classification in two distinct steps. (c)

Abstract = {{Single-layer materials represent a new materials class with properties
   that are potentially transformative for applications in nanoelectronics

   two-dimensional (2D) materials with unusual compositions and structures,

   the structure and composition space while constraining the thickness of
   the structures. Coupling the algorithm to first-principles total-energy
   methods, we show that this approach can successfully identify known 2D
   materials and find low-energy ones. We present the details of the
   algorithm, including suitable objective functions, and illustrate its
   potential with a study of the Sn-S and C-Si binary materials systems.
   The algorithm identifies several 2D structures of InP, recovers known 2D
   structures in the binary Sn-S and C-Si systems, and finds two 1D Si
   defects in graphene with formation energies below that of isolated

Title = {{Stability and magnetism of strongly correlated single-layer VS2}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB 26}},
Abstract = {{Single-layer transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit a variety of
   atomic structures and associated exotic electronic and magnetic
   properties. Density-functional calculations using the LDA+U
   approximation show that single-layer VS2 is a strongly correlated
   material, where the stability, phonon spectra, and magnetic moments of
   the octahedral (1T) and the trigonal prismatic (2H) structures
   significantly depend on the effective Hubbard U parameter, U-eff.
   Comparison with the HSE06 hybrid density functional used as a benchmark
   indicates that U-eff = 2.5 eV, which consistently shows that the 2H
   structure is more stable than the 1T structure and a ferromagnetic
   semiconductor. The magnetic moments are localized on the V atoms and
   coupled ferromagnetically due to the super exchange interactions
   mediated by the S atoms. Calculations of the magnetic anisotropy show an
   easy plane for the magnetic moment. Assuming a classical XY model with
   nearest neighbor coupling, we determine the critical temperature, T-c,
   for the Berezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of 2H single-layer VS2
   to be about 90 K. Applying biaxial tensile strains can increase T-c.
   Using Wannier interpolation, we evaluate the Berry curvature and
   anomalous Hall conductivity of 2H single-layer VS2. The coexistence of
   quasi-long-range ferromagnetic ordering and semiconducting behavior

Abstract = {{Millimeter wave (mmWave) communications in 60 GHz band have become a hot
   topic in wireless communications. New medium access control (MAC)
   protocols are needed because of the fundamental differences between
   mmWave communications and existing other communication systems. In
   mmWave wireless personal area networks, the channel transmission rates
   of links vary significantly because of the difference in the distance
   between nodes, the accuracy of beamforming, and the existence of
   obstructions. Owning to the directivity of mmWave links, spatial reuse
   should be exploited to improve network capacity. In this paper, we
   develop a channel transmission rate aware directional MAC protocol,
   termed RDMAC, in which both the multirate capability of links and
   spatial reuse are exploited to improve network performance. RDMAC has
   two stages. The first stage measures the channel transmission rates of
   links, and a heuristic algorithm is proposed to compute near-optimal
   measurement schedules with respect to the total number of measurements.
   The second stage accommodates the traffic demand of links, and a
   heuristic transmission scheduling algorithm is proposed to compute
   near-optimal transmission schedules with respect to the total
   transmission time. Simulations under various traffic modes show that
   compared with existing protocols, RDMAC has lower network latency,
   higher network throughput, and also a good fairness performance.

Abstract = {{Microelectromechanical (MEMS) mirrors have extended vision capabilities
   onto small, low-power platforms. However, the field-of-view (FOV) of
   these MEMS mirrors is usually less than 90. and any increase in the MEMS
   mirror scanning angle has design and fabrication trade-offs in terms of
   power, size, speed and stability. Therefore, we need techniques to
   increase the scanning range while still maintaining a small form factor.
   In this paper we exploit our recent breakthrough that has enabled the
   immersion of MEMS mirrors in liquid. While allowing the MEMS to move,
   the liquid additionally provides a ``Snell's window{''} effect and
   enables an enlarged FOV (approximate to 150 degrees). We present an
   optimized MEMS mirror design and use it to demonstrate applications in
   extreme wide-angle structured light. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{First-principles calculations are used to compare the binding energies
   of O, OH, and F on two-dimensional, metal carbide and nitride, or MXene,
   surfaces in order to predict the dependence of the thermodynamic
   stability of these compounds on their chemical composition. Solvation
   effects are implicitly included in the calculations to reproduce
   experimental conditions as closely as possible. The results indicate
   that all MXene surfaces are saturated with oxygen when exposed to H2O/HF
   solutions at low hydrogen chemical potential, mu H, and that Sc-based
   MXenes can also be fluorinated in solutions of higher mu H. After
   investigating the thermodynamic stability of all 54 MXene compounds
   Mn+1XnO2 (M = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta; X = C, N; n = 1, 2, 3),
   38 are predicted to have formation energies below 200 meV/atom. Of
   these, six are predicted to have formation energies below 100 meV/atom,
   only one of which has been synthesized. Sc-based MXenes are found to be
   highly stable when their surfaces are terminated with F, which also
   results in the easiest exfoliation to produce freestanding single

Abstract = {{This study explores the effect of substitution of selenium (Se) for
   sulfur (5) on the photophysical properties of a series of pi-conjugated
   donor-acceptor-donor chromophores based on
   4,7-bis(2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (TBT). The effect of Se
   substitution is studied systematically, where the substitution is in the
   thiophene donors only, the benzothiadiazole acceptor only, and in all of
   the positions. The fluorescence quantum yield decreases with an increase
   in Se substitution. Nanosecond-microsecond transient absorption and
   singlet oxygen sensitization experiments show that the effect of Se is
   due to an increase in the rate and efficiency of intersystem crossing
   with increased Se substitution. The relationship between intersystem
   crossing efficiency and heteroatom substitution pattern shows that the
   effects are largest when the heavy atom Se is in the acceptor
   benzothiadiazole unit. DFT calculations support the hypothesis that the
   effect arises because the LUMO is concentrated in the acceptor moiety,
   enhancing the spin-orbit coupling effect imparted by the Se atom.}},

Abstract = {{A photochemical model has been developed to examine the response of the
   nighttime mesosphere to electric field heating. Time dynamics of 29
   chemical species are accounted for by a set of 156 reactions. Recovery
   dynamics of electron density enhancements are examined in detail, and
   the recovery timescales of VLF scattering resulting from the modeled
   conductivity changes are quantitatively estimated. Both typical recovery
   (up to 240s) and long recovery (>300s) timescales of early VLF
   scattering events are explainable in terms of the model results.
   Electron production and loss during recovery is determined by a small
   set of attachment, detachment, and recombination processes. Based on the
   model results, we conclude that long recovery VLF scattering proceeds
   from sufficiently large electron density enhancements that are
   controlled by slow recombination loss (i.e., when attachment loss is
   small or balanced by detachment).}},

Abstract = {{We present simultaneously measured luminosity and electric field data
   from the initial breakdown (IB) stage in seven cloud-to-ground (CG) and
   eight intracloud (IC) lightning discharges along with, in three cases,
   radar and Lightning Mapping Array (LMA) data. The data were taken in
   north-central Florida in 2013 and 2014. Seven CG discharges had an
   arithmetic mean (standard deviation, SD) IB stage luminosity pulse train
   duration of 3ms (2ms), and within the seven CG discharges, 30 luminosity
   pulses had the following means (SD): 10\% to 90\% risetime 25 mu s (16
   mu s), full width at half maximum 68 mu s (21 mu s), and delay between
   onset of the electric field pulse and associated luminosity pulse 8 mu s
   (8 mu s). Eight IC discharges had a mean (SD) IB stage luminosity pulse
   train duration of 11ms (4ms), and within the 8 IC discharges, 37
   luminosity pulses exhibited mean risetimes, widths, and delays of 59 mu
   s (36 mu s), 176 mu s (70 mu s), and 34 mu s (20 mu s), all
   significantly greater than in the CG case. The roughly 10 LMA sources
   associated with each of the three IB stages in 2014 are grouped
   horizontally within about 1km(2). The mean altitude (SD) of the LMA
   points during two CG IB stages is 5km (600m) and 4.3km (250m) and during
   one IC discharge is 6.2km (550m). We discuss the role of optical
   scattering in delaying and distorting the observed luminosity waveforms.}},

Abstract = {{As a low-cost adsorbent, biochar can be used as a low-cost adsorbent for
   wastewater treatment, particularly with respect to treating heavy metals
   in wastewater. A number of studies have demonstrated effective removal
   of heavy metals from aqueous solutions by biochar and, in some cases,
   proven the superiority of biochars to activated carbons. Among several
   factors affecting the sorption ability of biochars, feedstock materials
   play a significant role. This review incorporates existing literature to
   understand the overall sorption behavior of heavy metals on biochar
   adsorbents. Depending on the biochar type, heavy metal can be removed by
   different mechanisms such as complexation, physical sorption,
   precipitation and electrostatic interactions. Mathematical sorption
   models can be used to understand the efficiency of biochar at removing
   heavy metals, and promote the application of biochar technology in water
   treatment.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) is used in various
   applications in uncertain environment. This paper introduces CVaR
   (superquantile) norm for a random variable, which is by definition CVaR
   of absolute value of this random variable. It is proved that CVaR norm
   is indeed a norm in the space of random variables. CVaR norm is defined
   in two variations: scaled and non-scaled. L-1 and L-infinity norms are
   limiting cases of the CVaR norm. In continuous case, scaled CVaR norm is
   a conditional expectation of the random variable. A similar
   representation of CVaR norm is valid for discrete random variables.
   Several properties for scaled and non-scaled CVaR norm, as a function of
   confidence level, were proved. Dual norm for CVaR norm is proved to be
   the maximum of L-1 and scaled L-infinity norms. CVaR norm, as a Measure
   of Error, is related to a Regular Risk Quadrangle. Trimmed L1-norm,
   which is a non-convex extension for CVaR norm, is introduced analogously
   to function L-p for p < 1. Linear regression problems were solved by
   minimizing CVaR norm of regression residuals. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   ``polymer-induced liquid-precursor{''} (PILP) system can restore its
   mechanical properties. Dentin from six-week old Dspp(-/-) and wild-type
   mice was treated with CaP solution containing poly(ASP) for up to 14
   days. Elastic modulus and hardness before and after treatment were
   correlated with mineralization from Micro x-ray computed tomography
   (Micro-XCT). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)/Selected area
   electron diffraction (SAED) were used to compare matrix mineralization
   and crystallography. Mechanical properties of the Dspp(-/-) dentin were
   significantly less than wild-type dentin and recovered significantly
   (P<0.05) after PILP-treatment, reaching values comparable to wild-type
   dentin. Micro-XCT showed mineral recovery similar to wild-type dentin
   after PILP-treatment. TEM/SAED showed repair of patchy mineralization
   and complete mineralization of defective dentin. This approach may lead
   to new strategies for hard tissue repair.}},

Journal = {{CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{114}},

Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{This study examined the dynamics of tidal propagation inside a tropical
   lagoon. Sea surface elevation (inside) and current profiles (at the
   inlet) were examined over 60 days at the Chelem lagoon, which is a
   branched tropical lagoon located in the northern Yucatan Peninsula.
   Tides were predominantly diurnal with a wavelength at least 20 times
   longer than the total length of the basin. Spatial variations of sea
   surface elevation and the longitudinal transport were described in each
   branch by applying a linear analytical model and the results were
   compared to observations. Results showed that the coastal lagoon was
   highly frictional. The tidal signal was attenuated between 30\% and 40\%
   toward the lagoon heads, a result of the balance between pressure
   gradient and frictional forces. A causeway that chokes the western side
   of the lagoon allowed the propagation of the diurnal signal toward the
   west head of the basin but damped the semidiurnal signal. The causeway
   acted as a hydraulic low-pass filter, as in natural choked systems. The
   causeway's filter effect was included in the analytical model by
   optimizing the frictional parameters. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{114}},
Pages = {{54-71}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Analysis of 19-year-long tidal gauge records along the US East Coast has
   revealed the appearance of semidiurnal perturbations to storm surges in
   the South Atlantic Bight. A total of 85 events with semi diurnal-surge
   amplitudes higher than 20\% of the astronomic tidal amplitude and
   durations longer than two days were identified. These semidiurnal surge
   events were triggered by the passage of tropical storms and cold fronts.
   As a consequence of the storm-induced forcing, observed tides were
   delayed and partially damped with respect to the predictions. Such delay
   and damping resulted in a semidiurnal signal on the surge.
   Parallel-to-shore winds in the shelf region between Cape Hatteras and
   the South Atlantic Bight were highly correlated with the generation of
   the semidiurnal perturbations. Increased bottom friction combined with
   Coriolis acceleration, resulting from enhanced wind-driven alongshore
   currents, are proposed to be the primary factors delaying and
   attenuating astronomic tides. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   Endothelial cells (ECs) play an important role in regulating

   study the effect of microgravity on the differentiation of endothelial
   progenitor cells (EPCs) into ECs and the downstream functions of the
   differentiated cells. Initial exposure of EPCs to microgravity indicated
   an inhibition of migratory, proliferative, and antithrombogenic capacity
   of the differentiated ECs. However, our results indicate a potential
   recovery of proliferative and antithrombogenic functions on prolonged

Abstract = {{This study presents a technique to incorporate spheres in a channel flow
   that uses a non-uniform Eulerian grid using immersed boundary methods
   with direct forcing. An efficient algorithm is presented which
   distributes the Lagrangian markers non-uniformly to match the fluid grid
   and keep the number of markers optimized. Also a novel method to
   calculate the area weights of the Lagrangian markers is given. It is
   observed that even the best available algorithms for uniform
   distribution of markers on a sphere resultin a finite error. Using
   vector spherical harmonics, this error is quantified and reduced to
   machine precision. A series of simulations of a stationary and moving
   sphere in a periodic channel at Reynolds number range of 1-100 are
   presented. Results for a sphere in an ambient shear flow in close
   proximity of a wall are also shown, where the present non-uniform
   distribution offers an order of magnitude reduction over uniform
   distribution of Lagrangian markers. Simulations of a random cluster of
   640 monodisperse spherical particles show a 77\% reduction in Lagrangian
   markers with an error of 0.135\% in computing the total drag. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A new empirical variable charge potential has been developed for AlN
   within the third-generation charge optimized many-body (COMB3) potential
   framework. The potential is able to reproduce the fundamental physical
   properties of AlN, including cohesive energy, elastic constants, defect
   formation energies, surface energies and phonon properties of AlN
   obtained from experiments and first-principles calculations. The
   thermodynamic properties of the Al(111)-AlN (10 (1) over bar0) and
   Al2O3(0001)-AlN (10 (1) over bar0) interfaces and the tensile response
   of AlN nanowires and nanotubes are investigated in classical molecular
   dynamical (MD) simulations using this COMB3 potential. The results
   demonstrate that the potential is well suited to model heterogeneous
   materials in the Al-O-N system. Most importantly, the fully
   transferrable potential parameters can be seamlessly coupled with
   existing COMB3 parameters of other elements to enable MD simulations for
   an even wider range of heterogeneous materials systems. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present axisymmetric numerical simulations of shock
   propagation in nitromethane over an aluminum particle for post-shock
   pressures up to 10 GPa. We use the Mie-Gruneisen equation of state to
   describe both the medium and the particle. The numerical method is a
   finite-volume based solver on a Cartesian grid, that allows for
   multi-material interfaces and shocks, and uses a novel constrained
   reinitialization scheme to precisely preserve particle mass and volume.
   We compute the unsteady inviscid drag coefficient as a function of time,
   and show that when normalized by post-shock conditions, the maximum drag
   coefficient decreases with increasing post-shock pressure. We also
   compute the mass-averaged particle pressure and show that the observed
   oscillations inside the particle are on the particle-acoustic time
   scale. Finally, we present simplified point-particle models that can be
   used for macroscale simulations. In the Appendix, we extend the
   isothermal or isentropic assumption concerning the point-force models to
   non-ideal equations of state, thus justifying their use for the current
   problem. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Concentration Sensing by the Moving Nucleus in Cell Fate Determination:
   A Computational Analysis}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 12}},
Abstract = {{During development of the vertebrate neuroepithelium, the nucleus in
   neural progenitor cells (NPCs) moves from the apex toward the base and
   returns to the apex (called interkinetic nuclear migration) at which
   point the cell divides. The fate of the resulting daughter cells is
   thought to depend on the sampling by the moving nucleus of a spatial
   concentration profile of the cytoplasmic Notch intracellular domain
   (NICD). However, the nucleus executes complex stochastic motions
   including random waiting and back and forth motions, which can expose
   the nucleus to randomly varying levels of cytoplasmic NICD. How nuclear
   position can determine daughter cell fate despite the stochastic nature
   of nuclear migration is not clear. Here we derived a mathematical model
   for reaction, diffusion, and nuclear accumulation of NICD in NPCs during
   interkinetic nuclear migration (INM). Using experimentally measured
   trajectory-dependent probabilities of nuclear turning, nuclear waiting
   times and average nuclear speeds in NPCs in the developing zebrafish
   retina, we performed stochastic simulations to compute the nuclear
   trajectory-dependent probabilities of NPC differentiation. Comparison
   with experimentally measured nuclear NICD concentrations and
   trajectory-dependent probabilities of differentiation allowed estimation
   of the NICD cytoplasmic gradient. Spatially polarized production of
   NICD, rapid NICD cytoplasmic consumption and the time-averaging effect
   of nuclear import/export kinetics are sufficient to explain the
   experimentally observed differentiation probabilities. Our computational
   studies lend quantitative support to the feasibility of the nuclear
   concentration-sensing mechanism for NPC fate determination in zebrafish
   retina.}},

Title = {{Restoring Behavior via Inverse Neurocontroller in a Lesioned Cortical
   Spiking Model Driving a Virtual Arm}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{FEB 9}},
Abstract = {{Neural stimulation can be used as a tool to elicit natural sensations or
   behaviors by modulating neural activity. This can be potentially used to
   mitigate the damage of brain lesions or neural disorders. However, in
   order to obtain the optimal stimulation sequences, it is necessary to
   develop neural control methods, for example by constructing an inverse
   model of the target system. For real brains, this can be very
   challenging, and often unfeasible, as it requires repeatedly stimulating
   the neural system to obtain enough probing data, and depends on an
   unwarranted assumption of stationarity. By contrast, detailed brain
   simulations may provide an alternative testbed for understanding the
   interactions between ongoing neural activity and external stimulation.
   Unlike real brains, the artificial system can be probed extensively and
   precisely, and detailed output information is readily available. Here we
   employed a spiking network model of sensorimotor cortex trained to drive
   a realistic virtual musculoskeletal arm to reach a target. The network
   was then perturbed, in order to simulate a lesion, by either silencing
   neurons or removing synaptic connections. All lesions led to significant
   behvaioral impairments during the reaching task. The remaining cells
   were then systematically probed with a set of single and multiple-cell
   stimulations, and results were used to build an inverse model of the
   neural system. The inverse model was constructed using a kernel adaptive
   filtering method, and was used to predict the neural stimulation pattern
   required to recover the pre-lesion neural activity. Applying the derived
   neurostimulation to the lesioned network improved the reaching behavior
   performance. This work proposes a novel neurocontrol method, and
   provides theoretical groundwork on the use biomimetic brain models to
   develop and evaluate neurocontrollers that restore the function of
   damaged brain regions and the corresponding motor behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{beta-amyloid (A beta) plaques and tau-related neurodegeneration are
   pathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The utility of AD
   biomarkers, including those measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), in
   predicting future AD risk and cognitive decline is still being refined.
   Here, we explored potential relationships between functional
   connectivity (FC) patterns within the default-mode network (DMN), age,
   CSF biomarkers (A beta(42) and pTau(181)), and cognitive status in older
   adults. Multiple measures of FC were explored, including a novel time
   series-based measure {[}total interdependence (TI)]. In our sample of 27
   cognitively normal older adults, no significant associations were found
   between levels of A beta(42) or pTau181 and cognitive scores or regional
   brain volumes. However, we observed several novel relationships between
   these biomarkers and measures of FC in DMN during both resting-state and
   a short-term memory task. First, increased connectivity betweenbilateral
   anterior middle temporal gyri was associated with higher levels of CSF A
   beta(42) and A beta(42)/pTau(181) ratio (reflecting lower AD risk)
   during both rest and task. Second, increased bilateral parietal
   connectivity during the short-term memory task, but not during rest, was
   associated with higher levels of CSF pTau(181) (reflecting higher AD
   risk). Third, increased connectivity between left middle temporal and
   left parietal cortices during the active task was associated with
   decreased global cognitive status but not CSF biomarkers. Lastly, we
   found that our new TI method was more sensitive to the CSF A
   beta(42)-connectivity relationship whereas the traditional
   cross-correlation method was more sensitive to levels of CSF pTau(181)
   and cognitive status. With further refinement, resting-state
   connectivity and task-driven connectivity measures hold promise as
   non-invasive neuroimaging markers of A beta and pTau burden in
   cognitively normal older adults.}},

Abstract = {{Current velocity and hydrographic measurements were obtained in Mossoro
   estuary, a tropical semiarid estuary in Northeastern Brazil, to explore
   the hydrodynamic regime associated with marked seasonal variability in
   evaporation and precipitation. Measurement campaigns were performed
   during dry conditions in October 2012 and wet conditions in May 2013.
   Dry season observations showed along-estuary density gradients of order
   0.001 kg/m(4) with salinity increasing upstream in the first 20 km up to
   a value of 70 g/kg. Salinity then decreased to a value of 48 g/kg at the
   upstream limit of the section. During this dry season, the residual flow
   structure changed drastically from spring to neap tides. Neap tide
   residual flows showed inflow of oceanic water at the surface and outflow
   of hypersaline water underneath. Spring tide residual flows showed net
   inflow throughout the water column in the middle of the section and
   outflow over the flanks, a laterally sheared structure consistent with
   tidally induced residual flows. In the wet season, along-estuary density
   gradients were of similar magnitude to the dry season but in the
   opposite direction. Residual flows in neap tides were as expected for
   density-driven flows: outflow at surface and inflow underneath. During
   spring tides, residual flows were dominated by outflows over the flanks
   and inflow in the middle of the section, once again consistent with
   tidally driven residuals. Advective accelerations from tides were
   compared to baroclinic pressure gradients, in the non dimensional tidal
   Froude number (Fr-0), to explore the changes from tidally driven to
   density-driven residual flows. Results indicated that residual flows in
   this estuary were driven by tidal rectification (Fro 1) in spring tides
   and by density-gradients (Fr-0 << 1) in neap tides. Thus, estuarine
   residual flows switch from density-driven in neaps to tidally driven in
   springs. In general, it is proposed that the switch can be diagnosed
   with Fr-0. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Thioredoxins (Trx) play central roles in cellular redox regulation.
   Although hundreds of Trx targets have been identified using different
   approaches, the capture of targets in a quantitative and efficient
   manner is challenging. Here we report a high-throughput method using
   cysteine reactive tandem mass tag (cysTMT) labeling followed by liquid
   chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS) to screen for Trx targets.
   Compared to existing methods, this approach allows for i) three
   replicates of pairwise comparison in a single LC-MS run to reduce
   run-to-run variation; ii) efficient enrichment of cysteine-containing
   peptides that requires low protein input; and iii) accurate
   quantification of the cysteine redox status and localization of the Trx
   targeted cysteine residues. Application of this method in guard
   cell-enriched epidermal peels from Brassica napus revealed 80 Trx h
   targets involved in a broad range of processes, including
   photosynthesis, stress response, metabolism and cell signaling. The
   adaption of this protocol in other systems will greatly improve our
   understanding of the Trx function in regulating cellular redox
   homeostasis.
   Biological significance: Redox homeostasis is tightly regulated for
   proper cellular activities. Specific protein-protein interactions
   between redox active molecules such as thioredoxin (Trx) and target
   proteins constitute the basis for redox-regulated biological processes.
   The use of cysTMT quantitative proteomics for studying Trx reactions
   enabled identification of potential Trx targets that provide important
   insights into the redox regulation in guard cells, a specialized plant
   cell type responsible for sensing of environmental signals, gas exchange
   and plant productivity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Photoluminescent silicon nanocrystals are very attractive for biomedical
   and electronic applications. Here a new process is presented to
   synthesize photoluminescent silicon nanocrystals with diameters smaller
   than 6 nm from a porous silicon template. These nanoparticles are formed
   using a pore-wall thinning approach, where the as-etched porous silicon
   layer is partially oxidized to silica, which is dissolved by a
   hydrofluoric acid solution, decreasing the pore-wall thickness. This
   decrease in pore-wall thickness leads to a corresponding decrease in the
   size of the nanocrystals that make up the pore walls, resulting in the
   formation of smaller nanoparticles during sonication of the porous
   silicon. Particle diameters were measured using dynamic light
   scattering, and these values were compared with the nanocrystallite size
   within the pore wall as determined from X-ray diffraction. Additionally,
   an increase in the quantum confinement effect is observed for these
   particles through an increase in the photoluminescence intensity of the
   nanoparticles compared with the as-etched nanoparticles, without the
   need for a further activation step by oxidation after synthesis.}},

Abstract = {{During the last two decades the world is being transformed towards a
   virtual agglomerate of large interconnected cities. Moreover, an
   integration of digital infrastructures with the physical city
   infrastructure and facilities is taking place. This integration includes
   data generating sensors and various internet-connected devices which are
   dispersed in a city having as a target to offer a variety of services in
   order to ease citizens' daily lives. In this, so called, smart city
   digital ecosystem, companies provide eBusiness models that are based on
   Collective Intelligence based decision making applications focusing on
   discovering citizens' needs by collecting data related to their
   activities. However, the lack of privacy preserving mechanisms in such
   applications that eliminate the risk of correlation between citizens'
   activities and their identities discourages citizens from providing
   their data to commerce systems. In this paper, we first discuss a new
   privacy preserving authentication technology, the Privacy-ABCs, and its
   successful deployment in a course evaluation pilot in higher education
   as well as a social networking application for pupils in a school
   environment. Based on the wide acceptance of this technology by the
   pilot users, we propose the deployment of a Privacy-ABCs based
   authentication system in a generic Collective Intelligent eBusiness
   model in a Smart City. The incorporation of this authentication
   technology in Collective Intelligence based eServices, has the potential
   of establishing new market opportunities since citizens' anonymity will
   increase their incentives to provide valuable data related to their
   consuming activities and buying preferences as they move about in the
   city.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates a scheduling model with certain co-existing
   features of serial-batching, dynamic job arrival, multi-types of job,
   and setup time. In this proposed model, the jobs of all types are first
   partitioned into serial batches, which are then processed on a single
   serial-batching machine with an independent constant setup time for each
   new batch. In order to solve this scheduling problem, we divide it into
   two phases based on job arrival times, and we also derive and prove
   certain constructive properties for these two phases. Relying on these
   properties, we develop a two-phase hybrid algorithm (TPHA). In addition,
   a valid lower bound of the problem is also derived. This is used to
   validate the quality of the proposed algorithm. Computational
   experiments, both with small- and large-scale problems, are performed in
   order to evaluate the performance of TPHA. The computational results
   indicate that TPHA outperforms seven other heuristic algorithms. For all
   test problems of different job sizes, the average gap percentage between
   the makespan, obtained using TPHA, and the lower bound does not exceed
   5.41 \%.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: There is an urgent need for simple, inexpensive, noninvasive,
   and repeatable technique for the diagnosis of pulmonary diseases.
   Bronchoalveolar lavage, which is the gold standard diagnostic method for
   pulmonary diseases, does not meet any of these criteria. This study
   seeks to develop and optimize a novel technique of Internal Airway
   Percussion (IAP) to facilitate the collection and characterization of
   human respiratory system exhalates. Methods: The IAP device transmits
   sound waves into the respiratory tract, thereby increasing the release
   of aerosolized particles within exhaled breath by vibrating both lungs.
   Nine combinations of sound wave frequencies and amplitudes were studied
   to determine optimal frequency and amplitude combination for maximum
   aerosol particle gain in healthy human subjects. Results: Square-shaped
   sound waves generated at 15Hz and 3cm H2O resulted in 15 times greater
   total mass of collected particles in the first 2min of sampling, and 1.2
   to 1.5 times increase in count median diameter of the particles.
   Conclusions: IAP, optimized at the frequency of 15Hz and the pressure
   amplitude of 3cm H2O, increased the total mass of particles exhaled from
   the human respiratory system. IAP has a broad range of potential
   clinical applications for noninvasive diagnosis of lung diseases
   including asthma, cystic fibrosis, pneumonia, and lung cancer, along
   with improvement of mucus clearance.}},

Title = {{Parameterization of photon beam dosimetry for a linear accelerator}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{748-760}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: In radiation therapy, accurate data acquisition of photon beam
   dosimetric quantities is important for (1) beam modeling data input into
   a treatment planning system (TPS), (2) comparing measured and TPS
   modeled data, (3) the quality assurance process of a linear
   accelerator's (Linac) beam characteristics, (4) the establishment of a
   standard data set for comparison with other data, etcetera.
   Parameterization of the photon beam dosimetry creates a data set that is
   portable and easy to implement for different applications such as those
   previously mentioned. The aim of this study is to develop methods to
   parameterize photon beam dosimetric quantities, including percentage
   depth doses (PDDs), profiles, and total scatter output factors (Scp).
   Methods: Scp, PDDs, and profiles for different field sizes, depths, and
   energies were measured for a Linac using a cylindrical 3D water scanning
   system. All data were smoothed for the analysis and profile data were
   also centered, symmetrized, and geometrically scaled. The Scp data were
   analyzed using an exponential function. The inverse square factor was
   removed from the PDD data before modeling and the data were subsequently
   analyzed using exponential functions. For profile modeling, one halfside
   of the profile was divided into three regions described by exponential,
   sigmoid, and Gaussian equations. All of the analytical functions are
   field size, energy, depth, and, in the case of profiles, scan direction
   specific. The model's parameters were determined using the minimal
   amount of measured data necessary. The model's accuracy was evaluated
   via the calculation of absolute differences between the measured
   (processed) and calculated data in low gradient regions and
   distance-to-agreement analysis in high gradient regions. Finally, the
   results of dosimetric quantities obtained by the fitted models for a
   different machine were also assessed.
   Results: All of the differences in the PDDs' buildup and the profiles'
   penumbra regions were less than 2 and 0.5 mm, respectively. The
   differences in the low gradient regions were 0.20\% 0.20\% (<1\% for
   all) and 0.50\% 0.35\% (<1\% for all) for PDDs and profiles,
   respectively. For Scp data, all of the absolute differences were less
   than 0.5\%.
   Conclusions: This novel analytical model with minimum measurement
   requirements was proved to accurately calculate PDDs, profiles, and Scp
   for different field sizes, depths, and energies. (C) 2016 American

Title = {{Tree Species Abundance Predictions in a Tropical Agricultural Landscape
   with a Supervised Classification Model and Imbalanced Data}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Mapping species through classification of imaging spectroscopy data is
   facilitating research to understand tree species distributions at
   increasingly greater spatial scales. Classification requires a dataset
   of field observations matched to the image, which will often reflect
   natural species distributions, resulting in an imbalanced dataset with
   many samples for common species and few samples for less common species.
   Despite the high prevalence of imbalanced datasets in multiclass species
   predictions, the effect on species prediction accuracy and landscape
   species abundance has not yet been quantified. First, we trained and
   assessed the accuracy of a support vector machine (SVM) model with a
   highly imbalanced dataset of 20 tropical species and one mixed-species
   class of 24 species identified in a hyperspectral image mosaic (350-2500
   nm) of Panamanian farmland and secondary forest fragments. The model,
   with an overall accuracy of 62\% +/- 2.3\% and F-score of 59\% +/-
   2.7\%, was applied to the full image mosaic (23,000 ha at a 2-m
   resolution) to produce a species prediction map, which suggested that
   this tropical agricultural landscape is more diverse than what has been
   presented in field-based studies. Second, we quantified the effect of
   class imbalance on model accuracy. Model assessment showed a trend where
   species with more samples were consistently over predicted while species
   with fewer samples were under predicted. Standardizing sample size
   reduced model accuracy, but also reduced the level of species over- and
   under-prediction. This study advances operational species mapping of
   diverse tropical landscapes by detailing the effect of imbalanced data
   on classification accuracy and providing estimates of tree species
   abundance in an agricultural landscape. Species maps using data and
   methods presented here can be used in landscape analyses of species
   distributions to understand human or environmental effects, in addition
   to focusing conservation efforts in areas with high tree cover and
   diversity.}},

Abstract = {{In covert visual attention, frontoparietal attention control areas are
   thought to issue signals to selectively bias sensory neurons to
   facilitate behaviorally relevant information and suppress distraction.
   We investigated the relationship between activity in attention control
   areas and attention-related modulation of posterior alpha activity using
   simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging in humans during cued visual-spatial attention.
   Correlating single-trial EEG alpha power with blood-oxygen-level
   dependent (BOLD) activity, we found that BOLD in the intraparietal
   sulcus (IPS) and left middle frontal gyrus was inversely correlated with
   occipital alpha power. Importantly, in IPS, inverse correlations were
   stronger for alpha within the hemisphere contralateral to the attended
   hemifield, implicating the IPS in the enhancement of task-relevant
   sensory areas. Positive BOLD-alpha correlations were observed in
   sensorimotor cortices and the default mode network, suggesting a
   mechanism of active suppression over task-irrelevant areas. The
   magnitude of cue-induced alpha lateralization was positively correlated
   with BOLD in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex, implicating a role of executive control in attention.
   These results show that IPS and frontal executive areas are the main
   sources of biasing influences on task-relevant visual cortex, whereas
   task-irrelevant default mode network and sensorimotor cortex are
   inhibited during visual attention.}},

Title = {{Computational simulation of platelet interactions in the initiation of
   stent thrombosis due to stent malapposition}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Coronary stenting is one of the most commonly used approaches to open
   coronary arteries blocked due to atherosclerosis. Stent malapposition
   can induce thrombosis but the microscopic process is poorly understood.
   The objective of this study was to determine the platelet-level process
   by which different extents of stent malapposition affect the initiation
   of stent thrombosis. We utilized a discrete element model to
   computationally simulate the transport, adhesion, and activation of
   thousands of individual platelets and red blood cells during thrombus
   initiation in stented coronary arteries. Simulated arteries contained a
   malapposed stent with a specified gap distance (0, 10, 25, 50, or 200 mu
   m) between the struts and endothelium. Platelet-level details of
   thrombus formation near the proximal-most strut were measured during the
   simulations. The relationship between gap distance and amount of
   thrombus in the artery varied depending on different conditions (e.g.,
   amount of dysfunctional endothelium, shear-induced activation of
   platelets, and thrombogenicity of the strut). Without considering
   shear-induced platelet activation, the largest gap distance (200 mu m)
   produced no recirculation and less thrombus than the smallest two gap
   distances (0 and 10 mu m) that created recirculation downstream of the
   strut. However, with the occurrence of shear-induced platelet
   activation, the largest gap distance produced more thrombus than the two
   smallest gap distances, but less thrombus than an intermediate gap
   distance (25 mu m). A large gap distance was not necessarily the most
   thrombogenic, in contrast to implications of some computational fluid

Abstract = {{Methanol catalytic combustion in a mini-scale tubular quartz-made
   combustor is investigated in this study. An alumina sphere was employed
   as the support for the platinum catalyst. The experimental results
   showed that the combustion can be self-ignited at room temperature.
   Using the combustor wall temperature to characterize the combustor
   performance, it was found that the combustion temperature can reach a
   high value within a short time. The experimental results indicated that
   the combustor performance depends greatly on the fuel/air supply. A
   higher temperature can be obtained with a higher fuel/air flow rate. The
   insulated and non-insulated combustor experimental results indicated
   that heat loss to the environment is an important factor in governing
   the combustion characteristics due to the large surface/volume ratio. A
   higher temperature can also be obtained when the combustor is insulated.
   Because most of the combustion took place at the combustor entrance
   region, the experimental result suggested that the combustor length can
   be shortened, leading to a more compact design allowing the combustor
   integration with various applications. A simple numerical model was
   built to provide a greater understanding of the combustion
   characteristics and examine the heat loss effect on combustor
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Cytoskeletal forces are transmitted to the nucleus to position and shape

   Nuclear position and shape can be thought to be determined by a balance
   of cytoskeletal forces generated by microtubule motors that shear the
   nuclear surface, actomyosin forces that can pull, push and shear the
   nucleus, and intermediate filaments that may passively resist nuclear
   decentering and deformation. Parsing contributions of these different
   forces to nuclear mechanics is a very challenging task. Here we review
   new approaches that can be used in living cells to probe and understand

Abstract = {{Most existing research adopts a ``flat{''} view of radio frequency
   identification (RFID) systems to perform various functions of collecting
   tag IDs, estimating the number of tags, detecting the missing tags, etc.
   However, in practice, tags are often attached to objects of different
   groups, which may represent different product types in a warehouse,
   different book categories in a library, etc. As we move from a flat view
   to an organized group view, there arise many interesting problems. One
   of them, called multigroup threshold-based classification, is the focus
   of this paper. It is to determine whether the number of objects in each
   group is above or below a prescribed threshold value. Solving this
   problem is important for inventory tracking applications. If the number
   of groups is very large, it will be inefficient to measure the groups
   one at a time. The best existing solution for multigroup threshold-based
   classification is based on generic group testing, whose design is
   however geared toward detecting a small number of populous groups. Its
   performance degrades quickly when the number of groups above the
   threshold becomes large. In this paper, we propose a new classification
   protocol based on tag sampling and logical bitmaps. It achieves high
   efficiency by measuring all groups in a mixed fashion. In the meantime,
   we show that the new method is able to perform threshold-based
   classification with an accuracy that can be preset to any desirable
   level, allowing tradeoff between time efficiency and accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{This work focuses on analyses of cooperative protocols to enhance the
   performance of power line communication systems. Based on a measurement
   campaign and considering a sum power constraint, achievable data rates
   for amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) protocols are
   analyzed. Similar investigations are performed for the maximum data
   rates attained using Hermitian-symmetric orthogonal frequency division
   multiplexing (HS-OFDM) together with equal gain combining (EGC),
   selection combining (SC) and maximal ratio combining (MRC) techniques.
   The influences of optimally and uniformly allocated transmission power
   and frequency bandwidth are are also analyzed and the efficiency of
   combination before and after equalization is compared. Results show that
   the relative distances among source, relay and destination nodes
   significantly impact system performance. Also, they reveal a range of
   total transmission power and bandwidth in which benefits can be
   verified. Among combining techniques, MRC and SC present similar
   results, but MRC offers a slightly better performance. In relation to
   computational complexity, SC is the most favorable. Maximum data rate
   analyses of HS-OFDM with frequency domain equalization based on zero
   forcing and minimum mean square error criteria show that the former
   scheme offers almost the same performance as the latter. Furthermore, it
   is shown that equalization after combination is more advantageous.}},

Abstract = {{Computer-aided image analysis of histopathology specimens could
   potentially provide support for early detection and improved
   characterization of diseases such as brain tumor, pancreatic
   neuroendocrine tumor (NET), and breast cancer. Automated nucleus
   segmentation is a prerequisite for various quantitative analyses
   including automatic morphological feature computation. However, it
   remains to be a challenging problem due to the complex nature of
   histopathology images. In this paper, we propose a learning-based
   framework for robust and automatic nucleus segmentation with shape
   preservation. Given a nucleus image, it begins with a deep convolutional
   neural network (CNN) model to generate a probability map, on which an
   iterative region merging approach is performed for shape
   initializations. Next, a novel segmentation algorithm is exploited to
   separate individual nuclei combining a robust selection-based sparse
   shape model and a local repulsive deformable model. One of the
   significant benefits of the proposed framework is that it is applicable
   to different staining histopathology images. Due to the feature learning
   characteristic of the deep CNN and the high level shape prior modeling,
   the proposed method is general enough to perform well across multiple
   scenarios. We have tested the proposed algorithm on three large-scale
   pathology image datasets using a range of different tissue and stain
   preparations, and the comparative experiments with recent state of the
   arts demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Landfill disposal of municipal solidwaste represents one of the largest
   anthropogenic global methane emission sources(1), and recent policy
   approaches have targeted significant reductions of these emissions to
   combat climate change in the US (ref. 2). The efficacy of active gas
   collection systems in the US was examined by analysing performance data,
   including fire occurrence, from more than 850 landfills. A generalized
   linear model showed that the operating status of a landfill-open and
   actively receiving waste or closed-was the most significant predictor of
   collection system performance. Gas collection systems at closed
   landfills were statistically significantly more efficient (p < 0.001)
   and on average 17 percentage points more efficient than those at open
   landfills, but open landfills were found to represent 91\% of all
   landfill methane emissions. These results demonstrate the clear need to
   target open landfills to achieve significant near-term methane emission
   reductions. This observation is underscored by landfill disposal rates
   in the US significantly exceeding previously reported national
   estimates, with this study reporting 262 million tonnes in the year 2012
   compared with 122 million tonnes in 2012 as estimated by the US
   Environmental Protection Agency(3).}},

   through a concurrent atomistic-continuum modeling method. We make a
   first attempt to characterize the complexity of nonuniformly moving
   dislocations in anisotropic crystals from atomistic to microscale,
   including the energy intensities as well as the wavelengths of acoustic
   phonons emitted from sonic dislocations, and the velocity-dependent
   stress fluctuations around the core of nonuniformly moving dislocations.
   Instantaneous dislocation velocities and phonon drag effects on the
   dislocation motions are quantified and analyzed. Mach cones in a
   V-shaped pattern of the phonon wave-fronts are observed in the wake of
   the sonic dislocations. Analysis of simulation results based on a
   wavelet transform show that the faster a dislocation is moving, the
   longer the emitted phonon wavelength. The dislocation velocity drops
   dramatically with the occurrence of the interactions between
   dislocations and phonon waves reflected from the boundaries of
   specimens. The concurrent atomistic-continuum modeling framework is
   demonstrated to be the first multiscale method that explicitly treats
   the strong coupling between the long-range elastic fields away from the
   dislocation core, the highly nonlinear time-dependent stress field
   within the core, and the evolutions of the atomic scale dislocation core
   structures. As such, it is shown that this method is capable in
   predicting elastodynamics of dislocations in the presence of inertia
   effects associated with sonic dislocations in micron sized anisotropic
   crystalline materials from the atomic level, which is not directly
   accessible to the recent elastodynamic discrete dislocation model. (C)

Abstract = {{Conventional single tensor diffusion analysis models have provided mixed
   findings in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease, but recent work
   using a bi-tensor analysis model has shown more promising results. Using
   a bi-tensor model, free-water values were found to be increased in the
   posterior substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease compared with controls
   at a single site and in a multi-site cohort. Further, free-water
   increased longitudinally over 1 year in the posterior substantia nigra
   of Parkinson's disease. Here, we test the hypothesis that other
   parkinsonian disorders such as multiple system atrophy and progressive
   supranuclear palsy have elevated free-water in the substantia nigra.
   Equally important, however, is whether the bi-tensor diffusion model is
   able to detect alterations in other brain regions beyond the substantia
   nigra in Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, and progressive
   supranuclear palsy and to accurately distinguish between these diseases.
   Free-water and free-water-corrected fractional anisotropy maps were
   compared across 72 individuals in the basal ganglia, midbrain, thalamus,
   dentate nucleus, cerebellar peduncles, cerebellar vermis and lobules V
   and VI, and corpus callosum. Compared with controls, free-water was
   increased in the anterior and posterior substantia nigra of Parkinson's
   disease, multiple system atrophy, and progressive supranuclear palsy.
   Despite no other changes in Parkinson's disease, we observed elevated
   free-water in all regions except the dentate nucleus, subthalamic
   nucleus, and corpus callosum of multiple system atrophy, and in all
   regions examined for progressive supranuclear palsy. Compared with
   controls, free-water-corrected fractional anisotropy values were
   increased for multiple system atrophy in the putamen and caudate, and
   increased for progressive supranuclear palsy in the putamen, caudate,
   thalamus, and vermis, and decreased in the superior cerebellar peduncle
   and corpus callosum. For all disease group comparisons, the support
   vector machine 10-fold cross-validation area under the curve was between
   0.93-1.00 and there was high sensitivity and specificity. The regions
   and diffusion measures selected by the model varied across comparisons
   and are consistent with pathological studies. In conclusion, the current
   study used a novel bi-tensor diffusion analysis model to indicate that
   all forms of parkinsonism had elevated free-water in the substantia
   nigra. Beyond the substantia nigra, both multiple system atrophy and
   progressive supranuclear palsy, but not Parkinson's disease, showed a
   broad network of elevated free-water and altered free-water corrected
   fractional anisotropy that included the basal ganglia, thalamus, and
   cerebellum. These findings may be helpful in the differential diagnosis
   of parkinsonian disorders, and thereby facilitate the development and
   assessment of targeted therapies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a 50 nW wirelessly powered implant for the
   noninvasive monitoring of a bioartificial pancreas postimplantation in
   nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) animal studies. The proposed implant
   increases NMR signal sensitivity across a 190-470 MHz frequency range in
   both 4.7 and 11.1 T magnetic fields through the use of a wirelessly
   programmable resonator. An integrated split capacitive array provides
   51.8 pF tuning range and 52 fF resolution while maintaining resonant Q
   and reducing parasitic contributions. The implant supports forward data
   telemetry at 5-250 kbit/s using an envelope detector front-end and a 2.4
   MHz oversampling clock/data recovery (CDR) receiver. An integrated
   logic-controlled RF-DC converter and strongly coupled resonant wireless
   link provide sustained reliable energy transfer during NMR acquisition.
   NMR signal isolation from the wireless power transmissions is achieved
   through frequency allocation and orthogonally embedded coil design that
   provides increased mechanical strength for incorporating device
   components. Experimental results in tissue-equivalent gel phantoms and
   small animal studies show an increase in acquired signal-to-noise ratio
   (SNR) by 141\% (7.7 dB) and 83\% (5.3 dB) within 4.7 and 11.1 T magnetic
   field strengths, respectively, with an approximate 100\% (6 dB) increase
   in SNR within the region of interest (ROI) at higher image resolutions.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper serves to demonstrate resonant inductive coupling-based eddy
   current sensing as a promising piston position sensing mechanism for
   large vertical displacement micromirrors that exhibit piston scan ranges
   above 100 mu m. The sensor consists of two microfabricated coils
   packaged underneath the mirror plate of an electrothermally actuated
   piston scanning micromirror. For this paper, position sensing is
   achieved through the amplitude detection of the sensor oscillation
   signal due to the change in inductive coupling between the coils when
   the mirror plate undergoes its piston scan. Two sensing regions could be
   obtained: a front slope region that has a larger piston sensing range of
   similar to 1 mm with a 280-nm resolution and a back slope region that
   has higher sensitivity over a smaller piston sensing range of similar to
   130 mu m with a 20-nm resolution. For demonstration purpose, the sensing
   coils are designed to oscillate at 9.4 MHz through a regenerative
   circuit and a readout circuit was used to extract the piston position
   information, with which the static, dynamic, and frequency response of
   the micromirror were measured. This paper also presents the fundamental
   electromagnetic analytical modeling for the sensor performance.

Abstract = {{The effects of strong metal support interactions (SMSI) on the pairwise
   selectivity of propene hydrogenation over metal-oxide-supported Ir
   nanoparticles were investigated using parahydrogen-enhanced NMR
   spectroscopy. A similar to 20-fold increase in the pairwise selectivity
   was observed following a reduction treatment of the Ir/TiO2 catalyst at
   500 degrees C. Consistent with SMSI, the effects could be completely
   reversed by oxidation followed by rereduction at 200 degrees C.
   Noninteracting supports, such as Al2O3 and SiO2, did not show this
   behavior. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals partial reduction of
   the TiO2 support, and STEM data reveal flattening of Ir particles after
   high-temperature reduction. The presence of chloride ions during
   activation was found to further promote pairwise selectivity but only
   for the Ir/TiO2 catalyst. The results are interpreted in terms of the
   electronic and possible geometric blocking effects associated with SMSI.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BRIDGE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Specifications used in the design of bridges that cross barge-navigable
   waterways typically use, as a subcomponent of the impact-load
   calculation process, a barge force-deformation (crush) relationship.
   Such relationships model the nonlinear stiffness of the impacting barge
   and directly influence computed impact forces. Primarily because of
   logistical challenges, few studies have been conducted to experimentally
   quantify barge force-deformation data. A variety of analytical studies
   have been conducted to partially address this lack of experimental data,
   and to facilitate development of improved crush relationships. However,
   there remains a need for experimental data to validate analytically
   derived crush relationships, particularly at high barge-deformation
   levels. In this paper, an integrated experimental and analytical
   investigation of barge force-deformation behavior under high-energy
   impact loading is presented. Results from impact tests involving
   reduced-scale replicates of jumbo-hopper barge bows and impactors with
   two distinct surface geometries (e.g., circular and rectangular) are
   reported. Measured force and deformation data confirm several key
   findings previously identified through numerical simulation; for
   example, that rounded bridge surfaces produce smaller impact forces than
   flat (i.e., rectangular) surfaces. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil

Title = {{Bond Durability Factor for Externally Bonded CFRP Systems in Concrete
   Structures}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPOSITES FOR CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Lack of understanding and confidence in the long-term performance of
   externally bonded fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites in concrete
   structures still inhibits their application in repair of aged
   structures. While synergistic effects of multiple exposure conditions
   can be severe, it is generally agreed that the single most significant
   issue with externally bonded FRP composites is their susceptibility to
   degradation when exposed to moisture. This research utilized small-beam
   three-point bending test specimens to study FRP-concrete bond
   performance when subjected to accelerated conditioning environments
   (immersion in water and exposure to high humidity at elevated
   temperatures). Bond strength retention (Rb) was determined by dividing
   the conditioned strength by the average control strength. Test results
   from the present research were combined with other test data to form a
   database of over 700 test results. By utilizing an apparent analogy of
   FRP-concrete bonded systems to adhesive anchors, a bond durability
   factor (BDF) that quantifies loss in bond capacity due to accelerated
   conditioning is determined equivalently as a characteristic test value
   for adhesive anchors. Given their resistance to the environment, only
   carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites were examined. For the
   purpose of the analyses, and based on available data, it was determined
   that all CFRP systems may be split into three categories: wet-layup
   without putty, wet-layup with putty, and precured laminate. BDF
   corresponding to wet-layup without putty was determined to be 0.60. BDF
   for wet-layup with putty was not established due to the observed
   sensitivity to increasing conditioning temperature. CFRP laminate
   specimens failed prematurely by composite rupture or at the
   adhesive-composite interface; BDF was not determined as long term
   durability data corresponding to FRP-concrete bond failure mode was not
   available. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{An extended Mohr-Coulomb model is proposed to represent the
   pressure-dependent strength of intact structural ceramics under
   quasi-static and dynamic loading rates at high pressures. A plot of
   normalized shear stress versus hydrostatic pressure for a range of
   structural ceramics revealed that despite the differences in material
   properties, test methods, and strain rates, the failure strength data
   fall in a narrow range, which can be represented by a unified model. The
   overall deformation behavior of structural ceramics and their strain
   rate dependence of strength in multiaxial loading at high pressure
   beyond Hugoniot elastic limit (HEL) can be explained by an exponential
   pressure dependence in the Mohr-Coulomb model. The analysis also
   suggests that the influence of strain rate on strength of a ceramic
   diminishes with increase in confinement pressure.}},

   phase using humics-modified silica gel}},

Abstract = {{The objective was to estimate suitability of humics-modified silica gels
   for adsorptive removal of the Direct Brown 1 trisazo dye from aqueous
   phase. The major advantage of the proposed adsorbents is that of an
   ecologically sound procedure of immobilizing silanized humic derivatives
   onto silica gel in aquatic solutions. The silanized humic derivatives,
   in turn, are obtained without a use of organic solvent by reacting
   natural humic materials from peat and coal with
   3-aminopropyltriethoxyorganosilane in water. These silanized derivatives
   are surface active and are capable of self assembling into humic
   adlayers at the water solid interface. A use of this approach allows for
   immobilization of up to 220 mg of humic materials per 1 g of SiO2. The
   adsorption capacity of humics-modified silica gels with respect to the
   Direct Brown 1 trisazo dye varied from 3.5 up to 8.8 mg per 1 g of SiO2.
   The maximum sorption obtained for the silanized derivative with 50\%
   modification degree was comparable to adsorption capacity of activated
   coal to this dye (7.5 mg g(-1)). The results of this adsorption study,
   warrant further studies of azo dye removal from aqueous environments.

Title = {{An Open-Source Toolbox for Surrogate Modeling of Joint Contact Mechanics}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{269-277}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Goal: Incorporation of elastic joint contact models into simulations of
   human movement could facilitate studying the interactions between
   muscles, ligaments, and bones. Unfortunately, elastic joint
   contactmodels are often too expensive computationally to be used within
   iterative simulation frameworks. This limitation can be overcome by
   using fast and accurate surrogate contact models that fit or interpolate
   input-output data sampled from existing elastic contact models. However,
   construction of surrogate contact models remains an arduous task. The
   aim of this paper is to introduce an open-source program called
   Surrogate Contact Modeling Toolbox (SCMT) that facilitates surrogate
   contact model creation, evaluation, and use. Methods: SCMT interacts
   with the third-party software FEBio to perform elastic contact analyses
   of finite-element models and uses MATLAB to train neural networks that
   fit the input-output contact data. SCMT features sample point generation
   for multiple domains, automated sampling, sample point filtering, and
   surrogatemodel training and testing. Results: An overview of the
   software is presented along with two example applications. The first
   example demonstrates creation of surrogate contact models of artificial
   tibiofemoral and patellofemoral joints and evaluates their computational
   speed and accuracy, while the second demonstrates the use of surrogate
   contact models in a forward dynamic simulation of an open-chain leg
   extension-flexion motion. Conclusion: SCMT facilitates the creation of
   computationally fast and accurate surrogate contact models.
   Additionally, it serves as a bridge between FEBio and OpenSim
   musculoskeletal modeling software. Significance: Researchers may now
   create and deploy surrogate models of elastic joint contact with minimal
   effort.}},

Abstract = {{Reinforcement learning (RL)-based online approximate optimal control
   methods applied to deterministic systems typically require a restrictive
   persistence of excitation (PE) condition for convergence. This paper
   develops a concurrent learning (CL)-based implementation of model-based
   RL to solve approximate optimal regulation problems online under a
   PE-like rank condition. The development is based on the observation
   that, given a model of the system, RL can be implemented by evaluating
   the Bellman error at any number of desired points in the state space. In
   this result, a parametric system model is considered, and a CL-based
   parameter identifier is developed to compensate for uncertainty in the
   parameters. Uniformly ultimately bounded regulation of the system states
   to a neighborhood of the origin, and convergence of the developed policy
   to a neighborhood of the optimal policy are established using a
   Lyapunov-based analysis, and simulation results are presented to
   demonstrate the performance of the developed controller. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A new variant of multi-depot vehicle routing problem with time windows
   is studied. In the new variant, the depot where the vehicle ends is
   flexible, namely, it is not entirely the same as the depot that it
   starts from. An integer programming model is formulated with the minimum
   total traveling cost under the constrains of time window, capacity and
   route duration of the vehicle, the fleet size and the number of parking
   spaces of each depot. As the problem is an NP-Hard problem, a hybrid
   genetic algorithm with adaptive local search is proposed to solve it.
   Finally, the computational results show that the proposed method is
   competitive in terms of solution quality. Compared with the classic
   MDVRPTW, allowing flexible choice of the stop depot can further reduce
   total traveling cost.}},

Abstract = {{The sorption of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid
   (PFOA), and perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA) on granular activated carbon
   (GAC) was characterized and compared to explore the underlying
   mechanisms. Sorption of the three perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) on GAC
   appeared to be a rapid intra-particle diffusion process, which were well
   represented by the pseudo-second-order rate model with the sorption rate
   following the order PFOS > PFOA > PFHpA. Sorption isotherm data were
   well fitted by the Freundlich model with the sorption capacity (K-f) of
   PFOS, PFOA and PFHpA being 4.45, 2.42 and 1.66 respectively. This
   suggests that the hydrophilic head group on PFAAs, i.e. sulfonate vs
   carboxylic, has a strong influence on their sorption. Comparison between
   PFOA and PFHpA revealed that hydrophobicity could also play a role in
   the sorption of PFAAs on GAC when the fluorocarbon chain length is
   different. Analyses using Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR)-Fourier
   Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy suggested possible formation of a
   negative charge-assisted H-bond between PFAAs and the functionalities on
   GAC surfaces, including non-aromatic ketones, sulfides, and halogenated
   hydrocarbons. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study we successfully enhanced surface activity of natural humic
   substances (HS) with respect to mineral surfaces by functionalization
   with organosilanes. Of particular importance was that modification was
   conducted in water. Humates from coal and peat and
   3-aminopropyl-triethoxysilane (APTES) were used as starting materials.
   Atomic force microscopy showed silanized HS produced self-assembled
   adsorption monolayers at the water-solid interface. These adlayers
   caused an increase in the surface hydrophobicity with contact angles
   equaling 56 degrees. Application of silanized HS for treatment of
   different soil compartments including mineral soil separates and soil
   aggregates revealed an efficacy with respect to both re-assembly of soil
   aggregates and restoration of their water stability. Furthermore, field
   trials on the treatments of native sod-podzolic soil with silanized HS
   indicated improvements in soil structure as compared to non-treated soil
   or treatment with the non-functionalized humate. Results demonstrating
   the use of silanized HS as ecologically-safe, nature-inspired soil
   conditioners were promising. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Organic dyes used by food and textile industries, e.g. Malachite green
   dye (MG), contaminate surface and ground waters. Photocatalysis with
   ultraviolet light (UV) irradiation of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles can
   remove such industrial effluents. However, to more efficiently use solar
   energy, a photocatalyst active over a wider range of the visible light
   spectrum remains desirable for environmental remediation. Thus, we
   synthesized visible light photoactive cobalt/zinc oxide hollow sphere
   nanostructures with a hydrothermal process, and we used a number of
   characterization techniques to confirm that doped cobalt (Co) ions
   replace some zinc (Zn) ions in the lattice. The as-prepared Co doped
   hollow spheres performed 55.9 times better in Malachite green dye
   visible light photodegradation tests than similar ZnO nanoparticles.
   Furthermore, the Co/ZnO hollow spheres are recyclable. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The oxalate route offers a controlled approach to synthesize pure
   Ba1-xSrxTiO3 (BST) (0 <= x <= 1) nanopartides (phi approximate to 150 nm
   in diameter). Reduced BST dense nanoceramics were obtained by spark
   plasma sintering (SPS) and then annealed for a short time to reach
   colossal permittivity (is an element of'r = 10(5)) with low dielectric
   losses (tan delta = 0.03) at 1 kHz and 300 K. The effects of Ba-Sr
   substitution on structural, microstructural and electrical properties
   were analyzed. Comprehensive analysis of the electrical properties
   indicates that polaron hopping, mediated by Ti3+ ions and oxygen
   vacancies is the main contributing mechanism to colossal permittivity in
   Ba-rich BST compounds. Substitution of Ba by Sr reduced the contribution
   of polaron hopping and led to a decrease of real and imaginary parts of
   permittivity, while preserving interfacial polarization and yielding
   better temperature stability. The lowest temperature coefficient of
   capacitance, or TCC (variation of capacitance between 310K and 450 K)
   value, i.e., 44 ppm K-1, is obtained for SrTiO3. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Terrestrial and microgravity pool boiling generated from a platinum wire
   heater in the presence of an acoustic standing wave were performed using
   degassed FC-72 Fluorinert liquid. The sound wave was created by driving
   a half wavelength resonator at a frequency of 10.15 kHz. Microgravity
   conditions were created using the 2.1 second drop tower on the campus of
   Washington State University. Burnout of the heater wire, often
   encountered with heat flux controlled systems, was avoided by using a
   constant temperature controller to regulate the heater wire temperature.
   The amplitude of the acoustic standing wave was increased from 28 kPa to
   over 70 kPa and these pressure measurements were made using a hydrophone
   fabricated with a small piezoelectric ceramic. Cavitation incurred
   during experiments at higher acoustic amplitudes contributed to the
   vapor bubble dynamics and heat transfer. The heater wire was positioned
   at three different locations within the acoustic field: the acoustic
   node, antinode, and halfway between these locations. Complete boiling
   curves are presented to show how the applied acoustic field enhanced
   boiling heat transfer and increased critical heat flux in the
   terrestrial environment, while in microgravity the acoustic field was
   found to be capable of filling the role of terrestrial gravity in
   maintaining nucleate boiling. Video images provide information on the
   interaction between the vapor bubbles and the acoustic field. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{To enable efficient design and analysis of cryogenic propellant transfer
   systems, high accuracy models are required for predicting two phase flow
   boiling and heat transfer at reduced temperatures. The penalty for poor
   models translates into higher margin, safety factor, and ultimately cost
   in design. Recently, there has been a drive towards developing universal
   correlations to cover a broad range of fluids, tube diameters, and
   thermodynamic conditions for predicting heat flux and pressure drop.
   These correlations do not, however, cover cryogenic fluids like liquid
   hydrogen. Therefore the purpose of this paper is to apply popular two
   phase heat transfer correlations used in commercial codes against
   available flow boiling data for cryogenic fluids. Specifically,
   quenching test data for critical heat flux and two phase heat transfer
   coefficient are compared against the correlations. Results show that
   existing correlations over-predict heat transfer by as much as 20,000\%
   and that significant model improvements are warranted. Published by

Title = {{Relationship between mixed and pure gas self-diffusion for ethane and

   NMR}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{499}},

Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR was applied to study self-diffusion of
   an ethane/ethene mixture and the corresponding pure gases in a
   mixed-matrix membrane (MMM) formed by dispersing ZIF-8 particles in
   6FDA-DAM polymer. In addition to the MMM, diffusion measurements of the
   pure gases were also carried out for the membrane constituents, i.e.
   ZIF-8 particle bed and the pure polymer film. PFG NMR studies were
   performed at a high magnetic field of 17.6 T using large magnetic field
   gradients up to 30 T/m. The former allowed achieving sufficiently large
   signal-to-noise ratios, while the latter enabled diffusivity
   measurements to be performed for molecular displacements smaller than
   the size of ZIF-8 particles. As a result, the gas self-diffusivities for
   the diffusion inside the ZIF-8 particles dispersed in the MMM and for
   the diffusion inside the surrounding polymer matrix could be obtained
   separately. For each gas, the diffusivities inside the ZIF-8 and polymer
   phases of the MMM were found to be smaller than the corresponding
   diffusivities in the neat ZIF-8 particle bed and pure polymer film. This
   observation is explained by the reduced framework flexibility of ZIF-8
   and the polymer chain rigidification in the MMM. The ethane and ethene
   diffusivities in the MMM loaded with the ethane/ethene mixture were
   compared with the corresponding diffusivities in the MMM loaded with a
   single gas. It was found that the presence of another gas component in
   the ZIF-8 particles dispersed in the MMM does not change the
   self-diffusivity inside the particles for both gases. At the same time,
   the self-diffusivity of the faster-diffusing sorbate (ethene) in the
   polymer phase of the MMM was reduced by co-adsorption of the
   slower-diffusing sorbate (ethane) in the MMM. The analytical expression
   proposed in our previous work for the long-range diffusivity in MMMs was
   validated for gas mixtures and pure gases based on the experimental data
   reported in this work. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Applying the selective harmonic elimination (SHE) technique to
   grid-connected-cascaded modular multilevel inverters has been widely
   discussed in the literature. However, due to the difficulties of solving
   high-order nonlinear transcendental equations, the SHE technique cannot
   be implemented in real time so its applications are limited. This paper
   presents a technique to convert the nonlinear equations to a specific
   control system and use a look-up table, integral controllers and a
   decoupling controller to help the system converge to a zero-error steady
   state. An inner instantaneous observer is introduced to directly extract
   the harmonic spectrum of the output voltages without applying FFT
   algorithm to output step voltage waveforms. It can not only simplify
   software design but also eliminate the phase delay generated by
   conventional spectrum extracting algorithm. The proposed technique can
   achieve an accurate switching angle control and a fast response.
   Simulation and experimental results verified that the system can achieve
   zero-error steady state within one line period.}},

Abstract = {{We present a heat transfer model for energy transport in a solar
   thermochemical reactor for CO2 and/or H2O splitting to produce chemical
   fuels CO and/or H-2. The reactor is comprised of a horizontal
   cavity-receiver packed with several insulation layers, an array of
   tubular absorbers in which the reactive metal oxide is loaded, and a
   windowless aperture that allows the incident concentrated solar energy
   to enter the receiver. A framework for modeling the complex multimode
   thermal transport within the reactor system is developed. The
   concentrated solar radiation from a high flux solar simulator to the
   cavity-receiver is simulated using a Monte-Carlo ray tracing model. Heat
   transfer within the tubular absorbers, including conduction, convection,
   radiation, and chemical reactions, is simulated using a lattice
   Boltzmann (LB) model. These two models are coupled by taking into
   account the temperature-dependent radiative emission from the absorber
   surfaces. Two particular techniques are employed to improve the
   numerical accuracy and stability: appropriate rescaling of the
   relaxation coefficients in the LB method and implicit treatment of the
   heat source/sink terms due to chemical reactions. The numerical method
   is validated with two test cases for which analytical solutions are
   available. Simulation results for the heating process and one thermal
   reduction step under near-vacuum pressures are presented. The predicted
   solar-to-fuel energy conversion efficiency varies from 5\% to 10\% and
   is determined based on the simulated O-2 release during the reduction
   step. The model is able to provide insight into the optimum operating
   conditions, the reactor design and the scale-up. The results suggest
   that high temperatures for both reduction and oxidation steps and
   near-vacuum pressure (similar to 10(-4) atm) for thermal reduction are
   critical for improved solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency with the
   ceria-based reactive material. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy

Abstract = {{A crucial challenge in network theory is the study of the robustness of
   a network when facing a sequence of failures. In this work, we propose a
   dynamical definition of network robustness based on Information Theory,
   that considers measurements of the structural changes caused by failures
   of the network's components. Failures are defined here as a temporal
   process defined in a sequence. Robustness is then evaluated by measuring
   dissimilarities between topologies after each time step of the sequence,
   providing a dynamical information about the topological damage. We
   thoroughly analyze the efficiency of the method in capturing small
   perturbations by considering different probability distributions on
   networks. In particular, we find that distributions based on distances
   are more consistent in capturing network structural deviations, as
   better reflect the consequences of the failures. Theoretical examples
   and real networks are used to study the performance of this methodology.

Abstract = {{Time-correlated 1.54 mu s high-speed video frames, channel-base current
   and current derivative (dI/dt), and electric field derivative (dE/dt)
   measurements are used to analyze the attachment process of triggered
   lightning dart-stepped leaders. Lengths, speeds, and durations of the
   upward-connecting positive leaders propagating from the launching
   structure are measured and calculated. The leader burst occurring
   immediately preceding the dE/dt slow front is demonstrated to be a
   distinctly different process from the preceding downward dart-stepped
   leader steps and is associated with the fast increase in channel-base
   current due to the initial interactions of the downward and upward
   leader streamer zones. Locations of the leader burst pulses are found to
   occur within or immediately above the connection region. Pulses
   superimposed on the dE/dt slow front are shown to occur after the
   initial connection between the downward and upward leaders and are
   associated with kiloampere-scale increases in the channel-base current.
   Subsequent fast-transition pulses are found to produce multiple
   kiloampere-scale increases in the channel-base current. Observed time
   delays between dE/dt and dI/dt peaks for slow front and fast-transition
   pulses confirm the existence of an elevated junction point between the
   downward and upward leaders. Average downward current wave speeds for
   fast-transition pulses are found to be a factor of 2 to 2.5 faster than
   those for slow-front pulses. For 51 dart-stepped leader events, the
   average total duration of the attachment process, starting with the
   initial fast current increase and ending with the peak of the final
   dI/dt fast-transition pulse, is measured to be 1.77 mu s.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JAN 22}},
Abstract = {{Morphological variability in cytoskeletal organization, organelle
   position and cell boundaries is a common feature of cultured cells.
   Remarkable uniformity and reproducibility in structure can be
   accomplished by providing cells with defined geometric cues. Cells in
   tissues can also self-organize in the absence of directing extracellular
   cues; however the mechanical principles for such self-organization are
   not understood. We report that unlike horizontal shapes, the vertical
   shapes of the cell and nucleus in the z-dimension are uniform in cells
   in cultured monolayers compared to isolated cells. Apical surfaces of
   cells and their nuclei in monolayers were flat and heights were uniform.
   In contrast, isolated cells, or cells with disrupted cell-cell adhesions
   had nuclei with curved apical surfaces and variable heights. Isolated
   cells cultured within micron-sized square wells displayed flat cell and
   nuclear shapes similar to cells in monolayers. Local disruption of
   nuclear-cytoskeletal linkages resulted in spatial variation in vertical
   uniformity. These results suggest that competition between cell-cell
   pulling forces that expand and shorten the vertical cell cross-section,
   thereby widening and flattening the nucleus, and the resistance of the
   nucleus to further flattening results in uniform cell and nuclear
   cross-sections. Our results reveal the mechanical principles of
   self-organized vertical uniformity in cell monolayers.}},

Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{JAN 21}},
Abstract = {{Creating a hierarchical interface between the reinforcement and matrix
   phases of fiber reinforced polymer composites has become an effective
   strategy toward development of bioinspired structural composites. The
   resulting materials display exceptional characteristics such as having
   both high stiffness and high toughness simultaneously, which is rare in
   homogeneous materials. Although the efficacy of nanostructured
   interfaces has been established, the mechanisms associated with their
   performance have not been explored yet. Here, strain transfer across a
   nanowire interphase is visualized in order to understand the working
   principles of physical interface modifications. This is accomplished by
   using a functionally graded piezoelectric interface composed of
   nanowires, as their piezoelectric properties can be utilized to control
   the strain on one side of the interface. It is demonstrated that the
   nanowire ``whiskers{''} cause an even strain transfer from the
   reinforcement phase into the matrix phase, eliminating stress
   concentration between the phases.}},

Title = {{Top-Down Control of Visual Alpha Oscillations: Sources of Control
   Signals and Their Mechanisms of Action}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JAN 20}},
Abstract = {{Alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz) are thought to inversely correlate with
   cortical excitability. Goal-oriented modulation of alpha has been
   studied extensively. In visual spatial attention, alpha over the region
   of visual cortex corresponding to the attended location decreases,
   signifying increased excitability to facilitate the processing of
   impending stimuli. In contrast, in retention of verbal working memory,
   alpha over visual cortex increases, signifying decreased excitability to
   gate out stimulus input to protect the information held online from
   sensory interference. According to the prevailing model, this
   goal-oriented biasing of sensory cortex is effected by top-down control
   signals from frontal and parietal cortices. The present study tests and
   substantiates this hypothesis by (a) identifying the signals that
   mediate the top-down biasing influence, (b) examining whether the
   cortical areas issuing these signals are task specific or task
   independent, and (c) establishing the possible mechanism of the biasing
   action. High-density human EEG data were recorded in two experimental
   paradigms: a trial-by-trial cued visual spatial attention task and a
   modified Sternberg working memory task. Applying Granger causality to
   both sensor-level and source-level data we report the following
   findings. In covert visual spatial attention, the regions exerting
   top-down control over visual activity are lateralized to the right
   hemisphere, with the dipoles located at the right frontal eye field
   (FEF) and the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) being the main sources
   of top down influences. During retention of verbal working memory, the
   regions exerting top-down control over visual activity are lateralized
   to the left hemisphere, with the dipoles located at the left middle
   frontal gyrus (MFG) being the main source of top-down influences. In
   both experiments, top down influences are mediated by alpha
   oscillations, and the biasing effect is likely achieved via an
   inhibition-disinhibition mechanism.}},

Title = {{Assessing Granger Causality in Electrophysiological Data: Removing the
   Adverse Effects of Common Signals via Bipolar Derivations}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JAN 20}},
Abstract = {{Multielectrode voltage data are usually recorded against a common
   reference. Such data are frequently used without further treatment to
   assess patterns of functional connectivity between neuronal populations
   and between brain areas. It is important to note from the outset that
   such an approach is valid only when the reference electrode is nearly
   electrically silent. In practice, however, the reference electrode is
   generally not electrically silent, thereby adding a common signal to the
   recorded data. Volume conduction further complicates the problem. In
   this study we demonstrate the adverse effects of common signals on the
   estimation of Granger causality, which is a statistical measure used to
   infer synaptic transmission and information flow in neural circuits from
   multielectrode data. We further test the hypothesis that the problem can
   be overcome by utilizing bipolar derivations where the difference
   between two nearby electrodes is taken and treated as a representation
   of local neural activity. Simulated data generated by a neuronal network
   model where the connectivity pattern is known were considered first.
   This was followed by analyzing data from three experimental preparations
   where a priori predictions regarding the patterns of causal interactions
   can be made: (1) laminar recordings from the hippocampus of an
   anesthetized rat during theta rhythm, (2) laminar recordings from V4 of
   an awake-behaving macaque monkey during alpha rhythm, and (3) ECoG
   recordings from electrode arrays implanted in the middle temporal lobe
   and prefrontal cortex of an epilepsy patient during fixation. For both
   simulation and experimental analysis the results show that bipolar
   derivations yield the expected connectivity patterns whereas the
   untreated data (referred to as unipolar signals) do not In addition,
   current source density signals, where applicable, yield results that are
   close to the expected connectivity patterns, whereas the commonly
   practiced average re reference method leads to erroneous results.}},

Abstract = {{Deepwater Horizon was the largest marine oil spill in U.S. waters,
   oiling large expanses of coastal wetland shorelines. We compared marsh
   periwinkle (Littoraria irrorata) density and shell length at salt marsh
   sites with heavy oiling to reference conditions similar to 16 months
   after oiling. We also compared periwinkle density and size among oiled
   sites with and without shoreline cleanup treatments. Densities of
   periwinkles were reduced by 80-90\% at the oiled marsh edge and by 50\%
   in the oiled marsh interior (similar to 9 m inland) compared to
   reference, with greatest numerical losses of periwinkles in the marsh
   interior, where densities were naturally higher. Shoreline cleanup
   further reduced adult snail density as well as snail size. Based on the
   size of adult periwinkles observed coupled with age and growth
   information, population recovery is projected to take several years once
   oiling and habitat conditions in affected areas are suitable to support
   normal periwinkle life-history functions. Where heavily oiled marshes
   have experienced accelerated erosion as a result of the spill, these
   habitat impacts would represent additional losses of periwinkles. Losses
   of marsh periwinkles would likely affect other ecosystem processes and
   attributes, including organic matter and nutrient cycling,
   marsh-estuarine food chains, and multiple species that prey on
   periwinkles.}},

Abstract = {{This work encompasses the thermodynamic characterization of four doped
   lanthanum manganites, namely La(0.6)A(0.4)Mn(1-y)Al(y)O(3) (A = Ca, Sr
   and y = 0, 0.4), all showed to be promising redox materials for the
   solar thermochemical splitting of H2O and CO2 to H-2 and CO. We present
   oxygen nonstoichiometry measurements in the temperature range T = 1573
   K-1773 K and oxygen partial pressure range p(o2) = 4.5066 x 10(-2)
   bar-9.9 x 10(-5) bar. For a given rand Po-2, oxygen nonstoichiometry is
   found to be higher when replacing the divalent dopant Sr in
   La0.6Sr0.4MnO3 by the divalent Ca but also increases significantly when
   additionally doping 40 mol-\% Al to the Mn-site. La0.6Ca0.4Mn0.6Al0.4O3
   revealed the highest mass specific oxygen release, 0.290 mol O-2 per kg
   metal oxide at T = 1773 K and po(2) = 2.360 x 10(-3) bar and 0.039 mol
   kg(-1) at T= 1573 K and P-o2 = 4.5066 x 10(-2) bar. It is shown that the
   chemical defect equilibrium of all four perovskites can be accurately
   described by the two simultaneous redox couples Mn4+/Mn3+ and Mn3+/Mn2+.
   Thermodynamic properties, namely partial molar enthalpy, entropy and
   Gibbs free energy are consequently extracted from the defect models.
   Partial molar enthalpy decreases with increasing oxygen nonstoichiometry
   for the Al-doped perovskites whereas the opposite trend is observed for
   the others. The enthalpy falls within the range 260-300 kJ mol(-1) for
   all the materials. Equilibrium hydrogen yields upon oxidation with H2O
   are determined as a function of redox conditions. Although reduction
   extents of the perovskites are greater compared to CeO2, oxidation with
   H2O and CO2 is thermodynamically less favorable. This leads to lower
   mass specific fuel productivity compared to CeO2 under most conditions
   relevant for solar thermochemical cycles. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc.

Title = {{Is a 10-day rainfall forecast of value in dry-land wheat cropping?}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{216}},
Pages = {{170-176}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Grain yields vary widely between seasons in rain-fed agriculture. The
   yield variability is strongly influenced by rainfall variability and a
   number of related crop management decisions. This is well recognised in
   the literature through the use of seasonal rainfall forecasts applied to
   the main cropping decisions. However, the value of short-term 10-day
   rainfall forecasts for management decisions in cropping has not yet been
   quantified. Here we report on the potential benefits of a hypothetical,
   always-correct 10-day rainfall (greater than 10 mm in three days)
   forecast used to determine early and late in-season crop management
   decisions.
   Most of the analysed applications of short-term rainfall forecasts show
   a significant increase in cropping profitability depending on rainfall
   region and soil type. Using a 10-day rainfall forecast to dry-sow prior
   to the traditional start of sowing at the first autumn rainfall can
   yield an extra A\$20,000 to A\$200,000 for a typical farm (i.e. A\$10 to
   A\$100/ha for a 2000 ha cropping programme). The same forecast type can
   be used to determine late in-season decisions on N fertiliser, and
   fungicide applications to control rust at the end-of-ear growth stage.
   In the one-third of seasons with late rainfall, the increased yield or
   decreased fungal damage can lead to benefits of A\$10 to A\$160/ha. When
   10-day rainfall forecasts are applied together within a season, the
   extra benefits from correct short-term forecasts can be cumulative.
   Fine-tuning the forecast length, rainfall thresholds and exploring other
   possible crop decisions could lead to further increased returns in
   cropping from short-term rainfall forecasts. Ultimately, using
   hind-casts of short-term rainfall forecasts to measure the forecast
   skill and the implication of occasional non-correct forecasts will
   determine the actual value of such forecasts. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Protecting biological systems and organic materials from high
   ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a significant issue for engineering
   materials in both terrestrial and space applications. In this study, the
   synthesized composites of polystyrene butyl acrylate (PSBA) encapsulated

   materials for both applications. The UV transmittance of the composite
   films and their physical, thermal, and chemical degradation after
   prolonged exposure to high UV radiation (10 Earth days and 30 Mars
   equivalent days) at low temperatures of 3.4 degrees C were examined. The
   results showed that the composite films blocked the UV radiation and
   there was no significant effect of UV radiation on film integrity,
   mechanical and thermal properties of the composite films when they were
   exposed to high intensity UV radiation (132 W/m(2)) within 24 h.
   Further, FTIR spectra of the composite films before and after UV
   radiation demonstrated that the films did not have notable oxidation
   degradation, although the glass transition temperature was slightly
   decreased with increased exposure time. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Computational characterization of lightweight multilayer MXene Li-ion
   battery anodes}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JAN 11}},
Abstract = {{MXenes, a class of two-dimensional transition metal carbides and
   nitrides, have shown promise experimentally and computationally for use
   in energy storage applications. In particular, the most lightweight
   members of the monolayer MXene family (M = Sc, Ti, V, or Cr) are
   predicted to have gravimetric capacities above 400 mAh/g, higher than
   graphite. Additionally, intercalation of ions into multilayer MXenes can
   be accomplished at low voltages, and low diffusion barriers exist for Li
   diffusing across monolayer MXenes. However, large discrepancies have
   been observed between the calculated and experimental reversible
   capacities of MXenes. Here, dispersion-corrected density functional
   theory calculations are employed to predict reversible capacities and
   other battery-related properties for six of the most promising members
   of the MXene family (O-functionalized Ti-and V-based carbide MXenes) as
   bilayer structures. The calculated reversible capacities of the V2CO2
   and Ti2CO2 bilayers agree more closely with experiment than do previous
   calculations for monolayers. Additionally, the minimum energy paths and
   corresponding energy barriers along the in-plane {[}1000] and {[}0100]
   directions for Li travelling between neighboring MXene layers are
   determined. V4C3O2 exhibits the lowest diffusion barrier of the
   compositions considered, at 0.42 eV, but its reversible capacity (148
   mAh/g) is dragged down by its heavy formula unit. Conversely, the V2CO2
   MXene shows good reversible capacity (276mAh/g), but a high diffusion
   barrier (0.82 eV). We show that the diffusion barriers of all bilayer
   structures are significantly higher than those calculated for the
   corresponding monolayers, advocating the use of dispersed monolayer
   MXenes instead of multilayers in high performance anodes. (C) 2016 AIP

Abstract = {{The nanoindentation hardnesses and stacking fault energies (SFE) for
   pure and alloyed Au are determined from classical molecular dynamics
   simulations. Rather than a traditional force-displacement dependence
   that is examined in many previous nanoindentation works, we analyze the
   hardness vs. force in this study, which shows features that allow us to
   distinguish defect nucleation processes from hardening processes. During
   nanoindentation, homogeneously nucleated defects interact to form
   V-shape lock structures, and finally form four-sided dislocations that
   are continuously released into the bulk, in a manner similar to the
   heterogeneous Frank-Read dislocation generation mechanism. Hardness in
   the alloy system is predicted to be critically controlled by the ease
   and frequency of nucleation of new defects. Consistent with previous
   simulation results, the difference of the unstable and stable SFE,
   rather than the stable SFE along, is found to be closely related to this
   nucleation process, and thus to hardness. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

   high chemical and thermal stability. The purpose of; the barrier
   material is to prevent intermixing or penetration; from the two
   materials that encase it. Adhesion to both top; and bottom materials is
   critical to the success of the barrier.; Here the effectiveness of a
   single atomic layer of graphene as a; solid-state diffusion barrier for
   common metal schemes used in; microelectronics is reviewed, and specific
   examples are discussed. Initial studies of electrical contacts to
   graphene show a distinct separation in behavior between metallic groups
   that strongly or weakly bond to it. The two basic classes of metal
   reactions with graphene are either physisorbed metals; which bond weakly
   with graphene or chemisorbed metals; which bond strongly to graphene.
   For graphene diffusion barrier testing on Si substrates, an effective
   barrier can be achieved through the formation of a carbide layer with
   metals that are chemisorbed. For physisorbed metals, the barrier failure
   mechanism is loss of adhesion at the metal-graphene interface. A
   graphene layer encased between two metal layers, in certain cases; can
   increase the binding energy of both films with graphene, however,
   certain combinations of metal films are detrimental to the bonding with
   graphene. While the prospects for graphene's future as a solid-state
   diffusion barrier are positive; there are open questions, and areas for
   future research are discussed. A better understanding of the mechanisms;
   which influence graphene's ability to be an effective diffusion; barrier
   in microelectronic applications is required; and additional experiments
   are needed on a broader range of metals, as well as common metal stack
   contact structures used in microelectronic applications. The role of
   defects in the graphene is also a key area, since they will probably
   influence the barrier properties.}},

Abstract = {{Partitioning tracer testing was performed in discrete intervals within a
   fractured bedrock tetrachloroethene (PCE) dense nonaqueous-phase liquid
   (DNAPL) source area to assess the fracture flow field and DNAPL
   architecture. Results confirmed that the partitioning tracer testing was
   able to identify and quantify low levels of residual DNAPL along flow
   paths in hydraulically conductive fractures. DNAPL fracture saturations
   (SO ranged from undetectable to 0.007 (DNAPL volume/fracture volume). A
   comparison of the fracture flow field to the DNAPL distribution
   indicated that the highest value of S-n was observed in the least
   transmissive fracture (or fracture zone). Application of a simple
   ambient dissolution model showed that the DNAPL present in this low
   transmissivity zone would persist longer than the DNAPL present in more
   transmissive fractures and would persist for 200 years (in the absence
   of any degradation reactions). Assessment of PCE mass distribution
   between the rock matrix and fractures showed that, due to the presence
   of DNAPL, the rock matrix accounted for less than 10\% of the total PCE
   mass. The evaluation of PCE concentration profiles in the rock matrix
   and the estimated diffusional flux from the rock matrix suggest that the
   elevated PCE groundwater concentrations observed in the fractures likely
   are due to the presence of the residual DNAPL sources and that removal
   of the residual DNAPL sources within the fractures would result in a
   significant decrease in dissolved PCE concentrations in the source area.}},

Abstract = {{A statistical approach combined with molecular dynamics simulations is
   used to study the influence of hydrogen on intergranular decohesion.
   This methodology is applied to a Ni Sigma 3(112){[}1 (1) over bar0]
   symmetric tilt grain boundary. Hydrogenated grain boundaries with
   different H concentrations are constructed using an energy minimization
   technique with initial H atom positions guided by Monte Carlo simulation
   results. Decohesion behavior is assessed through extraction of a
   traction-separation relationship during steady-state crack propagation
   in a statistically meaningful approach, building upon prior work
   employing atomistic cohesive zone volume elements (CZVEs). A sensitivity
   analysis is performed on the numerical approach used to extract the
   traction-separation relationships, clarifying the role of CZVE size,
   threshold parameters necessary to differentiate elastic and decohesion
   responses, and the numerical averaging technique. Results show that
   increasing H coverage at the Ni Sigma 3(112){[}1 (1) over bar0] grain
   boundary asymmetrically influences the crack tip velocity during
   propagation, leads to a general decrease in the work of separation
   required for crack propagation, and provides a reduction in the peak
   stress in the extracted traction-separation relationship. The present
   framework offers a meaningful vehicle to pass atomistically derived
   interfacial behavior to higher length scale formulations for
   intergranular fracture. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{With the integration of advanced computing and communication
   technologies, the Smart Grid is expected to greatly enhance efficiency
   and reliability of future power systems with renewable energy resources,
   as well as distributed intelligence and demand response. Along with the
   salient features of the Smart Grid, cyber security emerges to be a
   critical issue because millions of electronic devices are
   inter-connected via communication networks throughout critical power
   facilities, which has an immediate impact on reliability of such a
   widespread infrastructure. In this paper, we discuss the packet based
   attacks and study the Optimal Inspection Points (OIP) problem, which
   asks us to find a subset of nodes in a given network to perform the Deep
   Packet Inspection so as to maximize the number of scanned packets while
   satisfying the delay constraints. This problem finds many applications
   for malicious attack detection, especially for those cases where each
   single packet or the network traffic is required to be inspected.
   Accordingly, we prove OIP is NP-complete and provide an FPTAS in the
   case of single path routing. For the multiple path routings, we design
   an FPTAS when the routing graph takes a form of series-parallel graphs,
   which is commonly used to model electric networks. We also discuss the
   multi-scan scenario and design PIVOT algorithm to tackle the problem and
   evaluate the algorithms through experiments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Control theoretic techniques are utilised to develop automatic
   controllers that counteract robotic adversarial interventions in the
   operation of asynchronous sequential machines. The scenario centres on
   automatic protection against pre-programmed adversarial agents that
   attempt to subvert the operation of an asynchronous computing system.
   Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of defensive
   controllers that automatically defeat such adversarial agents are
   derived. These conditions are stated in terms of skeleton matrices -
   matrices of zeros and ones obtained directly from the given description
   of the asynchronous sequential machine being protected. When defensive
   controllers exist, a procedure for their design is outlined.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{53}},

Abstract = {{To estimate effective doses for members of the public exposed to
   external radiation from radioactive cesium (Cs-134 and Cs-137) deposited
   on the ground by the Fukushima nuclear accident, we calculate the
   conversion coefficients for converting activity concentration to
   effective dose rate by using the Particle and Heavy Ion Transport Code
   System. The data were produced from different age groups within the
   public (newborns; 1-, 5-, 10-, and 15-year-old children; and adults) for
   the situations in which radioactive cesium is distributed uniformly in
   the soil over a planar area and at specific depths of 0.0, 0.5, 2.5,
   5.0, 10.0, and 50.0 g/cm(2). On the basis of the results, we also derive
   the conversion coefficients for exponentially distributed volumetric
   sources. In addition, we obtain the conversion coefficients that give
   the effective dose accumulated over the first and second months, the
   first year, and over a lifetime (50 years) because of the contamination
   remaining on the ground. These calculations indicate that the conversion
   coefficients to obtain the effective dose rate are higher for the
   younger ages compared with adults, but do not exceed the ambient dose
   equivalent rate. Furthermore, we find that the difference between the
   calculated effective dose rates according to the International
   Commission on Radiological Protection 1990 and 2007 Recommendations is
   small (7\% maximum) for a ground contamination of radioactive cesium.}},

Title = {{High Magnetic Field Annealing of Mn-Ga Intermetallic Alloys}},
Journal = {{MRS ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{227-233}},
Abstract = {{Mn-Ga alloys have shown promising hard magnetic properties, even though
   these alloys contain no rare-earth metals. However, much work is needed
   before Mn-Ga alloys become viable permanent magnets for applications.
   One of the challenges is to enhance the remanence. One technique to
   improve this property is applying a magnetic field during the heat
   treatment process. Magnetic annealing can promote phase transformation
   of the phases with high magnetic moment. This results in an increased
   remanence. Bulk samples of Mn-Ga alloys were made by mechanically
   alloying in order to create a nanostructured composite, followed by heat
   treatments in the presence of a 31 T magnetic field. The heat treatment
   temperatures were kept low in order to keep the refined microstructure.
   All the alloys exhibit hard magnetic properties at room temperature with
   large coercivity. This work reports findings of magnetic field annealed
   Mn-Ga bulk that exhibit high coercivities up to 19.4 kOe and increased
   remanence of 50\% over the binary system, achieving values up to 6.9
   emu/g. This is the highest coercivity reported in bulk Mn-Ga samples.}},

   vector beta when the noise is independent and identically distributed

   single sinusoidal parameter estimation is considered as a particular
   example, and the Cramer-Rao bounds (CRB) for amplitude, frequency, and
   phase estimators are computed for a variety of parameter values. A
   maximum likelihood (ML) estimator for the sinusoidal signal parameters
   is proposed, and its performance is compared with the CRB as a function

   nanotubes (SiNPs-MWNTs) composite paper anodes have been prepared by
   simple, inexpensive, and scalable approach of ultra-sonication and

   conductive pathway within the composite structure, which ensures

   alleviates volume expansion of Si. Through control of Si/C weight ratio,
   we found out the SiNPs-MWNTs electrode with 3: 2 Si/C ratio exhibits the
   optimal balance between high capacity of SiNPs and high conductivity and
   structural stabilization quality of MWNTs, leading to high rate
   capability as well as specific capacity and cycle performance superior
   to conventional slurry-cast SiNPs anode using binder and Cu current
   collector. After 100 cycles, the electrode retains capacity of 1170

Abstract = {{The effect of growth temperature on the annihilation of antiphase domain
   boundaries (APBs) in GaAs grown on 300 mm Si( 001) wafers via an
   industrial III-V metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) tool is
   examined. Samples were grown with identical low temperature nucleation
   layers to set the APB density before growth of bulk layers at varied
   temperature. The APB annihilation rate with respect to GaAs film
   thickness is determined by profiling the APB density in the samples as a
   function of depth using a combination of chemical etchants. It is found
   that higher bulk growth temperatures enhance the annihilation of APBs.
   The increase in APB annihilation rate must be facilitated by a greater
   portion of APBs kinking from \{110\} type planes to higher-index planes
   such as \{111\} or \{112\}. The temperature dependence of APB
   annihilation indicates that there is an associated activation energy for
   the kinking of APBs.}},

Abstract = {{The wide usage of hardware intellectual property (IP) cores from
   untrusted vendors has raised security concerns in the integrated circuit
   (IC) industry. Existing testing methods are designed to validate the
   functionality of the hardware IP cores. These methods often fall short
   in detecting unspecified (often malicious) logic. Formal methods like
   Proof-Carrying Hardware (PCH), on the other hand, can help eliminate
   hardware Trojans and/or design backdoors by formally proving security
   properties on soft IP cores despite the high proof development cost. One
   of the causes to the high cost is the manual conversion of the hardware
   design from RTL code to a domain-specific language prior to
   verification. To mitigate this issue and to lower the overall cost of
   PCH framework, we propose an automatic code converter for translating
   VHDL to Formal-HDL, a domain specific language for representing hardware
   designs in Coq language. Our code converter provides support to wide
   variety of hardware designs. Towards the goal of speeding up the
   verification procedure in our PCH framework, the code converter is the
   important first step. The applicability of the tool is demonstrated by
   converting soft IP cores of AES to its Coq equivalent code.}},

Abstract = {{Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technologies have been widely used
   in many applications, including inventory management, supply chain,
   product tracking, transportation, logistics, etc. Tag estimation, which
   is to estimate the cardinality of a single tag set, is an important
   research topic. This paper expands the estimation research as follows:
   It performs joint estimation between two tag sets (which exist at
   different locations or at the same location but different times). More
   importantly the estimation is fine-grained in an effort to accommodate
   common practical scenarios, where each tag set consists of tags
   belonging to different categories. For any two given tag sets, we want
   to know the detailed information about the joint property of each
   category, instead of just the aggregate information of the whole sets.
   Furthermore, due to the open nature of RFID communications, it is often
   desirable that tag estimation can be performed in an anonymous way
   without revealing the tags' ID information. To support these
   requirements, we develop a new technique called mask bitmap that can
   encode a tag set without requiring the tags to report their IDs or
   category IDs. Any two mask bitmaps of different tag sets can be combined
   to perform category-level joint estimation. Through formal analysis, we
   determine how to set system parameters to meet a given accuracy
   requirement that can be arbitrarily set. Extensive simulation results
   confirm that the proposed solution can yield accurate category-level
   estimates in an efficient way, and preserve tags' anonymity as well.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional radio frequency identification (RFID) technologies allow
   tags to communicate with a reader but not among themselves. By enabling
   peer-to-peer communications among nearby tags, the emerging networked
   tags make a fundamental enhancement to today's RFID systems. This new
   capability supports a series of system-level functions in previously
   infeasible scenarios where the readers cannot cover all tags due to cost
   or physical limitations. This paper makes the first attempt to design a
   new communication model that is specifically tailored to efficient
   implementation of system-level functions in networked tag systems.
   Instead of exploiting complex mechanisms for collision detection and
   resolution, we propose a collision-resistent communication model (CCM)
   that embraces the collision in tag communications and utilizes it to
   merge the data from different sources in a benign way. Two fundamental
   applications: RFID estimation and missing-tag detection, are presented
   to illustrate how CCM assists efficient system-level operations in
   networked tag systems. Simulation results show that system-level
   applications through CCM outperform those through ID collection.}},

Abstract = {{As cybersecurity becomes increasingly relevant with advancing
   technology, Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) have become a
   promising technique that utilize process variation and device mismatch
   to create unique device identifiers, secure keys, and other security
   features that are virtually impossible to duplicate. Many PUF circuits
   with diverse characteristics have been proposed, all of which exhibit a
   clear tradeoff between reliability, robustness, and size. This paper
   proposes a novel PUF which utilizes the nature of stochastic flash
   analog-to-digital (ADCs) to minimize hardware without sacrificing
   reliability or robustness against cloning. The proposed PUF creates a
   unique device identifier by employing the comparators used in a
   stochastic ADC, which are designed for maximum offset voltage due to
   device mismatch. The proposed PUF was modeled and simulated using a
   130nm CMOS process. Simulation results show that the PUF has a
   normalized inter-hamming distance (uniqueness) of 48.5\% and is reliable
   with a normalized average bit flip of 2-3\% over +/- 10\% variance in
   supply voltage and temperatures up to 100 degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{In order to hide long memory latency and alleviate memory bandwidth
   requirement, a fourth-level cache (L4) is introduced in modern
   high-performance multi-core systems for supporting parallel computation.
   However, additional cache level causes higher cache miss penalty since a
   request needs to go through all levels of caches to reach to the main
   memory. In this paper, we introduce a new way of using a Bloom Filter
   (BF) to predict cache misses at any cache level in a multicore system.
   These misses can runahead to access lower-level caches or memory to
   reduce the miss penalty. The proposed hashing scheme extends the cache
   index of the target set and uses it for accessing the BF array to avoid
   counters in the BF array. Performance evaluation using a set of SPEC2006
   benchmarks on 8-core systems with 4-level cache hierarchy shows that
   using a BF for the third-level (L3) cache to filter and runahead L3
   misses, the IPCs can be improved by 4-20\% with an average 10.5\%. In
   comparison with the delay-recalibration scheme, the improvement is
   3.5-4.8\%.}},

   EDA) is introduced which is entirely data-driven and free from
   restricting assumptions and pre-defined problem-or user-specific
   parameters and thresholds. It is well known that the traditional
   probability theory is restricted by strong prior assumptions which are
   often impractical and do not hold in real problems. Machine learning
   methods, on the other hand, are closer to the real problems but they
   usually rely on problem-or user-specific parameters or thresholds making
   it rather art than science. In this paper we introduce a theoretically
   sound yet practically unrestricted and widely applicable approach that
   is based on the density in the data space. Since the data may have
   exactly the same value multiple times we distinguish between the data
   points and unique locations in the data space. The number of data
   points, k is larger or equal to the number of unique locations, I and at
   least one data point occupies each unique location. The number of
   different data points that have exactly the same location in the data
   space (equal value), f can be seen as frequency. Through the combination
   of the spatial density and the frequency of occurrence of discrete data
   points, a new concept called multimodal typicality, tau(MM) is proposed
   in this paper. It offers a closed analytical form that represents
   ensemble properties derived entirely from the empirical observations of
   data. Moreover, it is very close (yet different) from the histograms,
   from the probability density function (pdf) as well as from fuzzy set
   membership functions. Remarkably, there is no need to perform
   complicated pre-processing like clustering to get the multimodal
   representation. Moreover, the closed form for the case of Euclidean,
   Mahalanobis type of distance as well as some other forms (e.g.
   cosine-based dissimilarity) can be expressed recursively making it
   applicable to data streams and online algorithms. Inference/estimation
   of the typicality of data points that were not present in the data so
   far can be made. This new concept allows to rethink the very foundations
   of statistical and machine learning as well as to develop a series of
   anomaly detection, clustering, classification, prediction, control and
   other algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effects of integrating automation into the
   various stages of information processing in a military command and
   control scenario. Command and control (C2) is an extreme decision-making
   paradigm characterized by high uncertainty, high risk, and severe time
   pressure. We introduce a principled approach to decision support system
   (DSS) design that specifically addresses these issues. Our approach
   establishes the principles of communicating confidence in sensor
   estimates and consequence of actions in an intuitive, timely manner. We
   hypothesize that automation designed to communicate confidence and/or
   consequence will improve task performance over systems that neglect
   these concepts. Toward this end, human-subjects experiments were
   conducted to compare the effects of displaying confidence/consequence
   information in a C2 target-tracking and interdiction scenario. Four
   variations of a decision support interface were designed, each with a
   distinct ``degree of automation{''}: (i) an instantaneous sensor
   measurement visualization (baseline), (ii) a confidence-based
   visualization, (iii) a confidence-and consequence-based visualization,
   and (iv) a confidence-and consequence-based visualization with explicit
   decision recommendations. While increasing automation generally improved
   results, the inclusion of consequence information did not have a major
   effect, perhaps because the scenario was overly-simplified.}},

Abstract = {{While autonomous capabilities have proliferated across a wide range of
   commercial and domestic applications, some tasks require intermittent
   aid from a human operator. Guaranteeing the safety of these
   intermittently-teleoperated systems requires stability guarantees that
   hold in the presence of switching. In this paper, we consider the
   problem of controlling a robotic vehicle using both a human controller
   and an autonomous controller. The strategy is to allow the human
   operator to switch between manual control and autonomous control as
   needed. The feedback loop is analyzed and shown to be stable using a
   notion of passivity from nonlinear system analysis. Finally, an example
   is provided to demonstrate the approach.}},

Abstract = {{A dialog-based human-autonomy interaction approach, called curious
   partner, is presented for a class of systems where the role of autonomy
   is to assist humans in decision making tasks. Even if the human and the
   autonomy share the environment and receive identical information, they
   may have inconsistencies in the representation of the environment due to
   difference in their perception and expert knowledge. The curious partner
   interaction framework is presented to resolve model-level differences
   between the human and the autonomy to establish common ground. The
   knowledge base of the autonomy is modeled using a Bayesian engine. The
   autonomy's dialog with the human acts as a feedback mechanism to resolve
   any differences either by suggesting maximally probable actions to human
   based on the state of its Bayesian model or by updating its model to
   achieve analogous world representation.}},

Abstract = {{A study on plastic deformation and damage in titanium was conducted. The
   X-ray tomography data reveal that damage distribution and evolution in
   titanium is markedly different than for a FCC material. Theoretically,
   it is shown that only by modelling both the anisotropy and the
   tension-compression asymmetry in plastic behaviour it is possible to
   realistically predict titanium behaviour. For a smooth specimen under
   uniaxial tension, the model predicts that damage initiates at the centre
   of the specimen, and is diffuse; the level of damage close to failure
   being very low. In contrast, for a notched specimen under the same
   loading it is predicted that damage initiates at the outer surface of
   the specimen, and grows towards the centre of the specimen, which
   corroborates with XCMT data.}},

Abstract = {{0. Results of an experimental study on the quasi-static and high-rate
   plastic deformation due to impact of a high-purity, polycrystalline,
   alpha-titanium material are presented. To quantify the plastic
   anisotropy and tension-compression asymmetry of the material, first
   monotonic uniaxial compression and tension tests were carried out at
   room temperature under quasi-static conditions. It was found that the
   material is transversely isotropic and displays strong strength
   differential effects. To characterize the material's strain rate
   sensitivity, Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar tests in tension and
   compression were also conducted. Taylor impact tests were performed for
   impact velocity of 196 m/s. Plastic deformation extended to 64\% of the
   length of the deformed specimen, with little radial spreading. To model
   simultaneously the observed anisotropy, strain-rate sensitivity, and
   tension-compression asymmetry of the material, a three-dimensional
   constitutive model was developed. Key in the formulation is a
   macroscopic yield function {[}1] that incorporates the specificities of
   the plastic flow, namely the combined effects of anisotropy and
   tension-compression asymmetry. Comparison between model predictions and
   data show the capabilities of the model to describe with accuracy the
   plastic behavior of the alpha-Ti material for both quasi-static and
   dynamic loadings, in particular, a very good agreement was obtained
   between the simulated and experimental post-test Taylor specimen
   geometries.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper is presented a systematic experimental investigation of
   the mechanical response of polycrystalline commercially pure molybdenum
   (Mo). It was established that the material has ductility in tension at
   10(-5)/s and that the failure strain is strongly dependent on the
   orientation. A specimen taken along the rolling direction sustains large
   axial strains (20 \%), while a specimen cut at an angle of 45 to the
   rolling direction could only sustain 5\% strain. Irrespective of the
   loading orientation the yield stress in uniaxial compression is larger
   than in uniaxial tension. While in tension the material has a strong
   anisotropy in Lankford coefficients, in uniaxial compression it displays
   weak strain-anisotropy. An elastic plastic orthotropic model that
   accounts for all the specificities of the plastic deformation of the
   material was developed. Validation of the model was done through
   comparison with data on notched specimens. Quantitative agreement with
   both global and local strain fields was obtained.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, mechanical tests aimed at characterizing the plastic
   anisotropy of a commercially pure alpha-titanium sheet are presented.
   Hemispheric and elliptic bulge tests conducted to investigate the
   forming properties of the material are also reported. To model the
   particularities of the plastic response of the material the classical
   Hill {[}1] yield criterion, and Cazacu et al. {[}2] yield criterion are
   used. Identification of the material parameters involved in both
   criteria is based only on uniaxial test data, while their predictive
   capabilities are assessed through comparison with the bulge tests data.
   Both models reproduce qualitatively the experimental plastic strain
   distribution and the final thickness of the sheet. However, only Cazacu
   et al. {[}2] yield criterion, which accounts for both the anisotropy and
   tension-compression asymmetry of the material captures correctly plastic
   strain localization, in particular its directionality. Furthermore, it
   is shown that accounting for the strong tension-compression asymmetry in
   the model formulation improves numerical predictions regarding the
   mechanical behavior close to fracture of a commercially pure titanium
   alloy under sheet metal forming processes.}},

Abstract = {{Urinary incontinence, overactive bladder, and other dysfunctions of the
   lower urinary tract are conditions which affect millions worldwide,
   imposing a high financial burden and greatly affecting quality of life.
   Diagnosis of these conditions can be facilitated by monitoring bladder
   activity over time. Recent work has demonstrated the feasibility of
   device implantation for chronic bladder pressure monitoring, which can
   help to improve existing diagnostic techniques. For wireless implants, a
   significant portion of the implant power consumption results not from
   pressure sensing, but rather from data transmission. In this paper, we
   present a novel algorithm which is designed to perform efficient,
   on-chip compression of bladder pressure data with tunable quality,
   resulting in significant overall power savings. We validate our approach
   by applying the algorithm to prerecorded bladder pressure data from 14
   human subjects, and demonstrate high average compression ratios (similar
   to 5x), leading to similar reductions in transmission power draw, with
   low reconstruction error (RMSE approximate to 1.09). An ultralow-power
   hardware implementation of the proposed algorithm is obtained by
   synthesizing the design with TSMC 0 : 1 8 mu m technology, yielding an
   area of 1 : 3 4 mm(2) and average power of 2 : 3 n W using low power
   design techniques. To our knowledge, this is the first example of
   dedicated on-chip compression for bladder pressure data designed for an
   ultralow-power biomedical implant.}},

Abstract = {{Partially overlapped channels (POCs) have been studied recently to
   improve network performance. However, the current OFDM-based 802.11
   system is designed for co-channel communication, and does not support
   communication over POCs. Thus the coordination between POCs imposes a
   new challenge to WLANs. In this paper, we present DSN (Data Symbol
   Nulling), a novel communication strategy that leverages the pattern of
   data symbols (null or non-null), rather than the actual data symbol
   value, to convey lightweight control information (or sequences of binary
   bits). The receiver whose channel is partially overlapped with the
   sender, interprets thus-transmitted messages by detecting the energy of
   received data symbols, the minimum resource units in OFDM. A key
   principle of DSN is that the newly designed communication strategy does
   not sacrifice original data throughput. Our extensive results validate
   communication over POCs, and show that lightweight control information
   can be delivered with close to 100\% accuracy. Further, based on this
   communication paradigm, we propose DSN-MAC, an efficient coordination
   scheme between POCs in WLANs. The detailed simulation results show that
   DSN-MAC can substantially improve overall network throughput.}},

Abstract = {{Using genetic profiles of individuals for tailored diagnosis and
   treatment has great promise in the healthcare industry. Despite of the
   rapid growth in genome-aware medicine, genome-aware health monitoring
   has not been studied as well. A major stumbling block is the privacy
   issues of such applications. In addition to privacy concerns in a
   traditional health monitoring system, i.e., the privacy of users'
   biomedical sensing data and the protection of the proprietary health
   monitoring program, severe privacy concerns arise when users' genomic
   data are integrated into the health monitoring program due to the
   reidentification and phenotype attacks based on the DNA profile and the
   relevance of DNA information in a family. In this paper, we investigate
   these privacy risks and propose a privacy-preserving approach for
   genome-aware health monitoring. In our approach, users can only learn
   the diagnostic results based on their genomic and biomedical sensing
   data, while the the healthcare service provider learns nothing. Security
   analysis and performance evaluations are conducted to illustrate the
   effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{In cognitive radio networks (CRNs), spectrum database has been well
   recognized as an effective means to dynamically sharing licensed
   spectrum among primary users (PUs) and secondary users (SUs). In
   spectrum database, the protected incumbents (a.k.a. PUs) and the CRs
   (a.k.a. SUs) are required to register in database their operational
   specifications such as transmitting power, antenna height, time of
   operation and etc. so as to provide an up-to-date radio map for public
   queries and avoid possible interference. However, it poses potentially
   serious privacy problems especially when governmental and military
   systems participate in spectrum sharing through spectrum database. Most
   recent research works in database-driven CRNs, however, only focused on
   protecting user's location privacy but merely studied preserving PUs'
   operational specifications. In this paper, we propose a secure and
   privacy-preserving scheme using hidden policy-assisted attribute-based
   encryption technique to protect sensitive PUs' operational privacy
   without affecting database's accessibility and spectrum utilization
   efficiency. The security and performance analysis demonstrates that our
   scheme is secure and computationally efficient. Additionally, our
   policy-assisted scheme is practical and promising because of its
   consistency with FCC/NTIA's rule in spectrum regulation in
   database-driven CRNs.}},

Abstract = {{Context awareness plays an important role in many emerging applications,
   such as mobile computing and smart space. Since FM signal is ubiquitous,
   it has been recognized as an attractive and promising technique to
   realize context awareness. When a target is at different locations or
   performs different activities, it will exert different influence on the
   FM signal around it. Therefore, it is possible to deduce its location
   and activity by analysing its influence on the FM signal. However, FM
   signal is extremely weak and noisy, which makes it a challenging task to
   achieve high-performance context awareness. In this paper, we propose a
   new method for improving the performance of an FM-based context-aware
   system using multidomain features. Specifically, we extract signal
   features not only from the time domain, but also from the wavelet
   domain, the frequency domain, and the space domain, and construct robust
   and discriminative multi-domain features to characterize the FM signal.
   Furthermore, we also model context awareness as a classification problem
   and develop a robust iterative sparse representation classification
   algorithm to efficiently solve this problem. Extensive experiments
   performed in a 7.2mx10.8m clutter indoor laboratory with one
   multi-channel FM receiver demonstrate that the proposed schemes could
   achieve more than 90\% accuracy of location estimation and activity
   recognition when 3 antennas are used.}},

Abstract = {{The exploding popularity of mobile devices enables people to enjoy
   benefits brought by various interesting mobile apps, such as social
   networking, mobile video services, and location-based services, etc.
   However, the ever-increasing data traffic has exacerbated congestion on
   current cellular networks, which results in users' dissatisfaction,
   especially in crowded areas. Hence, how to deal with the explosive data
   traffic in cellular networks becomes a challenging problem. Traditional
   methods rely on mobile offloading techniques to deviate the data traffic
   targeted to cellular networks, such as small cell, Wi-Fi, and
   opportunistic communication. Unfortunately, mobile users will still
   experience severe congestion when a large number of users request for
   data. Facing these challenges, we introduce the concept of mobile
   participation to assist data offloading by leveraging the mobility of
   mobile users and the social features among a group of users. A mobile
   caching user, who precaches certain amount of contents, can roam around
   congested areas to participate in data dissemination in order to satisfy
   users' requests, which can benefit both herself and users in the crowd
   simultaneously. Therefore, we propose a game theoretical approach to
   analyze the data offloading via mobile participation with joint
   considerations on users' content requests, network effect brought by
   their social features, congestion effect, and pricing strategy. Based on
   detailed performance analysis, we show the feasibility and efficiency of
   the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Thanks to the Internet, voters can cast their ballots over the

   In this paper, we design a practical anonymous E-voting protocol
   (referred to as MVP) based on a novel data collection technique called
   dual random matrix masking (DRMM), which guarantees anonymity with low
   overhead of computation, and achieves the security goals of
   receipt-freeness, double voting detection, fairness, ballot secrecy, and
   integrity. Through extensive analyses on correctness, efficiency, and
   security properties, we demonstrate our proposed MVP protocol can be
   applied to E-voting in a variety of situations with accuracy and

Abstract = {{In distributed storage systems, network coding can be used for reducing
   the amount of storage required to achieve the same level of reliability,
   compared with the current three-duplication schemes. However, in the
   case of a node failure, extra repair cost is required to generate a
   repair node. Meanwhile, to retrieve a certain amount of data, additional
   data may be downloaded to perform the necessary decoding. This
   ``retrieval cost{''}, which may involve extra node access or data
   download, is a major concern in practice but has been generally
   overlooked in theory. In this paper, we propose the point of view that
   there exists a three dimensional tradeoff among storage cost, retrieval
   cost and repair cost. First, we define the three types of cost incurred
   in a network coded distributed storage system, and define the optimal
   tradeoffs among them. Second, we use a regeneration code-based framework
   to verify and illustrate the tradeoff. The results suggest that a cloud
   storage provider may dramatically save the overall cost by tuning to the
   optimal operational point.}},

Abstract = {{Flying UAV network has tremendous potential for civilian and military
   applications. This paper is concerned with the design of a routing
   protocol for fast flying UAV network where UAVs are flying fastly and
   randomly in the sky. Due to the high mobility degree of UAVs, there may
   not exist instantaneous end-to-end communication path; thus, it is
   particularly challenging to design an available routing protocol with
   low transmission delay. The contribution of this paper is that we
   propose a Fountain-code based Greedy Queue and Position Assisted routing
   protocol, called FGQPA. It designs a Power Allocation and Routing (PAR)
   policy to relief the effect of the queue backlog on the overall network
   delay and employs a ``nearest span{''} scheme to direct packets to the
   destination with a small delay. Our experimental results show that the
   proposed FGQPA can achieve lower transmission delay than the
   state-of-the-art disruption tolerant network routing protocol.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an extended impedance-based fault location
   formulation for unbalanced distributed generation systems. In recent
   years, distributed generation has become an efficient and economical

   currents affecting the accuracy of impedance-based fault location
   methods. This work proposes a extended mathematical formulation based on
   the apparent impedance for synchronous based DG active distribution
   systems. The proposed formulation was implemented in Matlab and had it's

Abstract = {{The kernel least mean square (KLMS) algorithm is an efficient non-linear
   adaptive filter that operates in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space
   (RKHS). In realistic applications of system identification or time
   series prediction, there are usually multiple inputs that demand
   multiple kernels or kernel parameters. This paper proposes to use a
   tensor product kernel for KLMS that accommodates multiple inputs.
   Furthermore, instead of arbitrarily setting kernel parameters,
   appropriate kernel sizes can be chosen by a gradient descent based
   adaptive algorithm that minimizes the square of instant error, which
   helps KLMS to better capture the underlying system mechanism.
   Effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is shown by experiments
   conducted for both simulated dataset and an important real-world problem
   - Beijing PM2.5 prediction.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose to deal with the problems of logistic
   regression with outliers and class imbalance, which are common in a wide
   range of practical applications. The robust bounded logistic regression
   with different error costs is developed to reduce the combined influence
   of outliers and class imbalance. First, inspired by the Correntropy
   induced loss function, we develop the bounded logistic loss function
   which is a monotonic, bounded and nonconvex loss and thus robust to
   outliers. With the bounded logistic loss, we construct a new robust
   logistic regression. Second, under the principle of cost-sensitive
   learning, we assign different error costs for different classes in order
   to reduce the sensitiveness of the new robust logistic regression to
   class imbalance. Using the half-quadratic optimization method, it is
   easy to optimize the proposed logistic regression model. Experimental
   results demonstrate that our proposed method improves the performance of
   logistic regression on the datasets with outliers and class imbalance.}},

Abstract = {{A tracking controller is developed for a class of uncertain nonlinear
   systems with bounded external disturbances and time-varying input delay.
   Inspired by predictor-based delay compensators, the current result
   exploits a linear transformation to map the time dependent control input
   to a modified control input that depends on both time and a spatial
   variable. This transformation enables the developed controller to be
   applied when the delay rate is upper bounded by an arbitrarily large
   bound, unlike previous robust control approaches. However, unlike
   previous predictor-based methods, the development of a novel auxiliary
   error signal that includes an integral of past control values
   facilitates a robust control design that is applicable to uncertain
   nonlinear systems. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis that uses
   Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals is used to prove the developed
   controller yields exponential convergence of the tracking error to a
   steady-state residual (i.e., uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) tracking
   errors). Numerical simulation results are also provided to illustrate
   the performance of the controller for different delay rates. (C) 2016,

Abstract = {{True random number generators (TRNGs) play an important role in trusted
   execution and communication for modern system on chips (SoCs). Building
   a TRNG in today's SoCs is complex and often challenging because it must
   have uniform statistical characteristics at any operating condition and
   workload, and in hostile environments over the entire system lifetime.
   The startup outputs of SRAM cells, another vital component in SoCs, have
   been used to generate random numbers and/or unique keys. However, the
   quality of existing SRAM based TRNGs is limited due to limited amount of
   entropy which also can be manipulated by operating voltage or
   temperature. Another disadvantage of the existing SRAM-based TRNG is
   that the system requires power off and on to obtain random numbers which
   hampers the system performance. In this paper, we propose a noise
   sensitive embedded SRAM (NS-SRAM) based TRNG that reliably provides
   unpredictable random numbers at high rates regardless of the operating
   conditions. We design a noise sensitive SRAM and propose a technique
   that utilizes the existing power-management scheme to obtain random
   numbers. We evaluate the quality of NS-SRAM based TRNGs for 90nm, 45nm,
   and 32nm technology nodes. The proposed NS-SRAM based TRNG is similar to
   275X faster and similar to 432X more area efficient (excluding
   post-processing overhead) than existing SRAM based TRNGs.}},

   70\%). The best absorbers at each Ga/III composition were characterized
   with time-resolved photoluminescence, scanning electron microscopy, and
   secondary ion mass spectrometry, and devices were studied with
   temperature-dependent current density-voltage, light and electrical
   biased quantum efficiency, and capacitance-voltage. The best cells with
   Ga/III similar to 30, 50, and 70\% had efficiencies of 14.5, 14.4, and
   12.2\% and maximum power temperature coefficients of -0.496, -0.452, and
   -0.413\%/degrees C, respectively. This resulted in the Ga/III similar to
   50\% champion having the highest efficiency at temperatures greater than
   40 degrees C, making it the optimal composition for practical purposes.
   This optimum is understood as a result of the absorber's band gap
   grading-where minimum band gap dominates short-circuit current density,
   maximum space charge region band gap dominates open-circuit voltage, and
   average absorber band gap dominates maximum power temperature
   coefficient.}},

   spatiotemporal dynamic communication between brain areas. Thus, the
   quantification of functional connectivity with high temporal resolution
   is highly desirable for capturing in vivo brain function. However, brain
   functional network quantification from EEG recordings has been commonly
   used in a qualitative manner. In this paper, we consider pairwise
   dependence measures as random variables and estimate the pdf for each
   electrode of the arrangement. A metric imposed by the quadratic
   Cauchy-Schwartz Mutual Information quantifies these pdfs. We present the
   results by brain regions simplifying the analysis and visualization
   drastically. The proposed metric of functional connectivity
   quantification is addressed for temporal dependencies of the brain

Abstract = {{Reinforcement learning is an effective algorithm for brain machine
   interfaces (BMIs) which interprets the mapping between neural activities
   with plasticity and the kinematics. Exploring large state-action space
   is difficulty when the complicated BMIs needs to assign credits over
   both time and space. For BMIs attention gated reinforcement learning
   (AGREL) has been developed to classify multi-actions for spatial credit
   assignment task with better efficiency. However, the outliers existing
   in the neural signals still make interpret the neural-action mapping
   difficult. We propose an enhanced AGREL algorithm using correntropy as a
   criterion, which is more insensitive to noise. Then the algorithm is
   tested on the neural data where the monkey is trained to do the obstacle
   avoidance task. The new method converges faster during the training
   period, and improves from 44.63\% to 68.79\% on average in success rate
   compared with the original AGREL. The result indicates that the
   combination of correntropy criterion and AGREL can reduce the effect of
   the outliers with better performance when interpreting the mapping
   between neural signal and kinematics.}},

Abstract = {{Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is commonly used in
   rehabilitation therapy for people with injuries or various neurological
   disorders. Noninvasive treatments use surface electrodes to provide a
   potential field across the muscle and induce contractions/output force.
   The placement of the electrodes has a significant impact on the induced
   force output. As the muscle geometry changes (i.e., muscle lengthening
   or shortening), the force induced by the static electrode placement may
   also change. In this paper, an array of electrodes is placed across the
   biceps brachii and the electric field is switched across the electrodes
   (i.e., channels) to maximize the induced muscle force throughout the
   arm's range of motion, despite changes in the muscle geometry. To yield
   this outcome, a switched systems approach is used to develop a
   position-based switching law for the uncertain nonlinear system.
   Specifically, a switched robust sliding mode controller is developed to
   track a desired angular trajectory about the elbow. Lyapunov-based
   methods for switched systems are used to prove global exponential
   tracking and experimental results demonstrate the performance of the
   switched control system.}},

Abstract = {{Cycling induced by functional electrical stimulation (FES) of the lower
   limb muscles is a common rehabilitative treatment. In this paper, a
   repetitive learning controller (RLC) is developed for cadence tracking
   during stationary FES-cycling. The RLC is developed for an uncertain,
   nonlinear cycle-rider system with autonomous state-dependent switching.
   The stimulation pattern switches across different muscle groups based on
   the joint effectiveness to produce torque during different regions of
   the crank cycle. An electric motor provides assistance in the regions of
   the crank cycle where the activation of the muscle groups yields low
   torque production. The developed RLC provides asymptotic cadence
   tracking despite the presence of unknown, time-varying, bounded
   disturbances. A Lyapunov-like stability analysis is implemented to
   generate the learning feedforward term and exploits a recently developed
   LaSalle-Yoshizawa corollary for nonsmooth systems.}},

Abstract = {{The feedback particle filter (FPF) is an approach to estimating the
   posterior distribution of the states in a process-observation model. As
   in other versions of the particle filter, Monte Carlo methods are used
   to generate and propagate a set of particles, based on the underlying
   model. The system is designed so that the empirical distribution of the
   particles approximates the posterior distribution. In contrast to other
   approaches, particles are propagated as a controlled system using a gain
   function that is similar in nature to the Kalman gain for linear
   Gaussian systems. The FPF gain is obtained as a solution to a version of
   Poisson's equation. Approximation techniques are required, since the FPF
   gain has no closed-form solution.
   This paper presents a new approach to gain synthesis, based in part on a
   recent breakthrough in the theory of Poisson's equation for diffusions.
   The architecture begins with a finite-dimensional family of smooth
   densities (such as a class of Gaussian mixtures), denoted P. Gain
   approximation proceeds in two steps:
   (i) An optimal choice of p is an element of P is chosen, based on the
   histogram of particles. Computation can be performed using the
   expectation maximization (EM) algorithm.
   (ii) Based on (i), an approximation to the FPF gain is obtained by
   applying the del-TD Learning algorithm that was recently introduced by
   the authors.}},

Abstract = {{The aggregation of renewable energy has significant potential to
   mitigate undesirable characteristics such as intermittency and
   variability and thereby facilitate grid integration. Using cooperative
   game theory, it has been shown that aggregation is also beneficial for
   renewable energy producers because they can increase their expected
   profit by making a coalition, bidding a joint contract that maximizes
   the expected profit and sharing the profit in a way that keeps the game
   stable. However, we show that the realized (as opposed to expected)
   profit of the coalition, using the contract that maximizes the expected
   profit, cannot be suitably distributed among its members. We propose an
   alternative coalition contract and prove that it allows for a
   satisfactory distribution of the realized profit among the coalition
   members keeping the game stable. We design a new payoff allocation that
   lies in the core of the game of the realized profit. Finally, we analyze
   the cost of stabilizing the game by evaluating the loss of expected
   profit that a coalition incurs by bidding the stabilizing contract.}},

Abstract = {{Value functions arise as a component of algorithms as well as
   performance metrics in statistics and engineering applications.
   Computation of the associated Bellman equations is numerically
   challenging in all but a few special cases.
   A popular approximation technique is known as Temporal Difference (TD)
   learning. The algorithm introduced in this paper is intended to resolve
   two well-known problems with this approach: In the discounted-cost
   setting, the variance of the algorithm diverges as the discount factor
   approaches unity. Second, for the average cost setting, unbiased
   algorithms exist only in special cases.
   It is shown that the gradient of any of these value functions admits a
   representation that lends itself to algorithm design. Based on this
   result, the new differential TD method is obtained for Markovian models
   on Euclidean space with smooth dynamics.
   Numerical examples show remarkable improvements in performance. In
   application to speed scaling, variance is reduced by two orders of
   magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{The paper concerns design of control systems for Demand Dispatch to
   obtain ancillary services to the power grid by harnessing inherent
   flexibility in many loads. The role of ``local intelligence{''} at the
   load has been advocated in prior work; randomized local controllers that
   manifest this intelligence are convenient for loads with a finite number
   of states. The present work introduces two new design techniques for
   these randomized controllers:
   (i) The Individual Perspective Design (IPD) is based on the solution to
   a one-dimensional family of Markov Decision Processes, whose objective
   function is formulated from the point of view of a single load. The
   family of dynamic programming equation appears complex, but it is shown
   that it is obtained through the solution of a single ordinary
   differential equation.
   (ii) The System Perspective Design (SPD) is motivated by a single
   objective of the grid operator: Passivity of any linearization of the
   aggregate input-output model. A solution is obtained that can again be
   computed through the solution of a single ordinary differential
   equation.
   Numerical results complement these theoretical results.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a geometric model reduction method, the proper symplectic
   decomposition (PSD) with structure-preserving projection, is proposed
   for model reduction of forced Hamiltonian systems. As an analogy to the

   to build a symplectic subspace to fit empirical data, while the
   structure-preserving projection is developed to reconstruct reduced
   systems while simultaneously preserving the symplectic and forced
   structure. In a special case when the external force is described by the
   Rayleigh dissipative function, the proposed method automatically
   preserves the dissipativity of the original system. The stability,

   using multiple cameras in the fruit detection layer of the vision

   reduce computation time. In the presence of noise, heuristics are
   presented to identify the greatest subset of cameras with matched
   fruits. Subsequently, the fruit depth is obtained by minimizing the
   summation of the image reprojection error in cameras with matching
   fruit. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to establish localization

Abstract = {{Huanglongbing (HLB), also known as yellow shoot or citrus greening, is a
   devastating disease, associated with `Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus
   (CLas).' Unfortunately, there is no effective cure for this disease, and
   since a tree is infected, it will eventually die. HLB has negatively
   affected citrus industries in many countries in Africa, Asia, and South
   America. In 2005, HLB was confirmed in a groove in South Florida, and
   after a few years, the entire state of Florida got infected. Timely
   detection and removal of HLB-affected trees are substantially necessary
   for managing the disease. Accumulation of starch that appears as
   yellow/light-green islands on the citrus leaf is known as an early
   diagnostic symptom of HLB. A polarized imaging system was used to follow
   the hyper-accumulation of starch in leaves of graft-inoculated citrus
   plants. Time-lapse images of citrus leaves were acquired in a weekly
   manner after plants were grafted with a disk from another HLB-affected
   leaf to follow the variation in the images' gray values at different
   locations on a leaf. An image analysis algorithm was developed to
   highlight the regions of citrus leaf samples with an increase in average
   gray value as an indication of starch accumulation in the
   pre-symptomatic stage. The proposed method was able to detect
   successfully any local increase in the image gray values which
   associates with hyper-accumulation of starch, and consequently, the
   existence of CLas. (C) 2016, IFAC (International Federation Control)

Abstract = {{Harvesting efficiency is a critical factor in determining whether
   robotic harvesting can be economically superior to hand picking. One
   practical challenge in robotic harvesting is to grasp a moving fruit,
   where unsuccessful pick cycles may result in lower harvesting
   efficiency. The fruit motion can be due to exogenous disturbances such
   as wind gust, canopy unloading, and particularly, fruit detachment
   forces. In this paper, an adaptive visual servo control law is presented
   to estimate and subsequently compensate the unknown time varying fruit
   motion. The fruit motion in the image plane and along the optical axis
   is modeled as a second-order spring-mass system. The unknown parameters
   of fruit motion are identified using an adaptive parameter update law,
   and a robust feedback term is included in the control law to account for
   modeling uncertainties. Lyapunov-based stability analysis guarantees
   uniformly ultimately bounded regulation of the robot to the fruit
   position. Sin mlation results are provided to verify the feasibility of
   the developed controller. (C) 2016, IFAC (International Federation of

Abstract = {{Reverse engineering of electronic hardware has been performed for
   decades for two broad purposes: (1) honest and legal means for failure
   analysis and trust verification; and (2) dishonest and illegal means of
   cloning, counterfeiting, and development of attacks on hardware to gain
   competitive edge in a market. Destructive methods have been typically
   considered most effective to reverse engineer Printed Circuit Boards
   (PCBs) - a platform used in nearly all electronic systems to
   mechanically support and electrically connect all hardware components.
   However, the advent of advanced characterization and imaging tools such
   as X-ray tomography has shifted the reverse engineering of electronics
   toward non-destructive methods. These methods considerably lower the
   associated time and cost to reverse engineer a complex multi-layer PCB.
   In this paper, we introduce a new anti reverse engineering method to
   protect PCBs from non-destructive reverse engineering. We add high-Z
   materials inside PCBs and develop advanced layout algorithms, which

   as greater numbers of counterfeit integrated circuits (IC) infiltrate
   the global market. There is an ongoing effort in experimental and
   national labs inside the United States to detect and prevent such

   missing piece to automatically detect and properly keep record of
   detected counterfeit ICs. Here, we introduce a web application database
   that allows users to share previous examples of counterfeits through an

Abstract = {{Bond pull testing, a well-known method in the failure analysis
   community, is used to evaluate the integrity of an electronic microchip
   as well as to detect counterfeit ICs. Existing bond pull tests require
   that the microchip be de-capsulated in order to obtain physical access
   to the bond wires in the IC package. Bond pull analysis based on
   simulation and finite element methods also exists but relies on the
   original model for a bond wire from a CAD design. In this work, we
   introduce X-ray tomography imaging with 700nm imaging resolution to
   acquire the 3D geometry details of bond wires non-destructively. Such
   information can be used to develop more accurate models for finite
   element analysis based on real size and structure. Therefore, one can
   test the bond wire strength as a proof of concept for virtual mechanical
   testing and counterfeit detection in microchips.}},

Abstract = {{In an effort to offset the rapidly increasing data volume processed by
   large data centers today, their architects have increasingly been
   exploring unconventional architectures like FPGAs. Large-scale RC
   systems like Novo-G\# show promise for both big-data processing and HPC,
   but are limited by a lengthy and difficult design process. In this paper
   we present a mixed MPI/OpenCL framework that enables rapid and simple
   multi-FPGA app development on Novo-G\# with support for multidimensional
   inter-FPGA communication. The framework encapsulates inter-FPGA links
   into Altera OpenCL channels, abstracting away many of the complexities
   of inter-FPGA communication, and achieves an aggregate data rate of 288
   Gbps per FPGA over six input and six output links. We use case studies
   and analysis to showcase a methodology for efficient design of
   multi-FPGA OpenCL apps on Novo-G\# with our framework, and demonstrate
   its use to create various multi-FPGA applications.}},

Abstract = {{The need to analyze increasingly larger graph datasets has driven the
   exploration of new methods and unique system architectures for graph
   processing. One such method moves away from the typical edge-and
   vertex-centric approaches and describes graph algorithms using
   linear-algebra operations, bringing the added benefits of predictable
   data-access patterns and ease of implementation. The performance of this
   approach is limited by the sparse nature of graph adjacency matrices,
   which leads to inefficient use of memory bandwidth, and reduced
   scalability in distributed systems. In order to maximize the scalability
   and performance of these linear-algebra systems, we require new
   sparse-matrix storage formats capable of maximizing memory throughput
   and minimizing latency, while maintaining low storage overhead. In this
   paper, we present an overview of a novel sparse-matrix storage format
   called Hashed-Index Sparse-Column/Row (HISC/R) which guarantees
   constant-time row or column access complexity at low storage overhead,
   while also supporting online non-zero element insertions and deletions.
   We evaluate the performance of HISC/R using randomly generated Kronecker
   graphs, demonstrating a 19\% reduction in memory footprint, and 40\%
   reduction in memory reads, for sparse matrix/matrix multiplication
   compared to competing formats.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an acoustically engineered nano-waveguide resonator
   implemented in an aluminum nitrideon-silicon bilayer with an overall
   thickness of less than 200nm. Acoustic engineering using dispersion
   characteristics of laterally propagating waves with cross-sectional
   flexural polarization has been used to realize efficient energy trapping
   without the need for narrow suspending supports, thus improving device
   power handling. Having a large aspect ratio, the bilayer nano-waveguide
   resonator experiences an amplified thermally induced axial stress, which
   results in a very high temperature coefficient of its resonance
   frequency. Such characteristics along with the minuscule volume and
   large peripheral acoustic energy density make the device an exceptional
   candidate for sensing applications where an increased thermal
   responsivity and large interaction cross-section are desirable. A
   prototype device operating at similar to 870kHz frequency with a Q of
   similar to 140- measured in air - shows a vibration amplitude of 100nm
   at 3V and a linear TCF of similar to-710 ppm / degrees C when actuated
   piezoelectrically with 500 mv at resonance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a novel method for passive DC current sensing without
   using a cord separator. In this method, a piezoelectric thin-film
   cantilever with a micro-magnet on its end is positioned near a power
   cord. The DC current in the power cord induces a magnetic field, which
   generates a magnetic force acting on the micro-magnet. Consequently, the
   piezoelectric cantilever is bent and induces an output voltage that is
   sensitive to any rapid change of the DC current. Compared to Hall effect
   based sensing, this method has the advantages of no need of driving
   voltage or cord separators even for two-wire appliance cords. The device
   has been successfully fabricated and experimentally studied. It was
   found that the initial peak amplitude of the piezoelectric output
   voltage increases linearly with the DC current value upon ``O-NOFF{''}
   switching. This self-sensing, non-contact passive piezoelectric DC
   current sensing method is more convenient than Hall sensors in measuring
   and monitoring DC current particularly for consumer electronics.}},

Abstract = {{In this chapter, we consider the problem of efficiently evacuating all
   people in an urban area from danger zones to safe zones. This problem,
   which has attracted major scientific interest and has been well-studied
   in literature, is indeed large-scale, and as such difficult to solve. In
   this work, we propose a solution method based on an islanding scheme.
   This decomposition approach takes into consideration the betweenness of
   a set of nodes in the transportation network, and aims to obtain
   clusters from those nodes that can be easily solved: the idea is to
   divide the flow more evenly towards multiple paths to safety, leading to
   a more robust evacuation process. We portray our results on several
   synthetic and real-life transportation networks. More importantly, we
   use a very large-scale network representation of the city of
   Jacksonville, Florida, in the USA to show that our approaches solve the
   problem, a feat that proved impossible for commercial solvers. We
   conclude this study with our observations and plans for future work.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the issue of minimizing data center energy
   usage. In particular, we formulate a problem of virtual machine
   placement with the objective of minimizing the total power consumption
   of all the servers. To do this, we examine a CPU power consumption model
   and then incorporate the model into an mixed integer programming
   formulation. In order to find optimal or near-optimal solutions fast, we
   resolve two difficulties: non-linearity of the power model and integer
   decision variables. We first show how to linearize the problem, and then
   give a relaxation and iterative rounding algorithm. Computation
   experiments have shown that the algorithm can solve the problem much
   faster than the standard integer programming algorithms, and it
   consistently yields near-optimal solutions. We also provide a heuristic
   min-cost algorithm, which finds less optimal solutions but works even
   faster.}},

Abstract = {{Computational clouds have evolved to go beyond cost-effective on-demand
   hosting of IT resources and elasticity. The added features now include
   the ability to offer entire IT systems as a service that can quickly
   adapt to changing business environments. The new trend introduces
   challenges in datacenter resource management, including scalability,
   system-orientation, and optimization supporting both datacenter
   efficiency and customer system agility and performance. The conventional
   approach of resource management adopts a flat fine-grained model that
   results in problem formulations of enormous sizes; it also has the
   drawback of being less flexible in meeting customers' need. In this
   paper, we introduce a pack-centric approach to datacenter resource
   management by abstracting a system as a pack of resources and
   considering the mapping of these packs onto physical datacenter resource
   groups, called swads. The assignments of packs to swads are formulated
   as mixed integer programming problems. Scalability is achieved through a
   hierarchical decomposition method and parallel solvers. The new
   datacenter resource management framework is illustrated with a concrete
   resource placement problem. Numerical experiments show the scalability
   of the hierarchical decomposition method and the benefits of the overall
   framework.}},

Abstract = {{Portfolio optimization models are usually based on several distribution
   characteristics, such as mean, variance or Conditional Value-at-Risk
   (CVaR). For instance, the mean-variance approach uses mean and
   covariance matrix of return of instruments of a portfolio. However this
   conventional approach ignores tails of return distribution, which may be
   quite important for the portfolio evaluation. This chapter considers the
   portfolio optimization problems with the Stochastic Dominance
   constraints. As a distribution-free decision rule, Stochastic Dominance
   takes into account the entire distribution of return rather than some
   specific characteristic, such as variance. We implemented efficient
   numerical algorithms for solving the optimization problems with the
   Second-Order Stochastic Dominance (SSD) constraints and found portfolios
   of stocks dominating Dow Jones and DAX indices. We also compared
   portfolio optimization with SSD constraints with the Minimum Variance
   and Mean-Variance portfolio optimization.}},

Title = {{Development of an 1100C Crushable Nose Surrogate Vehicle for Low-Speed
   Impact Testing of Breakaway Hardware}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{In the development of breakaway roadside safety hardware, surrogate
   vehicles offer an efficient, cost-effective means of testing new
   breakaway design concepts and evaluating system performance in
   accordance with applicable standards. For the purposes of conducting
   low-speed impact testing, a crushable nose impactor, when combined with
   a gravity pendulum, can constitute a suitable surrogate alternative to a
   production vehicle. This paper describes the development of a crushable
   nose impactor that can serve as a surrogate version of the 1100C
   passenger car described in AASHTO's Manual for Assessing Safety
   Hardware. The design of the new crushable nose was based on published
   force-deformation data collected from crash testing of a Kia Rio
   production passenger car. The new crushable nose differs from other
   designs in that it is intended specifically for use in low-speed impact
   testing of breakaway hardware; the nose uses tapered (i.e., trapezoidal)
   aluminum honeycomb cartridges, which permits improved approximation of
   the production vehicle force-deformation curve; and the cartridge design
   process incorporates insights gained through high-deformation
   compression testing of aluminum honeycomb materials. This paper
   documents (a) the analysis techniques that were used iteratively to
   design the new crushable nose and (b) the final dimensions of the
   configured cartridges. The results from rigid pole validation impact
   testing of the crushable nose impactor, conducted with the Florida
   Department of Transportation's gravity pendulum, are presented and shown
   to be in good agreement with the production vehicle force-deformation
   data.}},

Abstract = {{Fraud detection in electricity consumption is a major challenge for
   power distribution companies. While many pattern recognition techniques
   have been applied to identify electricity theft, they often require
   extensive handcrafted feature engineering. Instead, through deep layers
   of transformation, nonlinearity, and abstraction, Deep Learning (DL)
   automatically extracts key features from data. In this paper, we design
   spatial and temporal deep learning solutions to identify nontechnical
   power losses (NTL), including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long
   Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Stacked Autoencoder. These models are
   evaluated in a modified IEEE 123-bus test feeder. For the same tests, we
   also conduct comparison experiments using three conventional machine
   learning approaches: Random Forest, Decision Trees and shallow Neural
   Networks. Experimental results demonstrate that the spatiotemporal deep
   learning approaches outperform conventional machine learning approaches.}},

Abstract = {{A network of vehicular cyber-physical systems (VCPSs) can use wireless
   communications to interact with each other and the surrounding
   environment to improve transportation safety, mobility, and
   sustainability. However, cloud-oriented architectures are vulnerable to
   cyber attacks, which may endanger passenger and pedestrian safety and
   privacy, and cause severe property damage. For instance, a hacker can
   use message falsification attack to affect functionality of a particular
   application in a platoon of VCPSs. In this paper, a neural network-based
   fault detection technique is applied to detect and track fault data
   injection attacks on the cooperative adaptive cruise control layer of a
   platoon of connected vehicles in real time. A decision support system
   was developed to reduce the probability and severity of any consequent
   accident. A case study with its design specifications is demonstrated in
   detail. The simulation results show that the proposed method can improve
   system reliability, robustness, and safety.}},

Abstract = {{Cyberbullying can have a deep and long lasting impact on its victims,
   who are often adolescents. Accurately detecting cyberbullying helps
   prevent it. However, the noise and errors in social media posts and
   messages make detecting cyberbullying very challenging. In this paper,
   we propose a novel pronunciation based convolutional neural network
   (PCNN) to address this challenge. Upon observing that the pronunciation
   of misspelled words in informal online conversations is often unchanged,
   we used the phoneme codes of the text as the features for a
   convolutional neural network. This procedure corrects spelling errors
   that did not alter the pronunciation, thereby alleviating the problem of
   noise and bullying data sparsity. To overcome class imbalance, a common
   problem in cyberbullying datasets, we implement three techniques that
   include thresholdmoving, cost function adjusting, and a hybrid solution
   in our model. We evaluate the performance of our models using two
   cyberbullying datasets collected from Twitter and Formspring. me. The
   results of our experiment show that PCNN can achieve improved recall and
   precision compared to baseline convolutional neural networks.}},

Abstract = {{Posttraumatic epilepsy (PTE) is one of the most common and devastating
   complications of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Currently, the
   etiopathology and mechanisms of PTE are poorly understood and as a
   result, there is no effective treatment or means to prevent it.
   Antiepileptic drugs remain common preventive strategies in the
   management of TBI to control acute posttraumatic seizures and to prevent
   the development of PTE, although their efficacy in the latter case is
   disputed. Different strategies of PTE prophylaxis have been showing
   promise in preclinical models, but their translation to the clinic still
   remains elusive due in part to the variability of these models and the
   fact they do not recapitulate all complex pathologies associated with
   human TBI. TBI is a multifaceted disorder reflected in several
   potentially epileptogenic alterations in the brain, including mechanical
   neuronal and vascular damage, parenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhage,
   subsequent toxicity caused by iron-rich hemoglobin breakdown products,
   and energy disruption resulting in secondary injuries, including
   excitotoxicity, gliosis, and neuroinflammation, often coexisting to a
   different degree. Several in vivo models have been developed to
   reproduce the acute TBI cascade of events, to reflect its anatomical
   pathologies, and to replicate neurological deficits. Although acute and
   chronic recurrent posttraumatic seizures are well-recognized phenomena
   in these models, there is only a limited number of studies focused on
   PTE. The most used mechanical TBI models with documented
   electroencephalographic and behavioral seizures with remote
   epileptogenesis include fluid percussion, controlled cortical impact,
   and weight-drop. This chapter describes the most popular models of
   PTE-induced TBI models, focusing on the controlled cortical impact and
   the fluid percussion injury models, the methods of behavioral and
   electroencephalogram seizure assessments, and other approaches to detect
   epileptogenic properties, and discusses their potential application for
   translational research.}},

Journal = {{ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS IN PROBABILITY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Abstract = {{Consider a Markov process Phi = \{Phi (t) : t >= 0 g evolving on a
   Polish space X. A version of the f-Norm Ergodic Theorem is obtained:
   Suppose that the process is psi-irreducible and aperiodic. For a given
   function f : X -> {[}1, infinity), under suitable conditions on the
   process the following are equivalent:
   (i) There is a unique invariant probability measure pi satisfying
   integral f d pi < infinity.
   (ii) There is a closed set C satisfying psi(C) > 0 that is ``self
   f-regular.{''}
   (iii) There is a function V : X -> ( 0, infinity] that is finite on at
   least one point in X, for which the following Lyapunov drift condition
   is satisfied,
   D V <= - f + b IIC, (V3)
   where C is a closed small set and D is the extended generator of the
   process.
   For discrete-time chains the result is well-known. Moreover, in that
   case, the ergodicity of Phi under a suitable norm is also obtained: For
   each initial condition x epsilon X satisfying V (x) < infinity, and any
   function g : X -> R for which broken vertical bar g broken vertical bar
   is bounded by f,
   lim (t -> infinity) E-x {[}g (Phi(t))] = integral gd pi.
   Possible approaches are explored for establishing appropriate versions
   of corresponding results in continuous time, under appropriate
   assumptions on the process Phi or on the function g.}},

Abstract = {{Active learning approaches are becoming of increasing importance within
   engineering education, and it has been established that an active
   learning environment leads to improved student outcomes. What are less
   known are the ways in which these classes support student learning. Our
   study takes place in the context of a Process Oriented Guided Inquiry
   Learning (POGIL) classroom. We use grounded theory to answer the
   research question: How do students construct knowledge in a POGIL
   classroom? Constructivist grounded theory was used to code student
   interview data and develop a theory of how student learning occurs. The
   resulting theory shows that the use of POGIL results in a
   concept-focused class, as opposed to focusing on discrete aspects of
   knowledge (facts). This concept-focused class provides for both
   conceptual understanding and improved retention of information. The
   findings illustrate one way to design a class for deep conceptual
   understanding and suggest broader implications for curriculum design.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, are frequently used for

   While personal identification numbers and passwords have been the

   disadvantages have caused researchers to explore biometric
   authentication for accurate and convenient mobile device security by
   taking advantage of refined sensing technologies which capture
   environmental, positional, and interactive information. This information
   has been found useful in uniquely modeling physical and behavioral
   characteristics such that biometric recognition is feasible. In this
   paper, over 100 biometric approaches to mobile device security are
   surveyed. The advantages and research challenges associated with ten
   biometric modalities are provided, along with discussion of various

Abstract = {{Dissipativity is a useful tool for analyzing and synthesizing stable
   feedback systems. Briefly, the property of dissipativity is that a
   system only stores and dissipates energy, with respect to a given energy
   storage function, and does not generate its own energy. This property
   carries a strong reliance on a notion of time that prohibits its direct
   application to discrete event systems (DES). The current paper takes the
   concept of dissipativity and applies it to DES by replacing the notion
   of time with an event-based definition. Two notions of dissipativity are
   defined, one for finite automata and the other for a general class of
   DES. For each notion, properties of dissipative DES are shown that
   connect with existing notions of stability for DES as would be expected
   from the classical definition of dissipativity. Examples are provided to
   illustrate the methods covered in the paper.}},

Abstract = {{Sub-room-level location-based services are poised to impact people's
   daily lives in the near future. Sub-room level semantic location history
   (SLH) construction is an essential component of such services. However,
   little in-depth research on constructing SLH in sub-room-level scenarios
   has been conducted. In this paper, we propose iMiner, an automatic
   sub-room-level SLH construction system. iMiner consists of an improved
   Kalman filter-based approach to obtain accurate location and heading
   estimation from inertial sensor readings of smartphoiles. The collected
   users' location and heading histories arc further mined to estimate
   areas or interaction (AOIs). AOI is a novel idea and a powerful tool for
   accurately embedding points of interest into geographic trajectories. A
   series of experiments were conducted in two large-scale sites. The
   results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed system.}},

Abstract = {{Image feedback has become a common means to provide feedback to
   autonomous systems. However, when used in a feedback loop, acquiring and
   then processing images introduces delays in both the state feedback and
   the control input. Since the image processing time depends on the
   complexity of the image/environment, the delays can be time varying.
   Such effects can destabilize the closed-loop system. A robust control
   approach is developed in this paper which enables an autonomous system
   to track a desired trajectory despite the time-varying input and state
   delays. Lyapunov-based analysis methods are used to prove the tracking
   error is uniformly ultimately bounded, and simulation results for a
   camera-to-hand image guided sensorless missile demonstrate the
   performance of the developed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Recent results indicate that muscles have a delayed response to
   neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES). Muscle groups are known to
   rapidly fatigue in response to external muscle stimulation when compared
   to volitional contractions, and recent results indicate that this input
   delay increases as the muscle fatigues. Since the exact value of the
   time-varying input delay is difficult to measure during feedback
   control, the uncertain input delay presents a significant challenge to
   designing controllers for force tracking during isometric NMES. In the
   present work, a continuous robust controller is developed that
   compensates for the uncertain time-varying input delay for the
   uncertain, nonlinear NMES dynamics of the lower limb despite additive
   bounded disturbances. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is used to
   prove that the error signals are uniformly ultimately bounded.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of water management in an open-cathode direct methanol fuel
   cell (DMFC) is addressed in a quantitative fashion by introducing the
   definition of the scalar systemwide water management parameter, that
   characterizes whether at a given steady state the system is effectively
   losing water (hence operating under a water-discharge mode), preserving
   its water (water-balance mode), or gaining water (water-recovery mode).
   The identification of one of these three possible modes is reduced to
   analyzing the sign of the water balance parameter. A nonlinear DMFC
   system model is used to characterize the set of steady-state points that
   define a feasible region of operation where the system is under a water
   balance mode. Numerical-search algorithms are invoked to identify the
   boundaries of the feasible region. It is found that the systemwide water
   balance parameter can be manipulated by adjusting the operating
   temperature of the DMFC or the current drawn through the system;
   however, the parameter shows the specific ranges of operating
   temperature and current density where it is impossible to attain water
   balance. The feasibility regions for the DMFC system are identified, and
   used to quantify the extent to which the ambient relative humidity
   affects the region boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{A group of mobile jammers is tasked with disrupting the overall
   communication of a static radio network. The jammers are assumed to have
   limited jamming capabilities, such that the jamming effect is
   constrained to a disk area around the jammer. Radios within the jamming
   zone will be disrupted and the jamming intensity depends on the relative
   distance between the radio and the jammer. To disrupt the communication
   network, a dynamic coverage control based jamming strategy is developed,
   where the jammers coordinate their motion and cooperatively guarantee
   that every radio in the network is accumulatively disrupted up to a
   desired jamming level over time. It is further assumed that each jammer
   has a limited communication capability. Two jammers can only share
   jamming information when they stay within a certain distance. To ensure
   consistent jamming coordination, motion control laws are developed for
   jammers to perform effective jamming while preserving network
   connectivity among jammers. An appealing feature of the current work is
   the use of mobile jammers to dynamically disrupt the overall
   communication network, which enables cooperative jamming over large
   scale networks by using a limited number of mobile jammers.}},

   passivity is preserved when passive hybrid systems are connected in

   are closely related to the stability of hybrid systems. In the second
   part of this work, passivity of networked hybrid input-output automata,
   in presence of network delays is studied. The issues of both the

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider a controlled-diffusion process pertaining to
   a chain of distributed systems with random perturbations that satisfies
   a weak Hormander type condition. In particular, we consider a stochastic
   control problem with the following objectives. The first one being of a
   reachability-type that consists of determining a set of attainable
   distributions at a given time starting from an initial distribution;
   while the second one involves minimizing the relative entropy subject to
   the initial and desired final attainable distributions. Using the
   stochastic control arguments from Fleming, we provide a sufficient
   condition on the existence of an optimal admissible control for such a
   stochastic control problem which is amounted to changing the drift by a
   certain perturbation suggested by Jamison in the context of reciprocal
   processes. Moreover, such a perturbation coincides with a minimum energy
   control among all admissible controls forcing the controlled-diffusion
   process to the desired final attainable distribution starting from the
   initial distribution. Finally, we briefly remark on the invariance
   property of the path-space measure for such a diffusion process
   pertaining to the chain of distributed systems.}},

Abstract = {{Several techniques exist for dealing with spectral variability in
   hyperspectral unmixing, such as multiple end member spectral mixture
   analysis (MESMA) or compositional models. These algorithms are
   computationally very involved, and often cannot be executed on problems
   of reasonable size. In this work, we present a new algorithm for solving
   the unmixing problem when spectral variability is present. The algorithm
   uses a library-based approach to describe the variability present in
   each class, and executes an alternating optimization with respect to
   these libraries. The optimization problem itself is constructed as an
   angle minimization problem by exploiting the geometrical interpretation
   of the unmixing problem. This results in an algorithm which yields
   almost identical results as MESMA, but is computationally much more
   favorable.}},

Abstract = {{The concrete security bounds for some blockcipher-based constructions
   sometimes become worrisome or even vacuous; for example, when a
   light-weight blockcipher is used, when large amounts of data are
   processed, or when a large number of connections need to be kept secure.
   Rotating keys helps, but introduces a ``hybrid factor{''} m equal to the
   number of keys used. In such instances, analysis in the ideal-cipher
   model (ICM) can give a sharper picture of security, but this heuristic
   is called into question when cryptanalysis of the real-world blockcipher
   reveals weak keys, related-key attacks, etc.
   To address both concerns, we introduce a new analysis model, the
   ideal-cipher model under key-oblivious access (ICM-KOA). Like the ICM,
   the ICM-KOA can give sharp security bounds when standard-model bounds do
   not. Unlike the ICM, results in the ICM-KOA are less brittle to current
   and future cryptanalytic results on the blockcipher used to instantiate
   the ideal cipher. Also, results in the ICM-KOA immediately imply results
   in the ICM and the standard model, giving multiple viewpoints on a
   construction with a single effort. The ICM-KOA provides a conceptual
   bridge between ideal ciphers and tweakable blockciphers (TBC):
   blockcipher-based constructions secure in the ICM-KOA have TBC-based
   analogs that are secure under standard-model TBC security assumptions.
   Finally, the ICM-KOA provides a natural framework for analyzing
   blockcipher key-update strategies that use the blockcipher to derive the
   new key. This is done, for example, in the NIST CTR-DRBG and in the
   hardware RNG that ships on Intel chips.}},

Abstract = {{Botnets have been becoming increasingly resilient, rampant, larger and
   powerful in recent years. Going beyond traditionally malicious intents
   of stealing credentials, sending spam and DDoS, botnet herders have now
   even begun to monetize CPU cycles of zombie machines under their
   control, by illegal cryptocurrency mining. Following recent advances in
   efficient password cracking by the use of Markov chains, Context Free
   Grammar, and other methods for smart generation of candidate passwords
   for trial and error, the time taken for breaking hashed passwords has
   greatly decreased when compared to traditional brute forcing. This paper
   aims to describe the practicality of a botnet specifically designed to
   break passwords. Various modes of botnet based password breaking and the
   advantage in terms of highly accelerated hash rates obtained are
   discussed. Comparisons with hash rates of cloud-based cracking are also
   discussed. A load distribution model is shown in which workload is
   homogenously and uniformly distributed across nodes of varying computing
   power. This model is designed to be independent of the password guessing
   algorithm or combination of algorithms used. Also, the resilience of
   passwords against large search spaced brute force attacks by botnets are
   studied, and its results extrapolated to smart methods of password
   guessing.}},

Abstract = {{Large off-die stacked DRAM caches have been proposed to provide higher
   effective bandwidth and lower average latency to main memory. Designing
   a large off-die DRAM cache with conventional block size requires a large
   tag array which is impractical to fit on-die. Placing the large
   directory off-die prolong the latency since a tag access is necessary
   before the data can be accessed. This additional trip also generates
   extra off-die traffic. In this paper, we present a novel design called
   Cache Lookaside Table (CLT) to reduce the average access latency and to
   lessen off-die tag array accesses. The basic approach is to cache a
   small amount of recently referenced tags on-die. An off-die tag access
   is avoided when a requested block's tag hits a cached tag. To save
   on-die space, cached tags are recorded in a large sector for sharing
   tags with multiple blocks. However, due to the loss of one-to-one
   physical mapping of the cached tags and the data array, a way pointer is
   added for each block to indicate its way location. The proposed CLT
   exploits memory reference locality and provides a fast alternative tag
   path to capture most of the DRAM cache requests. In comparison with
   other proposed DRAM caching mechanisms, the on-die CLT approach shows an
   average performance improvement in the range of 4-15\%.}},

Abstract = {{Mesh generation difficulties can be avoided when a background mesh
   rather than a mesh that conforms to the geometry is used for the
   analysis. The geometry is represented by equations and is independent of
   the mesh and is immersed in the background mesh. The solution to
   boundary value problems is approximated or piece-wise interpolated using
   the background mesh. The main challenge is in applying the boundary
   conditions because the boundaries may not have any nodes on them.
   Implicit boundary method has been used for linear static and dynamic
   analysis and has shown to be an effective approach for imposing boundary
   conditions but has never been applied to nonlinear problems. In this
   paper, this approach is extended to large deformation nonlinear analysis
   using the Total Lagrangian formulation. The equations are solved using
   the widely used modified Newton-Raphson method with loads applied over
   many load steps. Several test examples are studied and compared with
   traditional finite element analysis software for verification.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, different approaches to parameter calibration and model
   validation were compared to understand the accuracy and robustness,
   especially when only a small number of data are available. Conventional
   one-point calibration, two point calibration, sensitivity-based
   calibration, discrepancy based calibration methods are compared when the
   number of data is less than three. An analytical example as well as a
   cantilever beam model are used to demonstrate the performance and
   accuracy of different methods. Numerical examples indicate that the
   conventional calibration method that does not account for the
   discrepancy function may lead to biased parameter and prediction models.
   It also can be seen that accurate parameter can be identified only when
   the form of discrepancy function is accurate.}},

Abstract = {{Surrogates have been used as an approximate tool to emulate simulation
   responses based on a handful of response samples. However, for high
   fidelity simulations, often only a small number samples are affordable,
   and this increases the risk of extrapolation using surrogates.
   Frequently, most of the sampling domain is not in the interpolation
   domain (called coverage), usually defined as the convex hull of these
   samples. For example, when we build a surrogate with 20 samples in six
   dimensional space, the coverage is merely 2\% of the sampling domain.
   Multi-fidelity surrogates (MFS) may mitigate this problem, because they
   use large number of low fidelity simulations, so that most of the domain
   is covered with at least some simulations.
   This paper explores the extrapolation capability of MFS frameworks
   through examples including algebraic functions. To examine the effects
   of different MFS frameworks, we consider six MFS frameworks in terms of
   their functional forms and frameworks for fitting the forms to data. We
   consider three different functional forms based on different approaches:
   1) a model discrepancy function, 2) model calibration, and 3) both.
   Bayesian MFS frameworks based on the functional forms are considered. We
   include also their counterparts in simple frameworks, which have the
   same functional form but can be built with ready-made surrogates. We
   examined the effect of the high fidelity sample coverage on
   extrapolation while the number of high fidelity samples remains the
   same. The root mean square errors (RMSE) of the interpolation and
   extrapolation domains are calculated to see their effectiveness on the
   overall RMSE of whole MFS. For the examples considered, we found that
   the presence of a regression scalar could be important to extrapolation.
   Bayesian framework isuseful to find a good regression scalar, which
   simplifies the discrepancy function.}},

Abstract = {{A 5.8 GHz radar receiver for non-contact vital sign detection system is
   designed and implemented in a TSMC CMOS 0.18 mu m process technology.
   The radar receiver integrates variable gain amplifiers and A/D
   converters on a single chip. In order to make sure the output signal is
   within the optimal dynamic range, a clutter cancellation mechanism is
   implemented in the system. Also, null points can be avoided by using I/Q
   demodulation. Experimental results show that respiration and heartbeats
   of human subjects are successfully detected in the laboratory
   environments. The overall power consumption is about 55 mW.}},
