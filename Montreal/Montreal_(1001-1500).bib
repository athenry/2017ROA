Abstract = {{Objectives Musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) are a major cause of pain,
   disability, and costs. Prevention of MSD at work is frequently described
   in terms of implementing an ergonomics program, often a participatory
   ergonomics (PE) program. Most other workplace injury prevention
   activities take place under the umbrella of a formal or informal
   occupational health and safety management system (OHSMS). This study
   assesses the similarities and differences between OHSMS and PE as such
   knowledge could help improve MSD prevention activities.
   Methods Using the internationally recognized Occupational Health and
   Safety Assessment Series (OHSAS 18001), 21 OHSMS elements were
   extracted. In order to define PE operationally, we identified the 20
   most frequently cited papers on PE and extracted content relevant to
   each of the OHSAS 18001 elements.
   Results The PE literature provided a substantial amount of detail on
   five elements: (i) hazard identification, risk assessment and
   determining controls; (ii) resources, roles, responsibility,
   accountability, and authority; (iii) competence, training and awareness;
   (iv) participation and consultation; and (v) performance measurement and
   monitoring. However, of the 21 OHSAS elements, the PE literature was
   silent on 8 and provided few details on 8 others.
   Conclusions The PE literature did not speak to many elements described
   in OHSMS and even when it did, the language used was often different.
   This may negatively affect the effectiveness and sustainability of PE
   initiatives within organizations. It is expected that paying attention
   to the approaches and language used in management system frameworks
   could make prevention of MSD activities more effective and sustainable.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a method is proposed to generate scanning paths to be
   used in automated abrasive waterjet polishing of free-form surfaces.
   This method is able to produce trajectories with constant offset
   distance between curves on surfaces with holes and complex boundaries
   without reconfiguration of their triangular mesh model. For this, the
   particular requirements of this polishing technique to be kept along the
   path are investigated. Next, a reference curve is obtained and using
   geodesic distances in specific directions, the adjacent offset curves
   are found. Finally, if needed, the main trajectory is divided into a set
   of continuous sub-trajectories. By defining two indices, the effect of
   the shape of the surface and the configuration of the generated path on
   the uniformity of the distribution of the waterjet is evaluated. Through
   several examples, it is shown that the method can effectively generate
   scanning paths adapted to the requirements of this technique.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The effect of dry grinding on the morphology and structure of kaolin
   particles treated with potassium acetate (KAc) and dimethyl sulfoxide
   (DMSO) has been investigated. After treatment with KAc, the d-spacing of
   kaolin increased from 0.72 to 1.03, 1.30, and 1.38 nm due to the
   combined effects of humidity and orientation of KAc molecules. The
   d-spacing was increased to 1.13 nm in the case of DMSO treatment. A
   combination of XRD, TGA, and FT-IR showed that the crystalline structure
   of kaolin-DMSO and kaolin-KAc were significantly altered by grinding.
   The intensity of XRD diffraction peaks of ground samples was decreased
   due to the deterioration of the crystalline structure, and for longer
   grinding times those peaks almost disappeared. After grinding, the
   dehydroxylation temperature generally shifted to lower values and a
   smaller weight loss was observed. The variations of particle size and
   surface characteristics were also investigated. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Autonomous robot networks are an effective tool for monitoring
   large-scale environmental fields. This paper proposes distributed
   control strategies for localizing the source of a noisy signal, which
   could represent a physical quantity of interest such as magnetic force,
   heat, radio signal, or chemical concentration. We develop algorithms
   specific to two scenarios: one in which the sensors have a precise model
   of the signal formation process and one in which a signal model is not
   available. In the model-free scenario, a team of sensors is used to
   follow a stochastic gradient of the signal field. Our approach is
   distributed, robust to deformations in the group geometry, does not
   necessitate global localization, and is guaranteed to lead the sensors
   to a neighborhood of a local maximum of the field. In the model-based
   scenario, the sensors follow a stochastic gradient of the mutual
   information (MI) between their expected measurements and the expected
   source location in a distributed manner. The performance is demonstrated
   in simulation using a robot sensor network to localize the source of a

Abstract = {{Timing problems involve the choice of task execution dates within a
   predetermined processing sequence, and under various additional
   constraints or objectives such as time windows, time-dependent costs, or
   flexible processing times, among others. Their efficient resolution is
   critical in branch and bound and neighborhood search methods for vehicle
   routing, project and machine scheduling, as well as in various
   applications in network optimization, resource allocation, and
   statistical inference. Timing-related problems have been studied for
   years, yet research on this subject suffers from a lack of consensus,
   and most knowledge is scattered among operations research and applied
   mathematics domains. This article introduces a classification of timing
   problems and features, as well as a unifying multidisciplinary analysis
   of timing algorithms. In relation to frequent application cases within
   branching schemes or neighborhood searches, the efficient resolution of
   series of similar timing subproblems is also analyzed. A dedicated
   formalism of reoptimization by concatenation is introduced to that
   extent. The knowledge developed through this analysis is valuable for
   modeling and algorithmic design, for a wide range of combinatorial
   optimization problems with time characteristics, including rich vehicle
   routing settings and emerging nonregular scheduling applications, among
   others. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. NETWORKS, Vol. 65(2), 102-128

Abstract = {{In this paper, we address the problem of estimating the two-dimensional
   (2-D) directions of arrival (DOA) of multiple signals, by means of a
   sparse L-shaped array. The array consists of one uniform linear array
   (ULA) and one sparse linear array (SLA). The shift-invariance property
   of the ULA is used to estimate the elevation angles with low
   computational burden. The signal subspace is constructed by the
   cross-covariance matrix (CCM) of the received data without implementing
   eigendecomposition. The source waveforms are then obtained by the
   estimated elevation angles, which together with each sensor of the SLA,
   considered as a linear regression model, is used to estimate the azimuth
   angle by the modified total least squares (MTLS) technique. Our new
   algorithm yields correct parameter pairs without requiring the
   computationally expensive pairing operation, and therefore, has at least
   two advantages over the previous L-shaped array based algorithms: less
   computational load and better performance due to the use of SLA and CCM.
   Expressions for the asymptotic mean-squared error (MSE) of the 2-D DOA
   estimates are derived. Simulation results show that our method provides
   accurate and consistent 2-D DOA estimation results that could not be
   obtained by the existing methods with comparable computational
   complexity.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents an analysis of climate change impacts on a large
   river located in Quebec (Canada) used as a drinking water source.
   Combined sewer overflow (CSO) effluents are the primary source of fecal
   contamination of the river. An analysis of river flowrates was conducted
   using historical data and predicted flows from a future climate
   scenario. A spatio-temporal analysis of water quality trends with regard
   to fecal contamination was performed and the effects of changing
   flowrates on the dilution of fecal contaminants were analyzed. Along the
   river, there was a significant spatial trend for increasing fecal
   pollution downstream of CSO outfalls. Escherichia colt concentrations
   (upper 95th percentile) increased linearly from 2002 to 2012 at one
   drinking water treatment plant intake. Two critical periods in the
   current climate were identified for the drinking water intakes
   considering both potential contaminant loads and flowrates: local spring
   snowmelt that precedes river peak flow and extra-tropical storm events
   that occur during low flows. Regionally, climate change is expected to
   increase the intensity of the impacts of hydrological conditions on
   water quality in the studied basin. Based on climate projections, it is
   expected that spring snowmelt will occur earlier and extreme spring
   flowrates will increase and low flows will generally decrease. High and
   low flows are major factors related to the potential degradation of
   water quality of the river. However, the observed degradation of water
   quality over the past 10 years suggests that urban development and
   population growth may have played a greater role than climate. However,
   climate change impacts will likely be observed over a longer period.
   Source water protection plans should consider climate change impacts on
   the dilution of contaminants in addition to local land uses changes in
   order to maintain or improve water quality. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Volume = {{121}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Real-time health monitoring of structures made of laminated composites
   is necessary as significant damage may occur without any visible signs
   on the surface. Inspection by electrical tomography (ET) seems a viable
   approach that relies on voltage measurements from a network of
   electrodes across the inspected domain to infer conductivity change
   within the bulk material. If conductivity decreases significantly with
   increasing damage, the obtained conductivity map can be correlated to
   the degradation state of the material. We focus here on detection of
   transverse cracks. As transverse cracks modify the in-plane transverse
   conductivity of a single ply, we expect them to be detectable by
   electrical measurements. Yet, the quality of detection is directly
   related to the sensitivity of the measurements to the presence of
   cracks. We use numerical experiments to demonstrate that the sensitivity
   depends on several material and geometrical parameters. Based on the
   results, the applicability of ET to detect transverse cracks is
   discussed. One conclusion from the study is that detecting transverse
   cracks using ET is more reliable in some laminate configurations than in
   others. Recommendations about the properties of either the pristine
   material or the inspected structures are provided to establish if ET is
   reliable in detecting transverse cracks. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {{55}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider tactical planning for a class of multi-period
   vehicle routing problems (MPVRP). This problem involves optimizing daily
   product collections from several production locations over a given
   planning horizon. In this context, a single routing plan for the whole
   horizon must be prepared, and the seasonal variations in the producers'
   supplies must be taken into account. Production variations over the
   horizon are approximated using a sequence of periods, each corresponding
   to a production season, while the intra-period variations are neglected.
   We propose a mathematical model that is based on the two-stage a priori
   optimization paradigm. The first stage corresponds to the design of a
   plan which, in the second stage, takes the different periods into
   account. The proposed set partitioning-based formulation is solved using
   a branch-and-price approach. The subproblem is a multi-period elementary
   shortest path problem with resource constraints (MPESPPRC), for which we
   propose an adaptation of the dynamic-programming-based label-correcting
   algorithm. Computational results show that this approach is able to
   solve instances with up to 60 producers and five periods. (C) 2014

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{143}},
Pages = {{253-261}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Mobile reservoirs heat bitumen to temperature exceeding 240 degrees C
   thereby reducing the viscosity to pump and make it easier to spread to
   seal roof tops. Aerosols, vapors and gases evolve at this temperature
   but more fumes are generated at the surface of the burner where it
   exceeds 300 degrees C; these fumes represent a safety hazard. The
   Cleveland open cup flash point was 320 degrees C and the Pensky-Martens
   closed cup flash point was 310 degrees C for the bitumen tested. Based
   on thermo-gravimetric analysis, bitumen pyrolysis occurs in three
   stages. A first fraction (35\%) evolves at 250 degrees C, a second
   fraction (65\%) releases at 350 degrees C and finally a third fraction
   (5\%) at 400 degrees C, with activation energies of 52 kJ mol (1), 132
   kJ mol (1) and 228 kJ mol (1), respectively. Increasing the heating rate
   shifts the thermo-gravimetric curve towards higher temperature and
   raises the maximum decomposition rate. We attribute the shift in the
   curve to heat and mass transfer resistance between the bitumen surface
   and the inert gas flow. The heat transfer coefficient between the gas
   phase and the liquid in the crucible varies from 10 W m (2) K (1) to 20
   W m (2) K (1), which was estimated by evaporating a solution of
   glycerine and isobutanol. These ideal compounds were chosen to derive
   the heat and mass transfer rates, which we applied to the bitumen
   experimental data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The near-surface hardness and residual stresses resulting from a single
   shot peening impingement on aluminum alloy 2024-T351 were assessed by
   nanoindentation with spatial mapping of mechanical properties on cross
   sections through an impingement. For residual stress, a procedure was
   developed to couple nanoindentation experiments with numerical
   simulations for better understanding and predicting the effects of shot
   peening. A surface preparation method was developed that exposes the
   cross section of a single shot impingement for nanoindentation tests,
   while at the same time obtaining accurate measurements of the
   impingement dimensions. Starting parameters for the numerical simulation
   in terms of shot diameter and the shot velocity were selected to best
   match measurements of the impingement depth and diameter. The
   experimental results indicated that the greatest hardness was located at
   the nearest indent to the peened surface, whereas the maximum
   compressive residual stress was located sub-surface. When comparing
   experimental and numerical residual stresses, the experimental results
   showed a greater maximum compressive residual stress that was in closer
   proximity to the peened surface. Overall, residual stress fields
   compared between experimental and numerical results were similar, and
   differences could be explained in terms of the effect of strain
   hardening. The current work demonstrated the usefulness of coupling
   nanoindentation experiments with numerical simulations for evaluating
   the surface modifications resulting from a single shot peening
   impingement.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel method for face-recognition based on leveraging weak
   or noisily labeled data. We combine facial images from the Labeled Faces
   in the Wild (LFW) dataset with face images extracted from videos on
   YouTube and face images returned using a search engine. Our technique is
   based on a novel formulation for weakly supervised learning based on
   probabilistic graphical models using a margin-like property and a null
   category. As such, our formulation remains within a fully probabilistic
   framework. We use this technique to combine high accuracy human labeled
   data with noisily labeled data. We present a specific variation of our
   general approach using a model inspired by the relevance vector machine
   (RVM), a probabilistic alternative to support vector machines. In
   contrast to previous formulations of RVMs we show how the choice of an
   exponential hyperprior produces an approximation to the L-1 penalty. We
   present both experiments where we simulate noisy labels and experiments
   where we use image and video search results as noisily labeled data.
   Faces extracted from the resulting Youtube videos thus are likely, but
   not assured to contain examples of the person whose name was given as
   the query. We show how our probabilistic margin approach provides a
   robust way to combine labeled LFW data with this type of noisy search
   result. Our results indicate that recognition performance can indeed be
   increased consistently with weakly labeled data using our technique. (C)

Abstract = {{Spine stability demand influences active-passive coordination of the
   trunk response, especially during sudden perturbations. The objective of
   this study was to look at the role of passive, stationary active and
   reflexive subsystems on spinal stability. Spine stability was evaluated
   here during pre- and post-perturbation phases by computing the minimum
   (i.e., critical) muscle stiffness coefficient required to maintain
   stability. The effects of pre-perturbation conditions (preloading,
   initial posture and abdominal antagonistic coactivation) as well as
   perturbation magnitude were studied. Results revealed that higher
   preload, initially flexed trunk posture and abdominal pre-activation
   enhanced pre-perturbation stiffness and stability. In contrast to the
   preload, however, larger sudden load, initial flexion and abdominal
   preactivation significantly increased post-perturbation stability
   margin. As a result, much lower critical muscle stiffness coefficient
   was required post-perturbation. Compared to the pre-perturbation phase,
   the trunk stiffness and stability substantially increased
   post-perturbation demanding thus a much lower critical muscle stiffness
   coefficient. Overall, these findings highlight the crucial role of the
   ligamentous spine and muscles (in both passive and active states) in
   augmenting the trunk stiffness and hence stability during pre- and
   post-perturbation phases; a role much evident in the presence of initial
   trunk flexion. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast is widely used in
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies aimed at
   investigating neuronal activity. However, the BOLD signal reflects
   changes in blood volume and oxygenation rather than neuronal activity
   per se. Therefore, understanding the transformation of microscopic
   vascular behavior into macroscopic BOLD signals is at the foundation of
   physiologically informed noninvasive neuroimaging. Here, we use
   oxygen-sensitive two-photon microscopy to measure the BOLD-relevant
   microvascular physiology occurring within a typical rodent fMRI voxel
   and predict the BOLD signal from first principles using those
   measurements. The predictive power of the approach is illustrated by
   quantifying variations in the BOLD signal induced by the morphological
   folding of the human cortex. This framework is then used to quantify the
   contribution of individual vascular compartments and other factors to
   the BOLD signal for different magnet strengths and pulse sequences.}},

Abstract = {{Emulsification experiments were performed in an unbaffled tank using an
   off-centered pitched-blade turbine. The effects of mixing time, particle
   concentration, impeller speed, and oil viscosity on the production of
   Pickering emulsions were investigated. Emulsification efficiency was
   quantified by size distribution measurements using a Mastersizer 3000
   (Malvern). Mixing and circulation times were measured using a
   decolorization technique to investigate the effect of impeller speed on
   the stabilization process. There was a strong interaction among all the
   parameters affecting mixing tank hydrodynamics. Optimal conditions were
   determined in order to produce the smallest droplets with the narrowest
   distribution. Droplet production and coverage were involved
   simultaneously in the interaction, which is very different from
   surfactant-based systems where the stabilization step is much faster
   than the droplet production step and where droplet breakage is promoted
   by reducing the interfacial tension. The impeller speed and
   emulsification time results indicated that the shear level in the
   impeller zone, the energy dissipation rate, and the fluid circulation
   time are important drivers of the stabilization mechanism. The particle
   concentration results showed that the particle effect played a role in
   the production of an interface and in stabilization efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{We report for the first time the characterization of glass-ceramics for

   oxyfluoride glass matrix of composition
   2YbF(3):30SiO(2)-15Al(2)O(3)-25CdF(2)-22PbF(2)-4YF(3), forming bulk
   glass-ceramics at three different crystalisation levels. The samples are
   compared with a corresponding uncrystalised (glass) sample, as well as a
   Yb:YAG sample which has presented optical cooling. The measured X-ray
   diffraction spectra, and thermal capacities of the samples are reported.
   We also report for the first time the use of Yb: YAG as a reference for
   absolute photometric quantum efficiency measurement, and use the same
   setup to characterize the glass and glass-ceramic samples. The cooling
   figure-of-merit was measured by optical calorimetry using a fiber Bragg
   grating and found to depend on the level of crystallization of the
   sample, and that samples with nanocrystallites result in higher quantum
   efficiency and lower background absorption than the pure-glass sample.
   In addition to laser-induced cooling, the glass-ceramics have the
   potential to serve as a reference for quantum efficiency measurements.

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{114}},

Month = {{FEB 20}},
Abstract = {{We experimentally demonstrate the possibility of tuning the frequency of
   a laser pulse via the use of an Airy pulse-seeded soliton self-frequency
   shift. The intrinsically asymmetric nature of Airy pulses, typically
   featured by either leading or trailing oscillatory tails (relatively to
   the main lobe), is revealed through the nonlinear generation of both a
   primary and a secondary Raman soliton self-frequency shift, a phenomenon
   which is driven by the soliton fission processes. The resulting
   frequency shift can be carefully controlled by using time-reversed Airy
   pulses or, alternatively, by applying an offset to the cubic phase
   modulation used to generate the pulses. When compared with the use of
   conventional chirped Gaussian pulses, our technique brings about unique
   advantages in terms of both efficient frequency tuning and feasibility,
   along with the generation and control of multicolor Raman solitons with
   enhanced tunability. Our theoretical analysis agrees well with our
   experimental observations.}},

Abstract = {{Given a directed graph with weights on the vertices and on the arcs, a
   theta-improper k-coloring is an assignment of at most k different colors
   to the vertices of G such that the weight of every vertex nu is greater,
   by a given factor 1/theta, than the sum of the weights on the arcs (u,
   nu) entering nu with the tail u of the same color as nu. For a given
   real number theta, we consider the problem of determining the minimum
   integer k such that G has a theta-improper k-coloring. Also, for a given
   integer k, we consider the problem of determining the minimum real
   number 0 such that G has a theta-improper k-coloring. We show that these
   two problems can be used to model channel allocation problems in
   wireless communication networks, when it is required that the power of
   the signal received at a base station is greater, by a given factor,
   than the sum of interfering powers received from mobiles which are
   assigned the same channel. We propose set partitioning formulations for
   both problems and describe branch-and-price algorithms to solve them.
   Computational experiments are reported for instances having a similar
   structure as real channel allocation problems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Higher levels of cardiovascular fitness are associated with better
   executive function and prefrontal oxygenation in younger and older women}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{FEB 18}},
Abstract = {{Aim: Many studies have suggested that physical exercise training
   improves cognition and more selectively executive functions. There is a
   growing interest to clarify the neurophysiological mechanisms that
   underlie this effect. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the
   neurophysiological changes in cerebral oxygenation associated with
   physical fitness level and executive functions.
   Method: In this study, 22 younger and 36 older women underwent a maximal
   graded continuous test (i.e., (V)over dotO(2max)) in order to classify
   them into a fitness group (higher vs. lower fit). All participants
   completed neuropsychological paper and pencil testing and a computerized
   Stroop task (which contained executive and non-executive conditions) in
   which the change in prefrontal cortex oxygenation was evaluated with
   near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).
   Results: Our findings revealed a Fitness x Condition interaction (p <
   0.05) such that higher fit women scored better on measures of executive
   functions than lower fit women. In comparison to lower fit women, higher
   fit women had faster reaction times in the Executive condition of the
   computerized Stroop task. No significant effect was observed in the
   non-executive condition of the test and no interactions were found with
   age. In measures of cerebral oxygenation (Delta HbT and Delta HbO(2)),
   we found a main effect of fitness on cerebral oxygenation during the
   Stroop task such that only high fit women demonstrated a significant
   increase in the right inferior frontal gyrus.
   Discussion/Conclusion: Higher fit individuals who demonstrate better
   cardiorespiratory functions (as measured by ((V)over dotO(2max)) show
   faster reaction times and greater cerebral oxygenation in the right
   inferior frontal gyrus than women with lower fitness levels. The lack of
   interaction with age, suggests that good cardiorespiratory functions can
   have a positive impact on cognition, regardless of age.}},

Volume = {{108}},
Pages = {{67-78}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{In present study, a hybrid finite element method is applied to
   investigate the free vibration of spherical shell filled with fluid. The
   structural model is based on a combination of thin shell theory and the
   classical finite element method. It is assumed that the fluid is
   incompressible and has no free-surface effect. Fluid is considered as a
   velocity potential variable at each node of the shell element where its
   motion is expressed in terms of nodal elastic displacement at the
   fluid-structure interface. Numerical simulation is done and vibration
   frequencies for different filling ratios are obtained and compared with
   existing experimental and theoretical results. The dynamic behavior for
   different shell geometries, filling ratios and boundary conditions with
   different radius to thickness ratios is summarized. This proposed hybrid
   finite element method can be used efficiently for analyzing the dynamic
   behavior of aerospace structures at less computational cost than other
   commercial FEM software. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{98}},

Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{A knowledge of the physical properties of materials as a function of
   temperature, composition, applied external stresses, etc. is an
   important consideration in materials and process design. For new
   systems, such properties may be unknown and hard to measure or estimate
   from numerical simulations such as molecular dynamics. Engineers rely on
   machine learning to employ existing data in order to predict properties
   for new systems. Several techniques are currently used for such
   purposes. These include neural network, polynomial interpolation and
   Gaussian processes as well as the more recent dynamic trees and scalable
   Gaussian processes. In this paper we compare these approaches for three
   sets of materials sciences data: molar volume, electrical conductivity
   and Martensite start temperature. We make recommendations depending on
   the nature of the data. We demonstrate that a thorough knowledge of the
   problem beforehand is critical in selecting the most successful machine
   learning technique. Our findings show that the Gaussian process
   regression technique gives very good predictions for all three sets of
   tested data. Typically, Gaussian process is very slow with a
   computational complexity of typically n(3) where n is the number of data
   points. In this paper, we found that the scalable Gaussian process
   approach was able to maintain the high accuracy of the predictions while
   improving speed considerably, make on-line learning possible. (C) 2014

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{601}},
Pages = {{54-62}},
Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{Engineered fuels (EF) manufactured from waste can be an advantageous
   substitute for coal or other fossil fuel in (co-)combustion,
   gasification or pyrolysis processes. Unfortunately, because of their
   heterogeneity, the thermal behavior of such fuels can often be complex,
   limiting their application. In the present study, the pyrolysis of a
   heterogeneous commercial EF composed of fibers and plastics was
   investigated using a TGA apparatus over a large range of heating rates
   (from 5 to 400 degrees C/min). At a heating rate of 5 degrees C/min, the
   EF devolatilization curve was simply a proportional sum of the
   devolatilization curves of its individual components. When the heating
   rate was increased up to 100 degrees C/min, however, a shift in the
   devolatilization TG curve of the fibers, plastics and EF to higher
   temperatures was observed as a consequence of heat transfer limitations
   within samples. Furthermore, differences between the proportional sum of
   the devolatilization curves of the individual components of the EF and
   its experimental curve were observed, and increased with increasing
   heating rates up to 400 degrees C/min. A model was developed to correct
   for heat transfer limitations by considering thermal phenomena such as
   heat transfer limitations between the TGA and the sample, change in
   sample heat capacity and effect of endothermic reactions on sample
   temperature. This model predicted the shift of EF devolatilization
   towards higher temperature with increasing heating rates, which suggests
   that no significant chemical effects occurred between the EF components.

   study this phenomena. The model is first applied and validated on a

   assuming a mass eccentricity of 10\% of the building dimension (ESP);
   (2) Response Spectrum Analysis with static torsional moments based on
   10\% of the building dimension (RSA-10); and (3) Response Spectrum
   Analysis with the CM being displaced by 5\% of the building dimension
   (RSA-5). Time history analyses were performed under a set of eleven
   two-component historical records. The analyses showed that the ESP and
   RSA-10 methods can give appropriate results for all three levels of
   torsional sensitivity. When using the RSA-5 method, adequate performance
   was also achieved for the low and intermediate torsional sensitivity
   cases, but the method led to excessive displacements (5-10\% storey
   drifts), near collapse state, for the highly torsionally sensitive
   structures. These results support the current provisions of NBCC 2010.}},

Abstract = {{Treadmill walking is commonly used to analyze several gait cycles in a
   limited space. Depth cameras, such as the low-cost and easy-to-use
   Kinect sensor, look promising for gait analysis on a treadmill for
   routine outpatient clinics. However, gait analysis is based on
   accurately detecting gait events (such as heel-strike) by tracking the
   feet which may be incorrectly recognized with Kinect. Indeed depth
   images could lead to confusion between the ground and the feet around
   the contact phase. To tackle this problem we assume that heel-strike
   events could be indirectly estimated by searching for extreme values of
   the distance between knee joints along the walking longitudinal axis. To
   evaluate this assumption, the motion of 11 healthy subjects walking on a
   treadmill was recorded using both an optoelectronic system and Kinect.
   The measures were compared to reference heel-strike events obtained with
   vertical foot velocity. When using the optoelectronic system to assess
   knee joints, heel-strike estimation errors were very small (29 +/- 18
   ms) leading to small cycle durations errors (0 +/- 15 ms). To locate
   knees in depth map (Kinect), we used anthropometrical data to select the
   body point located at a constant height where the knee should be based
   on a reference posture. This Kinect approach gave heel-strike errors of
   17 +/- 24 ms (mean cycle duration error: 0 +/- 12 ms). Using this same
   anthropometric methodology with optoelectronic data, the heel-strike
   error was 12 +/- 12 ms (mean cycle duration error: 0 +/- 11 ms).
   Compared to previous studies using Kinect, heel-strike and gait cycles
   were more accurately estimated, which could improve clinical gait
   analysis with such sensor. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A good understanding of the factors impacting defects in software
   systems is essential for software practitioners, because it helps them
   prioritize quality improvement efforts (e.g., testing and code reviews).
   Defect prediction models are typically built using classification or
   regression analysis on product and/or process metrics collected at a
   single point in time (e.g., a release date). However, current defect
   prediction models only predict if a defect will occur, but not when,
   which makes the prioritization of software quality improvements efforts
   difficult. To address this problem, Koru et al. applied survival
   analysis techniques to a large number of software systems to study how
   size (i.e., lines of code) influences the probability that a source code
   module (e.g., class or file) will experience a defect at any given time.
   Given that 1) the work of Koru et al. has been instrumental to our
   understanding of the size-defect relationship, 2) the use of survival
   analysis in the context of defect modelling has not been well studied
   and 3) replication studies are an important component of balanced
   scholarly debate, we present a replication study of the work by Koru et
   al. In particular, we present the details necessary to use survival
   analysis in the context of defect modelling (such details were missing
   from the original paper by Koru et al.). We also explore how differences
   between the traditional domains of survival analysis (i.e., medicine and
   epidemiology) and defect modelling impact our understanding of the
   size-defect relationship. Practitioners and researchers considering the
   use of survival analysis should be aware of the implications of our
   findings.}},

Title = {{Quantifying the determinants of outbreak detection performance through

Abstract = {{Objective: To develop a probabilistic model for discovering and
   quantifying determinants of outbreak detection and to use the model to
   predict detection performance for new outbreaks.
   Materials and methods: We used an existing software platform to simulate
   waterborne disease outbreaks of varying duration and magnitude. The
   simulated data were overlaid on real data from visits to emergency
   department in Montreal for gastroenteritis. We analyzed the combined
   data using biosurveillance algorithms, varying their parameters over a
   wide range. We then applied structure and parameter learning algorithms
   to the resulting data set to build a Bayesian network model for
   predicting detection performance as a function of outbreak
   characteristics and surveillance system parameters. We evaluated the
   predictions of this model through 5-fold cross-validation.
   Results: The model predicted performance metrics of commonly used
   outbreak detection methods with an accuracy greater than 0.80. The model
   also quantified the influence of different outbreak characteristics and
   parameters of biosurveillance algorithms on detection performance in
   practically relevant surveillance scenarios. In addition to identifying
   characteristics expected a priori to have a strong influence on
   detection performance, such as the alerting threshold and the peak size
   of the outbreak, the model suggested an important role for other
   algorithm features, such as adjustment for weekly patterns.
   Conclusion: We developed a model that accurately predicts how
   characteristics of disease outbreaks and detection methods will
   influence on detection. This model can be used to compare the
   performance of detection methods under different surveillance scenarios,
   to gain insight into which characteristics of outbreaks and
   biosurveillance algorithms drive detection performance, and to guide the
   configuration of surveillance systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The mechanisms of transfer of sulfur to the volatile phase and char
   phase during the pyrolysis of tires have been investigated by
   complementing the available literature data with TGA experiments. For
   isothermal experiments, the global selectivity expression could be
   simplified into an intrinsic form of sulfur loss selectivity, which is
   solely a function of temperature. Two other phenomena have been found to
   influence the intrinsic sulfur loss selectivity: solid matrix
   desulfurization and metals sulfidation. In the case where tires would
   contain no metals and pyrolysis was performed at a temperature of 400
   degrees C or higher, decomposition kinetics is limiting and the
   intrinsic sulfur loss selectivity would converge to the value of 1.
   Below 350 degrees C, mass transfer limitation will promote solid matrix
   desulfurization, producing sulfur loss selectivity greater than 1. Over
   350 degrees C, if zinc and/or steel are present in tires, sulfidation
   will cluster sulfur in the solid phase and sulfur loss selectivity will
   become lower than 1. A developed form of sulfur loss selectivity could
   be obtained to account for these phenomena.}},

Abstract = {{A differential measurement technique for extracting the complex

   rough conductor surface is proposed in this paper. In this method,
   substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) cavity resonators having the same

   loss of the top and bottom surfaces of SIW cavity resonators. The
   extraction of effective conductivity from the surfaces of SIW cavities
   is done through examining the difference of unloaded Q-factors between
   the SIW cavity resonators with varied thicknesses. In advance of getting
   knowledge of the dielectric loss of substrate material, the conductor
   loss contributed by the metallic via array must be characterized. The
   separation between the conductor loss of metallic via array and
   dielectric loss of substrate material is done through the analysis and
   comparison of unloaded Q-factors between the SIW cavity resonators with
   the same length but different widths. In order to verify the proposed

Abstract = {{PurposeTo validate semiautomated spinal cord segmentation in healthy
   subjects and patients with neurodegenerative diseases and trauma.
   Materials and MethodsForty-nine healthy subjects, as well as 29 patients
   with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 19 with spinal muscular atrophy, and
   14 with spinal cord injuries were studied. Cord area was measured from
   T-2-weighted 3D turbo spin echo images (cord levels from C2 to T9) using
   the semiautomated segmentation method of Losseff et al (Brain {[}1996]
   119(Pt 3):701-708), compared with manual segmentation. Reproducibility
   was evaluated using the inter- and intraobserver coefficient of
   variation (CoV). Accuracy was assessed using the Dice similarity
   coefficient (DSC). Robustness to initialization was assessed by
   simulating modifications to the contours drawn manually prior to
   segmentation.
   ResultsMean interobserver CoV was 4.00\% for manual segmentation (1.90\%
   for Losseff's method) in the cervical region and 5.62\% (respectively
   2.19\%) in the thoracic region. Mean intraobserver CoV was 2.34\% for
   manual segmentation (1.08\% for Losseff's method) in the cervical region
   and 2.35\% (respectively 1.34\%) in the thoracic region. DSC was high
   (0.96) in both cervical and thoracic regions. DSC remained higher than
   0.8 even when modifying initial contours by 50\%.
   ConclusionThe semiautomated segmentation method showed high
   reproducibility and accuracy in measuring spinal cord area. J. Magn.

Abstract = {{This study investigates the tectono-metamorphic history and exhumation
   mechanisms of the mid-crustal Mekinac-Taureau domain of the Mauricie
   area, central Grenville Province. Macro- and micro-structural analyses
   reveal the top-down-to-the-ESE sense of shear on the eastern Taureau
   shear zone, a major extensional structure that exhumed the mid-crustal
   Mekinac-Taureau domain and juxtaposed it against the lower grade rocks
   of the Shawinigan domain. Peak metamorphism in the Mekinac-Taureau
   domain, inferred to be the result of northwestward thrusting and
   regional crustal thickening, took place under P-T conditions of
   1000-1100 MPa and 820-880 degrees C prior to 1082 +/- 20 Ma. Retrograde
   conditions varying from 775 to 675 degrees C and from 800 to 650 MPa
   were registered in its upper structural levels prior to and/or during
   shearing along the eastern Taureau shear zone that was active at 1064
   +/- 15 Ma. The Shawinigan domain records P-T conditions ranging from 850
   to 625 MPa and from 775 to 700 degrees C, P-T values that are similar to
   or slightly lower than those for retrogressed samples from the upper
   structural levels of the Mekinac-Taureau domain, but clearly lower than
   the peak metamorphism values of the latter domain. Finally, the area
   cooled below 550-600 degrees C at similar to 1000-1030 Ma and below 450
   degrees C at similar to 900-970 Ma on the basis of Ar-40/Ar-39
   geochronology on amphibole and biotite. Structural and metamorphic
   characteristics of the Mauricie area are similar to those expected from
   a metamorphic core complex formed during post-convergence orogenic
   collapse in a gravity-driven fixed-boundary mode. The Mekinac-Taureau
   and Shawinigan domains were thus probably exhumed by a similar process,
   which supports the orogenic collapse model recently proposed to explain
   the exhumation of mid-crustal metamorphic core complexes in the
   Grenville Province. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To assess the ability to control the steering of a modified
   guidewire actuated by the magnetic force of a magnetic resonance imaging
   system with additional gradient coils for selective arterial
   catheterization in rabbits.
   Methods: Selective catheterizations of the right renal artery, left
   renal artery, superior mesenteric artery, and iliac artery were
   performed on two rabbits. A 3D magnetic force was applied onto a
   magnetic bead placed at the tip of a guidewire. The ability of the
   guidewire to advance in the aorta without entering the side branches
   when the magnetic force was not applied was also evaluated. Steering of
   the guidewire was combined with a dedicated tracking system and its
   position was registered on the 3D model of a magnetic resonance
   angiography (MRA).
   Results: The magnetic catheterization of the renal arteries was
   successful and showed reproducibility. Superior mesenteric artery and
   iliac artery showed that the catheterization was feasible. These two
   arteries were difficult to visualize on MRA, making catheterization and
   setting the direction of the force more difficult. There was no
   inadvertent catheterization of side vessels when the guidewire was
   advanced with magnetic steering despite the hook shape at the tip of the
   guidewire caused by the alignment of the bead anisotropy with the
   permanent magnetic field.
   Conclusions: This first evaluation of selective catheterization of
   aortic branches with a magnetic guidewire provided a successful steering
   in the less angled side branches and this modified guidewire was
   advanced in the aorta without inadvertent selective catheterization when
   manipulated without magnetic actuation. (C) 2015 American Association of

Abstract = {{A method is proposed to evaluate implicit sensitivity coefficients for

   cases. The precision of the method, the importance of the implicit
   coefficients with respect to the total sensitivity, and the
   contributions of all the isotopes are discussed and compared for the
   different systems. We also show how to compute the sensitivity
   coefficients in the unresolved energy groups, where the details of the
   resonances are not known. An equivalent dilution model is used for the
   self-shielding calculations. Complete transport calculations, using a

Abstract = {{In recent years, many companies have realized that collaboration with a
   thriving user or developer community is a major factor in creating
   innovative technology driven by market demand. As a result, businesses
   have sought ways to stimulate contributions from developers outside
   their corporate walls, and integrate external developers into their
   development process. To support software companies in this process, this
   paper presents an empirical study on the contribution management
   processes of two major, successful, open source software ecosystems. We
   contrast a for-profit (ANDROID) system having a hybrid contribution
   style, with a not-for-profit (LINUX kernel) system having an open
   contribution style. To guide our comparisons, we base our analysis on a
   conceptual model of contribution management that we derived from a total
   of seven major open-source software systems. A quantitative comparison
   based on data mined from the ANDROID code review system and the LINUX
   kernel code review mailing lists shows that both projects have
   significantly different contribution management styles, suited to their
   respective market goals, but with individual advantages and
   disadvantages that are important for practitioners. Contribution
   management is a real-world problem that has received very little
   attention from the research community so far. Both studied systems
   (LINUX and ANDROID) employ different strategies and techniques for
   managing contributions, and both approaches are valuable examples for
   practitioners. Each approach has specific advantages and disadvantages
   that need to be carefully evaluated by practitioners when adopting a
   contribution management process in practice.}},

Abstract = {{The >2000-km-long Indus-Tsangpo suture zone (ITSZ) in southern Tibet
   contains remnants of Neotethyan oceanic lithosphere, ophiolitic
   melanges, flysch units and continental rocks, and has been interpreted
   as the boundary between the India and Eurasia plates. We have used
   field-based structural analyses and geological mapping in five key
   ophiolite massifs (Luobusa, Zedang, Xigaze, Jiding and Dongbo) and
   petrofabric studies of core samples recovered through the Luobusa
   Scientific Drilling Project to document the structural architecture and
   the deformation history of the ITSZ. The structural and kinematic
   analyses of the suture zone units indicate the occurrence of superposed
   deformation fabrics, which developed first during the ophiolite
   emplacement and then during the subsequent India-Asia continental
   collision. The suprasubduction zone ophiolites were emplaced southward
   onto the northern margin of the proto-Indian plate in the late
   Cretaceous. The continental collision between the ophiolite-laden
   proto-Indian margin and the Lhasa terrane of the Eurasian plate in the
   early Paleogene resulted in backthrusting and inversion of the
   structural order of the ITSZ. The ophiolite massifs, ophiolitic melanges
   and flysch units were thrust northward as nappe sheets over the Eocene
   and younger forearc basin strata. The ITSZ shows, therefore, a complex
   structural anatomy characterized by both south and north-directed thrust
   faults, and ductile and brittle deformation fabrics. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{We present a tactical wood flow model that appears in the context of the
   Canadian forestry industry, and describe the implementation of a
   decision support system created for use by an industrial partner. In
   this problem, mill demands and harvested volumes of a heterogeneous set
   of log types are given over a multi-period planning horizon. Wood can be
   stored at the forest roadside before delivery at a financial cost.
   Rather than solve this as a network linear programme on the basis of
   out-and-back deliveries, we choose to model this problem as a
   generalization of a log-truck scheduling problem. By routing and
   scheduling the trucks in the resolution, this allows us to both
   anticipate potential backhaul opportunities for cost and fuel savings,
   and also minimize queuing times at log-loaders, management of which is a
   major concern in the industry. We model this problem as a mixed integer
   linear programme and solve it via column generation. The methodology is
   tested on several case studies.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a method to measure the body temperature of an
   animal using a thermographic camera in hyperthermia experiments, where
   the heat contrast between the animal and its background is low. This
   work was done in the context of the study of artificially induced
   atypical febrile seizures. In order to measure the temperature of a
   moving animal continuously, we need to detect it in each video frame and
   then select a subset of pixels to evaluate its body temperature. To
   detect the animal in each frame, we propose a tracking method based on
   the minimization of a cost function that uses constraints such as
   temperature smoothness and proximity. The temperature of the animal is
   then taken as the mean of a subset of pixels from the detected area. For
   videos up to 19,000 frames long, the method achieves temperature
   estimation within from ground-truth more than 73 \% of the time in
   difficult measurement scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we demonstrate flexible fiber-based Al-NaOCl galvanic
   cells fabricated using fiber drawing process. Aluminum and copper wires
   are used as electrodes, and they are introduced into the fiber structure
   during drawing of the low-density polyethylene microstructured jacket.
   NaOCl solution is used as electrolyte, and it is introduced into the
   battery after the drawing process. The capacity of a 1 m long fiber
   battery is measured to be similar to 10 mAh. We also detail assembly and
   optimization of the electrical circuitry in the energy-storing fiber
   battery textiles. Several examples of their applications are presented
   including lighting up an LED, driving a wireless mouse and actuating a
   screen with an integrated shape-memory nitinol wire. The principal
   advantages of the presented fiber batteries include: ease of
   fabrication, high flexibility, simple electrochemistry and use of widely
   available materials in the battery design.}},

Abstract = {{Radioactive particle tracking is a nonintrusive technique that has been
   successfully used to study the flow dynamics in a wide range of reactors
   and blenders. However, it is still limited to the tracking of only one
   tracer at a time. A multiple radioactive particle tracking (MRPT)
   technique that can determine the trajectory of two free or restricted
   (attached to the same particle) moving tracers in a system is
   introduced. The accuracy (<5 mm) and precision (<5 mm) of the proposed
   technique is evaluated by tracking two stationary tracers and two moving
   tracers. The results confirm the reliability and validity of the MRPT
   technique when the two tracers have the same isotope and the distance
   between them is not too small (>2 cm). The tracking of two sticking
   tracers at the two ends of a cylindrical particle in a rotating drum is
   also considered to illustrate the potential of this characterization
   method. (c) 2014 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 61:

Title = {{Extracellular matrix mineralization in murine MC3T3-E1 osteoblast
   cultures: An ultrastructural, compositional and comparative analysis
   with mouse bone}},
Journal = {{BONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{244-256}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Bone cell culture systems are essential tools for the study of the
   molecular mechanisms regulating extracellular matrix mineralization.
   MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cell cultures are the most commonly used in vitro
   model of bone matrix mineralization. Despite the widespread use of this
   cell line to study biomineralization, there is as yet no systematic
   characterization of the mineral phase produced in these cultures. Here
   we provide a comprehensive, multi-technique biophysical characterization
   of this cell culture mineral and extracellular matrix, and compare it to
   mouse bone and synthetic apatite mineral standards, to determine the
   suitability of MOT3-E1 cultures for biomineralization studies. Elemental
   compositional analysis by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS)
   showed calcium and phosphorus, and trace amounts of sodium and
   magnesium, in both biological samples. X-ray diffraction (XRD) on
   resin-embedded intact cultures demonstrated that similar to 1-month-old
   mouse bone, apatite crystals grew with preferential orientations along
   the (100), (101) and (111) mineral planes indicative of guided biogenic
   growth as opposed to dystrophic calcification. XRD of crystals isolated
   from the cultures revealed that the mineral phase was poorly crystalline
   hydroxyapatite with 10 to 20 nm-sized nanocrystallites. Consistent with
   the XRD observations, electron diffraction patterns indicated that
   culture mineral had low crystallinity typical of biological apatites.
   Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FUR) confirmed apatitic
   carbonate and phosphate within the biological samples. With all
   techniques utilized, cell culture mineral and mouse bone mineral were
   remarkably similar. Scanning (SEM) and transmission (TEM) electron
   microscopy showed that the cultures had a dense fibrillar collagen
   matrix with small, 100 nm-sized, collagen fibril-associated
   mineralization foci which coalesced to form larger mineral aggregates,
   and where mineralized sites showed the accumulation of the
   mineral-binding protein osteopontin. Light microscopy, confocal
   microscopy and three-dimensional reconstructions showed that some cells
   had dendritic processes and became embedded within the mineral in an
   osteocyte-like manner. In conclusion, we have documented characteristics
   of the mineral and matrix phases of MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cultures, and
   have determined that the structural and compositional properties of the
   mineral are highly similar to that of mouse bone. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{The change of market and the explosion of product variety have led to
   increased automation and the need for complex equipment. Therefore, the
   reliability and the maintainability of the equipment play an important
   role in controlling both the quantity and quality of the products. In
   order to ensure specified availability and reliability of production
   process, preventive maintenance (PM) should be taken during production
   process. However, taking unscheduled PM can impose high costs to the
   firm, and adversely decrease the reliability of production line. In this
   paper, a multi-objective PM scheduling problem in a multiple production
   line is considered. Reliability of production lines, costs of
   maintaining, failure and downtime of system are measured as multiple
   objectives, and different thresholds for available manpower, spare part
   inventory and periods under maintenance is applied. Production system in
   this paper consists of serial and parallel machines. Finally, a test

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Typical challenges of simulation-based design optimization include
   unavailable gradients and unreliable approximations thereof, expensive
   function evaluations, numerical noise, multiple local optima, and the
   failure of the analysis to return a value to the optimizer. One possible
   remedy to alleviate these issues is to use surrogate models in lieu of
   the computational models or simulations and derivative-free optimization
   algorithms. In this work, we use the R dynaTree package to build
   statistical surrogates of the blackboxes and the direct search method
   for derivative-free optimization. We present different formulations for
   the surrogate problem (SP) considered at each search step of the mesh
   adaptive direct search (MADS) algorithm using a surrogate management
   framework. The proposed formulations are tested on 20 analytical
   benchmark problems and two simulation-based multidisciplinary design
   optimization (MDO) problems. Numerical results confirm that the use of
   statistical surrogates in MADS improves the efficiency of the
   optimization algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Opacity is a general language-theoretic framework in which several
   security properties of a system can be expressed. Its parameters are a
   predicate, given as a subset of runs of the system, and an observation
   function, from the set of runs into a set of observables. The predicate
   describes secret information in the system and, in the possibilistic
   setting, it is opaque if its membership cannot be inferred from
   observation.
   In this paper, we propose several notions of quantitative opacity for
   probabilistic systems, where the predicate and the observation function
   are seen as random variables. Our aim is to measure (i) the probability
   of opacity leakage relative to these random variables and (ii) the level
   of uncertainty about membership of the predicate inferred from
   observation. We show how these measures extend possibilistic opacity, we
   give algorithms to compute them for regular secrets and observations,
   and we apply these computations on several classical examples. We
   finally partially investigate the non-deterministic setting.}},

Abstract = {{Environmentally sustainable activities have received an increasing
   interest among the firms to improve their practices in the supply chain.
   Although environmental regulations force firms consider these issues,
   but, green issues are new, evolving every day, and requires a continuous
   study in the field to gain a complete understanding of the problems. In
   this study, we illustrate the case of a laptop manufacturer in Malaysia
   that pursues to evaluate green supply chain management (GSCM) indicators
   among its practitioners. This paper develops a quantitative evaluation
   model to measure the uncertainty of GSCM activities and applies an
   approach based on Vlsekriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje
   (VIKOR) method which is an extension of intuitionistic fuzzy environment
   aiming to solve the green multi-criteria decision making (GMCDM)
   problem. The triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs) were used to handle
   imprecise numerical quantities. Then, a hierarchical multiple criteria
   decision making (MCDM) model was proposed based on fuzzy sets theory and
   VIKOR method to deal with the problem. The results show the alternative
   ranks of the four evaluated companies which was based on their
   performance in GSCM initiatives. The results also indicated that the
   main criteria of the research ranked as follows respectively:
   eco-design, green production, green purchasing, green recycling, green
   transportation and green warehousing. Finally, a comparative analysis of
   results by fuzzy VIKOR is presented. Additionally the scope for future
   studies is provided at the end of the paper. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods for axon diameter
   mapping benefit from higher maximum gradient strengths than are
   currently available on commercial human scanners. Using a dedicated
   high-gradient 3 T human MRI scanner with a maximum gradient strength of
   300 mT/m, we systematically studied the effect of gradient strength on
   in vivo axon diameter and density estimates in the human corpus
   callosum. Pulsed gradient spin echo experiments were performed in a
   single scan session lasting approximately 2 h on each of three human
   subjects. The data were then divided into subsets with maximum gradient
   strengths of 77, 145, 212, and 293 mT/m and diffusion times encompassing
   short (16 and 25 ms) and long (60 and 94 ms) diffusion time regimes. A
   three-compartment model of intra-axonal diffusion, extra-axonal
   diffusion, and free diffusion in cerebrospinal fluid was fitted to the
   data using a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. For the acquisition
   parameters, model, and fitting routine used in our study, it was found
   that higher maximum gradient strengths decreased the mean axon diameter
   estimates by two to three fold and decreased the uncertainty in axon
   diameter estimates by more than half across the corpus callosum. The
   exclusive use of longer diffusion times resulted in axon diameter
   estimates that were up to two times larger than those obtained with
   shorter diffusion times. Axon diameter and density maps appeared less
   noisy and showed improved contrast between different regions of the
   corpus callosum with higher maximum gradient strength. Known differences
   in axon diameter and density between the genu, body, and splenium of the
   corpus callosum were preserved and became more reproducible at higher
   maximum gradient strengths. Our results suggest that an optimal q-space
   sampling scheme for estimating in vivo axon diameters should incorporate
   the highest possible gradient strength. The improvement in axon diameter
   and density estimates that we demonstrate from increasing maximum
   gradient strength will inform protocol development and encourage the
   adoption of higher maximum gradient strengths for use in commercial
   human scanners. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the past years, lots of research works were dedicated to nanowires
   and their integration into functional devices. However, despite the
   great potential of such materials, no device based on nanowires has been
   transferred in all-day-life. In fact, the vertical device integration is
   slowed down by the difficulty to contact easily the top electrode. With
   this work, we present a simple, elegant and versatile process for
   creating a top electrode contact on nanowires: a carbon nanotube sheet
   is suspended at the top of the nanowire field. The proof of concept is
   made through the realization of photovoltaic devices composed of an
   assembly of vertical PN-junctions based on silicon nanowires. For an
   illumination density of 100 mW . cm(-2), our devices exhibit short
   circuit current density as high as 15 mA . cm(-2). Due to the numerous
   advantages of the carbon nanotube sheets as top electrode, such as
   transparency, porosity, good mechanical performance and no need to embed
   nanowires, such simple and elegant technology should definitely find
   developments in every field of nanotechnology.}},

Abstract = {{The electrical properties of eumelanin, a ubiquitous natural pigment,
   have fascinated scientists since the late 1960s. For several decades,
   the hydration-dependent electrical properties of eumelanin have mainly
   been interpreted within the amorphous semiconductor model. Recent works
   undermined this paradigm. Here we study protonic and electronic charge
   carrier transport in hydrated eumelanin in thin film form. Thin films
   are ideal candidates for these studies since they are readily accessible
   to chemical and morphological characterization and potentially amenable
   to device applications. Currentvoltage (I-V) measurements, transient
   current measurements with proton-transparent electrodes, and
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements are reported
   and correlated with the results of the chemical characterization of the
   films, performed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. We show that the
   electrical response of hydrated eumelanin films is dominated by ionic
   conduction (10(-4)10(-3) S cm(-1)), largely attributable to protons, and
   electrochemical processes. To propose an explanation for the electrical
   response of hydrated eumelanin films as observed by EIS and I-V, we
   considered the interplay of proton migration, redox processes, and
   electronic transport. These new insights improve the current
   understanding of the charge carrier transport properties of eumelanin
   opening the possibility to assess the potential of eumelanin for organic
   bioelectronic applications, e.g. protonic devices and implantable
   electrodes, and to advance the knowledge on the functions of eumelanin
   in biological systems.}},

Abstract = {{Apply of microwave heating in a chemical reaction makes the
   investigation of reaction kinetics rather complex, for the challenges of
   measuring reaction temperature and reactants' weight during the exposure
   time. To involve solving these matters, an original bench-scale
   experimental setup was built. This setup is called microwave
   thermo-gravimetric-analyzer (MW-TGA), because it works as a traditional
   thermo-gravimetric-analyzer using microwave heating instead of
   conventional heating. In addition, MW-TGA is equipped with an innovated
   thermometer (air-thermometer) that does not suffer from the traditional
   thermometer drawbacks, particularly when microwave heating is
   implemented. The efficiency of the air-thermometer was validated using a
   traditional thermocouple thermometer, an average percentage relative
   error of 5\% of the reference value was found. Eventually, MW-TGA was
   employed to examine the kinetics of microwave pyrolysis of sawdust. The
   estimated kinetic parameters were 54.5 +/- 1.5 kJ/mol, 3 +/- 0.9 x 10(5)
   min(-1), and 2 for the reaction activation energy, pre-exponential
   factor, and reaction order, respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In industrial processes, heat is transferred from the heating utilities
   to the environment or converted to another form of energy. Process
   operations and heat exchanges decrease the level of energy quality;
   i.e., heat is cascaded to lower temperatures. The energy transfer
   diagram (ETD), which has been recently developed, indicates the flow
   rate of heat transferred from the utilities to the environment through
   each process operation and each heat exchanger as a function of
   temperature. This tool can be used to identify heat savings projects by
   modification of the process units and the heat-exchanger network (HEN).
   However, in a larger sense the diagram indicates the flow rate of energy
   transferred through any system as a function of the level of energy
   quality, and can be used for the analysis of a complete plant, including
   the thermal, chemical, mechanical and electrical transformations. This
   paper presents new developments to consider energy conversion with the
   ETD, the application to an entire kraft pulp mill, including the HEN,
   the process operations, and the utility system, and results from

Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Epidemiological studies are divided over the causative role of body
   weight (BW) in low back pain. Biomechanical modeling is a valuable
   approach to examine the effect of changes in BW on spinal loads and risk
   of back pain. Changes in BW have not been properly simulated by previous
   models as associated alterations in model inputs on the musculature and
   moment arm of gravity loads have been neglected. A detailed,
   multi-joint, scalable model of the thoracolumbar spine is used to study
   the effect of BW (varying at five levels, i.e., 51, 68, 85, 102, and 119
   kg) on the L5-S1 spinal loads during various static symmetric activities
   while scaling moment arms and physiological cross-sectional areas of
   muscles using in vivo imaging data. The L5-S1 loads substantially
   increased with BW especially in flexed postures. As BW increased from 51
   to 119 kg, the L5-S1 compression increased in flexed postures by similar
   to 80-147\% with no load in hands and by similar to 46-52\% in load
   holding tasks. In obese individuals with body mass index > 30 kg/m(2)
   spinal loads further increased by up to 15\% as lever arms for gravity
   loading at the waistline (T12 through L5) increased by 2 cm (for BW=102
   kg) and 4 cm (for BW=119 kg). With changes in BW, spinal loads would
   have moderately altered ( < 17\%) had identical muscle parameters been
   considered. Since scaling muscle parameters demands additional efforts
   in modeling, one could opt for simulation of alterations only in BW
   while using some averaged musculature values. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Current data suggest that chitosan activates wound macrophages to
   release endogenous factors that guide mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) to
   bone fractures. We tested the hypothesis that chitosan, a polymer
   containing glucosamine and N-acetyl glucosamine, stimulates macrophages
   in different polarization states to release functional MSC chemokines
   and mainly anabolic factors. Low-serum conditioned medium was collected
   from M0, M1 and M2a U937 macrophages previously differentiated with
   phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and exposed or not for 24 h to chitosan
   microparticles (80\% degree of deacetylation, DDA, 130 kDa). Chitosan
   particles were highly phagocytosed. Chitosan enhanced anabolic factor
   release from MO and M2a macrophages (MCP-1, IP-10, MIP-1beta, IL-1ra,
   IL-10, PDGF), and IL-lbeta release, with 25- to 400-fold excess IL-1ra
   over IL-1beta. In M1 macrophages, chitosan enhanced IL-1 beta without
   enhancing or suppressing inflammatory factor release (IL-6, IP-10,
   IL-8). MO and M2a macrophages, with or without chitosan stimulation,
   produced conditioned medium that promoted 2-fold more MSC chemotaxis
   than low-serum control medium, while M1-conditioned medium failed to
   induce MSC chemotaxis. Acetylated chitosan induced U937 macrophages to
   release IL-1ra without STAT-6 activation, and also induced a delayed
   STAT-1 activation/IP-10 release response that was not observed using
   non-biodegradable chitosan (98\% DDA, 130 kDa). In primary human
   macrophages, acetylated chitosan enhanced IL-1ra release without
   inducing IL-1beta, and required PMA priming to elicit STAT-1 activation
   and IP-10 release. We conclude that biodegradable chitosan particles
   enhance MO and M2a macrophage anabolic responses independent of the
   IL4/STAT-6 axis, by inducing excess IL-1ra over IL-1beta and more
   chemokine release, without altering their inherent capacity to attract
   MSCs. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a proof of concept screening for monoclonal
   immunoglobulin as a leukemia tumor marker using a surface plasmon
   resonance (SPR) bio-sensing platform. This screening method is based on
   measurements of immunoglobulin levels in human serum and the
   determination of the relative concentrations of kappa and lambda light
   chains. The kappa/lambda ratio is used to determine the presence of
   monoclonal immunoglobulin. Tests have been performed using standard
   solutions of immunoglobulins and serum samples from patients with known
   leukemic diagnoses. This platform has a resolution of 5 x 10(-7)
   refractive index unit (RIU) per channel, which is up to 10 times better
   than other SPR imaging systems for multi-sensing applications. The
   results obtained with this technique are in agreement with those
   acquired using conventional methods for immunoglobulin detection,
   indicating that our polarimetric SPR platform should be suitable for a
   cheap and efficient tool for early leukemia biomarker screening and
   monitoring applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{184}},
Pages = {{111-118}},
Month = {{JAN 14}},
Abstract = {{The PVC screens of recent monitoring wells (MWs) have thin slots and a
   low open area, usually in the 2-8\% range. The MW screen and filter pack
   may cause important head losses which are not taken into account when
   interpreting the data of permeability tests performed using the MW. The
   equivalent hydraulic conductivity K of usual PVC screens was defined by
   hydraulic tests in a water tank, which have shown that gas microbubbles,
   a common problem in MWs and filter packs, contribute to increase the
   parasitic head losses. Closed-form equations and numerical models are
   used to explain by how much a field permeability test in a MW under
   evaluates an aquifer K value due to parasitic head losses in the screen
   and filter pack. The MW can properly measure the local soil K value only
   if it is markedly lower than the maximum MW value as obtained in a water
   tank. The MW measuring capacity can reach 5 x 10(-3) m/s for large slots
   and deaired water, but is most often between 10(-5) and 10(-4) m/s for
   small slots in field conditions, and it can be only 10(-6) m/s for
   poorly designed and installed MWs. The limited measuring capacity may
   yield artificial permeability scale effects as often registered in
   environmental studies. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the central nervous system (CNS) response strategy to
   trunk perturbations could help in prevention of back injuries and
   development of rehabilitation and treatment programs. This study aimed
   to investigate biomechanical response of the trunk musculoskeletal
   system under sudden forward loads, accounting for pre-perturbation
   conditions (preloading, initial posture and abdominal antagonistic
   coactivation) and perturbation magnitudes. Using a trunk
   kinematics-driven iterative finite element (FE) model, temporal profiles
   of measured kinematics and external load along with subjects' weights
   were prescribed to predict thoracolumbar muscle forces/latencies and
   spinal loads for twelve healthy subjects when tested in six conditions
   during pre- and post-perturbation periods. Results demonstrated that
   preloading the trunk significantly (i.e., p < 0.05) increased
   pre-perturbation back muscle forces but significantly decreased
   post-perturbation peak muscle active forces and muscle latencies.
   Initial trunk flexion significantly increased muscle active and passive
   forces before the perturbation and their peak values after the
   perturbation, which in turn caused much larger spinal loads. Abdominal
   muscles antagonistic pre-activation did not alter the internal variables
   investigated in this study. Increase in sudden applied load increased
   muscle reflex activities and spinal forces; a 50 N increase in sudden
   load (i.e., when comparing 50 N to 100 N) increased the L5-S1
   compression force by 1327 N under 5 N preload and by 1374 N under 50 N
   preload. Overall, forces on the spine and hence risk of failure
   substantially increased in sudden forward loading when the magnitude of
   sudden load increased and when the trunk was initially in a flexed
   posture. In contrast, a higher initial preload diminished reflex
   latencies and compression forces. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   lens blur. We first introduce an accurate camera-scene alignment
   framework that avoids erroneous homography estimation and camera tone
   curve estimation. This alignment is used to generate a sharp
   correspondence of a target pattern captured by the camera. Second, we
   introduce a Point Spread Function (PSF) estimation approach where
   information about the frequency spectrum of the target image is taken
   into account. As a result of these steps and the ability to use multiple
   target images in this framework, we achieve a PSF estimation method
   robust against noise and suitable for mobile devices. Experimental
   results show that the proposed method results in PSFs with more than 10
   dB higher accuracy in noisy conditions compared with the PSFs generated
   using state-of-the-art techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-antenna OFDMA-SDMA systems provide the required high spectral
   efficiency and flexibility to support the ever increasing data rates
   requirements of real-time multimedia applications in future wireless
   access systems. However, the resource allocation process becomes
   extremely complex because of the large number of degrees of freedom and
   the strict timing requirement of real-time traffic. In this paper, we
   propose heuristics to efficiently solve the zero-forcing OFDMA-SDMA
   resource allocation problem and provide, when feasible, guaranteed
   service to users with minimum rate requirements. The heuristics combine
   both rate-constrained power allocation and subcarrier reassignment
   algorithms. We compare the heuristics performance against an upper bound
   and other methods proposed in the literature and find that, although
   they have a slightly lower sum rate performance, they support a wider
   range of minimum rates while significantly reducing the computational
   complexity, making them suitable for usage in real-time systems.}},

Abstract = {{Small and medium-size enterprise accidents constitute a large proportion
   of the occupational health and safety accidents recorded in the
   construction industry. The methods used to tackle occupational health
   and safety issues in large enterprises do not work most of the time in

   occupational health and safety in these enterprises has to incorporate
   methods and tools specifically designed for them. This can be done by
   using a risk estimation tool specifically designed for small and medium
   sized enterprises. In this paper a literature survey supplemented by
   data collection is used to identify key factors which can be used in the
   occupational health and safety risk estimation tool. Three sources were
   used to identify factors by analyzing and comparing the data acquired.
   Consequently, 9 key factors were chosen in total from the three data

Abstract = {{The process of treating an aircraft at the end-of-life (EoL) has caused
   an increasing concern due to the growing number of the manufactured and
   retired aircrafts each year. While an aircraft EoL, maintains a
   considerable amount of value, it suffers from various environmental and
   economic issues. In this research, the disassembly process of a real
   aircraft EoL, (Bombardier CRJ-200) has been looked at from a conceptual
   point of vim with an initiative aim to increase the associated
   added-value while reducing the environmental footprints. It is screened

Abstract = {{In real life, decision-making problems arc not fixed, and by the time
   some modifications to the initial problem may be required. TOPSIS
   technique has been commonly used to solve decision-making problems. This
   technique is based on the comparison between all the alternatives
   included in the problem. Thus, if one alternative is removed or added,
   depending on the situation, the whole process for TOPSIS should be
   redone, which is laborious and time-consuming. The integration of design
   of experiment (DOE) and TOPSIS allows easily determine the score for
   each alternative independently, without any comparison. This gives more
   degree of freedom to the users, even though the accuracy is compromised.
   In this work both techniques were applied to a simple case-study.
   Results showed that using a polynomial regression model with 84.53\%
   reliability, the rankings from DOE-TOPSIS and normal TOPSIS are the
   same. This proposed technique can be highly useful in large scale
   decision-making problems as often found in aeronautic and automotive

Abstract = {{In the field of automatic signature verification, a major challenge for
   statistical analysis and pattern recognition is the small number of
   reference signatures per user. Score normalization, in particular, is
   challenged by the lack of information about intra-user variability. In
   this paper, we analyze several approaches to score normalization for
   dynamic time warping and propose a new two-stage normalization which
   detects simple forgeries in a first stage and copes with more skilled
   forgeries in a second stage. An experimental evaluation is conducted on
   two data sets with different characteristics, namely the MCYT on-line
   signature corpus, which contains over three hundred users, and the SUSIG
   visual sub-corpus, which contains highly skilled forgeries. The results
   demonstrate that score normalization is a key component for signature
   verification and that the proposed two-stage normalization achieves some
   of the best results on these difficult data sets both for random and for
   skilled forgeries.}},

Abstract = {{Word level handwritten CAPTCHA generation involves picking a handwritten
   word from a pre-existing database and cumulatively applying distortions
   and noise models. In principle, the addition of distortion and noise
   makes the CAPTCHA robust to automated attacks. However, the primary
   drawback of the word level CAPTCHA generation is that it limits us to
   words that already exist in our data set. If the primary building block
   of this approach was a character, we could move away from a lexicon
   based CAPTCHA generation and generate CAPTCHAs which are resistant to a
   dictionary based attack. In this paper, we propose a Sigma-Lognormal
   based approach to generate character level CAPTCHAs. Next, we increase
   the robustness of the model by applying ideas from accents in
   handwriting to our problem. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our
   approach by simulating an attack by an automated word recognizer.}},

Abstract = {{This work shows that simultaneous measurements of temperature and
   pressure signals for a bubbling gas-solid fluidized bed can be
   considered as a simple and effective early detection technique of
   defluidization conditions. The modification of the hydrodynamics of the
   bed due to the presence of interparticle forces (IPFs) was primarily
   investigated using different measurement techniques (i.e., pressure
   transducers, optical fiber probe, and Radioactive Particle Tracking).
   Different levels of IPFs were attained in the bed with the help of a
   polymer coating approach at near-ambient temperature (30-40 degrees C)
   in a 15 cm ID fluidized bed. Experimental results showed that by
   increasing the degree of IPFs in the bed, larger bubbles were noted at
   gas velocities well above the minimum fluidization velocity, the
   emulsion phase voidage increased, and the mean value of the in-bed
   differential bed pressure drop and the axial solids mixing decreased.
   The high temperature defluidization tests (800-1000 degrees C) as the
   second part the experimental campaign were conducted in a 20 cm ID
   fluidized bed reactor. It was found that the temperature difference
   between the bottommost thermocouple ( located 5 cm above the
   distributor) and the others located in the dense bed was continuously
   increasing when the bed was approaching defluidization. Simultaneously,
   the mean value of the differential pressure signals was successively
   decreasing from its regular value under normal conditions. A combination
   of these two conditions was considered as the monitoring method for the
   early detection of defluidization. It was found that this approach was
   effectively capable of predicting the onset of defluidization minutes to
   hours before complete defluidization, allowing time to apply
   counteracting strategies. Experimental results of the first part of the
   work clearly demonstrated why the simple integrated approach discovered
   in the second part of the study can be efficiently used for timely
   recognition of defluidization conditions. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{The many cores design research community have shown high interest in
   optical crossbars on chip for more than a decade. Key properties of
   optical crossbars, namely a) contention-free data routing b) low-latency
   communication and c) potential for high bandwidth through the use of
   WDM, motivate several implementations. These implementations demonstrate
   very different scalability and power efficiency ability depending on
   three key design factors: a) the network topology, b) the considered
   layout and c) the insertion losses induced by the fabrication process.
   The emerging design technique relying on multi-layer deposited silicon
   allows reducing optical losses, which may lead to significant reduction
   of the power consumption. In this paper, multi-layer deposited silicon
   based crossbars are proposed and compared. The results indicate that the
   proposed ring-based network exhibits, on average, 22\% and 51.4\%
   improvement for worst-case and average losses respectively compared to
   the most power-efficient related crossbars.}},

   very few predicates can be used for inference purposes; and d) very few

Abstract = {{Antipatterns in Service-based Systems (SBSs)-service
   antipatterns-represent ``bad{''} solutions to recurring design problems.
   In opposition to design patterns, which are good solutions, antipatterns
   should be avoided by the engineers. Antipatterns may also be introduced
   due to diverse changes performed against new user requirements and
   execution contexts. Service antipatterns may degrade the quality of
   design and may hinder the future maintenance and evolution of SBSs. The
   detection of service antipatterns is important to improve the design
   quality of SBSs and to ease their maintenance. A better understanding of
   service antipatterns is a must prerequisite to perform their detection.
   This paper presents a taxonomy of service antipatterns in Web services
   and SCA (Service Component Architecture), the two common SBSs
   implementation technologies. The presented taxonomy will facilitate
   engineers their understanding on service antipatterns. Other substantial
   benefits of the presented taxonomy include: (1) assisting in the
   specification and detection of service antipatterns, (2) revealing the
   relationships among various groups of service antipatterns, (3) grouping
   together antipatterns that are fundamentally related, and (4) providing
   an overview of various system-level design problems ensemble.}},

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates an iterative reconstruction technique, the OSC-TV
   regularized maximum-likelihood algorithm, in the field of optical
   cone-beam computed tomography (CT). This imaging modality is commonly
   used in gel-based three-dimensional (3D) dosimetry for external beam
   radiotherapy. It is conjectured that model-based iterative
   reconstruction may improve optical CT image quality and encourage a
   wider use of this modality in clinical dosimetry. The OSC-TV algorithm
   was evaluated using experimental data from a commercially available
   optical cone-beam CT system, and the resulting images were compared with
   those obtained via filtered backprojection. Physical phantoms were
   scanned with the goal of evaluating the modulation transfer function,
   reconstruction precision and accuracy. Reconstruction artifacts were
   studied as well. The OSC-TV algorithm yielded images of improved quality
   compared to the filtered back-projections, thanks to a model-based
   simulation of the photon attenuation process. It was shown to improve
   spatial resolution, reduce noise and improve accuracy and precision of
   linear attenuation coefficients' estimation. In addition, image
   artifacts due to acquisition process and total signal loss were
   corrected. Overall, this study demonstrates that OSC-TV represents a
   valuable alternative to filtered backprojection for optical cone-beam
   CT.}},

   instantaneous recovery times and aims at zero packet-loss after failure
   detection, regardless of controller reachability, even when OpenFlow's

   based on OpenState, an OpenFlow extension that allows a programmer to

Abstract = {{In this paper, a low-power CMOS voltage-mode quaternary latched

   comparison mode, it compares the input analog signal with three

   accordingly, and in latch mode, it saves the output voltage which was
   generated in the previous mode. In addition to its operation as a
   quaternary latch in multiple-valued logic (MVL) circuits, the proposed
   comparator can also be used as a 4-level quantizer in such applications
   as quaternary data converters. The proposed circuit operates based on
   three parallel binary comparisons with different comparison
   characteristics. Designed in a 0.18-mu m standard CMOS technology, the
   circuit exhibits simulation results which show power consumption of 20
   mu W from 1.8-V power supply while operating at 500 kHz. Also, in order

Abstract = {{A general structure for capacitive digital to analog converters (CDACs)
   is presented in which non binary, base-m capacitor sizing is introduced.
   Base-m sizing opens new trade-offs in area and INL/DNL efficiency. A
   base-4 (i.e., quaternary-weighted) DAC (QWDAC) is designed as an example
   of the proposed structure. This converter is designed and simulated
   after being laid out in a 0.18-mu m CMOS technology at 1.8V power
   supply. In a typical 6-bit DAC using base-4 technique, the area reduces
   by a factor of three as compared to the conventional binary weighted
   DAC. Several Monte-Carlo simulations suggest that capacitor mismatch
   effect of the base-m structure is reduced owing to the smaller number of
   separate capacitors involved in the generation of a desired code.
   Moreover, the general base-m structure can be generalized to two-stage
   CDAC and C-2C architectures to improve the area efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{As the world of computing goes more and more parallel, reconfigurable
   computing can enable interesting compromises in terms of processing
   speed and power consumption between CPUs and GPUs. Yet, from a
   developer's perspective, programming Field-Programmable Gate Arrays to
   implement application specific processors still represents a significant
   challenge. In this paper, we present the application of an
   Intermediate-Level Synthesis methodology to the design of a Gauss-Jordan
   elimination linear solver on FPGA. The ILS methodology takes for input a
   language offering an Algorithmic-State Machine programming model. Each
   ASM handles blocking and non-blocking connections between
   data-synchronized channels having streaming interfaces with implicit
   ready-to-send/receive signals. Using our compiler, a scalable linear
   solver design reaching as much as 46.2 GFLOPS was designed and tested in
   a matter of days, showing how the ILS methodology can enable an
   interesting design time/performance compromise between RTL and HLS
   methodologies.}},

Abstract = {{Deep learning based approaches to facial analysis and video analysis
   have recently demonstrated high performance on a variety of key tasks
   such as face recognition, emotion recognition and activity recognition.
   In the case of video, information often must be aggregated across a
   variable length sequence of frames to produce a classification result.
   Prior work using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for emotion
   recognition in video has relied on temporal averaging and pooling
   operations reminiscent of widely used approaches for the spatial
   aggregation of information. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have seen
   an explosion of recent interest as they yield state-of-the-art
   performance on a variety of sequence analysis tasks. RNNs provide an
   attractive framework for propagating information over a sequence using a
   continuous valued hidden layer representation. In this work we present a
   complete system for the 2015 Emotion Recognition in the Wild (EmotiW)
   Challenge. We focus our presentation and experimental analysis on a
   hybrid CNN-RNN architecture for facial expression analysis that can
   outperform a previously applied CNN approach using temporal averaging

Abstract = {{In this paper, a comprehensive experimental investigation is done on the
   performance of abrasive waterjet polishing process to polish the
   surfaces of large hydraulic turbines. For this, a sequential design of
   experiment is used to study the effect of polishing parameter on the
   surface roughness. Based on the results of these tests, local optimal
   value of each parameter is identified and used to update its value to
   test the next parameter. Through these experiments, the effect of six
   main polishing parameters including pressure, nozzle angle, traversing
   speed, abrasive feeding rate, stand-off distance, and abrasive type/size
   on the surface roughness is investigated. Next, the correlation between
   these parameters is evaluated and accordingly two parameters are
   combined to produce a more generalize parameter which can better
   describe the performance of this polishing technique. The results of
   this paper will be ultimately used to optimize this process.}},

   experiments show that the cache fulfills all the requirements for PTA,
   and program timing can be determined with arbitrary accuracy. In
   addition, random placement and replacement improve the observed worst

Abstract = {{Modern integrated circuits generate very high heat fluxes that can lead
   to a high temperature, degrading the performance and reducing the life
   time of the device. Thermal simulation is used to prevent this kind of
   issues, and many models were introduced in recent years. However, their
   validation is challenging: it is either based on established simulators
   (with reduced accuracy), or requires to produce a specific test chip
   with several thermal sensors. In this paper we propose a methodology and
   measurement setup that uses existing commercial processors to validate
   thermal models. We use infrared thermography and low-cost thermoelectric
   cooling, avoiding the issues of mineral oil setups used in previous
   works. We show how our approach was used to validate two thermal
   simulators.}},

Abstract = {{Recent progress in using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for image
   description has motivated the exploration of their application for video
   description. However, while images are static, working with videos
   requires modeling their dynamic temporal structure and then properly
   integrating that information into a natural language description. In
   this context, we propose an approach that successfully takes into
   account both the local and global temporal structure of videos to
   produce descriptions. First, our approach incorporates a spatial
   temporal 3-D convolutional neural network (3-D CNN) representation of
   the short temporal dynamics. The 3-D CNN representation is trained on
   video action recognition tasks, so as to produce a representation that
   is tuned to human motion and behavior. Second we propose a temporal
   attention mechanism that allows to go beyond local temporal modeling and
   learns to automatically select the most relevant temporal segments given
   the text-generating RNN. Our approach exceeds the current state-of-art
   for both BLEU and METEOR metrics on the Youtube2Text dataset. We also
   present results on a new, larger and more challenging dataset of paired
   video and natural language descriptions.}},

   scheme, based on the Kinematic Theory of rapid human movements and its

   potential for skilled forgery detection of the Kinematic Theory of rapid
   human movements. Experiments were carried out on the publicly available
   BiosecurID multimodal database, comprising 400 subjects. Results show
   that the performance of the DTW-based system improves for both skilled

Abstract = {{Force is considered to be one of the indicators that best describe the
   machining process. Measured force can be used to evaluate the quality
   and geometric profile of the machined part. In this paper, a
   combinatorial optimization approach is used to characterize the effect
   of force on the quality of a machined part made of Carbon Fiber
   Reinforced Polymers (CFRP) material. The approach is called Logical
   Analysis of Data (LAD) and is based on machine learning and pattern
   recognition. LAD is used in order to map the machining conditions, in
   terms of force and torque that lead to conforming products and those
   which lead to nonconforming products. In this paper, the LAD technique
   is applied to the drilling of CFRP plates, and the results, based on
   data obtained experimentally, are reported. A discussion of the
   potential use of LAD in manufacturing concludes the paper.}},

Abstract = {{The number and variety of computer threats has fueled a digital arms
   race, resulting in a complex software ecosystem around malware and
   antivirus (anti-malware) products. While there has been significant past
   work in benchmarking antivirus (AV) products against each other, how
   healthy is the overall AV software ecosystem?
   Using data collected from Microsoft Windows Malicious Software Removal
   Tool (MSRT) running on more than one billion machines, we develop
   ecosystem health measures based upon infection rates, product diversity,
   market dominance, and activity status. Our study shows that while a
   diverse group of products is used and the vast majority of them are
   running properly, there is also significant churn in product usage which
   may indicate dissatisfaction with current products. While further work
   is needed to better understand these patterns, this study shows the
   potential power of an ecosystem health-based approach to studying AV
   performance in practice.}},

   we propose the use of a block version of the BiCGStab algorithm that can
   take advantage of the fact that all forward problems share the same
   linear operator, thereby significantly reducing the amount of
   computation. In order to make the technique faster and more robust, an
   implementation based on a partition of the illuminations into subsets is
   introduced. Simulations are carried out on a realistic setup for image
   reconstruction and reveal the superiority of the proposed algorithm over
   the BiCGStab method, mainly for high contrasted objects.}},

Abstract = {{A backward and forward coupled ring transmission line all-pass phasers
   are presented, and their general characteristics, operation principles
   and typical group characteristics are discussed using ideal circuit
   simulations. The first configuration is based on contra-directional (
   backward) coupling, which is perfectly TEM, while the second
   configuration is based on non-TEM co-directional ( forward) coupling,
   which is the radiofrequency counterpart of the optical ring resonator
   coupling. Compared to conventional end-connected coupled-line phasers,
   the group delay swings of the proposed phasers are inversely
   proportional to the involved coupling coefficients. They thus represent
   practically promising devices for high-resolution realtime radio.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative assessment of first-pass cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
   perfusion imaging is useful for detecting coronary artery disease, but
   it requires the measurement of the arterial input function (AIF) from
   the left ventricle. This is usually done manually, which is time
   consuming and subjective. This study presents an automated method for
   measuring the AIF from the first-pass CMR perfusion images. It was
   tested on 194 clinical perfusion studies and compared with manual
   reference measurements. Our results show the proposed method
   successfully measured 98.79\% of the perfusion series, with manual and
   automated measurements strongly correlating. Temporal statistics were
   similar for both measurements, showing agreement between the automated
   and manual AIFs. The automated method, however, more accurately selected
   the brightest left ventricle pixels and excluded papillary muscles.
   These improvements may help make AIF measurement and quantitative CMR
   myocardial perfusion analysis more accurate and readily available.}},

Abstract = {{First-pass dynamic contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging
   is an increasingly important diagnostic tool for coronary artery
   disease. It is typically performed with breath holding and
   electrocardiogram gating to minimize motion, but movement caused by
   residual respiration, cardiac arrhythmia, or missed gating triggers
   during image acquisition will induce nonrigid deformations of the
   myocardium that can hamper interpretation and perfusion quantification.
   We propose an automatic nonrigid image registration framework to correct
   motion in a series of cardiac magnetic resonance perfusion images. Our
   method employs reference frame detection combined with robust flow field
   estimation using a large displacement optical flow formulation coupled
   with post -hoc image warping and flow field distortion correction. This
   framework is multi-threadable and can be applied to standard myocardial
   series, arterial input function series, and proton density weighted
   images to facilitate perfusion quantification.}},

Abstract = {{Make is one of the oldest build technologies and is still widely used
   today, whether by manually writing Makefiles, or by generating them
   using tools like Autotools and CMake. Despite its conceptual simplicity,
   modern Make implementations such as GNU Make have become very complex
   languages, featuring functions, macros, lazy variable assignments and
   (in GNU Make 4.0) the Guile embedded scripting language. Since we are
   interested in understanding how widespread such complex language
   features are, this paper studies the use of Make features in almost
   20,000 Makefiles, comprised of over 8.4 million lines, from more than
   350 different open source projects. We look at the popularity of
   features and the difference between hand-written Makefiles and those
   generated using various tools. We find that generated Makefiles use only
   a core set of features and that more advanced features (such as function
   calls) are used very little, and almost exclusively in hand-written
   Makefiles.}},

Abstract = {{Malware detection on mobile phones involves analysing and matching large
   amount of data streams against a set of known malware signatures.
   Unfortunately, as the number of threats grows continuously, the number
   of malware signatures grows proportionally. This is time consuming and
   leads to expensive computation costs, especially for mobile devices
   where memory, power and computation capabilities are limited. As the
   security threat level is getting worse, parallel computation
   capabilities for mobile phones is getting better with the evolution of
   mobile graphical processing units (GPUs). In this paper, we discuss how
   we can benefit from the evolving parallel processing capabilities of
   mobile devices in order to accelerate malware detection on Android
   mobile phones. We have designed and implemented a parallel host based
   anti-malware for mobile devices that exploits the computation
   capabilities of mobile GPUs. A series of computation and memory
   optimization techniques are proposed to increase the detection
   throughput. The results suggest that mobile graphic cards can be used
   effectively to accelerate malware detection for mobile phones.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing is an attractive business model offering cost-efficiency
   and business agility. Recently, the trend is that small and large
   businesses are moving their services to cloud environments. The quality
   of service is always negotiated between the cloud users and the cloud
   providers and documented in the service level agreement (SLA). Yet
   assuring-or even measuring-the quality of the provided service can be
   challenging. This paper proposes a formal approach for quantifying the
   quality of service in the cloud systems as promised in the SLA. The
   proposed approach uses controller synthesis to find a system
   configuration that meets the SLA requirements. The formal approach
   suggested in this paper is based on, but not limited to, Time Petri Nets
   (TPN). As a case study, we focus on service availability as a key
   performance indicator in the SLA and for a sample set of resources
   providing a service, we determine the system configuration satisfying

   the recent trend to reduce the release cycle to days or even hours
   starts to question some of the common beliefs and practices of the

   weeks, generating updates for dozens of existing Firefox versions on 5
   desktop, 2 mobile and 3 mobile desktop platforms, each of which for more
   than 80 locales. In this context, the International Workshop on Release

Abstract = {{This paper is a report on the 8th International Workshop on Search-Based
   Software Testing at the 37th International Conference on Sofrware
   Engineering (ICSE). Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) is a form of
   Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) that optimizes testing through
   the use of computational search. SBST is used to generate test data,
   prioritize test cases, minimize test suites, reduce human oracle cost,
   verify software models, test service-orientated architectures, construct
   test suites for interaction testing, and validate real-time properties.
   The objectives of this workshop are to bring together researchers and
   industrial practitioners from SBST and the wider software engineering
   community to share experience and provide directions for future
   research, and to encourage the use of search techniques to combine
   aspects of testing with other aspects of the software engineering
   lifecycle.
   Three full research papers, three short papers, and three position
   papers will be presented in the two-day workshop. Additionally, six
   development groups have pitted their test generation tools against a
   common set of programs and benchmarks, and will present their techniques
   and results. This report will give the background of the workshop and
   detail the provisional program.}},

Abstract = {{Execution traces are frequently used to study system run-time behavior
   and to detect problems. However, the huge amount of data in an execution
   trace may complexify its analysis. Moreover, users are not usually
   interested in all events of a trace, hence the need for a proper
   filtering approach. Filtering is used to generate an enhanced trace,
   with a reduced size and complexity, that is easier to analyse. The
   approach described in this paper allows to define custom filtering
   patterns, declaratively in XML, to concentrate the analysis on the most
   important and interesting events. The filtering scenarios include
   syntaxes to describe various analysis patterns using finite state
   machines. The patterns range from very simple event filtering to complex
   multi-level event abstraction, covering various types of synthetic
   behaviours that can be captured from execution trace data. The paper
   provides the details on this data-driven filtering approach and some
   interesting use cases for the trace events generated by the LTTng Linux
   kernel tracer.}},

Abstract = {{The joint operation of radar sensing and wireless communication, namely
   RadCom system, yields a unique platform to meet the requirements of
   future intelligent transportation networks. Taking advantages of OFDM
   waveform, the range-Doppler coupling issues can be overcome for radar
   applications and complex equalization filter is no longer necessarily
   used to cope with frequency-selective fading channel because of
   multipath. This paper presents a technique for simultaneous estimation
   of the range and Doppler shift of targets using an OFDM-based Radcom
   system. Unlike the previous method based on fourier analysis to estimate
   the range and Doppler shift, we derive a subspace-based algorithm by
   applying a smoothing approach for joint estimation of range and Doppler
   shift without the pair matching problem. Compared to the previous
   method, our method is able to at least exhibit the following three
   advantages: 1) higher resolution for multiple targets, 2) less
   time-based data, and 3) avoidance of pair-matching techniques.
   Therefore, this method is more suitable for OFDM-based RadCom systems
   with high mobility and high data rate. Furthermore, the proposed
   algorithm is compared with the current counterpart with computer
   simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Terrestrial applications of microwave power transmission (MPT) such as
   RFID is highly challenging. As the distance between energy transmitter
   and receiving circuit increases, the available received power ramps
   down, thus causing an abrupt drop in RF/DC conversion circuit. Numerous
   works have been reported recently, but resulting in very incremental
   improvements over the state of the art.
   This paper proposes an original concept that is quite different from the
   current mainstream rectifier design. Instead of developing rectifier
   using a nonlinear resistance (diode), it is proposed to design the
   circuit with a nonlinear reactance.
   A theoretical foundation is provided, showing the loss limitation of
   diode-based rectifier circuits as well as the superiority of the
   proposed new concept at low power. Finally, an evaluation of efficiency
   for a practical RF-DC conversion at 2.45GHz is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a wideband substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) cavity
   backed patch antenna element is proposed for high-gain arrays at
   millimeter-wave bands. By compensating the inductance of the feeding
   metallic via with a capacitive ring slot on the ground plate, an
   additional resonance is introduced to the patch mode to expand the
   bandwidth. To suppress the backward radiation from the slot and enhance
   antenna gain, a back SIW cavity is designed. Moreover, the low-loss and
   compact substrate integrated coaxial line (SICL) is employed as the
   feeding line. The simulated -10/-15 dB impedance bandwidth of the
   element is 14.9\%/11.6\% (both at 43 GHz). The introducing of the back
   cavity and SICL makes the element suitable for large wideband high-gain
   millimeter-wave arrays with excellent front-to-back ratios (FBRs) and
   stable radiation patterns on printed circuit boards (PCBs). As an
   illustrative example, a 2x2 corporately-fed sub-array is developed and
   tested. The -10 dB impedance bandwidth is 11.7\%, and the peak gain is
   11.4 dBi with a simulated radiation efficiency of 88\% and measured FBR
   of above 20 dB.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel part-based method for model-free tracking. In our
   model, keypoints are considered as elementary predictors, collaborating
   to localize the target. In order to differentiate reliable features from
   outliers and bad predictors, we define the notion of feature saliency
   including three factors: the persistence, the spatial consistency, and
   the predictive power of local features. Saliency information is learned
   during tracking to be used in several algorithmic steps: local
   predictions, global localization, feature removal, etc. By exploiting
   saliency information and keypoint structural properties, the proposed
   algorithm is able to track accurately generic objects, facing several
   difficulties such as occlusions, presence of distractors, and abrupt
   motion. The proposed tracker demonstrated a high robustness on
   challenging public datasets, outperforming significantly five recent
   state-of-the-art trackers.}},

   type of word-based approach that regulates its own internal parameters
   using feedback mechanisms to withstand difficult conditions while
   keeping sensitivity intact in regular situations. Coined ``PAWCS{''},
   this method's key advantages lie in its highly persistent and robust
   dictionary model based on color and local binary features as well as its
   ability to automatically adjust pixel-level segmentation behavior.
   Experiments using the 2012 ChangeDetection.net dataset show that it
   outranks numerous recently proposed solutions in terms of overall
   performance as well as in each category. A complete C++ implementation

Abstract = {{Some applications, especially real time simulation systems, require to
   compute a linear system's solution in a very short amount of time. FPGA
   are well known to offer low latency computation and current chips are
   dense enough to implement hundreds of floating point operators. However,
   their many-stage pipelined architecture and the high cost of the
   divisors make the implementation of low latency applications a real
   challenge. We propose a division free algorithm founded on Gauss-Jordan
   algorithm, which takes advantage of the floating point format (any
   precision) and which exploits as much as possible the pipelined
   architecture of the operators. Results demonstrate that current FPGA can
   solve linear systems larger than hundred equations within ten
   microseconds in single or double precision arithmetic. This represents a
   two order of magnitude improvement over previous implementations.}},

Abstract = {{Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a key element for wireless applications
   based on the OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) and
   challenging for implementing on processor multicores/many-cores. As an
   example, the Long Term Evolution (LTE) protocol establishes a
   requirement for processing, whereby many independent FFTs must be
   calculated within a limited time slot. By using Intel Math Kernel
   Library (MKL), in our approach to Xeon phi, we managed to reduce the
   maximum execution time of many independent FFTs. We proposed an
   implementation on processors multi-cores/many-cores using OpenMP (Open
   Multi-processing) reducing the mean time latency to 124 mu s on native
   mode after 1300 mu s with the offload. This is a challenge for shared
   memory projects. This paper describes how this level of performance can
   be obtained with multi-core Intel i7, Xeon processors and a many-core
   Xeon Phi. The best results were obtained with the Xeon Phi, which
   outperformed the Xeon Sandy-Bridge.}},

Abstract = {{In most countries, basic research is supported through governmental
   research councils that select, after peer review, the individuals or
   teams what will receive funding. Unfortunately, the number of grants
   these research councils can allocate is not infinite, and many
   researchers (45\% in Quebec) are not able to obtain any funding. A small
   minority of those who do get funded account for the majority of the
   available funds. However, it is unknown whether or not this is an
   optimal way of distributing available funds. The purpose of this study
   is to measure the relation between the amount of funds given to 14,103
   individual Quebec's researchers over a fifteen year period (1998-2012)
   and the total outcome of their research in terms of output and impact
   from 2000 to 2012. Our results show that both in terms of the quantity
   of papers produced and of their scientific impact, the concentration of
   research funding in the hands of a so-called `elite' of researchers
   generally produces diminishing returns.}},

Abstract = {{The successful OpenFlow approach to Software Defined Networking (SDN)
   allows network programmability through a central controller able to
   orchestrate a set of dumb switches. However, the simple match/action
   abstraction of OpenFlow switches constrains the evolution of the
   forwarding rules to be fully managed by the controller. This can be
   particularly limiting for a number of applications that are affected by
   the delay of the slow control path, like traffic management
   applications. Some recent proposals are pushing toward an evolution of
   the OpenFlow abstraction to enable the evolution of forwarding policies
   directly in the data plane based on state machines and local events. In
   this paper, we present two traffic management applications that exploit
   a stateful data plane and their prototype implementation based on
   OpenState, an OpenFlow evolution that we recently proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Human Affectiveness, i.e., the emotional state of a person, plays a
   crucial role in many domains where it can make or break a team's ability
   to produce successful products. Software development is a collaborative
   activity as well, yet there is little information on how affectiveness
   impacts software productivity. As a first measure of this impact, this
   paper analyzes the relation between sentiment, emotions and politeness
   of developers in more than 560K Jira comments with the time to fix a
   Jira issue. We found that the happier developers are (expressing
   emotions such as JOY and LOVE in their comments), the shorter the issue
   fixing time is likely to be. In contrast, negative emotions such as
   SADNESS, are linked with longer issue fixing time. Politeness plays a
   more complex role and we empirically analyze its impact on developers'
   productivity.}},

Abstract = {{This dataset documents the activity in the public portion of the git
   Super-repository of the Linux kernel during 2012. In a distributed
   version control system, such as git, the Super-repository is the
   collection of all the repositories (repos) used for development. In such
   a Super-repository, some repos will be accessible only by their owners
   (they are private, and are located in places that are unreachable to
   other users) while others are available to other members of the team.
   The latter public repositories are used as avenues through which commits
   flow from one developer to another. During the last six weeks of 2011,
   we proceeded to automatically discover the public portion of the
   Super-repository of Linux. Then, in 2012, every 3 hrs, each of these
   public repositories was queried to see what new commits it had and what
   commits had disappeared from it using a process we call continuous
   mining. This resulted in the identification of 533,513 different commits
   across 451 different public repositories and how they propagated through
   the Linux Super-repository, including the repository of Linus Torvalds
   (i.e., the main repository of the Linux kernel). This information could
   help us understand how kernel contributors use git, how they collaborate
   and how commits are integrated into the Linux kernel and into the
   repositories of organizations that distribute the kernel.

Abstract = {{Non-interference (NI) is a property of systems stating that confidential
   actions should not cause effects observable by unauthorized users.
   Several variants of NI have been studied for many types of models, but
   rarely for true concurrency or unbounded models. This work investigates
   NI for High-level Message Sequence Charts (HMSC), a scenario language
   for the description of distributed systems, based on composition of
   partial orders. We first propose a general definition of security
   properties in terms of equivalence among observations, and show that
   these properties, and in particular NI are undecidable for HMSCs. We
   hence consider weaker local properties, describing situations where a
   system is attacked by a single agent, and show that local NI is
   decidable. We then refine local NI to a finer notion of causal NI that
   emphasizes causal dependencies between confidential actions and
   observations, and extend it to causal NI with (selective)
   declassification of confidential events. Checking whether a system
   satisfies local and causal NI and their declassified variants are
   PSPACE-complete problems.}},

Abstract = {{PHP is by far the most popular WEB scripting language, accounting for
   more than 80\% of existing websites. PHP is dynamically typed, which
   means that variables take on the type of the objects that they are
   assigned, and may change type as execution proceeds. While some type
   changes are likely not harmful, others involving function calls and
   global variables may be more difficult to understand and the source of
   many bugs. Hack, a new PHP variant endorsed by Facebook, attempts to
   address this problem by adding static typing to PHP variables, which
   limits them to a single consistent type throughout execution.
   This paper defines an empirical taxonomy of PHP type changes along three
   dimensions: the complexity or burden imposed to understand the type
   change; whether or not the change is potentially harmful; and the actual
   types changed. We apply static and dynamic analyses to three widely used
   WEB applications coded in PHP (WordPress, Drupal and phpBB) to
   investigate (1) to what extent developers really use dynamic typing, (2)
   what kinds of type changes are actually encountered; and (3) how
   difficult it might be to refactor the code to avoid type changes, and
   thus meet the constraints of Hack's static typing.
   We report evidence that dynamic typing is actually a relatively uncommon
   practice in production PHP programs, and that most dynamic type changes
   are simple representational changes, such as between strings and
   integers. We observe that most PHP type changes in these programs are
   relatively simple, and that the largest proportion of them are easy to
   refactor to consistent static typing using simple local renaming
   transformations. Overall, the paper casts doubt on the usefulness of
   dynamic typing in PHP, and indicates that for many production
   applications, conversion to Hack's static typing may not be very
   difficult.}},

Abstract = {{The manual control of manipulator robots can be complex and time
   consuming even for simple tasks, due to a number of degrees of freedom
   (DoF) of the robot that is higher than the number of simultaneous
   commands of the joystick. Among the emerging solutions, the eyetracking,
   which identifies the user gaze direction, is expected to automatically
   command some of the robot DoFs. However, the use of eyetracking in three
   dimensions (3D) still gives large and variable errors from several
   centimeters to several meters. The objective of this paper, is to
   combine eyetracking and computer vision to automate the approach of a
   robot to its targeted point by acquiring its 3D location. The
   methodology combines three steps : - A regular eyetracking device
   measures the user mean gaze direction. The field of view of the user is
   recorded using a webcam, and the targeted point identified by image
   analysis. - The distance between the target and the user is computed
   using geometrical reconstruction, providing a 3D location point for the
   target. On 3 trials, the error analysis reveals that the computed
   coordinates of the target 3D localization has an average error of 5.5cm,
   which is 92\% more accurate than using the eyetracking only for point of
   gaze calculation, with an estimated error of 72cm. Finally, we discuss
   an innovative way to complete the system with smart targets to overcome
   some of the current limitations of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates an optimization problem pertaining to the system
   outage probability minimization for a bi-directional relaying system.
   Unlike the currently published works, our system has asymmetric traffic
   demands, and each node in the system is subject to a peak-power limit.
   By exploiting short-term or long-term channel knowledge at the
   transmitters and with the support of the traffic knowledge, the
   optimization problem is solved analytically, resulting in two power
   allocation strategies, called short-term and long-term policies, with
   closed-form solutions for individual transmit-powers at the relay and
   the sources. Simulation results confirmed the effectiveness of the
   proposed policies. It is shown that the short-term policy can achieve a
   significant improvement in the performance of the outage probability,
   irrespective of symmetric or asymmetric traffics and channels, and
   meanwhile, the long-term policy is more suitable for asymmetric traffic
   and channel settings.}},

   development of microwave power harvesters (MPH), being assumed as an
   unavoidable inherent problem of matching networks. This paper makes use
   of a simple L-matching network to derive the optimum junction resistance
   of a rectifying diode and study the tradeoff between power conversion
   efficiency and matching network efficiency, in order to obtain the
   maximum total energy harvesting efficiency. Even though insertion losses
   are unavoidable, the need to find lower loss matching techniques is
   discussed, if the currently observed limitation of MPH-related
   microwave-to-DC power conversion efficiency is to be overcome.}},

Abstract = {{Diseased or damaged heart valve leaflets are amongst the major causes of
   illness and death globally. The currently available treatment of heart
   valve patients is to mend the damaged valves, but in most severe cases,
   heart valves require replacement since repair is not feasible. The
   survival of the patient, as well as implantation success rate, depends
   on the engineered heart valves to instantly ensure adequate mechanical
   support and function after surgery. Therefore, the engineered heart
   valves must demonstrate and preserve the biomechanical properties
   similar to those of native heart valves. In the current project, we aim
   to improve our understanding of the structural, mechanical and
   viscoelastic properties of heart valve leaflets. We aim to develop a new
   computational model for simulation of viscoelastic properties of heart
   valve leaflets. In the work reported here, native bovine heart valve
   leaflets were excised from bovine hearts, collected from local slaughter
   house in Beirut and cryopreserved as necessary. The oscillatory shear
   based viscoelastic properties were studied using a parallel plate
   rheometer. The critical parameters such as, modulus of elasticity,
   ultimate tensile strength, maximum elongation and the stress-strain
   relationships as well as the oscillatory shear properties were
   investigated. Furthermore, an FEM based tri-layer composite model is
   being developed for computational studies of heart valve viscoelastic
   properties using finite element code ABAQUS. The developed model will be
   validated against the rheological behavior obtained from experiments.
   The new model and the obtained results will provide significant insights
   into the correlations between the nano-microstructure and biomechanics
   of the heart valves and their macroscale behaviors under different
   healthy and pathological conditions. The proper understanding of the
   correlations between nano-biomechanics and pathological conditions can
   also pave the ways for generations of new therapeutics for various
   cardiovascular diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Cry segmentation is an essential preprocessing step in any infant crying
   diagnosis system. Besides crying sounds consisting of expiration phases
   followed by short periods of inspiration episodes, each recording of
   newborn cries also includes silence sections as well as other sounds
   such as speech of caregivers, noise and sound of medical equipments.
   This paper is devoted to a newly developed Empirical Mode Decomposition
   (EMD) application to cry segmentation. The goal of the segmentation is
   to detect cry episodes automatically from unimportant acoustic
   activities existed inside the recorded signals. EMD decomposes a
   multicomponent non stationary signal into a set of monocomponent signals
   called Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). The cry signals are segmented
   using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) applied to the features extracted by
   employing EMD combined with Mel-Frequency Cepstral coefficients to the
   recorded cry signals. The performance of the proposed approach is
   evaluated on a database of 200 cry signals recorded in a real clinical
   environment. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
   suitability of the proposed method for the automatic cry segmentation.}},

   operandi: the working modes. A working mode models the way the operator
   divides up his interventions between the machines. The processing times
   thus become variable as they now depend on the working mode being
   utilized. To build a schedule, we seek not only a partition of the jobs
   on the machines, but also a subset of working modes along with their
   duration. A pseudo -polynomial time algorithm is exhibited to generate
   an optimal solution within the free changing mode. Polynomial and and
   fully polynomial approximation scheme algorithms (respectively PTAS and

   capabilities. As the likelihood of transient errors due to radiation is
   environment- and component-specific, we use machine learning to estimate
   the actual fault-rate of the system. Furthermore, we leverage
   probability theory to define a trade-off between power consumption and
   fault-tolerance. If a processing element fails, our methodology is able
   to re-map the application, establishing whether the real-time
   requirements will still be met, and how reliable the new, impaired
   system will be. Results show that the proposed methodology is able to
   adjust mapping and operating frequencies in order to maintain a fixed
   level of reliability for different fault-rates.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a numerical and experimental assessment of a plasma
   actuation concept for controlling corner stall separation in a
   highly-loaded compressor cascade. CFD simulations were first carried out
   to assess actuator effectiveness and determine the best actuation
   parameters. Subsequently, experiments were performed to demonstrate the
   concept and confirmed the CFD tool validity at a Reynolds number of
   1.5x10(5). Finally, the validated CFD tool was used to simulate the
   concept at higher velocities, beyond the experimental capability of
   existing plasma actuators. These results were used to obtain a
   preliminary scaling law that would allow approximation of the plasma
   actuation requirements at realistic operating conditions. Several
   configurations were examined, but the most effective setup was found to
   be when plasma actuators were mounted upstream of the separation point
   on both the suction surface and the endwall. Most of the improvement in
   total pressure loss stemmed from the suction surface actuator.
   Comparison with experimental data showed that the CFD simulations could
   capture the flow features and the effect of plasma actuation reasonably
   well. Simulations at higher flow velocities indicated that the required
   plasma actuator strength scales approximately with the square of the
   Reynolds number.}},

Abstract = {{A systematic numerical study has been carried out to investigate the
   effects of casing treatment slots geometry and location on the stall
   margin and peak efficiency of an isolated mixed-flow rotor at high
   subsonic flow conditions. Based on the literature review for axial
   rotor, a semi-circular axial skewed slot casing treatment placed in the
   leading edge region was chosen as the starting configuration as it has
   the best potential of producing stall margin improvement with low peak
   efficiency loss. A computational parametric study was performed from
   this baseline casing treatment geometry to identify the most important
   geometrical design parameters and to arrive at a design with noticeable
   stall margin improvement and no loss in peak efficiency. The results
   show that the design parameters with the largest impact on stall margin
   improvement and peak efficiency are: open area ratio, slot skew angle,
   slot axial length and slot axial position. The slots depth and slot
   shape seem to have only limited influence on performance. While not yet
   optimized, a slot casing treatment design with significant stall margin
   improvement and no loss in peak efficiency was obtained. To the authors'
   knowledge, this work is the most extensive slot casing treatments
   parametric study so far in term of number of design parameters
   considered.}},

   two flow features and explain the associated flow physics by variations
   in incoming meridional momentum and pitch size. Finally, two designs
   were proposed, namely full forward chordwise sweep and partially low

Abstract = {{A methodology is proposed and developed for the simulation of post-surge
   condition in a multi-stage compressor that is part of a gas generator
   system that also includes the combustor and turbine and ducts. Given the
   essentially one-dimensional nature of surge, the approach basically
   consists of coupling single blade passage multi-stage RANS CFD
   simulations of the compressor for with 1D equations modelling the
   behaviour of the other components applied as dynamic boundary
   conditions. This method allows for the simulation of the flow, behaviour
   inside a multi-stage compressor during surge and, by extension, for the
   prediction at the design phase of the time variation of aerodynamic
   forces on the blades and of the pressure and temperature at bleed
   locations inside the compressor used for turbine cooling. The main
   advantages of this method over existing methods are its relatively
   modest computational time and resource requirements and the fact that it
   does not require any empirical data input beyond what is used in
   standard CFD simulations.
   The method is implemented in a commercial CFD code (ANSYS CFX) and
   applied to three compressor geometries with distinct features.
   Simulations on a low-speed (incompressible) three stage axial compressor
   allows for a validation with experimental data, which shows that the
   proposed methodology captures the surge behaviour of the system very
   well both qualitatively and quantitatively. This comparison also
   highlights the strong dependence of the surge cycle frequency on the
   volume of the downstream plenum (combustion chamber). Subsequently, the
   addition of a low speed centrifugal compressor to the previous
   compressor is used to demonstrate the adaptability of the approach to a
   multistage axial-centrifugal configuration, yielding qualitatively
   realistic surge results. Finally, application of the method to an
   industrial transonic compressor geometry demonstrates the tool on a
   mixed flow-centrifugal compressor configuration operating in a highly
   compressible flow regime. A comparison of predicted versus measured
   shaft loading amplitude during surge is highly promising.}},

Abstract = {{Rotating stall is a well-known aerodynamic instability in compressors
   that limits the operating envelope of aircraft gas turbine engines. An
   innovative method for delaying the most common form of rotating stall
   inception using an annular DBD (Dielectric Barrier Discharge) plasma
   actuator had been proposed. A DBD plasma actuator is a simple
   solid-state device that converts electricity directly into flow
   acceleration through partial air ionization. However, the proposed
   concept had only been preliminarily evaluated with numerical simulations
   on an isolated axial rotor using a relatively basic CFD code. This paper
   provides both an experimental and a numerical assessment of this concept
   for an axial compressor stage as well as a centrifugal compressor stage,
   with both stages being part of a low-speed two-stage axial-centrifugal
   compressor test rig. The two configurations studied are the two-stage
   configuration with a 100 mN/m annular casing plasma actuator placed just
   upstream of the axial rotor leading edge, and the single-stage
   centrifugal compressor with the same actuator placed upstream of the
   impeller leading edge. The tested configurations were simulated with a
   commercial RANS CFD code (ANSYS CFX) in which was implemented the latest
   engineering DBD plasma model and dynamic throttle boundary condition,
   using single passage multiple blade row computational domains. The CFD
   simulations indicate that in both types of compressors the actuator
   delays the stall inception by pushing the incoming/tip clearance flow
   interface downstream into the blade passage. In each case, the predicted
   reduction in stalling mass flow matches the experimental value
   reasonably well.}},

   The developed techniques have been simulated in the MATLAB-Simulink
   environment to show the method for which the performances of PV system
   are increased. The results obtained, revealed the performance of the

Abstract = {{We propose to synthesize a parametric metasurface whose transmission
   properties are modified by illuminating a control electromagnetic wave
   on the structure, in the same way the channel conductance of a
   transistor is controlled by a gate signal. We present a general solution
   of the problem that yields analytical expressions for the synthesized
   metasurface susceptibilities. It turns out that such a problem generally
   violates reciprocity conditions, indicating the necessity of
   nonreciprocal elements. Nevertheless, we propose here a reciprocal
   parametric metasurface based on the destructive interference of
   transmitted waves corresponding to the initial signal wave and the
   control wave, respectively, at the cost of parasitic reflected and
   transmitted fields.}},

Abstract = {{Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. This
   disease includes chronic total occlusion (CTO), which is a complete
   blockage of an artery. Unlike partial occlusions, CTOs are difficult to
   cross percutaneously using conventional guidewires (thin and flexible
   wires) because of the fibrotic and calcified nature of the blockage. The
   lack of data regarding the mechanical properties of CTO limits the
   development of new technologies in the field of percutaneous coronary
   intervention (PCI) and percutaneous peripheral intervention (PPI). In
   this study, calcified plaques retrieved from occluded arteries are
   analyzed in order to better understand their mechanical properties and
   to help propose an artificial analogue. Calcified plaques samples were
   collected from the superficial femoral artery wall within one hour
   following a lower limb amputation surgery. These samples were studied to
   determine their composition and mechanical properties. The same
   characterization procedures were performed on various potential
   artificial analogues. These analogues include three plaster materials
   and dense hydroxyapatite blocks. The results were then compared with
   those of the calcified plaques in order to determine the more favorable
   analogue. This mechanical analysis and the proposal of a potential
   analogue for the calcified plaques found in occluded arteries could
   benefit the development of new technologies and devices in the field PCI
   and PPI.}},

Abstract = {{A Hybrid friction model has recently been developed by Azizian and
   Mureithi {[}1] to simulate the general friction behavior between
   surfaces in contact. However, identification of the model parameters
   remains an unresolved problem.
   To identify the parameters of the friction model, the following
   quantities are required: contact forces (friction and impact forces),
   the slip velocity and displacement in the contact region. Direct
   measurement of these quantities is difficult. In the present work, a
   beam clamped at one end and simply supported with the consideration of
   friction effect at the other is used as a mechanical amplifier of the
   friction effects at the microscopic level. Using this simplified
   approach, the contact forces, the sliding velocity and the displacement
   can be indirectly obtained by measuring the beam vibration response.
   A new method based on nonlinear modal analysis to calculate the contact
   forces is developed in the present work. The method is based on the
   modal superposition principle and Fourier series expansion.
   For the harmonic balance method, two approaches were tested. The
   approach based on sub-harmonic forms gave the best results.
   Signal reconstruction made it possible to accurately identify the
   parameters of the hybrid friction model with a multiple step approach.}},

Abstract = {{Fluid-structure interaction (PSI) and unavoidable vibrations are
   important characteristics in the operation of hydropower structures and
   must be taken into account in the analysis and design of such equipment.
   Hydrodynamic damping influences the amplitude of vibrations and is
   directly related to fatigue problems in hydraulic machines which are of
   great importance. The aim of this study is to investigate the coupled
   effects of flowing fluid on a simplified hydrofoil by using
   three-dimensional two-way fluid-structure interaction modeling, in order
   to determine its importance in predicting vibration amplitudes and
   damping. The effect of considering different flow velocities is also
   investigated in the present study. The results of this research are
   compared with those obtained from experiments done by ANDRITZ {[}1]. The
   influences of mesh size and time step are also studied. Our results
   indicate that considering PSI in predicting the frequencies of the
   fluctuating fluid forces in practical problems might be ignored if the
   main concern of the analysis is to check the possibility of resonance.
   However, FSI must be included in the modeling when we aim to predict the
   influence of the fluid on the damping behavior in the hydrofoil
   vibration.}},

Abstract = {{Pulsed Eddy Current (PEC) is a non-destructive testing method used to
   detect corrosion and cracks in multilayer aluminum structures which are
   typically found in aircraft applications. Corrosion and metal loss in
   thin multi-layer structures are complex and variable phenomena that
   diminish the reliability of pulsed eddy current measurements. In this
   paper, the Pulsed Eddy Current signals are processed to improve the
   accuracy and reliability of these measurements. PEC's results (time
   domain data) are converted by Time-Frequency Analysis (Rihaczek
   distribution) to represent data in three dimensions. The Time-Frequency
   approach generates a large amount of data. Principal component analysis
   (PCA) is applied as feature extraction to reduce redundant data to
   provide new features for classifiers. K-means Clustering and
   Expectation-Maximization are applied to classify data and automatically
   determine corrosion distribution in each layer. A set of tests has been
   carried out to detect the defects located at different depths and
   different positions of a multilayer aluminum plate.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud Patterns are abstract solutions to recurrent design problems in
   the cloud. Previous work has shown that these patterns can improve the
   Quality of Service (QoS) of cloud applications but their impact on
   energy consumption is still unknown. Yet, energy consumption is the
   biggest challenge that cloud computing systems (the backbone of today's
   high-tech economy) face today. In fact, 10\% of the world's electricity
   is now being consumed by servers, laptops, tablets and smartphones.
   Energy consumption has complex dependencies on the hardware platform,
   and the multiple software layers. The hardware, its firmware, the
   operating system, and the various software components used by a cloud
   application, all contribute to determining the energy footprint. Hence,
   even though increasing a data center efficiency will eventually improve
   energy efficiency, the internal design of cloud-based applications can
   be improved to lower energy consumption. In this paper, we conduct an
   empirical study on a RESTful multi-threaded application deployed in the
   cloud, to investigate the individual and the combined impact of three
   cloud patterns (e.g., Local Database proxy, Local Shard ing Based Router
   and Priority Queue) on the energy consumption of cloud based
   applications. We measure the energy consumption using Power-API; an
   application programming interface (API) written in Java to monitor the
   energy consumed at the process level. Results show that cloud patterns
   can effectively reduce the energy consumption of a cloud application,
   but not in all cases. In general, there appear to he a trade-off between
   an improved response lane of the application and the energy consumption.
   Developers and software architects can make use of these results to
   guide their design decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Implementing the integrated forest biorefinery is a potentially
   effective way to diversify the product portfolio of the Canadian pulp
   and paper (P\&P) industry and generate new revenues. However, it is
   subject to constraints and limitations. One constraint is high energy
   efficiency to ensure independence from fossil fuels. To achieve this
   goal, a new innovative methodology for analyzing the energy efficiency
   of water-based P\&P processes has been developed and validated. Specific
   features of this methodology include combined steam and water systems
   analysis, a project-oriented approach, and use of heuristic rules. This
   report presents the results of applying this original methodology to the
   energy efficiency of three operating Canadian Kraft pulp mills with
   different configurations: a dissolving pulp mill, a standard Kraft mill
   combined with a mechanical pulping line, and a twin-line standard Kraft
   mill. The energy efficiency enhancement programs developed using this
   methodology could, if implemented, produce steam and water use
   reductions far superior to those obtained by current engineering
   practice: 30\% to 40\% for steam and 25\% to 50\% for water. The method
   has revealed large differences between the three mills in steam and
   water use. The proposed energy enhancement program would enable the
   mills to shut down permanently their current natural gas-fired power
   boilers, to support integrated biorefineries producing biofuels or other
   bioproducts, and to increase their electricity production. Implementing
   efficiency-enhancement programs in stand-alone Kraft mills (i.e.,
   without biorefineries) would have an attractive cost recovery period,
   varying from less than one year to about three years.}},

Abstract = {{An ambitious project in propulsion was introduced as part of the
   final-year integrator project offerings of the mechanical and aerospace
   engineering programs at Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal in 2011-2012. It
   has been running successfully for the past three academic years. The
   project consists in the design, fabrication and placement into service
   of a functional instrumented multi-stage compressor test rig, including
   the compressor, for research in compressor aerodynamics. A team of 15-17
   senior-year undergraduate engineering students are given set of design
   and performance specifications and measurement requirements, an electric
   motor and drive, a data acquisition system and some measurement probes.
   They must complete the project in two semesters with a budget on the
   order of Can\$15,000. The compressor is made from rapid prototyping to
   keep production cost and time reasonable. However, its required rotation
   speed of 7200 rpm stretches the limits of the plastic material and
   presents the same structural challenges as industrial compressors
   running at higher speeds.
   The students are split into sub-teams according to the required
   disciplines, namely compressor aerodynamics, general aerodynamics,
   structures, dynamics, mechanical design and integration, instrumentation
   and project management. For the initial phase, which covers the first
   two months, the students receive short seminars from experts in academia
   and industry in each discipline and use the knowledge from fundamental
   engineering courses to analytically model the different components to
   come up with a preliminary design. In the second phase, covering months
   three through six, the students are trained at commercial simulation
   tools and use them for detailed analysis to refine and finalize the
   design. In each of the first two phases, the students present their work
   in design reviews with a jury made up of engineers from industry and
   supervising professors. During the final phase, the compressor is built
   and tested with data acquisition and motor control programs written by
   the students. Finally, the students present their results with
   comparison of measured performance with numerical and analytical
   predictions from the first two phases and hand over their compressor rig
   with design and test reports as well as a user manual and an
   assembly/maintenance manual.
   This complete project allows the students to put into practice virtually
   all the courses of their undergraduate engineering curriculum while
   giving them an extensive taste of the rich and intellectually
   challenging environment of gas turbine and turbomachinery engineering.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a 60 GHz short-range spatial multiplexing architecture
   for a 2 x 2 MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) system is proposed and
   analyzed. High-speed communications can be achieved at 60 GHz thanks to
   the availability of 7 GHz of unlicensed bandwidth and strong free-space
   attenuation, allowing efficient spectrum reuse. Spatial multiplexing
   MIMO techniques can also be used to furher improve the data rate. A
   computer model using measured results of 8 patches microstrip antenna
   array for both transmitter and receiver antennas is proposed to analyze
   a MIMO spatial multiplexing architecture which diagonalize the channel
   matrix in hardware, by tuning certain physical parameters. This method
   avoids the conventional MIMO signal processing which requires high speed
   embedded DSP. Measurement results of the spatial multiplexing systems
   are also presented. This study proves that the capacity of the proposed
   MIMO system can be considerably increased compared to SISO
   (Single-Input-Single-Output) under certain conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Functional parameters of six-port demodulator are studied in this paper.
   Indeed, noise figure (NF), conversion loss and inter-modulation
   products, which are the key parameters of a mixer, are derived through
   theoretical analysis and validated by simulations. In order to reduce
   the conversion loss while keeping the power detector's working condition
   in the square law region and maintain the benefits of low-power LO, the
   detector biasing technique is also investigated. Also, by modeling the
   sixport interferometer as a mixer, a platform of extracting a set of
   equivalent mixer parameters through circuit simulations is proposed. As
   a case study, the proposed technique is applied to extract the mixer
   model of a six-port interferometer demodulator operating in E-band with
   a commercial diode of Avago HSCH-9161. Such a modeling technique
   provides RF receiver designers a quantitative way of understanding the
   six-port interferometer demodulators and comparing them with traditional
   mixer-based zero-IF demodulators.}},

Abstract = {{Structured business processes (SBPs) are now in enterprises the
   prominent solution to software development problems through
   orchestrating Web services. By their very nature, SBPs evolve through
   adding new or modifying existing functionalities. Those changes may
   deteriorate the process design and introduce process antipatterns-poor
   but recurring solutions that may degrade processes design quality and
   hinder their maintenance and evolution. However, to date, few solutions
   exist to detect such antipatterns to facilitate the maintenance and
   evolution and improve the quality of process design. We propose SODA-BP
   (Service Oriented Detection for Antipatterns in Business Processes),
   supported by a framework for specifying and detecting process
   antipatterns. To validate SODA-BP, we specify eight antipatterns and
   perform their detection on a set of randomly selected 35 SBPs form a
   corpus of more than 150 collected processes from an open-source search
   engine. Some of the SBPs were modified by adding, removing, or modifying
   process elements to introduce noise in them. Results shows that SODA-BP
   has an average detection precision of more than 75\% and recall of
   100\%.}},

Abstract = {{The Grenville Province in Quebec has a long Mesoproterozoic history of
   accretionary events, along the full length of the southeastern margin of
   Laurentia, that culminated in the Grenvillian Orogeny between 1090 and
   980 Ma. It contains many alkaline and carbonatitic magmatic complexes
   complemented with widespread REE-rich pegmatites, which makes it an
   economic target for magmatic Rare-Earth Elements (REE) mineralization.
   Preliminary field investigations in the Lac Okaopeo region (Cote-Nord,
   south from the Manicouagan impact, Quebec) particularly rich in REE-rich
   pegmatites, show that these dykes are REE-rich undeformed pegmatite
   dykes which seem to be late- to post-orogenic according to their
   undeformed state and crosscutting relationships with the surrounding
   foliation. These dykes are rooted in migmatites representing partial
   melting of the middle crust under P-T conditions up to granulite facies
   and are intrusive upsection in the upper continental crust (in
   metasedimentary complexes). From the middle to the upper crust,
   pegmatite aspect evolves concurrently with the REE-minerals, from
   allanite-rich pinkish dykes to monazite bearing white pegmatites.
   Further mineralogical, textural and geochronological investigations will
   be conducted in order to complement these preliminary field
   observations.}},

Abstract = {{We study the convex hull of the intersection of a convex set E and a
   disjunctive set. This intersection is at the core of solution techniques
   for Mixed Integer Convex Optimization. We prove that if there exists a
   cone K (resp., a cylinder C) that has the same intersection with the
   boundary of the disjunction as E, then the convex hull is the
   intersection of E with K (resp., C).
   The existence of such a cone (resp., a cylinder) is difficult to prove
   for general conic optimization. We prove existence and unicity of a
   second order cone (resp., a cylinder), when E is the intersection of an
   affine space and a second order cone (resp., a cylinder). We also
   provide a method for finding that cone, and hence the convex hull, for
   the continuous relaxation of the feasible set of a Mixed Integer Second
   Order Cone Optimization (MISOCO) problem, assumed to be the intersection
   of an ellipsoid with a general linear disjunction. This cone provides a
   new conic cut for MISOCO that can be used in branch- and- cut algorithms
   for MISOCO problems.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a mixed interior/exterior-point method for nonlinear
   programming that handles constraints by way of an l(1)-penalty function.
   The penalty problem is reformulated as a smooth inequality-constrained
   problem that always possesses bounded multipliers, and that may be
   solved using interior-point techniques as finding a strictly feasible
   point is trivial. If finite multipliers exist for the original problem,
   exactness of the penalty function eliminates the need to drive the
   penalty parameter to infinity. If the penalty parameter needs to
   increase without bound and if feasibility is ultimately attained, a
   certificate of degeneracy is delivered. Global and fast local
   convergence of the proposed scheme are established and practical aspects
   of the method are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Products evoke emotions in people. Emotions can influence purchase
   decisions and product evaluations. It is widely acknowledged that better
   product performance and higher user satisfaction can be reached through
   aesthetic design. However, when designing a new product, most of the
   attention is generally paid to enhance its functionality and usability
   and much less consideration is given to the emotional needs of users.
   This paper investigates the connection between emotions and product
   features. Various fauns of vases are used as a product case.
   Additionally, a compact list of product-specific semantic descriptors is
   first developed using a classification based on Jordan's four pleasures
   model. Paper-based surveys, face-to-face interviews, and statistical
   methods were performed in this paper, where significant correlations
   between semantic descriptors and product geometry were found. Prototypes
   of two vases were developed based on elicited emotions and a short
   validation on aesthetic value was performed. Our results show core set
   of geometric features of a vase have the strongest impact on emotional
   responses from users: the opening of the neck, the height of the neck,
   the base of the neck (width), and the base (width).}},

Abstract = {{Mechatronic systems are of increased importance in engineering and their
   relevance goes hand in hand with the increasing complexity of the tasks
   they perform. Due to the inherent complexity of mechatronic systems, a
   concurrent systematic and multi-objective design thinking methodology is
   crucial to replace the often used sequential design approach that tends
   to deal with the different domains separately. In this research we
   present a new multi-criteria profile (MMP) for mechatronic system
   performance evaluation in the stage of conceptual design. Based on the
   assessed MMP for each of generated design concepts and using a method of
   aggregation for interacting criteria, a global performance index will be
   calculated. Best mechatronic configurations are determined by maximizing
   this performance index. In the presented paper two nonlinear fuzzy
   integrals called 2-additive Choquet and Sugeno will be used for the
   aggregation of criteria and fitting the intuitive requirements for
   decision-making in the presence of interacting criteria. Finally, the
   effectiveness of the proposed design method alongside each of the
   decision making models will be validated via a case study of designing a
   robotic visual servoing system. The comparative simulation results for
   the overall system performance will also be presented for both cases of
   using Choquet and Sugeno integrals.}},

Abstract = {{A hybrid friction model was recently developed by Azizian and Mureithi
   {[}1] to simulate the friction behavior of tube support interaction.
   However, identification of the model parameters remains unresolved.
   In previous work, the friction model parameters were identified using
   reverse the harmonic method, where the following quantities were
   indirectly obtained by measuring the vibration response of a beam:
   friction force, sliding speed of the force of impact and local
   displacement at the contact point. In the present work, the simulation
   by the finite element method (FEM) of a beam clamped at one end and
   simply supported with the consideration of friction effect at the other
   is conducted. This beam is used to validate the inverse harmonic balance
   method and the parameters of the friction models identified previously.
   Two static friction models (the Coulomb model and Stribeck model) are
   tested. The two models produce friction forces of the correct order of
   magnitude compared to the friction force calculated using the inverse
   harmonic balance method. However, the models cannot accurately reproduce
   the beam response; the Stribeck friction model is shown to give the
   response closer to experiments.
   The results demonstrate some of the challenges associated with accurate
   friction model parameter identification using the inverse harmonic
   balance method. The present work is an intermediate step toward
   identification of the hybrid friction model parameters and, longer term,
   improved analysis of tube support dynamic behavior under the influence
   of friction.}},

Abstract = {{Nuclear steam generator tubes in two-phase cross-flow may vibrate due to
   excitations that emanate from various sources. Of these excitation
   mechanisms, fluidelastic instability is the most dominant cause of tube
   failures in the short-term. These failures, other than leading to
   unscheduled plant shutdowns, may result in leakage of radioactive
   materials that may ultimately cause accidents and economic loss.
   Very limited work has been dedicated to investigating purely streamwise
   fluidelastic instability in tube arrays. However, recent observations of
   tube failure caused by streamwise or in-plane instability confirm the
   importance of streamwise fluidelastic instability analysis.
   In the present study, we present detailed dynamic cross coupling force
   and phase measurement results for a central cluster of tubes in a
   rotated triangular tube array of Pitch-to-Diameter ratio (P/D)=1.5
   subjected to air-water two-phase cross-flow, for homogeneous void
   fractions of 0\% and 60\%. The measured dynamic forces together with
   previously measured quasi-steady forces are necessary to estimate the
   time delay which is an important input for the quasi-steady fluidelastic
   instability model.}},

Abstract = {{In nuclear power plants, heat exchangers undergo important flow induced
   vibrations, fluidelastic instability (FEI) being the most damaging one.
   Direct numerical simulations of such a phenomenon is currently an
   impossible task because of the considerable number of tubes and the
   two-phase nature of the flow.
   The novelty of the present approach is to use a porous medium to model
   the tube bundle and the surrounding flow. The Navier-Stokes equations
   are averaged on a control volume and the tubes materialized by a
   porosity field and source terms that model the interactions between the
   fluid and the solid. New sets of fully coupled equations were developed
   and solved with a finite element solver using high order time
   integration schemes. The unsteady porous medium approach already
   developed for single-phase flow is extended to the Euler-Euler
   formulation to describe the two-phase mixture. Validation and
   calibration of the parameters are achieved by comparing the critical
   flow rate and the forces acting on the tubes with results from direct
   numerical simulations and experimental data for single-phase flows.}},

Abstract = {{Identifier lexicon has a direct impact on software understandability and
   reusability and, thus, on the quality of the final software product.
   Understandability and reusability are two important characteristics of
   software quality. REST (REpresentational State Transfer) style is
   becoming a de facto standard adopted by many software organisations. The
   use of proper lexicon in RESTful APIs might make them easier to
   understand and reuse by client developers, and thus, would ease their
   adoption. Linguistic antipatterns represent poor practices in the
   naming, documentation, and choice of identifiers in the APIs as opposed
   to linguistic patterns that represent best practices. We present the
   DOLAR approach (Detection Of Linguistic Antipatterns in REST), which
   applies syntactic and semantic analyses for the detection of linguistic
   (anti) patterns in RESTful APIs. We provide detailed definitions of ten
   (anti) patterns and define and apply their detection algorithms on 15
   widely-used RESTful APIs, including Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. The
   results show that DOLAR can indeed detect linguistic (anti) patterns
   with high accuracy and that they do occur in major RESTful APIs.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-objective and multi-point optimization methodology is developed
   for aerodynamic design of transonic fan blades. The optimization method
   aims to increase design efficiency, near stall efficiency and stall
   margin while maintaining the required design pressure ratio and high
   speed choke margin. Numerical analyses are performed by solving
   three-dimensional Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations combined
   with shear stress turbulence model. A multi-level blade parameterization
   is employed to modify the blade geometry. The proposed method is applied
   to redesign NASA rotor 67. First, an optimization case with considering
   two operating conditions at peak efficiency and near stall is performed
   to demonstrate the relation between near stall efficiency and stall
   margin. An investigation on Pareto optimal solutions of this
   optimization shows that the stall margin is increased with improving
   near stall efficiency. Then, in order to maintain the required choke
   margin, an operating point at high speed choked flow is added to the
   optimization process. A final optimized design is selected by
   considering the interaction of design requirements at all three
   operating points. The new design presents higher efficiency and stall
   margin without any reduction in the chocking mass flow rate.}},

Abstract = {{Wear of materials is a serious problem facing industry especially in
   mechanical applications where moving parts are continuously subjected to
   friction. Hard coatings prepared by a variety of processes are nowadays
   considered as effective solutions to protect components against wear.
   Examples of such processes are: thermal spray coating, vacuum-based
   coating and hardfacing. In this paper, we study the mechanical,
   tribological and corrosion properties of two hard coating systems: CoCr
   Stellite 6 (ST6) hardfacing on 316 stainless steel and NiWCrB Colmonoy
   88 (C88) thermal spray coating on Inconel 718. The effect of gas
   nitriding on the microstructure and wear performance of these coating
   systems is investigated. X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive
   spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used for
   microstructural analysis. Micro-indentation technique was utilized to
   measure the surface and cross-sectional hardness of the coatings.
   Rockwell indentation technique was used to evaluate coating adhesion in
   accordance with CEN/TS 1071-8. Pin-on-disk tests were conducted to
   assess the tribologidal performance of the coatings. Microstructural
   analysis showed that ST6 has a cobalt matrix in the form of dendrites
   reinforced with metal carbide particles whereas C88 has a Nickel matrix
   reinforced mainly with metal boride particles. ST6 and C88 improved
   significantly the wear resistance of their corresponding substrates.
   This is mainly due to good adhesion and high hardness of the coatings;
   HR15N values of ST6 and C88 were almost 85 as compared to 61 and 80 for
   316 and INC substrates, respectively. ST6 was found to improve
   significantly the corrosion resistance of 316 whereas C88 decreased the
   corrosion performance of INC. Moreover, nitriding treatment was found to
   improve significantly the wear resistance of 316 and INC, however, in
   the case of ST6, nitriding was beneficial in terms of wear resistance
   only at relatively low load.}},

Abstract = {{Galling of materials is a severe surface damage characterized by
   macroscopic material removal when two solid surfaces experience relative
   sliding under high load. This mode of wear is of particular interest in
   applications where design constraints require assembly components to
   slide against each other without adequate lubrication. Examples are
   high-pressure ball valve with metal-to-metal seal contact, sheet metal
   forming process and medical/food processing instruments where
   lubrication is sometimes non-existent due contamination concerns. In
   addition to sliding at high load, materials in these applications can be
   exposed to aggressive environments which lead to combined tribological
   and corrosive degradation phenomena. Progress in this field depends
   largely on the understanding of the interaction between corrosion and
   wear processes. In this paper, we describe a new testing instrument
   capable of testing galling and sliding wear behavior under dry and wet
   conditions. Design of this instrument is guided by ASTM standards G98
   for galling, G99 for pin-on-disk, G133 for ball-on-flat and G199 for
   tribocorrosion.
   Galling configuration consists of two concentrically aligned hollow
   cylindrical specimen loaded along their longitudinal axis with constant
   load (max 5000 N). The upper specimen is held stationary while the lower
   specimen is rotated a number of cycles at a selected speed. During the
   test, the friction torque is measured using special torque/thrust load
   cell. For the combined galling/corrosion test, the specimen's contact
   surface is submerged in an electrolytic solution and three electrode
   type electrochemical cell is set-up using the specimens as working
   electrode. Galling/corrosion tests can be performed under open circuit
   potential or under controlled potentials. In the first type, the
   corrosion potential is monitored before, during and after rubbing,
   whereas in the second type, the corrosion potential and corrosion
   current are controlled before, during and after rubbing. In addition to
   galling, the instrument can also be used to conduct pin-on-disk and
   ball-on flat tests under dry and wet conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The multiscale structure of spider silk is widely studied because of its
   superior mechanical properties. Its high tenacity allows the absorption
   of the kinetic energy of fast and large preys. The mechanism of
   sacrificial bonds enhances the stretchability and toughness of spider
   capture-silk. With this in mind, we fabricate microstructured fibers
   with sacrificial bonds using the dragged viscous thread instability. A
   thread of viscous liquid flowing towards a perpendicular moving platform
   buckles repetitively and creates different periodical patterns. A
   solution of 25\% polylactid acid (PLA) dissolved in the dichloromethane
   (DCM) is extruded from a 30 mu m diameter needle onto a moving platform.
   By decreasing the speed ratio between the thread extrusion speed and the
   platform moving speed, we obtain different instability patterns:
   catenary, meandering, alternating (loop falling on alternate sides of
   the main thread), and coiling (all the loops falling on the same side).
   The spatial frequency of the periodical patterns linearly increases with
   the speed ratio until overlapping occurs. When the thread loops on
   itself, it welds and fuses with itself to form a bond which solidifies
   as the solvent evaporates and the thread dries. Different fiber patterns
   are tested in an electromechanical tensile machine and their performance
   are compared to a straight fiber. Sacrificial bonds require significant
   energy to break (i.e., ranging between 0 to 110\% of the yield value of
   a straight fiber). Finally by controlling the instability parameters, we
   are able to tailor the mechanical properties of the resulting fibers
   such as its breaking strain, rigidity and toughness which could lead to
   different protective wear applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) time
   driven RCCP model that handles different planning levels by varying the
   length of the time periods. The model is based on the continuous time
   representation of work packages' start and end events and the discrete
   time representation of resource constraints. The model considers shorter
   period lengths at the beginning of the planning horizon to produce a
   detailed plan, while further periods cover a larger span. The proposed
   model is compared to a RCCP model with fixed period lengths. Both models
   were tested on medium-sized project instances. The computational results
   proved that the proposed model performs considerably better in terms of
   computational times. A reactive planning approach is also proposed to
   analyze the performance and robustness of both models. The results
   analysis showed that reducing resource capacities of aggregated periods

Abstract = {{Background: Living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) necessitates
   long-term health care follow-up, particularly with respect to
   antiretroviral therapy (ART) management. Taking advantage of the
   enormous possibilities afforded by information and communication
   technologies (ICT), we developed a virtual nursing intervention
   (VIH-TAVIE) intended to empower HIV patients to manage their ART and
   their symptoms optimally. ICT interventions hold great promise across
   the entire continuum of HIV patient care but further research is needed
   to properly evaluate their effectiveness.
   Objective: The objective of the study was to compare the effectiveness
   of two types of follow-up-traditional and virtual-in terms of promoting
   ART adherence among HIV patients.
   Methods: A quasi-experimental study was conducted. Participants were 179
   HIV patients on ART for at least 6 months, of which 99 were recruited at
   a site offering virtual follow-up and 80 at another site offering only
   traditional follow-up. The primary outcome was medication adherence and
   the secondary outcomes were the following cognitive and affective
   variables: self-efficacy, attitude toward medication intake,
   symptom-related discomfort, stress, and social support. These were
   evaluated by self-administered questionnaire at baseline (T0), and 3
   (T3) and 6 months (T6) later.
   Results: On average, participants had been living with HIV for 14 years
   and had been on ART for 11 years. The groups were highly heterogeneous,
   differing on a number of sociodemographic dimensions: education, income,
   marital status, employment status, and living arrangements. Adherence at
   baseline was high, reaching 80\% (59/74) in the traditional follow-up
   group and 84\% (81/97) in the virtual follow-up group. A generalized
   estimating equations (GEE) analysis was run, controlling for
   sociodemographic characteristics at baseline. A time effect was detected
   indicating that both groups improved in adherence over time but did not
   differ in this regard. Improvement at 6 months was significantly greater
   than at 3 months in both groups. Analysis of variance revealed no
   significant group-by-time interaction effect on any of the secondary
   outcomes. A time effect was observed for the two kinds of follow-ups;
   both groups improved on symptom-related discomfort and social support.
   Conclusions: Results showed that both interventions improved adherence
   to ART. Thus, the two kinds of follow-up can be used to promote
   treatment adherence among HIV patients on ART.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a resources-optimized digital action potential (AP)
   detector featuring an adaptive threshold based on a new Sigma-delta
   control loop. The proposed AP detector is optimized for utilizing low
   hardware resources, which makes it suitable for implementation on most
   popular low-power microcontrollers units (MCU). The adaptive threshold
   is calculated using a digital control loop based on a Sigma-delta
   modulator that precisely estimates the standard deviation of the
   amplitude of the neuronal signal. The detector was implemented on a
   popular low-power MCU and fully characterized experimentally using
   previously recorded neural signals with different signal-to-noise
   ratios. A comparison of the obtained results with other thresholding
   approaches shows that the proposed method can compete with high
   performance and highly resources demanding spike detection approaches
   while achieving up to 100\% of true positive detection rate at high SNR,
   and up to 63\% for an SNR as low as 0 dB, while necessitating an
   execution time as low as 11 mu s with the MCU operating at 8 MHz.}},

Abstract = {{A 3D numerical simulation of a circular cylinder wake is presented in
   this paper. The cylinder is harmonically forced in the stream-wise
   direction. The objective of the present work is to investigate the
   effect of the oscillation amplitude on the secondary transition of the
   wake. The frequency of the lift force is then linked to the form of the
   vortex shedding mode. The relation between these vortex shedding modes
   using POD analysis of the transverse velocity and the unsteady lift
   coefficient of 3D simulation is in good agreement with the 2D model.
   Results show that the 3D spanwise effect, which can change the wake
   structure, is suppressed at Re = 200 by streamwise oscillation of the
   cylinder. Thus the 2D analysis can effectively model the temporal
   instability of the wake flow.}},

Abstract = {{Cosmic rays lead to soft errors and faulty behavior in electronic
   circuits. Knowing about their faulty behavior before fabrication would
   be helpful. This research proposes an approach for modeling the faulty
   behaviour of digital circuits. It could be applied in a design flow
   before circuit fabrication. This is achieved by extracting information
   about faulty behaviour of circuits from low-level models expressed in
   the VHDL language. Afterwards the extracted information is used to train
   high-level artificial neural networks models expressed in C/C++ or
   MATLABTM languages. The trained neural network models are able to
   replicate the behaviour of circuits in presence of faults. The
   methodology is based on experiments done with two benchmarks, the
   ISCAS-C17 and a 4-bit multiplier. Results show that the neural network
   approach leads to models that are more accurate than a previously
   reported signature generation method. For the C17, using only 30\% of
   the dataset generated with the LIFTING fault simulator, the neural
   network is able to replicate the output of the circuit in presence of
   faults with a mean absolute modeling error below 6\%.}},

Abstract = {{With the increasing integration of doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)
   based large wind farms, their impact on power system static and dynamic
   behavior is an issue of interest. Large wind farms are usually connected
   to grids using relatively long transmission lines or cables (weak
   grids). Therefore, the wind farm stable operation in weak grids must be
   researched. This paper proposes an adaptive DFIG line side converter
   (LSC) control, for stable operation of wind turbines connected to weak
   grids. Furthermore, as weak grids with relatively long transmission
   lines experience severe temporary overvoltages due to Ferranti effect,
   an overvoltage ride through (OVRT) strategy for the DFIG based wind farm
   is also proposed. The Senvion wind turbine control strategy is applied
   to demonstrate the workability of the proposed approaches.}},

Title = {{Development of Substrate-Integrated Waveguide Filters for Low-Cost
   High-Density RF and Microwave Circuit Integration: Direct-Coupled Cavity
   Bandpass Filters With Chebyshev Response}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Pages = {{1313-1325}},
Abstract = {{Direct-coupled cavity bandpass filters with Chebyshev response are
   studied and realized, using the technique of planar substrate-integrated
   waveguide (SIW) for the purpose of high-density integration and cost
   reduction. Using a general mode-matching technique, the scattering
   matrix of waveguide bifurcation type discontinuity and asymmetric iris
   are established and analyzed. Such discontinuities are used as coupling
   components and building blocks in the design of filters that are
   realized on RT/duroid 6002 with the ordinary printed circuit board
   process in our work. Measurement for one of the three four-pole filters
   gives 3.4 dB insertion loss and 17 dB return loss over the whole
   passband at near 24 GHz (K-band) with 440-MHz bandwidth (1.8\%). The
   design method can be widely adopted for the development of
   microwave-integrated circuits, and the mass-fabrication of such SIW
   filters can be made easy while maintaining a very low cost.}},

   Cognitive Radio Networks Considering Self-Interference}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Pages = {{2715-2729}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an adaptive medium access control (MAC)
   protocol for full-duplex (FD) cognitive radio networks in which FD
   secondary users (SUs) perform channel contention followed by concurrent
   spectrum sensing and transmission, and transmission only with maximum
   power in two different stages (called the FD sensing and transmission
   stages, respectively) in each contention and access cycle. The proposed
   FD cognitive MAC (I-DC-MAC) protocol does not require synchronization
   among SUs, and it efficiently utilizes the spectrum and mitigates the
   self-interference in the FD transceiver. We develop a mathematical model
   to analyze the throughput performance of the I-DC-MAC protocol, where
   both half-duplex (HD) transmission and FD transmission modes are
   considered in the transmission stage. Then, we study the FDC-MAC
   configuration optimization through adaptively controlling the spectrum
   sensing duration and transmit power level in the FD sensing stage. We
   prove that there exists optimal sensing time and transmit power to
   achieve the maximum throughput, and we develop an algorithm to configure
   the proposed I-DC-MAC protocol. Extensive numerical results are
   presented to illustrate the optimal FDC-MAC configuration and the
   impacts of protocol parameters and the self-interference cancellation
   quality on the throughput performance. Moreover, we demonstrate the
   significant throughput gains of the I-DC-MAC protocol with respect to
   the existing HD MAC and single-stage FD MAC protocols.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a multiple fault prognostic methodology which
   considers the condition monitoring data collected from equipment that
   experiences one of several different failure modes over its life span.
   The methodology is based on the exploitation of historical data for
   knowledge extraction and representation in the form of relevant
   patterns. Since the technique used is non statistical, none of the usual
   statistical assumptions, such as the independency of failure modes, are
   necessary. The idea of the proposed methodology is to merge the Logical
   Analysis of Data (LAD) approach with a set of non-parametric
   cause-specific survival functions. The former reflects the effect of the
   condition monitoring data of each failure mode, which is collected from
   the monitored equipment, on its failure time. The latter provides
   estimate of the marginal probability of each failure mode in the
   presence of the other competing failure modes. The results obtained show
   that the proposed methodology is capable of describing accurately the
   state of each individual equipment based on the collected condition
   monitoring data, and to use this information in order to provide
   accurate prognostics.}},

Abstract = {{While traditional maintenance cost optimization is based on finding the
   reliability, and thus the probability of failure over time, in this
   paper, we show how to exploit condition monitoring data in machining
   operation in order to extract intelligent knowledge, and use this
   knowledge to determine the tool replacement time. This work is motivated
   by the increasing use of sensors in general, and specifically in
   condition monitoring. We show how the large volume of data that is now
   available in many industrial sites can give indications to the
   machining's operator in order to replace the tool. We use a methodology
   called Logical Analysis of Data (LAD). This methodology enables us to
   extract meaningful patterns that describe the state of the tool's wear,
   based on monitoring and measuring the cutting forces. Unlike the
   traditional experts' rule-based methods, the extracted patterns are not
   based on experts' opinion, but on information and hidden relations
   between the monitored forces.
   We apply our methodology on data obtained from experiments that are
   conducted in the laboratory. The experimental data are collected during
   a turning process of titanium metal matrix composites (TiMMCs). These
   are new generation of materials which have proven to be viable in
   various industrial fields such as biomedical and aerospace, and they are
   very expensive.
   In order to validate our methodology, we compare the results obtained
   when applying LAD to those obtained by using the well-known statistical
   Proportional Hazards Model (PHM). Findings and conclusion are given in
   the paper.}},

   process. This feature allows an extremely fast sensitivity analysis and
   fabrication yield estimate in the case of a mass production. As an
   example, the sensitivity study of a cavity SIW filter is shown and
   discussed. Furthermore, the paper presents the comparison of the
   fabrication tolerance sensitivity between two filters with identical
   performance, fabricated in SIW and microstrip line technology,
   respectively. This comparison shows how the sensitivity of scattering
   parameters is significantly smaller in the SIW filter than in the

Abstract = {{A broadband balun structure is developed through a hybrid combination of
   substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) and antipodal fin-line topologies.
   The signal at the balanced port is divided between two unbalanced ports
   using a broadband SIW power divider which is capable of an equal power
   division with low phase and amplitude imbalance over a wide bandwidth.
   The 180 degrees phase difference is made by the rotation of E-field
   polarization through the antipodal fin-line sections in two unbalanced
   branches. Due to the independency of this phase shifting with respect to
   propagation constant and wavelength, a constant 180 degrees phase
   difference is achieved in a wide range of frequency. Using a printed
   circuit board (PCB) process, the proposed balun is prototyped and
   demonstrated for operation at millimeter-wave frequencies from 70 GHz to
   90 GHz. The measurement results show an excellent performance with very
   low insertion loss of less than 1 dB and 180 degrees phase difference

Abstract = {{In this paper, a 40 GHz zero-IF self-oscillating mixer (SOM) with
   low-power consumption, is proposed and demonstrated for the next
   generation of battery-free yet active mm-wave identification (MMID) tag.
   It exploits the mixing property of LC cross-coupled VCO, and by
   injection-locking the SOM to the reader's carrier frequency, it enables
   a direct-conversion to the baseband. It, therefore, does not require any
   external LO source (self-mixing) nor RF frequency conversion into IF
   frequency. A chip was designed using 65-nm CMOS process, and
   experimental results exhibit a conversion loss of about 29 dB, with a
   power consumption of only 280 mu W.}},

Title = {{A Comparative Study of Eye-In-Hand Image-Based Visual Servoing: Stereo
   vs. Mono}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED DESIGN \& PROCESS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{25-54}},
Abstract = {{Visual control of manipulators provides significant advantages when
   working with targets with unknown positions. Among all visual servoing
   categories, the stereo visual servoing has shown to be very effective
   when dealing with unstructured environments. In this paper a comparative
   study of eye-in-hand image-based visual servoing (IBVS) for two
   approaches of stereo and mono vision is presented and various cases of
   control schemes, and tracking and prediction algorithms are studied. In
   this study the vision systems are considered to be mounted on the
   end-effector of a 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) manipulator robot.
   Additionally, a method for position prediction and trajectory estimation
   of the moving target in order to use in a real-time catching task is
   proposed and developed using Kalman Filter and Extended Kalman Filter
   (EKF) as the trajectory estimators. Using the proposed estimation
   methods, the quality of the visual servoing in a catching procedure
   using a 6-DOF manipulator robot is compared for mono and stereo visual
   servoing systems. Finally, by applying the newly introduced acceleration
   command-based controller (AIBVS) to the visual servoing system, the
   results for both cases are presented to compare the effects on the
   quality of servoing tasks. The aforementioned scenarios of visual
   servoing are simulated and implemented based on a 6-DOF DENSO 6242G
   robot.}},

Title = {{Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System Models for Force Prediction of a
   Mechatronic Flexible Structure}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED DESIGN \& PROCESS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{77-94}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the results obtained from a research work
   investigating the performance of different Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy
   Inference System (ANFIS) models developed to predict excitation forces
   on a dynamically loaded flexible structure. For this purpose, a flexible
   structure is equipped with acceleration transducers at each degree of
   freedom and a force transducer for validation and training. Two types of
   models were developed; the first type uses current accelerations only
   while the second type considers both the current accelerations and the
   historical values. The models are trained using data obtained from
   applying a random excitation force on the flexible structure. The
   performance of the developed models is evaluated by analyzing the
   prediction capabilities based on a normalized prediction error. The
   frequency domain is considered to analyze the similarity of the
   frequencies in the predicted and the original force signal. For a
   selection of the best models, a more advanced performance analysis is
   carried out. This includes application of the trained models to
   deterministic and non-deterministic excitation forces with different
   excitation frequencies and amplitudes. Additionally, the influence of
   the sampling frequency and sensor location on the model performance is
   investigated. The results obtained in this paper show that ANFIS models
   can be used to set up reliable force predictors for dynamical loaded
   flexible structures, when a certain degree of inaccuracy is accepted.
   Furthermore, the comparison study points out that the transducer
   location is crucial for the model performance. However, there exists no
   general solution for the final selection of models. The findings showed
   that the model type employing historical values gives better predictions
   when operating in their trained regions while the models using only
   current values have generally higher prediction errors in trained
   regions but are less sensitive to changes of the system dynamics
   history.}},

Abstract = {{Computing microvascular cerebral blood flow (mu CBF) in real cortical
   angiograms is challenging. Here, we investigated whether the use of
   Doppler optical coherence tomography (DOCT) flow measurements in
   individual vessel segments can help in reconstructing mu CBF across the
   entire vasculature of a truncated cortical angiogram. A mu CBF
   computational framework integrating DOCT measurements is presented.
   Simulations performed on a synthetic angiogram showed that the addition
   of DOCT measurements, especially close to large inflowing or outflowing
   vessels, reduces the impact of pressure boundary conditions and
   estimated vessel resistances resulting in a more accurate reconstruction
   of mu CBF. Our technique was then applied to reconstruct microvascular
   flow distributions in the mouse cortex down to 660 mu m by combining
   two-photon laser scanning microscopy angiography with DOCT. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{SN-38 is a highly effective drug against many cancers. The development
   of an optimal delivery system for SN-38 is extremely challenging due to
   its low solubility and labile lactone ring. Herein, SN-38 encapsulated

   enhance its solubility, stability and cellular uptake. SN-38-loaded NPs
   prepared by spontaneous emulsification solvent diffusion (SESD) method
   had an average diameter of 310 nm, a zeta potential of -9.69 mV and a
   loading efficiency of 71\%. They were able to protect the active lactone
   ring of SN-38 against inactivation under physiological condition. A
   colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line (COLO-205) was used to assess the
   NPs effects on cytotoxicity and cellular uptake. Result showed a
   significant decreased cell proliferation and cell apoptosis. These

   sections cannot be applied in the aerospace industry. A conceptual
   framework with four elements, supply chain competency, governance
   policy, relationship in supply chain and aerospace industry context,
   provides a basis for assessing the opportunities and challenges of the
   green supply chain in this industry.
   Design/methodology/approach - The basic research method utilized in this
   paper is the literature review. The literature review is a research
   methodology that includes examining books, journals, conference
   proceedings and dissertations for available information on the area of
   research. The research area regarding EOL aircraft is new. A substantial
   amount of literature exists in the field of end-of-life vehicle, but the
   main content of literature about the aircraft recycling can be obtained
   via relatively few literature, technical reports, news and industrial
   experts' opinions. The literature is complete in some respects while
   inadequate in others. A considerable amount of information has been
   gathered through graduate student projects. The other information has
   been collected via contacts with professionals involved in an EOL
   aircraft recycling project. The basis for this methodological framework
   comes from a research process proposed by Mayring (2010) that emphasizes
   on four steps: material collection, descriptive analysis, category
   section and material evaluation.
   Findings - This paper addresses the opportunities and challenges of
   applying a green supply chain for aircraft manufacturers and analyzes
   the different aspects of aircraft at the EOL in the context of green
   supply chain.
   Research limitations/implications - This study enriches the literature
   by identifying EOL aircraft value chain analysis in the sustainable
   development context. It provides an introduction to a fresh research
   theme and sheds some light on green supply challenges in the aerospace
   industry.
   Practical implications - The proposed conceptual framework in this paper
   helps practitioners to realize the opportunities and challenges of
   aircraft manufacturers in applying long-term strategies with respect to
   EOL aircrafts. The proposed framework helps manufacturers to evaluate
   different perspectives of the EOL aircraft problem. Moreover, the
   current contribution of aircraft manufacturers into EOL projects is not
   in a systematic structure and performed through several managerial and
   professional meetings. The proposed framework in this study is a
   valuable tool to evaluate the different opportunities and challenges in
   an organized way.
   Originality/value - This work provides a valuable framework for future
   research related to green supply chains in the aerospace context. It
   also aids practitioners to realize the EOL aircraft problem in the
   context of the green supply chain, considering the opportunities and
   challenges.}},

Abstract = {{Rheological and mechanical properties of polypropylene (PP)/CNCs
   nanocomposites were compared with those of nanocomposites containing
   poly(ethylene-co-vinyl alcohol) as a compatibilizer. The nanocomposites
   were prepared by a Brabender internal mixer at CNC contents of 5 wt\%.
   The compression molded nanocomposite dog-bones and disks were
   characterized regarding their tensile and dynamic rheological behavior,
   respectively. The complex viscosity of the nanocomposites samples
   containing the compatibilizer were increased, slightly, compared to the
   non-compatibilized nanocomposite samples. Moreover, an overshoot in the
   transient start-up viscosity of the compatibilized nanocomposite was
   observed. The Young modulus of the nanocomposite samples containing the
   compatibilizer were increased up to ca. 37\% compared to the neat PP.
   The elongation at break was decreased in all PP/CNC nanocomposite
   samples, but less for the nanocomposite samples containing the
   compatibilizer. The crystalline content of the PP in the nanocomposites
   and also the crystallization temperature were increased after
   compatibilization. These results could be ascribed to the efficiency of
   the poly(ethylene-co-vinyl alcohol) as a compatibilizer that favors a
   better dispersion and wetting of the hydrophilic CNCs within the
   hydrophobic PP.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, the possibility to easy open a food package is of great
   interest both from the consumer and food producers' perspective. In this
   study, the peel/seal properties of poly (ethylene methyl acrylate)
   (EMA)/polybutene-1 (PB-1) blend films were investigated. Three blends of
   EMA/PB-1 with different methyl acrylate (MA) content were prepared using
   cast extrusion process. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was used
   to investigate the thermal behavior as well as the crystalinity of the
   blends. The effect of polymer matrix on the crystalline structure of
   PB-1 was studied using Wide Angle X-ray Diffraction (WAXD) and DSC.
   T-peel tests were carried out on the heat sealed films at various seal
   temperatures. The effect of MA content and heat seal temperature on
   peel/seal properties (i.e. peel initiation temperature, temperature

Abstract = {{A combined serial OCT/confocal scanner was designed to image large
   sections of biological tissues at microscopic resolution. Serial imaging
   of organs embedded in agarose blocks is performed by cutting through
   tissue using a vibratome which sequentially cuts slices in order to
   reveal new tissue to image, overcoming limited light penetration
   encountered in microscopy. Two linear stages allow moving the tissue
   with respect to the microscope objective, acquiring a 2D grid of volumes
   (1x1x0.3 mm) with OCT and a 2D grid of images (1x1mm) with the confocal
   arm. This process is repeated automatically, until the entire sample is
   imaged. Raw data is then post-processed to re-stitch each individual
   acquisition and obtain a reconstructed volume of the imaged tissue. This
   design is being used to investigate correlations between white matter
   and microvasculature changes with aging and with increase in pulse
   pressure following transaortic constriction in mice. The dual imaging
   capability of the system allowed to reveal different contrast
   information: OCT imaging reveals changes in refractive indices giving
   contrast between white and grey matter in the mouse brain, while
   transcardial perfusion of FITC or pre-sacrifice injection of Evans Blue
   shows microsvasculature properties in the brain with confocal imaging.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we investigate the dynamical properties of the Boolean
   networks (BN) that control a robot performing a composite task.
   Initially, the robot must perform phototaxis, i.e. move towards a light
   source located in the environment; upon perceiving a sharp sound, the
   robot must switch to antiphototaxis, i.e. move away from the light
   source. The network controlling the robot is subject to an adaptive walk
   and the process is subdivided in two sequential phases: in the first
   phase, the learning feedback is an evaluation of the robot's performance
   in achieving only phototaxis; in the second phase, the learning feedback
   is composed of a performance measure accounting for both phototaxis and
   antiphototaxis. In this way, it is possible to study the properties of
   the evolution of the robot when its behaviour is adapted to a new
   operational requirement. We analyse the trajectories followed by the BNs
   in the state space and find that the best performing BNs (i.e. those
   able to maintaining the previous learned behaviour while adapting to the
   new task) are characterised by generalisation capabilities and the
   emergence of simple behaviours that are dynamically combined to attain
   the global task. In addition, we also observe a further remarkable
   property: the complexity of the best performing BNs increases during
   evolution. This result may provide useful indications for improving the
   automatic design of robot controllers and it may also help shed light on
   the relation and interplay among robustness, evolvability and complexity
   in evolving systems.}},

Abstract = {{With globalization and increasing product complexity, manufacturing
   industries are experiencing increased user demands to incorporate
   informal exchange mechanisms especially when it comes to international
   groups and multifunctional products where collaboration is much more

   The article looks at industrial case studies within a global
   manufacturing company involving established communities of practices and
   Enterprise Social Media (ESM) technologies to see how these could
   possibly be combined eventually with PLM tools to improve the
   productivity of large product development teams. The results of surveys
   based on geodistant product development teams are presented. Then, a
   Social Network Analysis (SNA) tool is evaluated to represent the product
   development team dynamics and a brief overview of Social PLM
   functionalities is presented.
   The study indicates that the role of communities of practice and their
   moderators supported by ESM technologies can effectively complement the
   formal product development process commonly supported by PLM systems
   based on 3D mock- ups and other Data Management Systems.}},

Abstract = {{Instead of performing expensive experiments, it is common in industry to
   make predictions of important material properties based on some existing
   experimental results. Databases consisting of experimental observations
   are widely used in the field of Material Science Engineering. However,
   these databases are expected to be noisy since they rely on human
   measurements, and also because they are an amalgamation of various
   independent sources (research papers). Therefore, some conflicting
   information can be found between various sources. In this paper, we
   introduce a novel truth discovery approach to reduce the amount of noise
   and filter the incorrect conflicting information hidden in the
   scientific databases. Our method ranks the multiple data sources by
   considering the relationships between them, i.e., the amount of
   conflicting information and the amount of agreement, and as well
   eliminates the conflicting information. The scalable Gaussian process
   interpolation technique (SGP) is then applied to the clean dataset to
   make predictions of materials property. Comprehensive performance study
   has been done on a real life scientific database. With our new approach,
   we are able to highly improve the accuracy of SGP predictions and
   provide a more reliable database.}},

Abstract = {{Nano-hydroxyapatite (nano-HAp) materials show an analogous chemical
   composition to the biogenic mineral components of calcified tissues and
   depending on their topography they may mimic the specific arrangement of
   the crystals in bone. In this work, we have evaluated the potential of
   four synthesized nano-HAp superstructures for the in vitro conditions of
   bone-repair. Experiments are underway to investigate the effects of the
   material microstructure, surface roughness and hydrophilicity on their
   osseo-integration, osteo-conduction and osteo-induction abilities.
   Materials were tested in the presence of both, rat primary osteoblasts
   and rabbit mesenchymal stem cells. The following aspects are discussed:
   (i) cytotoxicity and material degradation; (ii) rat osteoblast
   spreading, proliferation and differentiation; and (iii) rabbit
   mesenchymal stem cell adhesion on nano-HAp and nano-HAp/collagen type I
   coatings. We effectively prepared a material based on biomimetic HAp
   nano-rods displaying the appropriate surface topography, hydrophilicity

Abstract = {{Integer programming (IP) is one of the most successful approaches for
   combinatorial optimization problems. Many IP solvers make use of the
   linear relaxation, which removes the integrality requirement on the
   variables. The relaxed problem can then be solved using linear
   programming (LP), a very efficient optimization paradigm. Constraint
   programming (CP) can solve a much wider variety of problems, since it
   does not require the problem to be expressed in terms of linear
   equations. The cost of this versatility is that in CP there is no easy
   way to automatically derive a good bound on the objective. This paper
   presents an approach based on ideas from Lagrangian decomposition (LD)
   that establishes a general bounding scheme for any CP. We provide an
   implementation for optimization problems that can be formulated with
   knapsack and regular constraints, and we give comparisons with pure CP
   approaches. Our results clearly demonstrate the benefits of our approach
   on these problems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an automatic method for the segmentation of
   vertebrae in ultrasound images. Its goal is to determine whether each
   pixel belongs to the bone surface, its acoustic shadow or other tissues.
   The method is based on the extraction of several image features
   described in the literature and which we adapted to our problem, and on
   a random forest classifier. Morphological operations and
   vertebra-specific constraints are then used in a regularisation step in
   order to obtain homogeneous regions of both the surface and the acoustic
   shadow of the vertebra. Experiments on a test database of 9 images show
   promising results, with average recognition rates for the bone surface
   and acoustic shadow of 81.87 \%, and 91.01 \%, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of visual
   deficiency and irreversible blindness for elderly individuals in Western
   countries. Its screening relies on human analysis of fundus images which
   often leads to inter-and intra-expert variability. With the aim of
   developing an automatic grading system for AMD, this paper focuses on
   identifying the best features for automatic detection of AMD in fundus
   images. First, different features based on local binary pattern (LBP),
   run-length matrix, color or gradient information are computed. Then, a
   feature selection is applied for dimensionality reduction. Finally, a
   support vector machine is trained to determine the presence or absence
   of AMD. Experiments were conducted on a dataset of 140 fundus images. A
   classification performance with an accuracy of 96 \% is achieved on
   preprocessed images of macula area using LBP features.}},

   Membrane Fuel Cell Electrode Assembly}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{The most expensive component of a fuel cell is the membrane electrode
   assembly (MEA), which consists of an ionomer membrane coated with
   catalyst material. Best-performing MEAs are currently fabricated by
   depositing and drying liquid catalyst ink on the membrane; however, this
   process is limited to individual preparation by hand due to the
   membrane's rapid water absorption that leads to shape deformation and
   coating defects. A continuous coating line can reduce the cost and time
   needed to fabricate the MEA, incentivizing the commercialization and
   widespread adoption of fuel cells. A pilot-scale membrane coating line
   was designed for such a task and is described in this paper. Accurate
   process control is necessary to prevent manufacturing defects from
   occurring in the coating line. A linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG)
   controller was developed based on a physics-based model of the coating
   process to optimally control the temperature and humidity of the drying
   zones. The process controller was implemented in the pilot-scale coating
   line proving effective in preventing defects.}},

Abstract = {{A comparative study of the mechanical performance of PP and PP/PP-g-MAH
   blends reinforced with carbon fibre (CF) obtained by two different
   moulding techniques is presented. Three filler contents were used for
   fabricating the composites: 1, 3, and 5 pph (parts per hundred). The
   crystallisation behaviour of the composites was studied by differential
   scanning calorimetry. Morphological and structural features of these
   samples were observed by atomic field microscopy and Fourier-transform
   infrared spectroscopy, respectively. Mechanical properties of the
   injection and compression moulded composites were evaluated by means of
   tensile and impact resistance tests. The fracture surface of the
   impacted samples was observed by scanning electron microscopy. The
   processing method had a noticeable effect on the results obtained in
   these tests. Young's modulus was enhanced up to 147\% when adding 5 pph
   CF to a PP matrix when processed by compression moulding. Addition of
   PP-g-MAH and CF had a favourable effect on the tensile and impact
   strength properties inmost samples; these composites showed improved
   performance as the filler content was increased.}},

Abstract = {{Building Information Modeling (BIM) has become a widely accepted tool to
   overcome the many hurdles that currently face the Architecture,
   Engineering and Construction industries. However, implementing such a
   system is always complex and the recent introduction of BIM does not
   allow organizations to build their experience on acknowledged standards
   and procedures. Moreover, data on implementation projects is still
   disseminated and fragmentary. The objective of this study is to develop
   an assistance model for BIM implementation. Solutions that are proposed
   will help develop BIM that is better integrated and better used, and
   take into account the different maturity levels of each organization.
   Indeed, based on Critical Success Factors, concrete activities that help
   in implementation are identified and can be undertaken according to the
   previous maturity evaluation of an organization. The result of this
   research consists of a structured model linking maturity, success
   factors and actions, which operates on the following principle: once an
   organization has assessed its BIM maturity, it can identify various
   weaknesses and find relevant answers in the success factors and the
   associated}},

Abstract = {{Thermoplastic foams have several advantages in comparison with unfoamed
   polymers such as lightweight, high strength to weight ratio, excellent
   insulation property high thermal stability, high impact strength and
   toughness, as well as high fatigue life. These outstanding properties
   lead cellular plastics to various industrial applications in packaging,
   automotive parts, absorbents, and sporting equipment. Nowadays,
   polypropylene (PP), because of its outstanding characteristics such as
   low material cost, high service temperature, high melting point, high
   tensile modulus, low density and excellent chemical resistance, is a
   major resin in the foaming industry. However, foaming of conventional PP
   is limited by its low melt strength leading to poor cell morphology cell
   rupture/coalescence and limited density reduction. To improve PP melt
   strength, several strategies including particle addition as nucleating
   agent, introduction of long chain branching, blending with high melt
   strength polymers and crosslinking have been proposed. In this review,
   these issues are discussed and analyzed in terms of mechanical, thermal,
   and rheological characterizations.}},

Abstract = {{High dimensional engineered features have yielded high performance
   results on a variety of visual recognition tasks and attracted
   significant recent attention. Here, we examine the problem of expression
   recognition in static facial images. We first present a technique to
   build high dimensional, similar to 60k features composed of dense Census
   transformed vectors based on locations defined by facial keypoint
   predictions. The approach yields state of the art performance at 96.8\%
   accuracy for detecting facial expressions on the well known Cohn-Kanade
   plus (CK+) evaluation and 93.2\% for smile detection on the GENKI
   dataset. We also find that the subsequent application of a linear
   discriminative dimensionality reduction technique can make the approach
   more robust when keypoint locations are less precise. We go on to
   explore the recognition of expressions captured under more challenging
   pose and illumination conditions. Specifically, we test this
   representation on the GENKI smile detection dataset. Our high
   dimensional feature technique yields state of the art performance on
   both of these well known evaluations.}},

Abstract = {{The Business-to-Business Meeting Scheduling Problem was recently
   introduced to this community. It consists of scheduling meetings between
   given pairs of participants to an event while taking into account
   participant availability and accommodation capacity. The challenging
   aspect of this problem is that breaks in a participant's schedule should
   be avoided as much as possible. In an earlier paper, starting from two
   generic CP and Pseudo-Boolean formulations, several solving approaches
   such as CP, ILP, SMT, and lazy clause generation were compared on
   real-life instances. In this paper we use this challenging problem to
   study different formulations adapted either for MIP or CP solving,
   showing that the cost regular global constraint can be quite useful,
   both in MIP and CP, in capturing the problem structure.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a detailed comparison of steady and unsteady

   with experimental velocity and pressure measurements. The computational
   flow domain includes the guide vanes, the runner and the draft tube. A
   number of turbulence models were studied, including the standard k -
   epsilon, RNG k - epsilon, SST and SST-SAS models. Prediction of the flow
   behavior in the conical section of the draft tube directly below the
   runner cone is very sensitive to the prediction of the separation point
   on the runner cone. The results demonstrate a significant increase in
   precision of the flow modeling in the runner cone region by using
   unsteady flow simulations compare to stage simulation. The prediction of
   the flow in the runner cone region, however, remains delicate, and no
   turbulence model could accurately predict the complex phenomena observed
   experimentally.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we describe an interactive evolutionary algorithm called
   Interactive WASF-GA to solve multiobjective optimization problems. This
   algorithm is based on a preference-based evolutionary multiobjective
   optimization algorithm called WASF-GA. In Interactive WASF-GA, a
   decision maker provides preference information at each iteration simply
   as a reference point consisting of desirable objective function values
   and the number of solutions to be compared. Using this information, the
   desired number of solutions is generated to represent the region of
   interest of the Pareto optimal front associated to the reference point
   given. Interactive WASF-GA implies a much lower computational cost than
   the original WASF-GA because it generates a small number of solutions.
   This speeds up the convergence of the algorithm, making it suitable for
   many decision-making problems. Its efficiency and usefulness is
   demonstrated with a five-objective optimization problem.}},

Abstract = {{The paper is about energy efficiency as a powerful tool in the fight
   against climate change. It was highlighted that energy consumption, as
   well as greenhouse gases emission GHG, continue to increase in a high
   cadence, andthis fact can mortgage the achievement of 450 ppm (parts per
   million) scenario. To bend the current tendency and meet the 450 ppm
   scenario objectives, the energy efficiency policy will play a major role
   in any effective approach, as it is expected to double the reduction in
   energy intensity, which has to pass from 1.2 \% to 2.4 \%. What can
   augur the feasibility of the approach resides in the fact that the
   required energy efficiency measures are not only viable from the
   economic point of view, but also can be quickly concretized by already
   widely felt experienced technologies.
   The North American successful example of the mandatory imposition of
   minimal energy performance standard MEPS in the field of electric motors
   showed that by imposing the most efficiency measures, public authorities
   can make the eco technologies energy dominant the market. This success
   story showed that emergent technologies can massively penetrate the
   market if public authorities effectively play the role of active
   regulator, catalyst of progress.}},

Abstract = {{Different possibilities are available to treat aircraft end-of-life
   (EOL), each with positive and negative impacts on the 3 spheres of
   sustainable development. EOL processing includes 4 major steps:
   decontamination, disassembly of reused or remanufactured parts,
   dismantling of the remaining carcass, materials recovery and
   valorization and/or landfill. In this paper, we present general methods
   to dispose of and/or implement profitable rebirthing processes and a
   dedicated infrastructure for end-of-life aircraft (real Bombardier
   CRJ100) and helicopters operated in Canada. This work is critical to
   help aircraft manufacturers design current and next generation aircraft
   and to facilitate disposal after use. The scope of this project is well
   rounded and includes all aspects related to dismantling of an aircraft;
   from legal, to scientific and engineering. These aspects are studied
   using both modeling and experimental approaches. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.}},

Pages = {{731-746}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Technological innovations in mining equipment have led to
   increased productivity and occupational health and safety (OHS)
   performance, but their introduction also brings new risks for workers.
   OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to provide support for mining
   industry managers who are required to reconcile equipment choices with
   OHS and productivity.
   METHODS: Examination of the literature through interdisciplinary digital
   databases. Databases were searched using specific combinations of
   keywords and limited to studies dating back no farther than 1992. The
   ``snowball{''} technique was also used to examining the references
   listed in research articles initially identified with the databases.
   RESULTS: A total of 19 contextual factors were identified as having the
   potential to influence the OHS and productivity leverage of equipment
   innovations. The most often cited among these factors are the level of
   training provided to the equipment operators, operator experience and
   age, supervisor leadership abilities, and maintaining good relations
   within work crews.
   CONCLUSIONS: Interactions between these factors are not discussed in
   mining innovation literature. It would be helpful to use a systems
   thinking approach which incorporates interaction between relevant actors
   and factors to define properly the most sensitive aspects of innovation
   management as it applies to mining equipment.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{33}},
Pages = {{16953-16960}},
Abstract = {{Superhydrophobic (SH) surfaces generally refer to those having a static
   water contact angle larger than 150 degrees and a slide angle less than
   10 degrees, when both the surface and the water droplet are at room
   temperature. Most such surfaces lose superhydrophobicity when exposed to
   hot (e.g., >55 degrees C) water. Our recently published results (Z. J.
   Yu, J. Y. Yang, W. Fang, Q. Ge, L.-L. Yang, Z.-L. Ding, D.-Q. Yang, E.
   Sacher and T. T. Isimjan, Journal ofMaterials Chemistry A, 2014, 2
   10639) indicated that hot water superhydrophobicity is maintained when
   the SH surface temperature is higher than that of the water droplet.
   Here, we find that carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can be developed into SH
   surface coatings that repel hot water without any limitation to the
   surface temperature. Our SEM observations demonstrate that
   nanostructures formed by CNTs, contributing both a high porosity and a
   small water droplet contact area, will maintain superhydrophobicity even
   for hot water. In particular, a composite, made of CNTs and an organic
   silicone resin binder, shows both excellent hot water repellency and
   mechanical robustness, which, together, promise potential applications
   in hot liquid self-cleaning and high efficiency heat transfer.}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate the impact of the stretching temperature on the morphology
   of cellular polypropylene (PP) films, a series of PP films filled with
   spherical particles of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and platy talc
   particles with weight concentrations varying from 15 to 35 wt\% were
   prepared by twin-screw extrusion then biaxially stretched at three
   temperatures (152, 155 and 158 degrees C). Their corresponding cellular
   morphology was analyzed from scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
   micrographs. It was shown that film stretching at the lower temperature
   (152 degrees C) led to delamination of PP/CaCO3 or PP/talc interface,
   while it was not the case when these films were stretched at 158 degrees
   C. It was also observed that, when films were stretched at 152 degrees
   C, their corresponding developed cells had an average cell wall
   thickness t of around 3.6 mu m, an average cell height b of around 13.6
   mu m, and an average cell aspect ratio a/b of around 5.6, where a (mu m)
   is the average cell width. These values were within the aimed cell

Title = {{Development of a leagile transformation methodology for product
   development}},
Journal = {{BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{791-819}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a leagile
   transformation model for product development that guides manufacturers
   in the construction of a road map and the management of its deployment
   in line with both lean and agile improvement objectives.
   Design/methodology/approach - An intervention qualitative and
   transformative research approach was adopted in order to develop
   required knowledge to theorise professional practice made from rigorous
   observations of facts. The research project took place over a period of
   two and a half years, in partnership with an international firm that
   develops and produces a wide range of luxury products.
   Findings - The application of the methodology proved that a lean
   transformation does not have to be generated only by the field needs but
   it can follow a mixed approach where a top-down transformation
   management linked with strategic objectives is deployed without
   compromising implication and needs from people on the field. The right
   balance can be found between the strategic aspect of transformation and
   the incremental aspect on the field of lean paradigms.
   Research limitations/implications - For complete validation and
   widespread scientific application, the model should be tested in other
   sectors and industries.
   Practical implications - The application case of the leagile model in
   several divisions of a luxury organisation proved that the proposed
   approach can be used as a guide for manufacturer in the construction of
   an improvement road map and in the management of its deployment. The
   application cases enabled a number of positive results to be generated
   and measured on quantitative indicators such as service ratio for new
   products for which, one of the divisions saw an increase of 30 per cent.
   The approach created a positive revolution among development team
   members by its potential in terms of communication, steering,
   benchmarking and knowledge system.
   Originality/value - The model supports the identification and
   prioritisation of improvement initiatives by focusing on the levers for
   improvement that meet the needs and objectives of transformation, as
   well as the organisation's maturity level.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Chitosan (CS) end-group chemistry is a conjugation strategy that has
   been minimally exploited in the literature to date. Although the
   open-chain form of the CS reducing extremity bears a reactive aldehyde
   moiety, the most common method to generate a reactive end-group on CS is
   nitrous acid depolymerization, which produces a 2,5-anhydro-D-mannose
   unit (M-Unit) bearing also an aldehyde moiety. However, the availability
   of the latter might be low, since previous literature suggests that its
   hydrated and non-reactive form, namely the gem-diol form, is predominant
   in acidic aqueous conditions. Oxime-click chemistry has been used to
   react on such aldehydes with various degrees of success, but the use of
   a co-solvent and additional chemical reagents remain necessary to obtain
   the desired and stable covalent linkage. In this study, we have assessed
   the availability of the aldehyde reactive form on chitosan treated with
   nitrous acid. We have also assessed its reactivity towards thiol-bearing
   molecules in acidic conditions where CS amino groups are fully
   protonated and thus unreactive towards aldehyde. LC-MS and NMR
   spectroscopy methods (H-1 and DOSY, respectively) confirmed the
   regioselective thioacetylation of the reactive aldehyde with conversion
   rates between 55 and 70\% depending on the thiol molecule engaged. The
   stabilization of the hemithioacetal intermediates into the corresponding
   thioacetals was also found to be facilitated upon freeze-drying of the
   reaction medium. The PEGylation of the CS M-Unit aldehyde by
   thioacetylation was also performed as a direct application of the
   proposed conjugation approach. CS-b-PEG(2) block copolymers were
   successfully synthesized and were used to prepare block ionomer
   complexes with plasmid DNA, as revealed by their spherical morphology
   vs. the rod-like/globular/toroidal morphology observed for polyplexes
   prepared using native unmodified chitosan. This novel aqueous
   thiol-based conjugation strategy constitutes an alternative to the
   oxime-click pathway; it could be applicable to other polymers.}},

Abstract = {{At Waterloo, we are developing a high power, short pulse, two-color,
   Yb:fiber amplifier system to generate the long wavelength (> 15 mu m)
   side of the molecular fingerprint spectral region, by difference
   frequency mixing the two colors. This spectral region is important for
   trace gas detection of explosives. As an example, it has been shown that
   the strong spectroscopic signatures of a peroxide-based explosive
   triacetone triperoxide (TATP) occur between 15 and 20 mu m. To date, we
   have achieved a tuning range from 16 to 20 mu m with a maximum average
   power of 1.7 mW. On the short wavelength side, the two colors would need
   to be pulled further apart, which requires a higher power seed to beat
   the amplified spontaneous emission that appears at the gain peak of the
   amplifiers between the two seed colors. On the long wavelength side, we
   are limited to 20 mu m by the transparency region of the nonlinear
   crystals. We would like to find new nonlinear materials that have
   transparency from 1 to 30 mu m. If we could generate wavelengths from 15
   to 30 mu m with sufficient power, we could extend the spectral region to
   also cover 8 to 15 mu m by frequency doubling the longer wavelengths. We
   are currently working on replacing bulk optics in the system with fiber
   based optical elements to select the wavelengths as well as stretch and
   recompress the pulses in order to make the system compact and stable. or

Abstract = {{Plasmonic nanoparticles can lead to extreme confinement of the light in
   the near field. This unique ability of plasmonic nanoparticles can be
   used to generate nanobubbles in liquid. In this work, we demonstrate
   with single-particle monitoring that 100 nm gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)
   irradiated by off-resonance femtosecond (fs) laser in the tissue
   therapeutic optical window (lambda = 800 nm), can act as a durable
   nanolenses in liquid and provoke nanocavitation while remaining intact.
   We have employed combined ultrafast shadowgraphic imaging, in situ dark
   field imaging and dynamic tracking of AuNP Brownian motion to ensure the
   study of individual AuNPs/nanolenses under multiple fs laser pulses. We
   demonstrate that 100 nm AuNPs can generate multiple, highly confined
   (radius down to 550 nm) and transient (life time < 50 ns) nanobubbles.
   The latter is of significant importance for future development of in
   vivo AuNP-assisted laser nanosurgery and theranostic applications, where
   AuNP fragmentation should be avoided to prevent side effects, such as
   cytotoxicity and immune system's response. The experimental results have
   been correlated with theoretical modeling to provide an insight to the
   AuNP-safe cavitation mechanism as well as to investigate the deformation
   mechanism of the AuNPs at high laser fluences.}},

Abstract = {{With the increasing use of composites in civil aviation, thermoplastic
   composites have become an interesting material choice for repeating part
   numbers such as fuselage brackets. The simple L-shaped bracket geometry
   can be mass-produced using stamp-forming manufacturing. When subjected
   to opening loads, out-of-plane stresses, i.e., interlaminar tensile
   stresses, develop in the 90 degrees corner radius. Those gradually
   increasing stresses ultimately lead to delamination failure. One
   approach to evaluate the interlaminar tensile strength is to test a
   curved beam using a four-point bending apparatus to create an opening
   load. This test is described in the ASTM D6415 standard. The geometry of
   the bend (inside/outside radii), the materials and the lay-up sequence
   have a strong influence on the mechanical performance of the L-shaped
   bracket. Analytical equations were developed to evaluate the radial
   interlaminar tensile stresses in the bend. However, these equations can
   be erroneous for non-unidirectional stacking sequences. Moreover,
   geometric non-linearity can occur when flexible coupons are subjected to
   large deformation. In those cases, modeling can be used to evaluate the
   interlaminar tensile strength between layers at a given applied load. In
   this study, a finite element model of the ASTM D6415 test was created to
   calculate the out-of-plane stresses in the radius. The use of parametric
   modeling enables the simulation of various coupon configurations. The
   model is compared to the analytical equations and carbon
   fiber/polyphenylene sulphide composites L-shaped brackets of different
   stacking sequences, thicknesses and bend radii.}},

Abstract = {{Electrically conductive composites (ECCs) have recently shown a very
   high potential to replace metals for several applications such as
   electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, sensors, antistatic
   coatings, and flexible electrodes. The ECCs are mainly composed of a
   conductive filler dispersed in a polymer matrix. In this work we
   demonstrate the fabrication of a nanocomposite by dispersing carbon
   nanotubes (CNTs) in polylactic acid (PLA) by using the ball mill mixing
   method. Nanocomposites with various concentrations of CNTs in PLA were
   fabricated and their electrical conductivities were measured. The ball
   mill mixing method enabled us to make CNT/PLA with a very high
   concentration of CNTs (up to 40 wt.\%). The PLA/CNTs were extruded from
   a micronozzle to fabricate nanocomposite filaments with a diameter as
   small as similar to 70 mu m and a high electrical conductivity reaching
   up to similar to 4000 S/m. Conductive porous structures (CPSs) were
   fabricated by hot pressing the conductive filaments. The application of
   these CPSs is shown here as a liquid sensor since their electrical
   resistivity changes when they get in contact with acetone. These CPSs
   are promising candidates for liquid sensor and EMI shielding
   applications due to their lightweight, mechanical flexibility and
   electrical conductivity.}},

Abstract = {{A combined sewer overflow (CSO) outfall was monitored to assess the
   impact of temporal mass loads on the appropriateness of treatment
   options. Instantaneous loads (mass per s) varied by approximately three
   orders of magnitude during events (n = 9 in spring, summer and the fall)
   with no significant seasonal variations. The median fraction of total
   loads discharged with the first 25\% of the total volume ranged from
   28\% (theophylline) to 40\% (Total Suspended Solids (TSS)) and loads
   remained high for the duration of the events. E. coli and TSS loads
   originated primarily from wastewater (WW) (63\% and 75\%, respectively).
   However, a mix of stormwater (SW) and sewer deposit (SD) resuspension
   contributed from 73 to 95\% for the first 50\% of the volume discharged
   of total TSS loads for 2 events. The contribution of SD resuspension was
   not negligible for Wastewater Micropollutants (WWMPs), especially for
   carbamazepine. Sustained high loads over the course of CSOs highlight
   the need to revisit current CSO and SW management strategies that focus

Abstract = {{Bench-scale experiments were conducted to evaluate disinfection
   by-product (DBP) precursor removal by coagulation with alum and ferric
   sulfate (FS), intermediate ozonation (IO3), powdered-activated carbon
   (PAC), ion exchange resin (IX), and spiral-wound nanofiltration (NF).
   The effect of source water quality on process performance was also
   assessed on six source waters. Overall, NF offered the best performance
   in terms of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removals along with lower DBP
   concentrations in every tested condition except for DOC-rich waters
   (13-15 mg/L). Conventional treatment coupled with recirculated PAC
   adsorption (Actiflo (R) Carb) was the process configuration providing
   the most consistently low DOC (less than 2 mg/L), facilitating DBP
   regulation compliance. IX/alum and alum/IO3 reduced DBP concentration to
   a lesser extent, but proved to be more efficient than conventional
   treatment with alum alone. In terms of effluent DBP concentration, FS
   outperformed alum at higher coagulant dosages, whereas alum offered a
   superior performance at lower dosages. Finally, this investigation shows
   the relevance of conducting treatability assays to identify the most
   suitable treatment alternative for DBP control.}},

Abstract = {{Polyacrylamide polymers (PAM) are one of the most common water treatment
   chemicals used in clarification processes. Concerns have been raised
   with regards to the aquatic and human toxicity of acrylamide monomer.
   Greener polymers, produced using potato starch, were investigated at
   lab-scale as a potential non-toxic alternative to the use of PAM within
   a ballasted flocculation process (Actiflo (R)). Even under extreme
   temperature (1 degrees C), starch and PAM showed comparable turbidity
   removal performances, although higher starch dosages (four to five
   times) were needed to achieve such results. Compared to PAM, activated
   starch polymers also benefited from the use of lower mixing energy and
   smaller microsand. A slight biodegradable dissolved organic carbon
   (BDOC) release (approximate to 0.15 mg C/L) was also measured while
   using starch polymer, but this did not impact trihalomethane and
   haloacetic acid formation. These results indicate that activated starch
   polymers represent a promising alternative to the use of PAM polymers in
   a ballasted flocculation process.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the characterization of nanocrystalline powders of
   ytterbium doped YLiF4 for applications in optical refrigeration. Here we
   used powders with nanocrystals of Yb3+ concentrations of (10, 15, 20)
   mol \% and lengths (70, 66, 96) nm. Our preliminary spectroscopic
   measurements did not show an enhancement in the absorption at the
   long-wavelength tail of the spectra of the nanocrystalline powder when
   compared with bulk Yb:YLiF4, indicating that the increase of the
   phonon-assisted excitation is not large enough to play a significant
   role in cooling in the present conditions. One advantage of
   nanocrystalline powders over bulk crystals is the possibility of
   enhancing the absorption by the realization of cavity-less pump
   recycling through photon localization {[}1]. While photon localization
   also increases the reabsorption of the fluorescence depending on the
   quantum efficiency of the material and can mitigate cooling, it allows
   the use of crystals of low enough concentrations to avoid deleterious
   effects such as ion-ion energy transfer followed by quenching. The pump
   intensity enhancement favors upconversion luminescence to visible
   wavelengths, which can be used for optical refrigeration and extends the
   scope of the application for the material. We observed both green and
   blue emission from the samples and investigate the processes which lead
   to it. We present the experimental investigation of the nanocrystals'
   absorption and emission spectra and the first excited state lifetime
   measurements, which are used to estimate the nanocrystal's
   photoluminescence quantum efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the characterization of oxyfluoride glasses and glass
   ceramics for their application in optical refrigeration. Oxide glasses
   are chemically and mechanically stable and relatively ease to handle and
   fabricate, but their high maximum phonon energy leads to a nonradiative
   decay rate which is unacceptable for optical refrigeration. On the other
   hand, low-maximum phonon energy hosts such as fluorides lack the
   desirable mechanical and chemical stabilities to make them widely used.
   The combination of the high chemical and mechanical stability of oxides
   and the low maximum phonon energy of fluorides make oxyfluorides strong
   potential candidates for wide-spread use in optical refrigeration.
   Glasses and ultra-transparent glass-ceramics of molar composition
   30SiO(2)-15Al(2)O(3)-(27-x)CdF2-22PbF(2)-4YF(3)-xYbF(3), with x = (2, 5,

   photoluminescence spectra, as well as the lifetime and the external
   quantum efficiency of the photoluminescence for these samples using an
   integrating sphere are reported. The effects of reabsorption on the
   measured mean fluorescence wavelength are also reported. The cooling
   efficiencies of the samples were measured as a function of the pump
   wavelength using a calorimetric method with a Ti: Sapphire laser pump
   source and a fiber Bragg grating sensor for a direct temperature
   measurement. Impurities and background absorption are also investigated
   using different pump sources and the calorimetric method. From a
   comparison of the cooling/heating performance of the oxyfluoride glasses
   and glass-ceramics containing various Yb3+ amounts, we developed a
   strategy to realize and enhance optical refrigeration in this class of
   material.}},

Abstract = {{Glass-ceramics are composite materials consisting of crystals which are
   controllably grown within a glass matrix usually by applying an
   appropriate heat treatment. They possess outstanding optical properties
   with applications in solid state lasers, optical amplifiers, and now,
   laser induced cooling. For laser cooling, the material should exhibit
   specific properties like low phonon energy environment around the
   lanthanide ions, low background losses, high transparency and high
   photoluminescence quantum yield. In the present study, oxyfluoride
   glasses and ultra-transparent nano glass-ceramics doped with different
   concentrations (2, 5, 8, 12, 16 and 20 mol \%) of Yb3+ ions have been
   prepared by conventional melt-quenching and subsequent thermal
   treatments at different temperatures, respectively. Differential
   scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements have
   been performed to characterize the thermal properties of the glass and
   the structural changes in the glass-ceramics, respectively. The XRD
   patterns confirm the growth of beta-PbF2 nanocrystals as well as
   progressive incorporation of Yb3+ ions. This enhances the Yb3+ ion
   emission intensity which depends on the doping concentration and
   ceramization temperatures. The size (20 nm) of the nanocrystallites was
   estimated from the Sherrer's formula and found to increase with
   increasing ceramization temperature, small enough to avoid scattering
   losses and ensure an excellent transparency of the glass-ceramics
   comparable with that of the parent glass. An enhancement of the
   luminescence properties of Yb3+ ions surrounded by a crystalline low
   phonon environment is observed. Finally, the utilization of these
   heavily Yb3+-doped ultra-transparent materials for laser cooling and
   solid state laser applications is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Despite recent findings on the possible role of age-related cerebral
   microvasculature changes in cognition decline, previous studies of
   capillary blood flow in aging (using animal models) are scarce and
   limited to anesthetized conditions. Since anesthesia can have different
   effects in young and old animals, it may introduce a confounding effect
   in aging studies. The present study aimed to eliminate the potential
   confound introduced by anesthesia by measuring capillary blood flow
   parameters in both awake conditions and under isoflurane anesthesia. We
   used 2-photon laser scanning fluorescence microscopy to measure
   capillary diameter, red blood cell velocity and flux, hematocrit and
   capillary volumetric flow in individual capillaries in the barrel cortex
   of 6- and 24-month old C57Bl/6 mice. It was observed that microvascular
   properties are significantly affected by anesthesia leading to different
   trends in capillary blood flow parameters with aging when measured under
   awake or anesthetized conditions. The findings in this study suggest
   taking extra care in interpreting aging studies from anesthetized
   animals.}},

   protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) fluorescence guided resection can improve
   surgical outcomes by better defining tumor margins and identifying
   satellite tumor foci. However, visual assessment of PpIX fluorescence is
   subjective and limited by the distorting effects of light attenuation
   (absorption and scattering) by tissue and background tissue
   autofluorescence. We have previously shown, using a point
   fluorescence-reflectance fiberoptic probe, that non-invasive measurement
   of the absolute PpIX concentration, {[}PpIX], further improves
   sensitivity and specificity, leading to the demonstration that the
   technique can also detect low-grade gliomas as well as otherwise
   undetectable residual tumor foci in high-grade disease. Here, we extend
   this approach to wide-field quantitative fluorescence imaging (qFI) by
   implementing spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) to recover the
   tissue optical absorption and transport scattering coefficients across
   the field of view. We report on the performance of this approach to
   determine the intrinsic fluorescence intensity in tissue-simulating
   phantoms in both the fully diffusive (i.e. scatter-dominated) and
   sub-diffusive (low transport albedo) regimes, for which higher spatial
   frequencies are used. The performance of qFI is compared to a
   Born-normalization correction scheme, as well as to the values obtained
   using the fiberoptic probe on homogeneous tissue phantoms containing
   PpIX.}},

Abstract = {{Design and synthesis of branched tetraethylene glycol (TEG) based
   ligands for subsequent conjugation to gold nanoshells are reported. TEG
   enhances the aqueous solubility of hollow gold nanoshells (HAuNShs), and
   the branched architecture provides stability. An examination of the
   supernatant of the surface displacement reaction shows that the
   structure of the ligand plays an important role in the functionalization
   of HAuNShs. The binding of multivalent ligands leads to rupturing of the
   gold nanoshell architecture; most probably due to the large dendron not
   compensating the replacement of small citrate capping agents. The
   construction of a probe with dual imaging capabilities is demonstrated
   by covalent linking of a dendron containing Cy5.5(A) dye to gold
   nanoshells. It leads to fluorescence quenching of Cy5.5(A) by the gold
   nanoshells, as evidenced in solution and in cellular internalization
   studies with J774 and bEnd.3 cells.}},

Abstract = {{In this letter, a low-profile triple-band triple-polarization antenna is

   sizes. The two triangular rings each works as a dual-frequency
   dual-polarization radiator. The polarization states at the three bands
   are horizontal polarization, 45 polarization, and vertical polarization,
   which are achieved by the horizontal mode of the larger TRG, the
   superposition of the vertical mode of the larger TRG and horizontal mode
   of the smaller TRG, and the vertical mode of the smaller TRG,
   respectively. The overall size of the proposed antenna on the substrate
   with a low dielectric constant of 2.2 is 0.28 lambda(0) x 0.28 lambda(0)

Title = {{Pose Estimation with a Kinect for Ergonomic Studies: Evaluation of the
   Accuracy Using a Virtual Mannequin}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Analyzing human poses with a Kinect is a promising method to evaluate
   potentials risks of musculoskeletal disorders at workstations. In
   ecological situations, complex 3D poses and constraints imposed by the
   environment make it difficult to obtain reliable kinematic information.
   Thus, being able to predict the potential accuracy of the measurement
   for such complex 3D poses and sensor placements is challenging in
   classical experimental setups. To tackle this problem, we propose a new
   evaluation method based on a virtual mannequin. In this study, we apply
   this method to the evaluation of joint positions (shoulder, elbow, and
   wrist), joint angles (shoulder and elbow), and the corresponding RULA (a
   popular ergonomics assessment grid) upper-limb score for a large set of
   poses and sensor placements. Thanks to this evaluation method, more than
   500,000 configurations have been automatically tested, which would be
   almost impossible to evaluate with classical protocols. The results show
   that the kinematic information obtained by the Kinect software is
   generally accurate enough to fill in ergonomic assessment grids. However
   inaccuracy strongly increases for some specific poses and sensor
   positions. Using this evaluation method enabled us to report
   configurations that could lead to these high inaccuracies. As a
   supplementary material, we provide a software tool to help designers to
   evaluate the expected accuracy of this sensor for a set of upper-limb
   configurations. Results obtained with the virtual mannequin are in
   accordance with those obtained from a real subject for a limited set of
   poses and sensor placements.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we present a comparative study of several strategies
   that can be applied to achieve the so-called elementary lower bound in
   vehicle routing problems, that is, the bound obtained when all
   positive-valued variables in an optimal solution of the linear
   relaxation of the set-partitioning formulation correspond to vehicle
   routes without cycles. This bound can be achieved by solving the
   resource-constrained elementary shortest path probleman
   N P
   -hard problemas the pricing problem in a column generation algorithm,
   but several other strategies can be used to ultimately produce the same
   lower bound in less computational effort. State-of-the-art algorithms
   for vehicle routing problems rely on the quality of this lower bound to
   either bound the size of the search tree in a branch-and-price algorithm
   or the complexity of an enumeration procedure used to limit the number
   of variables in the set-partitioning model. We consider several
   strategies for imposing elementarity that involve ng-paths, strong
   degree constraints, and decremental state-space relaxation. We compare
   the performance of these strategies on some selected instances of the

Abstract = {{The nanostructure and the oxygen storage capacity against reactive
   oxygen species (ROS) are essential features to take into account during
   the design of a new material that will be used as the basis of novel
   therapeutic technologies. Here we evaluate the incorporation of
   nano-ceria, which has a demonstrated ability to scavenge free radicals
   under physiological conditions comparable to those observed for
   superoxide dismutase and catalase, to TiO2 crystalline assemblies. The
   material was planned to merge the scavenging properties of CeO2 on a
   specifically designed structured TiO2 substrate. The presence of Ce
   atoms has a clear influence on the materials' morphologies, distorting
   the anatase crystal lattice and inducing the formation of fullerene-like
   structures. The cytotoxicity of the materials against L929 fibroblasts
   after 24 hours of cell culture was evaluated. Both structural and
   oxidative properties of the materials have a clear effect on fibroblast
   viability; in fact it was demonstrated that cellular proliferation can
   be modulated by varying the Ce3+/Ti4+ molar ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Realizing laterally continuous ultra-thin gold films on transparent
   substrates is a challenge of significant technological importance. In
   the present work, formation of ultra-thin gold films on fused silica is
   studied, demonstrating how suppression of island formation and reduction
   of plasmonic absorption can be achieved by treating substrates with
   (3-mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane prior to deposition. Void-free films
   with deposition thickness as low as 5.4 nm are realized and remain
   structurally stable at room temperature. Based on detailed structural
   analysis of the films by specular and diffuse X-ray reflectivity
   measurements, it is shown that optical transmission properties of
   continuous ultra-thin films can be accounted for using the bulk
   dielectric function of gold. However, it is important to take into
   account the non-abrupt transition zone between the metal and the
   surrounding dielectrics, which extends through several lattice constants
   for the laterally continuous ultra-thin films (film thickness below 10
   nm). This results in a significant reduction of optical transmission, as
   compared to the case of abrupt interfaces. These findings imply that the
   atomic-scale interface structure plays an important role when continuous
   ultra-thin films are considered, e.g., as semi-transparent electrical
   contacts, since optical transmission deviates significantly from the
   theoretical predictions for ideal films.}},

Abstract = {{An Enhanced Intervening Opportunities Model (EIOM) is developed for
   Public Transit (PT). This is a distribution supply dependent model, with
   single constraints on trip production for work trips during morning peak
   hours (6:00 a.m.-9:00 a.m.) within the Island of Montreal, Canada.
   Different data sets, including the 2008 Origin-Destination (OD) survey
   of the Greater Montreal Area, the 2006 Census of Canada, GTFS network
   data, along with the geographical data of the study area, are used. EIOM
   is a nonlinear model composed of socio-demographics, PT supply data and
   work location attributes. An enhanced destination ranking procedure is
   used to calculate the number of spatially cumulative opportunities, the
   basic variable of EIOM. For comparison, a Basic Intervening
   Opportunities Model (BIOM) is developed by using the basic destination
   ranking procedure. The main difference between EIOM and BIOM is in the
   destination ranking procedure: EIOM considers the maximization of a
   utility function composed of PT Level Of Service and number of
   opportunities at the destination, along with the OD trip duration,
   whereas BIOM is based on a destination ranking derived only from OD trip
   durations. Analysis confirmed that EIOM is more accurate than BIOM. This
   study presents a new tool for PT analysts, planners and policy makers to
   study the potential changes in PT trip patterns due to changes in
   socio-demographic characteristics, PT supply, and other factors. Also it
   opens new opportunities for the development of more accurate PT demand
   models with new emergent data such as smart card validations.}},

Abstract = {{To model and forecast daily river flows, filtered Poisson processes with
   a response function that generalizes the one commonly used in hydrology
   are considered. The form of the response function is based on the
   concept of the instantaneous unit hydrograph and improves the quality of
   the classical model. A statistical procedure based on the theoretical
   autocorrelation coefficients is used to estimate the model parameters.
   Then, the quality of the model is assessed by comparing the theoretical
   autocorrelation coefficients obtained with both the generalized and the
   classical models to the corresponding empirical coefficients.
   Furthermore, an estimator of the flow at time t + 1, given the flows at
   time t - 1 and t, is developed in a particular case and the forecasting
   power of the model is checked, using some indicators of difference,
   compared to the classical model and to an autoregressive model. An
   application to the Delaware and the Hudson Rivers, located in the United
   States, is presented. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Time-based combinatorial auction for timber allocation and delivery
   coordination}},
Journal = {{FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{143-152}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The timber auction system currently used in the province of Quebec,
   Canada, is a single unit auction, in which timber users bid on the
   entire forest stands located within a specific area. In this procurement
   system, timber users (i.e., winners) are responsible for harvesting the
   entire stands and for reselling undesirable timber species to others. In
   order to improve the limits of this system, this paper proposes a
   sustainable auction system, referred to as time-based timber
   combinatorial auction. In this approach, time is not part of the
   definition of the goods for sale. It is used to valuate the good for
   sale with respect to their expected delivery period. Therefore, this
   system aims to simultaneously allocate multiple goods, or products in
   mixed forest stand, to multiple winners, and address the coordination of
   timber deliveries to their winners. The proposed timber combinatorial
   auction provides an open access allocation of timber, based on its
   intrinsic economic value, while allowing the Ministry of natural
   resources to exercise high standard for environmentally friendly forest
   operations. From a logistic point of view, a sensitive analysis is
   conducted in order to compare the proposed time-based combinatorial
   auction with a combinatorial auction with no delivery coordination. Both
   models are compared according to bidders' and seller's time flexibility.
   Experimental results illustrate the impact (i.e., cost) of delivery
   coordination on total revenue due to loss of value when time preference
   is not fully satisfied. This cost evaluation can then be used as an
   upper bound of the cost of coordination, when delivery coordination must
   be manually negotiated among multi-stakeholders. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Human aging is accompanied by both vascular and cognitive changes.
   Although arteries throughout the body are known to become stiffer with
   age, this vessel hardening is believed to start at the level of the
   aorta and progress to other organs, including the brain. Progression of
   this vascular impairment may contribute to cognitive changes that arise
   with a similar time course during aging. Conversely, it has been
   proposed that regular exercise plays a protective role, attenuating the
   impact of age on vascular and metabolic physiology. Here, the impact of
   vascular degradation in the absence of disease was investigated within 2
   groups of healthy younger and older adults. Age-related changes in
   executive function, elasticity of the aortic arch, cardiorespiratory
   fitness, and cerebrovascular reactivity were quantified, as well as the
   association between these parameters within the older group. In the
   cohort studied, older adults exhibited a decline in executive functions,
   measured as a slower performance in a modified Stroop task (1247.90 +/-
   204.50 vs. 898.20 +/- 211.10 ms on the inhibition and/or switching
   component, respectively) than younger adults. Older participants also
   showed higher aortic pulse wave velocity (8.98 +/- 3.56 vs. 3.95 +/-
   0.82 m/s, respectively) and lower VO2 max (29.04 +/- 6.92 vs. 42.32 +/-
   7.31 mL O-2/kg/min, respectively) than younger adults. Within the older
   group, faster performance of the modified Stroop task was associated
   with preserved aortic elasticity (lower aortic pulse wave velocity; p =
   0.046) and higher cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2 max; p = 0.036).
   Furthermore, VO2 max was found to be negatively associated with blood
   oxygenation level dependent cerebrovascular reactivity to CO2 in frontal
   regions involved in the task (p = 0.038) but positively associated with
   cerebrovascular reactivity in periventricular watershed regions and
   within the postcentral gyrus. Overall, the results of this study support
   the hypothesis that cognitive status in aging is linked to vascular
   health, and that preservation of vessel elasticity may be one of the key
   mechanisms by which physical exercise helps to alleviate cognitive
   aging. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper concerns a novel configurable analog buffer dedicated to a
   wafer-scale prototyping platform of electronic systems. The proposed
   architecture uses complementary nMOS and pMOS stage buffers, which are
   built with modified conventional differential pairs used for maximizing
   the output voltage swing. This compact analog buffer offers several
   slew-rate features that range from 66 up to 495 V/A mu s with a
   quasi-unity gain and only uses 21 transistors for a total silicon area
   of 0.001824 mm(2). The bandwidth of this proposed buffer can be
   programmed from 74 up to 194 MHz with response time up to 5.3 ns. This
   overall configurability allows better power management, reduces the
   power-supply noise injection within the wafer-scale platform, and
   diminishes the quiescent current.}},

Abstract = {{The gain bandwidth constraint of sequential-rotation arrays (SRAs) has
   been an open issue since it was first pointed out in 1989. This paper
   reveals the reason, provides some useful conclusions and proposes an
   optimum design. Firstly, a first-order analytical formula is derived for
   the array factor (AF) of the 4-element sub-SRA. The formula embraces the
   polarization properties of the antenna elements. The AF is found to be
   dependent on the elements' polarization properties and frequency, which
   is not found in conventional regular arrays. Based on the theoretical
   results and full-wave simulations, these dependencies are analyzed in
   detail. Secondly, an optimum design is proposed to enhance the gain
   bandwidth: to constitute SRA with elliptically polarized elements (this
   type of SRA is denoted as EP-SRA) rather than the conventional
   circularly polarized elements (this type of SRA is denoted as CP-SRA).
   Detailed design guidance is presented for this new method. Finally, as
   an example, a CP-SRA and an EP-SRA are designed and tested for
   comparison. According to the example, by employing EP-SRA, the 1 dB AF
   bandwidth is improved by 80\%, the measured 1 dB/3 dB gain bandwidth is
   enhanced by 114\%/76\%. In fact, the conventional CP-SRA and LP-SRA (SRA
   with linearly polarized elements) are two special cases of the proposed
   EP-SRA.}},

Abstract = {{In this communication, dual-fed wideband circularly polarized (CP) patch
   antennas based on the single-layer printed circuit board (PCB) process
   and the substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) technology are proposed.
   Firstly, a patch antenna fed by an SIW coupler is developed to achieve a
   measured 3 dB axial-ratio (AR) bandwidth of 21\% (from 38 GHz to 47
   GHz). Then, by introducing second-order inductive windows, an improved
   CP patch antenna is developed. The measured results show that the 1 dB
   gain bandwidth is expanded from 3 GHz to 9 GHz while the overlapped
   bandwidth of AR and reflect coefficient is maintained. Finally, a 2 x 2
   CP array is developed with a dual-polarized patch array. By carefully
   selecting the resonant frequency of the patches, a wide gain bandwidth
   is achieved. Moreover, by compensating the major error that deteriorates
   the AR bandwidth with a specially-designed coupler, the measured 3 dB AR
   bandwidth reaches as wide as 22.8\%. The measured peak gain is 12.35

Abstract = {{A class of directional couplers based on the substrate integrated
   waveguide (SIW) technique for compact three-dimensional (3-D) integrated
   circuits is proposed and studied in this work. Backward and forward
   couplers as well as strong coupling-defined forward couplers are
   presented and developed. They are composed of two joined SIW sections
   such that the common wall between them is made of a portion of the broad
   side of the first SIW and the narrow side of the second SIW. This
   perpendicular topology is arranged and formed through the use of a
   LEGO-like interconnect between the two SIW structures. Different
   coupling geometries developed with a low-cost printed circuit board
   process are studied. Design considerations and measured results at
   Ka-band are presented and discussed. To achieve respectively weak
   backward and forward directional couplings, Schwinger and multihole-type
   directional couplers are introduced first of all, which make use of
   coupling slots arranged around the center of the SIW broad wall. For
   each of those structures, a wideband 20-dB directional coupler is
   fabricated and measured for demonstration purposes. To achieve a strong
   coupling, a Riblet-type directional coupler is proposed and examined.
   Subsequently, a 3-dB coupler is demonstrated together with a 0-dB
   coupler, offering a wideband and very efficient transition between the
   perpendicularly arranged SIWs. The proposed directional couplers can be
   used at millimeter-wave frequencies for probing and the design of
   compact 3-D integrated circuits and systems such as polarimetric imaging
   radiometer or antenna array feeding networks.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, coextruded multilayer films with aliphatic (polyamide 6)
   and aromatic (poly (m-xylene adipamide)) nylons as well as their in-situ
   polymerized nanocomposites with 4wt\% nanoclay, as an oxygen barrier
   layer (core), and a linear low-density polyethylene, as a moisture
   barrier layer (skin), were produced and characterized. Five-layer films
   were prepared by cast coextrusion and rapidly cooled using an air knife.
   Dynamic rheological measurements showed that the selected materials can
   be coextruded with a minimum interfacial instability between the melt
   flows in the feed block. Type of crystals, crystallinity and thermal
   transitions of layers were investigated using differential scanning
   calorimetry and modulated differential scanning calorimetry. The
   mechanical, optical, oxygen and water vapor barrier properties of the
   coextruded multilayer films were measured and discussed. Although the
   crystallinity of the poly (m-xylene adipamide) layer in the multilayer
   films was lower compared to the polyamide 6 layer, the impermeability to
   oxygen and water vapor was much better for the former multilayer films.
   In addition, substituting the neat polyamide 6 and poly (m-xylene
   adipamide) by their nanocomposites improved the oxygen barrier of the
   multilayer films by more than 50\%. The series resistance model was not
   able to predict the barrier properties of the multilayer films due to
   the difference in polymer behavior for the single layer and multilayer,
   and boundary adjacent layer effects. The coextruded polyamide linear
   low-density polyethylene multilayer films showed higher toughness, tear
   and flex crack resistance compared to the poly (m-xylene
   adipamide)/linear low-density polyethylene samples. The pristine poly
   (m-xylene adipamide)-based multilayer film showed a lower haze compared
   to the polyamide 6 films due to very little crystallinity in the former.}},

Abstract = {{In the past decade, several methods have emerged to quantify water
   scarcity, water availability and the human health impacts of water use.
   It was recommended that a quantitative comparison of methods should be
   performed to describe similar impact pathways, namely water scarcity and
   human health impacts from water deprivation. This is precisely the goal
   of this paper, which aims to (1) identify the key relevant modeling
   choices that explain the main differences between characterization
   models leading to the same impact indicators; (2) quantify the
   significance of the differences between methods, and (3) discuss the
   main methodological choices in order to guide method development and
   harmonization efforts.
   The modeling choices are analysed for similarity of results (using mean
   relative difference) and model response consistency (through rank
   correlation coefficient). Uncertainty data associated with the choice of
   model are provided for each of the models analysed, and an average value
   is provided as a tool for sensitivity analyses.
   The results determined the modeling choices that significantly influence
   the indicators and should be further analysed and harmonised, such as
   the regional scale at which the scarcity indicator is calculated, the
   sources of underlying input data and the function adopted to describe
   the relationship between modeled scarcity indicators and the original
   withdrawal-to-availability or consumption-to-availability ratios. The
   inclusion or exclusion of impacts from domestic user deprivation and the
   inclusion or exclusion of trade effects both strongly influence human
   health impacts. At both midpoint and endpoint, the comparison showed
   that considering reduced water availability due to degradation in water
   quality, in addition to a reduction in water quantity, greatly
   influences results. Other choices are less significant in most regions
   of the world. Maps are provided to identify the regions in which such
   choices are relevant.
   This paper provides useful insights to better understand scarcity,
   availability and human health impact models for water use and identifies
   the key relevant modeling choices and differences, making it possible to
   quantify model uncertainty and the significance of these choices in a
   specific regional context. Maps of regions where these specific choices
   are of importance were generated to guide practitioners in identifying
   locations for sensitivity analyses in water footprint studies. Finally,
   deconstructing the existing models and highlighting the differences and
   similarities has helped to determine building blocks to support the
   development of a consensual method.}},

Abstract = {{Foreground/background segmentation via change detection in video
   sequences is often used as a stepping stone in high-level analytics and
   applications. Despite the wide variety of methods that have been
   proposed for this problem, none has been able to fully address the
   complex nature of dynamic scenes in real surveillance tasks. In this
   paper, we present a universal pixel-level segmentation method that
   relies on spatiotemporal binary features as well as color information to
   detect changes. This allows camouflaged foreground objects to be
   detected more easily while most illumination variations are ignored.
   Besides, instead of using manually set, frame-wide constants to dictate
   model sensitivity and adaptation speed, we use pixel-level feedback
   loops to dynamically adjust our method's internal parameters without
   user intervention. These adjustments are based on the continuous
   monitoring of model fidelity and local segmentation noise levels. This
   new approach enables us to outperform all 32 previously tested
   state-of-the-art methods on the 2012 and 2014 versions of the
   ChangeDetection. net dataset in terms of overall F-Measure. The use of
   local binary image descriptors for pixel-level modeling also facilitates
   high-speed parallel implementations: our own version, which used no
   low-level or architecture-specific instruction, reached real-time
   processing speed on a midlevel desktop CPU. A complete C++
   implementation based on OpenCV is available online.}},

Abstract = {{A new fluidized bed thermogravimetric analyzer (FB-TGA) was developed
   that introduces two major particularities: the pseudo variation of the
   weight of the reactor and the special strategy for gas flow rate
   adjustment according to temperature. A momentum balance was performed on
   the reactor and the pseudo variation of the reactor weight was evaluated
   by measuring the pressure drop through the gas distributor and filter.
   The real weight loss of the reactor was obtained by subtracting the
   pseudo variation of the weight from the total weight loss measured by
   the load cell. In addition, a special program for the gas flow rate as a
   function of temperature was developed and used; so the minimum
   fluidization regime is maintained throughout all of the experiments. The
   validation test of the FB-TGA was carried out on calcium hydroxide
   decomposition, and the results were compared with those obtained from
   the conventional TGA. Diffusion control was suppressed by the
   application of the FB-TGA, which was confirmed by the x-ray diffraction
   analysis on the treated samples. (c) 2014 American Institute of Chemical

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional atomic crystals of graphene, as well as transition-metal
   dichalcogenides, have emerged as a class of materials that demonstrate
   strong interaction with light. This interaction can be further
   controlled by embedding such materials into optical microcavities. When
   the interaction rate is engineered to be faster than dissipation from
   the light and matter entities, one reaches the `strong coupling' regime.
   This results in the formation of half-light, half-matter bosonic
   quasiparticles called microcavity polaritons. Here, we report evidence
   of strong light-matter coupling and the formation of microcavity
   polaritons in a two-dimensional atomic crystal of molybdenum disulphide
   (MoS2) embedded inside a dielectric microcavity at room temperature. A
   Rabi splitting of 46 +/- 3 meV is observed in angle-resolved
   reflectivity and photoluminescence spectra due to coupling between the
   two-dimensional excitons and the cavity photons. Realizing strong
   coupling at room temperature in two-dimensional materials that offer a
   disorder-free potential landscape provides an attractive route for the
   development of practical polaritonic devices.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an improvement to the probabilistic discrete cracking
   model of fibre reinforced concretes, developed in the past by Pierre
   Rossi, is proposed.
   In this new model:
   - Cracks creation and propagation in the concrete are taken into account
   by using special interface elements. These interface elements open when
   the normal tensile stress at their centre of gravity reaches a critical
   value. The probabilistic aspect of the cracking process is given by the
   fact that the critical value of the tensile stress is randomly
   distributed through the mesh elements.
   - Immediately after the creation of cracks, the fibres bridging effect
   is then taken into account in a damage model approach. The probabilistic
   aspect consists of randomly distributing the post-cracking energy.
   The improved numerical model is used to analyze the shear behaviour of a
   steel fibre reinforced concrete beam. The numerical simulations are
   compared with the experimental results in terms of the beam's global
   behaviour and the cracking process (number of cracks, spacing and
   opening). The numerical and experimental results agree well. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Recently, optical interconnects have been proposed for ultra-high
   bandwidth and low latency inter/intra-chip communication in
   multiprocessor systems-on-chip (MPSoCs). These optical interconnects
   employ the microresonators (MRs) to direct/detect the optical signal.
   However, utilized MRs suffer from intrinsic crosstalk noise and power
   loss, degrading the network efficiency via the signal-to-noise ratio
   (SNR). In this paper, both coherent and incoherent crosstalk in
   wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) networks are discussed and
   systematically analyzed. We carefully develop our analytical models at
   the optical-circuit level, and apply them to two ring-based networks:
   SUOR and Corona ONoCs. The quantitative results have demonstrated that
   the architectural design of the ONoCs determines the impact of crosstalk
   on the SNR. Even though SUOR and Corona are both ring-based ONoCs, the
   worst-case SNR can be differed up to 50dB. Our analyses of the
   worst-case SNR can be utilized as a platform to compare the realistic
   performance among different optical interconnection networks via the
   degradation of BER and data bandwidth.}},

Abstract = {{Optical Network-on-Chip (ONoC) is an emerging technology considered as
   one of the key solutions for future generation on-chip interconnects.
   However, silicon photonic devices in ONoC are highly sensitive to
   temperature variation, which leads to a lower efficiency of
   Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Lasers (VCSELs), a resonant wavelength
   shift of Microring Resonators (MR), and results in a lower Signal to
   Noise Ratio (SNR). In this paper, we propose a methodology enabling
   thermal-aware design for optical interconnects relying on
   CMOS-compatible VCSEL. Thermal simulations allow designing ONoC
   interfaces with low gradient temperature and analytical models allow
   evaluating the SNR.}},

   dependence}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF QUALITY IN MAINTENANCE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{346+}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate age replacement
   policies for two-component parallel system with stochastic dependence.
   The stochastic dependence considered, is modeled by a one-sided domino
   effect. The failure of component 1 at instant t may induce the failure
   of component 2 at instant t+tau with probability p1(-> 2). The time
   delay tau is a random variable with known probability density function
   h(p1)-> (2)(.). The system is considered in a failed state when both
   components are failed. The proposed replacement policies suggest to
   replace the system upon failure or at age T whichever occurs first.
   Design/methodology/approach - In the first policy, costs and durations
   associated withmaintenance activities are supposed to be constant. In
   the second replacement policy, the preventive replacement cost depends
   on the system's state and age. The expected cost per unit of time over
   an infinite span is derived and numerical examples are presented.
   Findings - In this paper and especially in the second policy, the
   authors find that the authors can get a more economical policy if the
   authors consider that the preventive replacement cost is not constant
   but depends on T.
   Originality/value - In this paper, the authors take into account of the
   stochastic dependence between system components. This dependence affects
   the global reliability of the system and replacement's periodicity. It
   can be used to measure the performance of the system et introduced into
   design phase of the system.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we investigate adaptive approaches to control errors in
   response surface approximations computed from numerical approximations
   of differential equations with uncertain or random data and
   coefficients. The adaptivity of the response surface approximation is
   based on a posteriori error estimation, and the approach relies on the
   ability to decompose the a posteriori error estimate into contributions
   from the physical discretization and the approximation in parameter
   space. Errors are evaluated in terms of linear quantities of interest
   using adjoint-based methodologies. We demonstrate that a significant
   reduction in the computational cost required to reach a given error
   tolerance can be achieved by refining the dominant error contributions
   rather than uniformly refining both the physical and stochastic
   discretization. Error decomposition is demonstrated for a
   two-dimensional flow problem, and adaptive procedures are tested on a
   convection-diffusion problem with discontinuous parameter dependence and
   a diffusion problem, where the diffusion coefficient is characterized by
   a 10-dimensional parameter space.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In designing a supply chain (SC) system, the problem arises when a
   company has unsatisfactory inventory control policy and material routing
   between supplier-producer and distributor in SC considering specified
   cost and demand. The integration of decisions of different functions
   into a single optimization model is the base of this research. The aim
   of this paper is to study and compare the existing models of supply,
   production and distribution in SC and propose a model which integrates
   mentioned criteria in supply chain management (SCM). Furthermore, it
   proposes a new method for calculation of fitness function in genetic
   algorithm (GA) process. The successful designing of this model has led
   us to explore the use of heuristic methods such as GA to quantify the
   flow of SC, information and material flow. At first, fuzzy analytic
   hierarchy process (FAHP) is adapted to evaluate objective function
   weights in SC. Then final weights of objective function are determined
   by the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution
   (TOPSIS). This research also simulated the real company SC operations,
   and determines the most effective strategic and operational policies for
   an effective SC system. The result obtained from the model shows that it
   is robust. This model can also be applied to other industrial
   environments with slight modifications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This work is part of a series of investigations on pyrolysis of lignin.
   After obtaining the necessary information regarding the quantity and
   quality of the obtained products, a first step economics evaluation for
   converting lignin into chemicals was essential. To accomplish this aim,
   a pyrolysis plant with a 50 t/d capacity was designed, and the total
   capital investment and operating costs were estimated. Next, the minimal
   selling price of the obtained dry oil was calculated and the effect of
   crucial variables on the estimated price was examined. The key result
   indicates the estimated selling price would not compete with the price
   of the chemicals that are fossil fuel based, which is primarily due to
   the high cost of the feed-stock. To overcome this challenge, different
   scenarios for reducing the selling price of the obtained oil, which
   consequently is helping by taking a place among the fossil fuel based
   chemicals, were discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a crack model that couples the benefits of the
   damage mechanics approach and the extended finite element method (XFEM).
   A crack-tracking technique is developed to propagate the crack path
   along a single row of finite elements as a function of the stress-based
   nonlocal method. The level sets are computed to predict the crack path,
   and the path is corrected with the use of continuum damage mechanics.
   Once a certain level of damage is reached inside an element, the
   previously-computed level sets are used to apply the XFEM formulation. A
   cohesive XFEM formulation is used to transfer energy dissipation from
   the damage mechanics approach to the XFEM model. Using numerous test
   cases, it is shown that the model is mesh independent and that it
   removes the spurious stress transfer exhibited by continuum damage
   models. Various transition damage criteria are compared, and the optimal
   one is determined. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Microfracture repair tissue in young adult humans and in rabbit trochlea
   is frequently of higher quality than in corresponding ovine or horse
   models or in the rabbit medial femoral condyle (MFC). This may be
   related to differences in subchondral properties since repair is
   initiated from the bone. We tested the hypothesis that subchondral bone
   from rabbit trochlea and the human MFC are structurally similar.
   Trochlea and MFC samples from rabbit, sheep, and horse were micro-CT
   scanned and histoprocessed. Samples were also collected from normal and
   lesional areas of human MFC. The subchondral bone of the rabbit trochlea
   was the most similar to human MFC, where both had a relatively thin bone
   plate and a more porous and less dense character of subchondral bone.
   MFC from animals all displayed thicker bone plates, denser and less
   porous bone and thicker trabeculae, which may be more representative of
   older or osteoarthritic patients, while both sheep trochlear ridges and
   the horse lateral trochlea shared some structural features with human
   MFC. Since several cartilage repair procedures rely on subchondral bone
   for repair, subchondral properties should be accounted for when choosing
   animal models to study and test procedures that are intended for human
   cartilage repair. (c) 2014 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by

Abstract = {{In this study, a polymer coating approach was applied to increase and
   adjust the level of cohesive interparticle forces (IPFs) in a gas-solid
   fluidized bed. This novel approach is based on coating spherical inert
   particles with a polymer material having a low glass transition
   temperature followed by using the coated particles in a gas-solid
   fluidized bed. Since the level of artificial IPFs inside the bed depends
   on the temperature of the coated particles, it was simply controlled by
   the temperature of the inlet air. Accordingly, the system temperature
   was gradually varied near and slightly above the glass transition
   temperature of the polymer, between 20 and 40 degrees C, to investigate
   the influence of IPFs on the fluidization behavior of the bed at
   different superficial gas velocities, covering fixed bed state,
   bubbling, and turbulent fluidization regimes. The study of hydrodynamics
   was carried out through the visual observation of bed height, the
   measurement of bed pressure drop, and the recording pressure signals in
   the windbox and dense bed. Experimental results indicated that enhancing
   the level of IPFs in the bed can alter the fluidization behavior of the
   bed from Geldart (Geldart, 1973) group B behavior to Geldart group A and
   even Geldart group C behaviors, result in a fixed bed with a looser
   structure that can hold more gas inside, increase the characteristic
   fluidization velocities, such as minimum fluidization velocity and
   transition velocity from a bubbling to turbulent fluidization regime,
   increase the tendency of the fluidizing gas passing through the emulsion
   phase in the bubbling regime, and result in a noticeably larger bubble
   size at gas velocities slightly higher than the bubbling to turbulent
   transition velocity of the bed without IPFs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Land use management is one of the most critical factors influencing soil
   carbon storage and the global carbon cycle. This study evaluates the
   impact of land use change on the soil carbon stock in the Karasu region
   of Turkey which in the last two decades has undergone substantial
   deforestation to expand hazelnut plantations. Analysis of seasonal soil
   data indicated that the carbon content decreased rapidly with depth for
   both land uses. Statistical analyses indicated that the difference
   between the surface carbon stock (defined over 0-5 cm depth) in
   agricultural and forested areas is statistically significant
   (Agricultural = 1.74 kg/m(2), Forested = 2.09 kg/m(2), p = 0.014). On
   the other hand, the average carbon stocks estimated over the 0-1 m depth
   were 12.36 and 12.12 kg/m(2) in forested and agricultural soils,
   respectively. The carbon stock (defined over 1 m depth) in the two land
   uses were not significantly different which is attributed in part to the
   negative correlation between carbon stock and bulk density (-0.353, p <
   0.01). The soil carbon stock over the entire study area was mapped using
   a conditional kriging approach which jointly uses the collected soil
   carbon data and satellite-based land use images. Based on the kriging
   map, the spatially soil carbon stock (0-1 m dept) ranged about 2 kg/m(2)
   in highly developed areas to more than 23 kg/m(2) in intensively
   cultivated areas as well as the averaged soil carbon stock (0-1 m depth)
   was estimated as 10.4 kg/m(2). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Modular multilevel converter (MMC) structures are composed of several
   hundreds to thousands of half-bridge converters. Such large numbers of
   power switches and electrical nodes introduce important numerical
   challenges for the computation of electromagnetic transients. The
   problem becomes particularly more complex for the real-time simulations.
   This paper presents a feasibility study on the real-time simulation of
   the MMC models. CPU-based and field-programmable gate array-based
   implementations are proposed and evaluated for the MMCs having up to 401
   levels. The study also provides guidelines for the real-time simulation
   platform requirements to simulate these MMC models.}},

Title = {{Thermoelectric power enhancement by way of flow impedance for fixed
   thermal input conditions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},

Abstract = {{Liquid-to-liquid thermoelectric generators are now being considered for
   the purpose of converting low cost heat to electricity for local energy
   uses. The importance in investigating their system efficiency lies in
   the fact that the generator's purpose is to maintain a heat source and a
   heat sink for its embedded thermoelectric modules. Of particular
   importance is the generator's ability to maintain an asymmetric thermal
   field across its embedded modules since this mechanism partially
   dictates the devices' thermal to electric conversion efficiency. Indeed,
   since the modules' semiconductor materials' ability to generate an
   electromotive force is dependent on the quality of the thermal dipole
   across the material, gains in thermoelectric generator energy conversion
   efficiency are made possible with thermal system management. In an
   effort to improve the system conversion efficiency of a liquid-to-liquid
   thermoelectric generator (TEG), the present work builds upon recent
   advancements in TEG inner pipe flow optimisation by investigating the
   thermoelectric power enhancement brought upon by flow impeding panel
   inserts in a thermoelectric generator's flow channels for fixed thermal
   input conditions and with respect to varying insert panel densities. The
   pumping penalty associated with the flow impedance is measured in order
   to present and to discuss the net thermoelectric power enhancement. (C)

Title = {{On the energy cost of robustness and resiliency in IP networks}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{A}},

Month = {{DEC 24}},
Abstract = {{Despite the growing concern for the energy consumption of the Internet,
   green strategies for network and traffic management cannot undermine
   Quality of Service (QoS) and network survivability. In particular, two
   very important issues that may be affected by green networking
   techniques are resilience to node and link failures, and robustness to
   traffic variations.
   In this paper, we study how achieving different levels of resiliency and
   robustness impacts the network energy-aware efficiency. We propose novel
   optimization models to minimize the energy consumption of IP networks
   that explicitly guarantee network survivability to failures and
   robustness to traffic variations. Energy consumption is reduced by
   putting in sleep mode idle line cards and nodes according to traffic
   variations in different periods of the day. To guarantee network
   survivability we consider two different schemes, dedicated and shared
   protection, which assign a backup path to each traffic demand and some
   spare capacity on the links along the path. Robustness to traffic
   variations is provided by tuning the capacity margin on active links in
   order to accommodate load variations of different magnitude.
   Furthermore, we impose some inter-period constraints to guarantee
   network stability and preserve device lifetime. Both exact and heuristic
   methods are proposed.
   Experimentations carried out on realistic networks operated with
   flow-based routing protocols (like MPLS) allow us to quantitatively
   analyze the trade-off between energy cost and level of protection and
   robustness. Results show that significant savings, up to 30\%, may be
   achieved even when both survivability and robustness are fully
   guaranteed, both with exact and heuristic approaches. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Journal = {{CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{114}},
Pages = {{222-229}},
Month = {{DEC 19}},
Abstract = {{The mechanical behavior of polymer blends containing 80 wt\% of HDPE and
   20 wt\% of TPS and compatibilized with HDPE-g-MA grafted copolymer was
   investigated. Unmodified HDPE/TPS blends exhibit high fracture
   resistance, however, the interfacial modification of those blends by
   addition of HDPE-g-MA leads to a dramatic drop in fracture resistance.
   The compatibilization of HDPE/TPS blends increases the surface area of
   TPS particles by decreasing their size. It was postulated that the
   addition of HDPE-g-MA induces a reaction between maleic anhydride and
   hydroxyl groups of the glycerol leading to a decrease of the glycerol
   content in the TPS phase. This phenomenon increases the stiffness of the
   modified TPS particles and stiffer TPS particles leading to an important
   reduction in toughness and plastic deformation, as measured by the EWF
   method. It is shown that the main toughening mechanism in HDPE/TPS
   blends is shear-yielding. This article demonstrates that stiff, low
   diameter TPS particles reduce shear band formation and consequently
   decrease the resistance to crack propagation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to understand the links between the
   management of operating rooms and nurses, and to investigate the
   trade-offs between the number of operating rooms used, nurses used and
   overtime work. To do so, we proposed a model that plans and schedules
   surgical interventions in the operating rooms while considering the
   availabilities of surgeons and anesthesiologists; the model also
   includes or discards nurse scheduling. The flexible modeling approach
   allows us to compare different alternatives, each one representing a
   different scenario of managing the operating rooms at an operational
   level. The scenarios were applied to two data-sets and compared on the
   basis of performance indicators, which include operating costs,
   utilisation rates of nurses and number of overtime hours done. The
   important findings were that there is no relationship between the number
   of nurses required and the number of operating rooms used; the
   simultaneous scheduling of nurses and surgical interventions provided a
   better resource usage, a higher occupation rate of nurses, less overtime
   and furthermore, operating costs were lowered by at least 10\% on
   average.}},

Title = {{Experimental heat-bath cooling of spins}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{129}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{Algorithmic cooling (AC) is a method to purify quantum systems, such as
   ensembles of nuclear spins, or cold atoms in an optical lattice. When
   applied to spins, AC produces ensembles of highly polarized spins, which
   enhance the signal strength in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).
   According to this cooling approach, spin-half nuclei in a constant
   magnetic field are considered as bits, or more precisely quantum bits,
   in a known probability distribution. Algorithmic steps on these bits are
   then translated into specially designed NMR pulse sequences using common
   NMR quantum computation tools. The algorithmic cooling of spins is
   achieved by alternately combining reversible, entropy-preserving
   manipulations (borrowed from data compression algorithms) with selective
   reset, the transfer of entropy from selected spins to the environment.
   In theory, applying algorithmic cooling to sufficiently large spin
   systems may produce polarizations far beyond the limits due to
   conservation of Shannon entropy. Here, only selective reset steps are
   performed, hence we prefer to call this process ``heat-bath{''} cooling,
   rather than algorithmic cooling. We experimentally implemented two
   consecutive steps of selective reset, thus transferring entropy from two
   selected spins to the environment. We performed such cooling
   experiments, with commercially available labeled molecules, on standard
   liquid-state NMR spectrometers. We report in particular on our original
   experiment, unpublished until now except on the arXiv (quant-ph/0511156)
   in 2005, which was, to the best of our knowledge, the world's first
   experiment that yielded polarizations results that bypassed Shannon's
   entropy-conservation bound, so that the entire spin-system was cooled.}},

Abstract = {{In spite of its tremendous economic significance, the problem of sales
   staff schedule optimization for retail stores has received relatively
   scant attention. Current approaches typically attempt to minimize
   payroll costs by closely fitting a staffing curve derived from exogenous
   sales forecasts, oblivious to the ability of additional staff to
   (sometimes) positively impact sales. In contrast, this paper frames the
   retail scheduling problem in terms of operating profit maximization,
   explicitly recognizing the dual role of sales employees as sources of
   revenues as well as generators of operating costs. We introduce a
   flexible stochastic model of retail store sales, estimated from
   store-specific historical data, that can account for the impact of all
   known sales drivers, including the number of scheduled staff, and
   provide an accurate sales forecast at a high intra-day resolution. We
   also present solution techniques based on mixed-integer (MIP) and
   constraint programming (CP) to efficiently solve the complex mixed
   integer non-linear scheduling (MINLP) problem with a profit-maximization
   objective. The proposed approach allows solving full weekly schedules to
   optimality, or near-optimality with a very small gap. On a case-study
   with a medium-sized retail chain, this integrated forecasting scheduling
   methodology yields significant projected net profit increases on the
   order of 2-3\% compared to baseline schedules. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The hybrid membrane process (HMP) coupling powdered activated carbon
   (PAC) and low-pressure membrane filtration is emerging as a promising
   new option to remove dissolved contaminants from drinking water. Yet,
   defining optimal HMP operating conditions has not been confirmed. In
   this study, ammonia removal occurring in the PAC contactor of an HMP was
   simulated at lab-scale. Kinetics were monitored using three PAC
   concentrations (1-5-10 g L-1), three PAC ages (0-10-60 days), two
   temperatures (7-22 degrees C), in ambient influent condition (100 mu g
   N-NH4 L-1) as well as with a simulated peak pollution scenario (1000 mu
   g N-NH4 L-1). The following conclusions were drawn: i) Using a colonized
   PAC in the HMP is essential to reach complete ammonia removal, an older
   PAC offers a higher resilience to temperature decrease as well as lower
   operating costs; PAC concentration inside the HMP reactor is not a key
   operating parameter as under the conditions tested, PAC colonization was
   not limited by the available surface; iii) ammonia flux limited biomass
   growth and iv) hydraulic retention time was a critical parameter. In the
   case of a peak pollution, the process was most probably
   phosphate-limited but a mixed adsorption/nitrification still allowed
   reaching a 50\% ammonia removal. Finally, a kinetic model based on these
   experiments is proposed to predict ammonia removal occurring in the PAC
   reactor of the HMP. The model determines the relative importance of the
   adsorption and biological oxidation of ammonia on colonized PAC, and
   demonstrates the combined role of nitrification and residual adsorption
   capacity of colonized PAC. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The capability of efficiently injecting charge carriers into organic

   improve the performance of organic thin film transistors (OTFTs). In
   this work, we investigate OTFTs employing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as the
   source-drain electrodes and, as the organic semiconductor, thin films of
   titanyl phthalocyanine (TiOPc) grown by supersonic molecular beam
   deposition (SuMBD). While CNT electrodes have shown an unprecedented
   ability to improve charge injection in OTFTs, SuMBD is an effective
   technique to tune film morphology and structure. Varying the substrate
   temperature during deposition, we were able to grow both amorphous (low
   substrate temperature) and polycrystalline (high substrate temperature)
   films of TiOPc. Regardless of the film morphology and structure, CNT
   electrodes led to superior charge injection and transport performance
   with respect to benchmark Au electrodes. Vacuum annealing of
   polycrystalline TiOPc films with CNT electrodes yielded ambipolar OTFTs.}},

Abstract = {{In the majority of fluid-structure interaction problems, the biggest
   challenge lies in the fundamental understanding of the flow physics.
   Forced mixing layers is an important phenomenon found in many cases of
   flow-induced vibrations and acoustics. The response of a mixing layer to
   high-speed stream acoustic forcing is investigated with a theoretical
   and experimental approach. Two different experiments demonstrating the
   fluid mechanic phenomenon are presented. The first experiment consists
   of a circular jet impinging on a vibrating plate. The second experiment
   demonstrates the mixing layer resonance in the context of a fluidelastic
   instability causing high-amplitude vibrations in gas turbine
   high-pressure compressor rotor blades. Both the plate and the adjacent
   blade vibration induce an acoustic feedback that propagates within the
   jet and blade tip clearance flow, respectively. The resonance was found
   to occur when the feedback wavelength matched either the jet-to-plate or
   the inter-blade distance. In both experimental cases, the resonance
   condition has been simply modeled by the coincidence of a 1D feedback
   wave, which propagates upstream at reduced velocity by the high-speed
   flow. The coupling between the jet induced mixing layer and the feedback
   wave is assumed to naturally occur when one of the wave crests reaches
   the separation edge. The objective of this study is to improve the
   understanding of the coupling mechanism between an emanating shear layer
   and the acoustic forcing originating within a fast flow stream. The
   study is based on a simplified analytical model in order to enlarge the
   current understanding of the mixing layer receptivity to the more
   specific case of its response to high-speed stream forcing. To identify
   the mixing layer resonant modes, an analytical resonance condition is
   proposed. It is found that the mixing layer response becomes spatially
   resonant for specific source locations downstream in the high-speed
   flow. The study also provides an analytical mean to capture the critical
   source location periodicity that has been experimentally observed. The
   resulting theoretical prediction of the resonant source locations is in
   good agreement with the experimental data. Therefore, it supports the
   stream forced mixing layer analytical model and the proposed spatial
   resonance condition. The simple 1D reduced speed feedback wave model,
   which has been used to identify the experimental resonance conditions,
   is also in good agreement, and thus validated, with the results of this
   study. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   The presented approach uses cokriging prediction with derivatives. The

Abstract = {{What is the organization of cerebral microvascular oxygenation and
   morphology that allows adequate tissue oxygenation at different activity
   levels? We address this question in the mouse cerebral cortex using
   microscopic imaging of intravascular O-2 partial pressure and blood flow
   combined with numerical modelling. Here we show that parenchymal
   arterioles are responsible for 50\% of the extracted O-2 at baseline
   activity, and the majority of the remaining O-2 exchange takes place
   within the first few capillary branches. Most capillaries release little
   O-2 at baseline acting as an O-2 reserve that is recruited during
   increased neuronal activity or decreased blood flow. Our results
   challenge the common perception that capillaries are the major site of
   O-2 delivery to cerebral tissue. The understanding of oxygenation
   distribution along arterio-capillary paths may have profound
   implications for the interpretation of blood-oxygen-level dependent
   (BOLD) contrast in functional magnetic resonance imaging and for
   evaluating microvascular O-2 delivery capacity to support cerebral
   tissue in disease.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Manganese neurotoxicity is well documented in individuals
   occupationally exposed to airborne particulates, but few data are
   available on risks from drinking-water exposure.
   OBJECTIVE: We examined associations of exposure from concentrations of
   manganese in water and hair with memory, attention, motor function, and
   parent- and teacher-reported hyperactive behaviors.
   METHODS: We recruited 375 children and measured manganese in home tap
   water (MnW) and hair (MnH). We estimated manganese intake from water
   ingestion. Using structural equation modeling, we estimated associations
   between neuro-behavioral functions and MnH, MnW, and manganese intake
   from water. We evaluated exposure-response relationships using
   generalized additive models.
   RESULTS: After adjusting for potential confounders, a 1-SD increase in
   log(10) MnH was associated with a significant difference of -24\% (95\%
   CI: -36, -12\%) SD in memory and -25\% (95\% CI: -41, -9\%) SD in
   attention. The relations between log(10) MnH and poorer memory and
   attention were linear. A 1-SD increase in log(10) MnW was associated
   with a significant difference of -14\% (95\% CI: -24, -4\%) SD in
   memory, and this relation was nonlinear, with a steeper decline in
   performance at MnW > 100 mu g/L. A 1-SD increase in log(10) manganese
   intake from water was associated with a significant difference of -11\%
   (95\% CI: -21, -0.4\%) SD in motor function. The relation between
   log(10) manganese intake and poorer motor function was linear. There was
   no significant association between manganese exposure and hyperactivity.
   CONCLUSION: Exposure to manganese in water was associated with poorer
   neuro-behavioral performances in children, even at low levels commonly
   encountered in North America.}},

Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a new queueing model providing the accurate
   average system time for packets transmitted over a cognitive radio (CR)
   link for multiple traffic classes with the preemptive and non-preemptive
   priority service disciplines. The analysis considers general packet
   service time, general distributions for the channel availability periods
   and service interruption periods, and a service-resume transmission. We
   further introduce and analyze two novel priority service disciplines for
   opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) networks which take advantage of
   interruptions to preempt low priority traffic at a low cost. Analytical
   results, in addition to simulation results to validate their accuracy,
   are also provided and used to illustrate the impact of different OSA
   network parameters on the average system time. We particularly show
   that, for the same average CR transmission link availability, the packet
   system time significantly increases in a semi-static network with long
   operating and interruption periods compared to an OSA network with fast
   alternating operating and interruption periods. We also present results
   indicating that, due to the presence of interruptions, priority queueing
   service disciplines provide a greater differentiated service in OSA
   networks than in traditional networks. The analytical tools presented in
   this paper are general and can be used to analyze the traffic metrics of
   most OSA networks carrying multiple classes of traffic with priority
   queueing service differentiation.}},

Abstract = {{The phase transformation sequence and solidification behaviour of an
   Al-13Mg-7Si-2Cu in-situ composite was examined using a combination of
   computer-aided cooling curve thermal analysis and interrupted quenching
   techniques. Five different phases were identified by analysing the
   derivative cooling curves, the X-ray diffraction profile, optical and
   scanning electron microscopy images and the corresponding energy
   dispersive spectroscopy. It has been found that the solidification of
   this alloy begins with primary Mg2Si precipitation and continues with
   the formation of eutectic Al-Mg2Si, followed by Al5FeSi and simultaneous
   precipitation of Al5Cu2Mg8Si6 and Al2Cu complex intermetallic phases.
   The formation of the last three intermetallic compounds changes the
   solidification behaviour of these composites remarkably due to their
   complex eutectic formation reactions. The solidification of the alloy,
   calculated using the Factsage thermochemical analysis software, has
   demonstrated a good agreement with the experiments in terms of compound
   prediction, their weight fractions and reaction temperatures. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{This paper aims at characterizing additional delays induced by ionizing
   radiation in Input/Output Blocks (IOBs) of Static Random-Access Memory
   Based Field Programmable Gate Arrays (SRAM-Based FPGAs), using
   measurement techniques based on ring oscillators (ROs). This
   characterization effort includes experiments performed with proton
   irradiation at TRIUMF on Xilinx devices (Virtex-5 and Artix-7). Results
   from these irradiation experiments show that RO period variations, up to
   6.2 ns for Virtex-5 and 3.8 ns for Artix-7, could be induced. These
   results also reveal that the occurrence rate of events (namely delays
   and breaks) affecting ROs implemented in IOBs is approaching the rate
   observed when ROs are implemented in the FPGA core, even if the number
   of configuration bits dedicated to IOBs is significantly lower than for
   the FPGA core. These radiation test experiments are supported by
   emulation using similar RO-based measurement techniques and Xilinx SEU
   Controller as a fault injector. The fault injection experiments allow a
   better understanding of the behaviour of IOBs affected by additional
   delays due to configuration bit flips, which in many cases is similar to
   what can be observed with an incorrect parameter setting. Emulation
   experiments also reveal that many of the events modifying IOB behaviour
   are found to require multiple bit fault injection.}},

Abstract = {{Mobility management is one major challenge for wireless network design.
   Advanced wireless technologies provide mobile nodes with multi-mode
   radio interfaces, so subscribers can benefit from disparate mobile
   communication systems. Meanwhile, researchers are putting efforts into
   standardization of IPv6-based mobility protocols. Hence, wireless
   networks can offer more flexible mobility support than ever before.
   However, as the demands for high-speed Internet access and multimedia
   services increase, guaranteeing host mobility with quality of service
   provisioning becomes more difficult. Both network connectivity and
   session continuity need to be carefully handled during handover. This
   paper proposes a new mobility protocol, called seamless mobile IPv6
   (SMIPv6). Its novelty consists of pre-configuring bidirectional secure
   tunnels among access routers before handoff, as well as using such
   tunnels to guarantee handoff seamlessness. To evaluate the performance,
   simulations are conducted using OPNET Modeler v.12.0, of which results
   demonstrate that SMIPv6 delivers better performance than MIPv6 in terms
   of handoff latency and packet losses.}},

Abstract = {{Fabrication and characterization in the THz frequency range of silk
   foams and silk foam-based waveguides using lyophilisation and casting
   techniques are reported. The lack of biocompatible and biofriendly
   waveguides for low-loss, low-dispersion guidance of THz waves motivates
   the work for applications in remote and stand-off sensing in biomedical
   and agro-alimentary industries. Silk foams produced are 94\% porous.
   Optical characterization is carried out using THz time-domain
   spectroscopy. The cutback measurements of foam samples show that the
   foam refractive index is close to that of air (n(foam)(r) approximate to
   1.06). Silk foam losses scale quadratically with frequency (alpha(foam)
   {[}cm(-1)] approximate to 0.65+ 2.75. (v{[}THz](2)), being one order of
   magnitude smaller than those of solid silk. As an example of a basic
   guided wave device, fabrication and optical characterization of 10
   cm-long, 5 mm-diameter step-index THz fibers having silk foam in the
   core and air in the cladding is demonstrated. Cutback measurements
   confirm that in the mid-THz spectral range, step-index fibers operate
   effectively in a single mode regime. Effective refractive index and
   propagation loss at frequencies higher that 0.2 THz are close to that of
   a silk foam from which the fiber core is made. At the same time, at
   these frequencies, modal group velocity dispersion is smaller than
   0.2ps/(THz.cm).}},

Abstract = {{Concentrically braced frames (CBFs) with a tension-compression bracing
   system dissipate hysteretic energy when braces yield in tension and
   buckle in compression, whereas the hysteretic response of hallow
   structural section (HSS) braces varies with brace slenderness,
   width-to-thickness ratio, and yield strength. Modelling the nonlinear
   response of braces upon the fracture requires an assigned brace fracture
   model and implicitly calibrated input material parameters. The selected
   brace fracture models are those that are compatible to nonlinear
   analysis and fiber-based elements formulation suited to OpenSees
   framework. To replicate the brace response, nonlinear beam-column
   elements that encompass distributed plasticity and discretized fiber
   cross-sections were used, whereas to simulate brace fracture, the strain
   fatigue model was considered. In this study, in order to predict the
   failure strain for a single reversal value that is required as input
   parameter in the strain fatigue model, regression analysis was employed
   and the proposed equation was given for square HSS braces and validated
   against experimental test results for a wide range of brace slenderness
   ratios, 50 <= kL/r <= 150 and types of displacement loading history. The
   predicted failure strain value is expressed in terms of slenderness
   ratio, width-to-thickness ratio and yield strength of steel. Comparisons
   to existing brace fracture models, such as the strain-range and
   end-rotation of braces at fracture, are provided. All aforementioned
   brace fracture models were evaluated against experimental tests results,
   while replicating fourteen specimens that were found in the literature.}},

   creating re-usable image processing tools that can be used for image
   simplification and recognition tasks. One of the main challenges in the
   image processing path is the real-time restriction; hence they resort to
   field-programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware acceleration. Herein they
   demonstrate and describe the architecture of an image feature extractor
   based on the difference of Gaussians that is at once accurate, generic
   and low on resources. This architecture also features a Huffman encoding
   engine that proves useful when resorting to software-hardware (SW-HW)

Abstract = {{In recent years, industrial ecology (IE) has become increasingly
   integrated into formal education as a distinct body of work. The aim of
   this article is to describe the state of IE in postsecondary education
   across the world by providing an inventory of programs and courses
   offered from a search conducted during the summer of 2012. Although some
   interpretation of the results is conducted, the aim of this article is
   to provide a snapshot of the state of IE in higher education in 2012 and
   serve as a starting point for future work. Data were collected on IE
   courses and programs across the world by Internet search in order to
   determine the prevalence of IE in postsecondary curricula. Subsequently,
   190 universities and colleges from 46 countries were identified as
   offering courses and/or programs in IE. From this research, a total of
   409 courses and 78 programs were inventoried and course content was
   analyzed (where available). The results indicate that IE is mainly
   studied at the graduate level within engineering and environmental
   disciplines, although undergraduate-level curricula are emerging. In
   terms of disciplinary departments offering said curricula, IE is
   presented as a topic of instruction in varied fields of study, such as
   business and administration, and the arts. From the course syllabi
   analyzed, the main subjects being taught within IE education are
   introductory principles and general tools. Advanced or specialized
   aspects of the field are also covered, however, less frequently.}},

Pages = {{3815-3825}},

Abstract = {{The main focus of this paper is the experimental comparative analysis of
   the viscoelastic properties of acrylic- and silicon-based viscoelastic
   materials. These materials are widely used in the aeronautic industry
   for structural and/or damping applications. It is therefore required to
   determine their viscoelastic properties such as shear modulus and loss
   factor following their integration to aircraft composite structures. The
   influence of material thickness, bonding quality, curing and cocuring
   with composite material was evaluated using dynamic mechanical analysis
   machine in plan shear configuration. This comparative analysis in the
   0-600Hz frequency range provides useful information that should be taken
   into consideration when designing bonded joints for structural and/or
   damping applications. The small variation of the acrylic-based material
   loss factor over a wide range of frequencies suggests that this material
   is a good candidate for damping applications at room temperature in
   metallic structures where no curing is required. However, cocuring of
   acrylic-based material with composite laminae increases its shear
   modulus up to six times with respect to the uncured material whereas its
   loss factor is reduced by about 20\%. On the other hand, the
   silicon-based material remains stable after thermal treatment (curing
   and cocuring) suggesting that it is well suited for in situ damping
   treatment involving laminate composite structure. However, at room
   temperature its shear modulus after cocuring is lowered by almost 25\%
   due to poor bonding quality, which depends on the nature of the
   substrate.}},

Abstract = {{Characterization factors (CFs) are used in life cycle assessment (LCA)
   to quantify the potential impact per unit of emission. CFs are obtained
   from a characterization model which assess the environmental mechanisms
   along the cause-effect chain linking an emission to its potential damage
   on a given area of protection, such as loss in ecosystem quality. Up to
   now, CFs for acidifying emissions did not cover the global scale and
   were only representative of their characterization model geographical
   scope. Consequently, current LCA practices implicitly assume that all
   emissions from a global supply chain occur within the continent
   referring to the characterization method geographical scope. This paper
   provides worldwide 2 degrees x 2.5 degrees spatially-explicit CFs,
   representing the change in relative loss of terrestrial vascular plant
   species due to an emission change of nitrogen oxides (NO), ammonia (NH3)
   and sulfur dioxide (SO2). We found that spatial variability in the CFs
   is much larger compared to statistical uncertainty (six orders of
   magnitude vs. two orders of magnitude). Spatial variability is mainly
   caused by the atmospheric fate factor and soil sensitivity factor, while
   the ecological effect factor is the dominant contributor to the
   statistical uncertainty. The CFs provided in our study allow the

Abstract = {{In this work, we describe a simple spin-coating deposition technique for
   lead sulphide (PbS) and cadmium sulphide (CdS) films from a methanolic
   metal-thiourea complex. The characterization of the films by X-ray
   diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques revealed
   that pure cubic phase PbS and CdS layers were formed via this method. As
   shown by atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy
   results, both films were homogeneous and presented a smooth surface.
   Optical properties showed that the energy band gap of PbS and CdS films
   were around 1.65 and 2.5 eV, respectively. The PbS film is p-type in
   nature with an electrical conductivity of around 0.8 S/cm. The hole
   concentration and mobility were 2.35 x 10(18) cm(-3) and 2.16 x 10(-3)
   cm(2)/V/s, respectively, as determined from Hall measurement. Both films
   were used to develop a thin film solar cell device of
   graphite/PbS/CdS/ITO/glass. Device characterization showed the power
   conversion efficiency of around 0.24 \%. The corresponding open circuit
   voltage, short circuit current and fill factor were 0.570 V, 1.32
   mA/cm(2) and 0.32, respectively.}},

Title = {{Exposure of young children to household water lead in the Montreal area

   lead levels on children's blood lead concentration}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL}},

Abstract = {{Drinking water represents a potential source of lead exposure. The
   purpose of the present study was to estimate the magnitude of
   winter-to-summer changes in household water lead levels (WLLs), and to
   predict the impact of these variations on BLLs in young children. A
   study was conducted from September, 2009 to March, 2010 in 305 homes,
   with a follow-up survey carried out from June to September 2011 in a
   subsample of 100 homes randomly selected. The first 1-L sample was drawn
   after 5 min of flushing, followed by a further 4 consecutive 1-L samples
   after 30 min of stagnation. Non-linear regression and general linear
   mixed models were used for modelling seasonal effects on WLL. The
   batchrun mode of Integrated Exposure Uptake Biokinetic (IEUBK) model was
   used to predict the impact of changes in WLL on children's blood lead
   levels (BLLs). The magnitude of winter-to-summer changes in average
   concentrations of lead corresponded to 6.55 mu g/L in homes served by
   lead service lines (LSL+ homes) and merely 030 mu g/L in homes without
   lead service lines. For stagnant samples, the value reached 10.55 mu g/L
   in `LSL+ homes' and remained very low (036 mu g/L) in `LSL- homes'. The
   change in the probability of BLLs >= 5 mu g/dL due to winter-to-summer
   changes in WLL was increased from <5\% (in winter) to about 20\% (in
   summer) in children aged 0.5-2 years. The likelihood of having BLLs >= 5
   mu g/dL in young children during warm months was reduced by at least
   40\% by flushing tap-water. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Companies distributing heating oil typically solve vehicle routing
   problems on a daily basis. Their problems may involve various features
   such as a heterogeneous vehicle fleet, multiple depots, intra-route
   replenishments, time windows, driver shifts and optional customers. In
   this paper, we consider such a rich vehicle routing problem that arises
   in practice and develop three metaheuristics to address it, namely, a
   tabu search (TS) algorithm, a large neighborhood search (LNS) heuristic
   based on this TS heuristic and another LNS heuristic based on a column
   generation (CG) heuristic. Computational results obtained on instances
   derived from a real-world dataset indicate that the LNS methods
   outperform the TS heuristic. Furthermore, the LNS method based on CG
   tends to produce better quality results than the TS-based LNS heuristic,
   especially when sufficient computational time is available.}},

Abstract = {{Onshore oil fields may contain hundreds of wells that use sophisticated
   and complex equipments. These equipments need regular maintenance to
   keep the wells at maximum productivity. When the productivity of a well
   decreases, a specially-equipped vehicle called a workover rig must visit
   this well to restore its full productivity. Given a heterogeneous fleet
   of workover rigs and a set of wells requiring maintenance, the workover
   rig routing problem (WRRP) consists of finding rig routes that minimize
   the total production loss of the wells over a finite horizon. The wells
   have different loss rates, need different services, and may not be
   serviced within the horizon. On the other hand, the number of available
   workover rigs is limited, they have different initial positions, and
   they do not have the same equipments. This paper presents and compares
   four heuristics for the WRRP: an existing variable neighborhood search
   heuristic, a branch-price-and-cut heuristic, an adaptive large
   neighborhood search heuristic, and a hybrid genetic algorithm. These
   heuristics are tested on practical-sized instances involving up to 300
   wells, 10 rigs on a 350-period horizon. Our computational results
   indicate that the hybrid genetic algorithm outperforms the other
   heuristics on average and in most cases.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the implementation of a novel multi-class diagnostic
   technique for the detection and identification of faults based on an
   approach called logical analysis of data (LAD). LAD is a datamining,
   artificial intelligence approach that is based on pattern recognition.
   In the context of condition based maintenance (CBM), historical data
   containing condition indices and the state of the machine are the inputs
   to LAD. After training and testing phases, LAD generates patterns that
   characterize the faulty states according to the type of fault, and
   differentiate between these states and the normal state. These patterns
   are found by solving a mixed 0-1 integer linear programming problem.
   They are then used to detect and to identify a future unknown state of
   equipment. The diagnostic technique has already been tested on several
   known machine learning datasets. The results proved that the performance
   of this technique is comparable to other conventional approaches, such
   as neural network and support vector machine, with the added advantage
   of the clear interpretability of the generated patterns, which are rules
   characterizing the faults' types. To demonstrate its merit in fault
   diagnosis, the technique is used in the detection and identification of
   faults in power transformers using dissolved gas analysis data. The
   paper reaches the conclusion that the multi-class LAD based fault
   detection and identification is a promising diagnostic approach in CBM.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel hybrid GA-DEA algorithm in order to solve
   multi-objective k-out-of-n problem and determine preferred policy. The
   proposed algorithm maximizes overall system reliability and
   availability, while minimizing system cost and queue length,
   simultaneously. To meet these objectives, an adaptive hybrid GA-DEA
   algorithm is developed to identify the optimal solutions and improve
   computation efficiency. In order to improve computation efficiency
   genetic algorithm (GA) is used to simulate a series production line and
   find the Pareto-optimal solutions which are different values of k and n
   of k-out-of-n problem. Data envelopment analysis is used to find the
   best k and n from Genetic Algorithm's Pareto solutions. An illustrative
   example is applied to show the flexibility and effectiveness of the
   proposed algorithm. The proposed algorithm of this study would help
   managers to identify the preferred policy considering and investigating
   various parameters and scenarios in logical time. Also considering
   different objectives result in Pareto-optimal solutions that would help
   decision makers to select the preferred solution based on their
   situation and preference.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET)/Cloisite 30B (C30B) nanocomposites of
   different organoclay concentrations were prepared using a water-assisted
   extrusion process. The reduction of the molecular weight (M-w) of the
   PET matrix, caused by hydrolysis during water-assisted extrusion, was
   compensated by subsequent solid-state polymerization (SSP). Viscometry,
   titration, rheological, and dynamic scanning calorimetry measurements
   were used to analyze the samples from SSP. The weight-average molecular
   weight (M-w) of PET increased significantly through SSP. PET
   nanocomposites exhibited solid-like rheological behavior, and the
   complex viscosity at high frequencies was scaled with the M-w of PET.
   The Maron-Pierce model was used to evaluate the M-w of PET in the
   nanocomposites before and after SSP. It was found that the extent and
   the rate of the SSP reaction in nanocomposites were lower than those for
   the neat PETs, due to the barrier effect of clay platelets.
   Consequently, the SSP rate of PET increased with decreasing particle
   size for the neat PET and PET nanocomposites. The effect of the M-w of
   PET on the crystallization temperature, crystallinity, and the
   half-time, t(1/2), of nonisothermal crystallization was also
   investigated. With increasing M-w of PET, t(1/2) increased, whereas T-c
   and X-c decreased. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 54:2925-2937, 2014. (c) 2014

Abstract = {{Porous nanocomposite films based on polypropylene (PP) and titanium
   dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles were prepared by melt extrusion followed by
   uniaxial stretching. The effects of drawing temperature, extension rate,
   stretching ratio and composition of the base films on the final
   properties and microstructure of the stretched films were studied. Water
   vapor permeability (WVP) results showed a significant decrease in
   permeability of the films stretched at temperatures higher than 60
   degrees C. Porosity, pore size and water vapor transmission rate in the
   porous nanocomposite films had a direct relation with nanoparticle
   content, extension rate and stretching ratio. Study of the morphology of
   the stretched films, using SEM, revealed that the pores form due to
   PP/TiO2 interfacial debonding at low stretching ratios. Higher
   stretching ratios cause an enlargement of the pores and the formation of
   a PP fibril structure parallel to the stretching direction.
   Quantification of dye adsorption revealed that the quantity of adsorbed
   dye increased with porosity and surface area of the pores. (c) 2014

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to study the periodic arc-routing problem
   when the arcs of a network behave as customers, and sufficient material
   is delivered so that each achieves its desired inventory level.
   Therefore, routing and inventory decisions are made simultaneously.
   Applications include dust suppression in open-pit mines or forest roads
   and plant watering along sidewalks or street medians. A truck
   periodically sprays water along the edges of a network. The humidity
   reaches a desired level and is then consumed over time until water is
   delivered again. The quantity of water delivered can be fixed or
   variable; we consider both scenarios and propose a mathematical model
   for each. Results are reported to validate the model. The contribution
   of this paper is the first mathematical model that combines inventory
   and routing decisions in the arc-routing domain.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new stochastic simulation method that improves on
   our unilateral patchwork simulation method (Faucher et al., Stoch
   Environ Res Risk Assess, 27:253-273, 2012) by eliminating anisotropy
   biases. As in our unilateral method, images are built by assembling
   patterns together while controlling the local-mean histogram. The
   patterns, which are square image-pieces, are picked in a reference
   image. The reference image is used as a data bank holding the
   statistical informations about the random field to simulate. In contrast
   with the unilateral method, the path followed by our new simulation is
   random and guided by local errors. The new method, called corrective
   pattern-matching simulation, proceeds iteratively by making local
   corrections to the simulated image. For several types of images, it is
   shown that our simulations respect conditioning data and reproduce
   faithfully the reference image visual appearance. It is shown that the
   control of the local-mean histogram allows to control one-point
   statistics and multi-point statistics.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical models for computing the effective critical current of devices
   made of high-temperature superconducting tapes require the knowledge of
   the J(c)(B, theta) dependence, i.e., of the way the critical current
   density J(c) depends on the magnetic flux density B and its orientation.
   with respect to the tape. In this paper, we present a numerical model
   based on the critical state with angular field dependence of J(c) to
   extract the J(c)(B, theta) relation from experimental data. The model
   takes into account the self-field created by the tape, which gives an
   important contribution when the field applied in the experiments is low.
   The same model can be also used to compute the effective critical
   current of devices composed of electromagnetically interacting tapes. In
   this paper, we consider three examples: two differently current-rated
   Roebel cables composed of ten strands from REBCO coated conductors and a
   power cable prototype composed of 22 Bi-2223 tapes. The critical
   currents computed with the numerical model show good agreement with the
   measured ones. The simulations reveal also that several parameter sets
   in J(c)(B, theta) give an equally good representation of the
   experimental characterization of the tapes and that the measured I-c
   values of cables are subjected to the influence of experimental
   conditions, such as I-c degradation due to the manufacturing and
   assembling process and nonuniformity of the tape properties. These two
   aspects make the determination of a very precise J(c)(B, theta)
   expression probably unnecessary, as long as that expression is able to
   reproduce the main features of the observed angular dependence. The
   easiness of use of this model, which can be straightforwardly
   implemented in finite-element programs able to solve static
   electromagnetic problems, is very attractive both for researchers and
   device manufactures who want to characterize superconducting tapes and
   calculate the effective critical current of superconducting devices.}},

Abstract = {{We study in a unified manner the dissipative dynamics and the transfer
   of heat in the two-bath spin-boson model. We use the Bloch-Redfield (BR)
   formalism, valid in the very weak system-bath coupling limit, the
   noninteracting-blip approximation (NIBA), applicable in the nonadiabatic
   limit, and iterative, numerically exact path integral tools. These
   methodologies were originally developed for the description of the
   dissipative dynamics of a quantum system, and here they are applied to
   explore the problem of quantum energy transport in a nonequilibrium
   setting. Specifically, we study the weak-to-intermediate system-bath
   coupling regime at high temperatures k(B)T/? > epsilon, with e as the
   characteristic frequency of the two-state system. The BR formalism and
   NIBA can lead to close results for the dynamics of the reduced density
   matrix (RDM) in a certain range of parameters. However, relatively small
   deviations in the RDM dynamics propagate into significant qualitative
   discrepancies in the transport behavior. Similarly, beyond the strict
   nonadiabatic limit NIBA's prediction for the heat current is
   qualitatively incorrect: It fails to capture the turnover behavior of
   the current with tunneling energy and temperature. Thus, techniques that
   proved meaningful for describing the RDM dynamics, to some extent even
   beyond their rigorous range of validity, should be used with great
   caution in heat transfer calculations, because qualitative-serious
   failures develop once parameters are mildly stretched beyond the
   techniques' working assumptions.}},

Title = {{Buckling of a beam extruded into highly viscous fluid}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{Inspired by microscopic Paramecia which use trichocyst extrusion to
   propel themselves away from thermal aggression, we propose a macroscopic
   experiment to study the stability of a slender beam extruded in a highly
   viscous fluid. Piano wires were extruded axially at constant speed in a
   tank filled with corn syrup. The force necessary to extrude the wire was
   measured to increase linearly at first until the compressive viscous
   force causes the wire to buckle. A numerical model, coupling a
   lengthening elastica formulation with resistive-force theory, predicts a
   similar behavior. The model is used to study the dynamics at large time
   when the beam is highly deformed. It is found that at large time, a
   large deformation regime exists in which the force necessary to extrude
   the beam at constant speed becomes constant and length independent. With
   a proper dimensional analysis, the beam can be shown to buckle at a
   critical length based on the extrusion speed, the bending rigidity, and
   the dynamic viscosity of the fluid. Hypothesizing that the trichocysts
   of Paramecia must be sized to maximize their thrust per unit volume as
   well as avoid buckling instabilities, we predict that their bending
   rigidity must be about 3 x 10(-9) N mu m(2). The verification of this
   prediction is left for future work.}},

Title = {{Partial-route inequalities for the multi-vehicle routing problem with
   stochastic demands}},
Journal = {{DISCRETE APPLIED MATHEMATICS}},

Volume = {{177}},
Pages = {{121-136}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes an exact algorithm for a variant of the vehicle
   routing problem in which customer demands to be collected are
   stochastic. Demands are revealed upon the vehicle arrival at customer
   locations. As a result, a vehicle may reach a customer and does not have
   sufficient capacity to collect the realized demand. Such a situation is
   referred to as a failure. In this paper the following recourse action is
   then applied when failure occurs: the vehicle returns to the depot to
   unload and resumes its planned route at the point of failure. The
   capacitated vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands (VRPSD)
   consists of minimizing the sum of the planned routes cost and of the
   expected recourse cost. The VRPSD is formulated as a two-stage
   stochastic programming model and solved by means of an integer L-shaped
   algorithm. This paper introduces three lower bounding functionals based
   on the generation of general partial routes, as well as an exact
   separation procedure to identify violated cuts. Extensive computational
   results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, as measured
   by a substantial reduction in the number of feasible solutions that have
   to be explicitly eliminated. This translates into a higher proportion of
   instances solved to optimality, reduced optimality gaps, and lower
   computing times. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Evaluating rain gardens as a method to reduce the impact of sewer

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},

Volume = {{499}},

Abstract = {{The implications of climate change and changing precipitation patterns
   need to be investigated to evaluate mitigation measures for source water
   protection. Potential solutions need first to be evaluated under present
   climate conditions to determine their utility as climate change
   adaptation strategies. An urban drainage network receiving both
   stormwater and wastewater was studied to evaluate potential solutions to
   reduce the impact of combined sewer overflows (CSOs) in a drinking water
   source. A detailed hydraulic model was applied to the drainage basin to
   model the implementation of best management practices at a drainage
   basin scale. The model was calibrated and validated with field data of
   CSO flows for seven events from a survey conducted in 2009 and 2010.
   Rain gardens were evaluated for their reduction of volumes of water
   entering the drainage network and of CSOs. Scenarios with different
   levels of implementation were considered and evaluated. Of the total
   impervious area within the basin directly connected to the sewer system,
   a maximum of 21\% could be alternately directed towards rain gardens.
   The runoff reductions for the entire catchment ranged from 12.7\% to
   19.4\% depending on the event considered. The maximum discharged volume
   reduction ranged from 13\% to 62\% and the maximum peak flow rate
   reduction ranged from 7\% to 56\%. Of concern is that in-sewer sediment
   resuspension is an important process to consider with regard to the
   efficacy of best management practices aimed at reducing extreme loads
   and concentrations. Rain gardens were less effective for large events,
   which are of greater importance for drinking water sources. These
   practices could increase peak instantaneous loads as a result of greater
   in-sewer resuspension during large events. Multiple interventions would
   be required to achieve the objectives of reducing the number, total
   volumes and peak contaminant loads of overflows upstream of drinking
   water intakes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this investigation was to characterize the heat
   transfer capabilities of two microreactors and to demonstrate their
   potential as chemical reactors for conducting the continuous
   free-radical polymerization of styrene monomer. The microreactors
   operate respectively with the split-and-recombination (SAR) and the
   multilamination mixing mechanism; and both units feature an integrated
   forced-convection heat exchanger. For the highest flow conditions
   investigated, the SAR and multilamination heat exchangers achieved
   maximum overall heat transfer coefficients of 3.02 and 2.8 kW/m(2) K
   respectively reaching efficiencies of similar to 0.95. Monofunctional,
   bifunctional, and tetrafunctional peroxide initiators were used for the
   polymerization runs at two reaction temperatures, e.g. 100 and 130
   degrees C aiming at conversions of at least 30\%. The functionality of
   the chemical initiator in combination with the right processing
   temperature was the main factor allowing attaining this conversion goal.
   It was found that only the tetrafunctional initiator was able to produce
   the conversion level desired at both temperatures. Low values of
   polydispersity indexes (PDI < 1.7) were obtained for all the reaction
   conditions investigated with the samples obtained in the multilamination
   microreactor exhibiting an overall lower value than those produced in
   the SAR configuration. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   porous SiC ceramics. In this technique, SiC particles were coated with a

   techniques, respectively. After the formation of a green body, the
   porous samples were produced by pressureless sintering under air. The
   microstructures, phase components, and physical and mechanical
   properties of the developed porous ceramics were examined and compared
   with materials obtained by the traditional process. The results
   interpretation revealed that the flexural strength (35\%) and porosity
   (8\%), as well as the pore size of the samples fabricated by the novel
   process significantly increased as compared to regular ceramic parts.
   Further characterization indicated that the enhanced properties of the
   porous ceramics came from the good dispersion of the sintering additive

Abstract = {{This article reports the results obtained from an extensive experimental
   campaign aimed at investigating the effect of interparticle forces
   (IPFs) on the local flow structure of a gas-solid fluidized bed. A
   polymer coating approach was used to enhance and control the degree of
   cohesive IPFs in a gas-solid fluidized bed. In this work, the local
   transient solids concentration (bed voidage) was carefully measured with
   the help of an accurate optical fiber probe at different temperatures
   and gas velocities covering both bubbling and turbulent fluidization
   regimes. Also, the Radioactive Particle Tracking (RPT) technique was
   employed to track the trajectory of a tracer mimicking the behavior of
   solid particles in two systems, one with the least amount of IPFs in the
   bubbling regime and the other with the highest amount. Experimental
   results showed that by increasing the level of IPFs in the bed the fixed
   bed and emulsion phase voidage in the bubbling regime increased and
   demonstrated higher capacities in holding gas inside their structures.
   In addition, the emulsion phase fraction increased, the tendency of the
   fluidizing gas passing through the bed in the emulsion phase enhanced in
   the bubbling regime, the frequency of the bubble/emulsion phase cycle
   decreased, and the meso-scale transition from bubbling to turbulent
   fluidization regime delayed until reaching higher superficial gas
   velocities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved,}},

Abstract = {{Phase identification and the study of the interphase region in
   multi-component polymer blends with a chemically similar structure using
   conventional techniques is a challenge. In this work, the detailed
   morphological analysis of such systems is examined. A ternary blend
   comprised of poly butylene succinate (PBS); poly lactic acid (PLA); and
   polycaprolactone (PCL) with a partial wetting morphology is carefully
   selected since all three components are polyesters with low interfacial
   tensions. It will be shown that a novel technique by applying
   multivariate analysis (MVA) on time-of-flight secondary ion mass
   spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) data can effectively identify the complex phase
   structure, especially in blends with chemically similar components.
   Furthermore, for the first time for such systems, this technique
   provides detailed information about interfacial thicknesses and
   transitions. By employing the principal component analysis (PCA) method
   on the ToF-SIMS data of pure polymers, specific peaks with a certain
   molecular ion mass related to each polymer are determined. Using
   overlaid mappings on the surface of the blend by ToF-SIMS and selected
   ion masses to identify each polymer results in the differentiation of
   the various phases represented as a morphological image. In a second
   step, the multivariate curve resolution (MCR) method is used as a ``self
   modeling curve resolution{''} for the recovery of pure components from a
   multi-component mixture when little or no prior information is
   available. Total pseudo-color RGB images of PBS/PLA/PCL show that PIA
   droplets unambiguously partially wet the PBS and PCL phases. Since each
   pixel from the analysis in the high lateral resolution image represents
   a 200 nm diameter, the interfacial transitions can also be studied for
   both PLA/PBS and PLA/PCL interfaces. The results show the concentration
   variation of phases across the interfaces. A complete trace line across
   the two interfaces (PLA/PBS and PLA/PCL) allows for the quantitative
   determination of interfacial thickness for the first time for such
   systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To allow mobile node be always connected regardless of its location on
   the Internet, mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) is designed for next-generation
   wireless networks. However, this protocol has some inherent drawbacks:
   long handoff delay and high packet loss; unbearable for many
   applications. To improve the performance, mobility protocols such as
   Fast handovers for MIPv6 (FMIPv6), Fast handover for Hierarchical MIPv6
   (F-HMIPv6), Simplified Fast handover for MIPv6 networks (SFMIPv6), are
   proposed by researchers. But none of them can support seamless mobility.
   This paper proposes an enhanced fast handover protocol with seamless
   mobility supports, called enhanced Seamless MIPv6 (e-SMIPv6).
   Bidirectional tunnels are established among access routers before actual
   handover; accordingly mobile users can use their previous care-of
   address within a new visiting network. To reduce the delay related to
   duplicate address detection, each access router maintains a pool of
   duplicate-free addresses. To minimize packet loss, access router
   performs bicasting for roaming node. Our proposal can minimize mobility
   signaling as much as possible during handoff, which presents an ideal
   solution for fast moving and ping-pang moving mobile users. To analyze
   the performance, the city section mobility model is used. Of which
   numerical results show that e-SMIPv6 yields better performance than
   FMIPv6. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fractional crystallization and crystal segregation controlled by
   settling or floating of minerals during the cooling of magma can lead to
   layered structures in mafic and ultramafic intrusions in continental and
   oceanic settings in the lower crust. Thus, the seismic properties and
   fabrics of layered intrusions must be calibrated to gain insight into
   the origin of seismic reflections and anisotropy in the deep crust. To
   this end, we have measured P and S wave velocities and anisotropy in 17
   plagioclase-rich mafic igneous rocks such as anorthosite and gabbro at
   hydrostatic pressures up to 650MPa. Anorthosites and gabbroic
   anorthosites containing >80vol\% plagioclase and gabbros consisting of
   nearly equal modal contents of plagioclase and pyroxene display
   distinctive seismic anisotropy patterns: V-p(Z)/V-p(Y)1 and
   V-p(Z)/V-p(X)1 for anorthosites while 0.8<V-p(Z)/V-p(Y)1 and
   0.8<V-p(Z)/V-p(X)1 for gabbros. Amphibolites lie in the same domain as
   gabbros, but show a significantly stronger tendency of V-p(X)>V-p(Y)
   than the gabbros. Laminated anorthosites with V-p(X)approximate to
   V-p(Y)<<V-p(Z) display a strong crystal preferred orientation (CPO) of
   plagioclase whose (010) planes and {[}100] and {[}001] directions
   parallel to the foliation. For the gabbros and amphibolites
   characterized by V-p(X)approximate to V-p(Y)>V-p(Z) and
   V-p(X)>V-p(Y)>V-p(Z), respectively, pyroxene and amphibole play a
   dominant role over plagioclase in the formation of seismic anisotropy.
   The Poisson's ratio calculated using the average P and S wave velocities
   from the three principal propagation-polarization directions (X, Y, and
   Z) of a highly anisotropic anorthosite cannot represent the value of a
   true isotropic equivalent. The CPO-induced anisotropy enhances and
   decreases the foliation-normal incidence reflectivity at
   gabbro-peridotite and anorthosite-peridotite interfaces, respectively.}},

Title = {{Coupling between 3D displacements and rotations at the glenohumeral
   joint during dynamic tasks in healthy participants}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{29}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Glenohumeral displacements assessment would help to design
   shoulder prostheses with physiological arthrokinematics and to establish
   more biofidelic musculoskeletal models. Though displacements were
   documented during static tasks, there is little information on their 3D
   coupling with glenohumeral angle during dynamic tasks. Our objective was
   to characterize the 3D glenohumeral displacement-rotation couplings
   during dynamic arm elevations and rotations.
   Methods: Glenohumeral displacements were measured from trajectories of
   reflective markers fitted on intracortical pins inserted into the
   scapula and humerus. Bone geometry was recorded using CT-scan. Only four
   participants were recruited to the experiment due to its invasiveness.
   Participants performed dynamic arm abduction, flexion and axial
   rotations. Linear regressions were performed between glenohumeral
   displacements and rotations. The pin of the scapula of one participant
   moved, his data were removed from analysis, and results are based on
   three participants.
   Findings: The measurement error of glenohumeral kinematics was less than
   0.15 mm and 0.2 degrees. Maximum glenohumeral displacements were
   measured along the longitudinal direction and reached up to +12.4 mm for
   one participant. Significant couplings were reported especially between
   longitudinal displacement and rotation in abduction (adjusted R-2 up to
   0.94).
   Interpretation: The proposed method provides the potential to
   investigate glenohumeral kinematics during all kinds of movements. A
   linear increase of upward displacement during dynamic arm elevation was
   measured, which contrasts with results based on a series of static
   poses. The systematic investigation of glenohumeral displacements under
   dynamic condition may help to provide relevant recommendation for the
   design of shoulder prosthetic components and musculoskeletal models. (C)

Abstract = {{Developers might follow different file editing patterns when handling
   change requests. Existing research has warned the community about the
   potential negative impacts of some file editing patterns on software
   quality. However, very few studies have provided quantitative evidence
   to support these claims. In this paper, we propose four metrics to
   identify four file editing patterns: concurrent editing pattern,
   parallel editing pattern, extended editing pattern, and interrupted
   editing pattern. Our empirical study on three open source projects shows
   that 90\% (i.e. 1935 out of 2140) of files exhibit at least one file
   editing pattern. More specifically (1) files that are edited
   concurrently by many developers are 1.8 times more likely to experience
   future bugs than files that are not concurrently edited; (2) files
   edited in parallel with too many other files by the same developer are
   2.9 times more likely to exhibit future bugs than files individually
   edited; (3) files edited over an extended period of time are 1.9 times
   more likely to experience future bugs than other files; and (4) files
   edited with long interruptions have 2.0 times more future bugs than
   other files. We also observe that the likelihood of future bugs in files
   experiencing all the four file editing patterns is 3.9 times higher than
   in files that are never involved in any of the four patterns. We further
   investigate factors impacting the occurrence of these file editing
   patterns along three dimensions: the ownership of files, the type of
   change requests in which the files were involved, and the initial code
   quality of the files. Results show that a file with a major owner is 0.6
   times less likely to exhibit the concurrent editing pattern than files
   without major owners. Files with bad code quality (e.g. high McCabe's
   complexity, high coupling between objects, and lack of cohesion) are
   more likely to experience the four editing patterns. By ensuring a clear
   ownership and improving code quality, the negative impact of the four
   patterns could be reduced. Overall, our findings could be used by
   software development teams to warn developers about risky file editing
   patterns. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{E-plane out-of-phase junction is proposed for three-dimensional (3-D)
   substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) circuits and systems. Its
   fabrication is made with low-cost printed circuit board (PCB) process

   validated through the simulation and measurement of an experimental
   E-plane junction operating from 30 to 40 GHz (28\% bandwidth). Over this
   broadband frequency range, the fabricated prototype shows excellent
   performances with measured return loss, insertion loss and phase
   imbalance of better than 16 dB, 0.46 dB, and +/- 3 degrees,
   respectively. An integrated wideband dual-polarized array feed is
   designed and demonstrated on the basis of the proposed E-plane junction.
   The fabricated array achieves measured isolation of larger than 26 dB

Abstract = {{In this paper, we examine the problem of secondary access blocking in
   cognitive radio networks when secondary transmissions cause unacceptably
   high interference to primary transmissions. In general, the access of
   secondary users (SUs) to a licensed spectrum band is only allowed when
   this access does not alter the performance of primary users that can be
   defined by the primary QoS requirement. In this paper, we propose a
   cooperative scheme that allows SUs to increase their access to the
   spectrum band and access the spectrum even when the primary QoS is not
   satisfied. Using relay selection and a proper power allocation method,
   we show that the secondary outage performance can be significantly
   improved, whereas the primary outage performance is either not altered
   or slightly improved. Moreover, closed-form expressions of the primary
   and secondary outage probabilities are derived, and the achieved
   diversity order is calculated. Finally, analytical and simulation
   results illustrate the primary outage performance and secondary outage
   performance of the proposed scheme and show its advantages compared with
   conventional schemes.}},

Abstract = {{The reference node (RN) is a central node that has minimum distance/hop
   count to all other nodes in the network. This central node can play
   several critical roles such as being the time reference in order to
   synchronise computer nodes. For synchronisation, the main goal is to
   minimise the sum of synchronisation errors. The time synchronisation
   error, known for each link between two nodes, accumulates for each hop
   along the path used for synchronisation between two nodes. In such a
   context, the best RN is defined as having the minimal sum of time
   synchronisation errors between itself and every other node. Thus, the
   first step for error minimisation is to select a minimum spanning tree
   (MST), formed by the links with minimum synchronisation error, as
   synchronisation path. The second step is to select an RN, which
   minimises the sum of synchronisation errors to all nodes in the MST, as
   time reference for synchronisation. In a dynamic network, where
   communication links appear and disappear, and synchronisation accuracy
   improves as more packets are exchanged, a static RN would entail
   suboptimal synchronisation accuracy. All existing models in this area
   are limited to static RNs because of the computing cost of updating the
   RN, yielding a suboptimal total synchronisation error over time and
   causing problems if the selected node is removed from the dynamic
   network. This paper presents a novel and efficient method for dynamic RN
   selection in dynamic networks. The approach proposed in this paper
   improves the performance of RN computation and update in live mode for
   dynamic networks. This new method concentrates on the altered path with
   respect to the RN, each time the MST is updated. This provides an
   efficient way to find and maintain a RN incrementally in an average time
   complexity of O(log n) per update, which n is the total number of nodes
   in the network. The proposed approach was tested with a huge dynamic
   network containing 60000 simulated nodes, in a number of different
   situations. The proposed approach achieves excellent running time while
   minimising synchronisation error. Although this work is currently used
   for time synchronisation purposes, several dynamic network tools can
   benefit from an efficient incremental algorithm to calculate hop counts
   and select a central point for the network. Copyright (c) 2014 John

Abstract = {{We propose in this paper a novel configurable multi-power-rail pad that
   combines power supply support circuits and a digital input/output (I/O)
   buffers designed for a wafer-scale system. This wafer-scale platform
   includes a reconfigurable wafer-scale circuit, the WaferIC, comprising
   an alignment-insensitive surface that can be configured to interconnect
   any digital components manually deposited on its surface. The proposed
   multi-power-rail pad minimizes power losses and heat dissipation within
   the circuit. The pad that is fed from two distinct voltage sources
   providing power at 1.8 and 3.3 V has been implemented and tested. This
   pad has two merged configurable control loops that can select the power
   source. Merging takes place through shared transistors. This dual supply
   pad embeds a voltage regulator that achieves a fast response time of
   21.1 ns and that can operate over a wide range of configurable regulated
   output voltage, from 500 mV up to 2.955 V. This regulator is capable of
   providing a maximum output current of 40 mA while needing only a very
   small quiescent current of 126 mu A. The regulator's power supply noise
   rejection ranges from -25 down to -40 dB for frequencies ranging from 1
   kHz up to 1 MHz. The embedded digital I/O pad shares a common output
   with the power distribution and can be configured from 0.5 up to 3.3 V
   for a maximum speed of 250 MHz.}},

Abstract = {{In this review we evaluate recent experimental and theoretical progress
   in the development of wire-based waveguides used for practical low-loss
   and low-dispersion delivery of terahertz radiation. Waveguides
   considered in this review utilize plasmonic modes guided in the air gap
   between two parallel wires. The two parallel wires are, in turn,
   encapsulated inside of a low-loss, low-refractive-index micro- or
   nano-structured cladding that provides mechanical stability and
   isolation from the environment. We describe two alternative techniques
   that may be used to encapsulate the two-wire waveguides while minimizing
   the negative impact of dielectric cladding on the optical properties of
   the waveguide. The first technique uses low-density foam as a cladding
   material, while the other uses air-filled microstructured plastic
   claddings to support metallic wires. Additionally, we offer a detailed
   analysis of the modal properties of wire-based waveguides, compare them
   with the properties of a classic two-wire waveguide, and present several
   strategies for the improvement of hybrid waveguide performance. Using
   the resonant dependence of the confinement properties of some hybrid
   plasmonic modes also allows us to propose their use in terahertz
   refractometry. Finally, we demonstrate that wire-based porous waveguides
   can have a very large operational bandwidth while supporting tightly
   confined, air-bound modes at both high and low frequencies. This is
   possible as, at higher frequencies, hybrid fibers can support ARROW-like
   low-loss air-bound modes while changing their guidance mechanism to
   plasmonic confinement in the inter-wire air gap at lower frequencies.

Title = {{Calculation of self-field coefficients for 2D magnetostatic systems}},

Abstract = {{Physics and engineering students are introduced to the notion of a
   demagnetizing field in classical electromagnetism courses. This concept
   involves a formalism based on an integral formulation for calculating
   the coefficients of the demagnetizing tensor, i.e., a pure geometric
   quantity. For self-fields, the observation point is located inside the
   integration region which in turn leads to discontinuous integrands.
   Therefore, in order to avoid mathematical inconsistencies, special care
   must be taken when evaluating self-field coefficients, referred to here
   as self-terms. Given the complexity of this approach, in particular in
   3D, it is certainly interesting from a pedagogical stand point to employ
   2D systems as a first step for describing these kinds of coefficients.
   Thus, in this paper, the generalization of self-terms of the
   demagnetizing tensor is proven for 2D magnetostatic systems.
   Nonetheless, the structure of this proof pertains to many other
   situations given the fact that discontinuous integrands commonly arise
   in physics (e.g. integral solutions of PDEs which use a Green's
   function).}},

Abstract = {{Finding optimal/short-span Convolutional Self-Doubly Orthogonal (CDO)
   codes and Simplified-CDO (S-CDO) codes for a specified order J is
   computationally very challenging. This paper describes several
   optimizations that were applied to an implicitly-exhaustive search
   algorithm in order to reduce the time required for finding these types
   of codes. The resulting high-performance parallel implementation
   provides an impressive speedup that is greater than 16 300 (CDO, J - 7)
   and 6300 (S-CDO, J - 8) over the reference implicitly-exhaustive search
   algorithm, and greater than 2000 (J - 17) over the fastest published CDO
   validation function used in high-performance pseudorandom search
   algorithms. These speedups are achieved through enhancements in the
   deterministic search-space reduction, and a vastly improved validation
   function that makes use of a novel data structure for enabling
   data-reuse and incremental computations. The resulting validation
   function speedup is greater than 60 000 (S-CDO, J = 17) and 190 000
   (CDO, J = 17) when compared to its reference implementation. The
   combination of optimizations and load-balancing techniques allowed us to
   leverage hundreds of processor cores in order to complete an exhaustive
   search over a search space that is some 10(14) times larger than what
   was previously possible.}},

Title = {{Inversion of potential fields on nodes for large grids}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{110}},
Pages = {{90-97}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The non-iterative direct inversion of potential field data by stochastic
   approach enables to incorporate in a coherent way a priori geological
   knowledge, the known densities on any support size and the gravity data.
   The weakness of the method is the necessary computation of the parameter
   covariance matrix. For a large mesh made of prisms, the matrix is simply
   too large to fit in memory. The new approach approximates the prism
   covariance matrix by a surrogate matrix computed from the covariance
   matrix of a reduced set of nodes aimed at representing the whole domain
   of inversion. Care is taken to preserve the properties of direct
   stochastic inversion on the whole set of prisms. Hence, the approach
   accounts in a consistent way for the support effect, the inversion
   remains exact in the absence of noise on data, point and block known
   densities are exactly reproduced, any set of linear constraints can be
   applied, and the inversion is non-iterative in all cases. It is shown on
   synthetic examples that the number of nodes needs not to be very large
   to ensure a good approximation of the parameter covariance matrix or to
   ensure similarity of the inversion solutions. An application to a
   gravity survey including borehole density data shows the applicability
   of the method for a large number of cells in the inversion domain. Even
   with as much as 10,000 nodes and one million prisms, the computing time
   remained acceptable at less than two hours on a workstation. The
   inverted solution obtained with the nodes approach is compared to a
   direct kriging of borehole density data and to direct inversion using
   only the gravity data. The solution combining both information is
   different from the inversion using only gravity, but only in the area
   where borehole data are numerous. Although shown for the gravity-density
   potential, the approach is general and can be extended to
   magnetic-susceptibility and joint inversion. The proposed approach helps
   solving the recurrent problem of the application of stochastic inversion
   to large grids. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The hand-held Arthro-BST (TM) device is used to map
   electromechanical properties of articular cartilage. The purpose of the
   study was to evaluate correlation of electromechanical properties with
   histological, biochemical and biomechanical properties of cartilage.
   Method: Electromechanical properties (quantitative parameter (QP)) of
   eight human distal femurs were mapped manually ex vivo using the
   Arthro-BST (1 measure/site, 5 s/measure, 3209 sites). Osteochondral
   cores were then harvested from different areas on the femurs and
   assessed with the Mankin histological score. Prior to histoprocessing,
   cores were tested in unconfined compression. A subset of the cores was
   analyzed with polarized light microscopy (PLM) to assess collagen
   structure. Biochemical assays were done on additional cores to obtain
   water content and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content. The QP corresponding
   to each core was calculated by averaging all QPs collected within 6 mm
   of the core center.
   Results: The electromechanical QP correlated strongly with both the
   Mankin score and the PLM score (r = 0.73, P < 0.0001 and r = -0.70, P <
   0.0001 respectively) thus accurately reflecting tissue quality and
   collagen architecture. Electromechanical QP also correlated strongly
   with biomechanical properties including fibril modulus (r = -0.76, P <
   0.0001), matrix modulus (r = -0.69, P < 0.0001), and log of permeability
   (r = 0.72, P < 0.0001). The QP correlated weakly with GAG per wet weight
   and with water content (r = -0.50, P < 0.0003 and r = 0.39, P < 0.006
   respectively).
   Conclusion: Non-destructive electromechanical QP measurements correlate
   strongly with histological scores and biomechanical parameters providing
   a rapid and reliable assessment of articular cartilage quality. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The roadmap evolution and historical milestones of electromagnetic
   energy conversion techniques and related breakthroughs over the years
   are reviewed and presented with particular emphasis on low-density
   energy-harvest technologies. Electromagnetic sources responsible for the
   presence of ambient radio-frequency (RF) energy are examined and
   discussed. The effective use and recycling of such an ambient
   electromagnetic energy are the most relevant and critical issue for the
   current and future practicability of wireless energy-harvesting devices
   and systems. In this paper, a set of performance criteria and
   development considerations, required to meet the need of applications of
   ambient electromagnetic energy harvesting, are also derived from the
   radiating source analysis. The criteria can be calculated from a simple
   measurement of the I-V nonlinear behavior of RF rectification devices
   such as diodes and transistors, as well as linear frequency behavior
   (S-parameters). The existing rectifying devices are then reviewed in
   light of the defined performance criteria. Finally, a technological
   outlook of the performances that can be expected from different device
   technologies is assessed and discussed. Since the proposed spindiode
   technology would present the most promising device platform in the
   development of the most useful ambient energy harvesters, a special
   highlight of this disruptive scheme is provided in the presentation of

   improve its foamability. The steady and transient rheological properties
   of neat PLA and CE-treated PLA revealed that the introduction of the CE

   viscoelastic properties of CE-enriched PLA suggested that a long-chain
   branching (LCB) structure was formed from the reaction with the CE.
   LCB-PLA exhibited an increased viscosity, more shear sensitivity, and
   longer relaxation time in comparison with the linear PLA. The LCB
   structure was also found to affect the transient shear stress growth and
   elongational flow behavior. LCB-PLA exhibited a pronounced strain

   Batch foaming of the linear and LCB-PLAs was also examined at foaming

Abstract = {{In this study, rheological, crystal structure, barrier, and mechanical
   properties of polyamide 6 (PA6), poly(m-xylene adipamide) (MXD6) and
   their in situ polymerized nanocomposites with 4 wt \% clay were studied.
   The extent of intercalation and exfoliation as well as type of crystals,
   crystallinity, and thermal transitions were investigated using X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC),
   respectively. Dynamic rheological measurements revealed that
   incorporation of nanoclay significantly increases complex viscosity of
   MXD6 nanocomposites at low frequencies, which was related to the
   formation of a nanoclay network and exchange reaction between MXD6
   chains. The comparative study of dynamic characteristics (G' (omega) and
   G `' (omega)) for aliphatic and aromatic polyamide nanocomposites with
   their neat resins as well as the relaxation spectra for both polymer
   systems confirmed the possibility of the aforementioned phenomena.
   Although, the crystallinity of MXD6 films was lower as compared to PA6
   films, the permeability to oxygen was more than 5 times better for the
   former. Incorporating 4 wt\% clay enhanced the barrier property, tensile
   modulus, and yield stress of PA6 and MXD6 nanocomposite films in both
   machine and transverse directions without sacrificing much puncture and
   tear resistances. The PA6-based films showed higher tear and puncture
   strength as compared to MXD6 films. (C) 2013 Society of Plastics

Abstract = {{Rockfill is the most abundant building material. It is often used for
   water retention under different contexts, such as dams, embankments or
   drainage systems. Climate change may cause water levels to rise in
   reservoirs. As rockfill structures are not able to resist strong
   overtopping flow, rising water levels will constitute a danger for
   rockfill dam stability as well as for people living nearby. This work is
   aimed at the development of an empirical formula that enables
   calculation of the critical water level of overflow at the crest from
   the geometrical and physical parameters of a dam. To achieve these
   objectives, several experimental tests on a rockfill dam model with two
   different impervious cores, moraine with a sand filter and an empty
   wooden formwork, were conducted in a hydraulic channel at the
   hydro-environmental laboratory at Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal. The
   purpose of these tests was to study the initiation of a riprap failure
   under the influence of different variables, such as rock size, riprap
   bank, downstream side slope and bed slope. Results showed linear trends
   between the critical water level and both the downstream side slope and
   bed slope. Also, a power trend was observed between the critical level
   and riprap grain size. A formula that gives the critical overtopping
   water level was developed from these results.}},

Title = {{Recoverable robust single day aircraft maintenance routing problem}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& OPERATIONS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{130-145}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Aircraft maintenance planning is of critical importance to the safe and
   efficient operations of an airline. It is common to solve the aircraft
   routing and maintenance planning problems many months in advance, with
   the solution spanning multiple days. An unfortunate consequence of this
   approach is the possible infeasibility of the maintenance plan due to
   frequent perturbations occurring in operations. There is an emerging
   concept that focuses on the generation of aircraft routes for a single
   day to ensure maintenance coverage that night, alleviating the effects
   of schedule perturbations from preceding days. In this paper, we present
   a novel approach to ensure that a sufficient number of aircraft routes
   are provided each day so maintenance critical aircraft receive
   maintenance that night. By penalising the under supply of routes
   terminating at maintenance stations from each overnight airport, we
   construct a single day routing to provide the best possible maintenance
   plan. This single day aircraft maintenance routing problem (SDAMRP) is
   further protected from disruptions by applying the recoverable
   robustness framework. To efficiently solve the recoverable robust SDAMRP
   acceleration techniques, such as identifying Pareto-optimal cuts and a
   trust region approach, have been applied. The SDAMRP is evaluated
   against a set of flight schedules and the results demonstrate a
   significantly improved aircraft maintenance plan. Further, the results
   demonstrate the magnitude of recoverability improvement that is achieved
   by employing recoverable robustness to the SDAMRP. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Zooplankton has been shown to transport internalized pathogens
   throughout engineered drinking water systems. In this study,
   experimental measurements from GAC and SSF filtration tests using high
   influent concentrations of Cryptosporidium (1.3 x 10(6) and 3.3 x 10(4)
   oocysts L-1) and Giardia (4.8 x 10(4) cysts L-1) are presented and
   compared. A predation and transport conceptual model was developed to
   extrapolate these results to environmental conditions of typical
   (oo)cyst concentrations in surface water in order to predict
   concentrations of internalized (oo)cysts in filtered water. Pilot test
   results were used to estimate transport and survival ratios of
   internalized (oo)cysts following predation by rotifers in the filter
   beds. Preliminary indications of lower transport and survival ratios in
   SSF were found as compared with GAC filters. A probability of infection
   due to internalized (oo)cysts in filtered water was calculated under
   likeliest environmental conditions and under a worst-case scenario.
   Estimated risks under the likeliest environmental scenario were found to
   fall below the tolerable risk target of 10(-4) infections per person per
   year. A discussion is presented on the health significance of persistent
   pathogens that are internalized by zooplankton during granular
   filtration processes and released into treated water. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The availability of reliable and well-engineered commercial instruments
   and data analysis software has led to development in recent years of
   robust and ergonomic atom-probe tomographs. Indeed, atom-probe
   tomography (APT) is now being applied to a broader range of materials
   classes that involve highly important scientific and technological
   problems in materials science and engineering. Dual-beam focused-ion
   beam microscopy and its application to the fabrication of APT microtip
   specimens have dramatically improved the ability to probe a variety of
   systems. However, the sample preparation is still challenging especially
   for emerging nanomaterials such as epitaxial nanowires which typically
   grow vertically on a substrate through metal-catalyzed vapor phase
   epitaxy. The size, morphology, density, and sensitivity to radiation
   damage are the most influential parameters in the preparation of
   nanowire specimens for APT. In this paper, we describe a step-by-step
   process methodology to allow a precisely controlled, damage-free
   transfer of individual, short silicon nanowires onto atom probe
   microposts. Starting with a dense array of tiny nanowires and using
   focused ion beam, we employed a sequence of protective layers and
   markers to identify the nanowire to be transferred and probed while
   protecting it against Ga ions during lift-off processing and tip
   sharpening. Based on this approach, high-quality three-dimensional
   atom-by-atom maps of single aluminum-catalyzed silicon nanowires are
   obtained using a highly focused ultraviolet laser-assisted local
   electrode atom probe tomograph.}},

Abstract = {{The design of the appropriate material system for a given tribological
   application must be guided by an accurate understanding of the
   degradation mechanisms and the surface response to loading and
   deformation. In this review article, a detailed overview of the material
   loss mechanisms during solid particle erosion (SPE) which occurs when
   hard partides are entrained by an air flow and impact exposed surfaces
   will be presented. In the first part of the paper, several
   methodological considerations essential for the assessment of
   multi-parameter correlations necessary for the accurate interpretation
   of SPE data will be discussed. Then, the ductile and brittle SPE
   mechanisms, the transitions between these different material removal
   processes and the effect of particle properties on overall erosion
   behavior will be examined. Finally, in the last section of the paper,
   the various coating material systems proposed in the literature for
   protection against SPE are reviewed with a focus on the two main
   categories of TiN-based and carbon-based coatings. Concluding this
   review is a discussion on the effects of coating system microstructure
   and architecture on the SPE mechanisms of vapor deposited coatings. It
   will be shown that to significantly impact the future technological
   development of SPE protective coatings, novel highly resolved
   characterization methodologies need to be developed and employed. (C)

Abstract = {{A hyperspectral microscopy system based on a reflected light method for
   plasmonic nanoparticle (NP) imaging was designed and compared with a
   conventional darkfield method for spatial localization and spectroscopic
   identification of single Au, Ag and Au/Ag alloy NPs incubated with fixed
   human cancer cell preparations. A new synthesis protocol based on
   co-reduction of Au and Ag salts combined with the seeded growth
   technique was used for the fabrication of monodispersed alloy NPs with
   sizes ranging from 30 to 100 nm in diameter. We validated theoretically
   and experimentally the performance of 60 nm Au, Ag and Au/Ag (50 : 50)
   NPs as multiplexed biological chromatic markers for biomedical
   diagnostics and optical biosensing. The advantages of the proposed
   reflected light microscopy method are presented for NP imaging in a
   complex and highly diffusing medium such as a cellular environment. The
   obtained information is essential for the development of a high
   throughput, selective and efficient strategy for cancer detection and

Title = {{Partial order reduction for checking soundness of time workflow nets}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{282}},
Pages = {{261-276}},
Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{Due to the critical role of workflows in organizations, their design
   must be assisted by automatic formal verification approaches. The aim is
   to prove formally, before implementation, their correctness w.r.t. the
   required properties such as achieving safely the expected services
   (soundness property). In this perspective, time workflow nets (TWF-nets
   for short) are proposed as a framework to specify and verify the
   soundness of workflows. The verification process is based on state space
   abstractions and takes into account the time constraints of workflows.
   However, it suffers from the state explosion problem due the
   interleaving semantics of TWF-nets. To attenuate this problem, this
   paper investigates the combination of a state space abstraction with a
   partial order reduction technique. Firstly, it shows that to verify
   soundness of a TWF-net, it suffices to explore its non-equivalent firing
   sequences. Then, it establishes a selection procedure of the subset of
   transitions to explore from each abstract state and proves that it
   covers all its non-equivalent firing sequences. Finally, the
   effectiveness of the proposed approach is assessed by some experimental
   results (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Natural materials consisting of protein structures impregnated with a
   tiny amount of metals often exhibit impressive mechanical behavior,
   which represents a new design paradigm for the development of biomimetic
   materials. Here, we produced Al-infiltrated silks by applying a modified
   Al2O3 atomic layer deposition process to the dragline silk of the
   Nephila pilipes spider, which showed unusual mechanical properties. The
   deformation behavior of the molecular structure of the Al-infiltrated
   silk was investigated by performing in situ Raman spectroscopy, where
   Raman shifts were measured concurrently with macroscopic mechanical
   deformations. For identifying the role of the infiltrated Al atoms, the
   study was performed in parallel with untreated silk, and the results
   were compared. Our experimental results revealed that superior
   mechanical properties of the Al-infiltrated silk are likely to be caused
   by the alterations of the sizes of the beta-sheet crystals and their
   distribution.}},

   for in vivo imaging. The catheter performance is evaluated in
   tissue-mimicking phantoms. Simultaneous imaging with threemodalities is
   demonstrated at frame rates of 30 images per second for ultrasound and
   fluorescence and 1 image per 13 seconds for photoacoustic. Acquired
   radio-frequency ultrasound data could be processed to obtain radial
   strain elastograms. With motorized pullback, 3D imaging of phantoms was
   performed using the three modalities.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental concerns are increasingly taken into account by companies,

   This paper considers the environmental constraints inherent in the

   restrictions and for optimizing carbon emissions, given the need to
   limit costs in the current economic climate.
   A method is provided, along with accompanying graphical illustrations,
   to enable the analysis of each of the three parts of the cost and carbon
   emissions issue, that is, production, transportation, and component, on
   three different academic case studies.
   Analysis of the models applied on our case studies illustrates that,
   while optimizing carbon emissions is extremely costly, reducing them can

   triangular-ring slot (TRS) antennas are proposed for planar integration.
   First, a low profile dual band 45 degrees linearly polarized (LP)
   antenna is designed and analyzed. The dual-mode TRS is proposed and
   developed by simultaneously exciting the mode of the slot and the mode
   of the patch inside the slot. To minimize the antenna size, the lowest
   mode (TE110 mode) of the SIW cavity is adopted to excite the TRS. The -
   10 dB impedance bandwidth at the higher band is 5.9\%, 58.3\% wider than
   that of the conventional SIW cavity backed slot antenna. The
   interactions of the SIW cavity, the slot mode and the patch mode are
   analyzed with circuit models and verified by full wave simulations,
   which provides a new insight into the SIW cavity backed antennas. Then,
   by exciting a pair of the 45 degrees LP antennas with an SIW coupler, a
   circularly polarized (CP) dual band antenna with a small frequency ratio
   of 1.26 is developed. The two antennas are fabricated and tested, and
   the measured and simulated results agree well.}},

   systematically solve the well-known radiation degradation of P-LWAs at
   broadside, where it provides both open-stopband closure and efficiency
   equalization. The problem is addressed via a generic equivalent circuit
   model composed of a series resonator, a shunt resonator and ideal
   transformers for modeling asymmetry by a single and simple parameter,
   namely the transformation ratio. Once the series and shunt frequencies
   have been balanced (frequency-balancing), equalization is ensured by
   adjusting the degree of asymmetry in the unit cell so to match the
   at-broadside Bloch impedance to the off-broadside Bloch impedance. This
   equalization condition is referred to as quality factor balancing
   (Q-balancing) and it is related to the Heaviside condition
   (distortionless propagation) in homogeneous transmission lines. Based on
   this theory, optimization schemes for employing commercial fullwave
   eigenmode and drivenmode solvers are proposed to design unit cells with
   equalized efficiencies. Finally, two examples of P-LWAs are presented, a
   composite right/left-handed (CRLH) P-LWA and a series-fed coupled patch
   (SFCP) P-LWA, and verified to fully confirm the predictions of the
   theory obtained by circuit modeling.}},

Abstract = {{An anatomically detailed eighteen-rotational-degrees-of-freedom model of
   the human spine using optimization constrained to equilibrium and
   stability requirements is developed and used to simulate several
   symmetric tasks in upright and flexed standing postures. Predictions of
   this stability and kinematics-driven (S + KD) model for trunk muscle
   forces and spine compressive/shear loads are compared to those of our
   existing kinematics-driven (KD) model where both translational and
   rotational degrees-of-freedom are included but redundancy is resolved
   using equilibrium conditions alone. Unlike the KD model, the S + KD
   model predicted abdominal co-contractions that, in agreement with
   electromyography data, increased as lifting height increased at a
   constant horizontal moment arm. The S + KD model, however, could not
   fully explain the CNS strategy in activating antagonistic muscles for
   most of the remaining tasks. Despite quite distinct activities in
   individual muscles, both models predicted L4-L5 intradiscal pressure
   that matched the in vivo data, the L4-S1 compression loads, and the sum
   of all trunk muscle forces. For modeling applications in ergonomics,
   where the compressive spine loads are of interest, the two models
   yielded <15\% difference. In the field of rehabilitation, where detailed
   muscle forces are required, the S + KD model explained more properly the
   CNS strategy in activating the antagonistic muscles for some tasks. (C)

Abstract = {{The development of new molecular imaging techniques has bridged the gap
   between preclinical and clinical research. During the last decade, the
   developments in imaging strategies have taken a great leap by the
   advancements in new imaging scanners, development of pharmaceutical
   drugs, diagnostic agents, and new therapeutic regimens that made
   significant improvements in health care. The knowledge gained from
   imaging techniques in preclinical research can be applicable to the
   patients. Similarly, the problems from clinical studies with humans can
   be tested and studied in preclinical studies. The appropriate
   application of molecular imaging to drug discovery and development can
   markedly reduce costs and the time required for new drug development.
   Some imaging techniques, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI), reveal anatomical images, and single-photon
   emission computed tomography (SPECT), SPECT/positron emission tomography
   (PET), and PET show functional images. These developing molecular or
   neuroimaging methods provide increasingly detailed structural and
   functional information about the nervous system. The basic principles of
   each technique are described followed by examples of the current
   applications to cutting-edge neuroscience research. In summary, it is
   shown that neuroimaging continues to grow and evolve, embracing new
   technologies and advancing to address ever more complex and important

Abstract = {{The many-core design research community has shown high interest in
   optical crossbar on chip for more than a decade. Key properties of
   optical crossbars, namely (1) contention-free data routing, (2) low
   latency communication, and (3) potential for high bandwidth through the
   use of wavelength division multiplexing, motivate several
   implementations of this type of interconnect. These implementations
   demonstrate very different scalability and power efficiency abilities
   depending on three key design factors: (1) network topology, (2)
   considered layout, and (3) insertion losses induced by the fabrication
   process. In this paper, the worst-case optical losses of crossbar
   implementations are compared according to the factors mentioned earlier.
   The comparison results have the potential to help many-core system
   designer to select the most appropriate crossbar implementation
   according to, for instance, the number of IP cores and the die size.

Abstract = {{The thin flexible, lightweight nature of organic semiconductor devices
   makes them a prime candidate for medical imaging applications such as
   rugged X-ray imagers for use in hospitals (i.e., immune to minor drops

   modalities of the future (e.g., compression free breast imaging).
   However, the performance of these organic sensors is not yet comparable
   with current technology (amorphous silicon) in particular owing to high
   dark currents. Here we show that the use of an insulator material, such
   as polystyrene, can dramatically improve the dark current performance of
   the organic photoconductor without compromising the device speed.
   Consequently, we are able to operate the sensor under high bias to
   achieve significant improvements in the critical parameters for image
   sensors such as photo-to-dark current ratio, sensitivity, dynamic range,
   and transient speed. Our work has the potential to expedite the adoption

Abstract = {{High-voltage direct-current (HVDC) systems play an important role in
   modern energy grids, whereas efficient and accurate models are often
   needed for system-level studies. Due to the inherent switching in HVDC
   converters, the detailed switch-level models are computationally
   expensive for the simulation of large-signal transients and hard to
   linearize for small-signal frequency-domain characterization. In this
   paper, a dynamic average-value model (AVM) of the first CIGRE HVDC
   benchmark system is developed in a state-variable-based simulator, such
   as Matlab/Simulink, and nodal-analysis-based electromagnetic transient
   program (EMTP), such as PSCAD/EMTDC. The 12-pulse converters in the HVDC
   system are modeled with a set of nonlinear algebraic functions that are
   extracted numerically. The results from the average-value models are
   compared with the results of the detailed simulation to verify the
   accuracy of the AVMs in predicting the large-signal time-domain
   transients. The developed dynamic average models are shown to have
   computational advantages.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Tracing and monitoring tools, and other similar analysis tools, add new
   requirements to the old problem of coping with asynchronous clocks in
   distributed systems. Existing approaches based on the convex hull can
   achieve excellent accuracy for a posteriori analysis, but impose a
   significant cost and latency when used in live mode and over large
   clusters. We propose a novel method, LIANA (Live Incremental
   Asynchronous Network Analysis), for incrementally computing the clock
   offset, and updating it as the network evolves, along each communication
   link, as well as selecting the best synchronization paths and time
   reference node. Each connection in a network requires message exchanges
   to compute the clock skew and offset between two connected nodes. This
   method relies on the trace events recorded for the existing TCP/IP
   traffic between nodes. After computing the offset and its accuracy for
   every connection in the network graph, a minimum spanning tree is
   computed. The edges with the best accuracy are selected and form the
   spanning tree. Then, a central node is selected as the time reference to
   optimally compute the offset from any node to this reference node. LIANA
   is efficient, both in terms of synchronization accuracy and time
   complexity. The method, which is used for online distributed trace
   synchronization, has been evaluated in realistic scenarios with a
   diverse set of network topologies and traffic. We show that LIANA
   generates precise results highly efficiently, which makes it suitable
   for large cloud-distributed systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Development of a dynamic LCA approach for the freshwater ecotoxicity
   impact of metals and application to a case study regarding zinc
   fertilization}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT}},

Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Temporal variability is a major source of uncertainty in current life
   cycle assessment (LCA) practice. In this paper, the recently developed
   dynamic LCA approach is adapted to assess freshwater ecotoxicity impacts
   of metals. The objective is to provide relevant information regarding
   the distribution and magnitude of metal impacts over time and to show
   whether the dynamic approach significantly influences the conclusions of
   an LCA. An LCA of zinc fertilization in agriculture was therefore
   carried out.
   Dynamic LCA is based on the temporal disaggregation of the inventory,
   which is then assessed using time-horizon-dependent characterization
   factors. The USEtox multimedia fate model is used to develop
   time-horizon-dependent characterization factors for the freshwater
   ecotoxicity impact of 18 metals. Mass balance equations are solved
   dynamically to obtain fate factors as a function of time, providing both
   instantaneous (impact at time t following a pulse emission) and
   cumulative (total time-integrated impact following a pulse emission)
   characterization factors (CFs).
   Time-horizon-dependent CFs for freshwater ecotoxicity depend on the
   emission compartment and the metal itself. The two variables clearly
   influence metal fate aspects such as the maximum mass loading reaching
   freshwater and the persistence time of metals into this compartment. The
   time needed to reach the total impact for each metal may exceed
   thousands of years, so the time horizon used in the analysis constitutes
   a determining factor. The case study reveals that the results of a
   classical LCA are always higher than those obtained from a dynamic LCA,
   especially for short time horizons. For instance, at the end of a
   100-year fertilization treatment, only 25 \% of the impacts obtained
   through traditional LCA occurred.
   Results show that dynamic LCA enables assessing freshwater ecotoxicity
   impacts of metals over time, allowing decision makers to test the
   sensitivity of their results to the choice of a time horizon. For the
   particular case study of zinc fertilization over a period of 20 years,
   the use of time-horizon-dependent CFs is more important in determining
   the dynamics of impacts than the timing of emission.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1733-1741}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The estimation of overburden sediment thickness is important in
   hydrogeology, geotechnics and geophysics. Usually, thickness is known
   precisely at a few sparse borehole data. To improve precision of
   estimation, one useful complementary information is the known position
   of outcrops. One intuitive approach is to code the outcrops as zero
   thickness data. A problem with this approach is that the outcrops are
   preferentially observed compared to other thickness information. This
   introduces a strong bias in the thickness estimation that kriging is not
   able to remove. We consider a new approach to incorporate point or
   surface outcrop information based on the use of a non-stationary
   covariance model in kriging. The non-stationary model is defined so as
   to restrict the distance of influence of the outcrops. Within this
   distance of influence, covariance parameters are assumed simple regular
   functions of the distance to the nearest outcrop. Outside the distance
   of influence of the outcrops, the thickness covariance is assumed
   stationary. The distance of influence is obtained thru a
   cross-validation. Compared to kriging based on a stationary model with
   or without zero thickness at outcrop locations, the non-stationary model
   provides more precise estimation, especially at points close to an
   outcrop. Moreover, the thickness map obtained with the non-stationary
   covariance model is more realistic since it forces the estimates to zero
   close to outcrops without the bias incurred when outcrops are simply
   treated as zero thickness in a stationary model.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Flow-induced vibration in a steam generator may cause tube-support
   interaction. This long term interaction is a challenging problem as it
   may lead to tube fretting-wear and possibly tube failure. An estimation
   of the normal impact force during tube-support interaction is important
   to precisely quantify material removal. A precise study of the
   interaction presents several challenges as a result of the many
   parameters involved during the interaction, including fluid forces,
   number and type of supports, and geometry of contact. The present study
   investigates tube-support interaction using a simple experimental rig,
   consisting of a tube interacting with a flat support positioned at the
   tube midspan. The work investigates the normal force-displacement
   relationship and arrives at an estimation of empirical parameters,
   associated with the nonlinearity in this relationship. The resulting
   empirical model is used to simulate tube-support interaction for various
   gap sizes and excitation forces. Comparison with experiments indicates
   that using the nonlinear spring-damper model significantly reduces the
   predicted impact force error, to less than 20\%, when compared to
   experimental tests. Various energy dissipation mechanisms during
   tube-support interaction, including impact and structural damping are
   also studied. The effect of impact damping on the tube response is
   investigated, using the Hunt and Crossley model. Investigation on
   structural damping suggests that using a higher effective structural
   damping during tube-support contact, depending upon tube-support gap
   size, improves the accuracy of the estimation of the tube response, at
   least for moderate gap sizes.}},

Abstract = {{Controlling and manipulating liquid jets are of great interest in

   transverse uniform electric field on behaviour of liquid jet, streaming
   downward due to the gravity, is experimentally investigated in details

   applied electric field strength, authors have tried to study the
   interplay of electrical and hydrodynamic forces which are indeed the
   main factors acting on the jet behaviour e.g. deflection, rhythmic
   motion, breakup mechanism and satellite droplets formation. Major aim of
   this study is to manipulate liquid jet so as to attain uniformly sized
   droplets by removing satellite droplets which has potential applications
   in various industrial and laboratorial units. This procedure was
   performed by applying dielectrophoretic force to the water jet as a
   polar liquid. Furthermore the droplets and also satellites behaviour,
   influenced by transverse electric field, have been investigated

   number was varied from 1200 to 4800. The flow characteristics were
   analyzed through ensemble-averaged patterns of velocity, vorticity,
   normalized Reynolds stress contours and streamlines. Based on
   ensemble-averaged and instantaneous flow fields, different flow
   patterns, including single-wake-shedding at small spacing ratio,
   bi-stable flow behavior (alternating behavior of reattachment and vortex
   shedding) at intermediate spacing ratio and co-shedding pattern at large
   spacing ratio were observed. The effects of Reynolds number and the
   centre-to-centre spacing ratio on flow patterns and turbulent
   characteristics were also investigated. It was found that the diameter
   ratio appears to have a certain effect on the flow patterns at
   intermediate spacing ratios, where the reattachment of shear layer
   depends on the lateral width of the wake flow in the lee of the upstream
   cylinder. Extensive discussion on the distributions of Reynolds stress
   and turbulent kinetic energy was presented.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a paired cooperative reoptimization (PCR)
   strategy to solve the vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands
   (VRPSD). The strategy can realize reoptimization policy under
   cooperation between a pair of vehicles, and it can be applied in the
   multivehicle situation. The PCR repeatedly triggers communication and
   partitioning to update the vehicle assignments given real-time customer
   demands. We present a bilevel Markov decision process to model the
   coordination of a pair of vehicles under the PCR strategy. We also
   propose a heuristic that dynamically alters the visiting sequence and
   the vehicle assignment given updated information. We compare our
   approach with a recent cooperation strategy in the literature. The
   results reveal that our PCR strategy performs better, with a cost saving
   of around 20-30\%. Moreover, embedding communication can save an average
   of 1.22\%, and applying our partitioning method rather than an
   alternative can save an average of 3.96\%. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a state-of-the-art branch-cut-and-price algorithm
   for the vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands (VRPSD). We
   adapt the model of Christiansen and Lysgaard {[}6] and formulate the
   VRPSD as a set partitioning model with additional constraints. Feasible
   routes are generated using a dynamic programming algorithm executed over
   a state-space graph. Our method combines 2-cycle elimination with
   ng-routes. In addition, our pricing problem is significantly accelerated
   by the introduction of a new aggregate dominance rule. To speed up the
   generation of negative reduced cost columns, we use a tabu search
   heuristic and a bidirectional labeling algorithm. We also add capacity
   and subset-row inequalities dynamically in order to strengthen the
   linear relaxation of the master problem. As extensive computational
   tests illustrate, our algorithm is very competitive with the one of
   {[}6]. We solve 20 additional instances from the 40-instance set
   considered by these authors and we considerably improve the computing
   times for instances already closed. We also solve 17 new instances from

Abstract = {{We consider a real problem faced by a large company providing repair
   services of office machines in Santiago, Chile. In a typical day about
   twenty technicians visit seventy customers in a predefined service area
   in Santiago. We design optimal routes for technicians by considering
   travel times, soft time windows for technician arrival times at client
   locations, and fixed repair times. A branch-and-price algorithm was
   developed, using a constraint branching strategy proposed by Ryan and
   Foster along with constraint programming in the column generation phase.
   The column generation takes advantage of the fact that each technician
   can satisfy no more than five to six service requests per day. Different
   instances of the problem were solved to optimality in a reasonable
   computational time, and the results obtained compare favorably with the
   current practice. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new image-based visual servoing (IBVS) controller
   named augmented IBVS for a 6-DOF manipulator. The main idea of this
   controller is that it produces acceleration as the controlling command.
   A proportional-derivative controller is developed to provide the robot
   with the controlling command. This controller can achieve a smoother and
   more linear feature trajectory in the image space and decrease the risk
   that the features leave the field of view. The developed control method
   also enhances the camera trajectory in 3-D space. The stability of the
   proposed method is fully investigated by using the Lyapunov method and
   the perturbed systems theory. Experimental tests are performed on a
   6-DOF robotic system to validate the effectiveness of the proposed
   controller. The performance of the controller is compared with that of a
   conventional IBVS.}},

Abstract = {{A wide range of loading conditions involving external forces with
   varying magnitudes, orientations and locations are encountered in daily
   activities. Here we computed the effect on trunk biomechanics of changes
   in force location (two levels) and orientation (5 values) in 4 subjects
   in upright standing while maintaining identical external moment of 15
   Nm, 30 N m or 45 Nm at the L5-S1. Driven by measured kinematics and
   gravity/external loads, the finite element models yielded substantially
   different trunk neuromuscular response with moderate alterations (up to
   24\% under 45 Nm moment) in spinal loads as the load orientation varied.
   Under identical moments, compression and shear forces at the L5-S1 as
   well as forces in extensor thoracic muscles progressively decreased as
   orientation of external forces varied from downward gravity (90) all the
   way to upward (-25 degrees) orientation. In contrast, forces in local
   lumbar muscles followed reverse trends. Under larger horizontal forces
   at a lower elevation, lumbar muscles were much more active whereas
   extensor thoracic muscle forces were greater under smaller forces at a
   higher elevation. Despite such differences in activity pattern, the
   spinal forces remained nearly identical (< 6\% under 45 Nm moment). The
   published recorded surface EMG data of extensor muscles trend-wise
   agreed with computed local muscle forces as horizontal load elevation
   varied but were overall different from results in both local and global
   muscles when load orientation altered. Predictions demonstrate the
   marked effect of external force orientation and elevation on the trunk
   neuromuscular response and spinal forces and questions attempts to
   estimate spinal loads based only on consideration of moments at a spinal
   level. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{357}},
Pages = {{112-122}},
Month = {{SEP 21}},
Abstract = {{In this work, a kinetic-metabolic model previously developed for CHO
   cells is used to study glycolysis regulation. The model is assessed for
   its biological relevance by analyzing its ability to simulate metabolic
   events induced following a hypoxic perturbation. Feedback and
   feedforward regulatory mechanisms known to occur to either inhibit or
   activate fluxes of glycolysis, are implemented in various combined
   scenarios and their effects on the metabolic response were analyzed.
   This study aims at characterizing the role of intermediates of
   glycolysis and of the cell energetic state, described as the AMP-to-ATP
   ratio, as inhibitors and activators of glycolysis pathway. In addition
   to the glycolysis pathway, we here describe the transient metabolic
   response of pathways that are connected to glycolysis, such as the
   pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle, cell bioenergetics system,
   glutamine and amino acids metabolisms. Taken individually, each
   regulatory mechanism leads to an oscillatory behavior in response to a
   hypoxic perturbation, while their combination clearly damps
   oscillations. However, only the addition of the cell energetic state to
   the regulatory mechanisms results in a non-oscillating response leading
   to metabolic flux rate rearrangement corresponding to the anaerobic
   metabolism expected to prevail under hypoxic conditions. We thus
   demonstrate in this work, from model simulations, that the robustness of
   a cell energetic metabolism can be described from a combination of
   feedback and feedforward inhibition and activation regulatory mechanisms
   of glycolysis fluxes, involving intermediates of glycolysis and the cell
   energetic state itself. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A versatile velocity boundary condition treatment for the lattice
   Boltzmann method is proposed. The method can handle straight and curved
   boundaries, whether immersed or not. It is based on the streaming of
   equilibrium particle distributions emanating from ghost nodes. The
   fundamental idea is the location of these ghost nodes, specifically
   chosen on the lattice to avoid the evaluation of non equilibrium
   distributions. The methodology considers that the particle collision
   process time on the ghost nodes is proportional to the distance from the
   fluid nodes missing distributions. The linear nature of the BGK
   operator, which relaxes distributions exactly to their equilibrium state
   when the collision time is equal to the relaxation time, is also a key
   element. The method is compared to two other classical approaches for
   boundary condition treatment in the lattice Boltzmann method, on four
   test cases for which results are available in the scientific literature.
   Overall, the proposed method is second order accurate, and, when
   compared to the other two approaches, smaller errors were observed,
   especially for flows with a shorter relaxation time. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This letter reports the design, simulation, optimization, and optical
   characterization of an electro-optical SiO2-calcium barium niobate
   (CBN)-MgO rib waveguide structure. To achieve the single mode and low
   loss operation, the proposed rib waveguide structure is simulated and
   optimized with respect to CBN thin film thickness, etching depth, and
   rib width. Propagating optical mode profile of the waveguide is
   simulated using a beam propagation method solver. To verify the design
   and simulation, CBN thin film is coated on MgO substrate using a pulsed
   laser deposition technique, and SiO2-CBN-MgO is fabricated with various
   CBN thicknesses and rib widths. A smooth and nearly vertical etching of
   rib side wall enables the fabrication of high quality rib waveguides.
   The waveguides are characterized and measured wave profiles are compared
   with simulated results. It is found that the guided modes are well
   confined within the rib and extended through the core. An excellent
   agreement between simulations and measurements is observed, thereby
   validating the design method.}},

Abstract = {{Capabilities of the commercial finite element package ABAQUS in
   simulating frictionless contact between two saturated porous structures
   were evaluated and compared with those of an open source code, FEBio. In
   ABAQUS, both the default contact implementation and another algorithm
   based on an iterative approach requiring script programming were
   considered. Test simulations included a patch test of two cylindrical
   slabs in a gapless contact and confined compression conditions; a
   confined compression test of a porous cylindrical slab with a spherical
   porous indenter; and finally two unconfined compression tests of soft
   tissues mimicking diarthrodial joints. The patch test showed almost
   identical results for all algorithms. On the contrary, the confined and
   unconfined compression tests demonstrated large differences related to
   distinct physical and boundary conditions considered in each of the
   three contact algorithms investigated in this study. In general, contact
   with non-uniform gaps between fluid-filled porous structures could be
   effectively simulated with either ABAQUS or FEBio. The user should be
   aware of the parameter definitions, assumptions and limitations in each
   case, and take into consideration the physics and boundary conditions of
   the problem of interest when searching for the most appropriate model.}},

Abstract = {{There is a lack of early biomarkers of intervertebral disc (IVD)
   degeneration. Thus, the authors developed the analysis of magnetic
   resonance signal intensity distribution (AMRSID) method to analyse the
   3D distribution of the T2-weighted MR signal intensity within the IVD
   using normalised histograms, weighted centres and volume ratios. The
   objective was to assess the sensitivity of the AMRSID method to the
   segmentation process and data normalisation. Repetition of the
   semi-automatic segmentation by the same operator did not influence the
   quality of the contour or our new MR distribution parameters whereas the
   skills of the operator influenced only the MR distribution parameters,
   and the instructions given prior to the segmentation influenced both the
   quality of the contour and the MR distribution parameters. Bone
   normalisation produces an index that jointly highlights IVD and bone
   health, whereas cerebrospinal fluid normalisation only suppresses the
   effect of the acquisition gain. This robust AMRSID method has the
   potential to improve the diagnostic with earlier biomarkers and the
   prognosis of evolution.}},

Title = {{Comparison between pinch analysis and bridge analysis to retrofit the

Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Pinch analysis is based on the hot, cold and grand composite curves and
   is the most commonly-used approach to identify strategies for reducing
   energy consumption by heat exchanger network retrofit. This method was
   originally developed for the synthesis of new networks, and there remain
   certain difficulties for its application to improve existing networks.
   The advanced composite curves have been developed for retrofit
   situations specifically, and use data about existing heat exchangers to
   provide more information about the modifications necessary to achieve
   heat savings. Bridge analysis, which is based on the energy transfer
   diagram, is a new method and enumerates the sets of heat transfer
   modifications necessary to save energy. In this paper, the grand
   composite curve, the advanced composite curves and the energy transfer
   diagram have been constructed for analysis of the heat exchanger network
   of a kraft pulp mill. Links between these methods are made explicit;
   then results are discussed and compared. It is shown that the
   information provided by these approaches is consistent; however, the
   level of detail progressively increases from the grand composite curve
   to the advanced composite curves until the energy transfer diagram.
   Fundamentally, reducing the energy consumption implies decreasing the
   flow rate of heat cascaded through the network from the hot utility
   until the environment. As a consequence, any heat savings solution
   includes network modifications bridging coolers to heaters. Traditional
   pinch analysis does not provide information about the network
   modifications required after removal of cross pinch transfers, while the
   advanced composite curves indicate the heat savings potential attainable
   through modifications of few existing heat exchanger units. Bridge
   analysis provides more detail about heat savings modifications, which
   bridge existing heaters and coolers, than traditional pinch analysis and
   the advanced composite curves do. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{52}},

Abstract = {{In confined aquifers the influence of neighboring active wells is often
   neglected when interpreting a pumping test. This can, however, lead to
   an erroneous interpretation of the pumping test data. This article
   presents simple methods to evaluate the transmissivity tensor and
   storativity of an anisotropic confined aquifer when there is an
   interfering well in the neighborhood of the tested well. Two methods
   have been developed depending on whether the tested well or the
   interfering well is the first in operation. These new methods yield
   better estimates of the hydraulic parameters than when the influence of
   the interfering well is neglected. These methods have then been used on
   data obtained from numerical models with an interfering well and the
   results have been compared to an analytical method that neglects the
   influence of the interfering well. The methods require knowledge of the
   pumping rate of the interfering well and the time elapsed since the
   pumping started in each well. If the interfering well started pumping
   before the tested well, the method does not require knowledge of the
   aquifer piezometric level at the beginning of the test, which is often
   unknown in this case. As for the method without interference, at least
   three monitoring wells (MWs) are needed, the position of which
   influences the accuracy of the estimated parameters. Some
   recommendations concerning MWs position have been given to get more
   accurate results according to the sought parameter.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses noise and sensitivity issues in remote sensing and
   detection of vital signs based on a continuous wave biomedical radar
   operating at multiple harmonic carrier frequencies or channels. This
   Doppler radar makes use of a single mixer, taking advantage of the
   inherent nonlinearity and harmonic characteristics of the mixer. Other
   system building elements such as antennas, amplifiers, and circulators
   can also operate at and comply with multiple harmonic frequencies or
   channels requirements, which makes the system compact. Noise is one of
   the most important factors that affect the sensitivity of this type of
   system. The total noise is the combined contribution of thermal noise,
   residual phase noise, and flicker noise. Flicker noise is found to be
   the critical parameter for the baseband detection. Experimental results
   show that with the use of the harmonic radar technique, the flicker
   noise can be reduced by 20 dB around 1-Hz baseband frequency compared
   with the counterpart in a conventional radar operating at single
   frequency. The noise and sensitivity of a harmonic radar system
   operating at 12 and 24 GHz for vital signs detection are studied
   theoretically and experimentally. It is proven that the harmonic radar
   solution is able to increase detection sensitivity by increasing the
   signal-to-noise ratio. The performance of the harmonic radar is tested
   experimentally with a moving plate and also a real patient. For the
   heartbeat detection, an oximeter giving the oxygen saturation of blood
   and heart rate is used as the reference.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a low-power low-cost 45-GHz on-off keying (OOK)
   transceiver system in 90-nm CMOS for high-speed short-range wireless
   communications. The system includes a transmitter (Tx), a receiver (Rx),
   and two on-board substrate integrated waveguide fed Yagi-Uda antennas.
   The Tx provides about 7 dBm of output power and better than 50-dB on/off
   isolation while consuming 61.6 mW of dc power. The Rx performs
   noncoherent demodulation with a power consumption of 53.6 mW. The
   on-board antennas are integrated with the Tx and Rx using carefully
   designed broadband wire-bond interconnections, resulting in a low-cost
   system integration. The proposed transceiver achieves error-free
   operation (bit error rate 10) of 4-Gb/s data rate over a distance of 55
   cm, which results in a bit energy efficiency per distance (BEEPD) of
   0.52 pJ/bit/cm. To our best knowledge, this work shows the highest
   on/off isolation among the OOK Txs, the longest transmission distance,
   and the best BEEPD among the OOK transceivers reported to date in the
   millimeter-wave frequency band.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SANDWICH STRUCTURES \& MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the impact and compression after impact behavior of
   PVC foam cored/E-glass reinforced/vinylester sandwiches used in a
   four-seat amphibian aircraft. The impact damage was sorted in three
   categories: barely visible impact damage; visible impact damage; and
   clearly visible impact damage. It was observed that when increasing
   impact energy, the extension of the damage from barely visible impact
   damage to visible impact damage corresponds to a significantly high rate
   of energy absorption as depicted by the absorbed energy/impact energy
   ratio. Sandwich coupons were modeled with the finite element analysis
   ANSYS software to predict the critical failure load in presence of
   damage zones equivalent to those observed experimentally. The finite
   element model predicts consistently the compression after impact
   strength of undamaged coupons and this result confirms the model used to
   represent the woven fabric by an equivalent cross-ply laminate model.
   However, the finite element overestimates the compression after impact
   strength of impacted ones. It is suggested that the induced out-of-plane
   displacements generate stress concentrations in the tip of cracks
   located at the borders of the damaged zone.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an exact algorithm for solving a two-dimensional
   orthogonal packing problem with unloading constraints, which occurs as a
   subproblem of mixed vehicle routing and loading problems. The packing
   considered in this work is basically a feasibility problem involving a
   single bin. The problem is addressed through a decomposition approach
   wherein a branch-and-cut algorithm is designed for solving a
   one-dimensional relaxation of the original problem. When an integer
   solution is found in the branching tree, a subsidiary problem is solved
   to identify a two-dimensional packing that does not lead to any overlap
   and satisfies the unloading constraints. Cuts are added when the
   subsidiary problem proves to be infeasible. Several preprocessing
   techniques aimed at reducing the size of the solution space and
   uncovering infeasibility are also described. A numerical comparison with
   the best known exact method is reported at the end based on benchmark
   instances.}},

Abstract = {{The construction of waste rock inclusions (WRIs) in a tailings
   impoundment constitutes an alternative disposal technique that aims at
   improving the management of mine wastes. This technique consists in
   strategically placing the WRIs inside the impoundment, at the beginning
   and during its operation, to form compartments (or cells) in which the
   tailings are stored. Such inclusions can serve various purposes. In this
   paper, the authors investigate the effects of drainage from WRIs on
   tailings consolidation during filling of the impoundment, using
   experimental data from hard rock mines that provide the hydrogeological
   and geotechnical properties introduced in the numerical analyses. The
   model used for the simulations represents a cross section of a portion
   of a tailings impoundment containing a WRI. The numerical calculations
   results illustrate how the WRI affects the dissipation of the excess
   pore water pressures (PWPs) during filling of the impoundment, and help
   quantify the extent of the zone of influence of the inclusion. The
   results from the parametric analysis show that the saturated hydraulic
   conductivity k(sat), compression index C-c, thickness, and deposition
   rate of the tailings are the main factors that affect the efficiency of
   WRIs to accelerate dissipation of excess PWPs. The discussion that
   follows recalls the main limitations of this investigation and addresses
   practical aspects related to the WRIs technique.}},

Abstract = {{Given the emergence of innovative processes in recent years for the
   manufacture of bioproducts from second-generation biomass, a range of
   unique biorefinery strategies are likely to be implemented by forest
   product companies in the coming years. No matter what biorefinery
   strategy is employed, to compete in the longer term, it will be critical
   to have a supply-chain adapted to the targeted products. In order to
   meet customer needs and at the same time be cost-competitive, there are
   trade-offs to be made between responsiveness and efficiency in several
   areas of the supply chain, such as production and customer service. This
   paper reviews supply-chain characteristics and competitive factors for
   various bioproducts. An approach that can be used by decision-makers
   during early-stage design is presented, suitable for screening-out less
   promising options based on their supply-chain characteristics.
   Fundamental aspects such as the differentiation of products, their
   possible green advantage, biomass procurement, and process
   characteristics are discussed within five categories: bioenergy,
   biofuels, commodity biochemicals, fine and specialty biochemicals, and
   biomaterials. Several examples of biorefinery strategies are discussed
   to illustrate these concepts. (C) 2014 Society of Chemical Industry and

   imbalance series capacitive compensation concept that was introduced in
   the 1990s as a subsynchronous resonance countermeasure on SSI damping.
   The validity and effectiveness of the proposed methods are demonstrated

Abstract = {{This paper presents a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for the
   assessment of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) from chest
   radiographs. Our method consists in automatically extracting intercostal
   patches from chest radiographs belonging to the test database using a
   semiautomatic segmentation method of the ribs. Statistical and spectral
   features are computed from each patch then a method of feature
   transformation is applied using the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).
   A training database of 321 patches was classified by an expert in two
   classes, a class of normal patches and a class of abnormal patches.
   Patches belonging to the test database are then classified using the SVM
   classifier. Finally, the rate of abnormal patches is calculated for each
   quadrant to decide if the chest radiograph presents an ARDS. The method
   has been evaluated on 90 radiographs where 53 images present ARDS. The
   results show a sensitivity of 90.6\% at a specificity of 86.5\%. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper proposes and presents a class of substrate integrated
   waveguide (SIW) power dividers/combiners based on a modified Wilkinson
   architecture. The proposed design consists of a ring-type circuit of 1.5
   lambda g length with three waveguide ports. Impedance variation without
   affecting cutoff frequency and integration of isolation resistance are
   the two major limitations in connection with the design of SIW Wilkinson
   structures. Central ring part with different thickness ensures different
   impedance in the first proposed scheme while the half-mode SIW in the
   second option. As for the second limitation, the optimal configuration
   of integrating the isolation resistance is studied. A version without
   resistance is also examined using a broad-wall series slot. To validate
   the proposed concept, a bilayered circuit with standard Printed circuit
   board prototype was fabricated and measured. A table summarizing
   performances of all the proposed circuits shows a bandwidth of around
   25\% at the 10 dB reference. A negligible additional insertion loss is
   observed. The proposed design techniques are found useful at
   millimeter-wave frequencies where reduced physical dimensions make a
   circuit configuration suitable for low-cost implementation. This concept
   is also valid for rectangular waveguide counterparts.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We propose using THz frequency selective surfaces interrogated with THz
   subwavelength optical fibers as integrated sensors for monitoring of the
   optical properties of thick optically non-transparent films that are
   brought into contact with such sensors. Changes in the test film
   thickness and absorption losses can be measured simultaneously by
   interpreting variations in the spectral resonant features in the fiber
   transmission and reflection spectra. In particular, changes in the film
   thickness induce strong shifts in the fiber transmission peaks, while
   changes in the film absorption induce notable amplitude variations in
   the fiber reflection peaks. When applied to the problem of monitoring
   the thickness and humidity content of paper sheets, the proposed system
   shows a sensitivity of 1.5 GHz/10 mu m to changes in the paper's
   thickness and a sensitivity of 0.6/(\% of water by volume) to changes in
   the paper's humidity. We estimate the detection limit of our device to
   be 10 mu m for the paper thickness variation and 0.02\% (of water by
   volume) for the paper humidity variation. The proposed sensor is
   implemented in the spirit of integrated optics, where a point device
   based on the frequency selective surface is interrogated with a THz
   fiber that is used for remote delivery of THz radiation.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes the problem in which the edges of a network
   represent customers, and a quantity of material is delivered to them so
   that each one achieves a desired inventory level while finding the
   lowest-cost route of delivery. Routing and inventory decisions are made
   at the same time. An example of an application of this problem is dust
   suppression in open-pit mines. A fleet of trucks spray water along the
   roads of a mine. Humidity increases the effectiveness of dust-particle
   retention. Because the level of humidity decreases, replenishment is
   done periodically. Other examples of applications include dust
   suppression in forest roads and plants watering in street medians and
   sidewalks. We develop a mathematical model that combines two objectives:
   An inventory objective that minimizes the penalty for the lack of
   humidity and a routing objective that minimizes watering and traversing
   costs. Due to the complexity of the mathematical model, we developed an
   adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm that combines several
   destroy and repair operators dynamically. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{Porous structures destined for tissue engineering applications should
   ideally show controlled and narrow pore size distributions with fully
   interconnected pores. This study focuses on the development of novel
   poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) structures with fully connected pores
   of 84, 116, 141, and 162 mu m average diameter, from melt blending of
   PCL with poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) at the co-continuous composition,
   followed by static annealing and selective extraction of PEO. Our
   results demonstrate a low onset concentration for PEO continuity and a
   broad region of phase inversion. A novel in vitro assay was used to
   compare scaffold infiltration by 10-mu m diameter polystyrene beads
   intended to mimic trypsinized human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs).
   Beads showed a linear increase in the extent of scaffold infiltration
   with increasing pore size, whereas BMSCs infiltrated 162 and 141 mu m
   pores, below which the cells aggregated and adhered near the seeding
   area with low infiltration into the porous device. While providing a
   baseline for non-aggregated systems, the beads closely mimic trypsinized
   cells at pore sizes equal to or larger than 141 mu m, where optimal
   retention and distribution of hBMSCs are detected. A cytotoxicity assay
   using L929 cells showed that these scaffolds were cytocompatible and no
   cell necrosis was detected. This study shows that a melt blending
   approach produces porous PCL scaffolds of highly controlled pore size,
   narrow size distribution and complete interconnectivity, while the bead
   model system reveals the baseline potential for a homogeneous,
   non-aggregated distribution of hBMSCs at all penetration depths.}},

Abstract = {{This in vivo study aimed at investigating the effects of dynamic
   compression on the growth plate. Rats (28 days old) were divided into
   three dynamically loaded groups, compared with two groups (control,
   sham). A device was implanted on the 6th and 8th caudal vertebrae for 15
   days. Controls (n = 4) did not undergo surgery. Shams (n 4) were
   operated but not loaded. Dynamic groups had sinusoidal compression with
   a mean value of 0.2 MPa: 1.0 Hz and +/- 0.06MPa (group a, n 4); 0.1 Hz
   and +/- 0.2MPa (group b, n = 4); 1.0 Hz and + 0.14MPa (group c, n 3).
   Growth rates (mm/day) of dynamic groups (a) and (b) were lower than
   shams (p < 0.01). Growth plate heights, hypertrophic cell heights and
   proliferative cell counts per column did not change in dynamic (a) and
   (b) groups compared with shams (p > 0.01). Rats from dynamic group (c)
   had repeated inflammations damaging tissues; consequently, their
   analysis was unachievable. Increasing magnitude or frequency leads to
   growth reduction without histomorphometric changes. However, the
   combined augmentation of magnitude and frequency alter drastically
   growth plate integrity. Appropriate loading parameters could be
   leveraged for developing novel growth modulation implants to treat
   skeletal deformities. (C) 2014 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published

Abstract = {{Bulk nanocomposites of (Bi0.2Sb0.8)(2)Te-3 and

   are observed to decorate the grain boundaries of the matrix, leading to
   a significant reduction of average grain size and crystallite size
   compared to those of the conventional single phase alloy. Consequently,
   the thermal conductivity of these nanocomposites also decreases (similar

   conventional alloy (similar to 1.8 W/m.K). The structural changes in the

   a systematic reduction of its activation energy with an increase in MoS2

Abstract = {{This article tackles the multi-trip vehicle routing problem with time
   windows and limited duration. A trip is a timed route such that a
   succession of trips can be assigned to one vehicle. We provide an exact
   two-phase algorithm to solve it. The first phase enumerates possible
   ordered lists of clients which match the maximum trip duration
   criterion. The second phase uses a Branch and Price scheme to generate
   and choose a best set of trips so that all customers are visited. We
   propose a set covering formulation as the column generation master
   problem, where columns (variables) represent trips. The sub-problem
   selects appropriate timing for trips and has a pseudo-polynomial
   complexity. Computational results on Solomon's benchmarks are presented.
   The computational times obtained with our new algorithm are much lower
   than the ones recently obtained in the only two studies published on
   this problem to date.}},

Abstract = {{The jiggled bed reactor (JBR) is a state-of-the-art batch fluidized
   microreactor designed and developed to test catalysts for endothermic
   reactions. The solid particles in the microreactor are mechanically
   fluidized by agitating the reactor using a linear pneumatic actuator. An
   external induction field heats up vertical metal wires installed inside
   the reactor bed to generate heat rapidly and uniformly within the bed of
   solid particles, while eliminating hot spots and large temperature
   gradients. Image and signal processing techniques were utilized to
   investigate how the fluidization dynamics of the solid particles are
   affected by the amplitude and frequency of the vibrations, and the size
   distribution and the mass of the particles. The results show that the
   microreactor is very flexible: operating conditions can be optimized to
   successfully fluidize any type of catalyst. Heat-transfer coefficients
   between heating surfaces and the bed are similar to the coefficients
   that could be obtained in a well-bubbling fluidized bed. This confirms
   the excellent quality of the fluidization achieved with the new JBR. (C)

   The modified quasichemical model, which takes short-range ordering into

   are treated as stoichiometric compounds. A set of self-consistent model
   parameters is obtained and the experimental data are reproduced well
   within experimental error limits. The enthalpy of mixing, entropy of
   mixing, and activity of element are calculated, showing the liquid phase
   exhibits maximum short-range ordering at 75 at\% X (X=Li, Na, K, Rb).
   Some systematic variations and regularities are presented, indicating
   the enthalpy and entropy of mixing for the liquid phase at the maximum
   short-range ordering along with the enthalpy of formation and melting

   (wurtzite) CdSe NCs with an average size of 10 nm were obtained via this
   new route. The obtained CdSe NCs were treated individually with pyridine
   and tert-butylamine (t-BA) for ligand exchange. Fourier transform
   infrared spectra of the as-synthesized and treated CdSe NCs confirmed
   the removal of OA ligands from the surface of CdSe NCs after treatments
   with pyridine and t-BA. Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell devices

   poly (3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) polymer. BHJ solar cell devices
   made from P3HT:(surface treated CdSe NCs) blends showed greater
   improvement in photovoltaic performances compared to P3HT:(untreated

Abstract = {{This paper presents an identification procedure based on the Virtual
   Fields Method (VFM) for identifying in situ mechanical properties of
   composite materials constitutive phases from 3D full-field measurements.
   The new procedure, called the Regularized Virtual Fields Method (RVFM),
   improves the accuracy of the VFM thanks to the imposition of mechanical
   constraints derived from an appropriate homogenization model. The
   developed algorithms were validated through virtual experiments on
   particulate composites. The robustness of both the VFM and the RVFM was
   assessed in the presence of noisy strain data for various
   microstructures. A study was also carried out to investigate the
   influence of the size of region of interests on the reliability of the
   identified parameters. Accordingly, the optimum size of region of
   interest was determined based on full-field measurement requirements and
   accuracy of the identified parameters. This study enables determining, a
   priori, the required magnification level of 3D images for composites of
   any mechanical and morphological characteristics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{The influence of structural order on the electronic and optical
   properties of C-60/P3HT bulk heterojunctions (BHJs) was studied using
   first principles DFT and TDDFT methods. The electronic levels alignment
   between the two phases in the BHJs is mainly controlled by the
   interfacial dipole moment that shifts the P3HT electronic levels towards
   higher binding energies with respect to C-60 levels. An increasing order
   translates into an increasing P3HT domains size, for which we considered
   different stacks of P3HT oligomers. A significant decrease of both the
   electronic (HOMOP3HT-LUMOC60) and the optical (HOMOP3HT-LUMOP3HT) band
   gap is observed with an increasing P3HT domain size. TDDFT approach was
   used to identify the orbitals involved in the electronic transitions,
   and to reveal that the reduction of the BHJ optical band gap cannot
   simply be predicted from the variation of the rrP3HT band gap. The
   lowest electronic transition in rrP3HT becomes optically forbidden due
   to the formation of H-aggregates. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{204-217}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Context: Many engineering problems require to solve PDE on deforming
   domains to account for the temporal evolution of the domain boundaries.
   Fluid-Structure Interaction problems and free-surface flows solved by a
   front-tracking approach are two such examples.
   Objective: In this paper, we address the numerical solution of the
   three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations on deforming domains using the
   finite-element (FE) method and an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE)
   formulation.
   Method: The proposed formulation incorporates the ALE mapping into the
   finite-element method in a natural and straightforward manner. It allows
   the use of any time integrator that can be expressed as a
   finite-difference in time and maintains the integrators fixed grid
   convergence rate on ALE deforming grids. Hence, popular time integrators
   (implicit backward Euler, Gear, BDF, Runge-Kutta, etc.) can be applied
   directly to moving grid simulations without necessitating any
   modification or adjustment to the code.
   Results: Using a manufactured solution, we present thorough time
   stepsize refinement studies. Results are reported for two families of
   time-stepping procedures: the implicit Backward Differentiation Formulas
   (multi-step methods of order 1-5) and the Implicit (Radau IIA)
   Runge-Kutta methods (one-step methods of order 1,3 and 5).
   Conclusion: The proposed FE/ALE formulation preserves the fixed-grid
   orders of accuracy of time-stepping procedures on 3D moving grids.
   Hence, three-dimensional FE/ALE simulations can be performed with highly
   accurate time integrators. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   assessment: A case study of renewable distributed generation}},
Journal = {{RENEWABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Electricity supply is frequently cited as a significant hot spot in life
   cycle assessment (LCA) results. Despite its importance, however, LCA
   research continues to overuse simplified methodologies regarding
   electricity supply modeling. This work aims to demonstrate the
   usefulness of electricity trade analysis (proposed model) for
   integrating the short-term dynamics of electricity supply and refining
   LCA results. Distributed generation using renewable energy is applied as
   a case study to demonstrate how electricity trade analysis provides more
   refined estimates when environmental impact abatements are assessed
   compared with the conventional (simplified) approaches in LCA.
   Grid-connected photovoltaic panel (3 kWp mono- and poly-crystalline) and
   micro-wind turbine (1, 10 and 30 kW) environmental impact abatements are
   investigated by determining the displaced marginal electricity
   production on an hourly basis. The results indicate that environmental
   impact abatements calculated using the developed short-term time horizon
   approach can be significantly different (up to 200\% difference) from
   those obtained using a simplified approach. Recommendations are provided
   to LCA practitioners to address this issue of differing results. (C)

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{66}},
Pages = {{39-46}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The fatigue crack growth behavior of a CA6NM weld heat affected zone
   (HAZ) was investigated. Fatigue crack growth tests in river water
   environment were conducted on as-welded and post-weld heat treated
   specimens at load ratios R = 0.1 and R = 0.7. For a fully open crack,
   i.e. at R = 0.7, the HAZ fatigue behavior was similar to that of the
   base metal. When crack closure occurred, i.e. at R = 0.1, the HAZ showed
   a lower near threshold crack growth resistance. The post-weld heat
   treatment was beneficial at R = 0.1 by relieving tensile residual
   stresses, while its effect was negligible at R = 0.7. The crack
   trajectory was influenced by the weld's yield strength mismatch which
   promoted deviation towards the soft material (base metal). The main
   conclusion of this study is that the HAZ does not represent a weak link
   when its high load ratio fatigue behavior is considered. This confirms
   the validity of currently used fatigue assessment methods of hydraulic
   turbine runners. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to control voluntary weight shifting is crucial in many
   functional tasks. To our knowledge, weight shifting ability in response
   to a visual stimulus has never been evaluated in children with cerebral
   palsy (CP). The aim of the study was (1) to propose a new method to
   assess visually guided medio-lateral (M/L) weight shifting ability and
   (2) to compare weight-shifting ability in children with CP and typically
   developing (TD) children. Ten children with spastic diplegic CP (Gross
   Motor Function Classification System level I and II; age 7-12 years) and
   10 TD age-matched children were tested. Participants played with the
   skiing game on the Wii Fit game console. Center of pressure (COP)
   displacements, trunk and lower-limb movements were recorded during the
   last virtual slalom. Maximal isometric lower limb strength and postural
   control during quiet standing were also assessed. Lower-limb muscle
   strength was reduced in children with CP compared to TD children and
   postural control during quiet standing was impaired in children with CP.
   As expected, the skiing game mainly resulted in M/L COP displacements.
   Children with CP showed lower M/L COP range and velocity as compared to
   TD children but larger trunk movements. Trunk and lower extremity
   movements were less in phase in children with CP compared to TO
   children. Commercially available active video games can be used to
   assess visually guided weight shifting ability. Children with spastic
   diplegic CP showed impaired visually guided weight shifting which can be
   explained by non-optimal coordination of postural movement and reduced
   muscular strength. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, one-dimensional (1D) and 2D scan phased array antennas for
   60 GHz radio communication and radar sensing systems are proposed,
   studied and experimentally validated in the substrate-integrated
   waveguide technology. A linearly polarised phased array with 1D scanned
   beams in the first part of this study and a right-hand circularly
   polarised (CP) array with 2D scanned beams in the second part are
   presented and discussed in detail. In the demonstrated 1D phased array,
   dielectric rod antenna is used as radiating elements to form 1 x 4
   linear array and then a planar Butler matrix is integrated along with
   the array to obtain phase-steered beams. In the 2D phased array, CP
   radiating elements are used to form 2 x 4 array and then a folded Butler
   matrix is used to feed the CP array. Simulated and measured
   characteristics of these two phased array antenna radiation parameters
   are compared. The proposed phased arrays can be integrated into 60 GHz
   and other millimetre-wave radar and radio systems as an integrated
   antenna front-end.}},

Abstract = {{The optimization of heat-sealing process parameters, including time,
   temperature, and pressure, was performed on a monolayer linear
   low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) film. The seal properties examined for
   each process condition were: seal initiation temperature (T-si), plateau
   initiation temperature (T-pi), final plateau temperature (T-pf), plateau
   seal strength (SSp), and failure mode. Increasing dwell time enhanced
   seal strength. However, it was found that the rate of this enhancement
   is different for each interval of dwell time. A narrow temperature
   plateau was observed for dwell times lower than 0.4 s and higher than 2
   s, while in between a broad temperature window was observed. The
   pressure shows its influence up to the stage of wetting. And after
   providing the intimate contact between two film layers, additional
   increase in pressure does not enhance seal strength significantly. A 3D
   mapping of process safety zone was introduced for seal strength in the
   range of heat seal process variables for the very first time. The
   analysis of this 3D representation revealed that seal strength has a
   linear correlation with the square root of dwell time. In addition, the
   interfacial bond strength was shown to be proportional to the fraction
   of melted crystals. It was found that this fraction is determined by
   dwell time and temperature. Topography and morphology of surfaces after
   peeling revealed enlargement of fibrillar morphology to taller failure
   fracture complex shapes. Extensive roughness analysis on film surfaces
   after peeling found the much rougher surfaces after breakage of strong
   bonding.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicle routing variants with multiple depots and mixed fleet present
   intricate combinatorial aspects related to sequencing choices, vehicle
   type choices, depot choices, and depots positioning. This paper
   introduces a dynamic programming methodology for efficiently evaluating
   compound neighborhoods combining sequence-based moves with an optimal
   choice of vehicle and depot, and an optimal determination of the first
   customer to be visited in the route, called rotation. The assignment
   choices, making the richness of the problem, are thus no more addressed
   in the solution structure, but implicitly determined during each move
   evaluation. Two meta-heuristics relying on these concepts, an iterated
   local search and a hybrid genetic algorithm, are presented. Extensive
   computational experiments demonstrate the remarkable performance of
   these methods on classic benchmark instances for multi-depot vehicle
   routing problems with and without fleet mix, as well as the notable
   contribution of the implicit depot choice and positioning methods to the
   search performance. New state-of-the-art results are obtained for
   multidepot vehicle routing problems (MDVRP), and multidepot vehicle
   fleet mix problems (MDVFMP) with unconstrained fleet size. The proposed
   concepts are fairly general, and widely applicable to many other vehicle
   routing variants. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new material parameters identification method
   based on the Virtual Fields Method (VFM) where a regularization term
   coming from a micromechanical model has been added. In this Regularized
   Virtual Fields Method (RVFM), the system of equations associated to the
   VFM is solved within a constrained optimization framework. The method
   was applied to virtual Scanning Electron Microscope in-situ tests aiming
   at determining the local properties of uni-directional composites loaded
   in the transverse direction and for which the strain fields were
   obtained through Digital Image Correlation (DIC). The method was tested
   for composites with various volume fractions and properties contrasts
   and under different boundary conditions. The potentials and limitations
   of the algorithm in the presence of noisy images were investigated and
   compared to that of the VFM and the other finite element based methods.
   The corresponding results indicate that the proposed RVFM is more
   efficient than the other identification techniques in terms of both
   accuracy and computational time. An optimum size of region of interest
   was also determined by taking into account DIC magnification
   requirements and based on the accuracy of the identified parameters.
   This kind of study can be very useful for determining, a priori, the
   level of resolution in the imaging system required for a favorable
   accuracy of the identified parameters. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Polypropylene nanocomposite materials were prepared with 5 and 10 wt \%

   followed by FTIR spectroscopy and determined by titration. The increase
   in modulus of the obtained PP/Clay nanocomposites was attributed to the
   greater dispersion level, presumably achieved becuase of the joint
   application of the PP-Clay compatibilization with MA and the sonication
   during processing in a twin screw extruder. The greater level of clay
   dispersion was verified by the displacement of the XRD diffraction peak
   to lower angles, indicating an intercalated-exfoliated structure that

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Sn-containing group IV semiconductors create the possibility to
   independently control strain and band gap thus providing a wealth of
   opportunities to develop an entirely new class of low dimensional
   systems, heterostructures, and silicon-compatible electronic and
   optoelectronic devices. With this perspective, this work presents a
   detailed investigation of the band structure of strained and relaxed
   Ge1-x-ySixSny ternary alloys using a semi-empirical second nearest
   neighbors tight binding method. This method is based on an accurate
   evaluation of the deformation potential constants of Ge, Si, and
   alpha-Sn using a stochastic Monte-Carlo approach as well as a gradient
   based optimization method. Moreover, a new and efficient differential
   evolution approach is also developed to accurately reproduce the
   experimental effective masses and band gaps. Based on this, we
   elucidated the influence of lattice disorder, strain, and composition on
   Ge1-x-ySixSny band gap energy and directness. For 0 <= x <= 0.4 and 0 <=
   y <= 0.2, we found that tensile strain lowers the critical content of Sn
   needed to achieve a direct band gap semiconductor with the corresponding
   band gap energies below 0.76 eV. This upper limit decreases to 0.43 eV
   for direct gap, fully relaxed ternary alloys. The obtained transition to
   direct band gap is given by y > 0.605 x x + 0.077 and y > 1.364 x x +
   0.107 for epitaxially strained and fully relaxed alloys, respectively.
   The effects of strain, at a fixed composition, on band gap directness
   were also investigated and discussed. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},
