Abstract = {{Birefringent metasurfaces are two-dimensional structures capable of
   independently controlling the amplitude, phase, and polarization of
   orthogonally polarized incident waves. In this work, we propose an
   in-depth discussion on the mathematical synthesis of such metasurfaces.
   We compare the two methods, one that is rigorous and based on the exact
   electromagnetic fields involved in the transformation and one that is
   based on approximate reflection and transmission coefficients. We next
   validate the synthesis technique in metasurfaces performing the
   operations of a half-and quarter-wave plates, polarization beam
   splitting, and orbital angular momentum multiplexing and present the
   corresponding microwave experimental demonstrations. Published by AIP

Abstract = {{When a conductive polymer is blended with commodity polymers such as
   polyolefins and/or polystyrene (PS) as a ternary blend, it has a
   tendency to form the core phase due to its high interfacial tension with
   the other components. This can limit its capacity to reduce resistivity
   compared to situating it at the interface. In this work, starting with a
   ternary low-density polyethylene/polystyrene/poly(ether-block-amide)
   (LDPE/PS/PEBA) blend, we examine the influence of the conductive PEBA
   concentration on morphology and resistivity when it exists as a core
   phase. Then, the hierarchical structuring of the PEBA phase will be
   modified through two strategies: by the addition of a fourth phase
   (polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)) and
   by the addition of a copolymer interfacial modifier to the LDPE/PS/PEBA
   blend. Each of these approaches is shown to be capable of allowing the
   conductive PEBA to form a percolated structure assembled at the
   interface of two other continuous phases. The completely wet layered
   structuring of PEBA between PS and PVDF in the quaternary
   LDPE/PS/PEBA/PVDF blend leads to an exceptionally low percolation
   threshold of 0.37\% compared to 9.7\% in the initial LDPE/PS/PEBA blend
   where PEBA is the inside or core phase. To the best of our knowledge,
   this is the lowest value ever reported in the literature for a
   conductive polymer in melt blended systems.}},

Abstract = {{The control of phase structuring in multiphase blends of polylactide
   (PLA) with other polymers is a viable approach to promote its broader
   implementation. In this article, ternary and quaternary blends of PLA
   with poly(butylene succinate) (PBS), poly(butylene
   adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT), and
   poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) are prepared by melt
   blending. The interfacial tensions between components are measured using
   three different techniques, and a Fourier transform infrared imaging
   technique is developed for the purpose of unambiguous phase
   identification. A tricontinuous complete wetting behavior is observed
   for the ternary 33PLA/33PBS/33PBAT blend before and after quiescent
   annealing, which correlates closely with spreading theory analysis. In
   the quaternary PLA/PBS/PBAT/PHBV blend, a concentration-dependent
   wetting behavior is found. At 10 vol \% PBAT, self-assembled partially
   wet droplets of PBAT are observed at the interface of PBS and PHBV, and
   they remain stable after quiescent annealing as predicted by spreading
   theory. In contrast, at 25 vol \% PBAT, a quadruple continuous system is
   observed after mixing, which only transforms to partially wet PBAT
   droplets after subsequent annealing. These results clearly indicate the
   potential of composition control during the mixing of multiphase systems
   to result in a complete change of spreading behavior.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is composed of three self-consistent sections that can be
   read independently of each other. In Sec. 1, we define and analyze the
   low Mach number problem through a linear analysis of a perturbed linear
   wave equation. Then, we show how to modify Godunov-type schemes applied
   to the linear wave equation to make this scheme accurate at any Mach
   number. This allows to define an all Mach correction and to propose a
   linear all Mach Godunov scheme for the linear wave equation. In Sec. 2,
   we apply the all Mach correction proposed in Sec. 1 to the case of the
   nonlinear barotropic Euler system when the Godunov-type scheme is a Roe
   scheme. A linear stability result is proposed and a formal asymptotic
   analysis justifies the construction in this nonlinear case by showing
   how this construction is related with the linear analysis of Sec. 1. At
   last, we apply in Sec. 3 the all Mach correction proposed in Sec. 1 in
   the case of the full Euler compressible system. Numerous numerical
   results proposed in Secs. 1-3 justify the theoretical results and show
   that the obtained all Mach Godunov-type schemes are both accurate and
   stable for all Mach numbers. We also underline that the proposed
   approach can be applied to other schemes and allows to justify other
   existing all Mach schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Study Design.Consecutive case series analysis.Objective.To evaluate the
   surgical outcomes of patients with thoracic adolescent idiopathic
   scoliosis (AIS) in relation to different degrees of geometric
   torsion.Summary of Background Data.AIS is a three-dimensional (3D)
   deformity of the spine. A 3D classification of AIS, however, remains
   elusive because there is no widely accepted 3D parameter in the clinical
   practice. Recently, a new method of estimating geometric torsion has
   been proposed and detected two potential new 3D subgroups based on
   geometric torsion values.Methods.This is an analysis of 93 patients with
   Lenke type-1 deformity from our institution. 3D reconstructions were
   obtained using biplanar radiographs both pre- and postoperatively.
   Geometric torsion was computed using a novel technique by approximating
   local arc lengths at the neutral vertebra in the thoracolumbar segment.
   An inter- and intragroup statistical analysis was performed to compare
   clinical indices of patients with different torsion values. A
   qualitative assessment was also performed on each patient by two senior
   staff surgeons.Results.Statistically significant differences were
   observed in clinical indices between high (2.85 mm(-1)) and low torsion
   (0.83 mm(-1)) Lenke type 1 subgroups. Preoperatively, the high torsion
   group showed higher Cobb angle values in the thoracic segment (71.18
   degrees vs. 63.74 degrees), as well as higher angulation in the
   thoracolumbar plane of maximum deformity (67.79 degrees vs. 53.30
   degrees). Postoperatively, a statistically significant difference was
   found in the orientation of the plane of maximum deformity in the
   thoracolumbar segment between the high and low torsion groups (47.95
   degrees vs. 30.03 degrees). Results from the qualitative evaluation of
   surgical results showed different results between the two staff
   surgeons.Conclusion.These results suggest a link between preoperative
   torsion values and surgical outcomes within Lenke type 1 deformities.
   These results will need to be validated by an independent group, as it
   is a single-center study.Level of Evidence: 4}},

   investigated. The material is shown to be rate- and

   the welding/repair process might suggests otherwise, the response is
   found to be isotropic. Finally, a classic three dimension Johnson-Cook

Abstract = {{Solving a multi-input dynamic optimization of a batch processes is a
   complex problem involving interactions between input variables and
   constraints over time. The problem gets more difficult due to the
   presence of local solutions that have almost the same cost but widely
   varying structures. This paper studies various local optimal solutions
   for a non-isothermal semi-batch reactor with the feed rate and
   temperature as inputs and a heat removal constraint. Three solution
   patterns were studied, all consisting in meeting the heat removal
   constraint for the first part and seeking the compromise between the
   main and side reactions in the later part. A sensitivity analysis shows
   that the best solution pattern among those studied does not change with
   variations in parameters or initial conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Casing Treatment for Desensitization of Compressor Performance and
   Stability to Tip Clearance}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TURBOMACHINERY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the development of a novel casing treatment to
   reduce compressor performance and stall margin sensitivities to tip
   clearance increase. A linked research project on blade design strategies
   for desensitization had discovered two flow features that reduce
   sensitivity to tip clearance, namely increased incoming meridional
   momentum in the rotor tip region and reduction/elimination of double tip
   leakage flow. Double tip leakage flow is the flow that exits one tip
   clearance and enters the tip clearance of the circumferentially adjacent
   blade instead of convecting downstream out of the blade passage. A new
   and practical casing treatment was developed and analyzed through
   Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) computational fluid dynamics
   (CFD) simulations to decrease double tip leakage and reduce or even
   eliminate performance and stall margin sensitivity to tip clearance
   size. The casing treatment design consists of sawtooth-shaped
   circumferential indentations placed on the shroud over the rotor with a
   depth on the order of the tip clearance size. A detailed analysis of the
   flow field allowed for the elucidation of the flow mechanism associated
   with this casing treatment. A computational parametric study gave
   preliminary design rules for minimizing both performance/stall margin
   sensitivity to tip clearance and nominal performance loss. An improved
   casing indentation design was produced for which CFD simulations showed
   a complete desensitization of pressure ratio and stall margin while
   reducing efficiency sensitivity significantly for the tip clearance
   range studied with only a very small penalty in nominal pressure ratio.
   Further simulations showed that this casing treatment can be combined
   with desensitizing blade design strategies to further reduce tip
   sensitivity and reduce/eliminate/ reverse nominal performance penalty.
   Lastly, preliminary CFD simulations on an axial compressor stage
   indicate that this shallow indentations' casing treatment strategy
   remains effective in a stage environment.}},

Abstract = {{A periodic leaky-wave antenna is reported in substrate integrated

   applications. The antenna scan performance and leakage rate is dependent
   on the periodicity and size of the perturbation. Guidelines for choice
   of the parameters along with the condition for radiation of only one
   beam over the frequency range of interest are discussed. The developed
   antenna on Alumina substrate shows a good scan performance from -35
   degrees to 7 degrees over the frequency range 96 to 108 GHz with a gain

Abstract = {{The complexity of data and methods in industrial ecology (IE) keeps
   growing, and the demand for comprehensive and interdisciplinary
   assessments increases. To keep up with this development, the field needs
   a data infrastructure that allows researchers to annotate, store,
   retrieve, combine, and exchange data at low cost, without loss of
   information, and across disciplines and model frameworks. A
   consensus-building debate about how to describe the common object of
   study, socioeconomic metabolism (SEM), is necessary for the development
   of practical data structures and databases. We review the definitions of
   basic concepts to describe SEM in IE and related fields such as
   integrated assessment modeling. We find that many definitions are not
   compatible, are implicit, and are sometimes lacking. To resolve the
   conflicts and inconsistencies within the current definitions, we propose
   a hierarchical system of terms and definitions, a practical ontology,
   for describing objects, their properties, and events in SEM. We propose
   a typology of object properties and use sets to group objects into a
   hierarchical, mutually exclusive, and collectively exhaustive (H-MECE)
   classification. This grouping leads to a general definition of stocks.
   We show that a MECE representation of events necessarily requires two
   complementary concepts: processes and flows, for which we propose
   general definitions based on sets. Using these definitions, we show that
   the system structure of any interdisciplinary model of SEM can be
   formulated as a directed graph. We propose guidelines for semantic data
   annotation and database design, which can help to turn the vision of a
   powerful data infrastructure for SEM research into reality.}},

Abstract = {{By-product synergy is a growing practice worldwide. It consists in the
   maximization of resources utilization with the replacement of raw
   materials by by-products as inputs for industrial processes. In order to
   support decision making in such strategic projects, appropriate tools
   must be developed. This article presents the results of a research
   project, which includes the development of a multiobjective mathematical
   programming model for the optimization of by-product flows, synergy
   configurations, and investment decisions in eco-industrial networks.
   This model is evaluated using data related to the Kalundborg industrial
   symbiosis (IS) in order to illustrate its utilization, as well as to
   assess, in a retrospective manner, the behavior of the companies
   involved with respect to both economic and environmental benefits of
   synergies. The experiments also illustrate the influence of the
   municipality on synergy implementation and how a scenario-based approach
   can be used to anticipate raw material price increase. The results are
   generally coherent with the actual timing of synergy initializations.
   Further, the considerable effect of water price on the length of
   investments' payback period illustrates the impact of policies and
   regulations on IS.}},

Abstract = {{Several techniques are used by requirements engineering practitioners to
   address difficult problems such as specifying precise requirements while
   using inherently ambiguous natural language text and ensuring the
   consistency of requirements. Often, these problems are addressed by
   building processes/tools that combine multiple techniques where the
   output from 1 technique becomes the input to the next. While powerful,
   these techniques are not without problems. Inherent errors in each
   technique may leak into the subsequent step of the process. We model and
   study 1 such process, for checking the consistency of temporal
   requirements, and assess error leakage and wasted time. We perform an
   analysis of the input factors of our model to determine the effect that
   sources of uncertainty may have on the final accuracy of the consistency
   checking process. Convinced that error leakage exists and negatively
   impacts the results of the overall consistency checking process, we
   perform a second simulation to assess its impact on the analysts'
   efforts to check requirements consistency. We show that analyst's effort
   varies depending on the precision and recall of the subprocesses and
   that the number and capability of analysts affect their effort. We share
   insights gained and discuss applicability to other processes built of

Abstract = {{Melt compounding of polylactide with ductile polymers is widely proposed
   as an efficient alternative to overcome its inherent brittleness. An
   ethylene alkyl acrylate is used as toughening modifier of polylactide. A
   two-phase morphology is detected by melt blending of Polylactide and
   Biomax Strong. Furthermore, the effect of the addition of organically
   modified nanoparticles, Cloisite 15A, on phase morphology is
   investigated. A transesterification reaction occurs between the matrix
   and the toughening modifier, leading to the formation of a terpolymer at
   the interface in the polymer blends, influencing the interfacial
   properties. This transesterification reaction is effectively catalyzed
   by the incorporation of the nanoparticles. The in situ formed terpolymer
   reveals a distinct glass transition, as the polylactide blocks along the
   terpolymer chain architecture restricted the segmental mobility of the
   ethylene alkyl acrylate blocks. The development of the terpolymer
   suppressed the decrease of the complex viscosity within the timeframe of
   the dynamic measurements. Multiple crazing is the major energy
   dissipation mechanism in the deformation of hybrids. The formation of an
   interconnected morphology in the hybrids triggers a remarkable
   toughening of polylactide, through the enhanced contribution of matrix
   plastic deformation. (C) 2016 Society of Plastics Engineers.}},

   (Montreal, QC, Canada). Susceptibility to penicillin, erythromycin,
   clindamycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) was determined
   in accordance with the Clinical \& Laboratory Standards Institute
   guidelines.
   RESULTS: There were 324 unique episodes of MSSA bacteremia. Ninety
   (28\%) isolates were susceptible to penicillin, 229 (71\%) to
   erythromycin, 239 (74\%) to clindamycin, and 317 (98\%) to TMP-SMX.
   Isolates that were penicillin resistant were more likely to also be
   resistant to other antibiotics, but a statistically significant
   association was apparent only for erythromycin resistance (76/234,
   32.2\% vs 19/90, 21.1\%, P = .04). The median age of patients was 67.5
   years (interquartile range 52-78) and overall in-hospital 30-day
   mortality was 16.3\% (53 deaths). After adjustment for patient age,
   there was no association between penicillin resistance and either
   intensive care unit admission or death.
   CONCLUSION: More than one-quarter of patients with MSSA bacteremia
   potentially could be treated with parenteral penicillin, which may offer
   pharmacokinetic advantages over other beta-lactam drugs and potentially
   improved outcomes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases are characterized by the
   formation of a plaque in the arterial wall. Intravascular ultrasound
   (IVUS) provides high-resolution images allowing delineation of
   atherosclerotic plaques. When combined with near infrared fluorescence
   (NIRF), the plaque can also be studied at a molecular level with a large
   variety of biomarkers. In this work, we present a system enabling
   automated volumetric histology imaging of excised aortas that can
   spatially correlate results with combined IVUS/NIRF imaging of
   lipid-rich atheroma in cholesterol-fed rabbits. Pullbacks in the rabbit
   aortas were performed with a dual modality IVUS/NIRF catheter developed
   by our group. Ex vivo three-dimensional (3D) histology was performed
   combining optical coherence tomography (OCT) and confocal fluorescence
   microscopy, providing high-resolution anatomical and molecular
   information, respectively, to validate in vivo findings. The microscope
   was combined with a serial slicer allowing for the imaging of the whole
   vessel automatically. Colocalization of in vivo and ex vivo results is
   demonstrated. Slices can then be recovered to be tested in conventional
   histology.}},

Abstract = {{Implementations of the simplex method differ mostly in specific aspects
   such as the pivot rule. Similarly, most relaxation methods for
   mixed-integer programming differ mostly in the type of cuts and the
   exploration of the search tree. We provide a scripting mechanism to
   easily implement and experiment with primal and dual pivot rules for the
   simplex method, by building upon COIN-OR's open-source linear
   programming package CLP, without explicitly interacting with the
   underlying C++ layers of CLP. In the same manner, users can customize
   the solution process of mixed-integer linear programs using the CBC and
   CGL COIN-OR packages by coding branch-and-cut strategies and cut
   generators in Python. The Cython programming language ensures
   communication between Python and C++ libraries and activates
   user-defined customizations as callbacks. Our goal is to emphasize the
   ease of development in Python while maintaining acceptable performance.
   The resulting software, named CyLP, has become a part of COIN-OR and is
   available under open-source terms. For illustration, we provide an
   implementation of the positive edge rule-a recently proposed rule that
   is particularly efficient on degenerate problems-and demonstrate how to
   customize branch-and-cut node selection in the solution of a
   mixed-integer program.}},

Abstract = {{An approach to calculate various properties of solution is presented
   using CALPHAD phase diagram software. The properties include iso-bar,
   iso-activity, iso-activity coefficient, iso-sulfide capacity,
   iso-surface tension of various types of solutions such as liquid oxide
   or liquid alloy. Auxiliary phase(s) is introduced in order to set an
   equilibrium between a real solution and an auxiliary phase, where the
   property of the real solution is interesting. Gibbs energy of the
   auxiliary phase is set to yield a phase boundary between the real
   solution and the auxiliary phase, and the phase boundary becomes the
   iso-property line. The iso-property line is a phase boundary, therefore,
   it can be calculated as a Zero-Phase Fraction (ZPF) line of the
   auxiliary phase. This approach shows an easy way for calculating of the
   property diagram. The approach may be programmed into existing
   commercial CALPHAD software for the phase diagram calculation. (C) 2016

Title = {{Assembling copper nanowires at the interface and in discrete phases in
   PLA-based polymer blends}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN POLYMER JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{187-197}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This work examines the effects of kinetic parameters on the assembly of
   copper nanowires (CuNWs) in discrete phases and at the interface in two
   distinct blend systems: a high interfacial tension blend of poly(lactic
   acid), PLA, flow density polyethylene (LDPE) and a low interfacial
   tension blend of PLA/poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate), PBAT.
   CuNWs were synthesized through electrodeposition in a porous alumina
   oxide template. Considering the surface polarity of polymer melts and
   the hydrophilicity of the surface of CUNWs, the particles should be
   located in the more polar phase (PLA in PLA/LDPE or PBAT in PLA/PBAT).
   TEM images confirm that when CuNWs are initially premixed with the more
   polar phase, they remain in that phase in a stable fashion irrespective
   of the interfacial tension of the system. However, when the particles
   are premixed with the less polar phase, to investigate kinetic effects,
   different behaviors are observed; in PLA/LDPE blends, CuNWs partition
   between both phases, while in PLA/PBAT blends, CuNWs assemble at the
   interface and in the less polar PLA phase. The effects of mixing time
   and shear rate on these phenomena are examined, and importantly, for the
   low interfacial tension PLA/PBAT blend, it is shown that CuNWs can be
   assembled in a stable fashion at the interface. The mechanism of
   interfacial assembly of these cylindrically shaped CuNWs in PLA/PBAT is
   the result of enhanced bulk migration in the less polar PLA phase and
   slow migration rate across the interface. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This work studies the effect of the interfacial assembly of spherical
   nano-silica particles on the morphology, rheology and mechanical
   properties of heterophase poly(lactic acid), PLA, and poly(butylene
   adipate-co-terephthalate), PBAT, blends. Through a controlled mixing
   strategy, nano-silica particles could be assembled in a stable fashion
   at the PLA-PBAT interface. Rheological analysis indicates that the
   interfacial assembly of nano-silica significantly diminishes the
   relaxation of the dispersed PBAT phase and 3 wt.\% of nano-silica
   particles shifts the co-continuity region to a tower PBAT volume
   fraction. At co-continuity, the assembly of nano-silica at the interface
   changes the rheological behaviour of the co continuous PLA/PBAT from a
   liquid-like to a gel-like behaviour. The interfacial assembly of
   nano-silica reduces the co-continuous phase size but maintains
   co-continuity. The results of thermal annealing indicate a remarkable
   stabilization effect of interfacially assembled nano-silica on the
   co-continuous morphology. A conceptual model is proposed to explain the
   observed effects of interfacially assembled nano-silica on the
   morphology which emphasizes the critical role of nano-silica content,
   the relaxation time of the dispersed phase and the migration time of
   nano-silica to the interface. The mechanical properties of the PLA/PBAT
   blends are clearly influenced by the observed shift in co-continuity in
   the presence of nano-silica. Most importantly, the mechanical properties
   of co continuous PLA/PBAT are very sensitive to annealing due to
   morphological coarsening. Interfacially assembled nano-silica has the
   effect of completely stabilizing the co continuous morphology without
   any diminishing of the mechanical properties. These results clearly
   indicate the significant potential of the interfacial assembly of nano
   particles as a promising strategy toward achieving polymer blends with
   highly robust and stable co-continuous morphologies. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We are investigating a new class of linear characteristics schemes along
   cyclic tracks for solving the transport equation for neutral particles
   with scattering anisotropy. These algorithms rely on linear
   discontinuous exact integration and diamond differencing, as implemented
   with the method of discrete ordinates. These schemes are based on linear
   discontinuous coefficients that are derived through the application of
   approximations describing the mesh-averaged spatial flux moments in
   terms of spatial source moments and of the beginning-of-segment and
   end-of-segment flux values. The linear discontinuous characteristics
   (LDC) and quadratic-order diamond differencing (DD1) schemes are
   inherently conservative. In this technical note, we intend to continue
   the development of the LDC and DD1 schemes by extending their
   application to cyclic trackings. This extension will make possible the
   representation of reflective or general albedo boundary conditions. We
   will present an improved and much shorter derivation of the LDC and DD1
   schemes, compared to a previous presentation. Finally, we will implement
   the new schemes as Matlab scripts for solving a one-dimensional slab
   benchmark and in the DRAGON5 lattice code for solving a more
   representative two-dimensional eight-symmetry pressurized water reactor
   assembly mock-up.}},

Abstract = {{L In order to provide constraints on the interpretation of seismic data
   of the crust beneath the South China Sea (SCS) and its continental
   margins, we have measured P-wave velocities and anisotropy as a function
   of hydrostatic confining pressure, up to 650 MPa, for 31 representative
   samples (i.e., granite, diorite, felsic gneiss, mylonite and
   ultramylonite, amphibolite, schist, and marble) from the Yunkai Mts
   (Guangdong and Guangxi Provinces, China) that represent the crystalline
   basement beneath the continental margins of the SCS. The intrinsic
   velocity of each crack-free rock increases With increasing density (rho)
   which is linearly dependent on the chemical composition: rho increases
   with increasing MgO, CaO, FeO + Fe2O3, and Al2O3 contents, but decreases
   with increasing contents of SiO2 and Na2O + K2O. Most of the rocks have
   small (<4\%) or moderate (4-8\%) seismic anisotropy because (1) the
   contribution of quartz to the bulk anisotropy opposes that of feldspar,
   and (2) the rocks only contain small amounts of amphibole and/or mica.
   The interpretation of 12 seismic transects suggests that the crust of
   the Cathaysia block (the southern part of South China) has a
   mafic-to-felsic layer thickness ratio (R-m/f) of 41-43\% and the ratio
   shows a general increase from the continental margin to the central
   basin. The high velocity (7.0-7.6 km/s) materials in the lower crust
   could be either the former lower crustal mafic rocks that were present
   before rifting, which have experienced less extensional thinning than
   the felsic upper crust, or the materials crystallized from mafic magma
   which underplated the lower crust from the partially molten upper mantle
   during rifting. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Owing to its crystallographic structure, black phosphorus is one of the
   few 2D materials expressing strongly anisotropic optical, transport, and
   mechanical properties. We report on the anisotropy of electron-phonon
   interactions through a polarization-resolved Raman study of the four
   vibrational modes of atomically thin black phosphorus (2D phosphane):
   the three bulk-like modes A(g)(1), B-2g, and A(g)(2) and the
   Davydov-induced mode labeled A(g)(B-2u). The complex Raman tensor
   elements reveal that the relative variation in permittivity of all A(g)
   modes is irrespective of the atomic motion involved lowest along the
   zigzag direction, the basal anisotropy of these variations is most
   pronounced for A(g)(2) and A(g)(B-2u)) and interlayer interactions in
   multilayer samples lead to reduced anisotropy. The bulk-forbidden
   A(g)(B-2u) mode appears for n >= 2 and quickly subsides in thicker
   layers. It is assigned to a Davydov-induced IR to Raman conversion of
   the bulk IR mode Btu and exhibits characteristics similar to A(g)(2).
   Although this mode is expected to be weak, an electronic resonance
   significantly enhances its Raman efficiency such that it becomes a
   dominant mode in the spectrum of bilayer 2D phosphane.}},

Journal = {{BIOMASS \& BIOENERGY}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work is to differentiate between the yield and
   composition of bio-oils obtained from microwave and conventional
   pyrolysis of kraft lignin. Four different conditions were performed,
   microwave and conventional pyrolysis with and without mixing the raw
   material with a strong microwave receptor. The key findings of this work
   include that applying microwaves in pyrolysis applications leads to
   preserifing the structure of the obtained products, which consequently
   enhances the product selectivity. As a result, the liquid product from
   the pyrolysis of lignin contains 40\% more chemicals, and 27\% less
   water than that of the conventional pyrolysis. The impact of
   electromagnetic waves on the quantitative aspect is not considerable as
   the difference between the liquid yields from both techniques is slight.
   Increasing the heating rate and/or the residence time, particularly in
   conventional pyrolysis, makes secondary reactions play a vital role in
   decomposing and/or combining the obtained aromatic hydrocarbons. (C)

   Epidemiological data suggest that in men, overall abdominal obesity is
   the second most important environmental risk factor after smoking for
   progression to late-stage NV AMD. To date, the mechanisms that
   underscore this observation remain ill-defined. Given the impact of
   high-fat diets on gut microbiota, we investigated whether commensal
   microbes influence the evolution of AMD. Using mouse models of NV AMD,
   microbiotal transplants, and other paradigms that modify the gut
   microbiome, we uncoupled weight gain from confounding factors and
   demonstrate that high-fat diets exacerbate choroidal neovascularization
   (CNV) by altering gut microbiota. Gut dysbiosis leads to heightened
   intestinal permeability and chronic low-grade inflammation
   characteristic of inflammaging with elevated production of IL-6,
   IL-1,TNF-, and VEGF-A that ultimately aggravate pathological

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to determine the intra- and intersession
   reliability of nonnormalized surface electromyography (sEMG) on the
   muscles actuating the forearm during maximum voluntary isometric
   contractions (MVIC). A subobjective of this study is to determine the
   intra- and intersession reliability of forearm MVIC force or torque,
   which is a prerequisite to assess sEMG reliability. Eighteen healthy
   adults participated at 4 different times: baseline, 1-h post, 6-h post,
   and 24-h post. They performed 3 MVIC trials of forearm flexion,
   extension, pronation, and supination. sEMG of the biceps brachii short
   head, brachialis, brachioradialis, triceps brachii long head, pronator
   teres, and pronator quadratus were measured. The intraclass correlation
   coefficient (ICC) on MVIC ranged from 0.36 to 0.99. Reliability was
   excellent for flexion, extension, and supination MVIC for both intra-
   and intersession. The ICC on sEMG ranged from 0.58 to 0.99. sEMG
   reliability was excellent for brachialis, brachioradialis, and pronator
   quadratus, and good to excellent for triceps brachii, biceps brachii,
   and pronator teres. This study shows that performing 3 MVICs is
   sufficient to obtain highly reliable maximal sEMG over 24 h for the main
   muscles actuating the forearm. These results confirm the potential of
   sEMG for muscle motor functional monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Development of a subject-specific computational musculoskeletal trunk
   model (accounting for age, sex, body weight and body height), estimation
   of muscle forces and internal loads as well as subsequent validation by
   comparison with measured intradiscal pressure in various lifting tasks
   are novel, important and challenging. The objective of the present study
   is twofold. First, it aims to update and personalize the passive and
   active structures in an existing musculoskeletal kinematics-driven
   finite element model. The scaling scheme used an existing imaging
   database and biomechanical principles to adjust muscle
   geometries/cross-sectional-areas and passive joint geometry/properties
   in accordance with subjects' sex, age, body weight and body height.
   Second, using predictions of a detailed passive finite element model of
   the ligamentous lumbar spine, a novel nonlinear regression equation was
   proposed that relates the intradiscal pressure (IDP) at the L4-L5 disc
   to its compression force and intersegmental flexion rotation. Predicted
   IDPs and muscle activities of the personalized models under various
   tasks are found in good-to-excellent agreement with reported
   measurements. Results indicate the importance of personal parameters
   when computing muscle forces and spinal loads especially at larger trunk
   flexion angles as minor changes in individual parameters yielded up to
   30\% differences in spinal forces. For more accurate subject-specific
   estimation of spinal loads and muscle activities, such a comprehensive
   trunk model should be used that accounts for subject's personalized
   features on active musculature and passive spinal structure.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrological processes and water resources are increasingly modified by
   anthropogenic actions, leading to multiple pressures on the environment
   and related ecosystems. A better understanding of the interactions
   between the anthroposphere and the hydrosphere is necessary to shape
   more sustainable societies. The pressure of human activities on the
   environment is especially high along the circum-Mediterranean area
   because of a combination of biophysical and economic factors. The Campo
   de Cartagena coastal plain, together with the Mar Menor lagoon, is one
   of the most exemplary areas in this aspect. This work analyzes this
   system at the basin level by providing a synthesis of the state of
   knowledge of each hydrological compartment and the links between them.
   We pay special attention to the important role that groundwater plays in
   the overall functioning of the system, both as a promoting and (or)
   mitigating agent. The principal identified impacts from human actions
   are water imbalance (28\% of consumed water resources are not
   renewable); aquifer-cross contamination (high areal density, similar to
   1.2 wells/km(2)); acid-mine drainage (mine wastes, accounting for
   similar to 175 hm(3) on land and similar to 25 hm(3) in the sea,
   accumulated mainly between 1957 and 1992); and lagoon eutrophication
   (NO3- up to 1 mg/L). A set of mitigation options and complementary
   management measures that should be implemented following an integrative
   and holistic approach are presented and discussed, supporting a more
   sustainable regional economy and the recovery of critical ecosystem
   services.}},

Abstract = {{Human exposure to particulate matter (PM) has been associated with
   adverse health effects. While inhalation exposure to airborne PM is a
   prominent research subject, exposure to PM of geological origin (i.e.,
   generated from soil/soil-like material) has received less attention.
   This review discusses the contaminants in PM of geological origin and
   their relevance for human exposure and then evaluates lung
   bioaccessibility assessment methods and their use. PM of geological
   origin can contain toxic elements as well as organic contaminants.
   Observed/predicted PM lung clearance times are long, which may lead to
   prolonged contact with lung environment. Thus, certain exposure
   scenarios warrant the use of in vitro bioaccessibility testing to
   predict lung bioavailability. Limited research is available on lung
   bioaccessibility test development and test application to PM of
   geological origin. For in vitro tests, test parameter variation between
   different studies and concerns about physiological relevance indicate a
   crucial need for test method standardization and comparison with
   relevant animal data. Research is recommended on (1) developing robust
   in vitro lung bioaccessibility methods, (2) assessing bioaccessibility
   of various contaminants (especially polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
   (PAHs)) in PM of diverse origin (surface soils, mine tailings, etc.),
   and (3) risk characterization to determine relative importance of
   exposure to PM of geological origin.}},

Abstract = {{Bloodstream infections with Staphylococcus aureus are clinically

   requirement for empirical vancomycin therapy. We reviewed consecutive S.
   aureus bacteremias over a 5-year period at two tertiary care hospitals.
   MRSA colonization was evaluated in three ways: as tested within 30 days
   of bacteremia (30-day criterion), as tested within 30 days but
   accounting for any prior positive results (ever-positive criterion), or
   as tested in known-positive patients, with patients with unknown MRSA
   status being labeled negative (known-positive criterion). There were 409
   S. aureus bacteremias: 302 (73.8\%) methicillin-susceptible S. aureus
   (MSSA) and 107 (26.2\%) MRSA bacteremias. In the 167 patients with MSSA
   bacteremias, 7.2\% had a positive MRSA test within 30 days. Of 107
   patients withMRSAbacteremia, 68 were tested within 30 days (54 positive;
   79.8\%), and another 21 (19.6\%) were previously positive. The 30-day
   criterion provided negative predictive values (NPV) exceeding 90\% and
   95\% if the prevalence of MRSA in S. aureus bacteremia was less than
   33.4\% and 19.2\%, respectively. The same NPVs were predicted at MRSA
   proportions below 39.7\% and 23.8\%, respectively, for the ever-positive
   criterion and 34.4\% and 19.9\%, respectively, for the known-positive
   criterion. In MRSA-colonized patients, positive predictive values
   exceeded 50\% at low prevalence. MRSAscreening could help avoid
   empirical vancomycin therapy and its complications in stable patients
   and settings with low-to-moderate proportions ofMRSAbacteremia.}},

Abstract = {{Frameworks are widely used in modern software development to reduce
   development costs. They are accessed through their Application
   Programming Interfaces (APIs), which specify the contracts with client
   programs. When frameworks evolve, API backward-compatibility cannot
   always be guaranteed and client programs must upgrade to use the new
   releases. Because framework upgrades are not cost-free, observing API
   changes and usages together at fine-grained levels is necessary to help
   developers understand, assess, and forecast the cost of each framework
   upgrade. Whereas previous work studied API changes in frameworks and API
   usages in client programs separately, we analyse and classify API
   changes and usages together in 22 framework releases from the Apache and
   Eclipse ecosystems and their client programs. We find that (1) missing
   classes and methods happen more often in frameworks and affect client
   programs more often than the other API change types do, (2) missing
   interfaces occur rarely in frameworks but affect client programs often,
   (3) framework APIs are used on average in 35 \% of client classes and
   interfaces, (4) most of such usages could be encapsulated locally and
   reduced in number, and (5) about 11 \% of APIs usages could cause ripple
   effects in client programs when these APIs change. Based on these
   findings, we provide suggestions for developers and researchers to
   reduce the impact of API evolution through language mechanisms and
   design strategies.}},

Abstract = {{LiFePO4 was prepared from low-cost iron ore concentrate (containing 4.48
   wt.\% SiO2 and MgO, CaO and Al2O3 below 0.5 wt.\% as contaminant) using
   a melt synthesis. X-ray diffraction (XRD) refinement associated with
   Mossbauer spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy-energy
   dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) analyses are used to track the
   location of Si in the material. It is shown that the iron content in the
   melt can be used as a means to control the doping rate of elements from
   iron ore concentrate (IOC) precursor according to the formula (Li1 - z A
   (z) )(Fe1 - y M (y) )(P1 - x Si (x) )O-4. Electrochemical behavior of
   the material is affected by the doping of LiFePO4. While capacity is
   decreased in doped material, the cycling stability is much improved.
   When dopants are out of LiFePO4 structure, capacity retention
   dramatically drops as well as capacity due to the gravimetric impact of
   impurity phases. A trade-off between high capacity and best cycling
   performance is necessary. For instance, slight lack of iron in the melt
   (6 \% deficiency) leads to a capacity only 2 \% lower than that of pure
   Fe2O3-based material for the same stoichiometry and fairly good capacity
   retention.}},

Abstract = {{Mixed integer programming (MIP) is commonly used to model indicator
   constraints, i.e., constraints that either hold or are relaxed depending
   on the value of a binary variable. Unfortunately, those models tend to
   lead to weak continuous relaxations and turn out to be unsolvable in
   practice; this is what happens, for e.g., in the case of Classification
   problems with Ramp Loss functions that represent an important
   application in this context. In this paper we show the computational
   evidence that a relevant class of these Classification instances can be
   solved far more efficiently if a nonlinear, nonconvex reformulation of
   the indicator constraints is used instead of the linear one. Inspired by
   this empirical and surprising observation, we show that aggressive bound
   tightening is the crucial ingredient for solving this class of
   instances, and we devise a pair of computationally effective algorithmic
   approaches that exploit it within MIP. One of these methods is currently
   part of the arsenal of IBM-Cplex since version 12.6.1. More generally,
   we argue that aggressive bound tightening is often overlooked in MIP,
   while it represents a significant building block for enhancing MIP
   technology when indicator constraints and disjunctive terms are present.}},

Abstract = {{A new algorithm for the optimal stope design problem is proposed. It is
   based on a previous methodology developed by Bai et al. (Comput Geosci
   52:361-371, 2013a) where a cylindrical coordinate system is used to
   define geomechanical restrictions and to find the optimal stope around
   an initial raise. The new algorithm extends this work using an integer
   programming formulation and a new set of constraints, aimed to solve
   geomechanical issues present on the original methodology. The new
   formulation is tested on two synthetic and one real deposits. An
   economic, geomechanical and feasibility analysis is performed, comparing
   the new results with Bai's methodology. This methodology achieves better
   stope designs in terms of geomechanical stability and wall regularity,
   generating feasible stopes for real use. It also allows further
   extensions to incorporate other geometrical constraints in order to
   obtain more regular stope designs.}},

Abstract = {{Dust suppression of hauling roads in open pit mines is done by
   periodically spraying water from a water truck. The objective of this
   paper is to present and compare two methods for locating water depots
   along the road network so that penalty costs for the lack of humidity in
   roads and routing costs are minimized. Because the demands are located
   on the arcs of the network and the arcs require service more than once
   in a time horizon, this problem belongs to the periodic capacitated arc
   routing domain. We compare two methods for finding the initial depot
   location. We then use an exchange algorithm to modify the initial
   location and an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm to modify
   the initial routing of vehicles. This method is the first one used for
   depot location in periodic arc routing problems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Identifying an economic alternative to nickel oxide that is non-toxic,
   and stable over thousands of cycles continues to drive chemical-looping
   process development. Mineral ores meet many of these criteria and
   ilmenite is prominent among the ores tested to date. However,
   pyrolusite, a manganese oxide containing more than 85\% amorphous MnO2
   in its fresh form, can transfer more than 3 times oxygen compared to
   ilmenite - as much as 7\% of its own mass. In addition, the oxygen
   transfer capacity can be increased by preheating pyrolusite under an
   oxidizing atmosphere. It can then transfer almost double its
   experimental oxygen transfer capacity versus pyrolusite pre-treated in
   an inert environment. Together with excellent oxygen carrying capacity,
   it has adequate attrition resistance and costs fraction of ilmenite. In
   addition, the solid inventory in the reduction reactor would represent
   8\% of that required for ilmenite and the solid circulation would drop
   by 30\%, but the fresh particle makeup would be 4 times higher based on
   measurements from a laboratory-scale submerged jet attrition mill. (C)

Abstract = {{This article describes the generation of elastic shear waves in a soft
   medium using a laser beam. Our experiments show two different regimes
   depending on laser energy. Physical modeling of the underlying phenomena
   reveals a thermoelastic regime caused by a local dilatation resulting
   from temperature increase and an ablative regime caused by a partial
   vaporization of the medium by the laser. The computed theoretical
   displacements are close to the experimental measurements. A numerical
   study based on the physical modeling gives propagation patterns
   comparable to those generated experimentally. These results provide a
   physical basis for the feasibility of a shear wave elastography
   technique (a technique that measures a soft solid stiffness from shear
   wave propagation) by using a laser beam. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to characterize and model the vibration
   behaviour of entangled carbon fibres cross-linked with epoxy resin. The
   material is tested in shear, in a double lap configuration. Experimental
   testing is carried out for frequencies varying from 1 Hz to 80 Hz and
   for shear strain amplitudes ranging from 5.10(-4) to 1.10(-2). Measured
   shear stress-strain hysteresis loops show a nonlinear behaviour with a
   low frequency dependency.
   The hysteresis loops are decomposed in a linear part and three nonlinear
   parts: a dry friction hysteresis, a stiffening term and a stiction-like
   overshoot term. The Generalized Dahl Model is used in conjunction with
   other hysteresis models to develop an appropriate description of the
   measured hysteresis loops, based on the three nonlinear parts. In
   particular, a new one-state formulation of the Bliman-Sorine model is
   developed. A new identification procedure is also introduced for the
   Dahl model, based on the so-called backbone curve. The model is shown to
   capture well the complex shapes of the measured hysteresis loops at all
   amplitudes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Firms selling perishable products use a variety of techniques to
   maximize revenue through the dynamic control of their inventories. One
   of the most powerful and simple approaches to address this issue
   consists of assigning threshold values ({''}bid prices{''}) to each
   resource, and to accept requests whenever their revenue exceeds the sum
   of the bid prices associated with its constituent resources. In this
   context, we propose a new customer choice-based mathematical program to
   estimate time-dependent bid prices. In contrast with most approaches
   from the current literature, ours is characterized by its flexibility.
   Indeed, it can easily embed technical and practical constraints that
   occur in most central reservation systems (CRS). To solve the model, we
   develop a column generation algorithm, in which the NP-hard subproblem
   is addressed via an efficient heuristic procedure. Our computational
   results illustrate the performance of the method, through comparisons
   with alternative proposals. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by

Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Reversible evolution of macroscopic and mesoscopic systems can be
   conveniently constructed from two ingredients: an energy functional and
   a Poisson bracket. The goal of this paper is to elucidate how the
   Poisson brackets can be constructed and what additional features we also
   gain by the construction. In particular, the Poisson brackets governing
   reversible evolution in one-particle kinetic theory, kinetic theory of
   binary mixtures, binary fluid mixtures, classical irreversible
   thermodynamics and classical hydrodynamics are derived from Liouville
   equation. Although the construction is quite natural, a few examples
   where it does not work are included (e.g. the BBGKY hierarchy). Finally,
   a new infinite grand canonical hierarchy of Poisson brackets is
   proposed, which leads to Poisson brackets expressing non-local phenomena
   such as turbulent motion or evolution of polymeric fluids.. Eventually,
   Lie Poisson structures standing behind some of the brackets are
   identified. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{318}},
Pages = {{48-53}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this work is to evaluate the selectivity and solubility
   of a buffer chelant. The buffer chelant is
   ethylenediamine-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA.3EDA) and its performance is
   compared to NTA. All experiments were conducted on batches of 25 g of
   soil in an autoclave at 25 degrees C or 75 degrees C with a constant
   ratio of 2. The experiments were conducted under a CO2 overhead to lower
   the reaction pH. The buffer chelant allows a 5-fold selectivity increase
   for heavy metals while increasing or maintaining the same molar
   extraction yield compared to NTA. These selectivity and extraction
   results stand out from those obtained with other neutralized NTA. NTA,
   EDA and the acid gas CO2 are the three necessary ligands in the NTA.3EDA
   extraction mechanism. A reaction temperature setpoint increase causes a
   higher Fe dissolution. However, this does not lower the NTA and NTA.3EDA
   selectivity for heavy metals. Thus, Fe is a non-interfering cation in
   the NTA and NTA.3EDA extraction mechanisms. This non-interference is
   less apparent in the NTA extraction mechanism. The present work intends
   to share another perspective on the design of more selective and soluble
   chelants for heavy metal extraction. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Graphlet analysis is part of network theory that does not depend on the
   choice of the network null model and can provide comprehensive
   description of the local network structure. Here, we propose a novel
   method for graphlet-based analysis of directed networks by computing
   first the signature vector for every vertex in the network and then the
   graphlet correlation matrix of the network. This analysis has been
   applied to brain effective connectivity networks by considering both
   direction and sign (inhibitory or excitatory) of the underlying directed
   (effective) connectivity. In particular, the signature vectors for brain
   regions and the graphlet correlation matrices of the brain effective
   network are computed for 40 healthy subjects and common dependencies are
   revealed. We found that the signature vectors (node, wedge, and triangle
   degrees) are dominant for the excitatory effective brain networks.
   Moreover, by considering only those correlations (or anti correlations)
   in the correlation matrix that are significant (>0.7 or <-0.7) and are
   presented in more than 60\% of the subjects, we found that excitatory
   effective brain networks show stronger causal (measured with Granger
   causality) patterns (G-causes and G-effects) than inhibitory effective
   brain networks.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the development of detailed simulation models to
   study short-circuit protection of on-board dc auxiliary systems in a
   rapid transit train. As the investigation of protection solutions during
   the testing phases is costly, it is necessary to perform detailed
   protection analysis earlier in order to detect potential protection
   issues. This requires modeling the behavior of batteries, auxiliary
   converters, and the detection and arcing mechanisms of protection
   devices in detail, as shown in this paper. The protection device under
   consideration in this study is the molded-case circuit breakers (MCCBs)
   equipped with adjustable thermomagnetic trip unit which are widely used
   in the railway industry. To maintain battery system availability, they
   are selected, sized, and adjusted to avoid false tripping during
   emergency conditions. However, they must also be sensitive enough to
   detect the limited available fault current which is specific to rapid
   transit train dc auxiliary systems. Tolerances on the detection time of
   thermomagnetic units may be unacceptable as shown in this study. In
   order to overcome this problem, electronic trip unit assistance to
   conventional thermomagnetic-type MCCBs is proposed and the requirements
   for such a device are evaluated using the detailed simulation platform.}},

Abstract = {{Mitchell's solution is commonly used to determine the required strength
   of vertically exposed cemented backfill in mines. Developed for drained
   backfill, Mitchell model assumed a zero friction angle for the backfill.
   Physical model tests were performed. Good agreements were obtained
   between the required strengths predicted by the analytical solution and
   experimental results. However, it is well-known that zero friction angle
   can only be possible in terms of total stresses when geomaterials are
   submitted to unconsolidated and undrained conditions. A revisit to
   Mitchell's physical model tests reveals that both the laboratory tests
   performed for obtaining the shear strength parameters of the cemented
   backfill and the box stability tests were conducted under a condition
   close to undrained condition. This explains well the good agreement
   between Mitchell's solution and experimental results. Good agreements
   are equally obtained between Mitchell's experimental results and FLAC3D

Abstract = {{This work demonstrates the combination of optical coherence tomography
   (OCT) and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) using a double-clad optical fiber
   coupler. The single-mode core of the fiber is used for OCT imaging,
   while the inner cladding of the double-clad fiber provides an efficient
   way to capture the reflectance spectrum of the sample. The combination
   of both methods enables three-dimensional acquisition of the sample
   morphology with OCT, enhanced with complementary molecular information
   contained in the hyperspectral image. The HSI data can be used to
   highlight the presence of specific molecules with characteristic
   absorption peaks or to produce true color images overlaid on the OCT
   volume for improved tissue identification by the clinician. Such a
   system could be implemented in a number of clinical endoscopic
   applications and could improve the current practice in tissue
   characterization, diagnosis, and surgical guidance. (C) The Authors.

   approaches, the proposed method can handle sheets exhibiting both

Journal = {{AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{601-617}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A numerical model is presented in this paper to simulate the aerodynamic
   behavior of combined conical cylindrical shells. This class of
   structures is of great interest due to its extensive use in aeronautical
   and aerospace applications. Two distinct semi-analytical finite elements
   are used to model a combined axisymmetric shell for better geometrical
   consistency. The structural formulation is a combination of the finite
   element method and classical shell theory. The displacement functions of
   each finite element are derived from exact solutions of Sanders' shell
   equilibrium equations. The linearized first-order piston theory formula
   is applied to take into account the aerodynamic interaction effect. For
   a liquid contained in the combined shell, the fluid pressure is derived
   from the velocity potential, Bernoulli equation and from the
   impermeability condition applied to ensure permanent coupling at the
   fluid-solid interface. Initial stress stiffening due to axial
   compression and/or radial pressure is accounted for by generating an
   additional stiffness matrix. The elementary matrices of the solid and
   fluid corresponding to each finite element are calculated using exact
   analytical integration. Results obtained using the present approach in
   various conditions such as under vacuum, filled with liquid and
   subjected to supersonic flow are compared to those in published
   experimental or numerical works. Good agreement is found. (C) 2016

   Influence on Intervertebral Disks and Growth Plates in a Porcine Model}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL SPINE SURGERY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{Study Design: In vivo porcine model utilized to evaluate the influence
   of an intravertebral fusionless growth modulating device (hemi-staple)
   on intervertebral disks and growth plates.
   Objective: To evaluate the radiographic and histologic changes in disks
   and growth plates with the purpose of measuring influence of the
   explored hemi-staple.
   Summary of Background Data: Fusionless growth modulation for the early
   treatment of scoliosis should insure the long-term viability of the
   intervertebral disk and successfully reduce or arrest local growth. A
   novel hemi-staple that proved effective in the control of coronal spinal
   alignment warranted further analyses of its influence on the disk health
   and growth-plate morphology.
   Methods: A hemi-staple that inhibited local vertebral growth exclusive
   of the disk was introduced over T5-T8 in 4 immature pigs (16 vertebrae;
   experimental), whereas 3 underwent surgery without instrumentation
   (sham) and 2 had no intervention (control). Three-month follow-up before
   animal euthanasia provided radiographic (disk height and health) and
   histologic (growth plate morphology, disk health, and type X collagen
   distribution) analyses.
   Results: No postoperative complications were experienced. Radiographic
   data returned inverse disk wedging (greater disk height adjacent to
   device, 2.6 +/- 0.7 mm compared with the noninstrumented side, 1.8 +/-
   0.5 mm) in experimental segments and suggested disk viability.
   Histologic data confirmed device growth modulation through significant
   local reduction of growth plate hypertrophic zone (125.64 +/- 16.61 mu m
   and 61.16 +/- 8.25 mu m in noninstrumented and instrumented sections,
   respectively) and cell height (16.14 +/- 1.87 mu m and 9.22 +/- 1.57 mu
   m in noninstrumented and instrumented sections, respectively). A
   variability of disk health, dependant of device insertion location, was
   observed. Type X collagen was consistently identified in experimental
   growth plates and absent from intervertebral disks.
   Conclusions: Hemi-staples decreased growth plate hypertrophic zone and
   cell height, and, depending on device insertion site, showed positive
   signs of disk health sustainability. Spinal growth modulation achieved
   exclusive of disk compression, as practiced by this method, offers
   unique advantages over other fusionless techniques. This technique may
   provide a suitable and attractive alternative for the early treatment of
   idiopathic scoliosis.}},

Abstract = {{In an urban environment, intersections are critical locations in terms
   of road crashes and number of killed or injured people. Vehicular ad hoc
   networks (VANETs) can help reduce the traffic collisions at
   intersections by sending warning messages to the vehicles. However, the
   performance of VANETs should be enhanced to guarantee delivery of the
   messages, particularly safety messages to the destination. Data
   congestion control is an efficient way to decrease packet loss and delay
   and increase the reliability of VANETs. In this paper, a centralized and
   localized data congestion control strategy is proposed to control data
   congestion using roadside units (RSUs) at intersections. The proposed
   strategy consists of three units for detecting congestion, clustering
   messages, and controlling data congestion. In this strategy, the channel
   usage level is measured to detect data congestion in the channels. The
   messages are gathered, filtered, and then clustered by machine learning
   algorithms. K-means algorithm clusters the messages based on message
   size, validity of messages, and type of messages. The data congestion
   control unit determines appropriate values of transmission range and
   rate, contention window size, and arbitration interframe spacing for
   each cluster. Finally, RSUs at the intersections send the determined
   communication parameters to the vehicles stopped before the red traffic
   lights to reduce communication collisions. Simulation results show that
   the proposed strategy significantly improves the delay, throughput, and
   packet loss ratio in comparison with other congestion control strategies
   using the proposed congestion control strategy.}},

Abstract = {{PurposeTo measure magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters including
   relaxation times (T-1, T-2), magnetization transfer (MT) and diffusion
   parameters (mean diffusivity {[}MD], fractional anisotropy {[}FA]) of
   intervertebral discs in adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis, and to
   investigate the sensitivity of these MR parameters to the severity of
   the spine deformities.
   Materials and MethodsThirteen patients with adolescent idiopathic
   scoliosis and three control volunteers with no history of spine disease
   underwent an MRI acquisition at 3T including the mapping of T-1, T-2,
   MT, MD, and FA. The apical zone included all discs within the scoliotic
   curve while the control zone was composed of other discs. The severity
   was analyzed through low (<32 degrees) versus high (>40 degrees) Cobb
   angles. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and agglomerative
   hierarchical clustering (AHC) were performed.
   ResultsSignificant differences were found between the apical zone and
   the control zone for T-2 (P = 0.047), and between low and high Cobb
   angles for T-2 (P = 0.014) and MT (P = 0.002). AHC showed two distinct
   clusters, one with mainly low Cobb angles and one with mainly high Cobb
   angles, for the MRI parameters measured within the apical zone, with an
   accuracy of 0.9 and a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.8.
   Within the control zone, the AHC showed no clear classification
   (accuracy of 0.6 and MCC of 0.2).
   ConclusionWe successfully performed an in vivo multiparametric MRI
   investigation of young patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.
   The MRI parameters measured within the intervertebral discs were found
   to be sensitive to intervertebral disc degeneration occurring with
   scoliosis and to the severity of scoliosis. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging

Abstract = {{We propose a way to estimate a generalized recursive route choice model.
   The model generalizes other existing recursive models in the literature,
   i.e., (Fosgerau et al., 2013b; Mai et al., 2015c), while being more
   flexible since it allows the choice at each stage to be any member of
   the network multivariate extreme value (network MEV) model (Daly and
   Bierlaire, 2006). The estimation of the generalized model requires
   defining a contraction mapping and performing contraction iterations to
   solve the Bellman's equation. Given the fact that the contraction
   mapping is defined based on the choice probability generating functions
   (CPGF) (Fosgerau et al., 2013b) generated by the network MEV models, and
   these CPGFs are complicated, the generalized model becomes difficult to
   estimate. We deal with this challenge by proposing a novel method where
   the network of correlation structures and the structure parameters given
   by the network MEV models are integrated into the transport network. The
   approach allows to simplify the contraction mapping and to make the
   estimation practical on real data.
   We apply the new method on real data by proposing a recursive
   cross-nested logit (RCNL) model, a member of the generalized model,
   where the choice model at each stage is a cross-nested logit. We report
   estimation results and a prediction study based on a real network. The
   results show that the RCNL model performs significantly better than the
   other recursive models in fit and prediction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In the existing fragility assessment, most bridges are short-span
   bridges and a few bridges have long spans such as cable-stayed bridges.
   In this study, a procedure is proposed to conduct the component and
   system seismic fragility analysis of long-span cable-stayed bridges.
   Three critical issues are addressed in the procedure: (1) the optimal
   intensity measure of cable-stayed bridges, (2) limit state models of
   various components, and (3) contribution of individual components to the
   entire system failure of bridges. This study chooses a long-span
   cable-stayed bridge with the most common configuration in China and
   builds the numerical model of its multiple components using OpenSEES
   that can account for their nonlinear response and uncertainties in the
   ground motion and material properties. Four typical intensity measures
   are compared with respect to four characteristic properties including
   efficiency, practicality, sufficiency, and proficiency. Peak ground
   velocity turns out to be the optimal intensity measure. Limit states of
   pylon sections are derived by a numerical simulation based on pushover
   analysis and China's guidelines. The pushover results indicate that the
   limit state of their section curvature depends highly on the section
   type and axial compression coefficient. A joint probabilistic seismic
   demand model and Monte Carlo simulation are employed to obtain an
   accurate system fragility estimate of cable-stayed bridges by accounting
   for the contribution of each component to the overall bridge system. The
   system fragility curves based on Monte Carlo simulation lie much closer
   to the upper bound fragilities given small correlation coefficients,
   implying that seismic demands of various components conditioned on the
   peak ground velocity are not correlated.}},

Abstract = {{An approach to numerically simulate ice accretion on 2D sections of a
   wind turbine blade is presented. The method uses standard commercial
   ANSYS-Fluent and Matlab tools. The Euler-Euler formulation is used to
   calculate the water impingement on the airfoil, and a UDF (Used Defined
   Function) has been devised to turn the airfoil's solid wall into a
   permeable boundary. Mayer's thermodynamic model is implemented in Matlab
   for computing ice thickness and for updating the airfoil contour. A
   journal file is executed to systematize the procedure: meshing, droplet
   trajectory calculation, thermodynamic model application for computing
   ice accretion, and the updating of airfoil contours. The proposed ice
   prediction strategy has been validated using iced airfoil contours
   obtained experimentally in the AMIL refrigerated wind tunnel (Anti-icing
   Materials International Laboratory). Finally, a numerical prediction
   method has been generated for anti-icing assessment, and its results
   compared with data obtained in this laboratory. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

   be stored, processed and analyzed offline. This paper presents a novel
   way of dealing with such huge trace data generation by introducing a
   Just-In-Time (JIT) filter based tracing system, for sieving through the
   flood of high frequency events, and recording only those that are
   relevant, when a specific condition is met. With a tiny filtering cost,
   the user can filter out most events and focus only on the events of
   interest. We show that in certain scenarios, the JIT compiled filters
   prove to be three times more effective than similar interpreted filters.
   We also show that with the increasing number of filter predicates and
   context variables, the benefits of JIT compilation increase with some
   JIT compiled filters being even three times faster than their
   interpreted counterparts. We further present a new architecture, using
   our filtering system, which can enable co-operative tracing between
   kernel and process tracing VMs (virtual machines) that share data
   efficiently. We demonstrate its use through a tracing scenario where the
   user can dynamically specify syscall latency through the userspace
   tracing VM whose effect is reflected in tracing decisions made by the
   kernel tracing VM. We compare the data access performance on our shared
   memory system and show an almost 100 times improvement over traditional
   data sharing for co-operative tracing.}},

Title = {{Micropollutant Removal Potential by Aged Powdered Activated Carbon}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The main objective of this study is to present a first demonstration of
   the potential of aged powdered activated carbon (PAC) to remove
   micropollutants during batch tests. Three PACs of varying ages (0, 10,
   and 60days) were added (1g/L) in settled and preozonated settled water,
   in which a mixture of 10 micropollutants had been spiked at
   environmentally relevant concentrations. Under these operating
   conditions, direct competition with natural organic matter was not
   evidenced when decreasing absorbability of the organic matter through
   ozonation. All the micropollutants were rapidly adsorbed on the three
   PACs, and removals superior to 95\% were reached within 5min of contact
   time for all the micropollutants investigated. PAC aging decreased the
   adsorption kinetics of atrazine, deethylatrazine, and caffeine. PAC age
   is thus expected to reduce significantly the process performance at
   contact times less than 15min. This study demonstrates that aged PAC
   suspensions allowing the removal of ammonia and dissolved organic carbon
   also have the potential to efficiently remove a wide variety of
   micropollutants by adsorption and comply with current World Health
   Organization guideline values for microcystin-LR (1g/L) and atrazine
   (2g/L).}},

Journal = {{INFORMATION PROCESSING \& MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{52}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Web users often have a specific goal in mind comprising various stages
   that are reflected, as executed, by their mouse cursor movements.
   Therefore, is it possible to detect automatically which parts of those
   movements bear any intent and discard the parts that have no intent? Can
   we estimate the intent degree of the non-discarded parts? To achieve
   this goal, we tap into the Kinematic Theory and its associated
   Sigma-Lognormal model (EAM). According to this theory, the production of
   a mouse cursor movement requires beforehand the instantiation of an
   action plan. The EAM models such an action plan as a sequence of
   strokes' velocity profiles, one stroke at a time, providing thus a
   reconstruction of the original mouse cursor movement. When a user intent
   is clear, the pointing movement is faster and the cursor movement is
   reconstructed almost perfectly, while the reverse is observed when the
   user intent is unclear.
   We analyzed more than 10,000 browsing sessions comprising about 5
   million of data points, and compared different segmentation techniques
   to detect discrete cursor chunks that were then reconstructed with the
   EAM. Our main contribution is thus a novel methodology to automatically
   tell chunks with and without intention apart. We also contribute with
   kinematic compression, a novel application to compress mouse cursor data
   while preserving most of the original information. Ultimately, this work
   enables a deeper understanding of mouse cursor movements production,
   providing an informed means to gain additional insight about users'
   browsing behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{135}},
Pages = {{1503-1513}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Creativity workshops (i.e. brainstorming, creativity contests and design
   jams) are increasingly being used by organisations to explore new design
   spaces and find original ideas for new products or services. The
   selection of ideas resulting from these creative processes is a key
   activity for a firm, as it serves as a foundation for time management
   and decisions on further investments. Moreover, the selection of
   promising ideas has a more significant impact than the creative process
   itself as it colours the overall innovation process. We argue that this
   type of decision is strongly context dependent. That is, the selection
   process is conditioned by several factors such as the firm's
   technological and organisational capabilities and its strategy. This
   implies that a relevant idea for a particular company is not necessarily
   relevant for another. This paper proposes a context formalisation
   approach, supported by multi-criteria decision-making analysis tools to
   evaluate ideas resulting from a creative workshop. This evaluation
   process seeks to assist the decision-making by requiring success
   criteria to take into account the firm's context and priorities and give
   decision-makers the keys to establish a coherent evaluation.
   Implementation of this approach during a creative workshop validates the
   appeal of this type of contextualised evaluation. It contributes to the
   field of practical application of ideas in productive environments. The
   proposed methodology is illustrated through a case study on the new
   eco-tourism services for the city of Leticia in the Amazonian region of
   Colombia with a view to sustainable development. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL THERMAL AND FLUID SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{249-253}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Gas heat capacity, C-p, is a fundamental extensive thermodynamic
   property depending on molecular transitional, vibrational and rotational
   energy. Empirical four-parameter polynomials approximate the sigmoidal
   C-p trends for temperatures up to 1500 K and adding parameters extends
   the range. However, the fitted parameters have no physical significance
   and diverge beyond their range at high temperature. Here we propose an
   exponential expression for C-p whose fitted parameters relate to the
   shape of the C-p versus T curve and to molecular properties: C-p =
   C-p(0) + C-p(infinity) {[}1 + ln((T) under bar)(1 + T-i/T)] exp(-T-i/T).
   It accounts for more than 99\% of the variance with a deviation of
   similar to 1\% from 298 K to 6000 K for linear C-1-C-7 hydrocarbons and
   N-2, H2O, O-2, C2H4, H-2, CO, and CO2. We also provide an integrated
   form for enthalpy and an approximation to calculate entropy variations.
   This model replaces empirical polynomials with an expression whose
   constants are meaningful. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents two-stage bi-objective stochastic programming models
   for disaster relief operations. We consider a problem that occurs in the
   aftermath of a natural disaster: a transportation system for supplying
   disaster victims with relief goods must be established. We propose
   bi-objective optimization models with a monetary objective and
   humanitarian objective. Uncertainty in the accessibility of the road
   network is modeled by a discrete set of scenarios. The key features of
   our model are the determination of locations for intermediate depots and
   acquisition of vehicles. Several model variants are considered. First,
   the operating budget can be fixed at the first stage for all possible
   scenarios or determined for each scenario at the second stage. Second,

Title = {{A heuristic optimization of Bayesian incentive-compatible cake-cutting}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& OPERATIONS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{76-82}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Cake-cutting is a metaphor for problems where a principal agent has to
   fairly allocate resources. Such problems cover various areas of
   operations research and management science, like, for instance, shift
   scheduling with employees' preferences. Recent work focuses on
   optimizing social efficiency while guaranteeing fairness, but ignore
   incentive-compatibility constraints, or vice versa. In this paper, we
   present a new approach to heuristic mechanism design with Bayesian
   incentive-compatibility. As opposed to other papers, we do not allow
   monetary transfer. Our approach relies on the revelation principle and
   the computation of Bayesian-Nash equilibria using the so-called return
   function. This computation consists in tracking a best-reply dynamics of
   return function, which are mappings of action to probability
   distribution on outcomes, instead of the more classical but
   harder-to-compute best-reply dynamics of strategies. In essence, our
   mechanism-design approach explores a parameterized class of revelation
   mechanisms, which we know by construction to be Bayesian
   incentive-compatible. We highlight the efficiency of this approach
   through numerical results on instances of respectively 2, 5 and 20
   agents. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{OCT 27}},
Abstract = {{Myoelectric prostheses aim to help amputees to experience partial
   function of the absent organ. The sensors usually used to control the
   prostheses are surface electromyography (sEMG) electrodes, of which the
   number tends to increase with the increase of the number of degrees of
   freedom in the recent prostheses, i.e. dozens of sensors today. However,
   sEMG requires a high sampling frequency, traditionally about 1000 Hz,
   which drastically limits the number of sensors that the processors can
   manage. The objective is to develop a device enabling to measure muscle
   contractions (MCs) with a sampling frequency compared with the movement
   frequencies. Strain gauges are known for their accuracy, so using them
   to detect MCs could help to predict the movement intentions of the
   amputee. The designed devise includes the integration of four strain
   gauges in silicone rubber that is similar to human skin. The reliability
   of the sensor results is demonstrated by a comparison with Ag/AgCl
   electrodes of an electromyography system. The correlation coefficient is
   very high (0.89) between the tensions measured by the sEMG and the
   strain gauges. So the advantage of a low sampling frequency compared
   with sEMG is the potential development of matrices with many strain
   gauges.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{A series of encapsulated and nonencapsulated bulk heterojunction
   photovoltaic devices containing poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and
   {[}6,6] -phenyl C-61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) with different
   P3HT:PCBM ratios were investigated using traditional steady-state as
   well as non steady-state intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy
   (IMPS) techniques. The steady state J-V measurements showed that PCBM
   content did not have a significant effect on the efficiency for freshly
   prepared devices, whereas aged nonencapsulated devices exhibited a
   strong dependence on PCBM content. IMPS measurements showed a
   significant contribution of interfacial nongeminate recombination in
   nonencapsulated devices, which increased with decreasing PCBM content in
   the photoactive layer and cell aging. It was related to the formation of
   interfacial states at the P3HT/PCBM interface due to atmospheric
   contamination, which act as recombination centers. Device encapsulation
   was found to be effective in preventing the occurrence of interfacial
   recombination. Our results suggest that IMPS can be used as a diagnostic
   tool to predict the performance of bulk heterojunction organic solar
   cells. If a solar cell shows the presence of interfacial states as
   indicated by semicircle arcs in quadrant I of the IMPS complex plane
   plots, it is most likely that its performance will deteriorate with time
   due to enhanced interfacial recombination, even without further exposure
   to atmospheric contaminations. We conclude that interfacial nongeminate
   recombination is an important degradation mechanism in organic solar
   cells, especially in the case of exposure to atmospheric contaminants.}},

Title = {{Comparable Cerebral Oxygenation Patterns in Younger and Older Adults
   during Dual-Task Walking with Increasing Load}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{The neuroimaging literature on dual-task gait clearly demonstrates
   increased prefrontal cortex (PFC) involvement when performing a
   cognitive task while walking. However, findings from direct comparisons
   of the cerebral oxygenation patterns of younger (YA) and older (OA)
   adults during dual-task walking are mixed and it is unclear how YA and
   OA respond to increasing cognitive load (difficulty) while walking. This
   functional near infra-red (fNIRS) study examined cerebral oxygenation of
   YA and OA during self-paced dual-task treadmill walking at two different
   levels of cognitive load (auditory n-back). Changes in accuracy (\%) as
   well as oxygenated (HbO) and deoxygenated (HbR) hemoglobin were
   examined. For the HbO and HbR measures, eight regions of interest (ROls)
   were assessed: the anterior and posterior dorsolateral and ventrolateral
   PFC (aDLPFC, pDLPFC, aVLPFC, pVLPFC) in each hemisphere. Nineteen YA (M
   = 21.83 years) and 14 OA (M = 66.85 years) walked at a self-selected
   pace while performing auditory 1-back and 2-back tasks. Walking alone
   (single motor: SM) and performing the cognitive tasks alone (single
   cognitive: SC) were compared to dual-task walking (DT = SM + SC). In the
   behavioural data, participants were more accurate in the lowest level of
   load (1-back) compared to the highest (2-back; p < 0.001). YA were more
   accurate than OA overall (p = 0.009), and particularly in the 2-back
   task (p = 0.048). In the fNIRS data, both younger and older adults had
   task effects (SM < DT) in specific ROls for A HbO (three YA, one OA) and
   Delta HbR (seven YA, eight OA). After controlling for walk speed
   differences, direct comparisons between YA and OA did not reveal
   significant age differences, but did reveal a difficulty effect in HbO
   in the left aDLPFC (13 = 0.028) and significant task effects (SM < DT)
   in HbR for six of the eight ROls. Findings suggest that YA and OA
   respond similarly to manipulations of cognitive load when walking on a
   treadmill at a self-selected pace.}},

Journal = {{WEAR}},

Volume = {{364}},

Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Cavitation erosion is a leading cause of hydraulic machinery erosion:
   imploding cavitation bubbles cause impacts, pitting, and mass loss
   leading to the component's failure. Damage can be mitigated by the use
   of protective coatings tailored to resist pitting and crack nucleation,
   to greatly increase the part's lifetime. Coatings deposited with the
   High Velocity Oxy-Fuel (HVOF) process demonstrate low porosity, high
   hardness and high adhesion. In this work, the cavitation erosion
   behavior of martensitic and ferritic stainless steels and HVOF coatings
   prepared from pure Fe3Al powder and Fe3Al reinforced with nitride and
   boride phases was investigated using the G32 vibratory setup. The
   results are compared with coatings sprayed from commercial powders:
   WC-CoCr and Cr3C2-NiCr. HVOF coatings exhibit slightly lower erosion
   rates than martensitic stainless steels. The mechanical properties were
   evaluated using depth sensing indentation: higher hardness was
   associated with better cavitation erosion resistance for steels, but not
   for the coatings. The composite coatings' wear mechanisms followed a
   matrix erosion pattern accompanied by ceramic grain removal. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The market share of building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) remains
   limited. One of the main barriers to its larger adoption is its initial
   capital cost, as BIPV is generally more expensive than traditional roof
   or fa cade mounted photovoltaic modules(PV). Converting BIPV systems
   into BIPV with thermal energy recovery (BIPV-T) can improve its benefit
   and competitiveness compared to other solar energy technologies. This
   benefit is difficult to estimate, however, as it strongly depends on the
   usefulness of the thermal energy produced and the incremental cost of
   the technology to recover the heat. This study aims at evaluating the
   cost-benefit of BIPV-T focusing on systems that use air as the heat
   recovery fluid and are integrated into all-electric energy-efficient
   homes located in heating dominated climates. This cost-benefit is
   evaluated using the concept of break-even cost defined as the maximum
   incremental cost to convert a BIPV system into a BIPV-T system to
   break-even with the cost of (a) a BIPV system and (b) side-by-side PV
   modules and solar thermal collectors (PV + T). To obtain this cost, the
   useful equivalent energy production of BIPV, BIPV-T and PV + T systems
   was first obtained for six energy-efficient housing archetypes located
   in various cities across Canada. Four different heat management
   scenarios were considered for the BIPV-T system: (1) fresh air
   preheating, (2) domestic hot water preheating through an air-to water
   heat exchanger, (3) domestic hot water and space heating with an
   air-to-water heat pump and (4) domestic hot water heating (DHW) with a
   heat pump water heater. Compared to BIPV, BIPV-T systems always produce
   more useful energy and as a result, the break-even cost compared to a
   BIPV system was found to be always positive and up to 2700 CAD for a
   medium 2-storey home located in Montreal. For that same house and
   considering the price of BIPV equal to that of standard roof-mounted PV
   modules, the break-even cost of a BIPVT system compared to a PV + T
   system was estimated at 4200 CAD. If the price of BIPV were to get 10\%
   lower than PV, however, this break-even cost could increase to 6400 CAD.

Abstract = {{A new analytical proof is presented for steady-state seepage in
   recharged heterogeneous unconfined aquifers. The paper also presents a
   detailed procedure and important rules for performing correctly
   numerical studies of unsaturated seepage. Once a numerical solution is
   calibrated with field data, using a set of spatially distributed values
   for hydraulic conductivity K and effective infiltration EI, any new
   numerical analysis with a set of K and EI values, where is a constant,
   yields an equally good calibration. However, if the effective porosities
   of each layer are unchanged, the groundwater velocities are multiplied
   by , whereas the travel times are divided by , which may help to select
   in order to match known travel time data. This is a clear example of
   multiple solutions to an inverse problem. The paper underlines the role
   and the need to finely mesh unsaturated zones and also contacts between
   layers to reach the asymptotic convergence range, as it was carried out
   to verify the proof and as it should be completed to study any seepage
   problem. A few consequences of the new analytical proof and the rigorous
   procedure are shown with examples. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Hypercapnic-calibrated fMRI allows the estimation of the relative
   changes in the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (rCMRO(2)) from
   combined BOLD and arterial spin labelling measurements during a
   functional task, and promises to permit more quantitative analyses of
   brain activity patterns. The estimation relies on a macroscopic model of
   the BOLD effect that balances oxygen delivery and consumption to predict
   haemoglobin oxygenation and the BOLD signal. The accuracy of calibrated
   fMRI approaches has not been firmly established, which is limiting their
   broader adoption. We use our recently developed microscopic vascular
   anatomical network model in mice as a ground truth simulator to test the
   accuracy of macroscopic, lumped-parameter BOLD models. In particular, we
   investigate the original Davis model and a more recent heuristic
   simplification. We find that these macroscopic models are inaccurate
   using the originally defined parameters, but that the accuracy can be
   significantly improved by redefining the model parameters to take on new
   values. In particular, we find that the parameter a that relates
   cerebral blood-volume changes to cerebral blood-flow changes is
   significantly smaller than typically assumed and that the optimal value
   changes with magnetic field strength. The results are encouraging in
   that they support the use of simple BOLD models to quantify BOLD
   signals, but further work is needed to understand the physiological
   interpretation of the redefined model parameters.

   between cognitive and cellular neuroscience'.}},

   ({[}N-4444]{[}DEHP]), a room temperature ionic liquid (IL), as an
   aqueous collector for flotation of model monazite and bastnasite
   minerals was investigated through micro-flotation tests, zeta potential
   measurements, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The ionic liquid was shown to have
   superior performance to float both model rare-earth (RE) minerals as
   compared with calcite, dolomite and quartz minerals as typical gangue
   minerals. Parallel to this, micro-flotation tests of a rare-earth ore
   containing bastnasite and monazite minerals were found in line with
   {[}N-4444]{[}DEHP] stronger collecting power towards RE model minerals
   even outperforming hydroxamic acid-containing collectors. With regard to
   the mineral surface chemistry, zeta potential measurements, FTIR
   characterization and XPS analysis, it was established that
   {[}N-4444]{[}DEHP] uptake on bastnasite and monazite surfaces was via
   chemisorption involving specifically the P=0 and P-O groups of the IL
   anionic moiety. IL anionic and cationic interactions during RE mineral
   flotation were rationalized in terms of an inner synergistic pathway: IL
   anionic moiety chemisorbing on bastnasite and monazite surfaces
   prompting uptake of cationic moiety via electrostatic attraction and/or
   via hydrophobic chain interactions of the cation alkyl chains with the
   chemisorbed IL anionic layer. Finally, for calcite as the most
   responsive among gangue minerals, the characterization techniques
   divulged the weaker IL-surface interactions. Hence, this investigation
   opens up new prospects for more selective ionic-liquid collectors to be
   used in the flotation of RE minerals. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Comparison of different cardiovascular magnetic resonance sequences for
   native myocardial T1 mapping at 3T}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{OCT 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: T1 mapping based on cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)
   is a novel approach using the magnetic relaxation T1 time as a
   quantitative marker for myocardial tissue composition. Various T1
   mapping sequences are being used, with different strengths and
   weaknesses. Data comparing different sequences head to head however are
   sparse.
   Methods: We compared three T1 mapping sequences, ShMOLLI, MOLLI and
   SASHA in phantoms and in a mid-ventricular slice of 40 healthy
   individuals (mean age 59 +/- 7 years, 45 \% male) with low (68 \%) or
   moderate cardiovascular risk. We calculated global and segmental T1 in
   vivo through exponential curve fitting and subsequent parametric
   mapping. We also analyzed image quality and inter-observer
   reproducibility.
   Results: There was no association of T1 with cardiovascular risk groups.
   T1 however differed significantly depending on the sequence, with SASHA
   providing consistently higher mean values than ShMOLLI and MOLLI (1487
   +/- 36 ms vs. 1174 +/- 37 ms and 1199 +/- 28 ms, respectively; p <
   0.001). This difference between sequences was much smaller in phantom
   measurements. In patients, segmental values were lower in the anterior
   wall for all sequences. Image quality, in general good for the
   steady-state-free-precession readouts in all sequences, was lower for
   SASHA parametric maps. On multivariate regression analysis, a longer T1
   measured by MOLLI was correlated with lower ejection fraction and female
   gender. Inter-observer variability as assessed by intra-class
   correlation coefficients was excellent for all sequences (ShMOLLI:
   0.995; MOLLI: 0.991; SASHA: 0.961; all p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: In a cross-sectional population with low to moderate
   cardiovascular risk, we observed a variation in T1 mapping results
   between inversion-recovery vs. saturation-recovery sequences in vivo,
   which were less evident in phantom images, despite a small interobserver
   variability. Thus, physiological factors, most likely related to B1
   inhomogeneities, and tissue-specific properties, like magnetization
   transfer, that impact T1 values in vivo, render phantom validation
   insufficient, and have to be further investigated for a better
   understanding of the clinical utility of different T1 mapping
   approaches.}},

Abstract = {{By maintaining a balance between external mechanical loads and internal
   osmotic pressure, fluid content of intervertebral discs constantly
   alters causing fluctuations in disc hydration, height, diameter and
   pressure that govern disc temporal response. This paper reviews and
   discusses the relevant findings of earlier studies on the disc fluid
   flow with the aim to understand and remedy discrepancies between in vivo
   and in vitro observations. New results of finite element model studies
   are also exploited in order to help identify the likely causes for such
   differences and underlying mechanisms observed in vitro.
   In vivo measurements of changes in spinal height and disc fluid
   content/pressure via stadiometry, magnetic resonance imaging and
   intradiscal pressure measurements have been carried out. They have
   demonstrated that the disc volume, fluid content, height and nucleus
   pressure alter depending to a large extent on prior-current external
   load conditions. Although the diurnal loading lasts on average nearly
   twice longer than the subsequent resting (16 vs. 8 h), the disc
   completely recovers its height and volume during the latter period
   through fluid inflow. In view of much longer periods required to recover
   disc height and pressure in vitro in ovine, porcine, caprine, bovine and
   rat discs, concerns have been raised on the fluid inflow through the
   endplates that might be hampered by clogged blood vessels post mortem.
   Analyses of discrepancies in the flow-dependent recoveries in vivo and
   in vitro highlight an excessive fluid content in the latter as a likely
   cause. To replicate in vivo conditions as closely as possible in vitro,
   preparation and preconditioning of specimens and/or pressure and
   osmolarity of the culture media in which specimens are immersed should
   hence be designed in a manner as to diminish disc hydration level and/or
   fluid transport. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Subject-specific parameters influence spinal loads and the risk of back
   disorders but their relative effects are not well understood. The
   objective of this study is to investigate the effects of changes in age
   (35-60 years), sex (male, female), body height (BH: 150-190 cm) and body
   weight (BW: 50-120 kg) on spinal loads in a full-factorial simulation
   using a personalized (spine kinematics, geometry, musculature and
   passive properties) kinematics driven musculoskeletal trunk finite
   element model. Segmental weight distribution (magnitude and location
   along the trunk) was estimated by a novel technique to accurately
   represent obesity. Five symmetric sagittal loading conditions were
   considered, and main effect plots and analyses of variance were employed
   to identify influential parameters. In all 5 tasks simulated, BW (98.9\%
   in compression and 96.1\% in shear) had the greatest effect on spinal
   loads at the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels followed by sex (0.7\% in
   compression and 2.1\% in shear), BH (0.4\% in compression and 1.5\% in
   shear) and finally age (<5.4\%). At identical BH and BW, spinal loads in
   females were slightly greater than those in males by similar to 4.7\% in
   compression and similar to 8.7\% in shear. In tasks with no loads in
   hands, BW-normalized spinal loads further increased with BW highlighting
   the exponential increase in spinal loads with BW that indicates the
   greater risk of back disorders especially in obese individuals. Uneven
   distribution of weight in obese subjects, with more BW placed at the
   lower trunk, further (though slightly < 7.5\%) increased spinal loads.

Abstract = {{In most countries, basic research is supported by research councils that
   select, after peer review, the individuals or teams that are to receive
   funding. Unfortunately, the number of grants these research councils can
   allocate is not infinite and, in most cases, a minority of the
   researchers receive the majority of the funds. However, evidence as to
   whether this is an optimal way of distributing available funds is mixed.
   The purpose of this study is to measure the relation between the amount
   of funding provided to 12,720 researchers in Que `bec over a 15-year
   period (19982012) and their scientific output and impact from 2000 to
   2013. Our results show that in terms of both the quantity of papers
   produced and their scientific impact, the concentration of research
   funding in the hands of the so-called `elite' of researchers generally
   produces diminishing marginal returns. Also, we find that the most
   funded researchers do not stand out in terms of output and scientific
   impact.}},

   artillery shell and simulation results were in close agreement with
   experimental measurements. The model is equipped with a CZM function to
   account for adhesion between the solidified cast and the mold. During
   cooling, separation is possible and the size and location of gaps,
   depending on shrinkage and adhesion, are successfully emulated. The

Abstract = {{In some coastal regions of the Arctic Ocean, grounded ice ridges
   contribute to stabilizing and maintaining a landfast ice cover.
   Recently, a grounding scheme representing this effect on sea ice
   dynamics was introduced and tested in a viscous-plastic sea ice model.
   This grounding scheme, based on a basal stress parameterization,
   improves the simulation of landfast ice in many regions such as in the
   East Siberian Sea, the Laptev Sea, and along the coast of Alaska.
   Nevertheless, in some regions like the Kara Sea, the area of landfast
   ice is systematically underestimated. This indicates that another
   mechanism such as ice arching is at play for maintaining the ice cover
   fast. To address this problem, the combination of the basal stress
   parameterization and tensile strength is investigated using a 0.25
   degrees Pan-Arctic CICE-NEMO configuration. Both uniaxial and isotropic
   tensile strengths notably improve the simulation of landfast ice in the
   Kara Sea but also in the Laptev Sea. However, the simulated landfast ice
   season for the Kara Sea is too short compared to observations. This is
   especially obvious for the onset of the landfast ice season which
   systematically occurs later in the model and with a slower build up.
   This suggests that improvements to the sea ice thermodynamics could
   reduce these discrepancies with the data.}},

Abstract = {{The design provisions for seismically isolated bridges in the CAN/CSA-S6
   Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code and the AASHTO Guide Specifications
   for Seismic Isolation Design (AASHTO 2010, 2014) have been developed
   primarily based on ground motions recorded along the west coast of North
   America. Both codes include a simplified analysis procedure that relies
   on an equivalent effective linearization of the nonlinear isolated
   structure together with damping coefficients to account for the effect
   of energy dissipation on the response of the isolated system. The
   appropriateness and range of application of code-specified simplified
   methods were investigated through nonlinear time-history analyses to
   propose improvements to this procedure for the new edition of the
   CSA-S6-2014 code. Based on these analyses, new damping coefficients are
   proposed for Eastern North America (ENA) and new limits for the
   application of the simplified method are defined. For ENA, the method
   with newly proposed damping coefficients can give good bridge
   displacement estimates for equivalent damping ratios of up to 40\%,
   which broadens the possible designs that can be achieved using the
   simplified method. This study also showed that applicability limits
   could be defined more accurately as a function of the system properties.}},

Abstract = {{Fitness is known to have beneficial effects on brain anatomy and
   function. However, the understanding of mechanisms underlying immediate
   and long-term neurophysiological changes due to exercise is currently
   incomplete due to the lack of tools to investigate brain function during
   physical activity. In this study, we used time-domain near infrared
   spectroscopy (TD-NIRS) to quantify and discriminate extra-cerebral and
   cerebral hemoglobin concentrations and oxygen saturation (SO2) in young
   adults at rest and during incremental intensity exercise. In
   extra-cerebral tissue, an increase in deoxy-hemoglobin (HbR) and a
   decrease in SO2 were observed while only cerebral HbR increased at high
   intensity exercise. Results in extra-cerebral tissue are consistent with
   thermoregulatory mechanisms to dissipate excess heat through skin blood
   flow, while cerebral changes are in agreement with cerebral blood flow
   (CBF) redistribution mechanisms to meet oxygen demand in activated
   regions during exercise. No significant difference was observed in
   oxy-(HbO(2)) and total hemoglobin (HbT). In addition HbO(2), HbR and HbT
   increased with subject's peak power output (equivalent to the maximum
   oxygen volume consumption; VO2 peak) supporting previous observations of
   increased total mass of red blood cells in trained individuals. Our
   results also revealed known gender differences with higher hemoglobin in
   men. Our approach in quantifying both extra-cerebral and cerebral
   absolute hemoglobin during exercise may help to better interpret past
   and future continuous-wave NIRS studies that are prone to extra-cerebral
   contamination and allow a better understanding of acute cerebral changes
   due to physical exercise. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, mode composite waveguide (MCW) is proposed, which
   consists of inner and outer wave-guiding duo structures. The outer
   structure acts as a rectangular coaxial line suitable for lower
   frequency operation for its compact size, while the inner structure
   works as a rectangular waveguide suitable for higher frequency operation
   thanks to its simple structure and low loss. The MCW can propagate
   signals in the inner waveguide with TE10 mode and/or the outer waveguide
   with TEM mode depending on frequency to achieve optimal performance for
   both low-and high-frequency operations. In this paper, the fundamental
   waveguide parameters and higher order modes of the duo waveguides are
   examined. The proposed MCW prototypes are fabricated on a triple-layer
   PCB structure using the emerging substrate integration techniques. The
   MCW is fabricated and measured through the proposed microstrip line to
   the inner and outer waveguide transitions, and an MCW simultaneous
   feeding circuit is also presented. For this simultaneous feeding
   circuit, the good matching is achieved from 7.5 to 10.5 GHz for the
   low-frequency operation and from 25 to 39 GHz for the high-frequency
   operation, respectively.}},

Title = {{Structure Dependence of Lysosomal Transit of Chitosan-Based Polyplexes

Abstract = {{Chitosan-based polyplexes are known to traffic through lysosomes for a
   relatively long time, independent of the degree of deacetylation (DDA)
   and the number average molecular weight (Mn) of the polymer, even though
   both of these parameters have profound effects on polyplex stability and
   transfection efficiency. A better understanding of the lysosomal barrier
   is paramount to the rational design of vectors capable of overcoming
   obstacles to transgene expression. The aim of the present study was to
   investigate if lysosomal transit affects chitosan-based polyplex
   transfection efficiency in a structure-dependent (DDA, Mn) manner.
   Toward this end, we analyzed the effects of intracellular trafficking
   modifying agents on transfection efficiency and intracellular vesicular
   trafficking of polyplexes with different structural properties and
   stabilities or nucleic acid binding affinity. The use of agents that
   modify endosome/lysosome acidification and transit processes by distinct
   mechanisms and their effect on cell viability, polyplex uptake,
   vesicular trafficking, and transfection efficiency revealed novel and
   strong chitosan structure-dependent consequences of lysosomal transit.
   Inhibiting lysosomal transit using chloroquine significantly increased
   the efficiency of unstable polyplexes, while having minimal effects for
   polyplexes with intermediate or high stability. In parallel,
   specifically inhibiting the acidification of vesicles abrogated
   transfection for all formulations, suggesting that vesicular
   acidification is essential to promote transfection, most probably by
   facilitating lysosomal escape. These results provide novel insights into
   the structure-performance relationship of chitosan-based gene delivery
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this two-part paper is to provide clarity to physical
   concepts used in the field of transformer modeling, to dispel common
   misconceptions regarding numerical instabilities, and to present unified
   modeling techniques for low-frequency transients. This paper focuses on
   proper modeling of nonlinearities (magnetizing branches) since these
   components are critical to determine the low-frequency behavior. A good
   low-frequency model should properly represent: normal operation, inrush
   currents, open and short circuit, out-of-phase synchronization transient
   of step-up transformers, geomagnetic-induced currents, ferroresonance,
   and harmonics. This paper discusses the derivation of electrical dual
   models from the equivalent (magnetic) reluctance networks and the direct
   application of the principle of duality. It is shown that different dual
   models need to be derived for different transformer geometries and the
   advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed. This paper
   also compares double-sided versus single-sided dual models, and shows
   that the double-sided model is a more general approach. The mathematical
   equivalency of several leakage models (negative inductance, mutual
   coupling, and BCTRAN) is demonstrated for three-winding transformers. It
   is also shown that contrary to common belief, a negative inductance is
   not the source of numerical oscillations, but they occur due to the use
   of noncorrect topological models for representing the core.}},

Abstract = {{This two-part paper is intended to clarify definitions in dual
   transformer modeling that are vague, provide accurate modeling
   guidelines, clarify misconceptions about numerical instability, provide
   a unified dual model for a specific type of transformer, and introduce
   new paths of research to the power systems/electrical machinery
   community for low-frequency transients. Part I discussed the topology of
   duality-based models and some important issues, such as the most common
   approaches to derive dual models and their variety, the equivalence of
   negative inductance and mutual couplings to represent the leakage
   inductance of three-winding transformers, and the numerical oscillations
   caused by the use of nontopological models. This part of the paper
   discusses and compares white-, gray-, and black-box models. The paper
   also reviews hysteresis models (static and dynamic) and highlights the
   differences between the air-core inductance and saturation inductance.
   The available dual models for the representation of the transformer tank
   are then presented. A unified and accurate model of a three-phase
   core-type transformer adequate for all low frequency transients is
   presented. Finally, concrete guidelines are presented for the
   appropriate selection of the model topology and parameters for different
   low-frequency transient studies.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the reasons for the irregular structure of
   primary graphite nodules that were formed in a hypereutectic cast iron
   powder during water atomization. The graphite nodules contain a
   significant amount of micron-sized pores and multiple nanometric voids
   that formed from silicon oxide bifilms. The bifilms theory is often used
   to explain the mechanisms responsible for the presence of pores in
   castings. However, even if many results presented in the literature tend
   to corroborate the existence of bifilms, to this date, only indirect
   evidences of their existence were presented. The observations presented
   in this paper are the first to show the double-sided nature of these
   defects. These observations support the bifilms theory and give an
   explanation for the presence of porosities in castings. The bifilms were
   used as substrate for graphite growth during solidification. The
   irregular structure of the graphite nodules is a consequence of the
   rather random structure of the bifilms that were introduced in the melt
   as a result of turbulences on the surface of the melt during pouring.
   The confirmation of the existence of bifilms can contribute to the
   understanding of the mechanical properties of various metallic parts.}},

Abstract = {{Polaritons are quasiparticles that form in semiconductors when an
   elementary excitation such as an exciton or a phonon interacts
   sufficiently strongly with light. In particular, exciton-polaritons have
   attracted tremendous attention for their unique properties, spanning
   from an ability to undergo ultra-efficient four-wave mixing to
   superfluidity in the condensed state. These quasiparticles possess
   strong intrinsic nonlinearities, while keeping most characteristics of
   the underlying photons. Here we review the most important features of
   exciton-polaritons in microcavities, with a particular emphasis on the
   emerging technological applications, the use of newmaterials for
   room-temperature operation, and the possibility of exploiting polaritons
   for quantum computation and simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Detecting latency-related problems in production environments is usually
   carried out at the application level with custom instrumentation. This
   is enough to detect high latencies in instrumented applications but does
   not provide all the information required to understand the source of the
   latency and is dependent on manually deployed instrumentation. The
   abnormal latencies usually start in the operating system kernel because
   of contention on physical resources or locks. Hence, finding the root
   cause of a latency may require a kernel trace. This trace can easily
   represent hundreds of thousands of events per second. In this paper, we
   propose and evaluate a methodology, efficient algorithms, and concurrent
   data structures to detect and analyze latency problems that occur at the
   kernel level. We introduce a new kernel-based approach that enables
   developers and administrators to efficiently track latency problems in
   production and trigger actions when abnormal conditions are detected.
   The result of this study is a working scalable latency tracker and an
   efficient approach to perform stateful tracing in production. Copyright

Abstract = {{Titanium metal matrix composite (Ti-MMC) is a relatively new class of
   material, which has high potential applications in the aeronautical and
   biomedical sectors. Similar to titanium alloys, Ti-MMC produces
   segmented chips, which are characterized by adiabatic shear bands (ASB).
   Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) observations were performed and
   dislocations were observed on the atomic scale. Furthermore, the sheared
   surfaces, as well as the effects of the hard TiC particles on the ASB
   formation were investigated. It was shown that the grains located in the
   lightly strained areas within the chip segment are characterized by a
   high dislocation density. This is contrary to the highly strained areas
   inside the ASB, where the temperature was estimated to be close to the
   recrystallization temperature. Analysis of the results showed that no
   phase transformation took place inside the ASB. The strain and strain
   rate in the ASB were estimated to reach 7.5 and 4.5 x 10(5) s(-1),
   respectively. Using TEM and Focused Ion Beam (FIB) for sample
   preparation, the microstructure inside the ASB was found to be composed
   of elongated and equiaxed nano-sized grains. The segmentation mechanism
   of chips was observed to start from a crack on the material free surface
   ahead of the tool, and not at the tool tip. Furthermore, the hard
   particles inside the matrix were found not to be hindering, or retarding
   the ASB formation. A micro structural evolution model, based on these
   observations, has also been proposed. To the authors' best knowledge,
   TEM studies of ASB for Ti-MMC were never done previously for machining
   applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{943-958}},

Abstract = {{Most of the reported prognostic techniques use a small number of
   condition indicators and/or use a thresholding strategies in order to
   predict the remaining useful life (RUL). In this paper, we propose a
   reliability-based prognostic methodology that uses condition monitoring
   (CM) data which can deal with any number of condition indicators,
   without selecting the most significant ones, as many methods propose.
   Moreover, it does not depend on any thresholding strategies provided by
   the maintenance experts to separate normal and abnormal values of
   condition indicators. The proposed prognostic methodology uses both the
   age and CM data as inputs to estimate the RUL. The key idea behind this
   methodology is that, it uses Kaplan-Meier as a time-driven estimation
   technique, and logical analysis of data as an event-driven diagnostic
   technique to reflect the effect of the operating conditions on the age
   of the monitored equipment. The performance of the estimated RUL is
   measured in terms of the difference between the predicted and the actual
   RUL of the monitored equipment. A comparison between the proposed
   methodology and one of the common RUL prediction technique; Cox
   proportional hazard model, is given in this paper. A common dataset in
   the field of prognostics is employed to evaluate the proposed
   methodology.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{91-92}},

Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{The widespread proliferation of Internet and wireless applications has
   produced a significant increase of ICT energy footprint. As a response,
   in the last years, significant efforts have been undertaken to include
   energy-awareness into network management. Several green networking
   frameworks consisting in carefully managing the network routing and the
   power state of network devices have been proposed.
   Even though the approaches differ on the technologies and sleep modes
   adopted, they all aim at tailoring the active network resources to the
   varying traffic needs in order to minimize energy consumption. From a
   modeling standpoint, this has several commonalities with classical
   network design and routing problems, even if with different objectives
   and in a dynamic context.
   While most research has focused on crucial technological aspects of the
   green networking schemes, there has been little attention so far on the
   understanding of the modeling similarities and differences of the
   proposed solutions. This paper fills the gap by surveying the literature
   on wired networks energy management with optimization modeling glasses.
   It follows a tutorial approach that guides through the different
   components of the models with a unified symbolism. A detailed
   classification of previous work based on the included modeling issues is
   also proposed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   growth of cyanobacteria in the source water that were correlated with
   cyanobacterial biovolumes from taxonomic counts (r = 0.59, p < 0.00001).
   A strong correlation was observed between the cyanobacterial
   concentrations in the lake water and in the well water as measured by
   the phycocyanin probe (p < 0.001, 0.73 <= r(2) <= 0.94). Log removals
   from bank filtration estimated from taxonomic counts ranged from 0.96
   +/- (0.5) and varied according to the species of cyanobacteria. Of
   cyanobacteria that passed through bank filtration, smaller cells were
   significantly more frequent in well water samples (p < 0.05) than larger
   cells. Travel times from the lakes to the wells were estimated as 2 days
   for Lake B and 10 days for Lake A. Cyanobacterial species in the wells
   were most closely related to species found in Lake B. Thus, a travel
   time of less than 1 week permitted the breakthrough of cyanobacteria to
   wells. Winter samples demonstrated that cyanobacteria accumulate within
   bank filters, leading to continued passage of cells beyond the bloom
   season. Although no concentrations of total microcystin-LR were above
   detection limits in filtered well water, there is concern that
   cyanobacterial cells that reach the wells have the potential to contain
   intracellular toxins. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The two-echelon vehicle routing problem (2E-VRP) consists in making
   deliveries to a set of customers using two distinct fleets of vehicles.
   First-level vehicles pick up requests at a distribution center and bring
   them to intermediate sites. At these locations, the requests are
   transferred to second-level vehicles, which deliver them. This paper
   addresses a variant of the 2E-VRP that integrates constraints arising in
   city logistics such as time window constraints, synchronization
   constraints, and multiple trips at the second level. The corresponding
   problem is called the two-echelon multiple-trip vehicle routing problem
   with satellite synchronization (2E-MTVRP-SS). We propose an adaptive
   large neighborhood search to solve this problem. Custom destruction and
   repair heuristics and an efficient feasibility check for moves have been
   designed and evaluated on modified benchmarks for the VRP with time
   windows. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   silicon oxide and nitride surfaces functionalized with self-assembled
   monolayers of ( 3-mercaptopropyl)-trimethoxysilane. First, we compare
   both solution and vapour-phase functionalization techniques and find the
   greatest improvement in electrical and optical properties using
   deposition from solution. Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we
   demonstrate that the formation of silver-sulfur covalent bonds is at the
   root of the improved wetting confirmed by ellipsometry, sheet resistance
   measurement, and atomic force microscopy. Second, we show that this
   technique can be extended to functionalize silicon nitride. Finally, we
   demonstrate a simple, but efficient, low-emissivity optical filter.

Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP 8}},
Abstract = {{Chrestenson generalized Walsh transform factorizations for parallel
   processing imbedded implementations on field programmable gate arrays
   are presented. This general base transform, sometimes referred to as the
   Discrete Chrestenson transform, has received special attention in recent
   years. In fact, the Discrete Fourier transform and Walsh-Hadamard
   transform are but special cases of the Chrestenson generalized Walsh
   transform. Rotations of a base-p hypercube, where p is an arbitrary
   integer, are shown to produce dynamic contention-free memory allocation,
   in processor architecture. The approach is illustrated by factorizations
   involving the processing of matrices of the transform which are function
   of four variables. Parallel operations are implemented matrix
   multiplications. Each matrix, of dimension N x N, where N = p(n), n
   integer, has a structure that depends on a variable parameter k that
   denotes the iteration number in the factorization process. The level of
   parallelism, in the form of M = p(m) processors can be chosen
   arbitrarily by varying m between zero to its maximum value of n - 1. The
   result is an equation describing the generalised parallelism
   factorization as a function of the four variables n, p, k and m.
   Applications of the approach are shown in relation to configuring field
   programmable gate arrays for digital signal processing applications.}},

Abstract = {{Periodic structures, acting as reflectors, filters, and couplers, are a

   characteristics of an out-of-plane grating coupler are studied in
   detail, and its coupling efficiency is examined. Furthermore, a
   numerical calibration analysis is applied through a commercial software
   package on the basis of a full-wave finite-element method to calculate
   the complex propagation constant of the structure and to evaluate the
   radiation pattern. For experimental evaluation, an optimized grating
   coupler is fabricated using electron-beam lithography technique and
   plasma etching. An excellent agreement between simulations and
   measurements is observed, thereby validating the demonstrated method.

Abstract = {{The chest radiograph is an essential tool for the diagnosis of several
   lung diseases in intensive care units (ICU). However, several factors
   make the interpretation of the chest radiograph difficult including the

   and the lack of a standardized interpretation. To overcome these
   limitations in the interpretation of chest radiographs, researchers have
   developed computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. In this review, the
   authors report the methodology used to develop CAD systems including
   identification of the region of interest, analysis of these regions, and
   classification. Currently, only a few CAD systems for chest X-ray
   interpretation are commercially available. Some promising research is
   ongoing, but the involvement of the pediatric research community is

   mixtures with near-monochromatic radiation from a Kr lamp, or by
   low-pressure r.f. plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD).
   Varying the gas mixture ratio, R, allows one to control the films'
   sulfur content as well as the thiol concentration {[}-SH]. The deposits
   were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), before and
   after chemical derivatization with N-ethylmaleimide, and by ATR FTIR.
   VUV- and plasma-prepared coatings were found to possess very similar
   structures and characteristics, showing chemically bonded sulfur
   concentrations, {[}S], up to 48 at\% and {[}-SH] up to 3\%. All coatings
   remained essentially unchanged in thickness after immersion in water for
   24 h.}},

Abstract = {{Polyurethanes (PUs) are composed of soft and hard segments, and
   segmental interactions induce biphasic morphologies which can infl uence
   endothelial cell (EC) organization by regulating cell-matrix and
   cell-cell interactions. In this study, we explored this effect using
   poly(caprolactone) (PCL)-based PU, where the soft segment was composed
   of PCL and the hard segment was composed of hexamethylene diisocyanate
   (HDI) and L-tyrosine-based dipeptide (DTH). The composition of the PUs
   was varied by altering the PCL molecular weight and correspondingly,
   different phase morphologies were observed. Organization and functional
   state of ECs on these PUs showed that composition and phase morphology
   of PU have a significant effect on cellular response. The ECs formed an
   organized network with cord-like structures which resulted in
   interconnected loops when soft and hard segment fractions were
   phase-separated. VE-cadherin (for cell-cell adherence) and vinculin (for
   cell-matrix focal adhesion) localized at the tip of interconnecting
   cells in the tube structures indicated synchronized cell-cell and

Abstract = {{The 3-D integrated circuits (3-D ICs) are emerging as a viable solution
   to enhance the performance of many-core platforms. These architectures
   generate a high and rapidly changing thermal flux that makes
   conventional air-cooled devices more susceptible to overheating. Liquid
   cooling is an alternative that can improve dissipation and reduce
   thermal issues. Fast and accurate thermal models are needed to
   appropriately dimension the cooling system at design time. Several
   models have been proposed to study different designs, but generally with
   low simulation performance. In this paper, we present an efficient model
   of the transient thermal behavior of liquid-cooled 3-U ICs. This paper
   presents an approach with extremely low memory usage and advanced
   numerical methods to efficiently compute the transient temperature of
   3-U ICs. Our experiments show the 100x speedup versus the
   state-of-the-art models, while maintaining the same level of accuracy,
   and demonstrate the efficiency of liquid cooling to remove the heat from
   3-U many-core platforms.}},

Volume = {{65}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a new block coding scheme to increase the
   diversity gain of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal
   frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems over slow-fading wireless
   channels. We assume that the antenna elements at the transmitter are
   reconfigurable and capable of independently changing the physical
   characteristics of their radiation patterns. The composite right-left
   handed leaky-wave antenna is an example of reconfigurable antennas with
   such characteristics. We use this feature of the antennas and develop a
   block coding scheme that exploits, in addition to the spatial and
   frequency diversity, a new additional degree of diversity, which is
   called state diversity. We determine the maximum achievable diversity
   order of the proposed coding scheme in spatially correlated
   frequency-selective channels. To demonstrate the performance of the
   proposed block coding technique, we provide numerical results and
   compare them with those of the previously developed coding schemes for
   MIMO-OFDM systems. The results indicate that the proposed code achieves
   significantly higher diversity and coding gain, even in spatially
   correlated channels, compared with the existing counterparts.}},

Title = {{On the Use of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control without Parameter
   Adaptation for Batch Processes}},
Journal = {{PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Optimization techniques are typically used to improve economic
   performance of batch processes, while meeting product and environmental
   specifications and safety constraints. Offline methods suffer from the
   parameters of the model being inaccurate, while re-identification of the
   parameters may not be possible due to the absence of persistency of
   excitation. Thus, a practical solution is the Nonlinear Model Predictive
   Control (NMPC) without parameter adaptation, where the measured states
   serve as new initial conditions for the re-optimization problem with a
   diminishing horizon. In such schemes, it is clear that the optimum
   cannot be reached due to plant-model mismatch. However, this paper goes
   one step further in showing that such re-optimization could in certain
   cases, especially with an economic cost, lead to results worse than the
   offline optimal input. On the other hand, in absence of process noise,
   for small parametric variations, if the cost function corresponds to
   tracking a feasible trajectory, re-optimization always improves
   performance. This shows inherent robustness associated with the tracking
   cost. A batch reactor example presents and analyzes the different cases.
   Re-optimizing led to worse results in some cases with an economical cost
   function, while no such problem occurred while working with a tracking
   cost.}},

Abstract = {{Air traffic in Europe is predicted to increase considerably over the
   next decades. In this context, we present a study of the interactions
   between the costs due to ground-holding regulations and the costs due to
   en-route air traffic control. We dulator that considers the regulation
   delays, aircraft trajectories, and air conflict resolution. Through
   intensive simulations based on traffic forecasts extrapolated from
   French traffic data for 2012, we compute the regulation delays and
   avoidance maneuvers according to two scenarios: the current regulations
   and no regulations. The resulting cost analysis highlights the
   exponential growth in regulation costs that can be expected if the
   procedures and the airspace capacity do not change. Compared to the
   delay costs, the costs of the air traffic control are negligible with or
   without regulation. The analysis reveals the heavy controller workloads
   when there are no regulations, suggesting the need for regulations that
   are appropriate for large traffic volumes and an improved ATC system.
   These observations motivate the design of a third scenario that computes
   the sector capacities to find a compromise between the increase in the
   delay costs due to ground-holding regulations and the increase in the
   controller workload. The results reveal the sensitivity of the delay
   costs to the sector capacity; this information will be useful for
   further research into ATM sector capacity and ATC automated tool design.
   Finally, because of the growing interest in the free flight paradigm, we
   also perform a traffic and cost analysis for aircraft following direct
   routes. The results obtained highlight the fuel and time savings and the
   spatial restrictions that companies use to avoid congested areas. (C)

Abstract = {{This letter presents a multilayer approach for suppressing the higher

   Rectangular SIW resonators in multilayer substrates can be vertically
   coupled with magnetic and/or electric coupling by the proposed apertures

   first higher-order mode TE102 can be suppressed thanks to the proposed
   weak coupling or mixed coupling schemes in connection with the TE102
   mode. Compared with conventional horizontally coupled filter, the
   proposed filters also show a compact physical size. To demonstrate the
   proposed design method, two double-layered SIW bandpass filters Filter
   (I and II) are fabricated and measured. The experimental results show
   that the maximum rejection levels at the TE102 mode frequencies are
   below -30 dB and -20 dB for Filter I and II, respectively. Furthermore,
   simulated and measured results also show a good agreement.}},

Abstract = {{A technique is proposed to generate a dual-beam and broad beamwidth
   radiation in the E-plane of a printed bow-tie antenna operating over

   constant of the antenna substrate using arrays of metamaterial
   inclusions realized using stub-loaded H-shaped unit cells to provide a
   high index of refraction. The H-shaped inclusions are tilted with
   respect to the axis of the antenna and embedded in the direction of the
   end-fire radiation. The resulting dual-beam radiation in the E-plane has
   maxima at +60 degrees and 120 degrees with respect to the end-fire
   direction (90 degrees), with a maximum peak gain of 9 dBi at 60 GHz.}},

Title = {{Delay of Rotating Stall in Compressors Using Plasma Actuators}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TURBOMACHINERY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Rotating stall is a well-known aerodynamic instability in compressors
   that limits the operating envelope of aircraft gas turbine engines. An
   innovative method for delaying the most common form of rotating stall
   inception using an annular dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma
   actuator had been proposed. A DBD plasma actuator is a simple
   solid-state device that converts electricity directly into flow
   acceleration through partial air ionization. However, the proposed
   concept had only been preliminarily evaluated with numerical simulations
   on an isolated axial rotor using a relatively basic CFD code. This paper
   provides both an experimental and a numerical assessment of this concept
   for an axial compressor stage as well as a centrifugal compressor stage,
   with both stages being part of a low-speed two-stage axial-centrifugal
   compressor test rig. The two configurations studied are the two-stage
   configuration with a 100 mN/m annular casing plasma actuator placed just
   upstream of the axial rotor leading edge (LE) and the single-stage
   centrifugal compressor with the same actuator placed upstream of the
   impeller LE. The tested configurations were simulated with a commercial
   RANS CFD code (ANSYS CFX) in which was implemented the latest
   engineering DBD plasma model and dynamic throttle boundary condition,
   using single-passage multiple blade row computational domains. The
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations indicate that in both
   types of compressors, the actuator delays the stall inception by pushing
   the incoming/tip clearance flow interface downstream into the blade
   passage. In each case, the predicted reduction in stalling mass flow
   matches the experimental value reasonably well.}},

Abstract = {{The bonemorphogenetic proteins (BMPs), which are involved in bone
   formation and repair, play an important role in tissue engineering. For
   example, BMP-9 and BMP-2, which are members of different BMP
   subfamilies, are osteoinductive factors. However, several studies have
   recently shown that BMP-9 is more osteogenic than BMP-2. We have
   previously shown that fetal bovine serum (FBS) strongly enhances the
   osteoblast differentiation of murine preosteoblasts (MC3T3-E1) to BMP-9
   but not to BMP-2. This effect is mimicked by IGF-2, which primarily
   activates the PI3K/Akt pathway, but how Akt phosphorylation sites are
   implicated in such differentiation is unclear. The effects of BMP-9 and
   BMP-2 with or without FBS or IGF-2 on Akt phosphorylation sites and
   subsequent osteoblastic differentiation were determined, respectively,
   by western blot analysis and alkaline phosphatase activity measurements.
   The involvement of phosphorylated Akt at Thr308 and/or Ser473 on
   BMP-mediated osteoblast differentiation was further studied using
   specific inhibitors. In MC3T3-E1 incubated with or without FBS, BMP-9
   and BMP-2 activate Akt on Ser473 and Thr308 very differently in a time
   and dose-dependent manner. Using inhibitors specific to each Akt
   phosphorylation site, we showed that both Ser473 and Thr308 must be
   phosphorylated for BMP-9 and/or IGF-2-induced osteoblast
   differentiation, whereas BMP-2 requires phosphorylation of only Ser473.
   Furthermore, cells stimulated with BMP-2 in the presence of FBS require
   the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 and the dephosphorylation of Akt at
   Thr308 to increase the osteoblast differentiation with alkaline
   phosphatase activity similar to that of BMP-9 plus FBS. These results
   provide a better understanding into how BMP-9 induces osteoblast
   differentiation and its synergy with IGF-2 at the signaling level. This
   knowledge is essential for preparing the serum-free osteogenic media
   required for bone tissue engineering or developing growth factor
   delivery systems to improve bone formation.}},

Abstract = {{Intrinsic material skills have a deep effect on the mechanical and
   biological performance of bone substitutes, as well as on its associated
   biodegradation properties. In this work we have manipulated the
   preparation of collagenous derived fiber mesh frameworks to display a
   specific composition, morphology, open macroporosity, surface roughness
   and permeability characteristics. Next, the effect of the induced
   physicochemical attributes on the scaffold's mechanical behavior, bone
   bonding potential and biodegradability were evaluated. It was found that
   the scaffold microstructure, their inherent surface roughness, and the
   compression strength of the gelatin scaffolds can be modulated by the
   effect of the cross-linking agent and, essentially, by mimicking the
   nano-scale size of hydroxyapatite in natural bone. A clear effect of
   bioactive hydroxyapatite nano-rods on the scaffolds skills can be
   appreciated and it is greater than the effect of the cross-linking
   agent, offering a huge perspective for the upcoming progress of bone
   implant technology. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Failure to recognize insular cortex seizures has recently been
   identified as a cause of epilepsy surgeries targeting the temporal,
   parietal, or frontal lobe. Such failures are partly due to the fact that
   current noninvasive localization techniques fare poorly in recognizing
   insular epileptic foci. Our group recently demonstrated that
   magnetoencephalography ( MEG) is sensitive to epileptiform spikes
   generated by the insula. In this study, we assessed the potential of
   distributed source imaging and functional connectivity analyses to
   distinguish insular networks underlying the generation of spikes.
   Nineteen patients with operculo- insular epilepsy were investigated.
   Each patient underwent MEG as well as T1-weighted magnetic resonance
   imaging ( MRI) as part of their standard presurgical evaluation.
   Cortical sources of MEG spikes were reconstructed with the maximum
   entropy on the mean algorithm, and their time courses served to analyze
   source functional connectivity. The results indicate that the anterior
   and posterior subregions of the insula have specific patterns of
   functional connectivity mainly involving frontal and parietal regions,
   respectively. In addition, while their connectivity patterns are
   qualitatively similar during rest and during spikes, couplings within
   these networks are much stronger during spikes. These results show that
   MEG can establish functional connectivity-based signatures that could
   help in the diagnosis of different subtypes of insular cortex epilepsy.

Title = {{Hyperthermia of magnetic nanoparticles allows passage of sodium

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The blood retina barrier (BRB) is a biological barrier
   consisting of tightly interconnected endothelial cells inside the
   retinal vascular network that protects the neural tissue from harmful
   pathogens and neurotoxic molecules circulating in the bloodstream.
   Unfortunately, with regard to retinoblastoma, this barrier also prevents
   systemically administered therapeutics reaching the retinal tissue. In
   this study we introduce a novel technique to locally and transiently
   increase BRB permeability for drug delivery using hyperthermia of
   magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs).
   Materials and methods: An alternating current (AC) magnetic field was
   used to induce hyperthermia of locally injected MNPs in the left
   ophthalmic artery of a rat model. To improve adherence on the surface of
   the endothelium, commercially available MNPs coated with human
   transferrin glycoproteins were used. After hyperthermia we assessed the
   extravasation of systemically injected sodium fluorescein (NaF) as well
   as Evans blue dye (EBD) into the retinal tissue.
   Results: Spectrofluorometry and fluorescent microscopy image analysis
   show a significant increase of dye penetration in the retina where
   hyperthermia of MNPs was applied.
   Conclusions: Our proposed new technique can allow both small and large
   dye molecules to cross the BRB. While the results are preliminary and
   thorough evaluation of the retinal tissue following hyperthermia is
   necessary, this technique has the potential to be an effective mean for
   the treatment of various diseases such as retinoblastoma.}},

Abstract = {{The accurate description of the mechanical properties of spinal cord
   tissue benefits to clinical evaluation of spinal cord injuries and is a
   required input for analysis tools such as finite element models.
   Unfortunately, available data in the literature generally relate
   mechanical properties of the spinal cord under quasi-static loading
   conditions, which is not adapted to the study of traumatic behavior, as
   neurological tissue adopts a viscoelastic behavior. Thus, the objective
   of this study is to describe mechanical properties of the spinal cord up
   to mechanical damage, under dynamic loading conditions. A total of 192
   porcine cervical to lumbar spinal cord samples were compressed in a
   transverse direction. Loading conditions included ramp tests at 0.5, 5
   or 50s(-1) and cyclic loading at 1, 10 or 20Hz. Results showed that
   spinal cord behavior was significantly influenced by strain rate.
   Mechanical damage occurred at 0.64, 0.68 and 0.73 strains for 0.5, 5 or
   50s(-1) loadings, respectively. Variations of behavior between the
   tested strain rates were explained by cyclic loading results, which
   revealed behavior more or less viscous depending on strain rate. Also, a
   parameter (stress multiplication factor) was introduced to allow
   transcription of a stress-strain behavior curve to different strain
   rates. This factor was described and was significantly different for
   cervical, thoracic and lumbar vertebral heights, and for the strain
   rates evaluated in this study.}},

Title = {{Distance between rotator cuff footprints and the acromion,

   elevations: Preliminary observations}},
Journal = {{MANUAL THERAPY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{Background: The objective of this study was to provide preliminary
   measures of the distance between the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and
   subscapularis footprints and the acromion, coracoacromial ligament, and
   coracoid process, during dynamic arm elevations through the entire
   range-of-motion.
   Methods: Two healthy men performed maximum adduction, flexion,
   abduction, and extension with the arm internally, neutrally, and
   externally rotated. The distance between each rotator cuff footprint and
   the acromion, coracoacromial ligament, and coracoid process was measured
   from glenohumeral kinematics obtained from markers fitted to
   intracortical pins combined with the scapular and humeral 3D geometry
   obtained from CT-scan.
   Results: All footprints moved to be less than 10 mm to the acromion,
   coracoacromial ligament and coracoid process. They got closer to the
   acromion than to the other parts of the coracoacromial arch. The
   acromion-supraspinatus and acromion-infraspinatus distances were minimal
   during abduction and flexion. The acromion-subscapularis distance was
   minimal when the arm was in external and neutral rotation during both
   adduction and flexion.
   Conclusions: The present study provides benchmark results of the
   distance between the rotator cuff footprints and the coracoacromial arch
   that may guide future clinical research. Pressure transducers should be
   positioned throughout the coracoacromial arch to provide comprehensive
   assessment of the compression undergone by the rotator cuff tendons.
   Common shoulder examination tests, that require flexion and internal
   rotation movements, may be refined since the supraspinatus footprint was
   the closest to the coracoacromial arch during abduction. Larger scale
   investigations may be needed to identify more accurate shoulder
   examination tests. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Based upon the experimental data available in the literature and present
   measurements, thermodynamic reassessments were initially performed on
   the binary BaO-ZrO2, BaO-YO1.5 systems, and the resultant thermodynamic
   parameters were then merged in combination with that of the previous
   ZrO2-YO1.5 system to derive a self-consistent thermodynamic description
   for the ZrO2-BaO-YO1.5 ternary system with limited ternary thermodynamic
   parameters. The Gibbs energies of all the liquid and terminal solid
   solution phases were treated by the substitutional solution model, the
   BZ phase featured by second solid solution described by the compound
   energy formalism (CEF) model, and the stoichiometric compound BZY424 and
   Ba2YZrO6-d modeled following the Neumann-Kopp rule. The calculated
   results agree well with the isothermal sections at 1600 degrees C and
   1750 degrees C (1873 K and 1923 K) from both of the previous and present
   measured phase diagrams. This demonstrates that the thermodynamic
   parameters derived in the present work could be applicable to
   compositional optimizations of novel refractories for melting titanium
   alloys on the basis of this ternary oxide system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd

Abstract = {{Wave propagation and transients associated to intersheath modes on
   normal-bonded and cross-bonded cables are the main topic of this paper.
   Intersheath mode characteristics are not easily identified in practice
   using the standard circuits for field testing of normal-bonded cables
   because the source grounding introduces several overlapping modal
   components. The differences between cross-bonded and normal-bonded
   cables are highlighted based on the propagation characteristics of the
   two systems. In particular, inter-core mode propagation is substantially
   affected by the cross-bonding of sheaths. Discrete and homogeneous
   models of a cross-bonded cable are compared in a time-domain simulation.
   The accuracy of the homogeneous model improves when the number of sheath
   grounding points is high. It is clearly shown that even though
   intersheath modes cannot be excited in a cross-bonded cable they can
   still be induced by the currents in the core conductors and have an
   impact on the cable's transient response. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The VSC-based HVDC link between France and Spain (INELFE project:
   France-Spain ELectrical INterconnection) is currently the most powerful
   VSC link. This 2000 MW interconnection is composed of two parallel VSC
   links'. For system studies and maintenance purposes, the replicas of the
   control systems have been acquired by the French (RTE) and the Spanish
   (REE) Transmission System Operators. This paper describes the hardware
   and software setup to perform Hardware In the Loop (HIL) simulations
   with the INELFE control system replicas. The converter and cable models
   used in the real-time simulation are presented. Modular Multilevel
   Converters present a major challenge for real-time simulation due to the
   large number of sub-modules and to the nonlinearities that shall be
   solved: transformer saturation and nonlinear characteristic of surge
   arresters that protect cables against switching transients. The paper
   presents how these issues have been solved in order to be able to test
   the control system with AC and DC faults. It is shown that iterative
   methods are used to provide accurate solutions in the presence of
   nonlinear devices but are not mandatory in this specific case. A
   complete setup has been developed in order to validate the modeling
   approach. HIL simulations have been performed with the real-time
   simulator connected to an external generic control system having the
   same interface than the replica. Real-time performance and simulation
   accuracy are fully achieved with the proposed solution. This solution
   has been used to interface the real-time simulator with the real control
   cubicles. The converter model is validated with on-site measurements.

Abstract = {{HVDC link interconnections under construction or planned in France are
   part of a highly meshed ac network. This is a relatively new operating
   condition. The impact of their operation and the risk of abnormal
   interaction may have an influence on the ac network. The use of voltage
   source converters (VSCs) with the modular multilevel converter (MMC)
   topology is becoming more attractive mainly due to their higher
   performances and lower cost. This paper analyses the operation and
   interaction of,MMC-HVDC links embedded in an ac grid. First a MMC-HVDC
   link model suitable for small-signal analysis is presented. This
   small-signal HVDC model is then validated against an EMT-type model for
   ac systems having different SCR (Short-Circuit Ratio) values. Modal
   analysis and parametric studies are performed in order to study the
   impact of an ac line connected in parallel with an HVDC link. (C) 2016

Title = {{Form drag effect on the onset of non-linear convection and Hopf
   bifurcation in binary fluid saturating a tall porous cavity}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{178-190}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports a numerical study of natural convection in at all
   porous enclosure filled with a binary fluid. The Darcy-Dupuis model,
   which includes effects of the form drag force, is adopted to describe
   the flow in the porous medium. The two vertical walls of the cavity are
   subject to constant gradients of temperature while the two horizontal
   ones are kept adiabatic and impermeable. Concentration gradients are
   assumed to be induced either by the imposition of constant gradients of
   solute on the vertical walls of the system (a = 0; double diffusive
   convection) or by the Soret effect (a = 1). Governing parameters of the
   problem under study are the thermal Rayleigh number R-T, form drag
   parameter G, buoyancy ratio phi, Lewis number. Le, normalized porosity
   epsilon, and aspect ratio of the cavity A. The case of equal and
   opposing thermal and solutal buoyancy forces, phi = -1, is considered.
   For this situation, an equilibrium solution corresponding to the rest
   state is possible and the resulting onset of motion can be either
   supercritical or subcritical. A semi-analytical solution, valid for an
   infinite layer (A >> 1) assuming parallel flow, is derived. Based on the
   linear stability theory, the onset of motion from the rest state is
   predicted for both double diffusive and Soret convection. The onset of
   Hopf bifurcation, characterizing the transition from a convective steady
   state to oscillatory state, is also studied. The influence of the
   governing parameters on the onset of motion and the resulting fluid
   flow, temperature and concentration fields is discussed in detail. The
   existence of supercritical, subcritical and oscillatory convective modes
   is demonstrated. A good agreement is found between the predictions of
   the parallel flow approximation and the numerical results obtained by
   solving the full governing equations. The existence of multiple
   solutions and traveling waves for a given set of the governing parameter
   is demonstrated and leads to the existence of a bistability phenomenon.
   Overall, the form drag behaves as a stabilizing effect and is seen to
   affect considerably the onset of subcritical convection and Hopf
   bifurcation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{299}},

Abstract = {{Mango leaves contain high levels of phenolic compounds, such as
   mangiferin which have multiple antioxidant and pharmaceutical properties
   and great potential in nutraceutical, cosmetic and food applications. In
   the study reported here, mango leaf extracts were obtained using
   supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), pressurized liquid extraction
   (PLE) and enhanced solvent extraction (ESE). ESE and PLE gave higher
   global extraction yields (up to 37\%) than SFE using CO2 + 20\% ethanol
   (around 8\%). The addition of high concentrations of ethanol (50-100\%)
   to the CO2 enhanced the solubility of mango polyphenols and thus
   increased the global and mangiferin yields at relatively low flow rates
   (20-30 g/min). The scale-up of high pressure processes was studied from
   the laboratory scale (0.1 L) to the pilot-plant scale (5.0 L) by
   applying the mathematical model of Sovova and different similarity
   criteria. The results indicate that Sovova's model can satisfactorily
   predict the kinetic curves and the best similarity criterion was to keep
   a constant solvent mass flow-to-feed mass ratio Qm.d/M, which includes
   the extractor diameter (d). Kinetic and model analyses showed that the
   SFE of mango leaves is mainly limited by diffusion whereas the PLE and
   ESE processes are controlled by both convection and diffusional
   mechanisms. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   methodology toward green products}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{69-79}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Green products are increasingly becoming the center of attention for
   policy and decision makers worldwide not only because of environmental
   and eco-systems crisis but also to satisfy the current competitiveness
   in the markets. With this aim, it is highly attractive to count with
   mathematical tools that allow assessing the sustainability of the
   products. In this regard, fuzzy techniques have been broadly used in
   different studies due to uncertainty and vagueness associated with
   sustainability problems. However, these studies are mostly based on
   fuzzy rules generation which is time consuming and also can lead to
   redundancy and inaccuracy. In this study, we introduced a
   fuzzy-inference system to evaluate product/process sustainability
   (SAFT). The proposed method does not require generation of rules which
   simplifies the procedure and makes it more precise. Furthermore, fuzzy
   analytic hierarchy process accompanied by Shannon's entropy formula was
   employed to determine the relative importance of each element in the
   hierarchy. The methodology SAFT was compared with fuzzy rule-base
   technique and impressively pretty the same results were obtained. The
   method introduced in this paper was built as a user interface platform
   which can be used as a fuzzy expert system to facilitate the
   sustainability assessment of products/processes in different
   manufacturing industries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING-JOE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Month = {{AUG 30}},
Abstract = {{Debugging and profiling tools can alter the execution flow or timing,
   can induce heisenbugs and are thus marginally useful for debugging time
   critical systems. Software tracing, however advanced it may be, depends
   on consuming precious computing resources. In this study, the authors
   analyse state-of-the-art hardware-tracing support, as provided in modern
   Intel processors and propose a new technique which uses the processor
   hardware for tracing without any code instrumentation or tracepoints.
   They demonstrate the utility of their approach with contributions in
   three areas - syscall latency profiling, instruction profiling and
   software-tracer impact detection. They present improvements in
   performance and the granularity of data gathered with hardware-assisted
   approach, as compared with traditional software only tracing and
   profiling. The performance impact on the target system - measured as
   time overhead - is on average 2-3\%, with the worst case being 22\%.
   They also define a way to measure and quantify the time resolution
   provided by hardware tracers for trace events, and observe the effect of
   fine-tuning hardware tracing for optimum utilisation. As compared with
   other in-kernel tracers, they observed that hardware-based tracing has a
   much reduced overhead, while achieving greater precision. Moreover, the
   other tracing techniques are ineffective in certain tracing scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{In order to constrain the interpretation of seismic data from receiver
   functions and deep profiles of the crust beneath southern China
   (Cathaysia and Yangtze blocks), we have measured S-wave velocities (Vs)
   and splitting as a function of hydrostatic confining pressure up to 650
   MPa for 22 representative samples (i.e., granite, diorite, felsic gneiss
   and mylonite, amphibolite, schist, and marble) from the Yunkai
   metamorphic complex (China) that represent the crystalline basement
   beneath the region. The experimental data were combined with electron
   backscattering diffraction (EBSD) analysis of rock-forming minerals to
   constrain variations of V-p/V-s ratios and understand the origin of
   seismic anisotropy. The crusts beneath the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks
   have different average thicknesses (H = 35.4 +/- 63 km and 29.8 +/- 1.8
   km, respectively) but display almost the same Vp/Vs values (1.73 +/-
   0.08 and 1.74 +/- 0.04, respectively). These ratios correspond to an
   average of bimodally distributed granitic and gabbroic lithologies which
   are dominant, respectively, in the upper and lower crusts, instead a
   homogeneous andesitic composition of the overall crust. Positive and
   negative correlations between H and V-p/V-s occur in west and east parts
   of southern China, respectively. The negative correlation indicates
   basaltic underplating from a partially molten mantle wedge above the
   subducting Pacific plate into the southern China crust, whereas the
   positive correlation implies that much larger thinning strain has taken
   place in the high temperature mafic lower crust (high temperature) than
   in the low temperature felsic upper crust during Mesozoic-Cenozoic
   tectonic extension. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Hydrophobicity}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Abstract = {{Apple growers face new challenges to produce organic apples and now many
   cover orchards with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) nets to exclude
   insects, rather than spraying insecticides. However,
   rainwater-associated wetness favours the development of apple scabs,
   Venturia inaequalis, whose lesions accumulate on the leaves and fruit
   causing unsightly spots. Treating the nets with a superhydrophobic
   coating should reduce the amount of water that passes through the net.
   Here we treat HDPE and polyethylene terephthalate using photo-initiated
   chemical vapour deposition (PICVD). We placed polymer samples in a
   quartz tube and passed a mixture of H-2 and CO through it while a UVC
   lamp (254 nm) illuminated the surface. After the treatment, the contact
   angle between water droplets and the surface increased by an average of
   20 degrees. The contact angle of samples placed 70 cm from the entrance
   of the tube was higher than those at 45 cm and 20 cm. The PICVD-treated
   HDPE achieved a contact angle of 124 degrees. Nets spray coated with a
   solvent-based commercial product achieved 180 degrees but water ingress
   was, surprisingly, higher than that for nets with a lower contact angle.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{106}},
Pages = {{443-472}},

Abstract = {{Reduction of energy requirements in the process industries results in
   increased profitability and better environmental performance. Methods
   for heat exchanger network (HEN) retrofit are based on thermodynamic
   analysis and insights, numerical optimization, or combined approaches.
   Numerical optimization-based methods are highly complex and may not
   guarantee identification of the global optimum. Pinch analysis, which is
   an approach based on thermodynamic analysis and composite curves, is the
   most widely used in the industry. Its simplicity, the use of graphical
   tools, and the possibility for the user to interact at each step of the
   design process help identify solutions with consideration of practical
   feasibility. In the last few years, bridge analysis has been developed
   for HEN retrofit. It includes the following tools: (a) the definition of
   the necessary conditions to reduce energy consumption which are
   expressed in the bridge formulation, (b) a method for enumerating the
   bridges, (c) the representation of the flow rate of cascaded heat
   through each existing exchanger on the energy transfer diagram (ETD),
   and (4) the use of the Heat Exchanger Load Diagram (HELD) to identify a
   suitable HEN configuration corresponding to modifications. It has been
   shown that reducing energy consumption implies decreasing the flow rate
   of cascaded heat through the existing exchangers across the entire
   temperature range between the hot and cold utilities. The ETD shows all
   possibilities to reduce the flow rate of cascaded heat through a HEN.
   The objective of this paper is to link these tools with the composite
   curves and concepts from pinch analysis into a consistent method for HEN
   retrofit. First, the relations between the composite curves, the ETD and
   the HELD are described, and a method for HEN retrofit which Combines the
   insights from pinch analysis with the recently developed tools is
   proposed. Then the method is used to reduce energy consumption in three
   case studies. Comparison between results from pinch analysis and bridge
   analysis shows that the latter identifies supplementary solutions to
   save energy. The proposed synthesis fills a gap in pinch analysis, and
   its concepts can be helpful in the development of software for HEN
   retrofit. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This contribution addresses a confrontation between the experimental
   simulation of a rotor/stator interaction case initiated by structural
   contacts with numerical predictions made with an in-house numerical
   strategy. Contrary to previous studies carried out within the
   low-pressure compressor of an aircraft engine, this interaction is found
   to be non divergent: high amplitudes of vibration are experimentally
   observed and numerically predicted over a short period of time. An
   in-depth analysis of experimental data first allows for a precise
   characterization of the interaction as a rubbing event involving the
   first torsional mode of a single blade. Numerical results are in good
   agreement with experimental observations: the critical angular speed,
   the wear patterns on the casing as well as the blade dynamics are
   accurately predicted. Through out the article, the in-house numerical
   strategy is also confronted to another numerical strategy that may be
   found in the literature for the simulation of rubbing events: key
   differences are underlined with respect to the prediction of non-linear
   interaction phenomena. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Traumatic spinal cord contusions lead to loss of quality of life, but
   their pathomechanisms are not fully understood. Previous studies have
   underlined the contribution of the cerebrospinal fluid in spinal cord
   protection. However, it remains unclear how important the contribution
   of the cerebrospinal fluid is relative to other factors such as the
   white/gray matter ratio. A finite element model of the spinal cord and
   surrounding morphologic features was used to investigate the spinal cord
   contusion mechanisms, considering subarachnoid space and white/gray
   matter ratio. Two vertebral segments (T6 and L1) were impacted
   transversely at 4.5ms(-1), which demonstrated three major results:
   While the presence of cerebrospinal fluid plays a significant
   contributory role in spinal cord protection (compression percentage
   decreased by up to 19\%), the arachnoid space variation along the spine
   appears to have a limited (3\% compression decrease) impact.
   Differences in the white and gray matter geometries from lumbar to
   thoracic spine levels decrease spinal cord compression by up to 14\% at
   the thoracic level.
   Stress distribution in the sagittal spinal cord section was consistent
   with central cord syndrome, and local stress concentration on the
   anterior part of the spinal cord being highly reduced by the presence of
   cerebrospinal fluid.
   The use of a refined spinal cord finite element method showed that all
   the geometrical parameters are involved in the spinal cord contusion
   mechanisms. Hence, spinal cord injury criteria must be considered at
   each vertebral level.}},

Journal = {{IMAGE AND VISION COMPUTING}},

Volume = {{52}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We present techniques for improving performance driven facial animation,
   emotion recognition, and facial key-point or landmark prediction using
   learned identity invariant representations. Established approaches to
   these problems can work well if sufficient examples and labels for a
   particular identity are available and factors of variation are highly
   controlled. However, labeled examples of facial expressions, emotions
   and key-points for new individuals are difficult and costly to obtain.
   In this paper we improve the ability of techniques to generalize to new
   and unseen individuals by explicitly modeling previously seen variations
   related to identity and expression. We use a weakly-supervised approach
   in which identity labels are used to learn the different factors of
   variation linked to identity separately from factors related to
   expression. We show how probabilistic modeling of these sources of
   variation allows one to learn identity-invariant representations for
   expressions which can then be used to identity-normalize various
   procedures for facial expression analysis and animation control. We also
   show how to extend the widely used techniques of active appearance
   models and constrained local models through replacing the underlying
   point distribution models which are typically constructed using
   principal component analysis with identity-expression factorized
   representations. We present a wide variety of experiments in which we
   consistently improve performance on emotion recognition, markerless
   performance-driven facial animation and facial key-point tracking. (C)

Abstract = {{Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major complication of diabetes and a
   leading cause of blindness in the working-age population. Impaired
   blood-retinal barrier function leads to macular edema that is closely
   associated with the deterioration of central vision. We previously
   demonstrated that the neuronal guidance cue netrin-1 activates a program
   of reparative angiogenesis in microglia within the ischemic retina.
   Here, we provide evidence in both vitreous humor of diabetic patients
   and in retina of a murine model of diabetes that netrin-1 is metabolized
   into a bioactive fragment corresponding to domains VI and V of the
   full-length molecule. In contrast to the protective effects of
   full-length netrin-1 on retinal microvasculature, the VI-V fragment
   promoted vascular permeability through the uncoordinated 5B (UNC5B)
   receptor. The collagenase matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP-9), which is
   increased in patients with diabetic macular edema, was capable of
   cleaving netrin-1 into the VI-V fragment. Thus, MMP-9 may release
   netrin-1 fragments from the extracellular matrix and facilitate
   diffusion. Nonspecific inhibition of collagenases or selective
   inhibition of MMP-9 decreased pathological vascular permeability in a
   murine model of diabetic retinal edema. This study reveals that netrin-1
   degradation products are capable of modulating vascular permeability,
   suggesting that these fragments are of potential therapeutic interest
   for the treatment of DR.}},

Abstract = {{The inventory-routing problem (IRP) integrates two well-studied
   problems, namely, inventory management and vehicle routing. Given a set
   of customers to service over a multiperiod horizon, the IRP consists of
   determining when to visit each customer, which quantity to deliver in
   each visit, and how to combine the visits in each period into feasible
   routes such that the total routing and inventory costs are minimized. In
   this paper, we propose an innovative mathematical formulation for the
   IRP and develop a state-of-the-art branch-price-and-cut algorithm for
   solving it. This algorithm incorporates known and new families of valid
   inequalities, including an adaptation of the well-known capacity
   inequalities, as well as an ad hoc labeling algorithm for solving the
   column generation subproblems. Through extensive computational
   experiments on a widely used set of 640 benchmark instances involving
   between two and five vehicles, we show that our branch-price-and-cut
   algorithm clearly outperforms a state-of-the-art branch-and-cut
   algorithm on the instances with four and five vehicles. In this instance
   set, 238 were still open before this work and we proved optimality for
   54 of them.}},

Abstract = {{Combination of biplane fluoroscopy and CT-scan provides accurate 3D
   measurement of the acromiohumeral distance (AHD) during dynamic tasks.
   However, participants performed only two and six trials in previous
   experiments to respect the recommended radiation exposure per year. Our
   objective was to propose a technique to assess the AHD in 3D during
   dynamic tasks without this limitation. The AHD was computed from
   glenohumeral kinematics obtained using markers fitted to pins drilled
   into the scapula and the humerus combined with 3D bone geometry obtained
   using CT-scan. Four participants performed range-of-motion,
   daily-living, and sports activities. Sixty-six out of 158 trials
   performed by each participant were analyzed. Two participants were not
   considered due to experimental issues. AHD decreased with arm elevation.
   Overall, the smallest AHD occurred in abduction (1.1 mm (P1) and 1.2 mm
   (P2)). The smallest AHD were 2.4 mm (P1) and 3.1 mm (P2) during ADL. It
   was 2.8 mm (P1) and 1.1 mm (P2) during sports activities. The humeral
   head greater and lesser tuberosities came the nearest to the acromion.
   The proposed technique increases the number of trials acquired during
   one experiment compared to previous. The identification of movements
   maximizing AHD is possible, which may provide benefits for shoulder
   rehabilitation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands (VRPSD) consists in
   designing optimal routes to serve a set of customers with random demands
   following known probability distributions. Because of demand
   uncertainty, a vehicle may arrive at a customer without enough capacity
   to satisfy its demand and may need to apply a recourse to recover the
   route's feasibility. Although travel times are assumed to be
   deterministic, because of eventual recourses the total duration of a
   route is a random variable. We present two strategies to deal with
   route-duration constraints in the VRPSD. In the first, the duration
   constraints are handled as chance constraints, meaning that for each
   route, the probability of exceeding the maximum duration must be lower
   than a given threshold. In the second, violations to the duration
   constraint are penalized in the objective function. To solve the
   resulting problem, we propose a greedy randomized adaptive search
   procedure (GRASP) enhanced with heuristic concentration (HC). The GRASP
   component uses a set of randomized route-first, cluster-second
   heuristics to generate starting solutions and a variable-neighborhood
   descent procedure for the local search phase. The HC component assembles
   the final solution from the set of all routes found in the local optima
   reached by the GRASP. For each strategy, we discuss extensive
   computational experiments that analyze the impact of route-duration
   constraints on the VRPSD. In addition, we report state-of-the-art
   solutions for a established set of benchmarks for the classical VRPSD.}},

Title = {{Hidden Markov Model-based population synthesis}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{1-21}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Micro-simulation travel demand and land use models require a synthetic
   population, which consists of a set of agents characterized by
   demographic and socio-economic attributes. Two main families of
   population synthesis techniques can be distinguished: (a) fitting
   methods (iterative proportional fitting, updating) and (b) combinatorial
   optimization methods. During the last few years, a third outperforming
   family of population synthesis procedures has emerged, i.e., Markov
   process-based methods such as Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC)
   simulations. In this paper, an extended Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based
   approach is presented, which can serve as a better alternative than the
   existing methods. The approach is characterized by a great flexibility
   and efficiency in terms of data preparation and model training. The HMM
   is able to reproduce the structural configuration of a given population
   from an unlimited number of micro-samples and a marginal distribution.
   Only one marginal distribution of the considered population can be used
   as a boundary condition to ``guide{''} the synthesis of the whole
   population. Model training and testing are performed using the Survey on
   the Workforce of 2013 and the Belgian National Household Travel Survey
   of 2010. Results indicate that the HMM method captures the complete
   heterogeneity of the micro-data contrary to standard fitting approaches.
   The method provides accurate results as it is able to reproduce the
   marginal distributions and their corresponding multivariate joint
   distributions with an acceptable error rate (i.e., SRSME=0.54 for 6
   synthesized attributes). Furthermore, the HMM outperforms IPF for small
   sample sizes, even though the amount of input data is less than that for
   IPF. Finally, simulations show that the HMM can merge information
   provided by multiple data sources to allow good population estimates.

Abstract = {{Longitudinal growth of long bones and vertebrae occurs in growth plate
   cartilage. This process is partly regulated by mechanical forces, which
   are one of the underlying reasons for progression of growth deformities
   such as idiopathic adolescent scoliosis and early-onset scoliosis. This
   concept of mechanical modulation of bone growth is also exploited in the
   development of fusionless treatments of these deformities. However, the
   optimal loading condition for the mechanical modulation of growth plate
   remains to be identified. The objective of this study was to evaluate
   the effects of in vitro static versus dynamic modulation and of dynamic
   loading parameters, such as frequency and amplitude, on the mechanical
   responses and histomorphology of growth plate explants. Growth plate
   explants from distal ulnae of 4-week-old swines were extracted and
   randomly distributed among six experimental groups: baseline (), control
   (), static () and dynamic (). For static and dynamic groups, mechanical
   modulation was performed in vitro using an Indexed CartiGen bioreactor.
   A stress relaxation test combined with confocal microscopy and digital
   image correlation was used to characterize the mechanical responses of
   each explant in terms of peak stress, equilibrium stress, equilibrium
   modulus of elasticity and strain pattern. Histomorphometrical
   measurements were performed on toluidine blue tissue sections using a
   semi-automatic custom-developed MATLAB toolbox. Results suggest that
   compared to dynamic modulation, static modulation changes the strain
   pattern of the tissue and thus is more detrimental for tissue
   biomechanics, while the histomorphological parameters are not affected
   by mechanical modulation. Also, under dynamic modulation, changing the
   frequency or amplitude does not affect the biomechanical response of the
   tissue. Results of this study will be useful in finding optimal and
   non-damaging parameters for the mechanical modulation of growth plate in
   fusionless treatments.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) enables secondary networks to find and
   efficiently exploit spectrum opportunities. A key factor to design a DSA
   network is the spectrum sensing algorithms for multiple channels with
   multiple users. Multi-user cooperative channel sensing reduces the
   sensing time, and thus it increases transmission throughput. However, in
   a multi-channel system, the problem becomes more complex since the
   benefits of assigning users to sense channels in parallel must also be
   considered. A sensing schedule, indicating to each user the channel that
   it should sense at different sensing moments, must be thus created to
   optimize system performance. In this paper, we formulate the general
   sensing scheduling optimization problem and then propose several sensing
   strategies to schedule the users according to network parameters with
   homogeneous sensors. Later on, we extend the results to heterogeneous
   sensors and propose a robust scheduling design when we have traffic and
   channel uncertainty. We propose three sensing strategies, and, within
   each one of them, several solutions, striking a balance between
   throughput performance and computational complexity, are proposed. In
   addition, we show that a sequential channel sensing strategy is the one
   to be preferred when the sensing time is small, the number of channels
   is large, and the number of users is small. For all the other cases, a
   parallel channel sensing strategy is recommended in terms of throughput
   performance. We also show that a proposed hybrid sequential-parallel
   channel sensing strategy achieves the best performance in all scenarios
   at the cost of extra memory and computation complexity.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental and finite element study on water leakage through
   reinforced concrete structural elements is presented in the paper. A
   macroscopic probabilistic approach is used to predict structural
   transfer properties evolution induced by concrete cracking. In this
   model, material heterogeneity is taken into account by randomly
   distributing the mechanical elementary properties (tensile strength,
   cracking energy) over the computational mesh. Each finite element is
   considered as representative of a volume of heterogeneous material,
   whose mechanical behavior depends on its own volume. The parameters of
   the statistical distributions defining the elementary mechanical
   properties thus vary over the computational mesh element-by-element
   according to experimentally validated constitutive laws. Under a weak
   hydro-mechanical coupling assumption, the model considers that the
   mechanical cracking of a finite element induces loss of isotropy of its
   own permeability tensor. So, at the finite element level, the localized
   crack flow is smeared over the elementary volume. Its contribution is
   computed according to an experimentally enhanced parallel plates model.
   An experimental test, which studies the real-time water transmissivity
   evolution of reinforced concrete tiespecimens under uniaxial tensile
   loading, is numerically simulated. Constitutive hydro-mechanical
   parameters were calibrated in previous works for a given concrete
   formulation. So, in order to avoid of any adjustments in the model
   parameters, the reference experimental test was performed with the same
   concrete formulation as in previous phases of the research. Numerical
   results evidence that, once steelconcrete interface is properly treated,
   a probabilistic approach can lead to proper predictions of cracking and
   its effect on fluid leakage.}},

Abstract = {{Elevated manganese (Mn) in drinking water has been reported worldwide.
   While, naturally occurring Mn in groundwater is generally the major
   source, anthropogenic contamination by Mn-containing fungicides such as
   mancozeb may also occur. The main objective of this study was to examine
   factors associated with Mn and ethylenethiourea (ETU), a degradation
   product of mancozeb, in drinking water samples from villages situated
   near banana plantations with aerial spraying of mancozeb. Drinking water
   samples (n = 126) were obtained from 124 homes of women participating in
   the Infants' Environmental Health Study (ISA, for its acronym in
   Spanish), living nearby large-scale banana plantations. Concentrations
   of Mn, iron (Fe), arsenic (As), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd) and
   ethylenethiourea (ETU), a degradation product of mancozeb, were measured
   in water samples. Only six percent of samples had detectable ETU
   concentrations (limit of detection (LOD) = 0.15 mu g/L), whereas 94\% of
   the samples had detectable Mn (LOD = 0.05 mu g/L). Mn concentrations
   were higher than 100 and 500 mu g/L in 22\% and 7\% of the samples,
   respectively. Mn was highest in samples from private and banana farm
   wells. Distance from a banana plantation was inversely associated with
   Mn concentrations, with a 61.5\% decrease (95\% CI: 97.0, 26.0) in Mn
   concentrations for each km increase in distance. Mn concentrations in
   water transported with trucks from one village to another were almost
   1000 times higher than Mn in water obtained from taps in houses supplied
   by the same well but not transported, indicating environmental Mn
   contamination. Elevated Mn in drinking water may be partly explained by
   aerial spraying of mancozeb; however, naturally occurring Mn in
   groundwater, and intensive agriculture may also contribute. Drinking

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a method for finding a robust solution to the
   problem of joint product family and supply chain design. Optimizing
   product design and the supply chain network at the same time brings
   substantial benefits. However, this approach involves decisions that can
   generate uncertainties in the long term. The challenge is to come up
   with a method that can adapt to most possible environments without
   straying too far from the optimal solution. Our approach is based on the
   generation of scenarios that correspond to combinations of uncertain
   parameters within the model. The performance of designs resulting from
   these scenario optimizations are compared to the performance of each of
   the other design scenarios, based on their probability of occurrence.
   The proposed methodology will allow practitioners to choose a suitable
   design, from the most profitable to the most reliable.}},

Abstract = {{Following the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in Japan there is
   a worldwide interest in reducing uncertainties in seismic safety
   assessment of existing nuclear power plant (NPP). Within the scope of a
   Canadian refurbishment project of a CANDU 6 (NPP) put in service in
   1983, structures and equipment must sustain a new seismic demand
   characterised by the uniform hazard spectrum (UHS) obtained from a site
   specific study defined for a return period of 1/10,000 years. This UHS
   exhibits larger spectral ordinates in the high-frequency range than
   those used in design. To reduce modeling uncertainties as part of a
   seismic probabilistic safety assessment (PSA), Hydro-Quebec developed a
   procedure using ambient vibrations testing to calibrate a detailed 3D
   finite element model (FEM) of the containment and reactor building (RB).
   This calibrated FE model is then used for generating floor response
   spectra (FRS) based on ground motion time histories compatible with the
   UHS. Seismic fragility analyses of the reactor building (RB) and
   structural components are also performed in the context of a case study.
   Because the RB is founded on a large circular raft, it is possible to
   consider the effect of the seismic wave incoherency to filter out the
   high-frequency content, mainly above 10 Hz, using the incoherency
   transfer function (ITF) method. This allows reducing significantly the
   non-necessary conservatism in resulting FRS, an important issue for an
   existing NPP. The proposed case study, and related methodology using
   ambient vibration testing, is particularly useful to engineers involved
   in seismic re-evaluation of existing NPP. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{A multiscale gas/liquid flow model was developed as a tool for the
   design and scale-up of stirred tank reactors (STRs). The model is based
   on the compartmentalization of the STR into zones and the use of
   simplified less computationally intensive gas/liquid flow simulations.
   It predicts the mean value of the local volumetric mass transfer
   coefficient (k(L)a) in each compartment based on the local hydrodynamic
   parameters therein (i.e., gas hold-up and liquid turbulent energy
   dissipation rate). The adequacy of the model at each step was carefully
   assessed using experimental data drawn from the literature. The proposed
   model was able to predict the overall volumetric mass transfer
   coefficient in STRs agitated with a Rushton turbine with good adequacy.
   The effects of operating conditions and scale-up on the distribution of
   k(L)a were also studied. The contributions of each compartment to the
   overall mass transfer inside the STR could be changed considerably by
   altering the operating conditions and scale-up. It was estimated that by
   increasing the STR size, the overall volumetric mass transfer
   coefficient decreased by at least 20\% following a conventional scale-up
   rule. This was explored by combining the concepts of the local residence
   time distribution (RTD) of the liquid phase and the local k(L)a values
   inside the STR. These findings revealed the challenges involved in
   scaling up multiphase stirred tanks. Lastly, some alternative approaches
   are suggested for the design and scale-up of multiphase reactors that
   may mitigate the inherent limitations of conventional rules. (C) 2016

Title = {{Development of an unresolved CFD-DEM model for the flow of viscous
   suspensions and its application to solid-liquid mixing}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{318}},
Pages = {{201-221}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Although viscous solid-liquid mixing plays a key role in the industry,
   the vast majority of the literature on the mixing of suspensions is
   centered around the turbulent regime of operation. However, the laminar
   and transitional regimes face considerable challenges. In particular, it
   is important to know the minimum impeller speed (N-js) that guarantees
   the suspension of all particles. In addition, local information on the
   flow patterns is necessary to evaluate the quality of mixing and
   identify the presence of dead zones. Multiphase computational fluid
   dynamics (CFD) is a powerful tool that can be used to gain insight into
   local and macroscopic properties of mixing processes. Among the variety
   of numerical models available in the literature, which are reviewed in
   this work, unresolved CFD-DEM, which combines CFD for the fluid phase
   with the discrete element method (DEM) for the solid particles, is an
   interesting approach due to its accurate prediction of the granular
   dynamics and its capability to simulate large amounts of particles. In
   this work, the unresolved CFD-DEM method is extended to viscous
   solid-liquid flows. Different solid-liquid momentum coupling strategies,
   along with their stability criteria, are investigated and their
   accuracies are compared. Furthermore, it is shown that an additional
   sub-grid viscosity model is necessary to ensure the correct rheology of
   the suspensions. The proposed model is used to study solid-liquid mixing
   in a stirred tank equipped with a pitched blade turbine. It is validated
   qualitatively by comparing the particle distribution against
   experimental observations, and quantitatively by compairing the fraction
   of suspended solids with results obtained via the pressure gauge
   technique. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a numerical and experimental assessment of a plasma
   actuation concept for controlling corner stall separation in a highly
   loaded compressor cascade. CFD simulations were first carried out to
   assess actuator effectiveness and determine the best actuation
   parameters. Subsequently, experiments were performed to demonstrate the
   concept and confirmed the CFD tool validity at a Reynolds number of 1.5
   +/- 10(5). Finally, the validated CFD tool was used to simulate the
   concept at higher velocities, beyond the experimental capability of
   existing plasma actuators. These results were used to obtain a
   preliminary scaling law that would allow approximation of the plasma
   actuation requirements at realistic operating conditions. Several
   configurations were examined, but the most effective setup was found to
   be when plasma actuators were mounted upstream of the separation point
   on both the suction surface and the endwall. Most of the improvement in
   total pressure loss stemmed from the suction surface actuator.
   Comparison with experimental data showed that the CFD simulations could
   capture the flow features and the effect of plasma actuation reasonably
   well. Simulations at higher flow velocities indicated that the required
   plasma actuator strength scales approximately with the square of the
   Reynolds number.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of nanotechnology into three-dimensional printing (3DP)
   offers huge potential and opportunities for the manufacturing of 3D
   engineered materials exhibiting optimized properties and
   multifunctionality. The literature relating to different 3DP techniques
   used to fabricate 3D structures at the macro- and microscale made of
   nanocomposite materials is reviewed here. The current state-of-the-art
   fabrication methods, their main characteristics (e.g., resolutions,
   advantages, limitations), the process parameters, and materials
   requirements are discussed. A comprehensive review is carried out on the
   use of metal-and carbon-based nanomaterials incorporated into polymers
   or hydrogels for the manufacturing of 3D structures, mostly at the
   microscale, using different 3D-printing techniques. Several methods,
   including but not limited to micro-stereolithography, extrusion-based
   direct-write technologies, inkjet-printing techniques, and popular
   powder-bed technology, are discussed. Various examples of 3D
   nanocomposite macro-and microstructures manufactured using different
   3D-printing technologies for a wide range of domains such as
   microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), lab-on-a-chip, microfluidics,
   engineered materials and composites, microelectronics, tissue

Abstract = {{Two ternary blend systems of low-density
   polyethylene/poly(ether-block-amide)/polyethylene terephthalate
   (LDPE/PEBA/PET) and LDPE/PEBA/polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) are
   prepared by melt blending to thermodynamically assemble the ionically
   conductive PEBA copolymer at the continuous interface. The LDPE/PEBA/PET
   blend demonstrates weak partial wetting and a novel morphology
   transition to complete wetting was observed as the PEBA composition
   increases from 3\% to about 10\%. The phenomena can be explained by a
   mechanism based on the competition between dewetting and coalescence of
   the PEBA phase at the interface. In the completely wet LDPE/PEBA/PVDF
   system, a minimum concentration is required to form intact PEBA layers
   with a thickness of similar to 100 nm. Assembling PEBA at the interface
   of the ternary systems results in the formation of conductive pathways
   of very low percolation thresholds and thus leads to a significant
   reduction in the resistivity for both ternary systems as compared to
   binary blends with PEBA. A particularly sharp drop in resistivity is
   observed for the complete wetting morphology of LDPE/PEBA/PVDF.}},

Abstract = {{We propose to use squeezed hollow-core photonic bandgap Bragg fibers for
   surface sensing applications. We demonstrate theoretically and confirm
   experimentally that squeezing a section of the Bragg fiber core
   increases overlap between the optical fields of the core guided modes
   and the modes bound to the sensing layer, thus, significantly enhancing
   their interaction via anticrossing phenomenon, which, in turn, enhances
   surface sensitivity of the fiber sensor. As a practical demonstration,
   we apply our fiber sensor to in situ monitoring of the dissolution
   dynamics of a sub-micron-thick polyvinyl butyral (PVB) film coated on
   the surface of the liquid-filled Bragg fiber core. Strong spectral shift
   is observed during the dissolution of the PVB film, and a surface
   spectral sensitivity of similar to 0.07nm/nm is achieved experimentally
   with aqueous analytes. The proposed fiber sensor offers a new sensing
   modality and opens new sensing applications for photonic bandgap fibers,
   such as real-time detection of binding and affinity, study of kinetics,
   etc. for a range of chemical and biological samples. (C) 2016 Optical

Abstract = {{Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has emerged as a promising
   neuroimaging technique as it allows noninvasive and long-term monitoring
   of cortical hemodynamics. Recent work by our group and others has
   revealed the potential of fNIRS, combined with electroencephalography
   (EEG), in the context of human epilepsy. Hemodynamic brain responses
   attributed to epileptic events, such as seizures and interictal
   epileptiform discharges (IEDs), are routinely observed with a good
   degree of statistical significance and in concordance with clinical
   presentation. Recording done with over 100 channels allows sufficiently
   large coverage of the epileptic focus and other areas. Three types of
   seizures have been documented: frontal lobe seizures, temporal lobe
   seizures, and posterior seizures. Increased oxygenation was observed in
   the epileptic focus in most cases, while rapid but similar hemodynamic
   variations were identified in the contralateral homologous region. While
   investigating IEDs, it was shown that their hemodynamic effect is
   observable with fNIRS, that their response is associated with
   significant (inhibitive) nonlinearities, and that the sensitivity and
   specificity of fNIRS to localize the epileptic focus can be estimated in
   a sample of 40 patients. This paper first reviews recent EEG-fNIRS
   developments in epilepsy research and then describes applications to the
   study of focal seizures and IEDs. (C) 2016 Society of Photo-Optical

Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{In geophysical inverse problems, an a priori structured mesh is often
   used for inversion and mesh refinement is applied if needed by the user
   after observation of inversion results. We have developed a new
   intelligent self-adaptive unstructured finite-element meshing technique
   for electrical resistivity tomography inverse problems. This new
   approach uses Harris corner-and-edge detectors that are based on the
   local autocorrelation function of 2D distribution of pixels. This
   meshing technique optimizes the size of the inverse problem by refining
   areas where variations in the physical property structure are sensed to
   be important. The meshing technique also generates a more appropriate
   and optimum mesh for the inverse problem that is dependent on the
   problem itself. Tests on modeled data have demonstrated that the
   proposed intelligent meshing technique can reduce data misfit, produce a
   better reconstruction of the true physical properties, and minimize the
   size of the inverse problem. The synthetic model consists of a
   conductive dike in a resistive medium. By applying the proposed
   intelligent meshing technique, the inverse model of the dike is very
   similar to the inverse model produced using fine meshes, and it is also
   better reconstructed than the inverse model produced using conventional
   meshes. We have also applied the intelligent meshing technique to survey
   data collected for groundwater-saltwater mapping and characterizing the
   subsurface conductive structure with topography included. Our results
   indicate that the new meshing technique can produce solutions that are
   comparable with standard meshing and fine meshing techniques, while
   optimizing the size of the inverse problem.}},

Abstract = {{Transmission lines or waveguides are the most fundamental building
   blocks of all electronic and photonic circuits and systems. Efforts have
   been made to incrementally evolve and improve existing transmission line
   structures to meet the increasingly stringent demands for signal
   transmission bandwidth and performance. However, a potentially
   revolutionary scheme or disruptive concept is required in support of
   future technological needs and bridging the gap between electronics and
   photonics. In this paper, we report on a fully integrated transmission
   line with simple structure that overcomes the long-standing bottleneck
   problems of high attenuation, strong dispersion, and low mode
   confinement in the guided-wave signal transmission from dc to terahertz
   (THz). This so-called mode-selective transmission line (MSTL) supports
   super-broadband and/or ultrafast pulse signal propagation, making it a
   disruptive solution for building future high-performance analog and
   digital integrated electronics and photonics. To demonstrate this
   scheme, an MSTL on fused silica substrate is designed, fabricated, and
   experimentally measured from near-dc to 0.5 THz, showing less than 0.35
   dB/mm attenuation and low dispersion characteristics over the entire
   frequency range.}},

   multisurface configurations, with emphasis on the treatment of high-lift

   its influence is appropriately taken into account for the
   aerodynamic-coefficient evaluation. The results show good agreements
   with wind-tunnel and/or highfidelity numerical data for the prediction

Abstract = {{Many hydrogeological and geophysical tools have been developed to
   determine subsoil properties, but they are often limited by sparse
   datasets and by the portability of the method from one site to another
   and often underestimate the complexity of the medium. We present a
   saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) estimation scheme, named the KES
   method, based on hydrogeophysical and numerical methods. The targeted
   medium of investigation is an unsaturated and heterogeneous soil.
   Estimation of K-s is accomplished by estimating the position of the
   wetting front and the distribution and velocity of flow lines during an
   infiltration test. Using numerical modeling, K-s is determined by
   minimizing the velocity difference between the measured flow lines and
   the modeled flow lines. Surface and buried electrodes are used as part
   of the electrical resistivity survey in determining the position of the
   wetting front. An instantaneous profile method is used to determine the
   water retention curve of the medium. The KES method has been tested and
   validated using data produced from simple and more complex geological
   models from published case studies. We obtained good reconstruction of
   the saturated hydraulic conductivity. We have found that the estimated
   value of K-s in log scale has a mean error < 2.5\%. Error increases
   along the boundaries of different hydrofacies.}},

Abstract = {{A compact bandpass filter exhibiting an ultra-wide out-of-band rejection
   is studied and developed. A combination of electromagnetic bandgap
   (EBG)-loaded half-mode substrate integrated waveguide (HMSIW) and
   composite right/left-handed (CRLH) HMSIW is used in this development.
   The proposed filter operates below the characteristic cutoff frequency
   of HMSIW. The CRLH HMSIW loaded with EBG structures is investigated
   first. The filter with a miniaturized size is then implemented with two
   slots etched on HMSIW to reduce coupling effects between EBG structures
   and interdigital capacitors. Defected microstrip structure (DMS) as feed
   lines are used to obtain an ultra-wide out-of-band rejection. Measured
   results show that this effective stopband can cover up to 10.3 times the
   design center frequency for a rejection level of 20 dB. The filter
   exhibits high selectivity, good stopband performance, and compact size.}},

Abstract = {{Estimating the amount of harvestable ambient RF and microwave power from
   the omnipresent electromagnetic sources is of vital importance when
   designing a wireless device that makes use of ambient microwave power
   harvesting (AMPH) as a power source. This paper studies and looks into
   the underlying RF and microwave rectification mechanism at low input
   ambient power levels, specifically -30 dBm and below. A fundamental
   theory is formulated and developed, which is able to correctly predict
   the efficiency of a rectifier including the effects of matching network
   insertion losses through an easy-to-understand analytical model. The
   suggested model provides a direct design guideline in determining and
   choosing the optimal diode for a predetermined application. Based on the
   developed theoretical framework, the diode characteristics that have a
   direct impact on the microwave power conversion efficiency are discussed
   in detail. Three different Schottky diode rectifiers were designed on
   the basis of the tools described in this paper, thereby validating the
   proposed model and highlighting the influence of critical diode
   parameters on its performances. The measured results are then compared
   with those predicted by the proposed model and state-of-the-art
   microwave power rectifiers, showing a good model accuracy and also a
   10\% improvement in the rectifying efficiency for the low input power
   levels of interest.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a class of high-data-rate battery-free yet active
   miniature radio-frequency identification tag without any external
   components (except antenna) operating at millimeter (mm)-wave
   frequencies is proposed and demonstrated. This fully embedded tag
   consists of a recently proposed CMOS-based zero-intermediate-frequency
   self-oscillating mixer, a high power conversion efficiency mm-wave-to-dc
   rectifier, and an ultralow-power voltage regulator on a single chip,
   integrated with ceramic-based antennas. Interconnection between the CMOS
   die and the antenna is realized using a wire-bonding technique, which is
   compensated and optimized to match the antenna input impedance and also
   to minimize the wire-bond associated losses at mm frequencies. The 10 x
   10 mm(2) tag wirelessly harvests its energy from an incoming signal at
   24 GHz, receives, and recovers the data sent by reader on an amplitude
   modulation (AM)-modulated 40-GHz carrier, and transmits its data back to
   the reader on a 40-GHz carrier, using AM modulation as well. The tag
   exhibits a bit rate of about 500 kb/s during the reader-to-tag
   communication and 10 Mb/s during the tag-to-reader communication, solely
   relying on the rectified energy for powering its operation. To the best
   of our knowledge, such an mm-wave identification tag at mm-wave
   frequencies has never been reported in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, interchip/intrachip optical interconnection networks have been
   proposed for ultrahigh-bandwidth and low-latency communications. These
   networks employ the microresonators (MRs) to modulate, direct, or detect
   the optical signal. However, utilized MRs suffer from intrinsic
   crosstalk noise and signal power loss, degrading the network efficiency
   via the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The amount of crosstalk noise and
   signal power loss may differ from network to network. Hence, there
   exists a need to systematically analyze the effect of the crosstalk
   noise and the power loss issues. In this paper, we have developed the
   analytical models considering both coherent and incoherent crosstalk for
   both the interchip and intrachip optical networks. The
   interchip/intrachip optical interconnection networks-the (ICON)-C-2-are
   analyzed as a case study. The quantitative results on the individual
   networks have demonstrated that the architectural design determines the
   impact of crosstalk on the SNR. We have also demonstrated that the
   optical interconnection networks with interchip/intrachip interconnects
   result in better bit error rate (BER) compared with that of only
   intrachip interconnect. Our analyses of the worst case can be utilized
   as a platform to compare the realistic performance among different
   optical interconnection networks via the degradation of SNR/BER and data
   bandwidth.}},

Abstract = {{Silver nanoparticles-filled nanocomposite materials are fabricated and
   used as electrically conductive coatings for aerospace composite
   structures. Silver nanoparticles are first synthesized, then mixed with
   polymer solutions, and applied onto the surface of carbon fiber
   composite substrates either by casting or spraying technique. Two design
   strategies are studied: the reduction of nanofillers contact resistance
   using a conductive polymer as binder and the addition of a second
   polymer to fabricate a ternary biphasic nanocomposite for the further
   improvement of mechanical resistance of the coatings. The coatings are
   then annealed at different temperatures up to 200 degrees C and
   characterized using various techniques in order to evaluate their
   morphology, electrical resistivity, and mechanical performance. The
   thermal annealing considerably improves the adhesion of the coatings to
   the composite substrates as well as the scratch resistance of the
   coatings. A significant improvement (approx. six orders) of electrical
   properties is achieved for a approximate to 10m-thick coating film after
   the thermal annealing. The best results are achieved with silver
   nanoparticles mixed with the conductive polymer binder with the maximum
   resistivity of 4.2x10(-3)gcm(-2). The conductivity achieved here is
   fairly close to that values required in order for the materials to be
   used for coating of composite structures in potential aerospace
   applications such as electromagnetic interference shielding and lighting
   strike protection.}},

Abstract = {{We numerically study the collective resonances and field profiles of
   two-dimensional arrays of large metallic nanodisks supporting multipolar
   plasmonic modes in nearly homogeneous environments. We show that,
   depending on the wavelength, these arrays can support two distinct
   collective modes with orthogonal field intensity distributions. In one
   of these modes (scattering mode), the optical scattering between the
   nanodisks forms a sharp optical feature with significant sensitivity to
   the refractive index of the environment. In the second mode
   (optical-band mode), the nanodisks are mainly coupled via an optical
   band with a field intensity profile perpendicular to the incident light
   polarization. This mode is associated with a subtle optical peak with
   much less sensitivity to the environment. We demonstrate that around
   this peak, the nanodisks support a unique asymmetrical field dispersion
   and energy flow paths. For a given wavelength range, the plasmon fields
   in this mode deeply penetrate into the substrate while energy moves up
   from the substrate between the gaps of the nanodisks, forming energy
   whirlpools in the superstrate. With a slight wavelength change, these
   fields switch to the superstrate, and the direction of the gap energy
   path is inverted. We investigate how such features can be tuned by
   adding a thin layer of silicon between the substrate and superstrate and
   discuss the applicability of the scattering mode for sensitive sensors.

Abstract = {{LiFePO4/C material has been prepared using fast-melt synthesis method
   followed by grinding and carbon coating. The low-cost iron ore
   concentrate (IOC) and purified iron ore concentrate (IOP) were used as
   iron precursors in the melt process to reduce significantly the cost of
   LiFePO4/C. The same product was also synthesized using pure Fe2O3 under
   similar conditions as reference. The physical-chemical and
   electrochemical properties of samples were investigated. The X-ray
   Diffraction (XRD) results confirm the formation of an olivine structure
   of LiFePO4 with a minor amount of Li3PO4 and Li4P2O7 impurities for all
   the samples but no Fe2P. The power performances of LiFePO4/C using
   low-cost iron precursors were close to the sample using pure Fe2O3
   precursor although capacity in mAh g(-1) is somewhat lower. With the
   inherent presence of silicon and other metals species,
   multi-substitution may take place when using IOC as source of iron
   leading to a Li(Fe1-yMy)(P1-xSix)O-4 general composition.
   Multi-substitution, however, allows a better cycling stability.
   Therefore, these iron precursors present a promising option in this
   field to reduce the cost of a large-scale synthesis of LiFePO4/C for
   Li-ion batteries application.}},

Abstract = {{Textile permeability is a generally anisotropic material property, which
   characterizes the ease of establishing a resin flow through the fibrous
   reinforcement in Liquid composite molding (LCM) processes.
   Unidirectional injection experiments are commonly performed to determine
   in-plane permeability. Effective permeability values have to be measured
   along three different textile directions to calculate the full in-plane
   permeability tensor. This article presents a strategy to reduce the
   number of the required unidirectional experiments to two or even one by
   considering the angle that the flow front forms with the measurement
   direction. The relationship between this flow front angle and the
   permeability tensor elements was derived theoretically and verified by
   both simulations and experiments with various textile reinforcements. In
   addition, two methods were investigated to measure the flow front angle
   and the effective permeability during the experiments: a standard
   approach based on visual observations and a new method that relies on
   three pressure sensors, applicable also in the case of nontransparent
   tooling. The results show that: (I) the two methods provide consistent
   measurements and are substantially equivalent; (II) the strategy devised
   to characterize permeability by measuring the flow front angle is
   effective and accurate; (III) the proposed procedure allows reducing
   considerably the time and the material samples required for permeability
   characterization by unidirectional experiments. POLYM. COMPOS.,

Abstract = {{We consider a multi-agent system with linear stochastic individual
   dynamics, and individual linear quadratic ergodic cost functions. The
   agents partially observe their own states. Their cost functions and
   initial statistics are a priori independent but they are coupled through
   an interference term (the mean of all agent states), entering each of
   their individual measurement equations. While in general for a finite
   number of agents, the resulting optimal control law may be a non linear
   function of the available observations, we establish that for certain
   classes of cost and dynamic parameters, optimal separated control laws
   obtained by ignoring the interference coupling, are asymptotically
   optimal when the number of agents goes to infinity, thus forming for
   finite N, an is an element of-Nash equilibrium. More generally though,
   optimal separated control laws may not be asymptotically optimal, and
   can in fact result in unstable overall behavior. Thus we consider a
   class of parameterized decentralized control laws whereby the separated
   Kalman gain is treated as the arbitrary gain of a Luenberger like
   observer. System stability regions are characterized and the nature of
   optimal cooperative control policies within the considered class is
   explored. Numerical results and an application example for wireless
   communications are reported. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{227-236}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Pyrolusite is an inexpensive and nontoxic manganese ore with exceptional
   oxygen transfer capacity that makes it a potential candidate for
   chemical looping combustion. We evaluate the oxygen transfer capacity
   and kinetics of pyrolusite, an inexpensive and nontoxic manganese ore.
   We reduced it with carbon monoxide and a combination of carbon monoxide,
   methane and hydrogen. At 960 degrees C, carbon monoxide and hydrogen
   reduce the calcined pyrolusite 86\% more than does a pure CO stream. We
   derived a mechanistic kinetic model based on the effluent species
   concentration during reduction with a combination of methane, carbon
   monoxide and hydrogen from 810 degrees C to 960 degrees C. The direct
   reduction of surface oxygen sites by carbon monoxide, in equilibrium
   with the reverse CO2 reoxidation, in addition to the reoxidation of the
   surface by oxygen atoms from the bulk of the lattice, explains more than
   95\% of the variance of the data. We estimated surface parameters by
   comparing the carbon monoxide and helium washout curves and by analyzing
   the initial response to a step change in the inlet concentration.
   Adsorbed CO increased with temperature, up to 910 degrees C, where it
   peaked at 551 mu mol m(-2), corresponding to a 70\% covered surface. The
   estimated oxygen surface site density followed an asymptote at 40 tmol
   m(-2), in agreement with measured values. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

   frequency at which the transition starts and f(s) is the frequency above
   which a surface wave is completed. In the frequency region higher than
   the frequency fs, the earth-return impedance has minor contribution to
   the wave propagation, because it is no more an earth-return wave but a
   surface wave. This has been also investigated in the time domain based

Title = {{A quantitative metabolomics study of high sodium response in Clostridium
   acetobutylicum ATCC 824 acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 20}},
Abstract = {{Hemicellulose hydrolysates, sugar-rich feedstocks used in biobutanol
   refinery, are normally obtained by adding sodium hydroxide in the
   hydrolyze process. However, the resulting high sodium concentration in
   the hydrolysate inhibits ABE (acetone-butanol-ethanol) fermentation, and
   thus limits the use of these low-cost feedstocks. We have thus studied
   the effect of high sodium on the metabolic behavior of Clostridium
   acetobutyricum ATCC 824, with xylose as the carbon source. At a
   threshold sodium concentration of 200 mM, a decrease of the maximum cell
   dry weight (-19.50 +/- 0.85\%) and of ABE yield (-35.14 +/- 3.50\%
   acetone, -33.37 +/- 0.74\% butanol, -22.95 +/- 1.81\% ethanol) were
   observed compared to control culture. However, solvents specific
   productivities were not affected by supplementing sodium. The main
   effects of high sodium on cell metabolism were observed in acidogenesis,
   during which we observed the accumulation of ATP and NADH, and the
   inhibition of the pentose phosphate (PPP) and the glycolytic pathways
   with up to 80.73 +/- 1.47\% and 68.84 +/- 3.42\% decrease of the
   associated metabolic intermediates, respectively. However, the
   NADP+-to-NADPH ratio was constant for the whole culture duration, a
   phenomenon explaining the robustness of solvents specific
   productivities. Therefore, high sodium, which inhibited biomass growth
   through coordinated metabolic effects, interestingly triggered cell
   robustness on solvents specific productivity.}},

Abstract = {{Virus-like particles (VLPs) constitute a promising alternative as
   influenza vaccine. They are non-replicative particles that mimic the
   morphology of native viruses which make them more immunogenic than
   classical subunit vaccines. In this study, we propose HEK-293 cells in
   suspension culture in serum free medium as an efficient platform to
   produce large quantities of VLPs. For this purpose, a stable cell line
   expressing the main influenza viral antigens hemagglutinin (HA) and
   neuraminidase (NA) (subtype H1N1) under the regulation of a cumate
   inducible promoter was developed (293HA-NA cells). The production of
   VLPs was evaluated by transient transfection of plasmids encoding human
   immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Gag or M1 influenza matrix protein. To
   facilitate the monitoring of VLPs production, Gag was fused to the green
   fluorescence protein (GFP). The transient transfection of the gag
   containing plasmid in 293HA-NA cells increased the release of HA and NA
   seven times more than its counterpart transfected with the M1 encoding
   plasmid. Consequently, the production of HA-NA containing VLPs using Gag
   as scaffold was evaluated in a 3-L controlled stirred tank bioreactor.
   The VLPs secreted in the culture medium were recovered by
   ultracentrifugation on a sucrose cushion and ultrafiltered by tangential
   flow filtration. Transmission electron micrographs of final sample
   revealed the presence of particles with the average typical size
   (150-200 nm) and morphology of HIV-1 immature particles. The
   concentration of the influenza glycoproteins on the Gag-VLPs was
   estimated by single radial immunodiffusion and hemagglutination assay
   for HA and by Dot-Blot for HA and NA. More significantly, intranasal
   immunization of mice with influenza Gag-VLPs induced strong
   antigen-specific mucosal and systemic antibody responses and provided
   full protection against a lethal intranasal challenge with the
   homologous virus strain. These data suggest that, with further
   optimization and characterization the process could support mass
   production of safer and better-controlled VLPs-based influenza vaccine
   candidate. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Durable products are characterized by their modular structured design as
   well as their long life cycle. Each class of components involved in the
   multi-indenture structure of such products requires a different recovery
   process. Moreover, due to their long life cycle, the return flows are of
   various quality levels. In this article, we study a closed-loop supply
   chain in the context of durable products with generic modular
   structures. To this end, we propose a mixed-integer programming model
   based on a generic disassembly tree where the number of each
   sub-assembly depends on the quality status of the return stream. The
   model determines the location of various types of facilities in the
   reverse network while coordinating forward and reverse flows. We also
   consider the legislative target for the recovery of used products as a
   constraint in the problem formulation. We present a Benders
   decomposition-based solution algorithm together with several algorithmic
   enhancements for this problem. Computational results illustrate the
   superior performance of the solution method. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{305}},

Abstract = {{The Generalized Finite Element Method (GFEM) is an extension of the
   Finite Element Method (FEM), where the standard finite element space is
   augmented with a space of non-polynomial functions, called the
   enrichment space. The functions in the enrichment space mimic the local
   behavior of the unknown solution of the underlying variational problem.
   GFEM has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems. However,
   it often suffers from bad conditioning, i.e., its conditioning may not
   be robust with respect to the mesh and in fact, the conditioning could
   be much worse than that of the standard FEM. In this paper, we present a
   numerical study that shows that if the ``angle{''} between the finite
   element space and the enrichment space is bounded away from 0, uniformly
   with respect to the mesh, then the GFEM is stable, i.e., the
   conditioning of GFEM is not worse than that of the standard FEM. A GFEM
   with this property is called a Stable GFEM (SGFEM). The last part of the
   paper is devoted to the derivation of a robust iterative solver
   exploiting this angle condition. It is shown that the required
   ``wall-clock{''} time is greatly reduced compared to popular GFEMs used
   in the literature. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Disc hydration is controlled by fluid imbibition and exudation and hence
   by applied load magnitude and history, internal osmotic pressure and
   disc conditions. It affects both the internal load distribution and
   external load-bearing of a disc while variations therein give rise to
   the disc time-dependent characteristics. This study aimed to evaluate
   the effect of changes in compression preload magnitude on the disc axial
   cyclic compression stiffness under physiological loading.
   After 20 h of free hydration, effects of various preload magnitudes (no
   preload, 0.06 and 0.28 MPa, applied for eight hours) and disc-bone
   preparation conditions on disc height and axial stiffness were
   investigated using 36 disc-bone and 24 isolated disc (without bony
   endplates) bovine specimens. After preloading, specimens were subjected
   to ten loading/unloading cycles each of 7.5 min compression at 0.5 MPa
   followed by 7.5 min at 0.06 MPa.
   Under 0.06 MPa preload, the specimen height losses during high loading
   periods of cyclic loading were greater than corresponding height
   recoveries during low loading phases. This resulted in a progressive
   reduction in the specimen height and increase in its stiffness.
   Differences between disc height losses in high cyclic loads and between
   stiffness in both load increase and release phases were significant for
   0 and 0.06 MPa vs. 0.28 MPa preload.
   Results highlight the significant role of disc preload magnitude/history
   and hence disc height and hydration on disc stiffness in
   loading/unloading and disc height loss in loading periods. Proper
   preconditioning and hence hydration level should be achieved if recovery
   in height loss similar to in vivo conditions is expected. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In this study, the paraffin wax is used in a moulding process to
   fabricate two dielectric lenses with the diameter of 24 inches for

   implementation compared to the conventional machining procedure. To
   verify the lens performance, the two fabricated samples are used to
   measure the S-parameters of a well-known spiral metamaterial unit cell.
   In this process, a three-dimensional prototype of the unit cell is
   fabricated and placed between two standard horn antennas facing each
   other, and the dielectric lenses are used in front of the each horn
   antenna to ensure that the metamaterial prototype is correctly
   illuminated by the incident wave. This experiment provides a very good
   agreement with the simulation and confirms that the lens structure works

Abstract = {{A class of slow-wave substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) structures
   patterned with microstrip polyline is presented, theoretically studied,
   and experimentally validated, which demonstrates some interesting
   slow-wave propagation effects. The slow-wave SIW (SW-SIW) enables the
   size reduction of a physically large circuit without sacrificing its
   performance. A size reduction of 40\% of the lateral dimension is
   achieved with reference to that of the conventional SIW counterpart at
   the same cutoff frequency. Meanwhile, the phase velocity of the
   waveguide is also reduced by 40\%, resulting in a smaller longitudinal
   dimension for a given electrical length. Both lateral and longitudinal
   effects give rise to a total size reduction, largely extending the
   operation range of SIW structures in the low-frequency region, which has
   often been restrained by a physical dimension-related cutoff frequency.
   Also, a transmission line-based two-dimensional (2-D) equivalent-circuit
   model is proposed and deployed for the modeling and analysis of the
   slow-wave mechanism. The results from the equivalent-circuit model
   agrees very well with that from the full-wave simulations. Furthermore,
   a broadband microstrip to SW-SIW taper with good return loss is designed
   for measurement verification. Using the proposed SW-SIW structure, the
   size of conventional SIW-based microwave circuits such as power
   splitters, couplers, and filters can be further reduced in addition to
   the existing size-reduction techniques.}},

Title = {{Evaluating the impact of design pattern and anti-pattern dependencies on
   changes and faults}},
Journal = {{EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{896-931}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{On the one hand, design patterns are solutions to recurring design
   problems, aimed at increasing reuse, flexibility, and maintainability.
   However, much prior work found that some patterns, such as the Observer
   and Singleton, are correlated with large code structures and argued that
   they are more likely to be fault prone. On the other hand, anti-patterns
   describe poor solutions to design and implementation problems that
   highlight weaknesses in the design of software systems and that may slow
   down maintenance and increase the risk of faults. They have been found
   to negatively impact change and fault-proneness. Classes participating
   in design patterns and anti-patterns have dependencies with other
   classes, e.g., static and co-change dependencies, that may propagate
   problems to other classes. We investigate the impact of such
   dependencies in object-oriented systems by studying the relations
   between the presence of static and co-change dependencies and (1) the
   fault-proneness, (2) the types of changes, and (3) the types of faults
   that these classes exhibit. We analyze six design patterns and 10
   anti-patterns in 39 releases of ArgoUML, JFreeChart, and XercesJ, and
   investigate to what extent classes having dependencies with design
   patterns or anti-patterns have higher odds of faults than other classes.
   We show that in almost all releases of the three systems, classes having
   dependencies with anti-patterns are more fault-prone than others while
   this is not always true for classes with dependencies with design
   patterns. We also observe that structural changes are the most common
   changes impacting classes having dependencies with anti-patterns.
   Software developers could use this knowledge about the impact of design
   pattern and anti-pattern dependencies to better focus their testing and
   reviewing activities towards the most risky classes and to propagate
   changes adequately.}},

   Cancer-Fighting Nanorobots}},
Journal = {{MICROMACHINES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{The delivery of drug molecules to tumor hypoxic areas could yield
   optimal therapeutic outcomes. This suggests that effective
   cancer-fighting micro- or nanorobots would require more integrated
   functionalities than just the development of directional propelling
   constructs which have so far been the main general emphasis in medical
   micro- and nanorobotic research. Development of artificial agents that
   would be most effective in targeting hypoxic regions may prove to be a
   very challenging task considering present technological constraints.
   Self-propelled, sensory-based and directionally-controlled agents in the
   form of Magnetotactic Bacteria (MTB) of the MC-1 strain have been
   investigated as effective therapeutic nanorobots in cancer therapy.
   Following computer-based magnetotactic guidance to reach the tumor area,
   the microaerophilic response of drug-loaded MC-1 cells could be
   exploited in the tumoral interstitial fluid microenvironments.
   Accordingly, their swimming paths would be guided by a decreasing oxygen
   concentration towards the hypoxic regions. However, the implementation
   of such a targeting strategy calls for a method to switch from a
   computer-assisted magnetotactic displacement control to an autonomous
   aerotactic displacement control. In this way, the MC-1 cells will
   navigate to tumoral regions and, once there, target hypoxic areas
   through their microaerophilic behavior. Here we show not only how the
   magnitude of the magnetic field can be used for this purpose but how the
   findings could help determine the specifications of a future compatible
   interventional platform within known technological and medical
   constraints.}},

Abstract = {{The task of the Emotion Recognition in the Wild (EmotiW) Challenge is to
   assign one of seven emotions to short video clips extracted from
   Hollywood style movies. The videos depict acted-out emotions under
   realistic conditions with a large degree of variation in attributes such
   as pose and illumination, making it worthwhile to explore approaches
   which consider combinations of features from multiple modalities for
   label assignment. In this paper we present our approach to learning
   several specialist models using deep learning techniques, each focusing
   on one modality. Among these are a convolutional neural network,
   focusing on capturing visual information in detected faces, a deep
   belief net focusing on the representation of the audio stream, a K-Means
   based ``bag-of-mouths{''} model, which extracts visual features around
   the mouth region and a relational autoencoder, which addresses
   spatio-temporal aspects of videos. We explore multiple methods for the
   combination of cues from these modalities into one common classifier.
   This achieves a considerably greater accuracy than predictions from our
   strongest single-modality classifier. Our method was the winning
   submission in the 2013 Emoti W challenge and achieved a test set
   accuracy of 47.67 \% on the 2014 dataset.}},

Abstract = {{Stable superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs), which can be

   relaxivities, are ideal candidates for biomedical applications including

   methodology to render water dispersibility to SPIONs using tetraethylene
   glycol (TEG)-based phosphonate ligands, which are easily introduced onto
   SPIONs by either a ligand exchange process of surface-anchored
   oleic-acid (OA) molecules or via direct conjugation. Both protocols
   confer good colloidal stability to SPIONs at different NaCl
   concentrations. A detailed characterization of functionalized SPIONs
   suggests that the ligand exchange method leads to nanoparticles with
   better magnetic properties but higher toxicity and cell death, than the
   direct conjugation methodology.}},

Abstract = {{Blackbox optimization deals with situations in which the objective
   function and constraints are typically computed by launching a
   time-consuming computer simulation. The subject of this work is the mesh
   adaptive direct search (mads) class of algorithms for blackbox
   optimization. We propose a way to dynamically scale the mesh, which is
   the discrete spatial structure on which mads relies, so that it
   automatically adapts to the characteristics of the problem to solve.
   Another objective of the paper is to revisit the mads method in order to
   ease its presentation and to reflect recent developments. This new
   presentation includes a nonsmooth convergence analysis. Finally,
   numerical tests are conducted to illustrate the efficiency of the
   dynamic scaling, both on academic test problems and on a supersonic

Abstract = {{In many large engineering design problems, it is not computationally
   feasible or realistic to store Jacobians or Hessians explicitly.
   Matrix-free implementations of standard optimization
   methods-implementations that do not explicitly form Jacobians and
   Hessians, and possibly use quasi-Newton approximations-circumvent those
   restrictions, but such implementations are virtually non-existent. We
   develop a matrix-free augmented-Lagrangian algorithm for nonconvex
   problems with both equality and inequality constraints. Our
   implementation is developed in the Python language, is available as an
   open-source package, and allows for approximating Hessian and Jacobian
   information.We show that our approach solves problems from the CUTEr and
   COPS test sets in a comparable number of iterations to state-of-the-art
   solvers. We report numerical results on a structural design problem that
   is typical in aircraft wing design optimization. The matrix-free
   approach makes solving problems with thousands of design variables and
   constraints tractable, even when function and gradient evaluations are
   costly.}},

Title = {{Co-immobilization of adhesive peptides and VEGF within a dextran-based
   coating for vascular applications}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{37}},
Pages = {{69-82}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Multifunctional constructs providing a proper environment for adhesion
   and growth of selected cell types are needed for most tissue engineering
   and regenerative medicine applications. In this context, vinylsulfone
   (VS)-modified dextran was proposed as a matrix featuring low-fouling
   properties as well as multiple versatile moieties. The displayed VS
   groups could indeed react with thiol, amine or hydroxyl groups, be it
   for surface grafting, crosslinking or subsequent tethering of
   biomolecules. In the present study, a library of dextran-VS was
   produced, grafted to aminated substrates and characterized in terms of
   degree of VS modification (\%VS), cell-repelling properties and
   potential for the oriented grafting of cysteine-tagged peptides. As a
   bioactive coating of vascular implants, ECM peptides (e.g. RGD) as well
   as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were co-immobilized on one
   of the most suitable dextran-VS coating (\%VS = ca. 50\% of saccharides
   units). Both RGD and VEGF were efficiently tethered at high densities
   (ca. 1 nmol/cm(2) and 50 fmol/cm(2), respectively), and were able to
   promote endothelial cell adhesion as well as proliferation. The latter
   was enhanced to the same extent as with soluble VEGF and proved
   selective to endothelial cells over smooth muscle cells. Altogether,
   multiple biomolecules could be efficiently incorporated into a
   dextran-VS construct, while maintaining their respective biological
   activity.
   Statement of Significance
   This work addresses the need for multifunctional coatings and selective
   cell response inherent to many tissue engineering and regenerative
   medicine applications, for instance, vascular graft. More specifically,
   a library of dextrans was first generated through vinylsulfone (VS)
   modification. Thoroughly selected dextran-VS provided an ideal platform
   for unbiased study of cell response to covalently grafted biomolecules.
   Considering that processes such as healing and angiogenesis require
   multiple factors acting synergistically, vascular endothelial growth
   factor (VEGF) was then co-immobilized with the cell adhesive RGD peptide
   within our dextran coating through a relevant strategy featuring
   orientation and specificity. Altogether, both adhesive and proliferative
   cues could be incorporated into our construct with additive, if not
   synergetic, effects. (c) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance navigation (MRN), achieved with an upgraded MRI
   scanner, aims to guide therapeutic nanoparticles from their release in
   the hepatic vascular network to embolize highly vascularized liver
   tumors. Visualizing the catheter in real-time within the arterial
   network is important for selective embolization within the MR gantry. To
   achieve this, a new MR-compatible catheter tracking technology based on
   optical shape sensing is used.
   This paper proposes a vessel-based registration pipeline to co-align
   this novel catheter tracking technology to the patient's diagnostic MR
   angiography (MRA) with 3D roadmapping. The method first extracts the 3D
   hepatic arteries from a diagnostic MRA based on concurrent deformable
   models, creating a detailed representation of the patient's internal
   anatomy. Once the optical shape sensing fibers, inserted in a
   double-lumen catheter, is guided into the hepatic arteries, the 3D
   centerline of the catheter is inferred and updated in real-time using
   strain measurements derived from fiber Bragg gratings sensors. Using
   both centerlines, a diffeomorphic registration based on a spectral
   representation of the high-level geometrical primitives is applied.
   Results show promise in registration accuracy in five phantom models
   created from stereolithography of patient-specific vascular anatomies,
   with maximum target registration errors below 2 mm. Furthermore,
   registration accuracy with the shape sensing tracking technology remains
   insensitive to the magnetic field of the MR magnet.
   This study demonstrates that an accurate registration procedure of a
   shape sensing catheter with diagnostic imaging is feasible.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical model has been created to estimate the in-plane and

   The model is based on the calculation of the pressure drop in the

   the dimensions and distribution of the mesopores are determined from the
   weaving parameters. A mesoscopic permeability model can then be inferred
   from the fabric structural data. The contribution of the microscopic
   flow inside the tows is also taken into account by introducing the
   concept of dual scale porosity. This additional feature is shown to
   improve the permeability model, which is validated by comparison with
   the experimental values of principal permeability measured for five
   different three-dimensional Interlock fabrics.}},

Abstract = {{Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are novel nanomaterials produced by the
   pulp and paper industry. The surface properties of CNCs are key factors
   for their dispersion in solvents. These polar materials disperse readily
   in water, but not in organic solvents. The ability to disperse into
   typically non-polar organic matrices is an indispensable requirement to
   exploit the growing market for nanocomposite materials. We present an
   innovative approach for modifying the surface of CNCs through scalable,
   gas-phase photo-initiated chemical vapour deposition (PICVD). Using
   syngas as a treatment precursor, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
   this technique to render the surface of the CNCs compatible with mildly
   polar and non-polar solvents, evidenced by contact angle measurements.
   Further proof of this successful modification is given through
   dispersion assays, showing for example the ability to disperse treated
   CNC in toluene (whereas untreated samples do not disperse). Suspensions
   in organic solvents remain stable in excess of two weeks. Chemical
   characterization through XPS and FTIR confirms the presence of an
   oxygen-containing coating on the CNC surface.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a robust control strategy for the autonomous
   operation of a microgrid consisting of electronically coupled
   distributed generation (DG) units. The DG units are connected to a point
   of common coupling, and supply a load, which can be unbalanced and/or
   nonlinear. In practice, the load is usually unknown in terms of network
   topology and parameters. However, it is assumed that the load current is
   measurable and bounded. In this case, considering the load current as a
   measurable disturbance signal, the controller design is formulated to an
   H-infinity optimization problem in order to minimize the adverse impact
   of harmonics and negative-sequence voltage due to nonlinear and
   unbalanced loads. The optimization problem is then converted into a
   convex linear matrix inequality (LMI) condition, which is simply solved
   using MATLAB LMI toolbox. The performance of the proposed controller is
   verified using hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) real-time simulations carried
   out in OPAL-RT technologies. The HIL results show that the proposed
   controller provides the load with a set of sinusoidal, three-phase
   balanced voltages despite several unbalanced and nonlinear load
   conditions.}},

Title = {{Cumulative effects of fecal contamination from combined sewer overflows:
   Management for source water protection}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{174}},
Pages = {{62-70}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{The quality of a drinking water source depends largely on upstream
   contaminant discharges. Sewer overflows can have a large influence on
   downstream drinking water intakes as they discharge untreated or
   partially treated wastewaters that may be contaminated with pathogens.
   This study focuses on the quantification of Escherichia coil discharges
   from combined sewer overflows (CSOs) and the dispersion and diffusion in
   receiving waters in order to prioritize actions for source water
   protection. E. coli concentrations from CSOs were estimated from
   monitoring data at a series of overflow structures and then applied to
   the 42 active overflow structures between 2009 and 2012 using a simple
   relationship based upon the population within the drainage network. From
   these estimates, a transport-dispersion model was calibrated with data
   from a monitoring program from both overflow structures and downstream
   drinking water intakes. The model was validated with 15 extreme events
   such as a large number of overflows (n > 8) or high concentrations at
   drinking water intakes. Model results demonstrated the importance of the
   cumulative effects of CSOs on the degradation of water quality
   downstream. However, permits are typically issued on a discharge point
   basis and do not consider cumulative effects. Source water protection
   plans must consider the cumulative effects of discharges and their
   concentrations because the simultaneous discharge of multiple overflows
   can lead to elevated E. coli concentrations at a drinking water intake.
   In addition, some CSOs have a disproportionate impact on peak
   concentrations at drinking water intakes. As such, it is recommended
   that the management of CSOs move away from frequency based permitting at
   the discharge point to focus on the development of comprehensive
   strategies to reduce cumulative and peak discharges from CSOs upstream
   of drinking water intakes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the coexistence issue between multiband-orthogonal
   frequency-division multiplexing (MB-OFDM) and time-hopping
   ultra-wideband (TH-UWB) networks is widely analyzed. For this purpose,
   to study and model the TH-UWB interference, an analytical framework
   which describes key features of the interference distribution is
   provided. The interference distribution is studied in the context of
   TH-UWB's signaling parameters. Our results reveal that the interference
   distribution highly depends on its time-hopping parameters. Therefore,
   choosing proper time-hopping parameters leads to less destructive
   interferences. The Generalized Gaussian and the Symmetric-alpha-Stable
   (S alpha S) distributions are used to model the interference-plus-noise
   signal. The maximum likelihood and a characteristic function-based
   regression-type methods are adopted to estimate parameters of
   Generalized Gaussian and S alpha S distributions, respectively.
   Moreover, the interference channel effects on the impulsive behavior of
   the TH-UWB signal is studied. It is shown that impulsive behavior of the
   faded interference signals highly depends on the channel
   time-dispersiveness. Furthermore, an exact performance of a
   multiband-orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing system impaired by
   a TH-UWB system is derived. The comparison of the analytical
   performance, the empirical simulation, and the approximation results
   show that both approximation methods are valid for low
   interference-to-noise-ratio, while S alpha S provides a more accurate
   approximation for high interference-to-noise-ratio. Copyright (C) 2015

Title = {{Natural olivine crystal-fabrics in the western Pacific convergence

Journal = {{EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{443}},

Abstract = {{Crystallographic preferred orientations (CPOs) of olivine within natural
   peridotites are commonly depicted by pole figures for the {[}100],
   {[}010], and {[}001] axes, and they can be categorized into five
   well-known fabric types: A, B, C, D, and E. These fabric types can be
   related to olivine slip systems: A with (010){[}100], B with
   (010){[}001], C with (001){[}001], D with \{0k1\}{[}100], and E with
   (001){[}100]. In addition, an AG type is commonly found in nature, but
   its origin is controversial, and could involve several contributing
   factors such as complex slip systems, non-coaxial strain types, or the
   effects of melt during plastic flow. In this paper we present all of our
   olivine fabric database published previously as well as new data mostly
   from ocean floor, mainly for the convergent margin of the western
   Pacific region, and we introduce a new index named Fabric-Index Angle
   (FIA), which is related to the P-wave property of a single olivine
   crystal. The FIA can be used as an alternative to classifying the CPOs
   into the six fabric types, and it allows a set of CPOs to be expressed
   as a single angle in a range between -90 degrees and 180 degrees. The
   six olivine fabric types have unique values of FIA: 63 degrees for A
   type, -28 degrees for B type, 158 degrees for C type, 90 degrees for D
   type, 106 degrees for E type, and 0 degrees for AG type. We divided our
   olivine database into five tectonic groups: ophiolites, ridge
   peridotites, trench peridotites, peridotite xenoliths, and peridotites
   enclosed in high-pressure metamorphic rocks. Our results show that
   although our database is not yet large enough (except for trench
   peridotites) to define the characteristics of the five tectonic groups,
   the natural olivine fabrics vary in their range of FIA: 0 degrees to 150
   degrees for the ophiolites, 40 degrees to 80 degrees for the ridge
   peridotites, -40 degrees to 100 degrees for the trench peridotites, 0
   degrees to 100 degrees for the peridotite xenoliths, and 40 degrees to
   10 degrees for the peridotites enclosed in high-pressure metamorphic
   rocks. The trench peridotites show a statistically unimodal distribution
   of FIA consisting of the high peak equivalent of the A type, but with
   some FIAs close to the AG and D types. The variations in the olivine
   fabrics in the trench peridotites could result from variations in
   deformation within the supra-subduction uppermost mantle, possibly
   related to evolution of the mantle since the subduction initiation of
   the Pacific plate. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A model is presented for the development of the thermodynamic functions
   of enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs energy for the elements carbon and
   sulfur in coke crystallites. The crystallites of various degrees of
   graphitization may be described by crystallite length L (a) and
   crystallite height L (c). This carbon/sulfur model has been developed
   using concepts similar to those in the carbon/hydrogen model for coke
   crystallites. The major model parameters are derived from reported
   thermodynamic properties. Approximately 75 pct of the model parameters
   for the carbon/hydrogen and carbon/sulfur system are parameters common
   to both systems. The resulting crystallite size (L (a)) constrained in
   the carbon/sulfur phase diagram, computed by a Gibbs energy minimization
   technique, is presented for 1 atm and temperatures between 1500 K and
   2500 K (1227 A degrees C and 2227 A degrees C). A very good agreement is
   obtained between the predicted thermal desulfurization of petroleum
   cokes and critically assessed experimental data. The removal of sulfur
   from coke crystallites is predicted to occur mostly between 1600 K and
   1850 K (1327 A degrees C and 1577 A degrees C) at 1 atm, depending on
   the L (a) value. The precision in the predictive calculations and the
   transferability of the model parameters are two aspects that tend to
   support the usefulness and the theoretical basis of the entire approach.

   as a part of the setup activity at the beginning of each lot production,
   while a major maintenance (overhaul) is undertaken once the proportion
   of defectives in a rejected lot reaches or exceeds a given threshold.
   The main objective of this study is to jointly optimize the production
   lot size, the inventory threshold, the sampling plan parameters and the
   overhaul threshold by minimizing the total incurred cost. To meet
   customer requirements, the optimization problem is subject to a
   specified constraint on the average outgoing quality limit (AOQL). A
   stochastic mathematical model is developed and solved using a
   simulation-based optimization approach. Numerical examples and thorough
   sensitivity analyses are provided to illustrate the efficiency of the
   proposed integrated model. Compared with the 100\% inspection policy
   which is widely used in the literature on integrated production,
   maintenance and quality control, the results obtained show that an
   economic design of acceptance sampling in such an integrated context can
   lead to important cost savings of more than 20\%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider an energy provider whose goal is to
   simultaneously set revenue-maximizing prices and meet a peak load
   constraint. The problem is cast within a bilevel setting where the
   provider acts as a leader (upper level) that takes into account a smart
   grid (lower level) that minimizes the sum of users' disutilities. The
   latter bases its actions on the hourly prices set by the leader, as well
   as the preference schedules set by the users for each task. We consider
   both the monopolistic and competitive situations, and validate
   numerically the potential of this approach to achieve an `optimal'
   trade-off between three conflicting objectives: revenue, user cost and
   peak demand. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of crystallographic preferred orientations (CPO) and
   calculations of P- and S-wave velocities,(V-p and V-s) and anisotropy
   were conducted on three quartz-mica schists and one felsic mylonite,
   which are representative of typical metamorphic rocks deformed in the
   middle crust beneath the southeastern Tibetan plateau. Results show that
   the schists have V-p anisotropy (AV(p)) ranging from 16.4\% to 25.5\%
   and maximum V-s anisotropy {[}AV(s)(max)] between 21.6\% and 37.8\%. The
   mylonite has lower AV(p) and AV(s)(max) but slightly higher foliation
   anisotropy, which are 13.2\%, 18.5\%, and 3.07\%, respectively, due to
   the lower content and CPO strength of mica. With increasing mica
   content, the deformed rocks tend to form transverse isotropy (TI) with
   fast velocities in the foliation plane and slow velocities normal to the
   foliation. However, the presence of prismatic minerals (e.g, amphibole
   and sillimanite) forces the overall symmetry to deviate from TI. An
   increase in feldspar content reduces the bulk anisotropy caused by mica
   or quartz because the fast-axis of feldspar aligns parallel to the
   slow-axis of mica and/or quartz. The effect of quartz on seismic
   properties of mica-bearing rocks is complex, depending on its content
   and prevailing slip system. The greatest shear-wave splitting and
   fastest V-p both occur for propagation directions within the foliation
   plane, consistent with the fast Pms (S-wave converted from P-wave at the
   Moho) polarization directions in the west Yunnan where
   mica/amphibole-bearing rocks have developed pervasive subvertical
   foliation and subhorizontal lineation. The fast Pms directions are
   perpendicular to the approximately E-W orienting fast SKS (S-wave
   traversing the core as P-wave) directions, indicating a decoupling at
   the Moho interface between the crust and mantle beneath the region. The
   seismic data are inconsistent with the model of crustal channel flow as
   the latter should produce a subhorizontal foliation where vertically
   incident shear waves suffer little splitting. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Evidence of sub-10 nm aluminum-oxygen precipitates in silicon}},
Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{20}},
Month = {{MAY 20}},
Abstract = {{In this research, ultraviolet laser-assisted atom-probe tomography (APT)
   was utilized to investigate precisely the behavior at the atomistic
   level of aluminum impurities in ultrathin epitaxial silicon layers.
   Aluminum atoms were incorporated in situ during the growth process. The
   measured average aluminum concentration in the grown layers exceeds by
   several orders of magnitude the equilibrium bulk solubility.
   Three-dimensional atom-by-atom mapping demonstrates that aluminum atoms
   precipitate in the silicon matrix and form nanoscopic precipitates with
   lateral dimensions in the 1.3 to 6.2 nm range. These precipitates were
   found to form only in the presence of oxygen impurity atoms, thus
   providing clear evidence of the long-hypothesized role of oxygen and
   aluminum-oxygen complexes in facilitating the precipitation of aluminum
   in a silicon lattice. The measured average aluminum and oxygen
   concentrations in the precipitates are similar to 10. +/- 0.5 at.\% and
   similar to 4.4 +/- 0.5 at.\%, respectively. This synergistic interaction
   is supported by first-principles calculations of the binding energies of
   aluminum-oxygen dimers in silicon. The calculations demonstrate that
   there is a strong binding between aluminum and oxygen atoms, with
   Al-O-Al and O-Al-Al as the energetically favorable sequences
   corresponding to precipitates in which the concentration of aluminum is
   twice as large as the oxygen concentration in agreement with APT data.}},

Abstract = {{The annual dairy transportation problem involves designing the routes
   that collect milk from farms and deliver it to processing plants. The
   demands of these plants can change from one week to the next, but the
   collection is fixed by contract and must remain the same throughout the

   average demand from the plants, we show that including the information
   about plants demands leads to significant savings. We propose a
   two-stage method based on an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS).
   The first phase solves the transportation problem and the second phase
   ensures that the optimization of plant assignment is performed. An
   additional analysis based on period clustering is conducted to speed up

   Protocols for Multi-Centre Studies}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 12}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate two spinal cord
   (SC) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) protocols, implemented at multiple
   sites (using scanners from two different manufacturers), one available
   on any clinical scanner, and one using more advanced options currently
   available in the research setting, and to use an automated processing
   method for unbiased quantification. DTI parameters are sensitive to
   changes in the diseased SC. However, imaging the cord can be technically
   challenging due to various factors including its small size,
   patient-related and physiological motion, and field inhomogeneities.
   Rapid acquisition sequences such as Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) are
   desirable but may suffer from image distortions. We present a
   multi-centre comparison of two acquisition protocols implemented on
   scanners from two different vendors (Siemens and Philips), one using a
   reduced field-of-view (rFOV) EPI sequence, and one only using options
   available on standard clinical scanners such as outer volume suppression
   (OVS). Automatic analysis was performed with the Spinal Cord Toolbox for
   unbiased and reproducible quantification of DTI metrics in the white
   matter. Images acquired using the rFOV sequence appear less distorted
   than those acquired using OVS alone. SC DTI parameter values obtained
   using both sequences at all sites were consistent with previous
   measurements made at 3T. For the same scanner manufacturer, DTI
   parameter inter-site SDs were smaller for the rFOV sequence compared to
   the OVS sequence. The higher inter-site reproducibility (for the same
   manufacturer and acquisition details, i.e. ZOOM data acquired at the two
   Philips sites) of rFOV compared to the OVS sequence supports the idea
   that making research options such as rFOV more widely available would
   improve accuracy of measurements obtained in multi-centre clinical
   trials. Future multi-centre studies should also aim to match the rFOV
   technique and signal-to-noise ratios in all sequences from different
   manufacturers/sites in order to avoid any bias in measured DTI
   parameters and ensure similar sensitivity to pathological changes.}},

Title = {{Cysteamine broadly improves the anti-plasmodial activity of artemisinins
   against murine blood stage and cerebral malaria}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{MAY 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: The potential emergence and spread of resistance to
   artemisinins in the Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasite constitutes a
   major global health threat. Hence, improving the efficacy of
   artemisinins and of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT)
   represents a major short-term goal in the global fight against malaria.
   Mice defective in the enzyme pantetheinase (Vnn3) show increased
   susceptibility to blood-stage malaria (increased parasitaemia, reduced
   survival), and supplementation of Vnn3 mutants with the reaction product
   of pantetheinase, cysteamine, corrects in part the
   malaria-susceptibility phenotype of the mutants. Cysteamine (Cys) is a
   small, naturally occurring amino-thiol that has very low toxicity in
   vivo and is approved for clinical use in the life-long treatment of the
   kidney disorder nephropathic cystinosis.
   Methods: The ability of Cys to improve the anti-plasmodial activity of
   different clinically used artemisinins was tested. The effect of
   different CYS/ART combinations on malarial phenotypes (parasite
   blood-stage replication, overall and survival from lethal infection) was
   assessed in a series of in vivo experiments using Plasmodium strains
   that induce either blood-stage (Plasmodium chabaudi AS) or cerebral
   disease (Plasmodium berghei ANKA). This was also evaluated in an ex vivo
   experimental protocol that directly assesses the effect of such drug
   combinations on the viability of Plasmodium parasites, as measured by
   the ability of tested parasites to induce a productive infection in vivo
   in otherwise naive animals.
   Results: Cys is found to potentiate the anti-plasmodial activity of
   artesunate, artemether, and arteether, towards the blood-stage malaria
   parasite P. chabaudi AS. Ex vivo experiments, indicate that potentiation
   of the anti-plasmodial activity of artemisinins by Cys is direct and
   does not require the presence of host factors. In addition, potentiation
   occurs at sub-optimal concentrations of artemisinins and Cys that on
   their own have little or no effect on parasite growth. Cys also
   dramatically enhances the efficacy and protective effect of artemisinins
   against cerebral malaria induced by infection with the P. berghei ANKA
   parasite.
   Conclusion: These findings indicate that inclusion of Cys in current
   formulations of ACT, or its use as adjunct therapy could improve the
   anti-plasmodial activity of artemisinin, decrease mortality in cerebral
   malaria patients, and prevent or delay the development and spread of
   artemisinin resistance.}},

Abstract = {{We report on real time observations of the sublimation of exfoliated
   black phosphorus layers throughout annealing using in situ low energy
   electron microscopy. We found that sublimation manifests itself above
   375 +/- 20 degrees C through the nucleation and expansion of asymmetric,
   faceted holes with the long axis aligned along the {[}100] direction and
   sharp tips defined by edges consisting of alternating (10) and (11)
   steps. This thermally activated process repeats itself via successive
   sublimation of individual layers. Calculations and simulations using
   density functional theory and kinetic Monte Carlo allowed to determine
   the involved atomic pathways. Sublimation is found to occur via
   detachments of phosphorus dimers rather than single atoms. This behavior
   and the role of defects is described using an analytical model that
   captures all essential features. This work establishes an
   atomistic-level understanding of the thermal stability of exfoliated
   black phosphorus and defines the temperature window available for
   material and device processing.}},

Title = {{Effects of olivine fabric, melt-rock reaction, and hydration on the
   seismic properties of peridotites: Insight from the Luobusha ophiolite
   in the Tibetan Plateau}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In order to constrain the effects of olivine fabric, melt-rock reaction,
   and hydration on the seismic properties and anisotropy of mantle rocks,
   we investigated serpentinized peridotites from the Luobusha ophiolite in
   the Indus-Tsangpo suture of the Tibetan Plateau. A-type and almost
   random olivine crystal-preferred orientations (CPO) occur in harzburgite
   and dunite samples, respectively. The dunite resulted from interactions
   of harzburgite with boninitic melt at similar to 800-970 degrees C,
   yielding pyroxene dissolution and olivine precipitation. The olivine
   neoblasts formed from the melt-rock reaction show no evidence of
   dislocation creep and developed almost random CPO. Hence, the melt-rock
   reaction reduced seismic anisotropy. Our results together with those
   from the literature indicate that A-, B-, C-, D-, and E-type CPOs of
   olivine generally induce V-p anisotropy patterns with Vp (X)> V-p(Y)>
   V-p(Z), V-p(Y)> V-p(X)> V-p(Z), V-p(Z)> V-p(X)> V-p(Y), V-p(X)> V-p(Y)
   approximate to V-p(Z), and V-p(X) > V-p(Z)> Vp(Y), respectively. The
   effect of serpentinization was calibrated by the comparison of seismic
   velocities and anisotropy measured up to 600 MPa with the values
   calculated from the CPO data. Although the low-temperature (LT, < 300
   degrees C) serpentinization (lizardite and chrysotile) decreases V-p by
   similar to 6-10\% and V-s by similar to 12\%, it does not change the
   anisotropy pattern because the mesh-texture characterized by serpentine
   veins perpendicular to the principal structural directions (X, Y, and Z)
   reduces the velocities in these orthogonal directions to almost equal
   extent. Thus, the magnitude of seismic anisotropy alone cannot be used
   as an indicator of the degree of LT serpentinization in the mantle
   rocks. Furthermore, Birch's law is found to hold when peridotites
   undergo serpentinization.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we develop an analytical framework for personalizing the
   anticoagulation therapy of patients who are taking warfarin. Consistent
   with medical practice, our treatment design consists of two stages: (i)
   the initiation stage, modeled using a partially-observable Markov
   decision process, during which the physician learns through systematic
   belief updates about the unobservable patient sensitivity to warfarin,
   and (ii) the maintenance stage, modeled using a Markov decision process,
   during which the physician relies on his formed belief about patient
   sensitivity to determine the stable, patient-specific, warfarin dose to
   prescribe. We develop an expression for belief updates in the POMDP,
   establish the optimality of the myopic policy for the MDP, and derive
   conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a myopically optimal
   dose. We validate our models using a real-life patient data set gathered
   at the Hematology Clinic of the Jewish General Hospital in Montreal. The
   proposed analytical framework and case study enable us to develop useful
   clinical insights, for example, concerning the length of the initiation
   period and the importance of correctly assessing patient sensitivity.}},

Abstract = {{The replacement of traditional molecular surfactants by nano- or
   micrometer-sized solid particles in emulsification processes offers many
   advantages and new opportunities for process industries. The
   solid-stabilization of emulsions occurs in three steps: (1) the
   particles first approach and contact.the fluid/fluid interface, (2) the
   particles adsorb to and are trapped at the interface, and (3) the
   adsorbed particles form a network that stabilizes the emulsion. The
   current state of knowledge makes process design impossible or
   impracticable, mainly because of the lack of information on the overall
   stabilization mechanism. A colloidal probe technique (atomic force
   microscopy) was used to measure the adsorption force and time of model
   glass and polyethylene microspheres to a planar silicone oil/water
   interface. Particle approach, contact, adsorption, and detachment as
   well as adsorption time were studied. Force curves revealed that a
   repulsive force is involved during approach and contact and an
   attractive force is involved during adsorption. Particle properties
   governed the approach, contact, adsorption, and detachment steps, and
   oil viscosity had a significant impact on the contact force and
   adsorption time. Aqueous phase pH and salinity had no significant effect
   on the adsorption and detachment time but were involved during the
   approach step through their effect the electrostatic double layer force.

Abstract = {{Oximetry measurement of principal retinal vessels represents a first
   step towards understanding retinal metabolism, but the technique could
   be significantly enhanced by spectral imaging of the fundus outside of
   main vessels. In this study, a recently developed Hyperspectral Retinal
   Camera was used to measure relative oximetric (SatO(2)) and total
   hemoglobin (HbT) maps of the retina, outside of large vessels, in
   healthy volunteers at baseline (N = 7) and during systemic hypoxia (N =
   11), as well as in patients with glaucoma (N = 2). Images of the retina,
   on a field of view of similar to 30 degrees, were acquired between 500
   and 600 nm with 2 and 5 nm steps, in under 3 s. The reflectance spectrum
   from each pixel was fitted to a model having oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin as
   the main absorbers and scattering modeled by a power law, yielding
   estimates of relative SatO(2) and HbT over the fundus. Average optic
   nerve head (ONH) saturation over 8 eyes was 68 +/- 5\%. During systemic
   hypoxia, mean ONH saturation decreased by 12.5\% on average. Upon
   further development and validation, the relative SatO(2) and HbT maps of
   microvasculature obtained with this imaging system could ultimately
   contribute to the diagnostic and management of diseases affecting the
   ONH and retina. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Gross Motor Function Measure Evolution Ratio: Use as a Control for

Abstract = {{Objective: To develop a new way to interpret Gross Motor Function
   Measure (GMFM-66) score improvement in studies conducted without control
   groups in children with cerebral palsy (CP).
   Design: The curves, which describe the pattern of motor development
   according to the children's Gross Motor Function Classification System
   level, were used as historical control to define the GMFM-66 expected
   natural evolution in children with CP. These curves have been modeled
   and generalized to fit the curve to particular children characteristics.
   Setting: Research center.
   Participants: Not applicable. Interventions: Not applicable.
   Mean Outcome Measures: Not applicable.
   Results: Assuming that the GMFM-66 score evolution followed the shape of
   the Rosenbaum curves, by taking into account the age and GMFM-66 score
   of children, the expected natural evolution of the GMFM-66 score was
   predicted for any group of children with CP who were <8 years old.
   Because the expected natural evolution could be predicted for a specific
   group of children with CP, the efficacy of a treatment could be
   determined by comparing the GMFM-66 score evolution measured before and
   after treatment with the expected natural evolution for the same period.
   A new index, the Gross Motor Function Measure Evolution Ratio, was
   defined as follows: Gross Motor Function Measure Evolution Ratio =
   measured GMFM-66 score change/expected natural evolution.
   Conclusions: For practical or ethical reasons, it is almost impossible
   to use control groups in studies evaluating effectiveness of many
   therapeutic modalities. The Gross Motor Function Measure Evolution Ratio
   gives the opportunity to take into account the expected natural
   evolution of the gross motor function of children with CP, which is
   essential to accurately interpret the therapy effect on the GMFM-66. (C)

Title = {{Impact of a short walking exercise on gait kinematics in children with
   cerebral palsy who walk in a crouch gait}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{34}},
Pages = {{18-21}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Background: Crouch gait results in an increase of the joint stress due
   to an excessive knee flexion. Daily walking exercises, even when
   performed at a self-selected speed, may result in a decrease of the
   extensor muscle strength which could lead to a more severe crouch gait
   pattern. The, aim of this study was to assess the impact of a short
   walking exercise on gait kinematics in children with cerebral palsy who
   walk with a crouch gait.
   Methods: Seven children with cerebral palsy who walk with a crouch gait
   were asked to walk for 6 min at a self-selected speed. The
   spatio-temporal and kinematic measures, as well as the center of mass
   position were compared before and after the exercise.
   Findings: There was no significant difference between walking speed
   before and after the walking exercise. Knee flexion and the maximal
   ankle dorsiflexion increased after the walking exercise. The vertical
   position of the center of mass decreased. No significant difference was
   found at the hip.
   Interpretation: Children with cerebral palsy who walk with a crouch gait
   were more crouched after a 6-min walking exercise performed at their
   self-selected speed. These gait modifications could be due to fatigue of
   the extensor muscle groups. This study highlighted that a short walking
   exercise, corresponding to daily mobility, results in gait pattern
   modifications. Since therapies in children with cerebral palsy aim to
   improve motor function in everyday life situations, it could be relevant
   to evaluate gait adaptation after a few minutes of walking exercise. (C)

Title = {{Toward valuable prediction of ERP diffusion in North American automotive
   industry: A simulation based approach}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{175}},
Pages = {{61-70}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Recent researches suggest that the decision to adopt an ERP system has
   implications outside of firm boundaries, and is likely to impact the
   adoption decision from stakeholders in the same industrial network.
   Being able to consider such phenomena, to reproduce the whole dynamic of
   the diffusion process and to validate empirical evidences can be
   determinant in the success of a new product introduction. This paper is
   intended to propose and validate a propagation model for the diffusion
   of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems among the North American
   automotive business network. Based on empirical evidence from the
   adoption of ERP by top 50 firms in the automotive sector from 1994-2005,
   a micro quantitative diffusion model is proposed. A simulation-based
   approach is employed to estimate the parameters of the proposed model to
   represent faithfully the observed diffusion phenomenon. The results show
   a robust diffusion model with a mean error less than 4\% and up to 92\%
   of similarity between the real ERP adopters data gathered through
   publicly available secondary databases and those obtained via
   simulations. Finally, the conducted validation experimentations show
   that when we progress in time the cumulative historical data minimizes
   the effort of estimation and future adopters' prediction is more
   effective. Discussion about the usefulness of the proposed model for ERP
   systems editors to test different strategies for market penetration is
   also conducted. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{We study a single-commodity robust network design problem (sRND) defined

   satisfied by a feasible single-commodity flow. We consider two ways of
   representing the uncertainty set, either as a finite list of scenarios
   or as a polytope. We propose a branch-and-cut algorithm to derive
   optimal solutions to sRND, built on a capacity-based integer linear
   programming formulation. It is strengthened with valid inequalities
   derived as -Chvatal-Gomory cuts. Since the formulation contains
   exponentially many constraints, we provide practical separation
   algorithms. Extensive computational experiments show that our approach
   is effective, in comparison to existing approaches from the literature

Abstract = {{Metallic nanoparticles are routinely used as nanoscale antenna capable
   of absorbing and converting photon energy with subwavelength resolution.
   Many applications, notably in nanomedicine and nanobiotechnology,
   benefit from the enhanced optical properties of these materials, which
   can be exploited to image, damage, or destroy targeted cells and
   subcellular structures with unprecedented precision. Modern inorganic
   chemistry enables the synthesis of a large library of nanoparticles with
   an increasing variety of shapes, composition, and optical
   characteristic. However, identifying and tailoring nanoparticles
   morphology to specific applications remains challenging and limits the
   development of efficient nanoplasmonic technologies. In this work, we
   report a strategy for the rational design of gold plasmonic nanoshells
   (AuNS) for the efficient ultrafast laser-based nanoscale bubble
   generation and cell membrane perforation, which constitute one of the
   most crucial challenges toward the development of effective gene therapy
   treatments. We design an in silico rational design framework that we use
   to tune AuNS morphology to simultaneously optimize for the reduction of
   the cavitation threshold while preserving the particle structural
   integrity. Our optimization procedure yields optimal AuNS that are
   slightly detuned compared to their plasmonic resonance conditions with
   an optical breakdown threshold 30\% lower than randomly selected AuNS
   and 13\% lower compared to similarly optimized gold nanoparticles
   (AuNP). This design strategy is validated using time-resolved bubble
   spectroscopy, shadowgraphy imaging and electron microscopy that confirm
   the particle structural integrity and a reduction of 51\% of the
   cavitation threshold relative to optimal AuNP. Rationally designed AuNS
   are finally used to perforate cancer cells with an efficiency of 61\%,
   using 33\% less energy compared to AuNP, which demonstrate that our
   rational design framework is readily transferable to a cell environment.
   The methodology developed here thus provides a general strategy for the
   systematic design of nanoparticles for nanomedical applications and
   should be broadly applicable to bioimaging and cell nanosurgery.}},

Abstract = {{Kaolin particles were dispersed in a PET (poly(ethylene terephthalate))
   matrix using a displacement procedure in which kaolin was initially
   treated with potassium acetate and, subsequently, melt-blended with PEO
   and PET. The disappearance of characteristic peaks in XRD patterns of
   chemically treated particles revealed that the crystalline form and
   layered structure of kaolin particles were mainly destroyed. Scanning
   electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy showed that the
   thickness of dispersed particles were generally in the range of 10-100
   nm. It was also observed that the dispersion level of the chemically
   treated kaolin was much better than that of as received kaolin
   particles. Rheological studies showed the formation of a network-like
   structure in samples containing the chemically treated kaolin as a
   result of improved dispersion of particles. It was also observed that
   both the kaolin particles and modifiers could accelerate the degradation
   process and lower the molecular weight of the PET. The introduction of
   kaolin particles shifted the crystallization temperatures of PET to
   higher temperatures. It was observed that the incorporation of a chain
   extender significantly restricted the crystallization process. The
   Avrami-Jeziorny analysis confirmed the alteration of the crystalline
   structure of the filled polymer. Based on TGA thermograms the
   decomposition temperature of PET-kaolin composites was slightly lower
   than that of the neat PET. POLYM. COMPOS., 37:1443-1452, 2016. (c) 2014

Abstract = {{An increase in food-borne illnesses in the United States has been
   associated with fresh produce consumption. Irrigation water presents
   recognized risks for microbial contamination of produce. Water quality
   criteria rely on indicator bacteria. The objective of this review was to
   collate and summarize experimental data on the relationships between
   pathogens and thermotolerant coliform (THT) and/or generic E. coli,
   specifically focusing on surface fresh waters used in or potentially
   suitable for irrigation agriculture. We analyzed peer-reviewed
   publications in which concentrations of E. coli or THT coliforms in
   surface fresh waters were measured along with concentrations of one or
   more of waterborne and food-borne pathogenic organisms. The proposed
   relationships were significant in 35\% of all instances and not
   significant in 65\% of instances. Coliform indicators alone cannot
   provide conclusive, non-site-specific and non-pathogen-specific
   information about the presence and/or concentrations of most important
   pathogens in surface waters suitable for irrigation. Standards of
   microbial water quality for irrigation can rely not only on
   concentrations of indicators and/or pathogens, but must include
   references to crop management. Critical information on microbial
   composition of actual irrigation waters to support criteria of
   microbiological quality of irrigation waters appears to be lacking and
   needs to be collected.}},

   Treatment: Influence of pH, Ionic Strength, and Hardness}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},

Abstract = {{Iron and manganese are commonly found in natural waters, particularly in
   groundwater. Because of the importance of particle size distribution
   (PSD) on the performance of removal processes, this research focuses on
   understanding the PSD and -potentials of oxidized iron/manganese in
   water, as a function of pH, ionic strength, and hardness. After rapid
   oxidation of dissolved iron/manganese, laser diffraction (LD), dynamic
   light scattering (DLS), and fractionation through serial membrane
   filtration techniques were used to define the PSD. For manganese
   dioxide, the -potential was found to decrease as the pH decreased and as
   the ionic strength and hardness increased, resulting in a higher
   aggregate size. The aggregation rate of manganese dioxide strongly
   increased with hardness. On the other hand, ferric hydroxide PSD was not
   significantly altered by ionic strength or hardness at pH values
   relevant to typical natural waters. A combination of several techniques
   was found to be essential for providing a complete picture of the PSD.
   The DLS and LD techniques were generally well adapted for nano-scale and
   micron-scale particles, respectively. The serial membrane filtration
   technique was suggested for water practitioners working toward the
   selection of an appropriate process for iron/manganese control in
   drinking waters. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate the potential of a bioactive coating based on
   chondroitin sulfate (CS) and tethered epidermal growth factor (EGF) for
   improvement of healing around stent grafts (SGs).
   Materials and Methods: The impact of the bioactive coating on cell
   survival was tested in vitro on human vascular cells using polyethylene
   terephthalate films (PET) as a substrate. After being transferred onto a
   more ``realistic{''} material (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene
   {[}ePTFE]), the durability and mechanical behavior of the coating and
   cell survival were studied. Preliminary in vivo testing was performed in
   a canine iliac aneurysm model reproducing type I endoleaks (three
   animals with one control and one bioactive SG for each).
   Results: CS and EGF coatings significantly increased survival of human
   smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts compared with bare PET or ePTFE (P <
   .05). The coating also displayed good durability over 30 days according
   to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and cell survival tests. The
   coating did not affect mechanical properties of ePTFE and was
   successfully transferred onto commercial SGs for in vivo testing. No
   difference was observed on computed tomography and macroscopic
   examinations in endoleak persistence at 3 months, but the bioactive
   coating deposited on the abluminal surface of the SG (exposed to the
   vessel wall) increased the percentage of healed tissue in the aneurysm.
   No adverse effect, such as neointima formation or thrombosis, was
   observed.
   Conclusions: The bioactive coating promoted in vitro cell survival,
   displayed good durability, and was successfully transferred onto a
   commercial SG. Preliminary in vivo results suggest improved healing
   around bioactive SGs.}},

Abstract = {{An ambitious project in propulsion was introduced as part of the
   final-year integrator project offerings of the mechanical and aerospace
   engineering programs at Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal in 2011-2012. It
   has been running successfully for the past three academic years. The
   project consists in the design, fabrication, and placement into service
   of a functional instrumented multistage compressor test rig, including
   the compressor, for research in compressor aerodynamics. A team of 15-17
   senior-year undergraduate engineering students is given a set of design
   and performance specifications and measurement requirements, an electric
   motor and drive, a data acquisition system, and some measurement probes.
   They must complete the project in two semesters with a budget on the
   order of Can\$15,000. The compressor is made from rapid prototyping to
   keep production cost and time reasonable. However, the required rotation
   speed of 7200 rpm stretches the limits of the plastic material and
   presents the same structural challenges as industrial compressors
   running at higher speeds. The students are split into subteams according
   to the required disciplines, namely, compressor aerodynamics, general
   aerodynamics, structures, dynamics, mechanical design and integration,
   instrumentation, and project management. For the initial phase, which
   covers the first two months, the students receive short seminars from
   experts in academia and industry in each discipline and use the
   knowledge from fundamental engineering courses to analytically model the
   different components to come up with a preliminary design. In the second
   phase, covering three to six, the students are trained at commercial
   simulation tools and use them for detailed analysis to refine and
   finalize the design. In each of the first two phases, the students
   present their work in design reviews with a jury made up of engineers
   from industry and supervising professors. During the final phase, the
   compressor is built and tested with data acquisition and motor control
   programs written by the students. Finally, the students present their
   results with comparison of measured performance with numerical and
   analytical predictions from the first two phases and hand over their
   compressor rig with design and test reports as well as a user manual and
   an assembly/maintenance manual. This complete project allows the
   students to put into practice virtually all the courses of their
   undergraduate engineering curriculum while giving them an extensive
   taste of the rich and intellectually challenging environment of gas
   turbine and turbomachinery engineering.}},

Title = {{Flatness-based adaptive fuzzy control of electrostatically actuated MEMS
   using output feedback}},
Journal = {{FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{290}},
Pages = {{138-157}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{The article presents an adaptive fuzzy control approach to the problem
   of control of electrostatically actuated MEMS, which is based on
   differential flatness theory and which uses exclusively output feedback.
   It is shown that the model of the electrostatically actuated MEMS is a
   differentially flat one and this permits to transform it to the
   so-called linear canonical form. For the new description of the system's
   dynamics the transformed control inputs contain unknown terms which
   depend on the system's parameters. To identify these terms an adaptive
   fuzzy approximator is used in the control loop. Thus an adaptive fuzzy
   control scheme is implemented in which the unknown or unmodeled system
   dynamics is approximated by neurofuzzy networks and next this
   information is used by a feedback controller that makes the
   electrostatically activated MEMS converge to the desirable motion
   setpoints. This adaptive control scheme is exclusively implemented with
   the use of output feedback, while the state vector elements which are
   not directly measured are estimated with the use of a state observer
   that operates in the control loop. The learning rate of the adaptive
   fuzzy system is suitably computed from Lyapunov analysis, so as to
   assure that both the learning procedure for the unknown system's
   parameters, the dynamics of the observer and the dynamics of the control
   loop will remain stable. The Lyapunov stability analysis depends on two
   Riccati equations, one associated with the feedback controller and one
   associated with the state observer. Finally, it is proven that for the
   control scheme that comprises the feedback controller, the state
   observer and the neurofuzzy approximator, an H-infinity tracking
   performance can be achieved. The functioning of the control loop has
   been evaluated through simulation experiments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This paper proposes models and algorithms for the pickup and delivery
   vehicle routing problem with time windows and multiple stacks. Each
   stack is rear-loaded and is operated in a last-in-first-out (LIFO)
   fashion, meaning that when an item is picked up, it is positioned at the
   rear of a stack. An item can only be delivered if it is in that
   position. This problem arises in the transportation of heavy or
   dangerous material where unnecessary handling should be avoided, such as
   in the transportation of cars between car dealers and the transportation
   of livestock from farms to slaughterhouses. To solve this problem, we
   propose two different branch-price-and-cut algorithms. The first solves
   the shortest path pricing problem with the multi-stack policy, while the
   second incorporates this policy partly in the shortest path pricing
   problem and generates additional inequalities to the master problem when
   infeasible multi-stack routes are encountered. Computational results
   obtained on instances derived from benchmark instances for the pickup
   and delivery traveling salesman problem with multiple stacks are
   reported, and reveal the advantage of incorporating the multi stack
   policy in the pricing problem. Instances with up to 75 requests and with
   one, two and three stacks can be solved optimally within 2 hours of
   computational time. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Association of European

Title = {{Coronary Stent Artifact Reduction with an Edge-Enhancing Reconstruction
   Kernel - A Prospective Cross-Sectional Study with 256-Slice CT}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 29}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   Metallic artifacts can result in an artificial thickening of the
   coronary stent wall which can significantly impair computed tomography
   (CT) imaging in patients with coronary stents. The objective of this
   study is to assess in vivo visualization of coronary stent wall and
   lumen with an edge-enhancing CT reconstruction kernel, as compared to a
   standard kernel.
   Methods
   This is a prospective cross-sectional study involving the assessment of
   71 coronary stents (24 patients), with blinded observers. After
   256-slice CT angiography, image reconstruction was done with
   medium-smooth and edge-enhancing kernels. Stent wall thickness was
   measured with both orthogonal and circumference methods, averaging
   thickness from diameter and circumference measurements, respectively.
   Image quality was assessed quantitatively using objective parameters
   (noise, signal to noise (SNR) and contrast to noise (CNR) ratios), as
   well as visually using a 5-point Likert scale.
   Results
   Stent wall thickness was decreased with the edge-enhancing kernel in
   comparison to the standard kernel, either with the orthogonal (0.97 +/-
   0.02 versus 1.09 +/- 0.03 mm, respectively; p< 0.001) or the
   circumference method (1.13 +/- 0.02 versus 1.21 +/- 0.02 mm,
   respectively; p = 0.001). The edge-enhancing kernel generated less
   overestimation from nominal thickness compared to the standard kernel,
   both with the orthogonal (0.89 +/- 0.19 versus 1.00 +/- 0.26 mm,
   respectively; p< 0.001) and the circumference (1.06 +/- 0.26 versus 1.13
   +/- 0.31 mm, respectively; p = 0.005) methods. The edge-enhancing kernel
   was associated with lower SNR and CNR, as well as higher background
   noise (all p < 0.001), in comparison to the medium-smooth kernel. Stent
   visual scores were higher with the edge-enhancing kernel (p< 0.001).
   Conclusion
   In vivo 256-slice CT assessment of coronary stents shows that the
   edge-enhancing CT reconstruction kernel generates thinner stent walls,
   less overestimation from nominal thickness, and better image quality
   scores than the standard kernel.}},

   interferometer. A cross-sectional analysis of the wear track was
   performed with SEM following focused ion beam milling. Focused ion beam
   milling revealed the deformation induced damages to the coatings. Cold
   sprayed substrate porosity, grain refinement and hardness were shown to
   play a significant role on the wear characteristics of HiPIMS deposited

Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental study of ReEF (TM) co-firing with
   coal in a pilot-scale PCB (pulverized coal boiler). ReEF (TM), or
   ReEngineered Feedstock (TM), is a novel fuel composed of both waste and
   alkaline sorbent, combining therefore the PCB emission control
   techniques of waste derived fuel co-firing and that of sorbent blending.
   The results show that ReEF (TM) co-firing resulted in a higher sorbent
   utilization and a higher sulfur emissions reduction than sorbent alone.
   Several combinations of calcium-based and sodium-based sorbents were
   tested at different stoichiometric ratios. Emissions of SO2, NOx and HCl
   at different feed compositions, furnace temperatures and air injection
   patterns were measured. SO2 emission reductions of up to 55\% were
   observed during experiments at gas residence time 4 times lower than
   that of pulverized coal boiler. The slagging propensity of the ashes in
   the reactor was also studied. Finally, a model was developed that
   satisfactorily predicted the experimental SO2 emissions. It was further
   applied to conditions typical of existing PCB. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Transient and harmonic response of a sandwich with partial constrained
   layer damping: A parametric study}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},

Pages = {{44-55}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to present a parametric study of PCLD (partial
   constraining layer damping) characteristics on the response of a
   rectangular plate. Both harmonic and transient regimes are considered.
   In harmonic response, natural frequencies and loss factors are studied,
   while in transient response, where the external force is an impact,
   displacement and acoustic pressure are analyzed. The governing equation
   is obtained from Lagrange's equations. The viscoelastic behaviour of the
   core, which depends on frequency, is represented by Prony series. Once
   obtained, the governing equation is solved in frequency domain using
   Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The solution is then converted back into
   time domain with the Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFY). The model
   was validated in our previous paper, Ref. {[}B. Khalfi and A. Ross,
   ``Transient Response of A Plate With Partial Constrained Viscoelastic
   Layer Damping,{''} International Journal of Mechanical Sciences,
   http://dx.doLorg/10.1016/Amecsci.2013.01.032, 2013] with experimental
   results, in this paper other validation with literature using a plate
   with PCLD is also made. The simulation results show that patch geometry
   has a significant effect on the vibration behaviour of the sandwich.
   Several conclusions were obtained: (a) Identification of the proportions
   of different layer thickness for optimal damping, (b) Definition of
   areas in the plate promoting maximum shear in the viscoelastic layer,
   (c) Existence of a relationship between loss factor and deformation
   mode. The originality of this work comes from the capacity of the model
   to study the influence of any input parameter on the behaviour of the
   sandwich in harmonic response as well as in transient response. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of blindness
   worldwide affecting individuals over the age of 50. The neovascular form
   (NV AMD) is characterized by choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and
   responsible for the majority of central vision impairment. Using
   non-biased microRNA arrays and individual TaqMan qPCRs, we profiled
   miRNAs in the vitreous humour and plasma of patients with NV AMD. We
   identified a disease-associated increase in miR-146a and a decrease in
   miR-106b and miR-152 in the vitreous humour which was reproducible in
   plasma. Moreover, miR-146a/miR-106b ratios discriminated patients with
   NV AMD with an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve
   (ROC AUC) of 0,977 in vitreous humour and 0,915 in plasma suggesting
   potential for a blood-based diagnostic. Furthermore, using the AMD Gene
   Consortium (AGC) we mapped a NV AMD-associated SNP (rs1063320) in a
   binding site for miR-152-3p in the HLA-G gene. The relationship between
   our detected miRNAs and NV AMD related genes was also investigated using
   gene sets derived from the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). To our
   knowledge, our study is the first to correlate vitreal and plasma miRNA
   signatures with NV AMD, highlighting potential future worth as
   biomarkers and providing insight on NV AMD pathogenesis.}},

Title = {{Joint torque variability and repeatability during cyclic
   flexion-extension of the elbow}},
Journal = {{BMC SPORTS SCIENCE MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{APR 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: Joint torques are generally of primary importance for
   clinicians to analyze the effect of a surgery and to obtain an indicator
   of functional capability to perform a motion. Given the current need to
   standardize the functional evaluation of the upper limb, the aim of this
   paper is to assess (1) the variability of the calculated maximal elbow
   joint torque during cyclic elbow flexion-extension movements and (2)
   participant test-retest repeatability in healthy young adults.
   Calculations were based on an existing non-invasive method including
   kinematic identification and inverse dynamics processes.
   Methods: Twelve healthy young adults (male n = 6) performed 10 elbow
   flexion-extension movement carrying five different dumbbells (0, 1, 2, 3
   and 4 kg) with several flexion-extension frequencies (1/2, 1/3, 1/4 Hz)
   to evaluate peak elbow joint torques.
   Results: Whatever the condition, the variability coefficient of trial
   peak torques remained under 4 \%. Bland and Altman plot also showed good
   test-retest, whatever the frequency conditions for the 0, 1, 2, and 3 kg
   conditions.
   Conclusion: The good repeatability of the flexion-extension peak torques
   represents a key step to standardize the functional evaluation of the
   upper limb.}},

Abstract = {{Spinal loads are recognized to play a causative role in back disorders
   and pain. Knowledge of lumbar spinal loads is required in proper
   management of various spinal disorders, effective risk prevention and
   assessment in the workplace, sports and rehabilitation, realistic
   testing of spinal implants as well as adequate loading in in vitro
   studies. During the last few decades, researchers have used a number of
   techniques to estimate spinal loads by measuring in vivo changes in the
   intradiscal pressure, body height, or forces and moments transmitted via
   instrumented vertebral implants. In parallel, computational models have
   been employed to estimate muscle forces and spinal loads under various
   static and dynamic conditions. Noteworthy is the increasing growth in
   latter computational investigations.
   This paper aims to review, compare and critically evaluate the existing
   literature on in vivo measurements and computational model studies of
   lumbar spinal loads to lay the foundation for future biomechanical
   studies. Towards this goal, the paper reviews in separate sections
   models dealing with static postures (standing, sitting, lying) as well
   as slow and fast dynamic activities (lifting, sudden per-turbations and
   vibrations). The findings are helpful in many areas such as work place
   safety design and ergonomics, injury prevention, performance
   enhancement, implant design and rehabilitation management. (C) 2016

Title = {{Fluid-flow dependent response of intervertebral discs under cyclic
   loading: On the role of specimen preparation and preconditioning}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{6, SI}},

Month = {{APR 11}},
Abstract = {{In vivo during the day, intervertebral discs are loaded mainly in
   compression causing fluid and height losses that are subsequently fully
   recovered overnight due to fluid inflow under smaller compression.
   However, in vitro, fluid flow through the endplates, in particular fluid
   imbibition, is hampered possibly by blood clots formed post mortem.
   Despite earlier in vitro studies, it remains yet unclear if and how
   fluid flow conditions in vitro could properly emulate those in vivo.
   Effects of various preload magnitudes (no preload, 0.06 and 0.28 MPa)
   and disc-bone preparation conditions (e.g., w/o bony endplates) on disc
   height and nucleus pressure were investigated using 54 bovine specimens.
   Changes in specimen height and pressure at different nucleus locations
   were used as surrogate measures to assess the fluid content and flow
   within the discs.
   Under all investigated preparation conditions and preload magnitudes, no
   significant pressure recovery could be obtained during low loading
   phases, even without bony endplates. On the contrary, partial to full
   displacement recovery were reached in particular under 0.28 MPa preload.
   Results highlight the significant role of disc preload magnitude in disc
   height recovery during low loading periods. Attention should hence be
   given in future studies to the proper selection of preload magnitude and
   duration as well as the animal models used if in vivo response is
   intended to be replicated. Findings also indicate that flushing the
   endplates or injection of bone cement respectively neither facilitates
   nor impedes fluid flow into or out of the disc to a noticeable degree in
   this bovine disc model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Unstable sitting on a wobble chair with different balance difficulty
   levels can be used as an effective tool in exercises as well as
   evaluation and therapeutic stages of rehabilitation. No data on muscle
   activity levels and spinal loads are however available to assess its
   safety compared to other regular daily activities. The goal of this
   study was to estimate muscle forces and spinal loads in a seated
   unstable wobble chair task. In vivo 3D kinematics of the trunk and seat
   collected in an earlier study were used here to drive computational
   trunk musculoskeletal models of 6 normal and 6 low-back pain subject
   groups sitting on a wobble chair for a duration of 10 s. Results
   revealed no significant differences between kinematics, muscle forces,
   spinal loads and force plate reaction forces when comparing these two
   groups. The estimated muscle forces and spinal loads were moderate
   though larger than those in a stationary sitting posture. Local spinal
   forces at the L5-S1 disc varied with time and reached their peaks (1473
   N and 1720 N in compression, 691 N and 687 N in posterior-anterior shear
   and 153 N and 208 N in right-left shear, respectively for healthy and
   CLBP groups) being much greater relative to those in the stationary
   sitting posture (means of 12 subjects: 768 N, 284 N and 0 N,
   respectively). The wobble chair with characteristics considered in this
   study is found hence safe enough as a therapeutic exercise for both
   healthy and low-back pain subjects. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Nowadays in various daily, occupational and training activities, there
   are many occasions with forces supported in hands acting at various
   magnitudes, elevations, and orientations with substantial horizontal
   components. In this work, we aim to compute trunk muscle forces,
   stability, and spinal loads under pulling external forces applied at 3
   elevations and 13 orientations. Under an identical upright standing
   posture and upper body weight, the trunk active-passive response is
   computed using a validated iterative finite element kinematics-driven
   model. Pulling forces of 80, 120, and 160 N are resisted symmetrically
   in both hands held at 20, 40, and 60 cm elevations above the L5-S1 and
   oriented each in upward (-90), inclined upward (-75 degrees,-60
   degrees,-45 degrees,-30 degrees, and -15 degrees), horizontal (0
   degrees), inclined downward (15 degrees, 30 degrees, 45 degrees, 60
   degrees, and 75 degrees) and finally downward in gravity direction (90).
   In addition, in all analyses, an antagonist moment of 10 N m is applied
   in order to generate rather small antagonist coactivity and
   intra-abdominal pressures of 8-12 kPa are considered when abdominal
   muscles are active under upward pulling forces. Results demonstrated
   substantial differences in muscular response, spinal loads, and
   stability margin as the pulling force elevation, orientation, and
   magnitude altered. Compression and shear forces at lower lumbar levels
   peaked under forces at higher elevations acting with downward
   inclinations. Minimum spinal forces were computed at all elevations
   under pulling forces in the upward direction. Trunk stability was also
   maximum under these latter forces pulling upward. These findings have
   important consequences in rehabilitation, training, and design of safer
   occupational activities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of an automated method for arterial input function detection
   for first-pass myocardial perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Background: Quantitative assessment of myocardial blood flow (MBF) with
   first-pass perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) requires a
   measurement of the arterial input function (AIF). This study presents an
   automated method to improve the objectivity and reduce processing time
   for measuring the AIF from first-pass perfusion CMR images. This
   automated method is used to compare the impact of different AIF
   measurements on MBF quantification.
   Methods: Gadolinium-enhanced perfusion CMR was performed on a 1.5 T
   scanner using a saturation recovery dual-sequence technique. Rest and
   stress perfusion series from 270 clinical studies were analyzed.
   Automated image processing steps included motion correction, intensity
   correction, detection of the left ventricle (LV), independent component
   analysis, and LV pixel thresholding to calculate the AIF signal. The
   results were compared with manual reference measurements using several
   quality metrics based on the contrast enhancement and timing
   characteristics of the AIF. The median and 95 \% confidence interval
   (CI) of the median were reported. Finally, MBF was calculated and
   compared in a subset of 21 clinical studies using the automated and
   manual AIF measurements.
   Results: Two clinical studies were excluded from the comparison due to a
   congenital heart defect present in one and a contrast administration
   issue in the other. The proposed method successfully processed 99.63 \%
   of the remaining image series. Manual and automatic AIF time-signal
   intensity curves were strongly correlated with median correlation
   coefficient of 0.999 (95 \% CI {[}0.999, 0.999]). The automated method
   effectively selected bright LV pixels, excluded papillary muscles, and
   required less processing time than the manual approach. There was no
   significant difference in MBF estimates between manually and
   automatically measured AIFs (p = NS). However, different sizes of
   regions of interest selection in the LV cavity could change the AIF
   measurement and affect MBF calculation (p = NS to p = 0.03).
   Conclusion: The proposed automatic method produced AIFs similar to the
   reference manual method but required less processing time and was more
   objective. The automated algorithm may improve AIF measurement from the
   first-pass perfusion CMR images and make quantitative myocardial
   perfusion analysis more robust and readily available.}},

Abstract = {{Critical thermodynamic evaluations and optimizations of the AgCl-CoCl2,
   AgCl-InCl3, AgCl-NaCl, InCl3-NaCl and CoCl2-InCl3 systems were carried
   out in the present work within the framework of the CALPHAD approach.
   The molten salt phase was described by the Modified Quasi-chemical
   Model, while the Compound Energy Formalism with various lattice ratios
   was used to treat the terminal solid solutions. The two binary double
   salts (Na3InCl6 and Ag3InCl6) were treated as the stoichiometric
   compounds of which Gibbs energies were modelled following the
   Neumann-Kopp rule. All the model parameters were optimized in terms of
   the required phase equilibria and thermochemical data arising from
   experimental measurements and theoretical predictions (First-principles
   method and empirical equation). A set of self-consistent thermodynamic
   database for the AgCl-CoCl2-InCl3-NaCl quaternary system was finally
   derived by merging the Gibbs energies for relevant phases in all binary
   systems (model parameters of CoCl2-NaCl were adopted from the
   literature) based upon the Kohler-Toop interpolation technique in order
   to facilely calculate various phase equilibria and thermodynamic
   properties of the sub-ternary and quaternary systems. The calculated
   results involving multicomponent systems will support beneficial
   instructions in the related industrial processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{367-383}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In the present work, we seek to understand the fundamental mechanisms of
   three-dimensional reconfiguration of plants by studying the large
   deformation of a flexible rod in fluid flow. Flexible rods made of
   polyurethane foam and reinforced with nylon fibers are tested in a wind
   tunnel. The rods have bending-torsion coupling which induces a torsional
   deformation during asymmetric bending. A mathematical model is also
   developed by coupling the Kirchhoff rod theory with a semi-empirical
   drag formulation. Different alignments of the material frame with
   respect to the flow direction and a range of structural properties are
   considered to study their effect on the deformation of the flexible rod
   and its drag scaling. Results show that twisting causes the flexible
   rods to reorient and bend with the minimum bending rigidity. It is also
   found that the Vogel exponent of a reconfiguring rod is not affected by
   torsion. Finally, using a proper set of dimensionless numbers, the state
   of a bending and twisting rod is characterized as a beam undergoing a
   pure bending deformation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The complete penetration magnetic field B-P is the main feature of a
   superconducting pellet submitted to an axial applied magnetic field. The
   electric E-J characteristics of HTS bulk is generally described by a
   power law E(J) = E-C(J/JC)(n). The influence of the n-value and applied
   magnetic field rise rate V-b on the B-P of a HTS cylindrical pellet has
   been presented in a previous paper. The numerical results presented come
   from a numerical resolution of a nonlinear diffusion problem. With the
   help of these simulations, a linear relationship between B-P, ln V-b,
   and n-value has been deduced. This comparison allows determining the
   critical current density J(C) and the n-value of the power law based on
   direct measurement of B-P in the gap between two bulk HTS pellets. In
   this paper, an improvement of this method is presented. The influence of
   geometric parameters R and L is studied to give generality to the
   relationship between B-P, V-b, and n-value. A previous B-P formula is
   confirmed by these new simulations. To correctly connect simulation and
   experimental results, the influence of spacing e between bulks is
   studied and presented. A relationship between B-P and measured complete
   penetration magnetic field B-PM is determined.}},

   direct-conversion to the baseband with no external local oscillator (LO)
   source (self-mixing), nor RF frequency conversion into IF frequency,
   therefore significantly reducing its power consumption. Up-link
   communication (tag-to-reader communication) is performed by
   up-converting the tag's data using the same SOM. Furthermore, the
   in-phase injected energy stabilizes the self-generated LO and enhances
   the SOM phase noise, resulting into a low-phase noise baseband signal.
   Using a standard 65-nm CMOS process, a 40-GHz zero-IF SOM was designed,
   fabricated, and tested. Experimental results exhibit a conversion loss
   of about 30 dB under -38-dBm injected RF power with a power consumption
   of only 280 mu W during reader-to-tag communication, and 580 mu W during
   tag-to-reader communication.}},

Abstract = {{Airline companies are subject to a considerable amount of disruption
   during operation. It is vital for many industries to predict the source
   of disruption in different levels of management, in order to reduce the
   recovery cost. One of the most important and costly sources of
   disruption in the airline industry is the number of reserve pilots.
   We devise a supervised learning method, based on decision trees, to
   predict total monthly pilot reserve hours. The proposed method uses
   characteristics of the monthly schedule as factors and an iterative
   algorithm to make a prediction. The model is tested on real data and a
   substantial improvement is observed in the results compared to the
   current state of the practice in the domain in which a seasonal linear
   trend decomposition is employed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the numerical simulation of void formation and
   transport during mold filling in Resin Transfer Molding (RTM). The
   saturation equation, based on a two-phase flow model resin/air, is
   coupled with Darcy's law and mass conservation to simulate the
   unsaturated filling flow that takes place in a RTM mold when resin is
   injected through the fiber bed. These equations lead to a system
   composed of an advection-diffusion equation for saturation including
   capillary effects and an elliptic equation for pressure taking into
   account the effect of air residual saturation. The model introduces the
   relative permeability as a function of resin saturation. When capillary
   effects are omitted, the hyperbolic nature of the saturation equation
   and its strong coupling with Darcy equation through relative
   permeability represent a challenging numerical issue. The combination of
   the constitutive physical laws relating permeability to saturation with
   the coupled system of the pressure and saturation equations allows
   predicting the saturation profiles. The model was validated by
   comparison with experimental data obtained for a fiberglass
   reinforcement injected in a RTM mold at constant flow rate. The
   saturation measured as a function of time during the resin impregnation
   of the fiber bed compared very well with numerical predictions.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of liquid phase rheology on the local hydrodynamics of
   bubble column reactors operating with non-Newtonian liquids are
   investigated. Local bubble properties, including bubble frequency,
   bubble chord length, and bubble rise velocity, are measured by placing
   two in-house made optical fiber probes at various locations within a
   bubble column reactor operating with different non-Newtonian liquids. It
   was found that the presence of elasticity can noticeably increase the
   bubble frequency but decreases the bubble chord length and its rise
   velocity. The radial profiles of bubble frequency, bubble chord length,
   and bubble rise velocity are shown to be relatively flat at low
   superficial gas velocity while they become parabolic at high superficial
   gas velocity. Moreover, the bubble size and gas holdup are correlated
   with respect to dimensionless groups by considering the ratio between
   dynamic moduli of viscoelastic liquids. The novel proposed correlations
   are capable of predicting the experimental data of bubble size and gas
   holdup within a mean absolute percentage error of 9.3\% and 10\%,

Abstract = {{Socially responsible investment (SRI) in France is based on a best in
   class approach as opposed to the exclusion approaches used in other
   countries such as the United States or United Kingdom, where the
   rejection of sin stocks has been dominant historically. The objective of
   this research note is to examine whether the French SRI market, by
   focusing more on financial rather than on ethical considerations,
   compared with other countries such as the United States, the United
   Kingdom, or even Sweden, may lead to a form of mainstreaming of SRI
   processes. The authors explore several convergent mechanisms. First, the
   authors analyze the importance of the mainstreaming issue in the history
   of SRI as well as in the contemporaneous debate in the academic
   literature on the links between financial and extrafinancial (SRI)
   performance. Second, the authors review the role played by ethical
   finance laws adopted in France in the early 2000s in the development of
   the SRI market. Finally, the authors discuss the results of a survey of
   French SRI analysts working both for large institutional investors and
   asset managers in France in 2009.}},

Abstract = {{The present study aims to transform a treated soil (TS) into a more
   desirable resource by modifying physico-chemical properties via
   amendments while reducing toxic metals' mobility and oral
   bioaccessibility. A hydrocarbon-contaminated soil submitted to treatment
   (TS) but still containing elevated concentrations of Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn
   has been amended with compost, sand, and Al-2(SO4)(3) to render it
   usable for horticulture. Characterization and sequential extraction were
   performed for TS and four amended mixtures (AM1-4). P and K availability
   and metal bioaccessibility were investigated in TS and AM2. Amendment
   improved soil properties for all mixtures and yielded a usable product
   (AM2 20 \% TS, 49 \% compost, 30 \% sand, 1 \% Al2(SO4)3) satisfying
   regulatory requirements except for Pb content. In particular, AM2 had
   improved organic matter (OM) and cation exchange capacity (CEC). highly
   increased P and K availability, and reduced total metal concentrations.
   Furthermore, amendment decreased metal mobile fraction likely to be
   plant-available (in mg kg(-1). assumed as soluble/exchangeable +
   carbonates fractions). For AM2, estimated Pb bioavailability decreased
   from 1.50 x 10(3) mg kg(-1) (TS) to 238 mg kg(-1) (52.4 \% (TS) to 34.2
   \%). Bioaccessible concentrations of Cu, Ni, and Zn (mg kg 1)were lower
   in AM2 than in TS, but there was no significant decrease for Pb. The
   results suggest that amendment improved soil by modifying its chemistry,
   resulting in lower metal mobile fraction (in A, for Cu and Zn) and
   bioaccessibility (in A, for Cu only). Amending soils having residual
   metal contamination can be an efficient valorization method, indicating
   potential for reducing treatment cost and environmental burden by
   rendering disposal/additional treatment unnecessaiy. Further studies
   including plant bioavailability are recommended to confirm results.}},

Abstract = {{The solution of traveling-wave equations for transient analysis of
   transmission lines and cables requires the identification of propagation
   function and characteristic admittance. A given modal propagation
   function can be approximated as a rational transfer function associated
   with an exponential time delay term. Time delays should be properly
   assigned prior to fitting in order to compensate excessive phase lag and
   avoid poor fitting results. In this paper, the existing time delay
   calculation formula of the universal line model (ULM) is first
   demonstrated using the Bode's magnitude-phase relation and its error
   source is explained. The underlying assumption is that a modal
   propagation function is a minimum phase system once a suitable time
   delay is removed. However, the numerical implementation of the procedure
   can generate delays that result in high fitting errors. Then, this paper
   contributes to a new method for estimating time delays and improving
   propagation function fitting accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the difficult problem of joint product family and

   sub-assembly and component substitution possibilities are considered.
   For the supply chain network, facility and distribution center location
   are considered as well as the choice of suppliers. A Mixed Integer
   Linear Program (MILP) model is proposed. The MILP formulation is solved
   optimally for medium-sized instances. For larger instances, two
   heuristics derived from the MILP are designed. These methods are
   computationally tested on various instances from a generator conceived
   for this purpose. The modelling of product substitution possibilities
   through product transformation permits the solving of large size
   instances that are now adequate for real problems. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{Simulation of non-linear coregionalization models by FFTMA}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& GEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{89}},
Pages = {{220-231}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A fast and efficient method to simulate multivariate fields with
   non-linear models of coregionalization (N-LMC) is described. The method
   generalizes FFTMA to the multivariate simulation of the N-LMC with
   symmetric cross-covariances, hence the name GFFTMA. It allows us for
   example to use an exponential model as the direct covariance for the
   main variable, a Cauchy model for the secondary variable and a K-Bessel
   model for the cross-covariance. Each covariance and cross-covariance are
   Fast Fourier Transformed (FFT) to get the discrete spectral densities.
   Then the spectral matrix is eigen-decomposed at each frequency
   separately to provide the square root matrix and to enforce
   positive-definiteness in cases where small negative eigenvalues are
   found. Finally the simulated spectrum is obtained as multiplication of
   the root matrix and the white noise coefficients. The method is
   particularly fast for covariances having derivatives at the origin
   and/or for covariances with long range. Hence, two-variables' 2D fields
   of 100 million pixels with all-Gaussian or all-cubic covariances and
   cross-covariance are both simulated in less than 200 s. The CPU-time
   increases only as N log(N) (N, the number of points to simulate).
   Additional realizations are obtained at a low marginal cost as the
   eigen-decomposition step needs to be done only once for the first
   realization. The main limitation of the approach is its rather stringent
   memory requirement. Synthetic examples illustrate the simulations of
   N-LMC with two and three variables for different combinations of the
   seven available models. It shows that the theoretical models are all
   well reproduced. An illustrative case-study on overburden thickness
   simulation is provided where the secondary information consists of a
   latent Gaussian variable identifying the geological domain. (C) 2016

Title = {{Spatial turning bands simulation of anisotropic non-linear models of
   coregionalization with symmetric cross-covariances}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& GEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{89}},
Pages = {{232-238}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The turning bands method (TBM) is a commonly used method of simulation
   for large Gaussian fields, its O(N) complexity being unsurpassed (N
   denotes the number of points to simulate). TBM can be implemented either
   in the spatial or the spectral domains. In the multivariate anisotropic
   case, spatial versions of TBM are currently available only for the
   linear model of coregionalization (LMC). For anisotropic non-LMC with
   symmetrical covariances only the spectral version is currently
   available. The spectral domain approach can be slow in the case of
   non-differentiable covariances due to the numerous frequencies to
   sample. Here a derivation of the equations is provided for simulating
   the anisotropic non-LMC directly in the spatial domain and the method is
   illustrated with two synthetic examples. The approach allows the
   specification of many different direct and cross-covariance components,
   each with possibly different geometric anisotropies and different model
   types. The complexity of the new multivariate approach remains O(N).
   Hence, a case of two variables defining an anisotropic non-LMC is
   simulated over one billion points in less than one hour on a desktop
   computer. These results help enlarge the scope of application of the
   TBM. The method can be easily implemented in any existing TBM program.

Abstract = {{In health monitoring of complex mechanical systems such as aircraft
   engines there are many components whose diagnosis is of great interest
   for the industry. A conventional way to monitor these components is to
   collect vibration signals using accelerometers placed in their closest
   vicinity. However, due to some restrictions such as inaccessibility, it
   is not always practical to place the accelerometers as such. In many
   cases, pre-installed instrumentations are used, which are usually
   inadequate and placed on the carcass of the structure. Nevertheless,
   even if the accelerometers are positioned very close to the components,
   they would collect signals not just from one specific component but from
   other components as well. In this study, we sought to employ
   frequency-based independent component analysis (ICA) to recover the
   signals produced by components within a single complex system. In such a
   case, differences between blind source separation and vibration source
   separation are discussed. A new workaround for the permutation ambiguity
   encountered in the implication of ICA is proposed. Finally, in order to
   demonstrate the applicability of the new proposed approach, experimental
   results carried out on a test bed are presented.}},

Abstract = {{This study was set out to investigate the impacts of Combined Sewer
   Overflows (CSOs) on the microbiological water quality of a river used as
   a source of drinking water treatment plants. Escherichia coli
   concentrations were monitored at various stations of a river segment
   located in the Greater Montreal Area including two Drinking Water
   Intakes (DWIs) in different weather conditions (dry weather and wet
   weather (precipitation and snowmelt period)). Long-term monitoring data
   (2002-2011) at DWIs revealed good microbiological water quality with E.
   coli median concentrations of 20 and 30 CFU/100 mL for DWI-1 and DWI-2
   respectively. However, E. coli concentration peaks reached up to 510 and
   1000 CFU/100 mL for both DWIs respectively. Statistical Process Control
   (SPC) analysis allowed the identification of E. coli concentration peaks
   in almost a decade of routine monitoring data at DWIs. Almost 80\% of
   these concentrations were linked to CSO discharges caused by
   precipitation exceeding 10 mm or spring snowmelt.
   Dry weather monitoring confirmed good microbiological water quality. Wet
   weather monitoring showed an increase of approximately 1.5 log of E.
   coli concentrations at DWIs. Cumulative impacts of CSO discharges were
   quantified at the river center with an increase of approximately 0.5 log
   of E. coli concentrations. Caffeine (CAF) was tested as a potential
   chemical indicator of CSO discharges in the river and CAF concentrations
   fell within the range of previous measurements performed for surface
   waters in the same area (similar to 20 ng/L). However, no significant
   differences were observed between CAF concentrations in dry and wet
   weather, as the dilution potential of the river was too high. CSO event
   based monitoring demonstrated that current bi-monthly or weekly
   compliance monitoring at DWIs underestimate E. coli concentrations
   entering DWIs and thus, should not be used to quantify the risk at DWIs.
   High frequency event-based monitoring is a desirable approach to
   establish the importance and duration of E. coli peak concentrations
   entering DWIs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is a challenging optimization
   problem for CP and OR that has many industrial applications. Its
   generalization to the degree constrained minimum spanning tree problem
   (DCMSTP) is being intensively studied by the OR community. In
   particular, classical solution techniques for the TSP are being
   progressively generalized to the DCMSTP. Recent work on cost-based
   relaxations has improved CP models for the TSP. However, CP search
   strategies have not yet been widely investigated for these problems. The
   contributions of this paper are twofold. We first introduce a natural
   generalization of the weighted cycle constraint (WCC) to the DCMSTP. We
   then provide an extensive empirical evaluation of various search
   strategies. In particular, we show that significant improvement can be
   achieved via our graph interpretation of the state-of-the-art Last
   Conflict heuristic.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we present a wood procurement problem that arises in
   Eastern Canada. We solve a multi-period wood supply planning problem,
   while taking into account bucking decisions. Furthermore, we present a
   new form of flexibility which allows the harvesting capacity to change
   from one time period to another. We study the impact of such flexibility
   upon the harvesting cost. We assess the performance of the problem by
   comparing it with a variant where the harvesting capacity is fixed
   during sites' harvesting. To address this problem, we develop a hybrid
   approach based on both constraint and mathematical programming. In the
   first phase, we propose a constraint programming model dealing with
   forest sites harvesting and bucking problems. The result of this model
   is used as part of an initial solution for the whole problem formulated
   as a mixed integer model. We test the two versions of the problem on a
   set of different demand instances and we compare their results.}},

   compact if the colors of the edges incident to every vertex form a set

Title = {{Effect of periodic underloads on fatigue crack growth in three steels
   used in hydraulic turbine runners}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{40-48}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The aim of the present work is to study the interaction between two
   loading cycles in hydraulic turbine runners, i.e. baseline cycles which
   are the result of power output variations and periodic underloads which
   correspond to runner start/stop sequences. In order to make better
   evaluations of fatigue lives, there is a need to determine the real
   crack growth as compared to those predicted by linear damage summation.
   This comparison is made for three wrought steels, AISI 415, ASTM A516,
   and AISI 304L. Fatigue tests were run under both constant amplitude
   loading and periodic underloads at two constant values of maximum stress
   intensity factor, K-max. The crack growth under periodic underloads was
   faster than that predicted by linear damage summation for the A516 and
   304L steels, while almost no acceleration was found for the 415 steel.
   The acceleration factors reached the highest values under low K-max and
   high load ratio of baseline cycles. High tensile residual stresses and
   strain hardening at the crack tip caused by underloads contribute to
   crack growth acceleration during the subsequent baseline cycles. (C)

Abstract = {{We present results on the deposition of plasma polymer (PP) films in a
   dielectric barrier discharge system fed with mixtures of argon or
   nitrogen carrier gas plus different hydrocarbon precursors, where the
   latter possess different carbon-to-hydrogen ratios: CH4 < C2H6 < C2H4 =
   C3H6 < C2H2. The influence of precursor gas mixture and flow rate,
   excitation frequency, and absorbed power on PP film compositions and
   properties has been investigated. The discharge was characterized by
   electrical measurements, while the chemical compositions and structures
   of coatings were analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,
   Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, total combustion, and elastic
   recoil detection analyses, the latter two for determining
   carbon-to-hydrogen ratios. Scanning electron microscopy was used to
   study the coatings' morphology, and profilometry for evaluating
   deposition rates. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Coupling light between an optical fiber and a silicon nanophotonic
   waveguide is a challenge facing the field of silicon photonics to which
   various mode converters have been proposed. Inverted tapers stand out as
   a practical solution enabling efficient and broadband mode conversion.
   Current design approaches often use linearly-shaped tapers and two
   dimensional approximations; however, these approaches have not been
   rigorously verified and there is not an overarching design framework to
   guide the design process. Here, using a Lagrangian formulation, we
   propose an original, constant-loss framework for designing
   shape-controlled photonic devices and apply this formalism to derive an
   ideal constant-loss taper (CLT). We specifically report on the
   experimental demonstration of a fabrication-tolerant, 15-mu m-long CLT
   coupler, that produces 0.56 dB fiber-chip coupling efficiency, the
   highest efficiency-per-length ratio ever reported. (C) 2016 Optical

Abstract = {{A novel feed system for circular arrays enabling beam steering over 360
   degrees in the azimuth plane with a stable scanned beam is proposed. It
   consists of rotating and fixed parts. The rotating part is a
   two-dimensional offset fed parabolic reflector which is inside a
   circular parallel plate waveguide. The power coming from the rotating
   part is coupled with the elements of the circular array through a fixed
   coupling structure. The rotating part is light and its moment of inertia
   is significantly less than the conventional rotating antenna systems for
   beam scanning. Therefore, the beam can be steered much faster than the
   current rotating antenna systems. The details of the structure including
   the rotating and the fixed parts are presented and a design procedure
   for the fixed coupling section is suggested. The performance of the feed
   system is investigated by simulations and measurements. It is shown that
   the simulations and experimental results are in good agreement.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of elevated pressure on the hydrodynamics of a pilot-scale
   bubble column reactor has been studied in the non-Newtonian liquid
   phase. Various hydrodynamic characteristics of the bubble column reactor
   including the total gas holdup and its axial distribution, operating
   flow regime transition point, pressure fluctuation and its standard
   deviation have been evaluated by means of several pressure traducers
   along the column height. The superficial gas velocity and operating
   pressure varied from 1 to 35 (cm s(-1)) and 0.1 to 1.0 (MPa),
   respectively. It was found that the total gas holdup increases with an
   increase in the operating pressure. The operating flow regime transition
   point was shifted to higher superficial gas velocities at elevated
   pressures. The standard deviation of pressure fluctuations was also
   found to increase with operating pressure but to decrease with the
   elasticity of the liquid phase. A new correlation has also been
   developed to predict the gas holdup in bubble columns operating at
   elevated pressures. The new correlation was shown to be able to predict
   the experimental data of gas holdup within a mean absolute percentage
   error of 20\%. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Gastrocnemius is a premier muscle crossing the knee, but its role in
   knee biomechanics and on the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) remains
   less clear when compared to hamstrings and quadriceps. The effect of
   changes in gastrocnemius force at late stance when it peaks on the knee
   joint response and ACL force was initially investigated using a lower
   extremity musculoskeletal model driven by gait kinematicskinetics. The
   tibiofemoral joint under isolated isometric contraction of gastrocnemius
   was subsequently analyzed at different force levels and flexion angles
   (0 degrees-90 degrees). Changes in gastrocnemius force at late stance
   markedly influenced hamstrings forces. Gastrocnemius acted as ACL
   antagonist by substantially increasing its force. Simulations under
   isolated contraction of gastrocnemius confirmed this role at all flexion
   angles, in particular, at extreme knee flexion angles (0 degrees and 90
   degrees). Constraint on varus/valgus rotations substantially decreased
   this effect. Although hamstrings and gastrocnemius are both knee joint
   flexors, they play opposite roles in respectively protecting or loading
   ACL. Although the quadriceps is also recognized as antagonist of ACL, at
   larger joint flexion and in contrast to quadriceps, activity in
   gastrocnemius substantially increased ACL forces (anteromedial bundle).
   The fact that gastrocnemius is an antagonist of ACL should help in
   effective prevention and management of ACL injuries.}},

Abstract = {{Despite aerospace industries are moving toward circular economy and
   reutilization of materials and components, every year hundreds of
   aircrafts end up in landfills without an appropriate treatment. This is
   mainly due to the lack of a proper design for end-of-life. New
   innovative approaches should be considered at the design phase with
   remarkable attention to disassembly aspect at the time of retirement.
   Considering disassembly as a multi-criteria decision-making problem,
   several parameters may influence the performance of a disassembly-task.
   Taking the experience accumulated during the disassembly work on a
   Bombardier Regional Jet aircraft, five parameters were considered in
   this study. A hybrid design of experiment (DOE) and TOPSIS method was
   proposed in order to obtain a unique discriminant disassembly model to
   calculate the disassemblability index for each two given components. The
   results from ANOVA showed that the derived disassembly model has a
   94.30\% of reliability. The application of the proposed model at the
   design phase could facilitate the evaluation of disassembly operation at

Abstract = {{Ultrashort pulsed lasers can provide high peak intensity with low pulse
   fluence. This makes them an ideal choice in photothermal therapy and
   applications where damage to the surrounding material needs to be
   minimized. Depending on the peak intensity, the ultrashort pulsed
   laser's interaction with matter can lead to plasma formation through
   nonlinear effects such as multiphoton and impact electron excitation.
   The capability of the spherical gold nanoparticles, as the most employed
   nanoparticle so far for photothermal therapy, to enhance and strongly
   localize the incident laser field leads to plasma formation around the
   particles at even lower pulse fluences. Under certain circumstances,
   during the pulse duration, this plasma can absorb more energy than the
   nanoparticle itself. Consequently, the absorbed energy by the generated
   plasma can act as an energy source for different phenomena such as the
   evolution of the temperature distribution, thermoelastic stress
   generation, and stress-induced bubble formation. In this paper, we study
   the plasma-mediated interaction of a 45 fs pulsed laser with two types
   of spherical gold nanoparticles in water: solid nanoparticle and
   core-shell (silica-gold) nanoparticle. We use a numerical framework
   based on the finite element method (FEM) to compare energy deposition
   profiles in these nanoparticles and in their surrounding plasma, by
   focusing on the impact of the nanoparticle size and the laser fluence.
   Our calculations show that the maximum energy deposition in plasma
   occurs in core-shell nanoparticles with a diameter of 130 nm and the
   ratio of core to shell radius of 0.8 and in solid nanoparticles with a
   diameter of 170 nm.}},

Title = {{Void fraction influence on added mass in a bubbly flow}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MECHANICS B-FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{28-45}},
Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a relation for the added mass coefficient of
   spherical bubbles depending on void fraction based on results obtained
   by a semi-analytical method.
   This information is essential to completely characterize finely
   dispersed bubbly flows, where small spherical gas bubbles are present in
   a continuous liquid phase. Most of the closure relations for Euler-Euler
   or Euler-Lagrange models are obtained from experiments involving single
   bubbles. Their applicability to systems with high void fraction is
   therefore questionable.
   This paper uses solid harmonics to solve 3D potential flow around
   bubbles. Several configurations were calculated for different numbers of
   particles and spatial configurations. Our results are compared with
   previous studies. Depending on the model proposed by previous authors,
   added mass forces could increase or decrease with void fraction. This
   paper solves these discrepancies by underlining the effect of induced
   added mass.
   The main purpose of this work is to develop simple formulas fitting our
   semi-analytical results. These simple formulas are suitable for further
   use, particularly as added mass models for multiphase flow averaged
   equations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a computational and analytical study to identify and
   elucidate fundamental flow features associated with the desensitization
   of performance and aerodynamic stability of an axial compressor rotor to
   tip clearance change. Parametric studies of various design changes to a
   baseline double circular arc airfoil axial rotor led to the
   identification of two flow features associated with reducing sensitivity
   to tip clearance, namely, high incoming meridional momentum in the tip
   region and reduction/elimination of double tip leakage. Numerical
   experiments were subsequently performed on the baseline rotor geometry
   to validate these two flow features and explain the associated flow
   physics by variations in incoming meridional momentum and pitch size.
   Finally, two designs were proposed, namely, a full forward chordwise
   sweep (FFCS) rotor and a rotor with gradual stagger angle reduction in
   the outer span, to exploit these flow features. The results indicated
   that both designs produce the intended flow effects and exhibit lower
   sensitivity of performance and aerodynamic stability to tip clearance.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents the developments of novel mesh generation algorithms
   over complex glaze-ice shapes containing multicurvature ice-accretion
   geometries, such as single/double ice horns. The twofold approaches
   tackle surface geometry discretization as well as field mesh generation.
   First, an adaptive curvilinear curvature control algorithm is
   constructed, solving a one-dimensional elliptic partial differential
   equation with periodic source terms. This method controls the arc length
   grid spacing, so that high convex and concave curvature regions around
   ice horns are appropriately captured, and is shown to effectively treat
   the grid shock problem. Second, a novel blended method is developed by
   defining combinations of source terms with two-dimensional elliptic
   equations. The source terms include two common control functions,
   Sorenson and Spekreijse, and an additional third source term to improve
   orthogonality. This blended method is shown to be very effective for
   improving grid quality metrics for complex glaze-ice meshes with
   Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes resolution. The performance in terms of
   residual reduction per nonlinear iteration of several solution
   algorithms (point-Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, alternating direction implicit,
   point, and line Successive Over-Relaxation) are discussed within the
   context of a full multigrid operator. Details are given on the various
   formulations used in the linearization process. It is shown that this
   performance of the solution algorithm depends on the type of control
   function used. Finally, the algorithms are validated on standard complex
   experimental ice shapes, demonstrating the applicability of the methods.}},

Title = {{Postoperative 3D spine reconstruction by navigating partitioning
   manifolds}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1045-1056}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The postoperative evaluation of scoliosis patients undergoing
   corrective treatment is an important task to assess the strategy of the
   spinal surgery. Using accurate 3D geometric models of the patient's
   spine is essential to measure longitudinal changes in the patient's
   anatomy. On the other hand, reconstructing the spine in 3D from
   postoperative radiographs is a challenging problem due to the presence
   of instrumentation (metallic rods and screws) occluding vertebrae on the
   spine.
   Methods: This paper describes the reconstruction problem by searching
   for the optimal model within a manifold space of articulated spines
   learned from a training dataset of pathological cases who underwent
   surgery. The manifold structure is implemented based on a multilevel
   manifold ensemble to structure the data, incorporating connections
   between nodes within a single manifold, in addition to connections
   between different multilevel manifolds, representing subregions with
   similar characteristics.
   Results: The reconstruction pipeline was evaluated on x-ray datasets
   from both preoperative patients and patients with spinal surgery. By
   comparing the method to ground-truth models, a 3D reconstruction
   accuracy of 2.24 +/- 0.90 mm was obtained from 30 postoperative
   scoliotic patients, while handling patients with highly deformed spines.
   Conclusions: This paper illustrates how this manifold model can
   accurately identify similar spine models by navigating in the
   low-dimensional space, as well as computing nonlinear charts within
   local neighborhoods of the embedded space during the testing phase. This
   technique allows postoperative follow-ups of spinal surgery using
   personalized 3D spine models and assess surgical strategies for spinal
   deformities. (C) 2016 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.}},

Title = {{MRI pallidal signal in children exposed to manganese in drinking water}},
Journal = {{NEUROTOXICOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{53}},
Pages = {{124-131}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background: Manganese (Mn) can have neurotoxic effects upon
   overexposure. We previously reported poorer cognitive and motor
   development in children exposed to Mn through drinking water, suggesting
   possible neurotoxic effects from Mn in water. Hyperintensity in the
   globus pallidus (GP) on Ti-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   indicates excessive brain Mn accumulation. Previous studies have
   reported GP hyperintensity related to Mn exposure in occupationally
   exposed individuals. However, no study has used MRI in children exposed
   to Mn in drinking water and who show no sign of overt intoxication.
   Objective: To examine MRI signal intensity in the GP in children exposed
   to contrasted levels of Mn in drinking water.
   Methods: We enrolled 13 children exposed to low Mn concentration in
   water and 10 children (ages 9-15 years) with high concentration (median
   of 1 and 145 mu g/L, respectively). We calculated three MRI T1 indexes:
   (i) standard pallidal index (PI) using frontal white matter as
   reference; (ii) PI using pericranial muscles as reference; and (iii) T1
   relaxation time. Each MRI index was compared between exposure groups,
   and with respect to the estimated Mn intake from water consumption.
   Results: The standard PI did not differ between Mn-exposure groups.
   However, children in the group with high water-Mn concentration had
   significantly lower pericranial muscles PI than those with lower
   exposure and, accordingly, higher T1 relaxation time. Mn intake from
   water consumption was not correlated with the standard PI, but was
   significantly related to the pericranial muscles PI and Tl relaxation
   time. Motor performance was significantly lower in the high-exposure
   group.
   Conclusion: We observed lower signal intensity in the GP of children
   with higher exposure to Mn from drinking water. This result stands in
   contrast to previous MRI reports showing GP hyperintensity with greater
   Mn exposure. Differences in exposure pathways are discussed as a
   potential explanation for this discrepancy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Increasing customer demand for durable and functional apparel
   manufactured in a sustainable manner has created an opportunity for
   nanomaterials to be integrated into textile substrates. Nanomoieties can
   induce stain repellence, wrinkle-freeness, static elimination, and
   electrical conductivity to fibers-without compromising their comfort and
   flexibility. Nanomaterials also offer a wider application potential to
   create connected garments that can sense and respond to external stimuli
   via electrical, color, or physiological signals. This review discusses
   electronic and photonic nanotechnologies that are integrated with
   textiles and shows their applications in displays, sensing, and drug
   release within the context of performance, durability, and connectivity.
   Risk factors including nanotoxicity, nanomaterial release during
   washing, and environmental impact of nanotextiles based on life cycle
   assessments have been evaluated. This review also provides an analysis
   of nanotechnology consolidation in the textiles market to evaluate
   global trends and patent coverage, supplemented by case studies of
   commercial products. Perceived limitations of nanotechnology in the
   textile industry and future directions are identified.}},

   synchronized, co-registered and simultaneous imaging with all three
   modalities. Further ameliorations towards miniaturization include a
   custom lens for optimal compromise between orthogonal imaging geometries
   as well as a double-clad fiber coupler for increased throughput. Image
   quality and co-registration is demonstrated on freshly excised swine
   head and neck tissue samples to illustrate the complementarity of the
   techniques for identifying signature cellular and structural features.

Journal = {{IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{262-270}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) are currently used to provide broadband
   access to the Internet anytime and anywhere. Generally, WMNs consist of
   mesh routers equipped with one or more interfaces allowing connectivity
   to the Internet through gateways. To route traffic from sources to
   destinations, many routing protocols have been proposed in the
   literature. However, most of them take into account at most one metric
   (e.g., interferences, packet losses, and load at gateways). Moreover,
   almost all of these schemes consider only one type of interferences:
   interflow or intraflow. In this paper, we propose a new source routing
   and gateway selection scheme, which is called source-based routing
   (SBR), that improves the performance of WMNs. SBR uses a novel routing
   metric, which is a combination of packet losses, intraflow and interflow
   interferences, and load at gateways, to select best paths to reach
   selected gateways. Simulation results show that the proposed SBR
   improves the network performance and outperforms existing routing
   schemes, which are based on expected transmission count (ETX), nearest
   gateway (NG; i.e., shortest path to gateway), load at gateways (LG), or
   interference ratio (IR); more specifically, SBR yields 33\%, 26\%, 13\%,
   and 10\% more throughput compared with LG, ETX, NG, and IR,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we provide new insight on the influence of the precursor
   (CH4 vs. C2H2) on the mechanical properties of a-C:H coatings
   synthesized in a hybrid PECVD/PVD process. For a given set of plasma
   parameters, the films synthesized in CH4/Ar gas mixture are found harder
   than the ones prepared in C2H2/Ar atmosphere despite their lower sp(3)
   density and similar hydrogen content. This unusual behavior is
   attributed to different molecular organization of the polymeric network
   constituting the films. The latter is explained considering the
   influence of the chemical nature of the film-forming species on the
   cross-linking and branching degree of the films. The whole set of our
   results unambiguously demonstrates that additional factors than the
   sp(3) and hydrogen content have to be considered for explaining the
   mechanical properties of a-C:H layers.}},

Abstract = {{Optical integrated network (OIN) is a promising alternative to overcome
   the restrictions that electrical networks-on-chip (eNoCs) will face in
   the next generation of multiprocessor integrated systems due to
   electrical interconnects' physical limitations. OINs present a higher
   bandwidth and lower power consumption but their full capabilities are
   curbed by high latency controllers. Control techniques, such as circuit
   switching, impose a high latency to perform the correct network routing
   and a better solution must be found in order to fully utilize OINs. In
   this letter, we have designed and modeled a low-latency centralized
   controller (LUCC). For validation purposes, we modeled different
   Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI)-based optical interconnects that
   employ the proposed LUCC. We obtain a response time of only one clock
   cycle when using the LUCC, even when conflicts are found.}},

Abstract = {{We present in this paper two low-power high-impedance microelectrode
   array drivers (MEDs) dedicated for visual intracortical
   microstimulation. These output stages of a new microstimulator are
   highly configurable and able to deliver higher compliance voltage (20V
   for anodic and cathodic phases) across microelectrode-tissue interface
   impedance compared with previously reported designs. Each MED is
   featured with a high-voltage switch-matrix, 3.3V/20V current mirrors, an
   on-chip 32-bit serial-in parallel-out shift register, and the new
   forbidden state logic circuits. Both systems are able to deliver eight
   bipolar or 16 monopolar stimulation simultaneously. The first MED is
   able to deliver one stimulation current level and the second one
   provides four different current amplitudes simultaneously to 16
   electrodes. Two microchips have been designed and fabricated using
   Teledyne DALSA 0.8 mu m 5V/ 20v double-diffused
   metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (Teledyne DALSA
   Semiconductor, Bromont, Quebec, Canada) technology to meet the required
   high-voltage compliance. The nominal values of largest supply voltages
   are +/- 10V. The maximum stimulation current per input channel is 400A
   and per output channel through an emulated microelectrode impedance of
   100k is 100A. The measured output compliance voltage is 10V/phase
   (anodic or cathodic) for the specified supply voltages. Increment of
   supply voltages to +/- 13V allows 220A stimulation current per output
   channel enhancing the output compliance voltage up to 20V/phase. The
   measured quiescent power consumptions of the proposed microelectrode
   array drivers are 316 and 735W, respectively. Post-layout simulation and
   measurement results of two MEDs and comparison with other designs have
   been reported in this paper. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports an experimental investigation aiming to validate a
   predictive model of in-plane and transverse permeability for
   three-dimensional interlock fabrics as a function of fabric
   architecture. Composite specimens were fabricated and cut to conduct
   microscopic observations of pore dimensions for five three-dimensional
   interlock fabrics compressed to a fiber volume content of 58\%. The pore
   cross-section height and width, the number of pores and the pore
   tortuosity were measured to evaluate an average pore size and
   distribution along the warp and weft directions for each fabric
   considered. The changes of these geometrical parameters are analyzed as
   a function of the fabric structure. A previously developed permeability
   analytical model is applied using the geometrical characteristics
   derived from the experimental observations. This allows comparing the
   experimental permeability to the theoretical predictions of the model
   and to the values calculated by the same model from the experimentally
   observed pore dimensions at the considered fiber volume content of 58\%.
   The good agreement obtained in all cases between the measured and
   calculated values of permeability confirms the validity of the proposed
   analytical model.}},

Journal = {{OR SPECTRUM}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Pages = {{335-364}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In the early phases of projects, capacity planning is performed to
   assess the feasibility of the project in terms of delivery date,
   resource usage and cost. This tactical approach relies on an aggregated
   representation of tasks in work packages. At this level, aggressive
   project duration objectives are achieved by adopting work package
   overlapping policies that affect both workload and resource usage. In
   this article, we propose a mixed-time MILP model for project capacity
   planning with different possibilities for overlapping levels between
   work packages. In the model, the planning time horizon is divided into
   time buckets used to evaluate resource usage, while starting and ending
   times for work packages are continuous. The model was tested on a
   benchmark of 5 sets of 450 theoretical instances each. More than half of
   the tested instances were solved to optimality within 500 s. Results
   also show that, while overlapping is more beneficial for accelerating
   project delivery times, it can still have a positive impact on project
   cost by allowing a better distribution of workload. Finally, overlapping
   options seem to have less influence on the performance of the model than
   project slack or number of work packages.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed at characterizing the groundwater flow pattern in a
   semi-arid agricultural area in northern India crossed by an intermittent
   monsoon-controlled watercourse, the Najafgarh drain. More specifically,
   it focused on studying the impact of groundwater recharge from the
   riverbed to the regional aquifer using hydrogeochemical and isotopic
   data. Significant hydrogeochemical zonation was observed between the
   northern, central and southern sides of the drain, linked to different
   mineralization processes and mixings. Northward from the drain,
   groundwater was mainly brackish (4.1-23.4 mS/cm), due to dissolution of
   evaporites (halite and anhydrite). Southward fromthe drain, mostly fresh
   groundwater was found (from 0.5 to 2.3 mS/cm), revealing notable cation
   exchange processes. In the vicinity of the drain (central area),
   mineralization was intermediate (0.7-4 mS/cm) and groundwater showed low
   geochemical evolution, supposing a distinct origin. Stable isotopes of
   water (delta O-18, delta H-2) confirmed that central groundwater was not
   a simple mixing between northern and southern groundwater masses, but
   had a significant component of infiltrated surface water from the drain.
   Potentiometric data supported these findings and confirmed the
   contribution of the drain to the recharge of the aquifer, setting up a
   hydraulic barrier between north and south, despite surface water
   availability limited to the monsoon season and low hydraulic
   conductivity of the riverbed. This study demonstrates the value of the
   geochemical and isotopic analysis of groundwater to characterize
   groundwater flow pattern in peri-urban agricultural areas, especially
   surface water-groundwater interactions.}},

Abstract = {{We present an inversion tool for airborne gravity gradient data that
   yields a 3D density model using stochastic methods i.e. cokriging and
   conditional simulation. This method uses geostatistical properties of
   the measured gravity gradient to estimate a 3D density model whose
   gravity response fits the measured gravity gradient anomaly. Linearity
   between gravity gradient data and density allows estimation of the model
   (density) covariance using observed data, i.e. we adjust iteratively the
   density covariance matrix by fitting experimental and theoretical
   gravity gradient covariance matrices. Inversion can be constrained by
   including densities known at some locations. In addition we can explore
   various reasonable solutions that honour both the estimated density
   covariance model and the gravity gradient data using geostatistical
   simulation.
   The proposed method is first tested with two synthetic datasets
   generated from a sharp-boundary model and a smooth stochastic model
   respectively. The results show the method to be capable of retrieving
   models compatible with the true models; it also allows the integration
   of complex a priori information. The technique is then applied to
   gravity gradient survey data collected for the Geological Survey of
   Canada in the area of McFaulds Lake (Ontario, Canada) using the Falcon
   airborne gravity system. Unconstrained inversion returns a density model
   that is geologically plausible and the computed response exactly fits
   the observed gravity gradient anomaly.}},

Title = {{Joint economic design of production, continuous sampling inspection and

Abstract = {{Standard continuous sampling procedures and tables are conventionally
   applicable only to continuous production processes that are
   statistically `in-control'. Consequently, these standards cannot be used
   to control quality in deteriorating production processes. Moreover,
   existing continuous sampling models do not consider interactions with
   production, inventory and maintenance aspects. In this paper, we attempt
   to fill these gaps in the literature. We investigate the joint design
   and optimization of a type-1 continuous sampling plan (CSP-1),
   make-to-stock production and preventive maintenance of a stochastic
   production system subject to both quality and reliability
   deteriorations. Two models of CSP-1 are considered and compared: the
   classical CSP-1 as in the standard procedures, and a CSP-1 plan with a
   stopping rule that is combined with condition-based maintenance. For
   both models, the optimization problem is to minimize the total incurred
   cost under a constraint on the outgoing quality. A combination of
   mathematical formulation, simulation and optimization techniques is used
   to solve such stochastic and constrained problems. Numerical examples
   are given to illustrate the resolution approach and to highlight some
   interesting aspects in the interactions between production, inventory,
   quality, maintenance and reliability. The results obtained demonstrate
   that sampling inspection plans realize significant cost savings compared
   to the 100\% inspection which is commonly used in the literature of
   integrated models, and that using the CSP-1 with an inspection stopping
   rule for deteriorating processes is more cost-effective than the
   classical CSP-1. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fluorescent-based live/dead labelling combined with fluorescent
   microscopy is one of the widely used and reliable methods for assessment
   of cell viability. This method is, however, not quantitative. Many
   image-processing methods have been proposed for cell quantification in
   an image. Among all these methods, several of them are capable of
   quantifying the number of cells in high-resolution images with closely
   packed cells. However, no method has addressed the quantification of the
   number of cells in low-resolution images containing closely packed cells
   with variable sizes. This paper presents a novel method for automatic
   quantification of live/dead cells in 2D fluorescent low-resolution
   images containing closely packed cells with variable sizes using a mean
   shift-based gradient flow tracking. Accuracy and performance of the
   method was tested on growth plate confocal images. Experimental results
   show that our algorithm has a better performance in comparison to other
   methods used in similar detection conditions.
   Lay description In biology, it is frequently needed to count the number
   of live and dead cells in microscopic images. When processing large
   number of samples, automatic cell counting approaches become very
   useful. Most of the available viability tests results in fluorescent
   images. Therefore, many algorithms have been previously proposed for
   identifying and counting the number of cells in such images. Although
   several methods have been previously developed for cell segmentations in
   images with closely packed cells of various size and shapes, but most of
   them fail to identify cells in low-resolution images. The purpose of
   ours study was to develop and validate an algorithm based on gradient
   flow tracking, which is able to count the number of closely packed cells
   with different size and shapes in low resolution images. Our method is
   based on finding the centers of cells as an indicator of the number of
   cells in an image by detecting the intersection of gradient vectors. In
   comparison to other existing methods, our proposed algorithm resulted in
   a more accurate quantification of cells.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes the use of non-stationary covariance functions
   with compact support to estimate and simulate a random function. Based
   on the kernel convolution theory, the functions are derived by
   convolving hyperspheres in followed by a Radon transform. The order of
   the Radon transform controls the differentiability of the covariance
   functions. By varying spatially the hyperspheres radius one defines
   non-stationary isotropic versions of the spherical, the cubic and the
   penta-spherical models. Closed-form expressions for the non-stationary
   covariances are derived for the isotropic spherical, cubic, and
   penta-spherical models. Simulation of the different non-stationary
   models is easily obtained by weighted average of independent standard
   Gaussian variates in both the isotropic and the anisotropic case. The
   non-stationary spherical covariance model is applied to estimate the
   overburden thickness over an area composed of two different geological
   domains. The results are compared to the estimation with a single
   stationary model and the estimation with two stationary models, one for
   each geological domain. It is shown that the non-stationary model
   enables a reduction of the mean square error and a more realistic
   transition between the two geological domains.}},

Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{A combination of tensile tests, three-point bending tests, compressive

   composite sandwich panels. This experimental analysis revealed that the
   tensile and flexural properties of sandwich structures remain unaltered
   when discontinuities of 2 mm are introduced in the core or small
   viscoelastic patches are inserted between face sheet plies. However,
   compressive properties are significantly reduced by the presence of such
   core or skin modifications. Finally, the energy absorbed during low
   velocity impact increases with increase interleaved viscoelastic film
   and increasing core discontinuity. Thus a special care must be taken at
   the early design stage to protect such vulnerable areas. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Iatrogenic injuries to paraspinal muscles during the posterior lumbar
   surgery (PLS) cause a reduction in their cross-sectional areas (CSAs)
   and contractile densities over time post-surgery. This study aims to
   quantify such alterations.
   Pre- and postoperative CSAs (similar to 6 months interval) of all
   paraspinal muscles were measured in six patients undergoing PLS using a
   3-T magnetic resonance (MR) scanner to quantify the alterations in
   geometrical and tissue effective contractile (non-fatty) CSAs of these
   muscles at all lumbar levels. To examine the presence of any confounding
   effects on recorded changes within similar to 7-month period,
   measurements were also carried out on ten healthy volunteers.
   In the healthy population, an important (similar to 22 \%) portion of
   CSA of the erector spinae (ES) was noncontractile at the lower lumbar
   levels. Negligible variations over time in both the total geometrical (<
   1.7 \% in average) and contractile (< 1.2 \%) CSAs of muscles were
   observed in the healthy group (i.e., no confounding effect). Following
   PLS, significant reductions were observed in the geometrical CSA of only
   multifidus (MF) muscle by similar to 14 and 11 \% as well as in its
   contractile CSA by similar to 26 and 14 \% at the L5-S1 and L4-L5
   levels, respectively.
   The total CSA of ES at lower lumbar levels shows substantial
   noncontractile contents in both healthy and patient populations.
   Biomechanical models of the spine should hence account for the
   noncontractile contents using only the effective contractile muscle
   CSAs. Postoperative variations in CSAs of paraspinal muscles may have
   profound effects on patterns of muscle activities, spinal loading, and
   stability.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the authors address the problem of resolving angular

   First, the frequency scanning antenna signal model is derived and then
   the necessary compensation methods to overcome antenna pattern
   variations with frequency during the scan in FSAs are presented. Two
   direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation algorithms, the minimum variance
   beamforming and the maximum-likelihood estimation are applied on the
   signal model. Simulation results show that both methods can separate
   targets with angular separations smaller than a beamwidth by selecting
   correct parameters. The performance of the two DOA estimation methods
   with respect to different system parameters are investigated based on
   the signal model through Monte Carlo simulations and compared with the
   Cramer-Rao lower bound. In addition, an FSA antenna is presented in this
   work and simulations of the DOA estimation algorithms are performed
   using the measured antenna pattern of this antenna. The performance and
   limitations of target DOA estimation methods for the measured antenna

   By recording the topographic and coefficient of friction (COF) images,
   it is possible to retrace the history of the wear track in real time.
   This method allows one to distinguish between different stages of wear
   related to different mechanisms (running-in, abrasive wear, and surface
   fatigue). This new approach is illustrated for a SiO2 thin film

Abstract = {{Heterotrophic culture of algal cells is now known as an efficient avenue
   for lipid production. However, the mechanisms involved are not clearly
   understood, especially when feeding glucose concurrently to autotrophic
   culture condition. In this work, the time course dynamics of central
   carbon metabolites of Chlorella protothecoides was studied in
   autotrophic, heterotrophic and mixotrophic cultures to elucidate the
   effect of glucose on the cell metabolic reorganization. Results show
   that assimilated CO2 mainly goes to the synthesis of upstream
   carbohydrate-based metabolites under autotrophic condition, while
   supplementing glucose recalibrates the metabolism towards downstream
   metabolites and lipids, rather than carbohydrates accumulation. The
   analysis of the lipid class shows, under glucose supplementation, that
   cells accumulate neutral lipids as storage rather than as membrane polar
   lipids, while fatty acid composition changes from polyunsaturated to
   saturated and monosaturated, which shows improving the quality of
   biodiesel precursors. The metabolic flux rearrangement seemed being
   regulated by a high cell energetic state that was maintained by a
   glucose metabolism. A high initial ATP-to-ADP ratio was observed after
   adding glucose, suggesting cell energetics as a biomarker of a metabolic
   shift from starch to lipid accumulation. These findings thus bring novel
   data on the regulation of carbon flow in microalgal cells, and enhance
   our understanding of microalgae as a lipid production platform. (C) 2016

Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{21-57}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Hierarchies of semidefinite programs have been used to approximate or
   even solve polynomial programs. This approach rapidly becomes
   computationally expensive and is often tractable only for problems of
   small size. In this paper, we propose a dynamic inequality generation
   scheme to generate valid polynomial inequalities for general polynomial
   programs. When used iteratively, this scheme improves the bounds without
   incurring an exponential growth in the size of the relaxation. As a
   result, the proposed scheme is in principle scalable to large general
   polynomial programming problems. When all the variables of the problem
   are non-negative or when all the variables are binary, the general
   algorithm is specialized to a more efficient algorithm. In the case of
   binary polynomial programs, we show special cases for which the proposed
   scheme converges to the global optimal solution. We also present several
   examples illustrating the computational behavior of the scheme and
   provide comparisons with Lasserre's approach and, for the binary linear
   case, with the lift-and-project method of Balas, Ceria, and Cornu,jols.}},

Title = {{Characterization of ballasted flocs in water treatment using microscopy}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{119-127}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Ballasted flocculation is widely used in the water industry for drinking
   water, municipal wastewater, storm water and industrial water treatment.
   This gravity-based physicochemical separation process involves the
   injection of a ballasting agent, typically microsand, to increase the
   floc density and size. However, the physical characteristics of the
   final ballasted flocs are still ill-defined. A microscopic method was
   specifically developed to characterize floc 1) density, 2) size and 3)
   shape factor. Using this information, probability density functions
   (PDFs) of the floc settling velocity were calculated. The impacts of the
   mixing intensity, polymer dosage, microsand size and contact time during
   the floc maturation phase were assessed. No correlation was identified
   between the floc diameter, form and density PDFs. The floc equivalent
   diameter mainly controls the settling velocity (r = 0.94), with the floc
   density (r = 0.26) and shape factor (r = 0.25) having lower impacts. A
   velocity gradient of 165 s(-1) was optimal to maintain the microsand in
   suspension while simultaneously maximizing the floc diameter. An anionic
   high molecular weight polyacrylamide formed 1.5-fold larger aggregates
   compared with the starch based polymer tested, but both polymers
   produced flocs of similar density (relative density = 1.53 +/- 0.03).
   Generally, the floc mean settling velocity is a good predictor of the
   turbidity removal. An in-depth analysis of the floc characteristics
   indicates a correlation between the floc size and the largest microsand
   grain potentially embeddable in the floc structure. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Hydronic radiant floor heating and cooling can potentially reduce energy
   consumption in buildings. Numerous building performance simulation (BPS)
   tools contain models for predicting the heat transfer between
   embedded-tube radiant floor systems and building thermal zones. However,
   the accuracy, limitations, and methodologies of these models, and their
   implementations into BPS tools, have never been contrasted in the
   literature. This paper describes the approaches employed by TRNSYS,
   ESP-r, and EnergyPlus for modelling embedded-tube radiant floors. An
   inter-model comparison is then presented for test cases designed to
   explore model performance. The predictions from the three BPS tools are
   compared to each other as well as to predictions made with a transient
   stand-alone finite element analysis tool. Significant issues are
   identified with the embedded-tube radiant floor models in all three BPS

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{49}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Preoccupation for improving concrete infrastructure durability has
   become just as important as safety issues and concrete cracking plays a
   key role for durability. Despite various studies carried out in the last
   decade, very little information regarding the propagation of cracking
   under sustained loading and the physical mechanisms involved is
   available. In order to address this problem, an experimental study on
   the propagation of a macrocrack under sustained loading in steel fibre
   reinforced concrete (SFRC) beams was completed. This article describes
   the flexural creep tests carried out on 0.7 m long beams. The evolution
   of the deflection, the crack width and the crack propagation were
   measured until the specimens' failure. The results permit the assessment
   of the influence of initial CMOD and sustained load levels on crack
   propagation, damage evolution, and the mechanisms leading to the rupture
   of the beams. In addition, behaviour of beams in sealed and drying
   hydric conditions with an identical loading history are compared to
   determine the influence of hydric conditions. The results show that
   crack propagation governs the failure mechanisms of SFRC beams subjected
   to high sustained load levels.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the exact solution of the vehicle routing problem with
   time windows, where multiple trips are allowed for the vehicles. In
   contrast to previous works in the literature, we specifically consider
   the case in which it is mandatory to visit all customers and there is no
   limitation on duration. We develop two branch-and-price frameworks based
   on two set covering formulations: a traditional one where columns
   (variables) represent routes, that is, a sequence of consecutive trips,
   and a second one in which columns are single trips. One important
   difficulty related to the latter is the way mutual temporal exclusion of
   trips can be handled. It raises the issue of time discretization when
   solving the pricing problem. Our dynamic programming algorithm is based
   on concept of groups of labels and representative labels. We provide
   computational results on modified small-sized instances (25 customers)
   from Solomon's benchmarks in order to evaluate and compare the two
   methods. Results show that some difficult instances are out of reach for
   the first branch-and-price implementation, while they are consistently
   solved with the second. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Association of

Abstract = {{The vehicle routing problem with hard time windows and stochastic
   service times (VRPTW-ST) introduced by Errico et al. (2013) in the form
   of a chance-constrained model mainly differs from other vehicle routing
   problems with stochastic service or travel times considered in the
   literature by the presence of hard time windows. This makes the problem
   extremely challenging. In this paper, we model the VRPTW-ST as a
   two-stage stochastic program and define two recourse policies to recover
   operations feasibility when the first stage plan turns out to be
   infeasible. We formulate the VRPTW-ST as a set partitioning problem and
   solve it by exact branch-cut-and-price algorithms. Specifically, we
   developed efficient labeling algorithms by suitably choosing label
   components, determining extension functions, and developing lower and
   upper bounds on partial route reduced cost to be used in the column
   generation step. Results on benchmark data show that our methods are
   able to solve instances with up to 50 customers for both recourse
   policies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Association of European Operational

Abstract = {{Over the past several years, the Modified Quasichemical Model for
   short-range ordering has been used successfully to obtain a quantitative
   thermodynamic description of various multicomponent high temperature
   inorganic molten salt systems. In the present paper, it was applied to
   the (LiN(FSO2)(2) + KN(FSO2)(2) + CsN(FSO2)(2)) ternary system and the
   ({[}C(2)mim]Cl + AlCl3) binary system (where {[}C(2)mim]Cl refers to
   1-ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium chloride), which both involve some ionic
   liquid compounds. Those two systems were selected as prototypes since
   experimental data were available for them in the literature. The
   (LiN(FSO2)(2) + KN(FSO2)(2) CsN(FSO2)(2)) liquid displays relatively
   little short-range ordering, and the experimental ternary eutectic at T
   = 309 K or 312 K was satisfactorily reproduced by using solely the
   optimized binary parameters along with a standard symmetric
   interpolation method. The ({[}C(2)mim]Cl + AlCl3) liquid displays strong
   negative deviations from ideality, and two different compositions of
   maximum short-range ordering (near the {[}C(2)mim]AlCl4 and
   {[}C(2)mim]Al2Cl7 compositions) were introduced. All available
   experimental data (phase diagram, emf measurements, partial enthalpies
   of mixing) were satisfactorily reproduced by the model. The Volume-based
   Thermodynamics (VBT) from Glasser and Jenkins was used to assess the
   missing thermodynamic data for {[}C2mim]Cl, and it was also tested on
   several ionic liquid compounds of the methyl-imidazolium type.

Title = {{Quantification and minimization of uncertainty by geostatistical
   simulations during the characterization of contaminated sites: 3-D
   approach to a multi-element contamination}},
Journal = {{GEODERMA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{264}},
Pages = {{214-226}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{The remediation of contaminated sites is recognized as a means towards
   the sustainable development of an expanding urban space on the global
   scale. However, it is often hindered by financial and environmental
   risks caused by undetected contamination or unreliable site
   characterization. Uncertainty in site characterization studies is
   suspected to be a cause of this problem. Therefore, there is a need for
   formally defining and quantifying the uncertainty linked to estimates of
   the spatial distribution of contamination and the volume of contaminated
   soils at polluted sites. The objective of this study was to develop a
   geostatistical procedure for the 3-D analysis of a multi-element
   contamination in order to: 1) optimize the location and the number of
   sampling stations during a complementary sampling campaign, 2) estimate
   the volume of contaminated soil for a given data set and 3) quantify the
   uncertainty of this estimate. This procedure is innovative because it
   takes into account, by a transformation in pollution indices, the
   presence of a multi-element contamination and applies to a set of 3-D
   data. Furthermore, this procedure offers a formal framework that adapts
   the decisional bounds to the study site to help the decision-maker. The
   proposed procedure was applied to an urban site characterized by the
   presence of a strongly heterogeneous fill. From a subset initially
   constituted of 8 sampling stations, supplemental sampling stations were
   selected within a complementary data set and added one by one to the
   iterative geostatistical simulations. The completeness of the sampling
   plan was determined upon reaching stability in the relative differences
   of both global uncertainty and global variance between two successive
   steps of the optimization. According to the procedure presented, a
   sampling plan could be considered optimized and complete with 19
   sampling stations for this study site (comparatively to 38 sampling
   stations for the total set obtained by systematic sampling). For 19
   sampling stations, the global uncertainty was determined to be 20\%
   (comparatively to 16\% for the total set). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The physical and chemical properties of metal-catalyzed semiconductor
   nanowires are very sensitive to their composition and morphology, which
   are very sensitive to the behavior of the catalyst nanodroplet during
   growth. Herein, we identify and investigate the main atomic pathways and
   processes governing the metal mass transport and the associated
   variation in the nanodroplet size throughout the growth of
   metal-catalyzed silicon nanowires. This includes surface diffusion and
   catalyst trapping in addition to the shift in phase boundaries of the
   eutectic nanodroplet to count for surface effects, capillarity, and
   related nanoscale stresses. On the basis of thermodynamic and kinetic
   considerations, a theoretical framework is presented to elucidate these
   catalyst nanodroplet instabilities. Moreover, we also address the
   influence of these phenomena on the shape and impurity concentration in
   silicon nanowires. Modeling results along with experimental data
   demonstrate that the combined effects of the kinetically driven catalyst
   trapping and surface diffusion play the key role in tailoring the
   nanowire morphology and composition. The proposed model can be extended
   straightforwardly to describe the evolution of the morphology during the
   growth of any other system of metal-catalyzed semiconductor nanowires.}},

Abstract = {{Light-assisted manipulation of cells to control membrane activity or
   intracellular signaling has become a major avenue in life sciences.
   However, the ability to perform subcellular light stimulation to
   investigate localized signaling has been limited. Here, we introduce an
   all optical method for the stimulation and the monitoring of localized
   Ca2+ signaling in neurons that takes advantage of plasmonic excitation
   of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). We show with confocal microscopy that 800
   nm laser pulse application onto a neuron decorated with a few AuNPs
   triggers a transient increase in free Ca2+, measured optically with
   GCaMP6s. We show that action potentials, measured
   electrophysiologically, can be induced with this approach. We
   demonstrate activation of local Ca2+ transients and Ca2+ signaling via
   CaMKII in dendritic domains, by illuminating a single or few
   functionalized AuNPs specifically targeting genetically-modified
   neurons. This NP-Assisted Localized Optical Stimulation (NALOS) provides
   a new complement to light-dependent methods for controlling neuronal

Abstract = {{Electroarthrography (EAG) consists of recording electrical potentials on
   the knee surface that originate from streaming potentials within
   articular cartilage while the joint is undergoing compressive loading.
   The aim was to investigate how the contraction of specific leg muscles
   affects the contact force of the knee joint and, in turn, the EAG
   values.
   For six normal subjects, voluntary isometric muscle contractions were
   repeatedly conducted to activate four leg muscle groups while the
   subject was lying on his back. Two EAG signals were recorded on the
   medial and lateral sides of the knee, as well as four EMG signals
   (gastrocnemius, hamstring, quadriceps, tensor fascia latae), and the
   signal from a force plate fixed against the foot according to the
   direction of the force.
   The EAG and force signals were very well correlated: the median of the
   correlation coefficients between an EAG signal and the corresponding
   force signal during each loading cycle was 0.91, and 86\% of the
   correlation coefficients were statistically significant (p < 5\%).
   Isolated muscle contraction was possible for the gastrocnemius and
   hamstring, but not always for the quadriceps and tensor fascia latae.
   Using the clinical loading protocol which consists of a one-legged
   stance, the quadriceps and hamstring EMG5 showed minimal activity;
   loading cycles with increased EAG amplitude were associated with higher
   EMG activity from the gastrocnemius, which is involved in
   antero-posterior balance.
   These results document the role of the EAG as a ``sensor{''} of the knee
   contact force and contribute to the development of clinical loading
   protocols with improved reproducibility. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations in the context of
   single-phase mixing remain challenging notably due the presence of a
   complex rotating geometry within the domain. In this work, we develop a
   parallel semi-implicit immersed boundary method based on Open. FOAM,
   which is applicable to unstructured meshes. This method is first
   verified on academic test cases before it is applied to single phase
   mixing. It is then applied to baffled and unbaffled stirred tanks
   equipped with a pitched blade impeller. The results obtained are
   compared to experimental data and those predicted with the single
   rotating frame and sliding mesh techniques. The proposed method is found
   to be of comparable accuracy in predicting the flow patterns and the
   torque values while being straightforwardly applicable to complex
   systems with multiples impellers for which the swept volumes overlap.

Abstract = {{Fully turbulent fluid flows in a laboratory-scale stirred tank (ST)
   equipped with a radial flow impeller (Rushton turbine; RT) or an axial
   flow impeller (pitched blade turbine; PBT) were analyzed using the
   radioactive particle tracking (RPT) technique. The present study covered
   the Eulerian and Lagrangian descriptions of fluid motions. The RPT
   measurement of the turbulent flow field in a tank agitated by an RT was
   benchmarked with CFD simulations of RANS-based turbulence models and
   laser-based measurements. There was good agreement between all the
   methods for the measured and predicted 3D mean velocity profiles at all
   locations in the ST. The RPT technique was used to measure the turbulent
   flow field in a tank agitated by a PBT for the first time. The behavior
   of the wall jet was investigated. There was close agreement between our
   results and those of previous studies for both systems. Lagrangian
   mixing measurements showed that particle trajectories can be used to
   generate Poincare maps, which in turn can be used as a tool to visualize
   the 3D flow structure inside mixing systems. Two mixing indices, one
   based on the concept of stochastic independence and the other on the
   statistical concept of memory loss in mixing processes, were used to
   measure mixing times using RPT results. The present study showed that
   the RPT technique holds great promise for investigating turbulent flows
   and the mixing characteristics of STs, and for assessing the adequacy of
   numerical models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The generalized mixture rule (GMR) is used to provide a unified
   framework for describing Young's (E), shear (G) and bulk (K) moduli,
   Lame parameter (lambda), and P- and S-wave velocities (V-p and V-s) as a
   function of porosity in various isotropic materials such as metals,
   ceramics and rocks. The characteristic J values of the GMR for E, G, K
   and lambda of each material are systematically different and display
   consistent correlations with the Poisson's ratio of the nonporous
   material (nu(0)). For the materials dominated by corner-shaped pores,
   the fixed point at which the effective Poisson's ratio (nu) remains
   constant is at nu(0) = 0.2, and J(G) > J(E) > J(K) > J(lambda) and J(G)
   < J(E) < J(K) < J(lambda) for materials with nu(0) > 0.2 and nu(0) <
   0.2, respectively. J(V-s) > J(V-p) and J(V-s) < J(V-p) for the materials
   with nu(0) > 0.2 and nu(0) < 0.2, respectively. The effective nu
   increases, decreases and remains unchanged with increasing porosity for
   the materials with nu(0) < 0.2, nu(0) > 0.2 and nu(0) = 0.2,
   respectively. For natural rocks containing thin-disk-shaped pores
   parallel to mineral cleavages, grain boundaries and foliation, however,
   the nu fixed point decreases nonlinearly with decreasing pore aspect
   ratio (alpha: width/length). With increasing depth or pressure, cracks
   with smaller alpha values are progressively closed, making the nu fixed
   point rise and finally reach to the point at nu(0) = 0.2. (C) 2016

Title = {{Is the Relationship between Cortical and White Matter Pathologic Changes
   in Multiple Sclerosis Spatially Specific? A Multimodal 7-T and 3-T MR
   Imaging Study with Surface and Tract-based Analysis}},

Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate in vivo the spatial specificity of the
   interdependence between intracortical and white matter (WM) pathologic
   changes as function of cortical depth and distance from the cortex in
   multiple sclerosis (MS), and their independent contribution to physical
   and cognitive disability.
   Materials and Methods: This study was institutional review
   board-approved and participants gave written informed consent. In 34 MS
   patients and 17 age-matched control participants, 7-T quantitative T2{*}
   maps, 3-T T1-weighted anatomic images for cortical surface
   reconstruction, and 3-T diffusion tensor images (DTI) were obtained.
   Cortical quantitative T2{*} maps were sampled at 25\%, 50\%, 75\% depth
   from pial surface. Tracts of interest were reconstructed by using
   probabilistic tractography. The relationship between DTI metrics
   voxelwise of the tracts and cortical integrity in the projection cortex
   was tested by using multilinear regression models.
   Results: In MS, DTI abnormal findings along tracts correlated with
   quantitative T2{*} changes (suggestive of iron and myelin loss) at each
   depth of the cortical projection area (P < .01, corrected). This
   association, however, was not spatially specific because abnormal
   findings in WM tracts also related to cortical pathologic changes
   outside of the projection cortex of the tract (P < .001). Expanded
   Disability Status Scale pyramidal score was predicted by axial
   diffusivity along the corticospinal tract (beta = 4.6 x 10(3); P <
   .001), Symbol Digit Modalities Test score by radial diffusivity along
   the cingulum (beta = -4.3 x 10(4); P < .01), and T2{*} in the cingulum
   cortical projection at 25\% depth (beta = -1.7; P < .05).
   Conclusion: Intracortical and WM injury are concomitant pathologic
   processes in MS, which are not uniquely distributed according to a
   tract-cortex-specific pattern; their association may reflect a common
   stage-dependent mechanism. (C) RSNA, 2015}},

Title = {{Effects of Various Post-Weld Heat Treatments on Austenite and Carbide

Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Multipass welding procedures are common methods for 13Cr4Ni steels'
   fabrication and repairs. Compared to a single-pass weld procedure, the
   weldmicrostructure in a multipass weld is more heterogeneous due to the
   complex local thermal cycles imposed by adjacent weld passes.
   Furthermore, the final microstructure and mechanical properties of these
   steels are very sensitive to their thermal history which increases the
   microstructure heterogeneities. Thus, post-weld heat treatments are
   performed to reduce heterogeneities and produce a relatively homogenous
   weld. It has been found that the best option to improve mechanical
   properties of 13Cr4Ni steels is forming a ``room temperature stable
   austenite{''} phase by heat treatments. This study focuses on the
   effects of these post-weld heat treatments on the austenite phase and
   carbide formations and the related evolutions of microhardness
   distribution. The study shows that nanometer-size carbides form at
   martensite lath interfaces and sub-block boundaries, and then at higher
   temperatures austenite lamellae appear at these locations. Results also
   show that the highest percentage of stable austenite achievable by a
   single-stage tempering was obtained at 610 degrees C. When the heat
   treatment temperature is lower than 610 degrees C, longer holding time
   produces softer steel while longer heat treatments at temperatures
   higher than 610 degrees C,produces harder steel. Still, double-stage
   heat treatments are more effective and produce the highest percentage of
   austenite and the lowest hardness of all heat treatments.}},

Abstract = {{Image processing and computer vision applications are usually complex in
   terms of the large amount of processed data and high computation loads.
   To cope with this, optimization techniques and high-performance hardware
   platforms are required. Since these applications present many
   opportunities for parallelism, heterogeneous parallel platforms (HPPs)
   are an interesting choice, offering a good balance between high
   computation capabilities and flexibility to handle a large spectrum of
   application features. Applications such as image filtering and edge
   detection make extensive use of finite difference method to solve
   partial derivative equations, which computational pattern is called
   stencil computation. Stencil computations are known as memory-bound, so
   that reducing high-latency memory access becomes the biggest challenge
   to reach high performance. In this paper, we present our methodology as
   a basis of a performance tuning framework to optimize the implementation
   of multiple stencil computations on HPPs. Results show that our approach
   outperforms SDK-based methodologies, improving performance. Moreover,
   using the proposed approach, the developer has the ability of
   investigating efficiently the performance of the stencil computations
   before implementing actual code on the target platforms.}},

Abstract = {{Topology optimization has been successfully used in several case studies
   in aerospace and automotive industries to generate innovative design
   concepts that lead to weight savings. This motivates the exploration of
   this new approach for the design of an aircraft flat pressure bulkhead.
   However, no studies were conducted on this type of structure. Therefore,
   this paper presents and discusses the challenges associated with the
   design of flat pressurized plate using topology optimization ( SIMP (
   Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization) method). A simply supported
   rectangular plate is used as the design case and a typical layout is
   defined as a comparison basis. The mass of the interpreted design
   concepts are obtained with a simplified sizing approach taking into
   consideration stress and displacement constraints. Results show that the
   topology layout is not unique as is sensitive to optimization
   parameters. Moreover, the interpretation of the layout is challenging as
   they are driven by complex interactions. Finally, the performance of the
   topology design concept is at most comparable with the typical layout
   and no significant improvement is obtained. The study highlights the
   importance of performing an extensive topology study in order to better
   understand the behavior of the design before creating a concept. An
   improved topology design process is finally proposed in order to provide
   guidance to industrial designers.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation of mass and energy are essential to physical accounting,
   just as price and market balances are essential to economic accounting.
   These principles guide data collection and inventory compilation in
   industrial ecology. The resulting balanced surveys, however, can rarely
   be used directly for life cycle assessment (LCA) or environmentally
   extended input-output (EEIO) analysis; some modeling is necessary to
   recast coproductions by multifunctional activities as monofunctional
   unit processes (a.k.a. Leontief production functions or technical
   recipes). This modeling is done with allocations in LCA and constructs
   in input-output. In this article, we ask how these models respect or
   perturb the balances of the original inventory. Which allocations or
   constructs, applied to what type of data set, have the potential to
   simultaneously respect its multiple physical, financial, and market
   balances? Our analysis builds upon the recent harmonization of
   allocations and constructs and the ongoing development of multilayered
   supply and use inventory tables. We derive the necessary and sufficient
   conditions for balanced models, investigate the role of data
   aggregation, and clarify these models' relation to system expansion. We
   find that none of the modeling families in LCA and EEIO are balanced in
   general, but special data characteristics can allow for the respect of
   multiple balances. An analysis of these special cases allows for clear
   guidance for data compilation and methods integration.}},

Title = {{Performance of a Catalytic Gas-Solid Fluidized Bed Reactor in the

Abstract = {{The influence of interparticle forces (IPFs) on the hydrodynamics of a
   gas-solid fluidized bed was experimentally investigated with the help of
   a polymer coating approach. The results showed that the presence of IPFs
   in the bed can considerably change the hydrodynamic parameters. The
   tendency of the fluidizing gas passing through the bed in the emulsion
   phase increased with IPFs in the bubbling regime. The performance of a
   fluidized bed reactor was then studied through simulation of a reactive
   catalytic system using three different hydrodynamic models: (a) a simple
   two-phase flow model, (b) a dynamic two-phase flow model, and (c) a
   dynamic two-phase flow model, integrating the effects of superficial gas
   velocity and IPFs. The simple two-phase flow model was found to
   underestimate the reactor performance for catalytic reaction most likely
   due to the oversimplified assumptions involved in this model. Also, the
   simulation results showed that modification of the bed hydrodynamics due
   to IPFs resulted in a better performance for a bubbling fluidized bed
   reactor. This suggests that the hydrodynamic models should take into
   account the effects of superficial gas velocity and variation in the
   ratio of the magnitude of IPFs/hydrodynamic forces, due to any
   operational reason, to yield a more reliable evaluation of the
   performance of the fluidized bed reactor.}},

Title = {{A Hybrid Iterated Local Search Algorithm for the Global Planning Problem
   of Survivable 4G Wireless Networks}},

Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a hybrid iterated local search (ILS)
   heuristic, named GPP4G-ILS, to solve the global planning problem of
   survivable wireless networks. The planning problem of wireless networks
   is to determine a set of sites among potential sites to install the
   various network devices in order to cover a given geographical area. It
   should also make the connections between the devices in accordance with
   well-defined constraints. The global planning consists in solving this
   problem without dividing it into several subproblems. The objective is
   to minimize the cost of the network while maximizing its survivability.
   The GPP4G-ILS algorithm is a new form of hybridization between the ILS
   algorithm and the integer linear programing (ILP) method. We propose a
   configuration that allows to reuse a previously developed ILP algorithm
   by integrating it in the ILS algorithm. This allows to benefit from the
   advantages of both methods. The ILS algorithm is used to effectively
   explore the search space, while the ILP algorithm is used to intensify
   the solutions obtained. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated
   using an exact method that generates optimal solutions for small
   instances. For larger instances, lower bounds have been calculated using
   a relaxation of the problem. The results show that the proposed
   algorithm is able to reach solutions that are, on average, within 0.06\%
   of the optimal solutions and 2.43\% from the lower bounds for the
   instances that cannot be solved optimally, within a reduced computation
   time.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is dedicated to the development of a thermal monitoring
   system for microelectronics based on the attentive vision approach as
   applied to image sequence analysis using an infrared camera. The
   attentive vision method implements multiscale image sequence analysis by
   a spatiotemporal attention operator to detect feature points, which are
   located inside potential thermal stress regions. The attention operator
   is a linear aggregation of temporal change and spatial saliency filters.
   The monitoring process is organized in two hierarchical phases: 1)
   peripheral and 2) focal. The focal monitoring is mostly carried out
   through the tracking of stress-relevant feature-point areas and analysis
   of their spatiotemporal descriptors. The thermal monitoring experiments
   conducted with wafer-scale integrated circuits have confirmed the
   reliability of the proposed approach and showed its high potential in
   image sequence analysis for monitoring purposes.}},

   interference channels (from secondary transmitters to primary receivers)
   at the secondary nodes, we investigate the problem of secondary
   achievable rate maximization under a constraint on the interference
   caused at the primary receivers. Different scenarios are defined based
   on the accuracy of estimating the interference channels at the primary
   receivers and the number of feedback quantization bits. For each
   scenario, we derive expressions for both the secondary achievable rate
   and the primary interference probability. Then, we investigate the
   associated power allocation problem and provide a sub-optimal solution.
   Finally, analytical and simulation results illustrate the efficiency of
   the provided solution in terms of secondary achievable rate and primary

Title = {{Modulation of MAPK signalling by immobilized adhesive peptides: Effect
   on stem cell response to BMP-9-derived peptides}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{31}},
Pages = {{241-251}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Biomimetic materials were developed to regulate stem cell behaviour. We
   have analyzed the influence of polycaprolactone (PCL) films,
   functionalized with adhesive peptides derived from fibronectin (pFibro)
   or bone sialoprotein (pBSP), on the response of murine multipotent
   C3H10T1/2 cells to bone morphogenetic protein-9 (BMP-9) and its derived
   peptides (pBMP-9 and SpBMP-9). PCL-pFibro promoted better cell
   cytoskeleton organization and faster focal adhesion kinase activation
   than did PCL-pBSP. PCL-pFibro also promoted MAPK signalling to improve
   the cell response to BMP-9 by inactivating ERK1/2 and stimulating p38
   and JNK. BMP-9, pBMP-9 and SpBMP-9 induced greater phosphorylation of
   Smad1/5/8 in cells attached to PCL-pFibro than in cells on PCL-pBSP.
   These phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 were translocated to the nucleus. BMP-9
   and its derived peptides restored the phosphorylation of JNK in cells on
   PCL-pBSP, but it remained less phosphorylated than in cells on
   PCL-pFibro stimulated with pBMP-9 and SpBMP-9. Cells attached to
   PCL-pFibro contained more Runx2, essential for stem cell commitment to
   become osteoblasts, than did cells on PCL-pBSP when incubated with BMP-9
   and its derived peptides. Runx2 was no longer detected when the cells
   were pre-treated with JNK inhibitor. Therefore pFibro plus BMP-9 and its
   derived peptides may be a promising strategy to develop biomimetic
   materials.
   Statement of significance
   Biomaterials functionalized with adhesive peptides to favour bone repair
   have generated a great interest over the past decade. However, the
   effect of these materials on the ability of cells to respond to growth
   factors remains poorly known. One major growth factor subfamily involved
   in bone formation is the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). However,
   these BMPs are expensive. We therefore developed less costly derived
   molecules. We showed how adhesive peptides derived from bone matrix
   proteins grafted onto polymer films affect the intracellular signalling
   and thus the ability of stem cells to be activated by BMP and its
   derived molecules. We have therefore identified a combination of
   bioactive polymers and BMP molecules that direct the stem cells towards
   bone forming cells. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{One- (1-D) and two-dimensional (2-D) beamforming is presented for a
   planar dipole antenna operating at millimeter-wave bands. 1-D
   beamforming was achieved by using mu (mu) -near-zero (MNZ) metamaterial
   slabs that were integrated in the dipole antenna, where each slab was
   loaded with an array of low refractive-index unit-cells. The resulting
   radiated beam can be scanned by 35 degrees due to the phase shift in the
   beam introduced by its interaction with the metamaterial slabs. In
   addition, the proposed antenna configuration provides gain improvement
   of 8 dB as the slabs effectively increase the aperture size of the
   antenna. An array of MNZ inclusions in the E-plane of a double dipole
   antenna is shown to provide scanning from -35 degrees to + 35 degrees
   with respect to the end-fire direction over 57-64 GHz. 2-D beam-scanning
   was realized by increasing the number of MNZ unit-cells in the elevation
   plane of double dipole antenna. Loading the slabs in front of the double
   dipole antenna with 10 x 7 array of MNZ unit-cells is shown to provide a
   beam deflection of 35 degrees in both the azimuth and elevation planes.}},

Abstract = {{Fusionless implants are used to correct pediatric progressive spinal
   deformities, most of them spanning the intervertebral disc. This study
   aimed at investigating the effects of in vivo static versus dynamic
   compression application and removal on discs of growing rats. A
   microloading device applied compression. 48 immature rats (28 d.o.) were
   divided into two groups (43d, 53d). Each group included four subgroups:
   control (no surgery), sham (device installed without loading), static
   (0.2MPa) and dynamic compressions (0.2MPa +/- 30\% with 0.1Hz). In 43d
   subgroups, compression was applied for 15 days. In 53d subgroups,
   compression was followed by 10 days without loading. Disc heights,
   nucleus/annulus volumetric proportions and nucleus proteoglycan contents
   were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey comparisons
   (p<0.05). Disc heights of 43d and 53d static and dynamic loading rats
   were lower than shams (p<0.05). Volumetric proportions remained similar.
   At 43d, nucleus proteoglycan contents increased in both static and
   dynamic loading rats. However, at 53d, static loading rats had lower
   proteoglycan content than dynamic loading rats (p<0.05). Disc structure
   is altered following static compression removal, but nucleus
   proteoglycan content remaining elevated in dynamic group. Dynamic
   fusionless implants would better preserve disc integrity. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{It addition to its high evaporation field, diamond is also known for its
   limited photoabsorption, strong covalent bonding, and wide bandgap.
   These characteristics have been thought for long to also complicate the
   field evaporation of diamond and make its control hardly achievable on
   the atomistic-level. Herein, we demonstrate that the unique behavior of
   nanoscale diamond and its interaction with pulsed laser lead to a
   controlled field evaporation thus enabling three-dimensional
   atom-by-atom mapping of diamond C-12/C-13 homojunctions. We also show
   that one key element in this process is to operate the pulsed laser at
   high energy without letting the dc bias increase out of bounds for
   diamond nanotip to withstand. Herein, the role of the dc bias in
   evaporation of diamond is essentially to generate free charge carriers
   within the nanotip, via impact ionization. The mobile free charges
   screen the internal electric field, eventually creating a hole rich
   surface where the pulsed laser is effectively absorbed leading to an
   increase in the nanotip surface temperature. The effect of this
   temperature on the uncertainty in the time-of-flight of an ion, the
   diffusion of atoms on the surface of the nanotip, is also discussed. In
   addition to paving the way toward a precise manipulation of isotopes in
   diamond-based nanoscale and quantum structures, this result also,
   elucidates some of the basic properties of dielectric nanostructures
   under high electric field.}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigates the impact of thermophoresis on soot
   capture in the clean cordierite porous wall of a diesel particulate
   filter (DPF). A three-step numerical model was developed, consisting of:
   (1) numerically reconstructing a representative volume of the cordierite
   porous wall, (2) computing gas flow through the porous wall using the
   lattice Boltzmann method, and (3) predicting of the DPF capture
   efficiency based on the time-dependent solution of a modified Langevin
   equation that takes thermophoresis into account. The validity of the
   approach was verified by carefully comparing the permeability
   predictions of a reconstructed cordierite porous wall to data from the
   literature. The impact of the magnitude and orientation of the
   thermophoretic force on the capture of soot particles of various sizes
   under different flow conditions was investigated. The thermophoretic
   force applied in or against the flow direction significantly affected
   the particle capture for the highest particle sizes and flow velocity
   investigated. Our results suggested that thermophoresis can potentially
   affect soot deposition uniformity in DPFs. Since the thermophoretic
   force mainly impacted soot capture efficiency in the presence of
   particle and flow inertia, a dimensionless criterion defined as the
   product of Stokes and Reynolds numbers is proposed to predict the onset
   of what can be called thermophoresis-enhanced inertial impaction. While
   similar results have been reported by others using simple flow
   geometries, this is the first time, to our knowledge, that this
   phenomenon is reported for a complex cordierite porous wall.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an on-wafer millimeter-wave circuit's
   characterization build on thin ceramic substrate having a high relative
   permittivity. An RF short circuit, designed with a quarter-wavelength
   radial stub, is used in load design and launch transition. To improve
   the design accuracy of electromagnetic (EM) tools, the dielectric
   constant of the ceramic substrate is extracted using measurements of
   several pairs of microstrip lines combined with EM simulations. The
   largest deviation obtained, compared with the mean value over the
   frequency band, is less than 1\%. Thus, a new six-port circuit is
   designed and characterized using a millimeter-wave probe station. A
   comparison between the measurement and simulation results, using
   extracted manufacturer-recommended relative permittivity, is conducted.
   The six-port qi points' location is close to the simulated and
   theoretical ones over the frequency band of interest. As demonstrated in
   this paper, the substrate permittivity extraction has improved the
   design accuracy of the millimeter-wave circuits. Excellent performance
   of this circuit in terms of matching, isolation, and amplitude and phase
   balance is obtained.}},

Abstract = {{This article discusses the variability of the mechanical properties
   (static stiffness, dynamic stiffness, and loss factor) observed in
   engine mounts used to isolate vibration caused by the engine in
   recreation utility vehicles. To avoid passenger's discomfort during
   engine operation, it is important that the isolation provided by each
   passive vibration isolator be constant. Transmitted forces should also
   be minimized to prevent excessive structural stresses in the vehicle.
   Quantifying how human and machine molding parameters affect the
   performance of the final product is fundamental. The isolators studied
   in this article are produced through manual cycles of an injection
   molding process. This work provides a better understanding of the
   discrepancies on mechanical properties occurring during the industrial
   process. Curing temperature (T) and curing time (D) were found to be the
   significant machine parameters. Response surface methodology shows a
   nonuniform distribution of the solutions across the whole experimental
   space. A linear model of the output variables appears to be sufficient
   to achieve an optimization since linear coefficients are prevalent over
   quadratic or interaction coefficients. A proposed empirical model
   enables the determination of a set of curing parameters corresponding to
   specific required properties. The model also shows that, for a
   polychloroprene rubber mix, the variability of the mechanical properties
   can be reduced by increasing the curing parameters (T and D) used during
   current molding procedures. Finally, the numerical results helped
   getting a better understanding of how manufacturing parameters can
   influence the optimization process of elastomeric product properties.
   Improved production parameters and control standards can be established
   from this case study.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of perturbation method in nonlinear analyses of plates
   subjected to mechanical, thermal, and thermo-mechanical loadings is
   investigated. To this end, cylindrical bending of FG plates with clamped
   and simply-supported edges is considered. The governing equations of
   Mindlin's first-order shear deformation theory with von Karman's
   geometric nonlinearity are solved using one- and two-parameter
   perturbation methods and the results are compared with the results of an
   analytical solution. The material properties are assumed to vary
   continuously through the thickness of the plate according to a power-law
   distribution of the volume fraction of the constituents. It is shown
   that the accuracy of any-order expansion in perturbation method depends
   not only on the perturbation parameter, but also on the location chosen
   for the perturbation parameter and, in general, the solution becomes
   more accurate when the perturbation parameter is specified at the
   location where its corresponding response quantity is a maximum. Under
   thermal loading the possibility of using different parameters as the
   perturbation parameter for various boundary conditions is investigated.
   It is observed that, instead of a one-parameter perturbation method, a
   two-parameter perturbation method must be used in the thermal analysis
   of FG plates. Also, buckling and post-buckling behavior of FG plates in
   cylindrical bending is investigated. It is shown that under thermal
   loading, a bifurcation-type buckling occurs in clamped FG plates. In
   addition, a snap-through buckling may occur in simply-supported FG
   plates under thermo-mechanical loading. (C) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH

Abstract = {{A de novo heterodimeric coiled-coil system formed by the association of
   two synthetic peptides, the Ecoil and Kcoil, has been previously
   designed and proven to be an excellent and versatile tool for various
   biotechnology applications. However, based on the challenges encountered
   during its chemical synthesis, the Kcoil peptide has been designated as
   a ``difficult peptide{''}. In this study, we explore the expression of
   the Kcoil peptide by a bacterial system as well as its subsequent
   purification. The maximum expression level was observed when the peptide
   was fused to thioredoxin and the optimized purification process
   consisted of three chromatographic steps: immobilized-metal affinity
   chromatography followed by cation-exchange chromatography and, finally,
   a reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. This entire
   process led to a final volumetric production yield of 1.5 mg of pure
   Kcoil peptide per liter of bacterial culture, which represents a
   significant step towards the cost-effective production and application
   of coiled-coil motifs. Our results thus demonstrate for the first time
   that bacterial production is a viable alternative to the chemical
   synthesis of de novo designed coil peptides.}},

Abstract = {{This research project investigated the sodium hypochlorite (NaClO)
   oxidation of aliphatic petroleum contaminants (C10-C50) in a calcareous
   soil (average 5473 ppm C10-C50, 15 wt\% Ca), which had been excavated
   from a contaminated industrial site. The decontamination objective was
   to lower the C10-C50 concentration to 700 ppm. CO2 acidity was used in
   the project to boost the NaClO oxidation yield and seems to have played
   a role in desorbing the natural organic matter. The experimental
   conditions were a 2- to 16-h reaction time, at room temperature, with a
   1 to 12.5 wt\% NaClO oxidative solution and a fixed 2:1 solution-to-soil
   ratio. With a 3 wt\% NaClO solution and with a CO2 overhead, the NaClO
   dosage requirement was maintained below 60 g NaClO/g of oxidized C10-C50
   over the entire decontamination range. The strong chlorine smell
   remaining after the reaction was completed suggests that part of the
   NaClO requirement can be recycled. Except traces of chloroform, there
   were no regulation-listed organochloride contaminants detected on either
   the treated soil samples or leachates and the total count of chlorinated
   compounds in treated soil samples was below the detection limit of 250
   mg/kg. The NaClO oxidation mechanism on aliphatic substrates might be
   triggered by transition metals, such as manganese, but no attempt has
   been made to investigate the oxidation mechanism. Further investigations
   would include a constant-fed NaClO system and other techniques to lower
   the required NaClO dosage. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mining of hard rock ore deposits produces large amounts of tailings. The
   safe disposal and management of these tailings require an extensive
   characterization that should include their drying and desaturation
   behaviour. Desiccation tests have been performed to characterize the
   shrinkage response of low plasticity tailings having an initially loose
   state. The testing procedure developed for this purpose is briefly
   described here. The main shrinkage tests results are then presented. The
   experimental data are compared with those obtained from water retention
   tests performed in a pressure plate with volume change measurements.
   These two types of results are combined to define unsaturated (drying
   and shrinkage) relationships in six complementary planes that include
   the volumetric shrinkage curve and the water retention curve. Specific
   material characteristics are then determined, including the shrinkage
   limit w (S), final void ratio e (f), and air entry value psi (a).
   Additional tests were also performed to define critical parameters at
   the initiation of cracking in terms of suction psi, water content w, and
   degree of saturation S (r). The original results presented here indicate
   that the onset of desaturation is closely linked with the end of
   volumetric straining and with crack initiation. Results also show that
   the shrinkage limit w (S) is a function of the specimen initial water
   content w (0). Other related characteristics are also presented and
   discussed.}},

Title = {{Using patient-specific hemodynamic response function in epileptic spike
   analysis of human epilepsy: a study based on EEG-fNIRS}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{126}},
Pages = {{239-255}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can be combined with
   electroencephalography (EEG) to continuously monitor the hemodynamic
   signal evoked by epileptic events such as seizures or interictal
   epileptiform discharges (IEDs, aka spikes). As estimation methods
   assuming a canonical shape of the hemodynamic response function (HRF)
   might not be optimal, we sought to model patient-specific HRF (sHRF)
   with a simple deconvolution approach for IED-related analysis with
   EEG-fNIRS data. Furthermore, a quadratic term was added to the model to
   account for the nonlinearity in the response when IEDs are frequent.
   Prior to analyzing clinical data, simulations were carried out to show
   that the HRF was estimable by the proposed deconvolution methods under
   proper conditions. EEG-fNIRS data of five patients with refractory focal
   epilepsy were selected due to the presence of frequent clear IEDs and
   their unambiguous focus localization. For each patient, both the linear
   sHRF and the nonlinear sHRF were estimated at each channel. Variability
   of the estimated sHRFs was seen across brain regions and different
   patients. Compared with the SPM8 canonical HRF (cHRF), including these
   sHRFs in the general linear model (GLM) analysis led to hemoglobin
   activations with higher statistical scores as well as larger spatial
   extents on all five patients. In particular, for patients with frequent
   IEDs, nonlinear sHRFs were seen to provide higher sensitivity in
   activation detection than linear sHRFs. These observations support using
   sHRFs in the analysis of IEDs with EEG-fNIRS data. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background: Cerium oxide (CeO2) and Ce-doped nanostructured materials
   (NMs) are being seen as innovative therapeutic tools due to their
   exceptional antioxidant effects; nevertheless their bio-applications are
   still in their infancy.
   Methods: TiO2, Ce-TiO2 and CeO2-TiO2 NMs were synthesized by a bottom-up
   microemulsion-mediated strategy and calcined during 7 h at 650 degrees C
   under air flux. The samples were compared to elucidate the
   physicochemical characteristics that determine cellular uptake, toxicity
   and the influence of redox balance between the Ce3+/Ce4+ on the
   cytoprotective role against an exogenous ROS source: H2O2. Fibroblasts
   were selected as a cell model because of their participation in wound
   healing and fibrotic diseases.
   Results: Ce-TiO2 NM obtained via sol-gel reaction chemistry of metallic
   organic precursors exerts a real cytoprotective effect against H2O2 over
   fibroblast proliferation, while CeO2 pre-formed nanoparticles
   incorporated to TiO2 crystalline matrix lead to a harmful CeO2-TiO2
   material. TiO2 was processed by the same pathways as Ce-TiO2 and
   CeO2-TiO2 NM but did not elicit any adverse or protective influence
   compared to controls.
   Conclusions: It was found that the Ce atoms source and its concentration
   have a clear effect on material's physicochemical properties and its
   subsequent influence in the cellular response. It can induce a range of
   biological reactions that vary from cytotoxic to cytoprotective.
   General significance: Even though there are still some unresolved issues
   and challenges, the unique physical and chemical properties of Ce-based
   NMs are fascinating and versatile resources for different biomedical
   applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hub location problems appear at the core of strategic planning for many
   transportation and logistics problems. This class of optimization
   problems has received a wide gamut of research attention during the last
   few decades. However, the associated mathematical formulations are
   mainly developed with deterministic parameters to avoid the complexities
   and computational difficulties. In this paper, we put forward an
   extension to the uncapacitated single allocation p-hub median problem
   under uncertainty in which demands and travel times are stochastic. A
   robust optimization approach is used to deal with uncertainty in
   parameters and design a robust hub-and-spoke network. The developed
   model minimizes the total expected transportation costs, while bounding
   the relative regret in each scenario. To efficiently solve the model, a
   two-stage approach is investigated to design two hybrid heuristics. We
   firstly apply a meta-heuristic (i.e., variable neighborhood search (VNS)
   or particle swarm optimization (PSO)) to find the best combination for
   the hubs location. Then, by fixing the hubs location, the original model
   easily decomposes by scenario for which an efficient tabu search (TS) is
   designed. Encouraging results on a wide-range of test problems are
   reported.}},

Abstract = {{A complete literature review, critical evaluation, and thermodynamic
   modeling of the phase diagrams and thermodynamic properties of phases in
   the Al-Fe-O system at 1 atm total pressure are presented. Optimized
   model equations for the thermodynamic properties of all phases are
   obtained, which reproduce all available thermodynamic and
   phase-equilibrium data within experimental error limits from 298.15 K
   (25 A degrees C) to above the liquidus temperatures at all compositions
   and oxygen partial pressures from metal saturation to 1 atm. The complex
   phase relationships in the system have been elucidated, and
   discrepancies among the data have been resolved. The database of the
   model parameters can be used along with software for Gibbs-energy
   minimization in order to calculate all thermodynamic properties and any
   type of phase diagram section. The modified quasichemical model was used
   for the liquid oxide phase. A sublattice model, based upon the Compound
   Energy Formalism, was developed for spinel, which expands from
   magnetite, Fe3O4, to hercynite, FeAl2O4. The distribution of cations
   between octahedral and tetrahedral sites and oxygen nonstoichiometry in
   spinel are taken into account. The model for metallic liquid assumes
   random mixing of associates: Fe, Al, O, AlO, and Al2O. It describes well
   the minimum that is observed on the solubility of oxygen in liquid iron
   as a function of the Al content. The solid solution between hematite and
   corundum exhibiting a miscibility gap, as well as a small solubility of
   Al2O3 in wustite are quantitatively described by a simple Bragg-Williams
   model.}},

Abstract = {{Several recent studies demonstrated significant charge storage in
   electrochemical biofilms. Aiming to evaluate the impact of charge
   storage on microbial fuel cell (MFC) performance, this work presents a
   combined bioelectrochemical-electrical (CBE) model of an MFC. In
   addition to charge storage, the CBE model is able to describe fast (ms)
   and slow (days) nonlinear dynamics of MFCs by merging mass and electron
   balances with equations describing an equivalent electrical circuit.
   Parameter estimation was performed using results of MFC operation with
   intermittent (pulse-width modulated) connection of the external
   resistance. The model was used to compare different methods of selecting
   external resistance during MFC operation under varying operating
   conditions. Owing to the relatively simple structure and fast numerical
   solution of the model, its application for both reactor design and
   real-time model-based process control applications are envisioned.}},

Abstract = {{We here report the production of four biotinylated Fc gamma receptor (Fc
   gamma R) ectodomains and their subsequent stable capture on
   streptavidin-biosensor surfaces. For receptor biotinylation, we first
   describe an in-cell protocol based on the co-transfection of two
   plasmids corresponding to one of the Fc gamma R ectodomains and the BirA
   enzyme in mammalian cells. This strategy is compared with a standard
   sequential in vitro enzymatic biotinylation with respect to
   biotinylation level and yield. Biotinylated Fc gamma R ectodomains that
   have been prepared with both strategies are then compared by analytical
   ultracentrifugation and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analyses.
   Overall, we demonstrate that in-cell biotinylation is an interesting
   alternative to standard biotinylation protocol, as it requires less
   purification steps while yielding higher titers.
   Finally, biotin-tagged Fc gamma Rs produced with the in-cell approach
   are successfully applied to the development of SPR-based assays to
   evaluate the impact of the glycosylation pattern of monoclonal
   antibodies on their interaction with CD16a and CD64. In that endeavor,
   we unambiguously observe that highly galactosylated trastuzumab
   (TZM-gal), non-glycosylated trastuzumab (TZM-NG), and reference
   trastuzumab are characterized by different kinetic profiles upon binding
   to CD16a and CD64 that had been captured at the biosensor surface via
   their biotin tag. More precisely, while TZM-NG binding to CD16a was not
   detected, TZM-gal formed a more stable complex with CD16a than our
   reference TZM. In contrast, both glycosylated TZM bound to captured CD64
   in a stable and similar fashion, whereas the interaction of their
   non-glycosylated form with CD64 was characterized by a higher
   dissociation rate. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{39}},
Pages = {{48-63}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider a recently proposed model for portfolio
   selection, called Mean-Downside Risk-Skewness (MDRS) model. This
   modelling approach takes into account both the multidimensional nature
   of the portfolio selection problem and the requirements imposed by the
   investor. Concretely, it optimizes the expected return, the
   downside-risk and the skewness of a given portfolio, taking into account
   budget, bound and cardinality constraints. The quantification of the
   uncertain future return on a given portfolio is approximated by means of
   LR-fuzzy numbers, while the moments of its return are evaluated using
   possibility theory. The main purpose of this paper is to solve the MDRS
   portfolio selection model as a whole constrained three-objective
   optimization problem, what has not been done before, in order to analyse
   the efficient portfolios which optimize the three criteria
   simultaneously. For this aim, we propose new mutation, crossover and
   reparation operators for evolutionary multi-objective optimization,
   which have been specially designed for generating feasible solutions of
   the cardinality constrained MDRS problem. We incorporate the operators
   suggested into the evolutionary algorithms NSGAII, MOEA/D and GWASF-GA
   and we analyse their performances for a data set from the Spanish stock
   market. The potential of our operators is shown in comparison to other
   commonly used genetic operators and some conclusions are highlighted
   from the analysis of the trade-offs among the three criteria. (C) 2015

Journal = {{FUEL}},

Volume = {{165}},
Pages = {{166-172}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Secondary ilmenite is an inexpensive mineral that is a potential oxygen
   carrier for the chemical looping process. It has excellent mechanical
   stability, adequate heat capacity to transfer heat from the air reactor
   to the fuel reactor, and possesses a modest oxygen transfer capacity.
   Fresh and preoxidized ilmenite can transfer up to 1.7\% and 1.2\% oxygen
   on a mass basis, when reduced for 2 min with CO at 910 degrees C.
   Preoxidizing ilmenite reduces its tendency to agglomerate but it also
   reduced its reactivity towards CO. We characterized the kinetics of the
   reduction of preoxidized secondary ilmenite from South Africa with a
   mechanistic model. The model assumes CO reacts with surface oxygen
   atoms, and that bulk oxygen replenishes the surface oxygen. The model
   accounts for more than 90\% of the variance in the data. The activation
   energies of the surface reduction and reoxidation steps are 51 kJ
   mol(-1) and 89 kJ mol(-1), respectively. The surface site density
   decreases with the reduction cycles via the simple power law expression
   because sintering deactivates the catalyst. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Evaluation of contact forces-centers of the tibiofemoral joint in gait
   has crucial biomechanical and pathological consequences. It involves
   however difficulties and limitations in in vitro cadaver and in vivo
   imaging studies. The goal is to estimate total contact forces (CF) and
   location of contact centers (CC) on the medial and lateral plateaus
   using results computed by a validated finite element model simulating
   the stance phase of gait for normal as well as osteoarthritis,
   varus-valgus and posterior tibial slope altered subjects. Using
   foregoing contact results, six methods commonly used in the literature
   are also applied to estimate and compare locations of CC at 6 periods of
   stance phase (0\%, 5\%, 25\%, 50\%, 75\% and 100\%).
   TF joint contact forces are greater on the lateral plateau very early in
   stance and on the medial plateau thereafter during 25-100\% stance
   periods. Large excursions in the location of CC (> 17 mm), especially on
   the medial plateau in the mediolateral direction, are computed. Various
   reported models estimate quite different CCs with much greater
   variations (similar to 15 mm) in the mediolateral direction on both
   plateaus. Compared to our accurately computed CCs taken as the gold
   standard, the centroid of contact area algorithm yielded least
   differences (except in the mediolateral direction on the medial plateau
   at similar to 5 mm) whereas the contact point and weighted center of
   proximity algorithms resulted overall in greatest differences. Large
   movements in the location of CC should be considered when attempting to
   estimate TF compartmental contact forces in gait. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The combined effect of strontium and bismuth on the flake-to-fibrous
   transition associated with eutectic silicon in near-eutectic
   Al-11.7Si-1.8Cu-0.8Zn-0.6Fe-0.3Mg alloys, in both normal and interrupted
   solidification, on the macro, micro and nano-scale has been
   investigated. The results revealed that an interaction occurred between
   Sr and Bi at a certain threshold weight ratio of Sr/Bi, whereby the fine
   fibrous Si changed into coarse flake-like morphology. This interaction
   led to a dramatic change of both the nucleation and growth modes of
   eutectic Si. Interrupted quenching and electron back-scatter diffraction
   observations showed that fibrous Si nucleates independently between
   aluminium dendrites whereas flake Si nucleates epitaxially adjacent to
   the dendrites. TEM observations showed a decrease of twin density and
   increase of twin spacing associated with the fibrous-to-flake
   transition. Moreover, eutectic coherency point revealed a shorter time
   for the growth of eutectic grain in fibrous silicon. Formation of the
   pre-eutectic ternary compound of Bi2Mg2Sr is proposed to be responsible
   for the deactivation of Sr and consequently fibrous-to-flake transition
   of silicon. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We consider an inventory routing problem (IRP) in the liquefied natural
   gas (LNG) supply chain, called the LNG-IRP. Here, an actor is
   responsible for the LNG production and inventory management at the
   liquefaction plants, the routing and scheduling of a heterogeneous fleet
   of LNG ships, as well as the inventories and sales at the regasification
   terminals. Furthermore, all ports have a limited number of berths
   available for loading and unloading. The LNG-IRP is more complicated
   than many other maritime inventory routing problems because a constant
   rate of the cargo evaporates in the tanks each day and is used as fuel
   during transportation. In addition, a variable number of tanks are
   unloaded at the regasification terminals. We introduce a new path flow
   formulation for this problem arising from a novel decomposition scheme
   based on parts of a ship schedule, called duties. A ship schedule for
   the entire planning horizon can be divided into duties consisting of a
   visit to a liquefaction plant, then one or two visits to a
   regasification terminal before ending in a liquefaction plant. The
   solution method suggested is based on a priori generation of duties, and
   the formulation is strengthened by valid inequalities. The same problem
   was previously solved by a branch-price-and-cut algorithm for a
   schedule-based formulation. Computational results show that the new
   formulation provides tighter bounds than the previous schedule-based
   formulation. Furthermore, on a set of 27 benchmark instances, the
   proposed algorithm clearly outperforms the previous branch-price-and-cut
   algorithm both with regard to computational time and the number of
   problems solved within a 10-h time limit.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a version of the classical traveling salesman
   problem with time-dependent service times. In our setting, the duration
   required to provide service to any customer is not fixed but defined as
   a function of the time at which service starts at that location. The
   objective is to minimize the total route duration, which consists of the
   total travel time plus the total service time. The proposed model can
   handle several types of service time functions, e.g., linear and
   quadratic functions. We describe basic properties for certain classes of
   service time functions, followed by the computation of valid lower and
   upper bounds. We apply several classes of subtour elimination
   constraints and measure their effect on the performance of our model.
   Numerical results obtained by implementing different linear and
   quadratic service time functions on several test instances are
   presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Association of European

Abstract = {{A robust multi-fidelity design optimization methodology has been
   developed to integrate advantages of high- and low-fidelity analyses,
   aiming to help designers reach more efficient turbine runners within
   reasonable computational time and cost. An inexpensive low-fidelity
   inviscid flow solver handles most of the computational burden by
   providing data to the optimizer by evaluating objective functions and
   constraint values in the low-fidelity phase. An open-source
   derivative-free optimizer, NOMAD, explores the search space, using the
   multi-objective mesh adaptive direct search optimization algorithm. A
   versatile filtering algorithm is in charge of connecting low- and
   high-fidelity phases by selecting among all feasible solutions a few
   promising solutions which are transferred to the high-fidelity phase. In
   the high-fidelity phase, a viscous flow solver is used outside the
   optimization loop to accurately evaluate filtered candidates.
   High-fidelity analyses results are used to recalibrate the low-fidelity
   optimization problem. The developed methodology has demonstrated its
   ability to efficiently redesign a Francis turbine blade for new
   operating conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recombinant yeast pyruvate carboxylase (PYC2) expression was previously
   shown to be an effective metabolic engineering strategy for reducing
   lactate formation in a number of relevant mammalian cell lines, but, in
   the case of CHO cells, did not consistently lead to significant
   improvement in terms of cell growth, product titer and energy metabolism
   efficiency. In the present study, we report on the establishment of a
   PYC2-expressing CHO cell line producing a monoclonal antibody and
   displaying a significantly altered lactate metabolism compared to its
   parental line. All clones exhibiting strong PYC2 expression were shown
   to experience a significant and systematic metabolic shift toward
   lactate consumption, as well as a prolonged exponential growth phase
   leading to an increased maximum cell concentration and volumetric
   product titer. Of salient interest, PYC2-expressing CHO cells were shown
   to maintain a highly efficient metabolism in fed-batch cultures, even
   when exposed to high glucose levels, thereby alleviating the need of
   controlling nutrient at low levels and the potential negative impact of
   such strategy on product glycosylation. In bioreactor operated in
   fed-batch mode, the higher maximum cell density achieved with the PYC2
   clone led to a net gain (20\%) in final volumetric productivity. (C)

   enhancements to the framework, including a derivation of closed-form

Title = {{Modeling an Augmented Lagrangian for Blackbox Constrained Optimization}},
Journal = {{TECHNOMETRICS}},

Volume = {{58}},

Abstract = {{Constrained blackbox optimization is a difficult problem, with most
   approaches coming from the mathematical programming literature. The
   statistical literature is sparse, especially in addressing problems with
   nontrivial constraints. This situation is unfortunate because
   statistical methods have many attractive properties: global scope,
   handling noisy objectives, sensitivity analysis, and so forth. To narrow
   that gap, we propose a combination of response surface modeling,
   expected improvement, and the augmented Lagrangian numerical
   optimization framework. This hybrid approach allows the statistical
   model to think globally and the augmented Lagrangian to act locally. We
   focus on problems where the constraints are the primary bottleneck,
   requiring expensive simulation to evaluate and substantial modeling
   effort to map out. In that context, our hybridization presents a simple
   yet effective solution that allows existing objective-oriented
   statistical approaches, like those based on Gaussian process surrogates
   and expected improvement heuristics, to be applied to the constrained
   setting with minor modification. This work is motivated by a
   challenging, real-data benchmark problem from hydrology where, even with
   a simple linear objective function, learning a nontrivial valid region
   complicates the search for a global minimum. Supplementary materials for
   this article are available online.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Aluminum powder is a significant component of many energetic
   formulations for rocket propellants and explosives due to its high
   combustion enthalpy on both a mass and volumetric basis. The combustion
   properties of these formulations can be enhanced further through the use
   of aluminum nanoparticles including shorter ignition delay, shorter
   burning time, and more complete combustion. High-energy ball milling was
   used as a method to produce aluminum-functionalized nanoparticles. This
   method is based on the reaction of the new metallic surface generated by
   grinding with an organic functionalized compound. In order to enhance
   the reactivity of aluminum powders coated by organic layers, we replaced
   the organic functionalized compound with an energetic polymer-glycidyl
   azide polymer (GAP). To achieve a desirable reactivity of GAP with
   aluminum particles, GAP plasticizer has been chemically modified by the
   partial reactions of azide groups on the polymer chain. The modified GAP
   (GAPm) was grafted onto the aluminum particles by the reactions of acid
   groups and aluminum in a simultaneous reaction milling. The aluminum
   particles coated with GAPm were characterized by the
   Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analysis technique and scanning
   electron microscopy. Thermal gravimetric and differential thermal
   analyses were also used to carry out a study on the reactivity of the
   coated powders. Several different formulations of these coated powders
   combined with a binder were produced to investigate the influence of
   energetic capping of nanoparticles on the heat of combustion of these
   novel solid fuels.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a semantic segmentation method for outdoor scenes
   captured by a surveillance camera. Our algorithm classifies each
   perceptually homogenous region as one of the predefined classes learned
   from a collection of manually labelled images. The proposed approach
   combines two different types of information. First, color segmentation
   is performed to divide the scene into perceptually similar regions.
   Then, the second step is based on SIFT keypoints and uses the bag of
   words representation of the regions for the classification. The
   prediction is done using a Naive Bayesian Network as a generative
   classifier. Compared to existing techniques, our method provides more
   compact representations of scene contents and the segmentation result is
   more consistent with human perception due to the combination of the
   color information with the image keypoints. The experiments conducted on
   a publicly available data set demonstrate the validity of the proposed
   method.}},

Abstract = {{Advertising fraud, particularly click fraud, is a growing concern for
   the online advertising industry. The use of click bots, malware that
   automatically clicks on ads to generate fraudulent traffic, has steadily
   increased over the last years. While the security industry has focused
   on detecting and removing malicious binaries associated with click bots,
   a better understanding of how fraudsters operate within the ad ecosystem
   is needed to be able to disrupt it efficiently.
   This paper provides a detailed dissection of the advertising fraud
   scheme employed by Boaxxe, a malware specializing in click fraud. By
   monitoring its activities during a 7-month longitudinal study, we were
   able to create of map of the actors involved in the ecosystem enabling
   this fraudulent activity. We then applied a Social Network Analysis
   (SNA) technique to identify the key actors of this ecosystem that could
   be effectively influenced in order to maximize disruption of click-fraud
   monetization. The results show that it would be possible to efficiently
   disrupt the ability of click-fraud traffic to enter the legitimate
   market by pressuring a limited number of these actors. We assert that
   this approach would produce better long term effects than the use of
   take downs as it renders the ecosystem unusable for monetization.}},

Abstract = {{The cost and complexity involved in the development of critical systems
   encourage the use of reliability assessment techniques as early in the
   design cycle as possible. Existing techniques often lack the capacity to
   perform a comprehensive and exhaustive analysis on complex redundant
   architectures, leading to less than optimal risk evaluation. This paper
   addresses these weaknesses by 1) proposing a new probabilistic modeling
   of Fault Tree gates and their composition as Markov Decision Processes;
   2) developing a new formal-based technique to perform an in-depth
   verification of the system's reliability. This technique makes use of
   the expressiveness of fault trees and the power of probabilistic model
   checking in order to investigate the best Triple Modular Redundancy
   partitioning and configuration of a system. The presented approach
   greatly improves the overall scalability with respect to other
   techniques, while also improving the accuracy of the results. For
   example, we can provide probabilistic failure rates for a chain of 100
   redundant components in little over one second.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient mapping of tasks onto heterogeneous multi-core systems is very
   challenging especially under hard timing constraints. Assigning tasks to
   processors is an NP-hard problem and solving it requires the use of
   meta-heuristics. Relevantly, genetic algorithms have already proven to
   be one of the most powerful and widely used stochastic tools to solve
   this problem. Conventional genetic algorithms were initially defined as
   a general evolutionary algorithm based on blind operators. It is
   commonly admitted that the use of these operators is quite poor for an
   efficient exploration. Likewise, since exhaustive exploration of the
   solution space is unrealistic, a potent option is often to guide the
   exploration process by hints, derived by problem structure. This guided
   exploration prioritizes fitter solutions to be part of next generations
   and avoids exploring unpromising configurations by transmitting a set of
   predefined criteria from parents to children. Consequently, genetic
   operators, such as crossover, must incorporate specific domain knowledge
   to intelligently guide the exploration of the solution space. In this
   paper, we illustrate and evaluate the impact of crossover operators and
   we propose a hybrid genetic algorithm based on a novel
   schedulability-guided operator that easily outperforms the classical
   operators by offering at least 21\% improvement in terms of ratio of
   certainly schedulable tasks.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer is replacing glass at an increasing rate in uses ranging from
   ophthalmic applications to electronic devices and displays. In the case
   of optical interference filters on plastic substrates such as
   antirefiective coatings, the performance of the device is limited by the
   coating-substrate compatibility; for example, thermal expansion
   coefficient of the substrate is about 100 times that of glass
   Significantly improved resistance to temperature and humidity variation
   and higher elastic recovery of organic-inorganic SiO2 and ZrO2 coatings
   compared to their inorganic counterparts are demonstrated.
   Organic-inorganic coatings prepared by ion beam -assisted chemical vapor
   deposition (IBACVD) show a higher thermal expansion (10(-5) K-1) close
   to that of polymer substrates (10(-4) K-1 for CR-39) as well as a
   relatively high hardness/elastic modulus (H/E) ratio (up to 0.16). Both
   individual organic-inorganic layers and complete antirefiective stacks
   exhibit a higher durability following accelerated environmental tests
   including exposure to high temperature/high humidity, ultraviolet (UV)

Abstract = {{In Canada, before asking Engineers Canada Accreditation Board (BCAPG)
   for engineering program accreditation or remain accredited, Engineers
   Canada should determine if it falls into the categories that they
   accredit, and that it meets all the requirements. One of the twelve
   qualities which engineering student must acquire is experimental
   investigation. This means it must be able to study complex problems by
   methods involving conducting experiments, analysing and interpreting
   data and synthesis of information to draw valid conclusions.
   The aim of this paper is to design an experimental setup for educational
   purposes for the characterization of two-stage compressor. Using this
   setup, students will validate the theory of compressors (intermediate
   pressure, maximum temperature in the compressor, performance, power).
   This bench uses several theoretical concepts covered in other courses.
   We also developed a grid to validate the investigation quality. Students
   will be observed on site to validate performing experiments.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the achievable rate and the average sum
   capacity of an underlay cognitive radio (CR) (also known as a secondary)
   system. We consider single user (SU) and multiple users (MU) secondary
   systems that deploy spread spectrum as the signaling technique which
   utilizes the whole available spectrum. The objective is to maximize the
   achievable rate and the average sum capacity of the SU and MU secondary
   systems, respectively, by allocating the optimum power to the secondary
   transmitter(s) (STs), such that the instantaneous (aggregate)
   interference power from STs is below a certain threshold at the primary
   receiver (PR), to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) of the primary
   system. Numerical and Monte-Carlo Simulation results show that the
   achievable rate of the SU system and the average sum capacity of the MU
   system can be enhanced significantly compared to other signaling
   techniques, because of the fact that in spread spectrum the signal's
   power is spread over a wider bandwidth, which gives the secondary system
   more freedom to allocate power to enhance the data rate.}},

Abstract = {{The use of energy harvesting wireless sensor network (EH-WSN) is a
   rising wireless communication technology with a wide range of
   applications such as environment monitoring. Maximizing the number of
   samples collected by the sink from sensors is a key approach in order to
   minimize uncertainties for those applications. The considered system in
   this paper consists of an uplink scenario with EH sensors communicating
   with a non EH sink, equipped with multiple antennas, receiving data
   forwarded by the sensors. Using a zero-forcing (ZF) receiver, the data
   collector (i.e., sink) selects the largest possible set of transmitting
   sensor nodes to maximize the received quantity of information, while
   satisfying their signal-to-noise ratio quality of service (QoS)
   constraints. This paper presents efficient and simple EH node selection
   algorithms in EH-WSNs in order to maximize the number of selected
   sensors. The problem is formulated as an integer non linear program that
   can be optimally solved using an exhaustive search. Due to the
   prohibitive complexity of such a brute force approach, two low
   complexity and efficient heuristic algorithms are proposed to perform
   node selection decisions. Simulation results show the performance of the
   proposed algorithms and illustrate their adaptability and efficiency in
   the energy harvesting context.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, software development projects produce a large number of
   software artifacts including source code, execution traces, end-user
   feedback, as well as informal documentation such as developers'
   discussions, change logs, Stack Overflow, and code reviews. Such data
   embeds rich and significant knowledge about software projects, their
   quality and services, as well as the dynamics of software development.
   Most often, this data is not organized, stored, and presented in a way
   that is immediately useful to software developers and project managers
   to support their decisions. To help developers and managers understand
   their projects, how they evolve, as well as support them during their
   decision making process, software analytics - use of analysis, data, and
   systematic reasoning for making decisions - has become an emerging field
   of modern data analysis. While results obtained from analytics-based
   solutions suggested so far are promising, there are still several
   challenges associated with the adoption of software analytics into
   software development processes, as well as the development and
   integration of analytics tools in practical settings. We therefore
   propose a tutorial on software analytics. The tutorial will start with
   an introduction of software analytics. Next, we will discuss the main
   challenges and opportunities associated with software analytics based on
   the examples from our own research. These examples will cover a range of
   topics leveraging software analytics. The topics include mobile apps
   quality, code review process and its quality, analytics for the software
   engineering Twitter space, as well as the use of analytics to solve
   scheduling problems in the cloud.}},

Abstract = {{This paper tackles the gain-scheduling control design issue when
   endogenous signals are selected as scheduling parameters. In this case,
   the gain-scheduled controller exhibits nonlinear dynamics, leading to

   hidden coupling terms in the synthesis process may induce performance
   degradation or even the destabilization of the closed-loop system The
   present paper aims at extending a previous work on the design of

Abstract = {{To estimate structural fatigue, vibrational response to realistic
   spectrum of excitations and associated equivalent damping are of
   paramount importance. In this paper, an approach to quantify
   flow-induced damping of a relatively heavy fluid on a vibrating
   hydraulic turbine blade using numerical simulations is presented. First,
   mode shapes and frequencies of the immersed structure are obtained by
   modal analysis using the finite element method. Then, forced oscillatory
   modal motion is prescribed on the structural boundary of unsteady
   Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes flow simulations. Damping is finally
   computed as the normalized work done by the resulting fluid load on the
   structure. Validation is achieved by comparing the numerical results
   with available experimental data for a steel hydrofoil oscillating in
   flowing water. For this case, the linear increase in the damping ratio
   with the flow velocity is reproduced within 10\% of the experimental
   values. Application of the method to an actual hydroelectric propeller
   turbine blade yields a fluid damping value of around 15\% of critical
   damping for its first vibration mode.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasound is a viable imaging technology in remote and
   resources-limited areas. Ultrasonography is a user-dependent skill which
   depends on a high degree of training and hands-on experience. However,
   there is a limited number of skillful sonographers located in remote
   areas. In this work, we aim to develop a real-time video streaming
   platform which allows specialist physicians to remotely monitor
   ultrasound exams. To this end, an ultrasound stream is captured and
   transmitted through a wireless network into remote computers,
   smart-phones and tablets. In addition, the system is equipped with a
   camera to track the position of the ultrasound probe. The main advantage
   of our work is using an open source platform for video streaming which
   gives us more control over streaming parameters than the available
   commercial products. The transmission delays of the system are evaluated
   for several ultrasound video resolutions and the results show that
   ultrasound videos close to the high-definition (HD) resolution can be
   received and displayed on an Android tablet with the delay of 0.5
   seconds which is acceptable for accurate real-time diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{A class of optimal control problems with N agents where the agents have
   nonlinear dynamics, nonlinear cost functions and have mean field
   coupling in their cost functions are considered. The basic objective of
   the agents is to minimize a social cost which is the sum of the N
   individual cost functions. The exact socially optimal control policies
   require a centralized information structures for each agent and have
   high implementation complexity. Considering the mean field coupling in
   the cost functions and motivated by the analysis in mean field game
   theory, a decentralized cooperative optimization problem is formulated
   where each agent's control policy only depends on its own state and a
   function which may be computed offline. It is shown that the resulting
   set of strategies asymptotically achieves person-by-person optimality as
   N -> infinity where the essential idea is to formulate an (inverse)
   control problem which yields an optimum solution to the variation in the
   social cost that occurs due to the variation in an individual agent's
   control law.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, two metabolic networks representing the metabolism of CHO
   cells in fed-batch cultures are considered. The first metabolic network
   is relatively detailed and underdetermined with the available
   extracellular measurements, while the second is a reduced version of the
   former and is overdetermined. A dynamic metabolic flux analysis based on
   convex analysis (DMFCA) is applied to the detailed network, which allows
   the computation of the time evolution of bounded intervals. On the other
   hand, a linear optimization problem is solved for the reduced-size
   network, with either positivity constraints or box constraints inferred
   from DMFCA. In all cases, smoothing splines and mass balance
   differential equations are used to infer the time evolution of the
   uptake and excretion rates from experimental data. The analysis allows
   to get insight. into CHO metabolism as well as to investigate the
   influence of the size of the I I ietabolic network. (C) 2016 IFAC

Abstract = {{Deep neural networks with alternating convolutional, max-pooling and
   decimation layers are widely used in state of the art architectures for
   computer vision. Max-pooling purposefully discards precise spatial
   information in order to create features that are more robust, and
   typically organized as lower resolution spatial feature maps. On some
   tasks, such as whole-image classification, max-pooling derived features
   are well suited; however, for tasks requiring precise localization, such
   as pixel level prediction and segmentation, max-pooling destroys exactly
   the information required to perform well. Precise localization may be
   preserved by shallow convnets without pooling but at the expense of
   robustness. Can we have our max-pooled multilayered cake and eat it too?
   Several papers have proposed summation and concatenation based methods
   for combining upsampled coarse, abstract features with finer features to
   produce robust pixel level predictions. Here we introduce another
   model-dubbed Recombinator Networks where coarse features inform finer
   features early in their formation such that finer features can make use
   of several layers of computation in deciding how to use coarse features.
   The model is trained once, end-to-end and performs better than
   summation-based architectures, reducing the error from the previous
   state of the art on two facial keypoint datasets, AFW and AFLW, by 30\%
   and beating the current state-of-the-art on 300W without using extra
   data. We improve performance even further by adding a denoising
   prediction model based on a novel convnet formulation.}},

   just inspecting the user's handwriting activity. However, it is unclear
   whether the hardware of today's devices is capable to handle this task.
   To this end, we conducted a comparative study regarding the capabilities
   of past and current tablets to allow for the design of PDBs based on the

Abstract = {{Industrial control systems are not immune to cyber incidents. However,
   the support for incident responders and forensic investigators is low.
   In particular, there are limited journaling capabilities for operator
   actions. Barring the preservation of full packet captures and operator
   workstation security logs, which can generate unmanageable amounts of
   data on production networks, it is generally not possible to attribute
   control events (e.g., opening a valve or operating a breaker) to
   individual operators. This information can be necessary to perform
   security investigations, especially in cases involving malicious insider
   activities. This chapter presents a lightweight journaling system for
   SCADA networks based on event correlation. By correlating network events
   and operating system logs, a journal is generated of all Modbus protocol
   write events along with the usernames of the operators who performed the
   actions. The journal is much more compact than a full packet capture,
   achieving compression ratios of around 570 to 1 in conservative
   conditions and more than 2,000 to 1 in typical operating conditions,
   allowing for the preservation of valuable information for security
   investigations.}},

   function to estimate the maximum likelihood decoded message. The
   exponential function typically requires a very wide dynamic range. MPA
   is reformulated by replacing exponentials with simpler functions.
   Implementation complexity of the proposed simplified SCMA decoder was
   characterized using Vivado HLS targeting FPGA implementations. Results
   reported in this paper show that this approximate algorithm utilizes 10
   times fewer hardware resources than the original SCMA decoder and
   achieves an Area x Time complexity also reduced by a factor of 10.
   Moreover, when executed on a typical data-center processor, the run-time
   complexity is also reduced by a factor of 10. In terms of BER
   performance, up to 2.5 times improvement achieved for SNR less than 12
   dB as well.}},

Abstract = {{In the past 10 years, several researches studied video game development
   process who proposed approaches to improve the way how games are
   developed. These approaches usually adopt agile methodologies because of
   claims that traditional practices and the waterfall process are gone.
   However, are the ``old days{''} really gone in the game industry?
   In this paper, we present a survey of software engineering processes in
   video game industry from postmortem project analyses. We analyzed 20
   postmortems from Gamasutra Portal. We extracted their processes and
   modelled them through using the Business Process Model and Notation
   (BPMN).
   This work presents three main contributions. First, a postmortem
   analysis methodology to identify and extract project processes. Second,
   the study main result: the ``old days{''} are gone, but not completely.
   Iterative practices are increasing and are applied to at least 65\% of
   projects in which 45\% of this projects explicitly adopted Agile
   practices. However, waterfall process is still applied at least 30\% of
   projects. Finally, we discuss some implications, directions and
   opportunities for video game development community.}},

Abstract = {{Given that diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) may be able to provide
   additional information beyond T1 and T2 relaxation times regarding
   tissue anisotropy and microstructure, the aim of this study was to
   investigate DTI, T1 and T2 in detecting changes in the nucleus pulposus
   of the intervertebral disc (IVD) during enzyme digestion and highlight
   the effect of hydration. Fiftynine bovine caudal discs were separated
   into in situ, hydrated and trypsin-digested groups, and subjected to a
   multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition followed by
   confined compression test and biochemical assays. The effects of trypsin
   digestion versus hydration and of treatment versus duration on the MRI
   parameters were quantified by ANOVAs. T1 and T2 decreased progressively
   between the in situ and hydrated groups, increased progressively between
   the hydrated and digested groups, and did not change between the in situ
   and digested groups. Fractional anisotropy (FA) increased in the
   digested groups. The treatment had a significant effect on T1, T2 and
   FA, while its duration had a significant effect only on FA. FA was the
   most sensitive magnetic resonance parameter to the trypsin digestion of
   isolated IVDs. The effect of cleaving of proteoglycans due to trypsin
   digestion on T1 and T2 was hidden by the effect of hydration. For
   clinical applications and ex vivo studies, multi-parametric MRI should
   include DTI sequences to detect tissue-level changes when hydration is
   present.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the influence of both long and short skip
   connections on Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) for biomedical image
   segmentation. In standard FCNs, only long skip connections are used to
   skip features from the contracting path to the expanding path in order
   to recover spatial information lost during downsampling. We extend FCNs
   by adding short skip connections, that are similar to the ones
   introduced in residual networks, in order to build very deep FCNs (of
   hundreds of layers). A review of the gradient flow confirms that for a
   very deep FCN it is beneficial to have both long and short skip
   connections. Finally, we show that a very deep FCN can achieve
   near-to-state-of-the-art results on the EM dataset without any further
   post-processing.}},

Abstract = {{We present Buzz, a novel programming language for heterogeneous robot
   swarms. Buzz advocates a compositional approach, offering primitives to
   define swarm behaviors both from the perspective of the single robot and
   of the overall swarm. Single-robot primitives include robot specific
   instructions and manipulation of neighborhood data. Swarm-based
   primitives allow for the dynamic management of robot teams, and for
   sharing information globally across the swarm. Self-organization stems
   from the completely decentralized mechanisms upon which the Buzz
   run-time platform is based. The language can be extended to add new
   primitives (thus supporting heterogeneous robot swarms), and its
   run-time platform is designed to be laid on top of other frameworks,
   such as the Robot Operating System. We showcase the capabilities of Buzz
   by providing code examples, and analyze scalability and robustness of
   the run-time platform through realistic simulated experiments with
   representative swarm algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Considering the economic importance of forest products industries in

   and interactions of all the relevant entities involved in its supply

   characteristics to meet the needs of its final consumers. While a
   growing number of mathematical and simulation models are being presented
   for the SC in this sector, an integrated formal structure is evidently
   required for guiding the development of and evaluating these models.
   Therefore, in this research, we systematically review and identify
   existing frameworks for modelling SCs with the interest of highlighting
   the ones relevant to the forest products SCs. While we find no framework
   specific to the forest products industry, we identify a number of
   existing frameworks that could be customized to represent the industry's

   solution with precursors ratio Cu:In:S = 1.3:1:3.9, 1.4:1:3.9,
   1.5:1:3.9. CuInS2 thin films were obtained from a solution of methanol
   with precursors ratio Cu: In: S = 1:1:4. The In concentration was 3 x
   10(-3) mol/l. The crystalline structure and their morphology ware
   characterised by SEM and their chemical composition by EDAX, The bandgap
   of CuInS2, equals to 1.40 eV, was determined by spectrophotometry.}},

   network automatically acquires the knowledge by the back propagation
   algorithm and trains the connectionist structure to refine the fuzzy

Abstract = {{In real time systems, random caches have been proposed as a way to
   simplify software timing analysis, by avoiding corner cases usually
   found in deterministic systems. Using this random approach, one can
   obtain an application's probabilistic Worst Case Execution Time (pWCET)
   to be used for timing analysis. As with deterministic systems,
   technology scaling in cache memories is making transient and permanent
   faults more likely, which in turn affects the system's timing behavior.
   To mitigate these effects, one can introduce a detection mechanism that
   classifies a fault as transient or permanent, with the goal of disabling
   permanently faulty cache blocks to avoid future accesses. In this paper,
   we compare the effects of two online detection mechanisms for permanent
   faults, namely rule-based detection and Dynamic Hidden Markov Model
   (D-HMM) based detection, for the generation of safe pWCET estimates.
   Experimental results show that different mechanisms can greatly affect
   safe pWCET margins, and that by using D-HMM the pWCET of the system can
   be improved compared to rule-based detection.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an automated tool chain for simulating Francis
   turbine behavior during the transient processes induced by a load
   rejection event. The proposed methodology combines a commercial CFD
   solver and a user function and scripts to address the simulation
   challenges caused by the wicket gate motion and runner speed variation
   during emergency shutdown. Mesh deformation and re-meshing techniques
   are used to simulate the large displacement of the wicket gates. The
   runner speed variation is computed using an angular momentum equation
   implemented in a user defined function. The proposed methodology was
   developed and validated by performing 2D unsteady simulations on a high
   head model Francis turbine used in the Francis-99 workshop, followed by
   a 3D unsteady simulations on a medium head Francis turbine. These
   simulations allow computing the evolution of engineering quantities such
   as turbine angular speed, flow physics and unsteady load on blades
   during the process. The validation of CFD results with experiments
   showed 9\% discrepancy in the prediction of runaway speed. The
   investigation of flow physics reveals the presence of complex flow
   structures such as reversed flow (pumping flow) near the draft tube cone
   center and a downward tangential flow near the cone wall of the draft
   tube. Pressure fluctuations are captured when the Francis turbine
   operating point moves through conditions of zero and negative torque.
   The proposed methodology is fast and simple to present a qualitative
   analysis of the flow physics and the turbine behavior during load
   rejection.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the globalization of software development, relevant
   documentation of a project, such as requirements and design documents,
   often still is missing, incomplete or outdated. However, parts of that
   documentation can be found outside the project, where it is fragmented
   across hundreds of textual web documents like blog posts, email messages
   and forum posts, as well as multimedia documents such as screencasts and
   podcasts. Since dissecting and filtering multimedia information based on
   its relevancy to a given project is an inherently difficult task, it is
   necessary to provide an automated approach for mining this crowd-based
   documentation. In this paper, we are interested in mining the speech
   part of YouTube screencasts, since this part typically contains the
   rationale and insights of a screencast. We introduce a methodology that
   transcribes and analyzes the transcribed text using various Information
   Extraction (IE) techniques, and present a case study to illustrate the
   applicability of our mining methodology. In this case study, we extract
   use case scenarios from WordPress tutorial videos and show how their
   content can supplement existing documentation. We then evaluate how well
   existing rankings of video content are able to pinpoint the most
   relevant videos for a given scenario.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to project power has traditionally been defined as the
   ability to deploy conventional military assets across the world. While
   this definition does not apply to a cyber context, cyber forces can
   still play a role in force projection. By studying the cases of the
   denial of services attack targeting Estonia in 2007, the Shamoon worm
   attack of 2012 and the Sony Pictures hack of 2014 as examples of power
   projection, it is possible to forecast future trends in cyber power
   projection. Notably, the case studies will show that it is possible to
   threaten both tangible and intangible assets with cyber attacks. In
   addition, the case studies will underline the importance of the
   credibility of the threat for the effectiveness of projection of power,
   which is influenced both by the perceived capability of the attacker and
   on the ability to sustain the damage. The case studies also highlight
   cyber as a means for nation states to project power far outside of their
   traditional scope, leveraging the loose attributability of cyber force
   projection for more freedom of action. Based on these observations, the
   aim of the paper is to anticipate the trajectory of future trends for
   cyber force projection. First, increased signalling of capabilities
   would be expected to strengthen the credibility of cyber threats.
   Second, continued improvement of the ability to apply and sustain cyber
   attacks is expected to continue due to the increased virtualization of
   assets of national interest and the increase in pathways for cyber
   mediated impacts on more traditional assets thanks to the Internet of
   Things (IoT).}},

Abstract = {{Methacrylic acid (MAA) is a specialty intermediate to
   producemethylmethacrylate (MMA), which is amonomer for poly methyl
   methacrylate. Current processes to MMA and MAA rely on expensive
   feedstocks and multi-step processes. Here we investigate the gas-phase
   oxidation of 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol (2MPDO) to MAA over
   heteropolycompounds as effective catalysts, finding that the maximum
   selectivity to MAA was 41\% with 63\% conversion of reactant at 250
   degrees C over Cs(NH4)(2)PMo12O40(VO)Cu-0.5. Cesium (Cs) stabilized the
   catalyst structure at 250 degrees C, and vanadium(V) and copper (Cu)
   played a positive role as an oxidant and promoter, respectively. A 0.3
   mm nozzle atomized the liquid reactant over the catalyst surface into a
   mu-fluidized bed reactor. The proposed Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
   model predicts MAA selectivity based on 2MPDO and oxygen compositions
   and catalyst components (Cs, V, Cu) as independent factors. The model
   accounts for 97\% of the variance in the data (R-2 = 0.97). Vanadium as
   a catalyst component and oxygen concentration are the two most
   significant factors. Genetic algorithms (GA) coupled with ANN modeling
   optimized the input parameters to improve the selectivity. The
   selectivity to MAA over the optimized catalyst (Cs(NH4)
   2PMo12O40(VO)Cu-0.15) and optimum feed compositions (2MPDO/O-2/Ar =
   13\%/10\%/77\%) was 43\% at 250 degrees C.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2544}},
Pages = {{71-80}},
Abstract = {{Simulation models are vital instruments for properly evaluating proposed
   interventions on the public transport network. Because of data
   constraints, traditional planning models have been based on simplified
   representations of supply and demand. The goal of this paper is to
   demonstrate the feasibility of constructing a highly detailed public
   transit microsimulation model using general transit feed specification
   (GTFS) (complete planned service in the form of schedules transmitted to
   the public) and smart card data collected from a surface bus network.
   Since the validation protocol is tap-in only and the validation
   equipment by default provides no location information, algorithms are
   developed to derive boarding and alighting locations by using the
   recorded times of the fare validations. The GTFS schedule data are
   transformed into network format. The smart card data and GTFS data
   generate, respectively, highly detailed representations of transit
   demand and supply that are ideally suited for analysis using a powerful
   microsimulation tool (in this case, TRANSIMS). The results of these
   procedures demonstrate the feasibility of using smart card data and GTFS
   data as the basis for simulation of a surface transit network and offer
   the potential to dramatically increase the precision and versatility of
   public transport planning.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a multi-channel full-duplex Medium Access
   Control (MAC) protocol for cognitive radio networks (MFDC-MAC). Our
   design exploits the fact that full-duplex (FD) secondary users (SUs) can
   perform spectrum sensing and access simultaneously, and we employ the
   randomized dynamic channel selection for load balancing among channels
   and the standard backoff mechanism for contention resolution on each
   available channel. Then, we develop a mathematical model to analyze the
   throughput performance of the proposed MFDC-MAC protocol. Furthermore,
   we study the protocol configuration optimization to maximize the network
   throughput where we show that this optimization can be performed in two
   steps, namely optimization of access and transmission parameters on each
   channel and optimization of channel selection probabilities of the
   users. Such optimization aims at achieving efficient self-interference
   management for FD transceivers, sensing overhead control, and load
   balancing among the channels. Numerical results demonstrate the impacts
   of different protocol parameters and the importance of parameter
   optimization on the throughput performance as well as the significant
   performance gain of the proposed design compared to traditional design.}},

Abstract = {{The Darcy model with the Boussinesq approximation is used to study both
   analytically and numerically natural convection in a porous medium
   saturated by a Newtonian fluid. The geometry considered is a rectangular
   cavity heated from below and cooled from above by a constant heat flux
   while the sidewalls are maintained adiabatic. The governing parameters
   for the problem are the thermal Darcy-Rayleigh number R and the aspect
   ratio of the cavity A. In the limit of extremely confined geometries the
   parallel flow approximation is used to predict the flow behavior in the
   case of a tall vertical layer (A >> 1) or shallow horizontal one (A <<
   1). For a tall cavity, the existence of multicellular flow patterns,
   consisting of m vertical cells, is predicted by the present analytical
   model. Also, for a shallow cavity, it is demonstrated that the flow
   pattern can be either unicellular or multicellular. This is confirmed by
   the numerical results obtained by solving the full governing equations.}},

Abstract = {{The adoption of Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) architecture is a
   technological trend in the avionics industry due to its capability of
   supporting space and temporal partitioning, which is mandatory for
   systems with mixed criticality. However, combining partition allocation
   and schedule design for applications sharing hardware, software, and
   communication resources of the same computing platform while assuring
   temporal behavior is a complex task that requires adequate tools for
   system design and integration. This paper presents the main features of
   a model that has been developed for simultaneous partition allocation
   and schedule design, which allows for automatic adjustment of both
   applications distribution over the partitions and scheduling parameters
   toward performance optimization. In the proposed model, all the
   variables are integer and all constraints are formulated via linear
   equalities and inequalities. Therefore, this problem can be efficiently
   solved by many existing mixed integer linear programming algorithms. A
   set of timing constraints at both partition and task levels are
   established, and different optimization objective functions are
   provided. The results of a case study show that, if a solution exists,
   the proposed model can achieve a global optimum while guaranteeing that
   all the constraints are met.}},

Abstract = {{The CAE benchmarking project is an industrial project assigned to eight
   undergraduate students from Ecole Polytechnique de Montral to help CAE
   Inc. implement in their simulators a more efficient hardware solution
   for the Cockpit Display System (CDS) using ARINC 661 standard. Students
   use the latest technology software available to the aerospace industry
   such as VAPS XT to design and implement the CDS and create an
   architecture for benchmarking purposes. This paper also outlines briefly
   the potential benefits that can materialize with such collaborations
   between universities and the aeronautical industry at the undergraduate
   level.
   Based on the tests performed using standard ARINC 661 widgets, the
   students were able to gather relevant data in a simulation environment.
   They were able to characterize the relationships between the required
   graphics display performance and the hardware parameters of the
   proprietary card known as CAE-MPIC, such as CPU/GPU consumption, memory
   usage, and latency.
   This collaboration project has enabled the students to provide CAE with
   significant data in order to decide to carry on or re-scope their
   graphics development project. Outsourcing R\&D projects to undergraduate
   students is a very effective cost-saving and risk-mitigating approach to
   non-critical industrial projects and an excellent way to immerse the
   future engineers in a real world environment.}},

   a feature in context descriptor. This descriptor is thus unique for a
   feature in an ensemble of features. Many medical and industrial imaging

   Automatic anomaly detection could be implemented using this technique,
   thanks to the fact that this descriptor forms a metric space. Metric

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a probabilistic approach to segmentation of
   malignant breast masses which have irregular shape, spiculated margins
   and which may be embedded in high density glandular tissue. First, we
   perform contrast enhancement of the image using a simple logarithmic
   transformation. Then, we derive a segmentation technique based on a
   specific class of Markov random fields (MRFs) known as Pickard random
   fields. As opposed to most MRF-based methods which require complex and
   time-consuming computations, our approach is simple, much faster and
   nearly unsupervised as it only requires specification of the number of
   levels on the MRF. Tests performed on 48 malignant masses extracted from
   the INbreast database revealed that the proposed approach yields
   superior results while being robust with respect to the high variability
   of mammograms.}},

Abstract = {{Behaviors of distributed systems with many cores and/or many threads are
   difficult to understand. This is why dynamic analysis tools such as
   tracers are useful to collect run-time data and help programmers debug
   and optimize complex programs. However, manual trace analysis on very
   large traces with billions of events can be a difficult problem which
   automated trace visualizers and analyzers aim to solve. Trace analysis
   and visualization software needs fast access to data which it cannot
   achieve by searching through the entire trace for every query. A number
   of solutions have adopted stateful analysis which rearranges events into
   a more query friendly structures after a single pass through the trace.
   In this paper, we look into current implementations and model the
   behavior of previous work, the State History Tree (SHT), on traces with
   many thread creation and deletion. This allows us to identify which
   properties of the SHT are responsible for inefficient disk usage and
   high memory consumption. We then propose a more efficient data
   structure, the enhanced State History Tree (eSHT), to store and query
   computed states, in order to limit disk usage and reduce the query time
   for any state. Next, we compare the use of SHT and eSHT on traces with
   many attributes. We finally verify the scalability of our new data
   structure according to trace size.
   As shown by our results, the proposed solution makes near optimal use of
   disk space, reduces the algorithm's memory usage logarithmically for
   previously problematic cases, and speeds up queries on traces with many
   attributes by an order of magnitude. The proposed solution builds upon
   our previous work, enabling it to easily scale up to traces containing a
   million threads.}},

   the cantilever deflection. Herein we also put forward a custom-made

   changes and for data acquisition purposes. Furthermore, we demonstrate
   and discuss the fabrication and characterization and spirometry results.
   Based on these results, the device is used for measuring the breathing

   stimulation. Current mode digital-toanalog converters are used to
   generate the cathodic and the anodic stimulation phases. A
   sample-and-hold and a window comparator circuit are used to compare the
   voltage of the electrode and the tissue with a target value within a
   safe voltage range of -50 mV to +50 mV. When the electrode voltage falls
   below the lower bound or above the upper bound of such a safe voltage
   range, the anodic stimulation pulse width is modified in such a way that
   the electrode voltage remains in the safe range. High-level pulse
   shrinking (HLPS) and low-level pulse shrinking (HLPS) elements are used
   in digital part to modify anodic pulse width. Simulation results for the
   proposed circuit implemented in a 0.18-mu m 1P6M CMOS technology confirm
   proper functioning and show that the proposed circuit requires extremely
   low power compared to other charge balancing schemes, with a power
   consumption of 4.2 mu W.}},

Abstract = {{Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an important part of many applications,
   such as in wireless communication based on OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency
   Division Multiplexing). With Cloud Radio Access Networks, implementing
   FFTs on multiprocessor clusters is a challenging task. For instance,
   supporting the Long Term Evolution (LTE) protocol requires processing
   100 independent FFTs (with sizes ranging from 128 to 2048 points) in
   66.7 mu s. In this work, seven native FFT candidate implementations are
   compared. The considered implementation environments are: OpenMP (Open
   Multi-Processing) on 1 core, MPI (Message Passing Interface) on 1 core,
   2 cores, and 3 cores, Hybrid OpenMP+MPI on 1 core and 3 cores, and MPI
   on an heterogeneous platform composed of Xeon-Phi and 3 cores. The
   reported experimental results show that the latter method meets the
   latency requirements of LTE. It is shown that the OpenMP and MPI
   paradigms running only on MICs (Many Integrated Cores) cannot benefit
   fully from the computing capability of many-core architectures. The
   heterogeneous combination of Xeon+MICs provides a better performance.}},

Abstract = {{When dealing with node or link failures in Software Defined Networking
   (SDN), the network capability to establish an alternative path depends
   on controller reachability and on the round trip times (RTTs) between
   controller and involved switches. Moreover, current SDN data plane
   abstractions for failure detection (e.g. OpenFlow ``Fast-failover{''})
   do not allow programmers to tweak switches' detection mechanism, thus
   leaving SDN operators still relying on proprietary management interfaces
   (when available) to achieve guaranteed detection and recovery delays. We
   propose SPIDER, an OpenFlow-like pipeline design that provides i) a
   detection mechanism based on switches' periodic link probing and ii)
   fast reroute of traffic flows even in case of distant failures,
   regardless of controller availability. SPIDER can be implemented using
   stateful data plane abstractions such as OpenState or Open vSwitch, and
   it offers guaranteed short (i.e. ms) failure detection and recovery
   delays, with a configurable trade off between overhead and failover
   responsiveness. We present here the SPIDER pipeline design, behavioral
   model, and analysis on flow tables' memory impact. We also implemented
   and experimentally validated SPIDER using OpenState (an OpenFlow 1.3
   extension for stateful packet processing), showing numerical results on
   its performance in terms of recovery latency and packet losses.}},

Abstract = {{For decades, the notion of software quality evaluation is raised as a
   challenging task. Recently many studies have presented quality
   evaluation methodologies for specific domains or specific techniques.
   They usually select a pre-defined model, customize the characteristics,
   define the metrics and evaluate the quality of the product or
   development process. Our study presents a bottom-up methodology for the
   quality evaluation process. In this paper, we present a methodology to
   create the expected quality profile. In our approach, the first step is
   listening to the users, and then retrieving the most important quality
   factors and creating a model to evaluate the expected quality of the
   software product. The profile is formed by eliciting the expected users'
   quality expectations, and then quantifying the elicited factors by
   applying them to our quality evaluation model and the ISO/IEC 25000
   standard. The result of this research empowers the software development
   stakeholders to perform a crosscheck between users' specific quality
   expectations and other drivers (functional and architecture/design
   requirements), before or during the software development process. The
   crosscheck aims to guarantee that there are enough activities, roles and
   artifacts in the software development process to support the users'
   quality requirements.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the problem of fault tolerant control for
   discrete-time switching systems under an arbitrary switching signal.
   Sufficient conditions for designing an observer are obtained using
   multiple Lyapunov function and H-infinity techniques. A Sufficient
   condition for the solvability of this problem is established in terms of
   linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The obtained results are applied on a
   numerical example showing fault detection, localization of fault and
   reconfiguration of the control to maintain asymptotic stability, even in
   the presence of a permanent sensor fault.}},

Abstract = {{Since the discovery of Stuxnet, it is no secret that skilled adversaries
   target industrial control systems. To defend against this threat,
   defenders increasingly rely on intrusion detection and segmentation. As
   the security posture improves, it is likely that the attackers will move
   to stealthier approaches, such as covert channels. This paper presents a
   command and control (C\&C) covert channel over the Modbus/TCP protocol
   that represents the next logical step for the attackers and evaluates
   its suitability. The channel stores information in the least significant
   bits of holding registers to carry information using Modbus read and
   write methods. This offers an explicit tradeoff between the bandwidth
   and stealth of the channel that can be set by the attacker.}},

Abstract = {{Equipment usually consists of many components arranged in hierarchical

   give a nomenclature to describe a system composed of multiple

   age-based and an opportunistic preventive maintenance strategies is
   modeled by using a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Then, near-optimal
   policies are found through the SARSA(A) algorithm from Reinforcement
   Learning (RL), where the expected discounted cost is minimized.
   Simulation experiments to compare near-optimal policies obtained by
   SARSA(A) are performed for both strategies with corrective maintenance
   and with age-based preventive maintenance policy obtained from renewal
   reward theory. We show that the proposed opportunistic preventive
   maintenance outperforms other strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Laser triangulation is an optical measuring method which characterizes
   with relatively high precision. There are many factors which can affect
   this type of measurement. They depend on a nature of optical
   measurements. Equally important from the viewpoint of accuracy is how
   precisely the position of the scanner in measuring volume is determined.
   In this paper we present tests performed using measuring arm equipped
   with a laser scanner. As in measuring arms position of the probe depends
   on the accuracy of angular encoders their influence on the results was
   tested. Five different strategies were chosen to show the significance
   of employment of additional encoders. Results showed that if less
   encoders are used, better results are obtained. Also overlapping of
   individual scans affects precision of results. Therefore one should pay
   attention on choosing proper measuring strategy, to not change the
   scanning direction excessively and to not scan the same area many times.}},

   parameters enable to distinguish between normal and pathological voices.
   Three types of pathologies are used to test the method: Laryngeal
   Diseases, Parkinson and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Preliminary
   results show that the novel features proposed are able to distinguish
   between parameters of normal and pathological voice. Moreover, it is

Abstract = {{Lignin represents 15\% to 40\% of the dry weight of lignocellulosic
   biomass but remains under exploited as a sustainable feedstock for
   chemical and fuels even though it is the only bio-polymer with aromatic
   units. Technology that selectively converts lignin to value added
   specialities would improve the economics of the burgeoning bio-refinery
   industry. Here, we introduce a two stage gas-phase catalytic process
   that produces carboxylic acids and aromatics from lignin while
   minimizing coke and char and maintaining catalyst activity. In the first
   step, a mixture of 50\% water vapour in air crack and partially oxidize
   this complex macromolecule (<550 degrees C). The effluent gas contacts
   heterogeneous mixed-metal oxides or metal catalysts in the second step.
   The product profile from the second step includes aromatic compounds but
   mostly C-4 carboxylic acids such as maleic acid and butyric acid.
   Vanadium catalysts cleave lignin bonds, open aromatic rings and oxidize
   lignin to carboxylic acids, especially maleic acid. WO3/TiO2 mostly gave
   butyric acid. Basic catalysts produced more aromatic compounds. The
   maximum amount of coke was 5\% of the total carbon in lignin.}},

   transient type (EMT-type) simulations is challenging due to numerous

   require long computation times. Simplified and averaged models have been

   types of model require a hard-coding development which depends on the
   EMT software used. This article presents a simple approach for modelling
   these types of MMC using only generic EMT blocks (i.e. power circuits
   and control components) that can be found in most EMT software
   libraries. In addition, the article describes, step-by-step, the
   intermediate circuits and the mathematical assumptions made that lead
   from one type of model to another. The INELFE link is used as a real

Abstract = {{In this paper, a fuzzy classification with quantification algorithm is
   proposed for solving the air quality monitoring problem using e-noses.
   When e-noses are used in dynamic outdoor environment, the performance
   suffers from noise, signal drift and fast-changing natural environment.
   The question is, how to develop a prediction model capable of detecting
   as well as quantifying gases effectively and efficiently? The current
   research work has focused either on detection or quantification of
   sensor response without taking into account of dynamic factors. In this
   paper, we propose a new model, namely, Fuzzy Classification with
   Quantification Model (FCQM) to cope with the above mentioned challenges.
   To evaluate our model, we conducted extensive experiments on a publicly
   available datasets generated over a three-year period, and the results
   demonstrate its superiority over other baseline methods. To our
   knowledge, gas type detection together with quantification is an
   unsolved challenge. Our paper provides the first solution for this kind.}},

Abstract = {{The SAE standard Time-triggered Ethernet defines a strong networking
   infrastructure, which supports the engineering of avionic systems.
   Avionic functions are often designed independently and integrated to
   form the avionic system. The iterative integration approach helps in
   controlling the design complexity of evolving avionic systems and aims
   at minimizing the cost associate with the reconfiguration of scheduling
   parameters of already integrated parts. On the other hand, the iterative
   approach requires to specify and manage a huge set of constraints, which
   are then solved to compute the optimal scheduling parameters. In this
   paper, we focus on this issue of manual specification of these
   constraints by the system engineer. We propose a model-driven approach,
   which provides the required abstractions and automation to support the
   system engineer in using effectively the iterative integration approach.
   The abstractions consist in a metamodel, which describes the system at a
   given integration step and a metamodel for the constraints. The
   automation consists in a model transformation which enables generating
   automatically the relevant constraints at integration step.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides an optical characterization and numerical prediction
   of local deformations appearing on the visible side of composite
   sandwich panels used for interior furniture of business airplanes.
   During manufacturing of furniture panels, metallic inserts are bonded
   inside the sandwich panel using an epoxy adhesive. Surface defects
   appear on the visible side of the panels due to curing of the adhesive,
   but also because of temperature gradients and humidity during
   manufacturing and in service. This paper presents an optical
   characterization based on deflectometry principle, that allows
   qualitative and quantitative analyses of the surface deformations in
   3-dimensions. In addition, this paper presents a parametric model based
   on finite elements to predict the formation of surface defects using
   ABAQUS. A comparison is presented between the experimental observations
   and numerical predictions with good agreement between them.}},

Abstract = {{Erythrocytes have the tendency to aggregate under blood stagnation and
   low shear conditions. This phenomenon increases scattering and the
   echogenicity of blood. Increased erythrocyte aggregation (EA) has been
   proposed as a surrogate marker for real-time detection of acute
   inflammation. Therefore, it is of interest to develop a reproducible
   technique for in vivo characterization of EA. The main difficulty to
   achieve this goal is to evaluate the phenomenon under controlled
   conditions of shear rate. We propose a technique to automatically
   segment vascular regions of comparable shear based on the analysis of
   sequences of ultrasound images using particle image velocimetry (PIV).
   We aim to validate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed
   technique, using both in vivo and ex vivo datasets. After segmentation,
   ultrasound images were characterized using the structure factor size and
   attenuation estimator based on spectral analysis. The quantitative
   ultrasound parameters inferred by automatic segmentation were compared
   to those of manual segmentation made by a human expert. No significant
   differences were found between the aggregate size estimated from
   automatic and manual segmentations. However the attenuation parameter
   showed significant differences, showing the need to regularize the
   inverse problem. These results suggest that the algorithm is a robust
   alternative to expert segmentation and present the advantage of being
   operator independent.}},

Abstract = {{A bacterium capable of degrading five microcystin (MC) variants,
   microcystin-LR, YR, LY, LW and LF at an initial total concentration of
   50 mu g l(-1) in less than 16 hours was isolated from Missisquoi Bay, in
   the south of Quebec, Canada. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene
   sequence identified the bacterium as Sphingopyxis sp., designated strain
   MB-E. It was shown that microcystin biodegradation activity was reduced
   at acidic and basic pH values. Even though no biodegradation occurred at
   pH values of 5.05 and 10.23, strain MB-E was able to degrade MCLR and
   MCYR at pH 9.12 and all five MCs variants tested at pH 6.1. Genomic
   sequencing revealed that strain MB-E contained the microcystin degrading
   gene cluster, including the mlrA, mlrB, mlrC and mlrD genes, and
   transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that all of these genes were
   induced during the degradation of MCLR alone or in the mixture of all
   five MCs. This novel transcriptomic analysis showed that the expression
   of the mlr gene cluster was similar for MCLR alone, or the mixture of
   MCs, and appeared to be related to the total concentration of substrate.
   The results suggested that the bacterium used the same pathway for the
   degradation of all MC variants.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing is currently the most popular model to offer and access
   computational resources and services. Many cloud providers use the REST
   architectural style (Representational State Transfer) for offering such
   computational resources. However, these cloud providers face challenges
   when designing and exposing REST APIs that are easy to handle by
   end-users and/or developers. Yet, they benefit from best practices to
   help them design understandable and reusable REST APIs.
   However, these best practices are scattered in the literature and they
   have not be studied systematically on real-world APIs. Consequently, we
   propose two contributions. In our first contribution, we survey the
   literature and compile a catalog of 73 best practices in the design of
   REST APIs making APIs more understandable and reusable. In our second
   contribution, we perform a study of three different and well-known REST
   APIs from three cloud providers to investigate how their APIs are
   offered and accessed. These cloud providers are Google Cloud Platform,
   OpenStack, and Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI). In particular, we
   evaluate the coverage of the features provided by the REST APIs of these
   cloud providers and their conformance with the best practices for REST
   APIs design.
   Our results show that Google Cloud follows 66\% (48/73), OpenStack
   follows 62\% (45/73), and OCCI 1.2 follows 56\% (41/73) of the best
   practices. Second, although these numbers are not necessarily high,
   partly because of the strict and precise specification of best
   practices, we showed that cloud APIs reach an acceptable level of
   maturity.}},

Abstract = {{Characterization of a Sparse Code Multiple Access (SCMA) decoder is
   performed to measure its error performance and its time and hardware
   implementation complexity. SCMA is a non-orthogonal technique proposed
   to support massive connectivity in future 56 wireless telecommunication
   systems. The reported SCMA decoder is based on the Message Passing
   Algorithm (MPA). The complexity of SCMA decoding is characterized to
   identity its implementation bottlenecks. This paper shows how latency
   and complexity can be reduced with implementations leveraging parallel
   techniques and high level synthesis. The reported design space
   exploration allows reducing power and energy consumption.}},
