Abstract = {{In this paper, ultra-wideband (UWB) Marchand baluns using substrate
   integrated coaxial line (SICL) technology are first proposed. SICL is a
   shielded planar coaxial line, which is very suitable for wideband and
   high-speed applications due to its broad unimodal operation band, low
   insertion loss, very small dispersion, and easy integration with other
   planar circuits. In order to achieve wider bandwidth and better VSWR
   performance of the SICL balun, a pair of quarter-wave impedance
   transformers are inserted into the balanced line. The impedance
   characteristics of the proposed SICL baluns are analyzed, and the
   parameters that determine the balun bandwidth are discussed. Then,
   curves of the balun resistance, reactance, and the SICL characteristic
   impedance are presented. According to these curves, the design
   parameters of the proposed SICL baluns can easily be determined. To
   verify these ideas, an UWB SICL single balun and an UWB SICL dual balun
   are designed, fabricated, and measured. Both full-wave simulated and
   measured results are presented, and good agreement between them is
   observed. The proposed SICL baluns have a simple structure and good
   performance, which are suitable for applications in UWB communication
   systems.}},

   As the evolution of modes is analyzed, a lower tuning efficiency and a
   larger tuning range are obtained compared to Bragg mirror cavities. New
   behavior also emerges such as the possibility to tune the inner
   interface from being a node to an antinode of the standing wave electric
   field, and therefore the possibility to provide enhancement of emission
   of nanoemitters binding to the inner interfaces of the cavity, such as
   in microfluidic microassay systems. (c) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

   nonlinear materials can introduce a wavelength shift in a uniform
   grating's second harmonic intensity peak and strongly influences the
   bandwidth and ripple in the harmonic conversion response of chirped

Abstract = {{Atmospheric pressure (AP) dielectric barrier discharges (DBDs) are
   increasingly used to treat thermally-sensitive materials. Reliable
   measurements of the kinetic gas temperature, T, are therefore of capital

   are often tacitly assumed to be equal to T. Here, we measured T with
   fibre-optic instrumentation that is a priori immune towards high
   voltages and high-frequency electromagnetic fields generally encountered
   in plasmas. Finding Trot?>?T in AP glow discharge (APGD) DBDs in He and
   Ne, we believe that Trot?approximate to?T only during the short
   (approximate to mu s) current peaks that characterize APGD. Therefore, T
   represents the time-averaged gas temperature; calorimetric measurements
   using a thermocouple buried in an electrode support this view.}},

   cell viability, uniformity and seeding efficiency of tubular constructs.
   Quantification methods and imaging techniques were used to evaluate
   these parameters on the luminal and abluminal sides of fibrous polymer
   scaffolds. With the automated seeding method, a high cell-seeding
   efficiency similar to 89\%), viability similar to 85\%) and uniformity
   similar to 8592\%) were achieved for both aortic smooth muscle cells
   (AoSMCs) and aortic endothelial cells (AoECs). The duration of the
   seeding process was?<?8?min. Initial cell density, cell suspension in
   matrix-containing media, duration of seeding process and scaffold
   rotation were found to affect the seeding efficiency. After few days of
   culture, a uniform longitudinal and circumferential cell distribution
   was achieved without affecting cell viability. Both cell types were
   viable and spread along the fibres after 28?h and 6?days of static
   incubation. This new automated cell-seeding method for tubular scaffolds

   polymerization (ROMP) was studied as a function of the reaction

   reaction was still effective in a large temperature domain (-15-45
   degrees C), occurring at very short time scales (less than 1 min at 40
   degrees C). On the other hand, the micro-indentation analysis performed
   on the SWCNT/5E2N nanocomposite material after its ROMP polymerization
   showed a clear increase in both the hardness and the Young modulus-up to
   nine times higher than that of the virgin polymer-when SWCNT loads range

Abstract = {{Personalized therapies play an increasingly critical role in cancer
   care: Image guidance with multimodality image fusion facilitates the
   targeting of specific tissue for tissue characterization and plays a
   role in drug discovery and optimization of tailored therapies.
   Positron-emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
   and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) may offer additional
   information not otherwise available to the operator during minimally
   invasive image-guided procedures, such as biopsy and ablation. With use
   of multimodality image fusion for image-guided interventions, navigation
   with advanced modalities does not require the physical presence of the
   PET, MRI, or CT imaging system. Several commercially available methods
   of image-fusion and device navigation are reviewed along with an
   explanation of common tracking hardware and software. An overview of
   current clinical applications for multimodality navigation is provided.}},

Abstract = {{In image processing, nonconvex regularization has the ability to smooth
   homogeneous regions and sharpen edges but leads to challenging
   computation. We propose some iterative schemes to minimize the energy
   function with nonconvex edge-preserving potential. The schemes are
   derived from the duality-based algorithm proposed by Berm dez and Moreno
   and the fixed point iteration. The convergence is proved for the convex
   energy function with nonconvex potential and the linear convergence rate
   is given. Applying the proposed schemes to Perona and Malik's nonconvex
   regularization, we present some efficient algorithms based on our
   schemes, and show the approximate convergence behavior for nonconvex
   energy function. Experimental results are presented, which show the
   efficiency of our algorithms, including better denoised performance of
   nonconvex regularization, faster convergence speed, higher calculation
   precision, lower calculation cost under the same number of iterations,

Abstract = {{Fast reaching movements are an important component of our daily
   interaction with the world and are consequently under investigation in
   many fields of science and engineering. Today, useful models are
   available for such studies, with tools for solving the inverse dynamics
   problem involved by these analyses. These tools generally provide a set
   of model parameters that allows an accurate and locally optimal
   reconstruction of the original movements. Although the solutions that
   they generate may provide a data curve fitting that is sufficient for
   some pattern recognition applications, the best possible solution is
   often necessary in others, particularly those involving neuroscience and
   biomedical signal processing. To generate these solutions, we present a
   globally optimal parameter extractor for the delta-lognormal modeling of
   reaching movements based on the branch-and-bound strategy. This
   algorithm is used to test the impact of white noise on the
   delta-lognormal modeling of reaching movements and to benchmark the
   state-of-the-art locally optimal algorithm. Our study shows that, even
   with globally optimal solutions, parameter averaging is important for
   obtaining reliable figures. It concludes that physiologically derived
   rules are necessary, in addition to global optimality, to achieve
   meaningful Delta Lambda extractions which can be used to investigate the
   control patterns of these movement primitives.}},

Abstract = {{Polylactide (PLA) and PLA/organo-modified clay nanocomposites were found
   to experience severe thermal degradation during processing via internal
   mixer and twin-screw extruder. Rheological dynamic time sweep
   measurements were used to monitor the thermal degradation. The
   organo-modified clay was believed to accelerate the PLA matrix thermal
   degradation due to the presence of the organo-modifier. The acceleration
   effect of the organo-modified clay was highly dependent on the
   exfoliation extent, with a higher exfoliation extent resulting in a more
   intense thermal degradation. Three reactive chain extenders,
   hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI), pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) and
   Joncryl (R) ADR-4368, were mixed to the PLA matrix during processing. It
   was found that Joncryl and HDI had a much higher chain extension
   reactivity than PMDA, and that they substantially increased the
   molecular weight of the PLA matrix. The addition of 0.5 wt\% Joncryl
   during twin-screw extrusion increased the complex viscosity from 4700 Pa
   s for the neat PLA to about 23,000 Pa s. The chain extender HDI has
   bi-reactive end groups per molecule; therefore, extended PLA molecules
   with a mostly linear structure were obtained. Since Joncryl is a
   multi-functional reactive polymer, the molecular structure of the PLA
   matrix changed from linear to a branched or cross-linked structure
   depending on Joncryl loading and processing temperature, as confirmed by
   H-1-NMR analysis. Joncryl also showed a remarkable thermal stabilization
   effect on PLA/organo-modified clay nanocomposites containing up to 6
   wt\% of Cloisite (R) 30B without negatively affecting the clay
   dispersion. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{60-71}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Peen forming is a versatile and flexible manufacturing process commonly
   used in the aerospace industry to shape wing skins and rockets panels.
   Development of peening parameters needed to obtain a specific component
   shape can be both costly and challenging due to the use of empirical
   methods which involve large quantities of physical experiments coupled
   with trial and error processing of prototype components. Many iterations
   are often required to get the desired shape with no guarantee that a
   specific component geometry can be achieved. Reliable numerical
   simulations could substantially reduce the time, cost and risk
   associated with process development. The purpose of this study is to
   further investigate the use of numerical tools to model the peen forming
   process. This work combines static and dynamic simulation techniques to
   predict the development of curvature on representative wing skin panels
   that include features such as integral stiffeners. This work illustrates
   the considerable potential of finite element simulations to determine
   the process parameters needed to produce a component design, and
   substantially reduce the dependence upon physical testing. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{This paper considers a vehicle routing problem where each vehicle
   performs delivery operations over multiple routes during its workday and
   where new customer requests occur dynamically. The proposed methodology
   for addressing the problem is based on an adaptive large neighborhood
   search heuristic, previously developed for the static version of the
   problem. In the dynamic case, multiple possible scenarios for the
   occurrence of future requests are considered to decide about the
   opportunity to include a new request into the current solution. It is
   worth noting that the real-time decision is about the acceptance of the
   new request, not about its service which can only take place in some

Abstract = {{Over the past few years, a number of key issues related to the product
   family design have been addressed, and a great deal of work has been
   done to improve it. Many different tools have been employed in this
   effort, such as mass customization, modularity, delayed differentiation,
   commonality, platforms, product families, and so on. The purpose of this
   paper is to analyze how fuzzy logic has been applied and how it can help
   to improve the entire process of product family development. Given its
   powerful capability to represent aspects that binary variables cannot,
   we show how fuzzy logic has been used to take advantage by considering
   the vague parameters related to the human character in different
   processes. Our aim is to contribute to the understanding and improvement
   of product family development process by identifying essential
   applications of fuzzy logic. An extended overview of the product family
   development process is provided, and also this work highlights the role
   of fuzzy logic in it. Fourteen fuzzy logic tools and thirteen topics
   into the product family development process are identified and
   summarized as a framework to analyze the role of fuzzy logic and at the
   same time to identify further application opportunities.}},

Abstract = {{A low-power and small silicon area digitally controlled Switched Mode
   Power Supply (SMPS) is intended for the minimization of both power and
   size of an on-chip DC power supply building block which is mainly
   dedicated for implantable medical sensing and microstimulation devices.
   Such SMPS is based on a successive divider-line analog-to-digital
   Converter (SDLADC), which is the focus of this paper. Special attention
   is paid for reducing the power consumption and silicon area of this
   SDLADC, which consists of a resistor network based on diode connected
   transistor used to replace the delay-line of the windowed ADC. To
   compensate process and temperature variations, a digital calibration
   technique is used to meet the specified static and dynamic output
   voltage regulations and avoid variations of the regulated SMPS output
   voltage. The proposed ADC is implemented in AMS 0.35 mu m CMOS process.
   Simulation results show a current consumption of 1.5 mu A/MHz and
   conversion time of 10 ns much lower than recent conventional topology
   values. The proposed circuit exhibits a quantization steps smaller than
   1.6\% of V-ref and it can be a solution for high switching frequency,
   which results on faster regulation of SMPS output voltage. Crown

Journal = {{INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{The intake fraction (iF) is the fraction of an emitted mass of chemical
   that is ultimately taken in by an entire population, and it is used as
   an indicator of human health potential impacts related to environmental
   chemical persistence and bioaccumulation in the food chain. In chemical
   screening applications, the iF can be predicted using multimedia and
   multipathway fate and exposure models. One of the sources of iF
   uncertainty is the natural seasonal variability of the input parameters
   used in the models, i.e., the physicochemical properties of the
   pollutant and the landscape and exposure parameters. The objective of
   this article is to determine the relevance of including seasonal
   differentiation when assessing iFs in life cycle assessment. This was
   done by calculating and comparing seasonal iFs with each other and with
   iFs at 25 degrees?C, for both Canadian and global contexts. Two Canadian
   seasonal models based on the IMPACT 2002 predictive tool, and 2 models
   for the global context based on the USEtox consensus model were
   developed to calculate summer and winter iFs. Emissions into air and
   water and a set of 35 representative organic chemicals were considered.
   Partition coefficients for seasonal conditions were calculated using an
   integration of the van't Hoff equation. First-order degradation rate
   constants were calculated assuming that the rate constant doubles with
   each 10 degrees?C increase in temperature. For Canadian air emissions,
   results indicated that iFs for winter emissions could be up to 1 to 2
   orders of magnitude higher than summer iFs or iFs calculated at 25
   degrees?C. For Canadian water emissions, results showed that iFs for
   both summer and winter conditions were, in general, closer to each other
   with outliers within 1 order of magnitude to iFs calculated at 25
   degrees?C. Results also indicated that seasonal variability was of
   lesser importance when assessing iFs within a global context. Because
   the ranking between chemicals was maintained, it can be concluded that
   seasonal variability is not relevant within a comparative context.
   However, this difference might be significant when comparing the
   magnitude of human toxicity impacts versus other impact categories
   contributing to human health damages. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2012;

Abstract = {{Up-to-date preservation of project knowledge like developer
   communication and design documents is essential for the successful
   evolution of software systems. Ideally, all knowledge should be
   preserved, but since projects only have limited resources, and software
   systems continuously grow in scope and complexity, one needs to
   prioritize the subsystems and development periods for which knowledge
   preservation is more urgent. For example, core subsystems on which the
   majority of other subsystems build are obviously prime candidates for
   preservation, yet if these subsystems change continuously, picking a
   development period to start knowledge preservation and to maintain
   knowledge for over time become very hard. This paper exploits the time
   dependence between code changes to automatically determine for which
   subsystems and development periods of a software project knowledge
   preservation would be most valuable. A case study on two large open
   source projects (PostgreSQL and FreeBSD) shows that the most valuable
   subsystems to preserve knowledge for are large core subsystems. However,
   the majority of these subsystems (1) are continuously foundational,
   i.e., ideally for each development period knowledge should be preserved,
   and (2) experience substantial changes, i.e., preserving knowledge
   requires substantial effort. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs)/epoxy
   nanocomposite suspensions were prepared and injected into
   three-dimensional (3D) interconnected microfluidic networks in order to
   fabricate composite beams reinforced with patterned-oriented nanotubes.
   The microfluidic networks were fabricated by the robotized direct
   deposition of fugitive ink filaments in a layer-by-layer sequence onto
   substrates, followed by their epoxy encapsulation and the ink removal.
   Then, the nanocomposite suspensions prepared by ultrasonication and
   three-roll mill mixing methods were injected into the empty networks
   under two different controlled and constant pressures in order to
   subject the suspensions to different shear conditions in the
   microchannels. Morphological studies revealed that the SWCNTs were
   preferentially aligned in the microchannels along the flow direction at
   the higher injection pressure. The improvement of Young's modulus of the
   manufactured 3D-reinforced rectangular beams prepared at the high
   injection pressure was almost doubled when compared to that of beams
   prepared at the low injection pressure. Finally, the stiffness of the
   3D-reinforced beams was compared with the theoretically predicted values
   obtained from a micromechanical model. The analytical predictions give a
   close estimation of the stiffness at different micro-injection
   conditions. Based on the experimental and theoretical results, the
   present manufacturing technique enables the spatial orientation of
   nanotube in the final product by taking advantage of shear flow combined
   with dimensional constraining inside the microfluidic channels. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Since the Kalman filter and Monte Carlo techniques, much theoretical
   work has been put into the development of signal deconvolution tools.
   Among recent developments taking place in neuroscience are Dynamic
   Expectation Maximization, Generalized Filtering and the Cubature Kalman
   Filter. While there are exciting prospects to use these tools for
   Dynamic Causal Modeling and other analyses of networks, there has been
   comparatively little work to validate the algorithms on controlled
   experimental data. In this work, the latest evolution of these tools,
   the square-root cubature Kalman smoother (SCKS), is tested for its
   effectiveness on multimodal neurovascular data. Multispectral intrinsic
   optical imaging and electrophysiological measurements of Wistar rats are
   used in combination with somatosensory stimulation. The Buxton-Friston
   (B-F) balloon model is then deconvolved with the SCKS algorithm to
   obtain the estimated neuronal inputs u(t) from the hemodynamic
   measurements (flow, oxy- and deoxygenated hemoglobin).
   Results: The estimated neuronal inputs are compared to the stimulation
   protocol and a sensitivity and specificity analysis is carried out. SCKS
   succeeds in recovering most of the stimulations. Next, the estimated
   inputs are compared to actual measures of neuronal activity: local field
   potentials (LFPs) and multiunit activity (MUA). Good sensitivity of the
   technique is obtained with both LFPs and MUA over the whole recordings,
   with the area of the ROC curves favoring LFPs. A weak correlation
   between SCKS estimated inputs and LFPs is found outside stimulation
   periods, significant at one standard deviation. Finally, the accuracy of
   state reconstructions is studied and SCKS reconstructed states are
   highly concordant with measured states. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Aqueous solutions of PEO exhibit a lower critical solution temperature
   (LCST) phase diagram. In this work, phase separation behavior of
   PEO/water solutions was investigated using small-amplitude oscillatory
   shear and steady shear rheological measurements. Binodal decomposition
   temperatures were determined from the sudden changes in the slope of the
   dynamic temperature sweep of storage modulus and loss tangent. The
   spinodal decomposition points were also estimated by a mean-field
   theoretical approach. Comparing the obtained critical points with other
   conventional methods revealed that rheological measurements are powerful
   and sensitive to detect even the early stage of phase separation of PEO
   solutions. This successful method was employed to investigate phase
   separation and miscibility of chitosan/PEO solutions at different
   compositions in aqueous acetic acid solutions that have already showed
   anomalous behavior in a forming process. Lower critical solution
   temperature (LCST) phase behavior was observed for chitosan/PEO solution
   blends. Phase separation temperature, miscibility range, and correlation
   length of the solutions were determined from isochronal dynamic
   temperature sweep experiments. The effect of chitosan/PEO ratio on the
   binodal and spinodal decomposition temperatures was studied. Finding
   phase separation information on polymer solutions through rheological
   measurement is very promising. Isothermal steady shear rheological
   measurements were also carried out on chitosan/PEO solutions over a
   temperature range in which phase separation occurs. Viscosity increase
   at low shear rates above but in the vicinity of phase separation
   temperature was observed, which confirms the validity of the theoretical
   approach employed to determine the critical temperatures through dynamic
   rheological measurements. Finally, the Flory-Huggins interaction
   parameters were estimated from critical solution temperature and
   concentration results.}},

Abstract = {{Optical, mechanical, and thermal properties of optical thin films are
   very important for a reliable device performance. In the present work,
   the effect of annealing on the stability and the characteristics of
   niobium and tantalum oxide films grown at room temperature (RT) by dual
   ion beam sputtering were studied. The refractive index (n(lambda)),
   extinction coefficient (k(lambda)), hardness (H), reduced Young's
   modulus (E-r), and film stress (sigma) were investigated as a function
   of the annealing temperature (T-A). X-ray diffraction analysis showed
   that all as-deposited films were amorphous, and crystallization was
   observed only after annealing at 700 degrees C. Compositional analyses
   confirmed that the atomic ratio of oxygen to metal in as-deposited and
   annealed films was close to 2.5, indicating that the films were
   stoichiometric pentoxides of Nb and Ta. The properties of Nb2O5 and
   Ta2O5 films were, respectively, affected by postdeposition annealing: n
   (lambda) values (at 550 nm) decreased from 2.30 to 2.20 and from 2.14 to
   2.08, the average H and E-r values increased from 5.6 to 7.4 GPa, and
   from 121 to 132 GPa for Nb2O5, and from 6.5 to 8.3 GPa, and from 132 to
   144 GPa for Ta2O5, and the initial low compressive stress for both
   materials changed to tensile. We explain the variation of the coating
   material properties in terms of film stoichiometry, crystallinity,
   electronic structure, and possible reactions at the film-substrate
   interface. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an anisotropic mesh adaptation method applied to
   industrial combustion problems. The method is based on a measure of the
   distance between two Riemannian metrics called metric non-conformity.
   This measure, which can be used to build a cost function to adapt meshes
   comprising several types of mesh elements, provides the basis for a
   generic mesh adaptation approach applicable to various types of physical
   problems governed by partial differential equations. The approach is
   shown to be applicable to industrial combustion problems, through the
   specification of a target metric computed as the intersection of several
   Hessian matrices reconstructed from the main variables of the governing
   equations. Numerical results show that the approach is cost effective in
   that it can drastically improve the prediction of temperature and
   species distributions in the flame region of a combustor while reducing
   computational cost. The results can be used as a basis for pollutant
   prediction models. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a constraint programming approach for a batch
   processing machine on which a finite number of jobs of non-identical
   sizes must be scheduled. A parallel batch processing machine can process
   several jobs simultaneously and the objective is to minimize the maximal
   lateness. The constraint programming formulation proposed relies on the
   decomposition of the problem into finding an assignment of the jobs to
   the batches, and then minimizing the lateness of the batches on a single
   machine. This formulation is enhanced by a new optimization constraint
   which is based on a relaxed problem and applies cost-based domain
   filtering techniques. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of
   cost-based domain filtering techniques. Comparisons to other exact
   approaches clearly show the benefits of the proposed approach: it can
   optimally solve problems that are one order of magnitude greater than
   those solved by a mathematical formulation or by a branch-and-price. (c)

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{112}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Nanoparticles of Fe, Co, Ni, and their alloys, with an average diameter
   of 12 nm were synthesized in liquids using a laser. Their saturation
   magnetization exhibited a Slater-Pauling-like behaviour with two main
   differences compared to that expected in bulk materials. First, the
   amplitude of the magnetization was found to be roughly 5 times smaller.
   Second, the disappearance of the ferromagnetic (FM) behaviour occurred
   at Ni instead of the expected Ni0.6Cu0.4. The behaviour can be explained
   by the presence of non-magnetic oxidized shells which reduced the
   fraction of ferromagnetic atoms and induce through strain an amorphous
   structure in the metallic core. Annealing at 500 K leads to some
   crystallization of the particles and thus to a partial recovery of the
   expected magnetization. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

   virtue of which electrons are ejected from the outer shells of the
   clusters-goes through a peak for very short (fs) pulses, whose position
   depends exclusively on the duration of the pulse while other parameters,
   such as laser fluence and cluster size, only affect its intensity. Our
   results thus establish that Coulomb explosion, an important process for
   the disintegration of materials under intense laser pulses, is almost
   entirely determined by the duration of the pulse while other
   ``experimental{''} parameters have relatively modest effects. (c) 2011

Abstract = {{Today, the use of immiscible polymer blends is ubiquitous, nevertheless
   the principal technical hurdle to developing a novel blend material
   remains the effective compatibilization of the interface. In order to be
   effective, the compatibilizer must locate at the interface of the
   phases, saturate the interface, occupy an optimal interfacial areal
   density (number of modifier molecules per unit area of interface),
   Sigma, and possess an optimal molecular weight to ensure an appropriate
   level of entanglement. This work examines these issues by considering
   the results of numerous papers published by this laboratory over the
   years. It will be shown that a general relationship exists between R-g,
   the radius of gyration or M-n, the molecular weight of the interfacial
   modifier, and Sigma of interfacial modifier at interfacial saturation
   using data from a wide range of systems. The results reported here
   indicate very little stretching of the modifier molecules at the
   interface for these systems. The obtained master curve can be used to
   generally predict the critical concentration required for interfacial
   saturation for a wide range of systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Suppression of tumour-specific T-cell functions by myeloid-derived
   suppressor cells (MDSCs) is a dominant mechanism of tumour escape. MDSCs
   express two enzymes, i.e. inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and
   arginase (ARG1), which metabolize the semi-essential amino acid
   L-arginine (L-Arg) whose bioavailability is crucial for T-cell
   proliferation and functions. Recently, we showed that glutaminolysis
   supports MDSC maturation process by ensuring the supply of intermediates
   and energy. In this work, we used an immortalized cell line derived from
   mouse MDSCs (MSC-1 cell line) to further investigate the role of
   L-glutamine (L-Gln) in the maintenance of MDSC immunosuppressive
   activity. Culturing MSC-1 cells in L-Gln-limited medium inhibited iNOS
   activity, while ARG1 was not affected. MSC-1 cells inhibited Jukat cell
   growth without any noticeable effect on their viability. The
   characterization of MSC-1 cell metabolic profile revealed that L-Gln is
   an important precursor of lactate production via the NADP(+)-dependent
   malic enzyme, which co-produces NADPH. Moreover, the TCA cycle activity
   was down-regulated in the absence of L-Gln and the cell bioenergetic
   status was deteriorated accordingly. This strongly suggests that iNOS
   activity, but not that of ARG1, is related to an enhanced central carbon
   metabolism and a high bioenergetic status. Taken altogether, our results
   suggest that the control of glutaminolysis fluxes may represent a
   valuable target for immunotherapy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The 12 May 2008 Wenchuan earthquake is the largest active tectonic event
   reported to date in Sichuan (China). We have experimentally calibrated,
   up to 800 MPa, seismic and elastic properties of 12 representative
   samples from the Longmen Shan complex in which this great earthquake
   took place and its coseismic ruptures nucleated and propagated. Most of
   the samples show little V-p or V-s anisotropy at pressures above the
   microcrack-closure pressure (P-c = 200-300 MPa), and so the variation of
   anisotropy with pressure provides important hints for the preferred
   orientation of microcracks in the nonlinear poroelastic regime below
   P-c. Geothermal and theological profiles indicate that the focal depth
   (similar to 19 km) corresponds to the base of the schizosphere, below
   which the Longmen Shan complex switches from the brittle to ductile
   behavior. The investigation reveals that the crust of the Longmen Shan
   range consists of 4 layers from the surface to the Moho: Layer 1:
   V-p<4.88 km/s (0-3 km thick, sedimentary rocks such as limestone,
   sandstone, conglomerate, and mudstone); Layer 2: V-p = 5.95-6.25 km/s
   (25-28 km thick, felsic rocks); Layer 3: V-p = 6.55 km/s (10 km thick,
   67.5\% felsic and 32.5\% mafic rocks); and Layer 4: Vp = 6.90 km/s (8 km
   thick, 20.0\% felsic and 80.0\% mafic rocks). The average V-p/V-s ratio
   of 1.71 or Poisson's ratio of 0.24 calculated for the whole crust is
   consistent with the results measured using teleseismic receiver function
   techniques. This study also offers necessary information for broadband
   simulations of strong ground motions in the assessment and forecast of
   earthquake hazards in the region. Furthermore, the study, which yields a
   moment magnitude of 7.9-8.0 given the variation in the dip of the
   coseismic ruptures and the uncertainty in the depth to which the
   coseismic rupture may propagate downwards below the depth of the
   mainshock hypocenter, presents the first accurate quantification of the
   2008 Wenchuan earthquake's size. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the onset of motion, and the subsequent
   finite-amplitude convection, in a shallow porous cavity filled with a
   non-Newtonian fluid. A power-law model is used to characterize the
   non-Newtonian fluid behavior of the saturating fluid. Constant fluxes of
   heat are imposed on the horizontal walls of the layer. The governing
   parameters of the problem under study are the Rayleigh number R, the
   power-law index n, and the aspect ratio of the cavity A. An analytical
   solution, valid for shallow enclosures (A >> 1), is derived on the basis
   of the parallel flow approximation. In the range of the governing
   parameters considered in this study, a good agreement is found between
   the analytical predictions and the numerical results obtained by solving
   the full governing equations. For dilatant fluids (n > 1), it is found
   that the onset of motion is linearly unstable, i.e., always occurs
   provided that the supercritical Rayleigh number R-C(sup) >= 0. For
   pseudoplastic fluids (n < 1), the supercritical Rayleigh number for the
   onset of motion is R-C(sup) = infinity. However, it is demonstrated, on
   the basis of the nonlinear parallel flow theory, that the onset of
   motion occurs above a subcritical Rayleigh number R-C(sub) which depends
   upon the power-law index n. For finite-amplitude convection, the heat
   and flow characteristics predicted by the analytical model are found to
   agree well with a numerical study of the full governing equations.

   We study the channel synthesis problem which, given a transducer, asks
   whether or not such sender and receiver exist and builds them if the
   answer is positive. To that effect we introduce the structural notion of
   encoding state in a transducer which is a necessary condition for the
   existence of a channel. It is not, however, a sufficient condition. In
   fact, we prove that the problem is undecidable. Nonetheless, we obtain a
   synthesis procedure when the transducer is functional. We discuss these

Abstract = {{This paper describes a new architecture that explores time-based
   signal-processing concepts for testing LC-tank radio-frequency (RF)
   oscillator circuits, and in particular, quadrature oscillators, while
   relying on low-frequency digital test equipment. The proposed system has
   two inputs that are two step-like signals with a time separation that is
   externally controlled. The output of the system is an amplified and
   digitized time separation that is a function of the time separation
   between the applied input steps and the oscillator output frequency
   characteristics. Coarse time digitization circuits are used to read the
   output, from which the frequency of oscillation of the oscillator is
   deduced. A proof-of-concept circuit is designed and fabricated in a
   standard 0.18-mu m CMOS process. Experimental results confirm the
   feasibility of the proposed approach, which is demonstrated in this work

Abstract = {{Due to their great ability to parallelize at a very high integration
   level, Multi-Processors Systems-on-Chip (MPSoCs) are good candidates for
   systems and applications such as multimedia. Memory is becoming a key
   player for significant improvements in these applications (power,
   performance and area). The large amount of data manipulated by these
   applications requires high-capacity computing and memory. Lately, new
   programming models have been introduced. This leads to the need of new
   optimization and mapping techniques suitable for embedded systems and
   their programming models. This article presents novel approaches for
   combining memory optimization with mapping of data-driven applications
   while considering anti-dependence conflicts. Two different approaches
   are studied and integrated with existing mapping algorithms. The first
   approach (based on heuristic algorithms) keeps the graph transformation
   for memory optimization stage from the mapping stage and enables their
   combination in a design flow. The second approach (based on evolutionary
   algorithms) combines these two stages and integrates them in a unique
   stage. Some significant improvements are obtained for memory gain,
   communication load and physical links.}},

Abstract = {{Critical evaluation, thermodynamic modeling and optimization of the CuO
   and Cu-O-S systems are presented. The liquid phase over the whole
   composition range from metallic liquid to sulfide melt to oxide melt is
   described by a single model developed within the framework of the
   quasichemical formalism. The model reflects the existence of strong
   short-range ordering in oxide, sulfide and oxysulfide liquid. Two ranges
   of maximum short-range ordering in the CuO system at approximately the
   Cu2O and CuO compositions are taken into account. Parameters of
   thermodynamic models are optimized to reproduce all available
   thermodynamic and phase equilibrium data within experimental error
   limits. The optimization of the CuO and Cu-O-S systems performed in the
   present study is of particular importance for the description of the
   solubility of oxygen in matte and liquid copper. The obtained
   self-consistent set of model parameters can be used as a basis for
   development of a thermodynamic database for simulation of copper

   account, is used for the liquid phase, and the Compound Energy Formalism
   is used for the solid solutions. Optimized model parameters have been
   obtained for the Gibbs energy functions of all stable phases, and the

   that the Modified Quasichemical Model used for the liquid alloys permits

Volume = {{35}},

Pages = {{752-761}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A slug test yielding an oscillating water level response is called
   ``underdamped.{''} Usually, test data are fitted visually to theoretical
   solutions. Considering that visual fits are user dependent, this paper
   provides two best fit user independent methods for analyzing test data.
   It provides also a velocity graph method that can be used to select only
   those data that are not influenced by initial dynamic effects such as
   splashing. Several examples are provided, with emphasis on the utility
   of the three checks required by ASTM D5785. It is shown that the
   selected value of the soil modulus or its storativity S does not
   interfere with the fitting process but does influence the derived k
   value by about +/- 30\% (the lower the selected S value, the higher the
   resulting k value). If the elastic S value is confused with a specific
   yield, the interpretation results do not pass the three checks of ASTM
   D5785, and, as shown by an example of a few hundred tests, they might
   yield k values that are wrong by about 300\%, with serious consequences
   for estimates of groundwater velocity and the fate of contaminants.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the design of multiway power dividers by interconnecting
   power dividers with fewer output ports is studied by transforming them
   into multisection stepped-impedance transformers. By using this
   approach, it is easy to design multiway power dividers with required
   equal ripples of input reflection (S11) within a wide passband. The
   interconnecting lines can be used as additional matching sections to
   improve the input matching. General properties of this type of multiway
   power dividers can be easily obtained. Design of multiway power divider
   with required input reflection level can be readily performed by using
   the published data and tables of stepped-impedance transformer in the
   literature. Both even- and odd-mode analyses are performed to obtain the
   optimal isolation resistor values. A prototype of a wideband four-way
   power divider with a rhombic architecture is designed, fabricated, and
   measured. Simulation and measurement results are in good agreement and
   validate the proposed approach.}},

Volume = {{42}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a comparison between eight different methods for
   determining risk factors for work-related musculoskeletal disorders. The
   Quick Exposure Check (QEC), the Ergonomic Workplace Analysis developed
   by the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health (FIOH), ACGIH's Hand
   Activity Level threshold limit values method (HAL), the Job Strain Index
   (JSI), the OCRA index, the EN 1005-3 standard, the Rapid Upper Limb
   Assessment (RULA) and the Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) methods
   were all used to assess 224 workstations involving 567 tasks in various
   industrial sectors. The results are compared using three risk categories
   (low, moderate, high). Data were gathered using video and measurements
   taken at the workstations. A questionnaire was also administered to
   employees participating in the study. The findings reveal that the
   various methods differ in their analyses of the same workstation. The EN
   1005-3 standard assessing risk to the shoulder was the most
   conservative, identifying over 86\% of the workstations as high risk.
   The HAL classified 37\% of the workstations as low-risk to the hand and
   wrist compare to JSI with 9\%. Correlation was highest between RULA and
   REBA, and between JSI and HAL The FIOH, RULA and REBA methods did not
   identify any workstations as low risk. The QEC method proved to be the
   less stringent in assessing overall risk, classifying 35\% of the
   workstations as high risk compare to RULA with 76\%. The QEC Hand/wrist
   and OCRA Hand/wrist/elbow indices showed similar results for the number
   of workstations classified as high risk, but did not classify the same
   workstations in this category. OCRA and QEC were in agreement 57\% of
   the time for all risk categories combined.
   Relevance to industry: These results provide a better understanding of
   the differences between various risk assessment methods. This
   information should be particularly useful for practitioners when
   choosing a method prior to an ergonomic intervention in industry. (C)

Abstract = {{The use of hollow-fiber membrane bioreactors (HFMBs) has been proposed
   for three-dimensional bone tissue growth at the clinical scale. However,
   to achieve an efficient HFMB design, the relationship between cell
   growth and environmental conditions must be determined. Therefore, in
   this work, a dynamic double-porous media model was developed to
   determine nutrient-dependent cell growth for bone tissue formation in a
   HFMB. The whole hollow-fiber scaffold within the bioreactor was treated
   as a porous domain in this model. The domain consisted of two
   interpenetrating porous regions, including a porous lumen region
   available for fluid flow and a porous extracapillary space filled with a
   collagen gel that contained adherent cells for promoting long-term
   growth into tissue-like mass. The governing equations were solved
   numerically and the model was validated using previously published
   experimental results. The contributions of several bioreactor design and
   process parameters to the performance of the bioreactor were studied.
   The results demonstrated that the process and design parameters of the
   HFMB significantly affect nutrient transport and thus cell behavior over
   a long period of culture. The approach presented here can be applied to
   any cell type and used to develop tissue engineering hollow-fiber
   scaffolds.}},

Abstract = {{In this work a new generation of bioceramic personalized implants were
   developed. This technique combines the processes of solid freeform
   fabrication (SFF) and combustion synthesis (CS) to create personalized
   bioceramic implants with tricalcium phosphate (TCP) and hydroxyapatite
   (HA). These porous bioceramics will be used to fill the tibial bone gap
   created by the opening wedge high tibial osteotomy (OWHTO). A freeform
   fabrication with three-dimensional printing (3DP) technique was used to
   fabricate a metallic mold with the same shape required to fill the gap
   in the opening wedge osteotomy. The mold was subsequently used in a CS
   process to fabricate the personalized ceramic implants with TCP and HA
   compositions. The mold geometry was designed on commercial 3D CAD
   software. The final personalized bioceramic implant was produced using a
   CS process. This technique was chosen because it exploits the exothermic
   reaction between P2O5 and CaO. Also, chemical composition and
   distribution of pores in the implant could be controlled. To determine
   the chemical composition, the microstructure, and the mechanical
   properties of the implant, cylindrical shapes were also fabricated using
   different fabrication parameters. Chemical composition was performed by
   X-ray diffraction. Pore size and pore interconnectivity was measured and
   analyzed using an electronic microscope system. Mechanical properties
   were determined by a mechanical testing system. The porous TCP and HA
   obtained have an open porous structure with an average 400 mu m channel
   size. The mechanical behavior shows great stiffness and higher load to
   failure for both ceramics. Finally, this personalized ceramic implant
   facilitated the regeneration of new bone in the gap created by OWHTO and
   provides additional strength to allow accelerated rehabilitation.}},

Abstract = {{The generation of nanobubbles around plasmonic nanostructures is an
   efficient approach for imaging and therapy, especially in the field of
   cancer research. We show a novel method using infrared femtosecond laser
   that generates approximate to 800 nm bubbles around off-resonance gold
   nanospheres using 200 mJ/cm(2) 45 fs pulses. We present experimental and
   theoretical work that demonstrate that the nanobubble formation results
   from the generation of a nanoscale plasma around the particle due to the
   enhanced near-field rather than from the heating of the particle. Energy
   absorbed in the nanoplasma is indeed more than 11 times the energy
   absorbed in the particle. When compared to the usual approach that uses
   nanosecond laser to induce the extreme heating of in-resonance
   nanoparticles to initiate bubble formation, our off-resonance
   femtosecond technique is shown to bring many advantages, including
   avoiding the particles fragmentation, working in the optical window of
   biological material and using the deposited energy more efficiently.}},

   Intermig (R) impellers under the same specific power draw. It is shown
   that these open impellers induce complex local flows in the radial and

   contrast, the Maxblend impeller generates a more regular circulation
   pattern, with efficient top-to-bottom pumping. (c) 2012 The Institution

Abstract = {{Despite an increase in the number of experimental and numerical studies
   dedicated to spinal trauma, the influence of the rate of loading or
   displacement on lumbar spine injuries remains unclear. In the present
   work, we developed a bio-realistic finite element model (FEM) of the
   lumbar spine using a comprehensive geometrical representation of spinal
   components and material laws that include strain rate dependency, bone
   fracture, and ligament failure. The FEM was validated against published
   experimental data and used to compare the initiation sites of spinal
   injuries under low (LD) and high (HD) dynamic compression, flexion,
   extension, anterior shear, and posterior shear. Simulations resulted in
   force-displacement and moment-angular rotation curves well within
   experimental corridors, with the exception of LD flexion where angular
   stiffness was higher than experimental values. Such a discrepancy is
   attributed to the initial toe-region of the ligaments not being included
   in the material law used in the study. Spinal injuries were observed at
   different initiation sites under LD and HD loading conditions, except
   under shear loads. These findings suggest that the strain rate dependent
   behavior of spinal components plays a significant role in load-sharing
   and failure mechanisms of the spine under different loading conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents and demonstrates a class of 3-D integration
   platforms of substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW). The proposed right
   angle E-plane corner based on SIW technology enables the implementation
   of various 3-D architectures of planar circuits with the printed circuit
   board and other similar processes. This design scheme brings up
   attractive advantages in terms of cost, flexibility, and integration.
   Two circuit prototypes with both 0- and 45 degrees vertical rotated arms
   are demonstrated. The straight version of the prototypes shows 0.5 dB of
   insertion loss from 30 to 40 GHz, while the rotated version gives 0.7 dB
   over the same frequency range. With this H-to-E-plane interconnect, a
   T-junction is studied and designed. Simulated results show 20-dB return
   loss over 19.25\% of bandwidth. Measured results suggest an excellent
   performance within the experimental frequency range of 32-37.4 GHz, with
   10-dB return loss and less than +/-4 degrees phase imbalance. An
   optimized wideband magic-T structure is demonstrated and fabricated.
   Both simulated and measured results show a very promising performance
   with very good isolation and power equality. With two 45 degrees
   vertical rotated arm bends, two antennas are used to build up a dual
   polarization system. An isolation of 20 dB is shown over 32-40 GHz and
   the radiation patterns of the antenna are also given.}},

   as its feeder. Transverse slot on the top metallic surface at the end of
   SIW is deployed to drive the horn antenna. Metalized via holes are used
   to synthesize the horn walls. The opening of the horn antenna is
   discretely flared from the bottom to the top layer. Measured bandwidth

Abstract = {{The study of the capillary flow developed during the processing of
   composite materials is key because it acts as an important driving force
   for the impregnation of the fiber tows. It is also the main mechanism of
   void formation during infiltration of the fibers. In this work,
   capillary pressure of jute/vinylester composites was measured and the
   impact of capillary forces on fabric permeability was analyzed. It was
   found that the capillary pressure was significantly higher in vegetal
   than in synthetic fiber fabrics. In addition, the permeability of the
   fibers was characterized using various fluids. The resulting
   permeability was influenced by the nature of fluid and its polar
   property. Finally, the capillary pressure measured by this work was used
   to correct the experimental permeability in order to obtain a property
   independent of the test fluid. POLYM. COMPOS., 2012. (c) 2012 Society of

   Reaction rates may be maintained for longer times by co-feeding low

   yield drops proportionally to the oxygen concentration. The catalyst is
   easily regenerated by air and the reaction rate is proportional to both
   the oxygen concentration and quantity of carbon. The carbonaceous
   deposits may be due to both glycerol and acrolein: when either is fed to
   the catalyst, the CO2/CO ratio is close to 1; during the regeneration
   step, the CO2/CO ratio is near 4. A kinetic model of first order in both

Abstract = {{Life cycle assessment (LCA) is recognized as a powerful method to
   evaluate the environmental impacts of a product. However, its use in
   product development processes remains marginal. While authors have
   advanced different technical solutions to facilitate or accelerate the
   conduct of an LCA, current methods are generally still not adapted to
   designers, who often lack the time and expertise to make use of LCA
   results in their day-to-day activities. This paper addresses the issue
   by proposing a Business Process Reengineering (BPR) methodology that can
   be used to develop suitable Decision-Support Systems (DSS). These
   systems would enhance the use of LCA results in early design phases. The
   development of such a tool in a particular case study illustrates how
   its development is aligned with the current designer expectations and
   constraints. The case study is built on the results of a previous LCA of
   a known strategic product and includes a library with existing newly
   characterized materials and components, making it possible to evaluate
   several design alternatives from an environmental and cost perspective,
   using LCA as a predictive tool rather than a retrospective one. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{A new experimental approach is proposed to investigate the gas-solid
   structure in the vicinity of a sparger nozzle in a fluidized bed. The
   approach consists in performing an injection velocity sweep with a
   fiber-optic probe located at a fixed distance downstream the sparger
   nozzle. Following this approach, the local gas-solid structure was
   investigated for different nozzle orientations (downward, horizontal and
   upward) and measurement distances. For a given fluidized media (FCC
   catalyst, Geldart A) and superficial gas velocity (0.9 m/s), the local
   gas-solid structure depended upon the measurement distance, sparger
   nozzle orientation and injection velocity. Four distinct impact zones
   were identified from the average local solid holdup, with the boundaries
   corresponding to the characteristic jet lengths (L-min, L-max and L-b).
   Locally, the major hydrodynamic parameters of the gas-solid structure
   (e.g. average holdup, phase holdup, phase fraction, and phase
   change-over frequency) showed nearly linear dependence with the
   injection velocity, allowing for an easy estimation of the gas-solid
   structure. Dynamic aspects of the gas-solid structure were investigated.
   A simple analysis suggests that the frequency of the pulsating jet
   (between L-min and L-max) was in the order of 1 and 1.5 Hz. Comparison
   of the collected data with existing correlations indicated that none of
   the correlations are capable of adequately predicting the penetration
   lengths, under the present test conditions. This is especially true for
   the upward and horizontal sparger nozzles, for which correlations have
   mostly been developed using Geldart B and D particles and operated at
   superficial velocities at or near the minimum fluidization velocity. (C)

Title = {{Sensitivity analysis of some critical factors affecting simulated

Abstract = {{Intrusion events caused by transient low pressures may result in the
   contamination of a water distribution system (DS). This work aims at
   estimating the range of potential intrusion volumes that could result
   from a real downsurge event caused by a momentary pump shutdown. A model
   calibrated with transient low pressure recordings was used to simulate
   total intrusion volumes through leakage orifices and submerged air
   vacuum valves (AVVs). Four critical factors influencing intrusion
   volumes were varied: the external head of (untreated) water on leakage
   orifices, the external head of (untreated) water on submerged air vacuum
   valves, the leakage rate, and the diameter of AVVs' outlet orifice
   (represented by a multiplicative factor). Leakage orifices' head and
   AVVs' orifice head levels were assessed through fieldwork. Two sets of
   runs were generated as part of two statistically designed experiments. A
   first set of 81 runs was based on a complete factorial design in which
   each factor was varied over 3 levels. A second set of 40 runs was based
   on a latin hypercube design, better suited for experimental runs on a
   computer model. The simulations were conducted using commercially
   available transient analysis software. Responses, measured by total
   intrusion volumes, ranged from 10 to 366 L. A second degree polynomial
   was used to analyze the total intrusion volumes. Sensitivity analyses of
   both designs revealed that the relationship between the total intrusion
   volume and the four contributing factors is not monotonic, with the
   AVVs' orifice head being the most influential factor. When intrusion
   through both pathways occurs concurrently, interactions between the
   intrusion flows through leakage orifices and submerged AVVs influence
   intrusion volumes. When only intrusion through leakage orifices is
   considered, the total intrusion volume is more largely influenced by the
   leakage rate than by the leakage orifices' head. The latter mainly
   impacts the extent of the area affected by intrusion. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A pilot experiment examined lead leaching from four representative
   configurations of service lines including: (1) 100\% lead (Pb), (2)
   100\% copper (Cu), (3) 50\% Pb upstream of 50\% Cu, and (4) 50\%
   Pb-downstream of 50\% Cu using a range of flow rates. The cumulative
   mass of lead release indicated that a typical partial replacement
   configuration (50\% lead downstream of copper) did not provide a net
   reduction in lead when compared to 100\% lead pipe (85 mg for 50\%
   Pb-downstream versus 83 mg for 100\%-Pb) due to galvanic and deposition
   corrosion. The partially replaced service line configuration also had a
   much greater likelihood of producing water with ``spikes{''} of lead
   particulates at higher flow rates, while tending to produce lower levels
   of lead at very low flow rates. After the first 214 days the galvanic
   current between copper and lead was only reduced by 34\%, proving that
   galvanic impacts can be highly persistent even in water with optimized
   corrosion control by dosing of zinc orthophosphate. Finally, this
   experiment raises concern about the low flow rates used during some
   prior home sampling events, which may underestimate exposure to lead
   during normal water use, especially when galvanic Pb:Cu connections are
   present. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Net-zero energy buildings (NZEBs) are expected to play an important role
   in fighting climate change and reducing the energy use of the built
   environment. But even if the best design practices are widely adopted
   and implemented, this will only mitigate global warming. It is too late
   to prevent it. Yet buildings - including net-zero energy buildings - are
   often designed using historical data representing the average climate
   between 1961 and 1990, or between 1976 and 2005 at best.
   This paper investigates the use of the downscaling method known as
   ``morphing{''}, proposed by Belcher et al. (2005), to generate weather
   data files. The impact of using these weather files on the energy
   performance of an actual NZEB is then assessed. Morphing is applied to
   typical ``horizon years{''} representative of future climate and also on
   a month-by-month and year-by-year basis using raw data from a selected
   GCM. A 50-year series of hourly weather data is obtained and analyzed
   for two different locations, Montreal (QC) and Massena (NY). The data
   are then used to simulate the performance of a net-zero energy home as
   it was designed using historical data. The results show that the
   building misses the net-zero energy target for most years. The
   year-to-year variability of the total energy use is relatively small but
   the impact on the energy excess or shortage in relation to the net-zero
   target is significant. climate-sensitive buildings such as NZEBs should
   always be designed using multi-year simulations with weather data that
   take climate change into account. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Until recently, the lack of ground truth data has hindered the
   application of discriminative structured prediction techniques to the
   stereo problem. In this paper we use ground truth data sets that we have
   recently constructed to explore different model structures and parameter
   learning techniques. To estimate parameters in Markov random fields
   (MRFs) via maximum likelihood one usually needs to perform approximate
   probabilistic inference. Conditional random fields (CRFs) are
   discriminative versions of traditional MRFs. We explore a number of
   novel CRF model structures including a CRF for stereo matching with an
   explicit occlusion model. CRFs require expensive inference steps for
   each iteration of optimization and inference is particularly slow when
   there are many discrete states. We explore belief propagation,
   variational message passing and graph cuts as inference methods during
   learning and compare with learning via pseudolikelihood. To accelerate
   approximate inference we have developed a new method called sparse
   variational message passing which can reduce inference time by an order
   of magnitude with negligible loss in quality. Learning using sparse
   variational message passing improves upon previous approaches using
   graph cuts and allows efficient learning over large data sets when
   energy functions violate the constraints imposed by graph cuts.}},

Abstract = {{More stringent regulations on drinking water quality as well as an
   increased focus on emerging contaminants has favored the development of
   alternative technologies to the conventional process (clarification +
   filtration + chlorination). Over the last decade, low-pressure membrane
   filtration coupled with activated carbon has been emerging as a
   promising solution, often termed as the Hybrid Membrane Process.
   Combining activated carbon with membanes presents numerous challenges
   including membrane abrasion, membrane fouling, optimization of operating
   conditions, prediction of process performances and selection of the
   process configuration. This paper presents a review of the current
   knowledge concerning the use of the Hybrid Membrane Process, applied
   either under a biological or an adsorption mode, in view to produce
   drinking water. The paper reviews the alternative process layouts and
   discuss their expected performances with respect to water quality and

Abstract = {{A finite element model is developed to predict the penetration
   time-history of three different solutes into the human lumbar disc
   following intravenous injection. Antibiotics are routinely administered
   intravenously in spinal surgery to prevent disc infection. Successful
   prophylaxis requires antibiotics to reach adequate inhibitory levels.
   Here, the transient diffusion of cephazolin is investigated over 10 h
   post-injection in a human disc model subject to reported concentrations
   in the blood stream as the prescribed boundary sources. Post-injection
   variation of cephazolin concentrations in the disc adjacent to supply
   sources closely followed the decay curve in the blood stream and fell
   sharply with time. Much lower concentrations were computed in the inner
   annulus and nucleus; much of the disc (80\% at 1 h and 49\% at 4 h)
   experienced concentrations below required inhibitory level of 1 mg/L in
   agreement with measurements. Changes in endplate permeability, disc
   size, and solute molecular weight had profound effects on concentration
   profiles at all times and regions, especially in the disc centre,
   demonstrating their crucial roles on the adequate delivery of drugs.
   Larger solutes markedly slow transport into the disc. The failure to
   reach critical therapeutic levels in the central disc regions,
   especially when endplates calcify and in larger discs, raises concerns
   and calls for caution in attempts to extrapolate findings of studies on
   animals with much smaller and non degenerate discs to the human discs.
   The current study also demonstrates the capability of computational
   models in predicting the transport of intravenously injected solutes
   into the disc. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a method to generate phase-locked pulses in the picosecond

   multiple Stokes peaks in a cavity, which directly leads to pulsing
   without the need to add a mode-locking component. This generates highly
   coherent pulses in the order of similar to 10 ps. The repetition
   frequency, which is very stable is in the order of tens of GHz, is based
   on the SBS frequency shift and has a linear dependence with temperature
   (1 MHz/degrees C). Such a laser could therefore be used in high-speed
   optical clocks and optical communication system. This system allows the
   pulses to be generated at any wavelength by simply changing the pump

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2149-2156}},
Month = {{AUG 9}},
Abstract = {{Using a validated finite element model of the intact knee joint we aim
   to compute muscle forces and joint response in the stance phase of gait.
   The model is driven by reported in vivo kinematics-kinetics data and
   ground reaction forces in asymptomatic subjects. Cartilage layers and
   menisci are simulated as depth-dependent tissues with collagen fibril
   networks. A simplified model with less refined mesh and isotropic
   depth-independent cartilage is also considered to investigate the effect
   of model accuracy on results. Muscle forces and joint detailed response
   are computed following an iterative procedure yielding results that
   satisfy kinematics/kinetics constraints while accounting at deformed
   configurations for muscle forces and passive properties. Predictions
   confirm that muscle forces and joint response alter substantially during
   the stance phase and that a simplified joint model may accurately be
   used to estimate muscle forces but not necessarily contact forces/areas,
   tissue stresses/strains, and ligament forces. Predictions are in general
   agreement with results of earlier studies. Performing the analyses at 6
   periods from beginning to the end (0\%, 5\%, 25\%, 50\%, 75\% and
   100\%), hamstrings forces peaked at 5\%, quadriceps forces at 25\%
   whereas gastrocnemius forces at 75\%. ACL Force reached its maximum of
   343 N at 25\% and decreased thereafter. Contact forces reached maximum
   at 5\%, 25\% and 75\% periods with the medial compartment carrying a
   major portion of load and experiencing larger relative movements and
   cartilage strains. Much smaller contact stresses were computed at the
   patellofemoral joint. This novel iterative kinematics-driven model is
   promising for the joint analysis in altered conditions. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) approach
   to derive spatially explicit soil sensitivity indicators for terrestrial
   acidification. This global approach is compatible with a subsequent
   damage assessment, making it possible to consistently link the developed
   midpoint indicators with a later endpoint assessment along the
   cause-effect chain-a prerequisite in LCIA. Four different soil chemical
   indicators were preselected to evaluate sensitivity factors (SFs) for
   regional receiving environments at the global scale, namely the base
   cations to aluminum ratio, aluminum to calcium ratio, pH, and aluminum
   concentration. These chemical indicators were assessed using the PROFILE
   geochemical steady-state soil model and a global data set of regional
   soil parameters developed specifically for this study. Results showed
   that the most sensitive regions (i.e., where SF is maximized) are in
   Canada, northern Europe, the Amazon, central Africa, and East and
   Southeast Asia. However, the approach is not bereft of uncertainty.
   Indeed, a Monte Carlo analysis showed that input parameter variability
   may induce SF variations of up to over 6 orders of magnitude for certain
   chemical indicators. These findings improve current practices and enable
   the development of regional characterization models to assess regional
   life cycle inventories in a global economy.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, numerous hydrogels are under examination as potential nucleus
   replacements. The clinical success, however, depends on how well the
   mechanical function of the host structure is restored. This study aimed
   to evaluate the extent to and mechanisms by which surgery for nucleus
   replacements influence the mechanical behaviour of the disc. The effects
   of an annulus defect with and without nucleus replacement on disc height
   and nucleus pressure were measured using 24 ovine motion segments. The
   following cases were considered: intact; annulus incision repaired by
   suture and glue; annulus incision with removal and re-implantation of
   nucleus tissue repaired by suture and glue or plug. To identify the
   likely mechanisms observed in vitro, a finite-element model of a human
   disc (L4-L5) was employed. Both studies were subjected to physiological
   cycles of compression and recovery. A repaired annulus defect did not
   influence the disc behaviour in vitro, whereas additional nucleus
   removal and replacement substantially decreased disc stiffness and
   nucleus pressure. Model predictions demonstrated the substantial effects
   of reductions in replaced nucleus water content, bulk modulus and
   osmotic potential on disc height loss and pressure, similar to
   measurements. In these events, the compression load transfer in the disc
   markedly altered by substantially increasing the load on the annulus
   when compared with the nucleus. The success of hydrogels for nucleus
   replacements is not only dependent on the implant material itself but
   also on the restoration of the environment perturbed during surgery. The
   substantial effects on the disc response of disruptions owing to nucleus
   replacements can be simulated by reduced nucleus water content, elastic
   modulus and osmotic potential.}},

Title = {{Quantitative evaluation of an automatic segmentation method for 3D
   reconstruction of intervertebral scoliotic disks from MR images}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL IMAGING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{AUG 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: For some scoliotic patients the spinal instrumentation is
   inevitable. Among these patients, those with stiff curvature will need
   thoracoscopic disk resection. The removal of the intervertebral disk
   with only thoracoscopic images is a tedious and challenging task for the
   surgeon. With computer aided surgery and 3D visualisation of the
   interverterbral disk during surgery, surgeons will have access to
   additional information such as the remaining disk tissue or the distance
   of surgical tools from critical anatomical structures like the aorta or
   spinal canal. We hypothesized that automatically extracting 3D
   information of the intervertebral disk from MR images would aid the
   surgeons to evaluate the remaining disk and would add a security factor
   to the patient during thoracoscopic disk resection.
   Methods: This paper presents a quantitative evaluation of an automatic
   segmentation method for 3D reconstruction of intervertebral scoliotic
   disks from MR images. The automatic segmentation method is based on the
   watershed technique and morphological operators. The 3D Dice Similarity
   Coefficient (DSC) is the main statistical metric used to validate the
   automatically detected preoperative disk volumes. The automatic
   detections of intervertebral disks of real clinical MR images are
   compared to manual segmentation done by clinicians.
   Results: Results show that depending on the type of MR acquisition
   sequence, the 3D DSC can be as high as 0.79 (+/- 0.04). These 3D results
   are also supported by a 2D quantitative evaluation as well as by
   robustness and variability evaluations. The mean discrepancy (in 2D)
   between the manual and automatic segmentations for regions around the
   spinal canal is of 1.8 (+/- 0.8) mm. The robustness study shows that
   among the five factors evaluated, only the type of MRI acquisition
   sequence can affect the segmentation results. Finally, the variability
   of the automatic segmentation method is lower than the variability
   associated with manual segmentation performed by different physicians.
   Conclusions: This comprehensive evaluation of the automatic segmentation
   and 3D reconstruction of intervertebral disks shows that the proposed
   technique used with specific MRI acquisition protocol can detect
   intervertebral disk of scoliotic patient. The newly developed technique
   is promising for clinical context and can eventually help surgeons
   during thoracoscopic intervertebral disk resection.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a methodology that uses advanced nonlinear
   finite-element analysis for determining a global resistance factor for
   the design of reinforced concrete structures. It introduces a new
   reliability approach that takes into account the uncertainties of the
   material properties and the performance of the concrete model used in
   the calculations. In the proposed approach, the global resistance factor
   is computed following a procedure in which the coefficient of variation
   of the calculated resistance is estimated using Rosenblueth's
   point-estimate method. The robustness and simplicity of the method are
   demonstrated through validation examples. It is seen that good
   approximations of the resistance factor can be achieved for the case of
   normal or quasi-normal distributions of the resistance. Estimation of
   the coefficient of variation of the prediction error is then performed
   for a given reinforced concrete element and a nonlinear finite-element
   package. The accuracy of the selected software is considered through its
   ability to predict the behavior of a set of benchmarks selected for the
   target design structure, going from the material level to the structural
   level. The suggested methodology is well suited for structural engineers
   having access to nonlinear deterministic finite-element packages with
   concrete models. It proposes a reliability format that focuses on the
   variability on the resistance side while using the concept of critical
   load paths on the load side, which is compatible with the philosophy of
   the existing design codes. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0000538. (C)

Abstract = {{The evaluation and process risk assessment of (a) lignin precipitation
   from black liquor, and (b) the near-neutral hemicellulose pre-extraction
   for recovery boiler debottlenecking in an existing pulp mill is
   presented in Part I of this paper, which was published in the July 2012
   issue of TAPPI Journal. In Part II, the economic assessment of the two
   biorefinery process options is presented and interpreted. A mill process
   model was developed using WinGEMS software and used for calculating the
   mass and energy balances. Investment costs, operating costs, and
   profitability of the two biorefinery options have been calculated using
   standard cost estimation methods. The results show that the two
   biorefinery options are profitable for the case study mill and effective
   at process debottlenecking. The after-tax internal rate of return (IRR)
   of the lignin precipitation process option was estimated to be 95\%,
   while that of the hemicellulose pre-extraction process option was 28\%.
   Sensitivity analysis showed that the after tax-IRR of the lignin
   precipitation process remains higher than that of the hemicellulose
   pre-extraction process option, for all changes in the selected
   sensitivity parameters.
   If we consider the after-tax IRR, as well as capital cost, as selection
   criteria, the results show that for the case study mill, the lignin
   precipitation process is more promising than the near-neutral
   hemicellulose pre-extraction process. However, the comparison between
   the two biorefinery options should include long-term evaluation
   criteria. The potential of high value-added products that could be
   produced from lignin in the case of the lignin precipitation process, or
   from ethanol and acetic acid in the case of the hemicellulose
   pre-extraction process, should also be considered in the selection of
   the most promising process option.}},

Abstract = {{Oxidation of sulphide mining waste can generate acid mine drainage (AMD)
   that has the potential to seriously affect the ecosystems. Acid mine
   drainage is characterised by a high acidity, high concentrations of
   sulphates and metals. To reduce the environmental impacts due to AMD,
   neutralisation using limestone drains is an option proposed in the
   literature and used around the world. The present study focuses on the
   influence of the carbonate rock mineralogy and their particle size on
   the neutralising capacity. The tests were performed in two different
   anoxic conditions: in batch reactors, and in columns having a hydraulic
   retention time of 15 h. The results showed that the neutralisation
   capacity of calcite was more important than for dolomitic rock, and
   smaller particle size gave higher alkalinity production (fine calcite
   dissolved faster in contact with AMD). A characterization of metal
   precipitate in sludge and in limestone coating was performed and
   demonstrated that gypsum, lepidocrocite and goethite were the
   predominant secondary minerals to be formed. Finally, this study
   underlines that anoxic limestone drain cannot be used alone to treat
   high iron concentrated AMD.}},

Abstract = {{In the pickup and delivery problem (PDP) a fleet of vehicles must serve

   problem consists in obtaining a solution (a set of routes) that includes
   those partial routes. We have analyzed the complexity of determining
   whether or not a feasible solution exists for this problem as well as
   for some relaxations of it. Checking the feasibility of the PDP-FPR and
   some of its relaxations is shown to be NP-complete, whereas for other
   relaxations, the problem was proved to be polynomial-time solvable.}},

Abstract = {{Recent needs to superfinished surfaces have motivated researchers to

   pole and the workpiece, number of cycles, and the weight of the abrasive
   particles on aluminum surface finishing. Three-level full factorial
   method was used as design of experiments technique to study the selected
   factors. A total of 54 designed tests were done on aluminum sheet using
   an innovative material removal mechanism. Analysis of variance was used
   to determine significant factors and also to obtain an equation based on

Abstract = {{We show that chalcogenide glass As38Se62 capillaries can act as

   technique. This technique allows to produce glass capillaries with wall
   thicknesses in the range of 12 to 130 mu m. Such capillaries show
   low-loss guidance in the whole mid-IR-THz spectral range. We demonstrate
   experimentally that low-loss guidance with thin capillaries involves
   various guidance mechanisms, including Fresnel reflections at the
   capillary inner walls, resonant guidance (ARROW type) due to light
   interference in the thin capillary walls, as well as total internal
   reflection guidance where very thin capillary walls act as a
   subwavelength waveguide, which is especially easy to observe in the THz
   spectral range. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines and assesses predictive methods for the saturated
   hydraulic conductivity of soils. The soil definition is that of
   engineering. It is not that of soil science and agriculture, which
   corresponds to ``top soil{''} in engineering. Most predictive methods
   were calibrated using laboratory permeability tests performed on either
   disturbed or intact specimens for which the test conditions were either
   measured or supposed to be known. The quality of predictive equations
   depends highly on the test quality. Without examining all the quality
   issues, the paper explains the 14 most important mistakes for tests in
   rigid-wall or flexible-wall permeameters. Then, it briefly presents 45
   predictive methods, and in detail, those with some potential, such as
   the Kozeny-Carman equation. Afterwards, the data of hundreds of
   excellent quality tests, with none of the 14 mistakes, are used to
   assess the predictive methods with a potential. The relative performance
   of those methods is evaluated and presented in graphs. Three methods are
   found to work fairly well for non-plastic soils, two for plastic soils
   without fissures, and one for compacted plastic soils used for liners
   and covers. The paper discusses the effects of temperature and intrinsic
   anisotropy within the specimen, but not larger scale anisotropy within
   aquifers and aquitards.}},

Abstract = {{An exact closed-form synthesis method is proposed for the design of
   narrowband reflection-type (mono-port) phasers with arbitrary prescribed
   group-delay responses. The proposed synthesis technique consists in
   three steps. First, it transforms the phase problem from the bandpass
   domain to the low-pass domain using a one-port ladder network, where a
   mathematical synthesis is performed via a Hurwitz polynomial. Second, it
   transforms the synthesized low-pass network back to the bandpass domain
   for implementation in a specific technology. Third, it uses an iterative
   post-distortion correction technique to compensate for distributed
   effects over the broader bandwidth required. The proposed synthesis
   method is verified by both full-wave analysis and experiment where the
   synthesized bandpass network is realized in an iris-coupled waveguide
   configuration.}},

Abstract = {{A new temperature compensation method is proposed and demonstrated in
   this paper for cavities and filters realized in substrate integrated
   waveguide (SIW). The SIW structures largely preserve the well-known
   advantages of conventional rectangular waveguide, namely, high Q and
   high power capacity, and have the advantages of microstrip lines, such
   as low profile, small volume, and light weight. In this paper, we
   demonstrate that by an adequate selection of substrate properties, SIW
   cavities can provide self-temperature drift compensation. The
   compensation is achieved by using an appropriate ratio between the
   coefficient of thermal expansion and the thermal coefficient of the
   permittivity. The theoretical prediction is confirmed by an experimental
   investigation using inductive post filters. Three commercially available
   substrates are used to design cavities at 10 GHz with the Roger TMM10
   substrate providing a close fit to the required characteristics for
   temperature compensation. The results for the cavity show a stability of
   2 ppm/degrees C in calculation and 8 ppm/degrees C in measurement. A SIW
   fourth-order Chebyshev filter, centered at 10 GHz with 1-GHz bandwidth,
   has also been designed. The measured frequency drift is 9.1 ppm/degrees
   C and the bandwidth variation is +/-0.13\% over the temperature range of
   -40 degrees C to +80 degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{Major advances in dissecting mechanisms of NO-induced down-regulation of
   the anti-tumour specific T-cell function have been accomplished during
   the last decade. In this work, we studied the effects of a NO donor
   (AT38) on leukaemic Jurkat cell bioenergetics. Culturing Jurkat cells in
   the presence of AT38 triggered irreversible inhibition of cell
   respiration, led to the depletion of 50\% of the intracellular ATP
   content and induced the arrest of cell proliferation and the loss of
   cell viability. Although a deterioration of the overall metabolic
   activity has been observed, glycolysis was stimulated, as revealed by
   the increase of glucose uptake and lactate accumulation rates as well as
   by the up-regulation of GLUT-1 and PFK-1 mRNA levels. In the presence of
   NO, cell ATP was rapidly consumed by energy-requiring apoptosis
   mechanisms; under a glucose concentration of about 12.7 mM, cell death
   was switched from apoptosis into necrosis. Exposure of Jurkat cells to
   DMSO (1\%, v/v), SA and AT55, the non-NO releasing moiety of AT38,
   failed to modulate neither cell proliferation nor bioenergetics. Thus,
   as for all NSAIDs, beneficial effects of AT38 on tumour regression are
   accompanied by the suppression of the immune system. We then showed that
   pre-treating Jurkat cells with low concentration of cyclosporine A. a
   blocker of the mitochondria transition pore, attenuates AT38-induced
   inhibition of cell proliferation and suppresses cell death. Finally, we
   have studied and compared the effects of nitrite and nitrate on Jurkat
   cells to those of NO and we are providing evidence that nitrate, which
   is considered as a biologically inert anion, has a concentration and
   time-dependent immunosuppressive potential. (c) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All

Title = {{Experimental Study to Characterize the Performance of Combined
   Photovoltaic/Thermal Air Collectors}},

Abstract = {{Combined photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) collectors show great potential for
   reaching the objective of net-zero energy consumption in buildings, but
   the number of products on the market is still very limited. One of the
   reasons for the slow market uptake of PV/T collectors is the absence of
   standardized methods to characterize their performance. Performance
   characterization is a challenge for PV/T collectors because of the
   interaction between the thermal and electrical yield. This study
   addresses this particular issue for PV/T air collectors used in either
   closed-loop or open-loop configurations. In particular, it presents the
   potential of the equivalent cell temperature method to determine the
   temperature of the PV cells in a PV/T air collector and validates models
   to predict the thermal performance and cell temperature for this
   particular type of solar collector. Indoor and outdoor experimental
   tests were performed on two c-Si unglazed PV/T modules. The indoor part
   of this procedure provided the thermal diode voltage factor and the
   open-circuit voltage temperature coefficient, two parameters that are
   essential in the calculation of the equivalent cell temperature. The
   outdoor procedure consisted of acquiring simultaneous electrical and
   thermal measurements at various inlet temperatures and flowrates. For
   the collector used in a closed-loop configuration, thermal efficiency
   models using the fluid inlet, outlet, or average temperature in the
   calculation of the reduced temperature provided similar results. For an
   open-loop configuration, a thermal efficiency model as a function of the
   fluid outlet flowrate was found to be more appropriate. Using selection
   of variable methods, it was found that a multiple linear regression
   model using the fluid inlet temperature, the irradiance, and the fluid
   outlet temperature as predictive variables could be used to estimate
   both the PV module back surface average temperature and the equivalent
   cell temperature. When using the PV temperature predicted by these
   models in the electrical efficiency model, both PV temperatures showed
   similar performance. In collectors where the PV back surface temperature
   is not accessible for temperature sensors mounting, the equivalent cell
   temperature provides a valuable alternative to be used as the PV
   temperature. The PV/T collector thermal and electrical performance in
   either closed-loop or open-loop configurations was found to be
   encapsulated with a series of five-plots. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4006576]}},

Abstract = {{In order to investigate new neurostimulation strategies for micturition
   recovery in spinal cord injured patients, custom implantable stimulators
   are required to carry-on chronic animal experiments. However, higher
   integration of the neurostimulator becomes increasingly necessary for
   miniaturization purposes, power consumption reduction, and for
   increasing the number of stimulation channels. As a first step towards
   total integration, we present in this paper the design of a
   highly-integrated neurostimulator that can be assembled on a 21-mm
   diameter printed circuit board. The prototype is based on three custom
   integrated circuits fabricated in High-Voltage (HV) CMOS technology, and
   a low-power small-scale commercially available FPGA. Using a step-down
   approach where the inductive voltage is left free up to 20 V, the
   inductive power and data recovery front-end is fully integrated. In
   particular, the front-end includes a bridge rectifier, a 20-V voltage
   limiter, an adjustable series regulator (5 to 12 V), a
   switched-capacitor step-down DC/DC converter (1: 3, 1: 2, or 2: 3
   ratio), as well as data recovery. Measurements show that the DC/DC
   converter achieves more than 86\% power efficiency while providing
   around 3.9-V from a 12-V input at 1-mA load, 1: 3 conversion ratio, and
   50-kHz switching frequency. With such efficiency, the proposed step-down
   inductive power recovery topology is more advantageous than its
   conventional step-up counterpart. Experimental results confirm good
   overall functionality of the system.}},

Abstract = {{We present, in this paper, a new full-wave CMOS rectifier dedicated for
   wirelessly-powered low-voltage biomedical implants. It uses bootstrapped
   capacitors to reduce the effective threshold voltage of selected MOS

   efficiency and low voltage-drop. Therefore, the rectifier is good for
   applications with low-voltage power supplies and large load current. The
   rectifier topology does not require complex circuit design. The highest
   voltages available in the circuit are used to drive the gates of
   selected transistors in order to reduce leakage current and to lower
   their channel on-resistance, while having high transconductance. The
   proposed rectifier was fabricated using the standard TSMC 0.18 mu m CMOS
   process. When connected to a sinusoidal source of 3.3 V peak amplitude,
   it allows improving the overall power efficiency by 11\% compared to the
   best recently published results given by a gate cross-coupled-based

   The mathematical formulation describing the simultaneous heat and mass

   These unsteady-state mathematical model equations were solved
   numerically by the commercial package FEMLAB for the temperature under
   different treatment conditions. A detailed discussion of the

   biomass interfered with probe readings and influenced application and
   interpretation of the probe readings. A novel correction factor was
   developed for the CB probes using simultaneous chlorophyll a (Chla)
   measurements. The field data demonstrate that the potential
   underestimation of cyanobacterial biomass at lower alert levels is a
   significant issue but that in vivo probes are valuable tools for higher
   alert levels.}},

Title = {{Multilevel Analysis of Trunk Surface Measurements for Noninvasive
   Assessment of Scoliosis Deformities}},

Abstract = {{Study Design. Reliability study.
   Objectives. To assess between-acquisition reliability of new multilevel
   trunk cross sections measurements, in order to define what is a real
   change when comparing 2 trunk surface acquisitions of a same patient,
   before and after surgery or throughout the clinical monitoring.
   Summary of Background Data. Several cross-sectional surface measurements
   have been proposed in the literature for noninvasive assessment of trunk
   deformity in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS).
   However, only the maximum values along the trunk are evaluated and used
   for monitoring progression and assessing treatment outcome.
   Methods. Back surface rotation (BSR), trunk rotation (TR), and coronal
   and sagittal trunk deviation are computed on 300 cross sections of the
   trunk. Each set of 300 measures is represented as a single functional
   data, using a set of basis functions. To evaluate between-acquisition
   variability at all trunk levels, a test-retest reliability study is
   conducted on 35 patients with AIS. A functional correlation analysis is
   also carried out to evaluate any redundancy between the measurements.
   Results. Each set of 300 measures was successfully described using only
   10 basis functions. The test-retest reliability of the functional
   measurements is good to very good all over the trunk, except above the
   shoulders level. The typical errors of measurement are between 1.20 and
   2.2 for the rotational measures and between 2 and 6 mm for deviation
   measures. There is a very strong correlation between BSR and TR all over
   the trunk, a moderate correlation between coronal trunk deviation and
   both BSR and TR, and no correlation between sagittal trunk deviation and
   any other measurement.
   Conclusion. This novel representation of trunk surface measurements
   allows for a global assessment of trunk surface deformity. Multilevel
   trunk measurements provide a broader perspective of the trunk deformity
   and allow a reliable multilevel monitoring during clinical follow-up of
   patients with AIS and a reliable assessment of the esthetic outcome
   after surgery.}},

Abstract = {{Backfilling contributes to the improvement of ground stability and
   reduction of ore dilution in underground mines. A critical issue for
   backfilled stope design is the required strength for the fill material.
   A practical solution to address this question was proposed by Mitchell
   and co-workers for stopes with an exposed face and a high aspect ratio
   (height H over width B). However, this solution is not directly
   applicable to stopes with a relatively low aspect ratio (H/B). Its
   application is also restricted by additional limitations on the strength
   along the fill-rock interfaces and the load applied on top of the
   backfill. In this note, the model proposed by Mitchell and co-workers is
   modified to provide an estimate of the required strength of backfill for
   various geometries, material properties, and surface loads. The modified
   Mitchell (MM) solution is validated against experimental results. Sample
   calculations with the MM solution are also presented and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) is extensively used as a
   criterion to reveal fluid flow structures, including unsteady
   separation/attachment surfaces and vortices, in laminar and turbulent
   flows. However, for large and complex problems, flow structure
   identification demands computational methodologies that are more
   accurate and effective. With this objective in mind, we propose a new
   set of ordinary differential equations to compute the flow map, along
   with its first (gradient) and second order (Hessian) spatial
   derivatives. We show empirically that the gradient of the flow map
   computed in this way improves the pointwise accuracy of the FTLE field.
   Furthermore, the Hessian allows for simple interpolation error
   estimation of the flow map, and the construction of a continuous optimal
   and multiscale L-p metric. The Lagrangian particles, or nodes, are then
   iteratively adapted on the flow structures revealed by this metric.
   Typically, the L-1 norm provides meshes best suited to capturing small
   scale structures, while the L-infinity norm provides meshes optimized to
   capture large scale structures. This means that the mesh density near
   large scale structures will be greater with the L-infinity norm than
   with the L-1 norm for the same mesh complexity, which is why we chose
   this technique for this paper. We use it to optimize the mesh in the
   vicinity of LCS. It is found that Lagrangian Coherent Structures are
   best revealed with the minimum number of vertices with the L-infinity
   metric. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The beta-phase in polypropylene (PP) induced by shear rate in a
   single-screw extruder was studied. PP samples were extruded with and
   without a breaker plate at the exit of the extruder at five different
   screw rotational speeds: 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 rpm. Differential
   scanning calorimeter was used to observe the melting behavior of the
   samples. The beta-phase was quantified by wide angle X-ray diffraction.
   Extruded samples with a breaker plate showed higher values of beta-phase
   of PP than those extruded without a breaker plate. With a breaker plate,
   the maximum percentage of beta-phase was observed at 60 rpm (19.9\%),
   whereas the maximum beta-phase content without breaker plate was
   observed at 40 rpm (13.6\%). The higher level of beta-phase with the
   breaker plate was attributed to the shear rate induction and to the
   orientation by shear of the polymer chains through the orifices of the
   breaker plate. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 2012. (C) 2012 Society of Plastics

Abstract = {{For the past decades, gas hydrate reservoirs have beneficiated from an
   increasing attention in the academic and industrial worlds. As a result,
   there is a growing need to develop specific and comprehensive gas
   hydrate reservoir characterization methods. This study explores the use
   of a stochastic Bayesian algorithm to integrate well-logs and 3D
   acoustic impedance in order to estimate gas hydrate grades (product of
   saturation and total porosity) over a representative volume of the
   Mallik gas hydrate field, located in the Mackenzie Delta, Northwest
   Territories of Canada. First, collocated log data from boreholes Mallik
   5L-38 and 2L-38 are used to estimate the statistical relationship
   between acoustic impedance and gas hydrate grades. Second, conventional
   stochastic Bayesian simulation is applied to generate multiple gas
   hydrate grade 3D fields integrating log data and lateral variability of
   3D acoustic impedance. These equiprobable scenarios permit to quantify
   the uncertainty over the estimation, and identify zones where this
   uncertainty is greater. Contrary to conventional stochastic reservoir
   modeling workflows, the proposed method allows integrating non Gaussian
   and non linear distributions. This permits to handle bimodal
   distributions without using complex stochastic transforms. The results
   present gas hydrate grade values that are in accordance with well-log
   data. The relatively low standard deviation calculated at each pixel
   using all realizations suggests that gas hydrate grades is well
   explained by acoustic impedance and log data. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This work deals with the synthesis of highly dispersed semiconducting
   nanocrystals (NCs) of cadmium sulphide (CdS), zinc sulphide (ZnS) and
   lead sulphide (PbS) through a simple and generalized process using oleic
   acid (OA) as surfactant. To synthesize these NCs, metal-oleate (M-O)
   complexes were obtained from the reaction at 140 degrees C between metal
   acetates and OA in hexanes media. Subsequently, M-O complexes were
   sulphurized using thioacetamide at the same temperature. Transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterizations
   show that the synthesized products are of nanoscale-size with highly
   crystalline cubic phase. The optical absorption of OA-capped metal
   sulphide NCs confirms that their size quantization induced a large shift
   towards visible region. Photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of CdS NCs shows
   a broad band-edge emission with shallow and deep-trap emissions, while
   PL spectrum of ZnS NCs reveals a broad emission due to defects states on
   the surface. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier transform
   infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy indicate that fatty acid monolayers were
   bound strongly on the nanocrystal surface as a carboxylate and the two
   oxygen atoms of the carboxylate were coordinated symmetrically to the
   surface of the NCs. The strong binding between the fatty acid and the
   NCs surface enhances the stability of NCs colloids. In general, this
   generalized route has a great potential in developing nanoscale metal
   sulphides for opto-electronic devices. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This article studies a single vehicle pickup and delivery problem with
   loading constraints. In this problem, the vehicle contains a number of
   (horizontal) stacks of finite capacity for loading items from the rear
   of the vehicle. Each stack must satisfy a last-in-first-out constraint
   where any new item must be loaded on top of a stack and any unloaded
   item must be on top of its stack. A large neighborhood search is
   proposed for solving this problem. Computational results are reported on
   different types of randomly generated instances. Results are also
   reported on benchmark instances for two special cases of our problem and
   a comparison is provided with state-of-the-art methods. (c) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {{An overall decline in the availability of osteogenic precursor cells and
   growth factors in the bone marrow microenvironment have been associated
   with impaired bone formation and osteopenia in humans. The objective of
   the current study was to determine if transplantation of mesenchymal
   stromal cells (MSC) from a healthy, young donor mouse into an osteopenic
   recipient mouse could enhance osseointegration of a femoral implant. MSC
   harvested from normal young adult mice differentiated into bone forming
   osteoblasts when cultured on implant grade titanium surfaces ex vivo and
   promoted bone formation around titanium-coated rods implanted in the
   femoral canal of osteopenic recipient mice. Micro computed tomographic
   imaging and histological analyses showed more, better quality, bone in
   the femur that received the MSC transplant compared with the
   contra-lateral control femur that received carrier alone. These results
   provide pre-clinical evidence that MSC transplantation promotes
   peri-implant bone regeneration and suggest the approach could be used in
   a clinical setting to enhance bone regeneration and healing in patients
   with poor quality bone. (C) 2012 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published

Abstract = {{We report on the preparation of nanocomposites consisting of
   biofunctionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (BF-SWCNTs) reinforcing
   an ultraviolet curable epoxy polymer by means of biotin-streptavidin
   interactions. The as-produced laser ablation SWCNTs are
   biofunctionalized via acid oxidization based purification process and
   non-covalent functionalization using surfactant, followed by grafting
   the resulting nanotubes with biomolecules. The biotin-grafted nanotubes
   are capable of interacting with epoxy groups in presence of streptavidin
   molecules by which chemical bridges between BF-SWCNTs and epoxy matrix
   are formed. The biomolecules grafted to the nanotubes surface not only
   facilitate the load transfer, but also improve the nanotube dispersion
   into the epoxy matrix, as observed by optical imaging and scanning
   electron microscopy. Mechanical characterization on the nanocomposite
   microfibers demonstrates considerable enhancement in both strength (by
   76\%) and modulus (by 93\%) with the addition of only 1 wt.\% of
   BF-SWCNTs. The electrical measurements reveal a clear change in
   electrical conductivity of nanocomposite microfibers reinforced with 1
   wt.\% of BF-SWCNTs in comparison to the microfibers containing solely
   purified carbon nanotubes. These multifunctional nanocomposite materials
   could be used to fabricate macro and microstructures for a wide variety
   of applications such as high strength polymer nanocomposite and
   potential easily-manipulated biosensors. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},

Month = {{JUL 19}},
Abstract = {{This paper deals with sandy aquifers. It explains how to use parameters
   of borehole samples, and data of mechanical tests performed in
   boreholes, to assess the in situ values of porosity. The concepts of
   maximum and minimum void ratios, e(max) and e(min), are presented with
   the results of studies trying to predict their values. Predictive
   equations are proposed to link the values of e(max) and e(min) to that
   of the coefficient of uniformity Cu of the grain size distribution
   curve, and the roundness factor RF of solid particles. Once the values
   of e(max) and e(min) have been estimated, those of the in situ void
   ratio e and porosity n can be assessed from the data of in situ
   mechanical tests, for example split spoon tests. An example evaluation
   is presented for an unconfined sand aquifer, which was investigated
   using boreholes, field tests, laboratory tests, slug tests in monitoring
   wells, and a long-term pumping test. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   reciprocal relation and the principle of energy conservation explains
   very well the experimental results obtained from both dc and

Abstract = {{A continuous Lagrangian sensitivity equation method (CLSEM) is presented
   as a cost effective alternative to the continuous (Eulerian) sensitivity
   equation method (CESEM) in the case of shape parameters. Boundary
   conditions for the CLSEM are simpler than those of the CESEM. However a
   mapping must be introduced to relate the undeformed and deformed
   configurations thus making the PDEs more complicated. We propose the use
   of pseudo-elasticity equations to provide a general framework to
   generate this mapping for unstructured meshes on complex geometries. The
   methodology is presented in details for the incompressible Navier-Stokes
   and sensitivity equations in variational form. The PDEs are solved with
   an adaptive FEM. Sensitivity data obtained with both approaches for a
   flow around a NACA 4512 are used to obtain estimates of flows around
   nearby geometries. Results indicate that the CLSEM produces significant
   improvements in terms of both accuracy and CPU time. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The atomic structure of ultralong carbon nanotubes obtained by catalytic
   chemical vapor deposition in the kite growth mode has been studied along
   the nanotube length via electron diffraction and high-resolution
   transmission electron microscopy. Contrary to other techniques, electron
   diffraction studies provide a direct determination of the chiral
   structure of nanotubes. These studies demonstrate that the chirality of
   the nanotubes remained constant all along their length (i.e., up to
   several hundreds of micrometers). A tendency of kite-growth nanotubes to
   be double-walled has been observed as well as a preferential
   distribution toward high-chiral angles configuration. Furthermore, the
   studies yield a metallic:semiconducting ratio close to the one expected
   from a natural distribution of nanotubes (1:2).}},

Title = {{Immunosuppressive activity enhances central carbon metabolism and
   bioenergetics in myeloid-derived suppressor cells in vitro models}},
Journal = {{BMC CELL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{JUL 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: The tumor microenvironment contains a vast array of pro-and
   anti-inflammatory cytokines that alter myelopoiesis and lead to the
   maturation of immunosuppressive cells known as myeloid-derived
   suppressor cells (MDSCs). Incubating bone marrow (BM) precursors with a
   combination of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)
   and interleukin-6 (IL-6) generated a tumor-infiltrating MDSC-like
   population that impaired anti-tumor specific T-cell functions. This in
   vitro experimental approach was used to simulate MDSC maturation, and
   the cellular metabolic response was then monitored. A complementary
   experimental model that inhibited L-arginine (L-Arg) metabolizing
   enzymes in MSC-1 cells, an immortalized cell line derived from primary
   MDSCs, was used to study the metabolic events related to
   immunosuppression.
   Results: Exposure of BM cells to GM-CSF and IL-6 activated, within 24 h,
   L-Arg metabolizing enzymes which are responsible for the MDSCs
   immunosuppressive potential. This was accompanied by an increased uptake
   of L-glutamine (L-Gln) and glucose, the latter being metabolized by
   anaerobic glycolysis. The up-regulation of nutrient uptake lead to the
   accumulation of TCA cycle intermediates and lactate as well as the
   endogenous synthesis of L-Arg and the production of energy-rich
   nucleotides. Moreover, inhibition of L-Arg metabolism in MSC-1 cells
   down-regulated central carbon metabolism activity, including glycolysis,
   glutaminolysis and TCA cycle activity, and led to a deterioration of
   cell bioenergetic status. The simultaneous increase of cell specific
   concentrations of ATP and a decrease in ATP-to-ADP ratio in BM-derived
   MDSCs suggested cells were metabolically active during maturation.
   Moreover, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was activated during MDSC
   maturation in GM-CSF and IL-6-treated cultures, as revealed by the
   continuous increase of AMP-to-ATP ratios and the phosphorylation of
   AMPK. Likewise, AMPK activity was decreased in MSC-1 cells when L-Arg
   metabolizing enzymes were inhibited. Finally, inhibition of AMPK
   activity by the specific inhibitor Compound C (Comp-C) resulted in the
   inhibition of L-Arg metabolizing enzyme activity and abolished MDSCs
   immunosuppressive activity.
   Conclusions: We anticipate that the inhibition of AMPK and the control
   of metabolic fluxes may be considered as a novel therapeutic target for
   the recovery of the immunosurveillance process in cancer-bearing hosts.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, blown films of h-LLDPE, LDPE, and their blends
   were produced using a twin screw extruder. The tear properties of all
   films were determined in the machine direction (MD) and the transverse
   direction (TD). On one hand, similar values of the MD tear-resistance
   for the two virgin polymers, h-LLDPE and LDPE, were measured to be 100
   and 120 kN/m, respectively. On the other hand, the TD tear-resistance
   value of h-LLDPE was 180 kN/m, four times higher than that of LDPE, 45
   kN/m. It was observed that small additions of LDPE (5 to 20 wt.\%) to
   h-LLDPE produced blends with better TD tear-resistance films, 400 kN/m.
   The main reason for this large increase in tear-resistance was
   attributed to the morphological changes induced by the addition of the
   LDPE polymer, as shown by SEM, FTIR, and birefringence techniques.}},

Title = {{Biorefinery implementation for recovery debottlenecking at existing pulp
   mills - Part I: Potential for debottlenecking}},
Journal = {{TAPPI JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{17-25}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Depending on the process strategy employed, implementation of the
   biorefinery into an existing pulp and paper mill can often help with
   process debottlenecking, and enable increased pulp and paper production
   capacity. Many biorefinery process options also offer the opportunity
   for bioproducts manufacturing and/or fossil fuel replacement. In this
   paper, the implementation of two biorefinery processes is examined from
   the perspective of process debottlenecking at a sodium carbonate-based
   semichemical pulp and paper mill: (a) lignin precipitation from black
   liquor by acidification with CO2, and (b) the near-neutral hemicellulose
   pre-extraction process. The recovery cycle, which includes a Copeland
   fluidized bed reactor, is the main pulp production bottleneck. Also,
   pulp quality improvements are possible, which would be achieved by
   lowering pulp yield.
   In Part I of this paper, biorefinery implementation uncertainties were
   identified and the potential for recovery debottlenecking and maximum
   paper production attainable were evaluated. In Part II, the economic
   evaluation and comparison of the selected biorefinery process options in
   the context of process debottlenecking are presented. The results show
   that for the case study mill, the hemicellulose pre-extraction process
   gives opportunity for higher paper production and paper quality
   improvement. It allows for a production increase of about 20\%, as well
   as lowering the pulp yield from 85\% to 79\%. With lignin precipitation,
   it was found that a 15\% paper production increase could be possible if
   the pulp yield is kept constant.}},

Abstract = {{We present a 3D stochastic inversion method based on the geostatistical
   approach of cokriging for inversion of magnetic anomaly data on multiple
   scale parameters using borehole and surface data to limit the resulting
   solution space. Recovering susceptibilities in 3D magnetic anomaly
   inversion requires integration of many different data. These data mainly
   come from different sources with different volume supports (point and
   block support). The presented algorithm has the capability of inverting
   data on multiple supports using downscaling and upscaling. Borehole
   susceptibilities (point support) are up-scaled to block susceptibilities
   where some of them are selected as constraints. The block constraints
   are used in magnetic anomaly inversion and, finally, the inverted
   susceptibilities are down-scaled to small prisms. Two modes of
   application are presented: estimation and simulation. The method is
   first applied to a synthetic stochastic model. The results of
   downscaling and upscaling show the ability of the method to invert
   surface and borehole' data simultaneously on multiple scale parameters.
   The results also clearly show the significant role of borehole data in
   improving depth resolution Finally, a case study Using susceptibility
   measurements collected on outcrops and on numerous borehole cores at the
   Perseverance mine (Quebec, Canada) is presented. The information from
   the recovered 3D model are useful in analyzing the geology of massive
   sulfide for the domain under study. It also shows that the addition of
   constraints at different scales helps in delineating bodies, which would
   have been missed by only using the magnetic anomaly data.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of Swedish fall cone tests and
   Casagrande liquid limit tests conducted on saline Champlain Sea clay
   samples from Lachenaie, Quebec. The main objective was to study a few
   hitherto unanswered practical questions regarding these testing methods.
   Penetration range is found to affect the Hansbo's relationship used in
   fall cone experiments, while the mass and the bluntness degree of the
   cone have no effect on it. A direct relationship between thixotropic
   regain in shear strength and sensitivity is found. When measuring the
   liquid limit, if only the first penetration depth is recorded, results
   are up to 5\% smaller than those obtained when following the standard
   procedure of CAN/BNQ-2501-092. With this standard, the average of the
   first two penetration depths within 0.3 mm of each other is recorded.
   These penetrations usually follow the bulk of the thixotropic shear
   strength regain. The Swedish fall cone was compared to the traditional
   Casagrande apparatus for liquid limit determinations. The two methods
   yielded identical results in the studied conditions (saline Lachenaie
   clay with liquid limit between 44\% and 75\%). An incorrect calibration
   of the height-of-drop of 1.4 mm led to a mean error of 6 liquid limit
   points. This error is greater than the theoretical error obtained by
   assuming that the number of blows is proportional to the square of the
   height-of-drop.}},

Title = {{Sub-second high dose rate brachytherapy Monte Carlo dose calculations
   with bGPUMCD}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{4559-4567}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To establish the accuracy and speed of bGPUMCD, a GPU-oriented
   Monte Carlo code used for high dose rate brachytherapy dose
   calculations. The first objective is to evaluate the time required for
   dose calculation when full Monte Carlo generated dose distribution
   kernels are used for plan optimization. The second objective is to
   assess the accuracy and speed when recalculating pre-optimized plans,
   consisting of many dwell positions.
   Methods: bGPUMCD is tested with three clinical treatment plans : one
   prostate case, one breast case, and one rectum case with a shielded
   applicator. Reference distributions, generated with GEANT4, are used as
   a basis of comparison. Calculations of full dose distributions of
   pre-optimized treatment plans as well as single dwell dosimetry are
   performed. Single source dosimetry, based on TG-43 parameters
   reproduction, is also presented for the microSelectron V2 (Nucletron,
   Veenendaal, The Netherlands).
   Results: In timing experiments, the computation of single dwell position
   dose kernels takes between 0.25 and 0.5 s. bGPUMCD can compute full dose
   distributions of previously optimized plans in similar to 2 s. bGPUMCD
   is capable of computing pre-optimized brachytherapy plans within 1\% for
   the prostate case and 2\% for the breast and shielded applicator cases,
   when comparing the dosimetric parameters D90 and V100 of the reference
   (GEANT4) and bGPUMCD distributions. For all voxels within the target, an
   absolute average difference of approximately 1\% is found for the
   prostate case, less than 2\% for the breast case and less than 2\% for
   the rectum case with shielded applicator. Larger point differences
   (>5\%) are found within bony regions in the prostate case, where bGPUMCD
   underdoses compared to GEANT4. Single source dosimetry results are
   mostly within 2\% for the radial function and within 1\%-4\% for the
   anisotropic function.
   Conclusions: bGPUMCD has the potential to allow for fast MC dose
   calculation in a clinical setting for all phases of HDR treatment
   planning, from dose kernel calculations for plan optimization to plan
   recalculation. (C) 2012 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

Title = {{Predictive equations for lumbar spine loads in load-dependent asymmetric
   one- and two-handed lifting activities}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{537-544}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Background: Asymmetric lifting activities are associated with low back
   pain.
   Methods: A finite element biomechanical model is used to estimate spinal
   loads during one- and two-handed asymmetric static lifting activities.
   Model input variables are thorax flexion angle, load magnitude as well
   as load sagittal and lateral positions while response variables are
   L4-L5 and L5-51 disc compression and shear forces. A number of levels
   are considered for each input variable and all their possible
   combinations are introduced into the model. Robust yet user-friendly
   predictive equations that relate model responses to its inputs are
   established.
   Findings: Predictive equations with adequate goodness-of-fit (R-2 ranged
   from similar to 94\% to 99\%, P <= 0.001) that relate spinal loads to
   task (input) variables are established. Contour plots are used to
   identify combinations of task variable levels that yield spine loads
   beyond the recommended limits. The effect of uncertainties in the
   measurements of asymmetry-related inputs on spinal loads is studied.
   Interpretation: A number of issues regarding the NIOSH asymmetry
   multiplier are discussed and it is concluded that this multiplier should
   depend on the trunk posture and be defined in terms of the load vertical
   and horizontal positions. Due to an imprecise adjustment of the handled
   load magnitude this multiplier inadequately controls the biomechanical
   loading of the spine. Ergonomists and bioengineers, faced with the
   dilemma of using either complex but more accurate models on one hand or
   less accurate but simple models on the other hand, have hereby
   easy-to-use predictive equations that quantify spinal loads under
   various occupational tasks. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{10526-10538}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Water splitting for hydrogen production through chemical looping was
   investigated in a micro fluidized bed reactor. Iron, copper and mixed
   iron copper based oxygen carriers were prepared by coprecipitation and
   incipient wetness impregnation and compared in terms of H-2 production
   via decomposition of water. The powders were completely reduced in
   hydrogen (10\%), and exposed to steam at temperature ranging from 500 to
   800 degrees C producing about 0.2 mmol of H-2 per gram of metal oxide in
   the case of a mixed Cu-Fe powder. Powders prepared by coprecipitation
   showed poor fluidization properties as well as poor reactivity compared
   to those synthesized through impregnation. Temperature Programmed
   Reductions (TPR) experiments carried out on a TGA showed that particles
   have different oxygen carrying capacities, ranging from 16\% in the case
   of a copper oxide prepared by coprecipitation, to around 1\% for other
   particles prepared impregnation. Kinetics were evaluated following gas
   solid mechanisms for two mixed Fe-Cu carriers. Oxidation of the mixed
   Fe-Cu carrier prepared by impregnation is well represented by a
   shrinking core model (phase-boundary-controlled). The activation energy
   for oxidation of this carrier was 46 kJ/mol. Oxidation of the mixed
   Fe-Cu carrier prepared by coprecipitation is well represented by a
   nuclei growth model (Avrami) with random nucleation and an activation
   energy of 51 kJ/mol. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications,

Abstract = {{The sheet resistance of graphene has been recently reduced below the
   level of previous optically transparent conductive materials, making
   graphene, with its additional advantage of mechanical flexibility, the
   best candidate for future transparent electronics. We investigate here
   the viability of microwave planar components using graphene sheets as
   conductors towards optically transparent and flexible radio systems.
   Specifically, we study the waveguiding and nonreciprocal properties of
   such components, through the arbitrary example of a coplanar waveguide
   (CPW) structure, using the 2-D finite difference frequency domain (FDFD)
   technique. It is shown that reciprocal graphene-based components of
   acceptably low loss levels are achievable using graphene sheets of the
   lowest available resistivity, while nonreciprocal components with
   graphene conductors still exhibit prohibitive loss due to a fundamental
   trade-off between nonreciprocity and carrier density in graphene.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present an implantable device for intra-cerebral
   electroencephalography (icEEG) data acquisition and real-time epileptic
   seizure detection with simultaneous focal antiepileptic drug injection
   feedback. This implantable device includes a neural signal amplifier, an
   asynchronous seizure detector, a drug delivery system (DDS) including a
   micropump, and a hybrid subdural electrode (HSE). The asynchronous
   detection algorithm is based on data-dependent analysis and validated
   with Matlab tools. The detector and DDS have a power saving mode. The
   HSE contacts are made of Platinum (Pt) encapsulated with
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Given the heterogeneity of electrographic
   seizure signals and seizure suppression threshold, the implantable
   device provides tunable parameters facility through an external
   transmitter to adapt to each individual's neurophysiology prior to
   clinical deployment. The proposed detector and DDS were assembled in
   circle divide 50 mm and circle divide 30 mm circular printed circuit
   boards, respectively. The detector was validated using icEEG recordings
   of seven patients who had previously undergone an intracranial
   investigation for epilepsy surgery. The triggering of the DDS was tested
   and a predefined seizure suppression dose was delivered similar to 16 s
   after electrographical seizure onsets. The device's power consumption
   was reduced by 12\% in active mode and 49\% in power saving mode
   compared to similar seizure detection algorithms implemented with
   synchronous architecture.}},

Abstract = {{Repeaters are now widely used to enhance the performance of long on-chip
   interconnects in CMOS devices. For RC-as well as RLC-modeled
   interconnects, parallel repeaters (PRs) have proved to be superior to
   serial ones. In a previous work, a new regeneration technique, named
   variable-segment, was proven to outperform other existing regeneration
   techniques including variable-repeater techniques. In this paper, an
   approximate analytical delay model is presented for both the
   variable-repeater and variable-segment parallel regeneration techniques.
   This model is used to confirm the optimality of our design and is built
   based on first and second-moment transfer functions, which take into
   account the inductive effects of interconnects. HSpice electrical and C
   + +/MATLAB simulations are conducted to assess the performance of the
   proposed optimization methodology using 0.25-mu m CMOS technology. The
   mathematical simulation results are remarkably in agreement with those
   obtained from electrically simulated variable-repeater and
   variable-segment structures which are used in this work to regenerate
   interconnect lengths ranging from 0.1 to 10?cm. This work is part of a
   first-of-its-kind global theory on PRs in repeater-insertion
   methodologies for long on-chip interconnects. This theory aims at
   exploring the different degrees of freedom in interconnect modeling as
   well as repeater type and design parameters. Copyright (c) 2011 John

   releasing a strained semiconductor bilayer and are picked up by abruptly
   tapered optical fibers for subsequent coupling with adiabatically
   tapered optical fibers. As a result of absorption by InAs quantum dots
   embedded in the tube structure, these microtubes show dynamical thermal
   effects at wavelengths around 1525 nm and 1578 nm, while they are
   passive at longer wavelengths near 1634 nm. The photon absorption
   induced thermal effect is visualized by generating a pair of
   microbottles. The dynamical thermal effect can be avoided or exploited
   for passive or active applications by utilizing appropriate resonance
   wavelengths. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the analysis of viscoelastic bonding strength of
   carbon/epoxy laminates with different surface treatments. Bonding is a
   well known technique, and is widely used in many industrial
   applications. Rigid bonding aims at transferring structural and
   vibration loads from one laminate to the other. The use of dissipative
   bonding material also helps reducing structural vibrations in many key
   applications. In this work, the bonding strength of carbon/epoxy
   substrates with viscoelastic acrylic adhesive was measured by means of a
   wedge test. The surface finish, which plays an important role in
   bonding, was characterized using a surface profiler and the Ondulo(MD)
   system. Surface roughness and concentration of surface porosities were
   measured to define the quality of the laminate surface. It is shown that
   the final crack length decreases with increasing wedge penetration rate
   and increasing density of surface porosities. The surface pre-treatment
   with primer also reduces crack length, and thus increases fracture
   energy. The fracture energy ranges between 300 J/m(2) and 3000 J/m(2).
   The proportion of this energy which is due to dissipation in the
   adhesive, increases with the wedge penetration rate and reaches up to
   60\% of the total fracture energy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We study a class of linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) control problems
   with decision makers, where the basic objective is to minimize a social
   cost as the sum of individual costs containing mean field coupling. The
   exact socially optimal solution (determining a particular Pareto
   optimum) requires centralized information for each agent and has high
   implementational complexity. As an alternative we subsequently exploit a
   mean field structure in the centralized optimal control problem to
   develop decentralized cooperative optimization so that each agent only
   uses its own state and a function which may be computed offline; the
   resulting set of strategies asymptotically achieves the social optimum
   as. A key feature in this scheme is to let each agent optimize a new
   cost as the sum of its own cost and another component capturing its
   social impact on all other agents. We also discuss the relationship
   between the decentralized cooperative solution and the so-called Nash
   Certainty Equivalence based solution presented in previous work on mean
   field LQG games.}},

Abstract = {{Cardiac fibers, as well as their local arrangement in laminar sheets,
   have a complex spatial variation of their orientation that has an
   important role in mechanical and electrical cardiac functions. In this
   paper, a statistical atlas of this cardiac fiber architecture is built
   for the first time using human datasets. This atlas provides an average
   description of the human cardiac fiber architecture along with its
   variability within the population. In this study, the population is
   composed of ten healthy human hearts whose cardiac fiber architecture is
   imaged ex vivo with DT-MRI acquisitions. The atlas construction is based
   on a computational framework that minimizes user interactions and
   combines most recent advances in image analysis: graph cuts for
   segmentation, symmetric log-domain diffeomorphic demons for
   registration, and log-Euclidean metric for diffusion tensor processing
   and statistical analysis. Results show that the helix angle of the
   average fiber orientation is highly correlated to the transmural depth
   and ranges from -41 degrees on the epicardium to +66 degrees on the
   endocardium. Moreover, we find that the fiber orientation dispersion
   across the population (+/- 13 degrees) is lower than for the laminar
   sheets (+/- 31 degrees). This study, based on human hearts, extends
   previous studies on other mammals with concurring conclusions and
   provides a description of the cardiac fiber architecture more specific
   to human and better suited for clinical applications. Indeed, this
   statistical atlas can help to improve the computational models used for
   radio-frequency ablation, cardiac resynchronization therapy, surgical
   ventricular restoration, or diagnosis and followups of heart diseases
   due to fiber architecture anomalies.}},

Abstract = {{Voltage-source-converter (VSC) technologies present a bright opportunity
   in a variety of fields within the power system industry. New modular
   multilevel converters (MMCs) are expected to supersede two-and

   recognized advantages in terms of scalability, performance, and
   efficiency. The computational burden introduced by detailed modeling of
   MMC-HVDC systems in electromagnetic-transients (EMT)-type programs
   complicates the study of transients especially when these systems are
   integrated into a large network. This paper presents a novel
   average-value model (AVM) for efficient and accurate representation of a
   detailed MMC-HVDC system. It also develops a detailed 401-level MMC-HVDC
   model for validating the AVM and studies the performance of both models
   when integrated into a large 400-kV transmission system in Europe. The
   results show that the AVM is significantly more efficient while
   maintaining its accuracy for the dynamic response of the overall system.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past twenty years, several computer models for structured
   catalytic reactors such as the monolith converter have been developed
   with various levels of complexity and accuracy. Despite the availability
   of faster and faster computers, no reports have been made yet on the
   successful simulation of transport phenomena in every channel of a
   monolith catalytic converter by means of a full three-dimensional
   discrete model. The purpose of this work is to show the potential of
   such a model, based on the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), for
   simulating fluid flow in an elliptical shaped honeycomb monolith reactor
   comprising a total of 7539 parallel channels. This example of industrial
   relevance will serve to evidence the progress made in computer modeling
   in recent years, but also to bring up aspects that need to be further
   improved, such as the use of LBM to simulate efficiently turbulent flow
   and heat and mass transfer in this type of structured catalytic
   reactors. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, an innovative permeability device allowing permeability
   measurement simultaneously to loading was used to investigate the water
   permeability and self-healing of reinforced concrete. The experimental
   conditions focused on normal strength concrete (NSC) and fiber
   reinforced concrete (FRC) tie specimens under static and constant
   tensile loadings. Crack pattern and crack openings under the same
   loadings were measured on companion specimens. Experimental results
   emphasized the positive contribution of fibers to the durability of
   reinforced concrete. Under static tensile loading, the FRC tie specimens
   were 60\% to 70\% less permeable than the NSC tie specimens at the same
   level of stress in the reinforcement. After 6 days of constant loading,
   the FRC showed greater self-healing capacity with a reduction in water
   penetration of 70\% in comparison to 50\% for the NSC. The main cause of
   self-healing was the formation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). (C) 2012

Abstract = {{We compared the averages of P-wave velocities (V-p) for four lithologies
   (felsic gneiss, eclogite, retrograde eclogite, and amphibolite)
   collected from core material sampled by the Chinese Continental
   Scientific Drilling Project (CCSD) at depths to 5158 m, and from surface
   outcrops in the Dabie-Sulu (China) ultrahigh-pressure metamorphic
   terrane. The velocities were measured at pressures to 800 MPa for 69
   CCSD samples and 145 surface samples. The V-p-pressure relationship is
   described by a four-parameter exponential equation, allowing the
   determination of the crack-closing pressure (P-c), the intrinsic
   pressure derivative of velocity (D), the intrinsic velocity of the
   crack-free compacted rock at zero pressure (V-0), and the maximum
   velocity increase due to crack closure (B-0). The shape of the nonlinear
   segment of the velocity-pressure curve is controlled by a decay
   parameter (k). The CCSD core samples are characterized by significantly
   higher V-0, B-0, and k values and lower D and P-c compared to their
   surface analogues. This suggests that extrapolation of the surface rock
   data to depth may result in substantial underestimates in seismic
   velocities, and that the intrinsic pressure derivatives obtained from
   the V-p-pressure relations for the core samples are more suitable for
   the determination of in situ velocities at great depth than those
   derived from measurements on rocks exposed at the surface.}},

Abstract = {{Materials containing from 41 to 1124 mg chlorine and surrounded by
   polyethylene containers of various thicknesses, from 0.01 to 5.6 mm,
   were irradiated in a research reactor neutron spectrum and the Cl-38
   activity produced was measured as a function of polyethylene reflector
   thickness. For the material containing the higher amount of chlorine,
   the Cl-38 specific activity decreased with increasing reflector
   thickness, indicating increased neutron self-shielding. It was found
   that the amount of neutron self-shielding increased by as much as 52\%
   with increasing reflector thickness. This is explained by neutrons which
   have exited the material subsequently reflecting back into it and thus
   increasing the total mean path length in the material. All physical and
   empirical models currently used to predict neutron self-shielding have
   ignored this effect and need to be modified. A method is given for
   measuring the adjustable parameter of a self-shielding model for a
   particular sample size and combination of neutron reflectors.}},

Journal = {{SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{709-724}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{We present an original approach to identify synchronize (SYN) flooding
   attacks from the victim's side, on the basis of a classification of the
   different forms that TCP handshakes can take during a connection set-up
   between a client and a server (e.g. for Web traffic). We first identify
   the unusual handshake sequences that result from an attack and show how
   such observations can be used for SYN flooding attack detection. We then
   introduce a data structure to monitor, in real time, the state of the
   TCP handshake and study its performance. In addition, we explain the
   management of the data structure for operations such as initialization,
   adding and removing flows. Finally, we analyse the effectiveness of our
   TCP handshake monitoring to identify the presence of SYN flooding
   attacks by applying it to real traffic traces. To allow quick protection
   and help guarantee a proper defence, the detection is done in real time.
   Our detection system uses a non-parametric cumulative sum algorithm
   (CUSUM), which has the benefit of not requiring a detailed model of the
   normal and attack traffic while achieving excellent detection levels.

Abstract = {{We study the weighted circuit constraint in the context of constraint
   programming. It appears as a substructure in many practical
   applications, particularly routing problems. We propose a domain
   filtering algorithm for the weighted circuit constraint that is based on
   the 1-tree relaxation of Held and Karp. In addition, we study domain
   filtering based on an additive bounding procedure that combines the
   1-tree relaxation with the assignment problem relaxation. Experimental
   results on Traveling Salesman Problem instances demonstrate that our
   filtering algorithms can dramatically reduce the problem size. In
   particular, the search tree size and solving time can be reduced by
   several orders of magnitude, compared to existing constraint programming
   approaches. Moreover, for medium-size problem instances, our method is
   competitive with the state-of-the-art special-purpose TSP solver

Title = {{Systematic disaggregation: a hybrid LCI computation algorithm enhancing
   interpretation phase in LCA}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{774-786}},

Abstract = {{Before the advent of large databases, practitioners often lacked data
   for calculating life cycle inventories, but the actual computation was a
   straightforward task. Now that databases represent supply chains
   including feedback loops and several thousand unit processes and
   emissions, more formalized calculation methods are necessary. Two
   methods are widely used: sequential method and matrix inversion. They
   both exhibit different advantages and drawbacks. The present paper
   proposes a hybrid algorithm combining the advantages of both methods
   while minimizing their inconveniences.
   Sequential algorithm requires a form of cutoff criteria, as the supply
   chains are of infinite length in the presence of feedback loops. The
   proposed implementation allows the detailing of individual paths until
   their upstream contribution falls below a user-defined disaggregation
   criteria, while also allowing the total impact scores of all paths to be
   stored and considered. The output is then structured to facilitate
   consultation and re-aggregation, enhancing the work of practitioners in
   the interpretation phase of LCA. The algorithm is a variation on
   structural path analysis and accumulative structural path analysis. It
   is computationally efficient and uses a reporting threshold criterion
   based on multiple impact categories.
   Although the algorithm leads to a more voluminous inventory than matrix
   inversion, it produces detailed, useful information on the particular
   instances of processes responsible for the impacts. An average laptop
   can compute the results within seconds. This algorithm has the potential
   to improve the interpretation phase of LCA. More specifically, selective
   replacement of values (characterization factors, input from
   technosphere, or emission intensities) in parts of the process tree can
   be applied without affecting the rest of the system.
   LCA software would benefit from the inclusion of the algorithm presented
   in this paper. It produces additional information on the structure of
   the supply chain and the impacts of its constituents, which would be
   available for a more in-depth interpretation by practitioners. Its
   potential for understanding the propagation of uncertainty and
   acceleration of Monte Carlo assessment should also be investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Many-core platforms, providing large numbers of parallel execution
   resources, emerge as a response to the increasing computation needs of
   embedded applications. A major challenge raised by this trend is the
   efficient mapping of applications on parallel resources. This is a
   nontrivial problem because of the number of parameters to be considered
   for characterizing both the applications and the underlying platform
   architectures. Recently, several authors have proposed to use
   multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to solve this problem within the
   context of mapping applications on network-on-chips. However, these
   proposals have several limitations: (1) only few metaheuristics are
   explored (mainly Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm?II and Strength
   Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm?2), (2) only few objective functions are
   provided, and (3) they only deal with a small number of the application
   and architecture constraints. In this paper, we propose a new framework
   that avoids all of the problems cited previously. Our framework is
   implemented on top of the jMetal framework, which offers an extensible
   environment. Our framework allows designers to (1) explore several new
   metaheuristics, (2) easily add a new objective function (or to use an
   existing one), and (3) take into account any number of architecture and
   application constraints. The paper also presents experiments
   illustrating how our framework is applied to the problem of mapping
   streaming applications on an NoC-based many-core platform. Our results
   show that several new metaheuristics outperform the classical
   multi-objective metaheuristics such as Nondominated Sorting Genetic
   Algorithm?II and Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm?2. Moreover, a
   parallel multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is implemented in our
   framework in order to increase the explored space of solutions by
   simultaneously running several metaheuristics. Copyright (C) 2011 John

Abstract = {{The relation between the magnetoimpedance and the magnetic properties of
   a wide set of soft magnetic microwires from several sources has been
   studied. Magnetic properties were obtained by vibrating sample
   magnetometry and ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The
   magnetoimpedance voltage sensitivity of each sample, the criterion of
   interest for high sensitivity magnetometer design, was then evaluated at
   several frequencies and drive currents. It appears that all samples
   possess roughly similar properties, regardless of their fabrication
   process or chemical composition. The voltage sensitivity of the samples
   obtained from experimental measurement is compared with a simple model
   of sensitivity. The general trends predicted by the model provide useful
   insights for materials optimization. Averaged sensitivity over the
   sample set is around 10 kV/T/cm at 10 MHz. The critical importance for
   sensitive magnetometry of the maximum excitation current permissible in

Abstract = {{A Butler beam-forming network with low sidelobe level (SLL) is proposed
   and demonstrated on the basis of variable couplers. A set of couplers
   with 0.75, 1.26, 3, 6 and 8 dB coupling levels are required to achieve
   an SLL of -13.6, -20 and -30 dB. Such variable coupling is achieved by
   creating a movable mirror structure in the common region of
   perpendicularly or cross-coupled waveguide building blocks. This mirror
   is composed of a 5 x 7 cylindrical rod array. The coupling and
   directivity characteristics depend on the position of this proposed
   fringe structure. In this work, WR28 is used to demonstrate the
   capability of this type of coupler over 26-30 GHz bandwidth. Structure
   usefulness and design procedure are validated by electromagnetic
   simulation high frequency structural simulator (HFSS) and prototype
   experimentation. Very good results are observed, that have also
   demonstrated attractive performances of the coupler. Measured results of
   couplers are used to assess the properties of Butler matrix with
   excitation coefficients corresponding to 13.6, 20 and 30 dB of SLLs.
   Radiation patterns obtained by this investigation show a promising
   performance. This proposed technique allows flexibility in the choice of
   excitation coefficients without degradation on the efficiency.}},

Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Rationale: Glucose enhancing effects in older adults have mostly been
   observed for episodic memory, but have recently been found for
   attentional control performance. Yet, brain activation patterns
   underlying these effects are still unknown.
   Objective: The present study examined the acute effects of glucose
   ingestion on prefrontal brain activation during the execution of a
   divided attention task in fasting non-diabetic older adults.
   Methods: Twenty older adults (60 years and older) took part in the study
   that included two experimental sessions. After an overnight fast,
   participants received either a glucose drink (50 g) or a placebo
   (saccharin) drink, following which they completed a dual-task. During
   task execution, prefrontal activation was recorded with functional
   near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). A repeated-measures design was used
   such that each participant served as his or her own control. The two
   experimental sessions were counterbalanced among participants and were
   performed two weeks apart.
   Results: When participants were in the glucose condition, they showed
   similar dual-task costs for both tasks, whereas in the placebo condition
   they prioritized one task over the other, with a significantly larger
   dual-task cost for the non-prioritized task (p < 0.01). Differential
   brain activation was also observed in right ventral-lateral prefrontal
   regions for oxygenated hemoglobin and deoxygenated hemoglobin, with more
   activation apparent in the glucose condition (p < 0.05). Furthermore,
   behavioral and activation data were influenced by individual differences
   in glucose regulation.
   Conclusions: Glucose ingestion appears to momentarily enhance fasting
   seniors' capacity to coordinate more equally two concurrent tasks and
   this is reflected in brain activation patterns. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Study Design. Numerical modeling and simulations of scoliotic spine
   instrumentation using monoaxial, uniaxial, polyaxial, and
   multiple-degrees-of-freedom (6DOF) postloading pedicle screws.
   Objective. To biomechanically analyze the general curve reduction
   effects and bone-screw force levels of monoaxial, uniaxial, polyaxial,
   and 6DOF pedicle screws for scoliotic spine instrumentation.
   Summary of Background Data. The ideal spinal fusion construct for
   treating scoliosis is still debatable. Studies on the effects of
   different types of implants were mainly based on postoperative
   radiograph measurements. Systematic studies are yet to be done on how
   bone-screw forces are correlated with screw types.
   Methods. Computer biomechanical models were built using 3-dimensional
   geometry and spine stiffness of 10 patients with adolescent idiopathic
   scoliosis having undergone spinal instrumentation. The surgical
   instrumentations were simulated each time, using a different type of
   screw. For each case and screw type, 15 screw placement variations were
   simulated to investigate their effects on bone-screw forces.
   Results. The maximum differences between different screw types were 6.4,
   1.1, and 4.7, respectively, for main thoracic Cobb angles, main thoracic
   apical vertebral rotation, and thoracic kyphosis (1.2, 0.3, and 0.3 on
   average). The average bone-screw forces were higher for monoaxial (229 N
   +/- 140 N) than uniaxial (206 N +/- 122 N), polyaxial (141 N +/- 99 N),
   and 6DOF screws (103 N +/- 42 N). Bone-screw forces with monoaxial
   screws were, respectively, 1.1, 2.5, and 25 times more sensitive to
   screw placement variation than uniaxial, polyaxial, and 6DOF screws.
   Conclusion. The bone-screw loads of different screws were significantly
   different. The descending order of bone-screw loads was monoaxial,
   uniaxial, polyaxial, and 6DOF screws. For patients with large and stiff
   spinal deformities or for patients with compromised bone quality, screws
   with more degrees of freedom offer better perspective to reduce
   bone-screw connection failure.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{208}},
Pages = {{18-23}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Laboratory-scale microbial fuel cells are often operated with a constant
   electrical load. Meanwhile, variations in influent strength and quality,
   as well as the processes of biofilm growth and decay lead to significant
   changes of the MFC internal resistance over time. This inevitably
   results in a mismatch between the internal and the external resistances
   therefore decreasing MFC power output. This study presents the concept
   of MFC operation with intermittent connection of the electrical load
   (external resistance). The efficiency of the proposed method is
   demonstrated by MFC operation with external resistances significantly
   below the MFC internal resistance and comparing power outputs obtained
   using either constant or intermittently connected resistances. Crown

Abstract = {{Cast films of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and polypropylene (PP) with 2.5
   and 5 wt \% organo modified nanoclay were prepared and then uniaxially
   and biaxially hot drawn at T = 90 and 155 degrees C, respectively, using
   a biaxial stretcher. The orientation of PLA and PP crystal unit cells,
   alignment of clay platelets, as well as the extent of intercalation and
   exfoliation were studied using wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). The
   measurement of d-spacing of the 001 plane (normal to platelets plane) of
   the clay tactoids indicated the intercalation of the silicate layers for
   the PLA nanocomposite films, whereas the PP nanofilled films showed only
   dispersion of the nanoparticles (i.e., neither intercalation nor
   exfoliation were observed). The intercalation level of the clay
   platelets in PLA was almost identical for the uniaxially and biaxially
   drawn films. Our finding showed that the crystallite unit cell
   alignments are appreciably dependent on uniaxial and biaxial stretching.
   Moreover, the incorporation of clay to some extent influenced the
   orientation of the crystal unit cell axes (a, b, and c) of the oriented
   films. The silicate layers revealed a much higher orientation into the
   flow direction in the uniaxially stretched films compared to the
   biaxially drawn samples. In addition, the orientation of the 001 plane
   of nanoclays was significantly greater in the PLA compared to the PP
   nanoclay composite films probably due to a better intercalation and
   stress transfer in the former. Morphological pictograms illustrating the
   effects of uniaxial and biaxial stretching on the clay orientation are
   proposed. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci, 2011}},

Abstract = {{We present recent advances in modeling, design, and fabrication of
   in-plane multilayer optical resonators fabricated by high aspect ratio
   etching of silicon. We first revisit the model of Gaussian beam
   divergence proposed by A. Lipson et al. to correct a mistake that leads
   to an underestimation of the losses affecting this type of resonator.
   Secondly, we discuss the influence of surface roughness at the
   silicon-air interfaces of multilayered structures. Roughness
   profiles-measured by white light interferometry on the sidewalls of
   silicon trenches etched by deep reactive ion etching (DRIE)-are
   presented. The single absorbing layer model of Carniglia et al. is used
   to predict the influence of the measured roughness (30 +/- 5 nm RMS).
   This model is combined with the corrected model for Gaussian beam
   divergence and is compared with recent experimental results obtained for
   a new generation of deep-etched Fabry-Perot refractive index sensors.
   These sensors are fabricated using the contour lithography method, which
   is demonstrated to greatly improve the predictability of their optical
   characteristics. The combined model for roughness and divergence is
   found to correspond remarkably well with the experimental results, with
   predictions of loss and finesse of the resonances within an average
   error of 1.3 dB and 25\%, respectively. We therefore expect the models
   and the simulations presented in this article to become a useful tool
   for the design of devices based on deep-etched multilayer resonators.}},

Abstract = {{High particulate lead (Pb) levels can be measured in tap water, but the
   hazard linked to particulate Pb ingestion is unknown. An in vitro test
   was developed to determine the bioaccessibility of Pb particles from tap
   water, based on the Relative Bioaccessibility Leaching Procedure
   validated for soils, and applied to lab-generated particles and field
   particles collected behind the aerator tap. Field particles were found
   in 43\% of the 342 taps investigated equipped with an aerator, and
   contained significant amounts of Pb (0.003-71\%, median 4.7\%). The
   bioaccessibility of lab-generated particles ranged from 2 to 96\%
   depending on the particle type (Pb(II) > Brass > Pb(IV) > solder), while
   that of field particles was distributed between 1.5 and 100\% (median
   41\%). The hazard of particulate Pb ingestion depends on the amount and
   concentration ingested, and the bioaccessibility of the particulate Pb
   forms involved. Using the Integrated Exposure Uptake Biokinetic model,
   the impact of particulate Pb on the exposure of children aged 0.5-7 for
   the distribution system studied was the most significant when
   considering a fraction of the exposure from large buildings.}},

Title = {{3D stability analysis of gravity dams on sloped rock foundations using

Abstract = {{A convenient approach to performing stability analysis of concrete
   gravity dams is the so-called two-dimensional ``gravity method.{''}
   However, concrete gravity dams located in valleys with sloped rock
   foundation abutments behave as three-dimensional (3D) structures and are
   often able to share compressive and shear loads between adjacent
   monoliths, especially when shear keys are present. A general 3D limit
   equilibrium method was developed in this study to compute global sliding
   safety factors (SSFg) by considering sequential load redistribution
   among adjacent monoliths when individual monoliths have mobilized their
   sliding strength. Two validation examples of the sliding safety
   assessment of existing dams are presented to illustrate the accuracy and
   efficiency of the proposed approach compared to that of the full 3D
   numerical analyses conducted using the distinct element method. It is
   shown that gravity dams may be formed by individual monoliths on sloped
   rock foundations that will slide if considered as isolated structures
   but will constitute a stable assembly when the load-sharing capabilities
   of monoliths are recognized in the analysis. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The knowing the critical current density J(C) is important to calculate
   AC losses in superconducting applications. Usually J(C) can be obtained
   from magnetization measurements or electric measurements based on global
   quantities as the magnetic flux or the voltage. In this paper a quick
   and direct magnetic method for determining J(C) is proposed. It is based
   on direct measurements of local magnetic field in the gap between two
   bulk HTS pellets. Field penetration measurements were carried out on HTS
   pellets at 77 K by applying increasing axial magnetic fields with a
   quasi constant sweep rate. This determination of J(C) is theoretically
   based on Bean model. J(C) is deduced from the complete penetration
   magnetic field B-P. B-P is deduced from the delay T-P between the
   applied magnetic field B-a(t) and the magnetic field at the center
   between the two pellets B-o(t). Numerical calculations allow deducing
   J(C) more precisely from theoretical calculations and measurements. The
   numerical calculations are made with the power law E = E-C(J/J(C))(n).
   For the determination of J(C) the influence of the gap due to Hall probe
   sensor and the applied magnetic field rise rate are taken into account.
   The influence of thermal is also studied.}},

Abstract = {{Effect of temperature on hydrodynamics of bubbling gas-solid fluidized
   beds was investigated. Experiments were carried out in the range of
   25-600 degrees C and different superficial gas velocities in the range
   of 0.17-0.78 m/s with sand particles. Time-position trajectory of
   particles was obtained by radioactive particle tracking technique. These
   data were used for determination of mean velocities of upward-moving
   (including bubble wake and ascending clusters) and downward-moving
   (descending clusters) particles. It was found that the upward velocity
   increases by increasing temperature up to 300 degrees C, however, it
   decreases by further increase in temperature. Due to the wall effect,
   there is no significant change in the mean velocity of downward-moving
   clusters. The change in hydrodynamic parameters with temperature can be
   a consequence of changing physical properties of the bed which have been
   represented by Reynolds number in this study.}},

Abstract = {{The Wolsong-1 (W-1) Phase-B pre-simulations were carried out in
   preparation for tests to be conducted for the restart of the reactor
   after a major refurbishment project that included replacement of the
   pressure tube. These pre-simulations for Wolsong-1 Phase-B differ from
   those in the past that were performed for the Wolsong-1,2,3,4 tests in
   that these tests use the WIMS/DRAGON/RFSP-IST code suite for
   verification of the tests and gadolinium instead of the traditional
   PPV/MULTICELL/RFSP code system and boron as poison in the moderator
   system. The use of gadolinium is deemed not to have domestically
   accumulated experience gained from the previous Phase-B tests. Thus, it
   is appropriate to conduct a study in order to gain a correct
   understanding and interpretation of potential differences in test
   results stemming from using gadolinium rather than boron. Although the
   calibration of the reactivity device will not be noticeably different
   using boron and gadolinium at a constant moderator temperature, the
   temperature dependency of the neutronic behavior due to the presence of
   gadolinium in the moderator system might be pronounced. The results of
   the pre-simulations using gadolinium revealed that the moderator
   temperature reactivity coefficients indeed showed significant
   differences in comparison with those with boron. In order to secure the
   validity of the analysis results, the newly acquired
   WIMS/DRAGON/RFSP-IST code suite was verified against the W-2,3,4 Phase-B
   test results. The results of the new code suite verifications revealed
   some overall improvements in accuracy; justification of the use of the
   code can be claimed for the validation of the W-1 Phase-B test results}},

Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{There is evidence that some atypical antipsychotics, including
   olanzapine, can produce unwanted metabolic side effects, weight gain and
   diabetes. However, neuronal correlates of change related to food
   information processing have not been investigated with these
   medications. We studied the effect of a pharmacological manipulation
   with an antipsychotic known to cause weight gain on metabolites,
   cognitive tasks and neural correlates related to food regulation. We
   used functional magnetic resonance imaging in conjunction with a task
   requiring visual processing of appetitive stimuli in schizophrenic
   patients and healthy controls before and after 16 weeks of antipsychotic
   medication with olanzapine. In patients, the psychological and neuronal
   changes associated following the treatment correlated with appetite
   control measures and metabolite levels in fasting blood samples. After
   16 weeks of olanzapine treatment, the patients gained weight, increased
   their waist circumference, had fewer positive schizophrenia symptoms, a
   reduced ghrelin plasma concentration and an increased concentration of
   triglycerides, insulin and leptin. In premotor area, somatosensory
   cortices as well as bilaterally in the fusiform gyri, the olanzapine
   treatment increased the neural activity related to appetitive
   information in schizophrenic patients to similar levels relative to
   healthy individuals. However, a higher increase in sensitivity to
   appetitive stimuli after the treatment was observed in insular cortices,
   amygdala and cerebellum in schizophrenic patients as compared with
   healthy controls. Furthermore, these changes in neuronal activity
   correlated with changes in some metabolites and cognitive measurements
   related to appetite regulation. Translational Psychiatry (2012) 2, e128;

Abstract = {{Research into Parkinson's disease (PD) is difficult and time consuming.
   It is a complex condition that develops over many decades in the human
   brain. For such apparently intractable diseases, mathematical models can
   offer an additional means of investigation. As a contribution to this
   process, the authors have developed an ordinary differential equation
   model of the most important cellular processes that have been associated
   with PD. The model describes the following processes: (i) cellular
   generation and scavenging of reactive oxygen species; (ii) the possible
   damage and removal of the protein alpha-synuclein and, (iii) feedback
   interactions between damaged alpha-synuclein and reactive oxygen
   species. Simulation results show that the Parkinsonian condition, with
   elevated oxidative stress and misfolded alpha-synuclein accumulation,
   can be induced in the model by known PD risk factors such as ageing,
   exposure to toxins and genetic defects. The significant outcome of the
   paper is the demonstration that it is possible to reproduce in silico
   the multi-factorial interactions that characterise the pathogenesis of
   PD. As such, the model provides a systematic explanation of the
   variability and heterogeneity of PD and provides the basis for
   computational studies of further facets of this complex multi-factorial
   condition.}},

Abstract = {{Previous article on the integrative modelling of Parkinson's disease
   (PD) described a mathematical model with properties suggesting that PD
   pathogenesis is associated with a feedback-induced biochemical
   bistability. In this article, the authors show that the dynamics of the
   mathematical model can be extracted and distilled into an equivalent
   two-state feedback motif whose stability properties are controlled by
   multi-factorial combinations of risk factors and genetic mutations
   associated with PD. Based on this finding, the authors propose a
   principle for PD pathogenesis in the form of the switch-like transition
   of a bistable feedback process from `healthy' homeostatic levels of
   reactive oxygen species and the protein alpha-synuclein, to an
   alternative `disease' state in which concentrations of both molecules
   are stable at the damagingly high-levels associated with PD. The
   bistability is analysed using the rate curves and steady-state response
   characteristics of the feedback motif. In particular, the authors show
   how a bifurcation in the feedback motif marks the pathogenic moment at
   which the `healthy' state is lost and the `disease' state is initiated.
   Further analysis shows how known risks (such as: age, toxins and genetic
   predisposition) modify the stability characteristics of the feedback
   motif in a way that is compatible with known features of PD, and which
   explain properties such as: multi-factorial causality, variability in
   susceptibility and severity, multi-timescale progression and the special
   cases of familial Parkinson's and Parkinsonian symptoms induced purely
   by toxic stress.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we present an implantable closed-loop epilepsy
   prosthesis, which is dedicated to automatically detect seizure onsets
   based on intracerebral electroencephalographic (icEEG) recordings from
   intracranial electrode contacts and provide an electrical stimulation
   feedback to the same contacts in order to disrupt these seizures. A
   novel epileptic seizure detector and a dedicated electrical stimulator
   were assembled together with common recording electrodes to complete the
   proposed prosthesis. The seizure detector was implemented in CMOS
   0.18-mu m by incorporating a new seizure detection algorithm that models
   time-amplitude and -frequency relationship in icEEG. The detector was
   validated offline on ten patients with refractory epilepsy and showed
   excellent performance for early detection of seizures. The electrical
   stimulator, used for suppressing the developing seizure, is composed of
   two biphasic channels and was assembled with embedded FPGA in a
   miniature PCB. The stimulator efficiency was evaluated on cadaveric
   animal brain tissue in an in vitro morphologic electrical model. Spatial
   characteristics of the voltage distribution in cortex were assessed in
   an attempt to identify optimal stimulation parameters required to affect
   the suspected epileptic focus. The experimental results suggest that
   lower frequency stimulation parameters cause significant amount of
   shunting of current through the cerebrospinal fluid; however higher
   frequency stimulation parameters produce effective spatial voltage
   distribution with lower stimulation charge.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. We examined the extent to which differential traffic volume
   and road geometry can explain social inequalities in pedestrian,
   cyclist, and motor vehicle occupant injuries across wealthy and poor
   urban areas.
   Methods. We performed a multilevel observational study of all road users
   injured over 5 years (n = 19 568) at intersections (n = 17 498) in a
   large urban area (Island of Montreal, Canada). We considered
   intersection-level (traffic estimates, major roads, number of legs) and
   area-level (population density, commuting travel modes, household
   income) characteristics in multilevel Poisson regressions that nested
   intersections in 506 census tracts.
   Results. There were significantly more injured pedestrians, cyclists,
   and motor vehicle occupants at intersections in the poorest than in the
   richest areas. Controlling for traffic volume, intersection geometry,
   and pedestrian and cyclist volumes greatly attenuated the event rate
   ratios between intersections in the poorest and richest areas for
   injured pedestrians (-70\%), cyclists (-44\%), and motor vehicle
   occupants (-44\%).
   Conclusions. Roadway environment can explain a substantial portion of
   the excess rate of road traffic injuries in the poorest urban areas. (Am

Abstract = {{New security devices based on innovative technologies and ideas are
   essential in order to limit counterfeiting's profound impact on our
   economy and society. Interference security image structures have been in
   circulation for more than 20 years, but commercially available
   iridescent products now represent a potential threat. Therefore, the
   introduction of active materials, such as electrochromic WO3, to
   present-day optical security devices offers interesting possibilities.
   We have previously proposed electrochromic interference filters based on
   porous and dense WO3, which possessed an angle-dependent and
   voltage-driven color shift. However, the low index contrast required
   filters with a high number of layers. In this article, we increase the
   index contrast (0.61) by mixing WO3 with SiO2 and study the physical and
   electrochromic properties of mixtures. We next combine high and low
   index films in tandem configurations to observe the bleaching/coloration
   dynamics. To account for the film performance, we propose a simple
   explanation based on the differences in electron diffusion coefficients.
   An 11 layer electrochromic interference filter (EIF) based on the
   alternation of pure WO3 and (WO3)(0.17)(SiO2)(0.83) films with a blue to
   purple angular color shift is then presented. Finally, we discuss
   possible applications of these EIFs for security. (C) 2012 Optical

Abstract = {{Cooperation between multiple autonomous vehicles requires inter-vehicle
   communication, which in many scenarios must be established over an
   ad-hoc wireless network. This paper proposes an optimization-based
   approach to the deployment of such mobile robotic networks. A
   primal-dual gradient descent algorithm jointly optimizes the
   steady-state positions of the robots based on the specification of a
   high-level task in the form of a potential field, and routes packets
   through the network to support the communication rates desired for the
   application. The motion planning and communication objectives are
   tightly coupled since the link capacities depend heavily on the relative
   distances between vehicles. The algorithm decomposes naturally into two
   components, one for position optimization and one for communication
   optimization, coupled via a set of Lagrange multipliers. Crucially and
   in contrast to previous work, our method can rely on on-line evaluation
   of the channel capacities during deployment instead of a prespecified
   model. In this case, a randomized sampling scheme along the trajectories
   allows the robots to implement the algorithm with minimal coordination
   overhead.}},

Volume = {{203}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Seroma formation after axillary dissection remains the most
   common early sequel to breast cancer surgery. Different surgical
   approaches have been performed to reduce seroma collection. Therefore,
   we aimed to assess the outcome of patients operated on using an
   ultrasound scalpel according to a standardized operative technique
   before accepting it as a routine procedure.
   METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was designed to compare the
   outcome of patients undergoing breast surgery and axillary dissection
   using either standard scalpel blades, scissors, ligations, and
   electrocautery or the ultrasound scalpel only. Each arm of the trial
   consisted of 30 patients.
   RESULTS: A statistically significant benefit in terms of axillary and
   chest wall drainage volume, the number of axilla seromas, intraoperative
   bleeding, and hospitalization stay was recorded in the harmonic scalpel
   group. No significant differences were found between the 2 groups in
   terms of operative time. Finally, no postoperative hematoma, wound
   infections, and chest wall seroma were observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: The use of the harmonic scalpel was shown to reduce the
   magnitude of seromas in axilla and hospitalization stay. The harmonic
   scalpel can be used alone in axillary dissection with a safe and
   effective hemostasis. Our results must be confirmed by larger series.

Abstract = {{Hip resurfacing (HR) is a highly attractive option for young and active
   patients. Some surgeons have advocated cementing the metaphyseal stem of
   the femoral component to improve fixation and survivorship of HR.
   However, extending component fixation to the metaphysis may promote
   femoral head strain shielding, which in turn may reduce survival of the
   femoral component. Replacing the metallic metaphyseal stem by a
   composite material with bone-matching properties could help to alleviate
   this phenomenon. This study uses finite element analysis to examine the
   strain state in the femoral head for three types of implant fixation: an
   unfixed metallic stem, an osseointegrated biomimetic stem and a cemented
   metallic stem. Bone remodeling is also simulated to evaluate long-term
   bone resorption due to strain shielding. Results show that the unfixed
   stem causes strain shielding in the femoral head, and that cementing the
   stem increases strain shielding. The biomimetic stem does not eliminate
   the strain shielding effect, but reduces it significantly versus the
   metallic cemented version. The current finite element study suggests
   that an osseointegrated metaphyseal stem made of biomimetic material in
   hip resurfacing implants could become an interesting alternative when
   fixation extension is desired. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by

Title = {{Are transit users loyal? Revelations from a hazard model based on smart
   card data}},

Volume = {{39}},

Pages = {{610-618}},

Abstract = {{Smart card fare collection systems for public transit produce a huge
   quantity of data on a daily basis. The ability to follow the use of a
   single card throughout the months gives the opportunity of measuring the
   loyalty of the individual to the service. Then, operators can have
   quantitative knowledge of the loyalty in their network. However, it is
   also important to know what are the factors that influence the survival
   of the users. This paper presents the application of a discrete time
   hazard model to 5 years of data of a medium-size transit authority in
   Canada. The concept of the hazard model relates to the fact that the
   probability to continue the use of a smart card by user i, at time t, is
   conditional to the probability of not cancelling the card before the
   time period. Hence, its use is appropriate in this case. Results for the
   regular adult fare show that loyalty is positively influenced by
   residential density and by the transit share in the area. A younger
   population will also be retained longer in the system. However, a high
   unemployment rate has a negative impact on survival. A high share of
   transit and walk trips is also affecting the loyalty, suggesting that
   the retention is reduced when there are more mode choices available to
   the commuter.}},

Abstract = {{The gravity-driven free surface flow problems for which both the solid

   computation of the free surface profile, velocity and pressure
   distributions, and the flow rate of a 2D gravity fluid flow through a
   conduit and under a radial gate. The problem involves two highly curved
   unknown free surfaces and arbitrary curved-shaped boundaries. These
   features make the problem more complicated than flow under a sluice gate
   or over a weir. The fluid is assumed to be inviscid and incompressible
   and the results obtained are confirmed by conducting a hydraulic model
   test. The results are in agreement with other flow solutions for free
   surface profiles and pressure distributions.}},

   a giant nonlinear refractive index n(2) similar or equal to 10(-7) cm(2)
   W-1, almost 9 orders of magnitude larger than bulk dielectrics. We find
   that the nonlinear refractive index decreases with increasing excitation

   a very promising nonlinear medium, paving the way for graphene-based

Abstract = {{The objective of this computational study was to compare the
   biomechanical effects of different implant densities in terms of curve
   reduction and the force levels at the implant-vertebra interface and on
   the intervertebral elements.
   Eight cases were randomly picked among patients who have undergone a
   posterior spinal instrumentation for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis
   (AIS). For each case, two computer simulations were performed, one with
   the actual surgery implant pattern and another with the same fusion
   levels but an alternative implant pattern proposed by an experienced
   surgeon. The two implant patterns for each case were respectively put
   into higher and lower implant density group. The spinal correction and
   the force levels at bone-implant interface and on the intervertebral
   elements were analyzed and compared between the two groups.
   There were on average 13\% more pedicle screws and 30\% more bilaterally
   placed pedicle screws in the higher versus lower density group. The
   difference in the density of screws (92\% vs. 79\%) did not lead to
   significant difference in terms of the resulting main thoracic (MT) Cobb
   angle, and the MT apical axial vertebral rotation. The average and
   maximum implant-vertebra force levels were about 50 and 65\%,
   respectively higher in the higher versus lower density group, but
   without consistent distribution patterns. The average intervertebral
   forces did not significantly differ between the two groups.
   With the same fusion levels, lower density screws allowed achieving
   similar deformity correction and it was more likely to have lower
   screw-vertebra loads.}},

Abstract = {{A circular polarizer is a single layer or multi-layer structure that
   converts linearly polarized waves into circularly polarized ones and

   This technique is more flexible than those previously presented in the
   way that it permits to design polarizers with the desired spacing
   between layers, while obtaining surfaces that may be easier to fabricate
   and less sensitive to fabrication errors. As an illustrating example, a
   modified version of the meander-line polarizer being twice as thin as
   its conventional counterpart is designed. Then, both polarizers are

Abstract = {{Data (un)availability and uncertainty are recurring problems in life
   cycle assessment, and particularly inventory analysis. Advances in life
   cycle inventory have focused on the propagation and management of
   uncertainty, but this article addresses the question of how to account
   for unavailable data and corresponding uncertainty. Large and
   complicated systems often lack complete data due to confidential
   practices or the efforts required in the data collection process.
   Electricity production with multiple processes generating a single
   product is a classic example. Instead of the conventional process-based
   models to estimate missing data, the approach developed in this article
   divides systems based on functionally equivalent objects. Each one of
   these objects is then described in terms of characteristic variables,
   such as power capacity. Kriging, a flexible statistical estimator,
   allows for the estimation of unknown material and energy flows based on
   the objects characteristic variables. Both univariate and multivariate
   kriging are tested and compared to regression analysis. It is found that
   kriging performs better than linear regression, according to the mean
   absolute error criterion. Multivariate kriging provides an even more
   accurate joint estimation method to bridge data gaps scattered across
   inventories and when observable values of material and energy flows
   differ from one object to the next. Parameters of the underlying models
   are interpreted in terms of data uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{A combination of thermodynamic modeling and experimental studies is used
   to characterize NiO-containing oxide systems at high temperature of
   interest to nickel pyrometallurgical processes. This is part of an
   on-going research project to develop a self-consistent multi-component
   thermodynamic database. A literature review and critical assessment of
   the previously published thermodynamic and phase equilibrium data on the
   NiO-containing binary systems CaO-NiO, MgO-NiO and NiO-SiO2 at a total
   pressure of 1 atm have been performed using thermodynamic modeling.
   Considerable discrepancies among previously available experimental data
   have been found for the CaO-NiO and MgO-NiO systems. To resolve the
   contradictions in the literature data, a new experimental investigation
   has been carried out using an equilibration and quenching technique
   followed by electron probe X-ray microanalysis (EPMA). The CaO-NiO phase
   diagram in air has been measured from 1200 to 1600 degrees C. The
   equilibrium between the MgO-NiO solid solution, metal alloy and gas
   phase has been studied over the temperature range from 1000 to 1300
   degrees C, which enabled the activity of NiO to be calculated. The whole
   set of experimental data, including the new experimental results and
   previously published data, has been taken into consideration in
   thermodynamic modeling of oxide phases in the CaO-NiO, MgO-NiO and
   NiO-SiO2 systems at a total pressure of 1 atm. The Modified
   Quasichemical Model has been used for modeling of the liquid phase. A
   simple random mixing model with a polynomial expansion of the excess
   Gibbs energy has been used for the monoxide solid solution. The
   optimized model parameters reproduce all available thermodynamic and
   phase diagram data within experimental error limits. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The wall shear stress and the vortex dynamics in a circular impinging
   jet are investigated experimentally for Re = 1,260 and 2,450. The wall
   shear stress is obtained at different radial locations from the
   stagnation point using the polarographic method. The velocity field is
   given from the time resolved particle image velocimetry (TRaEuroPIV)
   technique in both the free jet region and near the wall in the impinging
   region. The distribution of the momentum thickness is also inspected
   from the jet exit toward the impinged wall. It is found that the wall
   shear stress is correlated with the large-scale vortex passing. Both the
   primary vortices and the secondary structures strongly affect the
   variation of the wall shear stress. The maximum mean wall shear stress
   is obtained just upstream from the secondary vortex generation where the
   primary structures impinge the wall. Spectral analysis and
   cross-correlations between the wall shear stress fluctuations show that
   the vortex passing influences the wall shear stress at different
   locations simultaneously. Analysis of cross-correlations between
   temporal fluctuations of the wall shear stress and the transverse
   vorticity brings out the role of different vortical structures on the
   wall shear stress distribution for the two Reynolds numbers.}},

Abstract = {{A direct modeling of colloidal suspensions consists of calculating

   Fokker-Planck-like equation. The difficulty encountered on this route is
   the high dimensionality of the space in which the distribution function
   is defined. A novel strategy is used to solve numerically the
   Fokker-Planck equation circumventing the curse of dimensionality issue.
   Rheological and morphological predictions of the model that includes
   both direct and hydrodynamic interactions are presented in different

Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to determine the effect of a long sludge
   retention time on the biodegradation of the endogenous residue in
   membrane digestion units receiving a daily feed of sludge and operated
   under either aerobic or intermittently aerated (22 h off-2 h on)
   conditions. The mixed liquor for these experiments was generated in a
   10.4 day sludge retention time membrane bioreactor fed with a synthetic
   and completely biodegradable influent with acetate as the sole carbon
   source. It had uniform characteristics and consisted of only two
   components, heterotrophic biomass X-H and endogenous residue X-E.
   Membrane digestion unit experiments were conducted for 80 days without
   any sludge wastage except for some sampling. The dynamic behaviour of
   generation and consumption of filtered organic digestion products was
   characterized in the membrane digestion unit systems using three pore
   filter sizes. Results from this investigation indicated that the
   colloidal matter with size between 0.04 mu m and 0.45 mu m was shown to
   contain a recalcitrant fraction possibly composed of polysaccharides
   bound to proteins which accumulated in the membrane digestion unit under
   both conditions. Modelling the membrane digestion unit results by
   considering a first-order decay of the endogenous residue allowed to
   determine values of the endogenous residue decay rate of 0.0065 and
   0.0072 d(-1) under fully aerobic and intermittently aerated conditions,
   respectively. The effect of temperature on the endogenous decay rate was
   assessed for the intermittently aerated conditions in batch tests using
   thickened sludge from tests gave an endogenous decay rate constant of
   0.0075 d(-1) at 20 degrees C and an Arrhenius temperature correction
   factor of 1.033. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We surveyed four different river systems in the Greater Montreal region,
   upstream and downstream of entry points of contamination, from April
   2007 to January 2009. The studied compounds belong to three different
   groups: PPCPs (caffeine, carbamazepine, naproxen, gemfibrozil, and
   trimethoprim), hormones (progesterone, estrone, and estradiol), and
   triazine herbicides and their metabolites (atrazine, deethylatrazine,
   deisopropylatrazine, simazine, and cyanazine). In the system A. B, and C
   having low flow rate and high TOC, we observed the highest detection
   frequencies and mass flows of PPCPs compared to the other compounds,
   reflecting discharge of urban contaminations through WWTPs and CSOs.
   However, in River D, having high flow rate and low TOC, comparable
   frequency of detection of triazine and their by-products and PPCPs,
   reflecting cumulative loads of these compounds from the Great Lakes as
   well as persistency against natural attenuation processes. Considering
   large differences in the removal efficiencies of caffeine and
   carbamazepine, a high ratio of caffeine/carbamazepine might be an
   indicative of a greater proportion of raw sewage versus treated
   wastewater in surface waters. In addition, caffeine appeared to be a
   promising indicator of recent urban fecal contaminations, as shown by
   the significant correlation with FC (R-2 = 0.45), while carbamazepine is
   a good indicator of cumulative persistence compounds. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Lead telluride-based materials demonstrate the highest thermoelectric
   performance in the temperature range from 200A degrees C to 400A degrees
   C, and they are of interest for numerous waste heat recovery
   applications. Unfortunately, these conventionally grown materials are
   usually very brittle, which results in significant material loss during
   module manufacturing and a decrease in module reliability when subjected
   to continuous vibrations common for automotive applications. We present
   a hot extrusion process developed for the first time for PbTe which
   yields polycrystalline materials with strong mechanical properties
   combined with high thermoelectric performance. -Type lead telluride was
   extruded from conventionally synthesized and powdered material at
   temperatures in the range of 450A degrees C to 520A degrees C depending
   on material stoichiometry. The extruded rods were of cylindrical shape
   with 2.54 cm diameter and lengths up to 40 cm. Young's modulus measured
   using mechanical spectroscopy varied from 59 GPa to 51 GPa for
   temperatures in the range of 20A degrees C to 300A degrees C. Slicing
   and dicing of extruded rods to obtain cubical samples with 2 mm side
   demonstrated no difficulties, illustrating the material homogeneity and
   its potential for manufacturing module legs. The microstructure of the
   material was studied by scanning electron microscopy. Doping with
   antimony iodide during the milling process controls the conduction
   electron concentration in the range from 1 x 10(19) cm(-3) to 6 x 10(19)
   cm(-3). For optimized doping of 0.08 wt.\% SbI3, the maximum
   thermoelectric figure of merit () reaches a value of 0.99 at 380A
   degrees C, as measured by the Harman method. The combination of high
   thermoelectric performance and improved fracture toughness makes this
   novel hot-extruded polycrystalline PbTe material highly competitive for
   many applications.}},

Abstract = {{We present a comparison of different surface preparation techniques for
   hot-extruded (Bi1- Sb )(2)(Te1- Se )(3) alloys prior to Ni plating and
   their consequences on adhesion. The surface preparation is carried out
   by a relatively fast and well-controlled electrochemical etching
   procedure that provides morphologies with homogeneous flat surfaces on a
   scale of tens of micrometers. This procedure is not optimal for Ni
   metallization since it does not ensure enough roughness on the surface.
   Applying wet chemical etching with hypochlorite and nitric acid after
   the electrochemical etching changes the morphology, and the surface
   roughness increases, as evidenced by scanning electron microscopy and
   atomic force microscopy. Tensile tests carried out on -type and -type
   1-mm-thick specimens, covered with a 12-m Ni layer followed by Sn-Pb
   soldered joints, confirm a significant improvement in the ultimate
   adhesion strength, with fracture occurring within the thermoelectric
   material. Use of this two-step surface treatment, after slicing and
   prior to metallization, leads to maximum adhesion strength of around 38
   MPa for either type of thermoelectric material. These results are
   consistent with the morphological changes observed by scanning electron
   microscopy on the surface after chemical etching.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical and analytical study of natural convection in a vertical
   porous cavity filled with a non-Newtonian binary fluid is presented. The
   density variation is taken into account by the Boussinesq approximation.
   A power-law model is used to characterize the non-Newtonian fluid
   behavior. Neumann boundary conditions for temperature are applied to the
   vertical walls of the enclosure, while the two horizontal ones are
   assumed impermeable and insulated. Both double-diffusive convection (a =
   0) and Soret-induced convection (a = 1) are considered. Scale analysis
   is presented for the two extreme cases of heat-driven and solute-driven
   natural convection. For convection in a thin vertical layer (Lambda >>
   1), a semianalytical solution for the stream function, temperature, and
   solute fields, Nusselt and Sherwood numbers are obtained using a
   parallel flow approximation in the core region of the cavity and an
   integral form of the energy and constituent equations. Numerical results
   of the full governing equations show the effects of the governing
   parameters, namely the thermal Rayleigh number, RT, the Lewis number,
   Le, the buoyancy ratio, f, the power-law index, n, and the integer
   number a. Lambda good agreement between the analytical predictions and
   the numerical simulations is obtained. (C) 2012 American Institute of

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF KNEE SURGERY}},

Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{85-97}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In the knee joint, the purpose of the cartilage-bone interface is to
   maintain structural integrity of the osteochondral unit during walking,
   kneeling, pivoting, and jumping-during which tensile, compressive, and
   shear forces are transmitted from the viscoelastic articular cartilage
   layer to the much stiffer mineralized end of the long bone. Mature
   articular cartilage is integrated with subchondral bone through a
   similar to 20 to similar to 250 mu m thick layer of calcified cartilage.
   Inside the calcified cartilage layer, perpendicular chondrocyte-derived
   collagen type II fibers become structurally cemented to collagen type I
   osteoid deposited by osteoblasts. The mature mineralization front is
   delineated by a thin similar to 5 mu m undulating tidemark structure
   that forms at the base of articular cartilage. Growth plate cartilage is
   anchored to epiphyseal bone, sometimes via a thin layer of calcified
   cartilage and tidemark, while the hypertrophic edge does not form a
   tidemark and undergoes continual vascular invasion and endochondral
   ossification (EO) until skeletal maturity upon which the growth plates
   are fully resorbed and replaced by bone. In this review, the formation
   of the cartilage-bone interface during skeletal development and
   cartilage repair, and its structure and composition are presented.
   Animal models and human anatomical studies show that the tidemark is a
   dynamic structure that forms within a purely collagen type II-positive
   and collagen type I-negative hyaline cartilage matrix. Cartilage repair
   strategies that elicit fibrocartilage, a mixture of collagen type I and
   type II, are predicted to show little tidemark/calcified cartilage
   regeneration and to develop a less stable repair tissue-bone interface.
   The tidemark can be regenerated through a bone marrow-driven growth
   process of EO near the articular surface.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce MMTrack (max-margin tracker), a single-target tracker that
   linearly combines constant and adaptive appearance features. We frame
   offline single-camera tracking as a structured output prediction task
   where the goal is to find a sequence of locations of the target given a
   video. Following recent advances in machine learning, we
   discriminatively learn tracker parameters by first generating suitable
   bad trajectories and then employing a margin criterion to learn how to
   distinguish among ground truth trajectories and all other possibilities.
   Our framework for tracking is general, and can be used with a variety of
   features. We demonstrate a system combining a variety of appearance
   features and a motion model, with the parameters of these features
   learned jointly in a coherent learning framework. Further, taking
   advantage of a reliable human detector, we present a natural way of
   extending our tracker to a robust detection and tracking system. We
   apply our framework to pedestrian tracking and experimentally
   demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on two real-world data sets,
   achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art tracking systems. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper presents a fully automated numerical tool for computing the
   accurate effective properties of two-phase linearly elastic composites
   reinforced by randomly distributed spherical particles. Virtual
   microstructures were randomly generated by an algorithm based on
   molecular dynamics. Composites effective properties were computed using
   a technique based on Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT). The predictions of
   the numerical tool were compared to those of analytical homogenization
   models for a broad range of phases mechanical properties contrasts and
   spheres volume fractions. It is found that none of the tested analytical
   models provides accurate estimates for the whole range of contrasts and
   volume fractions tested. Furthermore, no analytical homogenization
   models stands out of the others as being more accurate for the
   investigated range of volume fractions and contrasts. The new fully
   automated tool provides a unique means for computing, once and for all,
   the accurate properties of composites over a broad range of
   microstructures. In due course, the database generated with this tool
   might replace analytical homogenization models. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In the biomedical field, nanomaterials have the potential for use in the
   targeted delivery of drugs in the human body and in the diagnosis and
   therapy of certain diseases. In the category of targeted delivery,
   magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles have received much attention. As with
   any similar new therapy, when such nanoparticles are functionalized with
   chemical groups designed to permit the specific attachment of drugs,
   cytotoxicological testing is necessary before moving to animal models.
   Here, we consider several variously functionalized magnetite
   nanoparticles, including those prepared with (1) a monolayer of oleic
   acid (Fe3O4@OA), which is subsequently converted to (2) a shell of
   amine-containing silane (Fe3O4@NH2), (3) a shell of silica (Fe3O4@SiO2),
   and (4) a shell of amine-containing silane over a shell of silica
   (Fe3O4@SiO2@NH2). These latter three functionalities were evaluated for
   biocompatibility, cellular morphology, mitochondrial function (MTT
   assay), lactate dehydrogenase membrane leakage (LDH assay), and
   proinflammatory potential through enzyme linked immunosorbent assay
   (ELISA) for interleukin 6 (IL-6). Controlled tests were performed over a
   period of 72 h, with results showing LDH leakage and abnormal Il-6
   secretion at high concentrations (>50 mu g/mL). The tests showed that,
   in addition to the surface characteristics of the nanoparticles, both
   the nutrient medium and the time of suspension before exposure to cells
   also contribute to nanoparticle cytotoxicity. (C) 2012 Wiley

   (RF) sinusoid directly drives the De-MZM to obtain optical subcarrier
   modulation with optical carrier suppression. By carefully setting the
   physical parameters, the generated harmonics of optical intensity can be
   corresponding to the Fourier components of typical periodic triangular
   pulses. Numerical simulations reveal that modulation index must be set
   to 2.305 and bias voltage drift must be within a range from -25\% -15\%
   from the minimum transmission of the De-MZM. In addition, the dispersion
   must be set correctly to suppress the primary distortion of 4th order

Abstract = {{In this study, we report a comprehensive structural and
   photoluminescence (PL) study on lithium metasilicate (Li2SiO3) phosphor
   ceramics doped with four rare earth (RE) ions. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
   patterns show a dominant phase, characteristic of the orthorhombic
   structure Li2SiO3 compound and the presence of dopants has no effect on
   the basic crystal structure of the material. The first excited state
   Er3+ luminescence at 1.54 mu m arises from a sharp atomic-like radiative
   transition between the I-4(13/2) state and the I-4(15/2) state (ground
   level) under a 532 nm line of an Ar ion laser excitation. Sm doped
   samples showed Sm3+ emission characteristics corresponding to the some
   (4)G(5/2) -> H-6(j) (j = 5/2.9/2,11/2) transitions indicating a strong
   crystal-field effect. PL spectra of Eu doped material exhibited peaks
   corresponding to the D-5(0) -> F-7(j) (j similar or equal to 0,1,2,3 and
   4) transitions under 405 nm excitation. The dominant red color emission
   at 612 nm from the hypersensitive (D-5(0) -> F-7(2)) transition of Eu3+
   indicates the inversion antisymmetry crystal field around Eu3+ ion,
   which is favorable to improve the red color purity. Dy doped samples
   showed the Dy3+ emission characteristic due to the F-4(9/2) -> H-6(13/2)
   transition. Their relative intensity ratios also suggested the presence
   of a symmetric environment around the metal ion. We suggest that lithium
   metasilicate has enough potential candidates to be a phosphor material.

Abstract = {{We propose a new approach to construct adaptive multiscale orthonormal
   (AMO) bases of R-N that provide highly sparse signal representations.
   Our new multilayer AMO basis design produces a high proportion of small
   scale vectors. The basis vectors are built from small scale to large
   scales, layer by layer. For each layer, the basis vector maximizes a
   p-norm measure of sparsity. We compare the sparsity ratios SR (i.e. the
   percentage of negligibly small coefficients) obtained with AMO and
   Daubechies wavelet bases for seven families of piecewise smooth signals
   with randomly located discontinuities. The signals are composed of
   polynomial, sinusoidal and exponential pieces. In all cases, AMO bases
   produce a SR increase ranging from 6\% to 37\%. AMO bases have three
   main advantages over wavelets. First, they are found automatically by
   solving a sequence of optimization problems, which eliminates the
   problem of selecting a wavelet for a given signal. Second, they can
   provide a significantly sparser representation. Finally, they have the
   ability to produce zero coefficients for a larger family of piecewise
   smooth signals. The drawbacks of AMO bases are computational: the basis
   computation is more expensive, the basis vectors require storage space
   and no fast transform is known. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Antipatterns are poor design choices that are conjectured to make
   object-oriented systems harder to maintain. We investigate the impact of
   antipatterns on classes in object-oriented systems by studying the
   relation between the presence of antipatterns and the change- and
   fault-proneness of the classes. We detect 13 antipatterns in 54 releases
   of ArgoUML, Eclipse, Mylyn, and Rhino, and analyse (1) to what extent
   classes participating in antipatterns have higher odds to change or to
   be subject to fault-fixing than other classes, (2) to what extent these
   odds (if higher) are due to the sizes of the classes or to the presence
   of antipatterns, and (3) what kinds of changes affect classes
   participating in antipatterns. We show that, in almost all releases of
   the four systems, classes participating in antipatterns are more
   change-and fault-prone than others. We also show that size alone cannot
   explain the higher odds of classes with antipatterns to underwent a
   (fault-fixing) change than other classes. Finally, we show that
   structural changes affect more classes with antipatterns than others. We
   provide qualitative explanations of the increase of change- and
   fault-proneness in classes participating in antipatterns using release
   notes and bug reports. The obtained results justify a posteriori
   previous work on the specification and detection of antipatterns and
   could help to better focus quality assurance and testing activities.}},

Abstract = {{We study the benefits of coordination between two adjacent stages in a
   production system. A set of jobs specific to the customers' demand are
   processed in a planning horizon. Each job is characterized by its
   processing times in both stages and a due date. Once a job is processed
   in the first stage it enters a buffer where it may be moved to a
   specific location; when all jobs are processed in the buffer, the second
   stage commences its operations. The objective of the first stage is to
   minimize the inventory cost measured by the sum of completion time, and
   that of the second stage is to minimize the tardiness cost and the
   resequencing cost in the buffer. The stages prefer schedules that
   minimize their respective objective functions. The performance of the
   system is measured by the sum of the costs associated at both stages. We
   evaluate each stage's cost of conflict as the relative increase in its
   cost as a result of using the other stage's optimal schedule. We analyze
   the computational tractability of the individual stage's problems and
   the system problem, demonstrating that the system problem is NP-hard and
   that individual problems can be solved in polynomial time. We designed a
   Genetic Algorithm based on the idea of nondominated sorting for solving
   the system problem. The GA provided ideal solutions quickly, and
   numerical studies reveal that the cost saving provided by the
   coordinated schedule between both stages is usually significant.
   Coordination is possible between stages due to this cost saving.
   Finally, we briefly discuss the implications on our work for how both
   stages negotiate, coordinate, and implement their supply chain schedules
   in practice. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   highlights the role of propagating monolayer edges in the entropy-driven
   atom swapping and demonstrates that substitution of Si by Ge is a

Abstract = {{A parallel sliding mesh algorithm for the finite element simulation of
   viscous fluid flows in agitated tanks is presented. Lagrange multipliers
   are used at the sliding interfaces to enforce the continuity between the
   fixed and moving subdomains. The novelty of the method consists of the
   coupled solution of the resulting velocitypressure-Lagrange multipliers
   system of equations by an ILU(0)-QMR solver. A penalty parameter is
   introduced for both the interface and the incompressibility constraints
   to avoid pivoting problems in the ILU(0) algorithm. To handle the
   convective term, both the NewtonRaphson scheme and the semi-implicit
   linearization are tested. A penalty parameter is introduced for both the
   interface and the incompressibility constraints to avoid the failure of
   the ILU(0) algorithm due to the lack of pivoting. Furthermore, this
   approach is versatile enough so that it allows partitioning of sliding
   and fixed subdomains if parallelization is required. Although the
   sliding mesh technique is fairly common in CFD, the main advantage of
   the proposed approach is its low computational cost due to the
   inexpensive and parallelizable calculations that involve preconditioned
   sparse iterative solvers. The method is validated for Couette and
   coaxial stirred tanks. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{High power pulsed magnetron sputtering is being intensively explored as
   a very promising approach for the fabrication of functional coatings
   with enhanced performance. However, a direct comparison of the results
   obtained in different systems is complicated given the variety of pulse
   power supplies with different pulse shape, voltage and current
   characteristics. In this study, we systematically investigate and
   compare sputtering processes above a niobium target operated in the same
   reactor using two commercially available power supplies: (i) a shorter
   (200 mu s) square voltage pulse generator permitting higher cathode
   voltage values, and (ii) a modulated pulse power generator with longer
   (800-300 mu s) custom-shaped pulses. In addition, target sputtering
   using a conventional DC power supply is also analyzed for comparison
   purposes. The pulsed discharges are characterized by time-resolved
   current and voltage probes and optical emission spectroscopy. The
   deposition rate, the microstructure, and the mechanical stress of the
   fabricated Nb coatings are evaluated and compared. Finally, the effect
   of the power delivery management is discussed in terms of discharge
   characteristics and coating properties. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{It is known that surface-plasmon resonances of metallic nanoparticles
   can significantly enhance the field experienced by semiconductor quantum
   dots. In this paper we show that, when quantum dots are in the vicinity
   of metallic nanoparticles and interact with coherent light sources
   (laser fields), coherent exciton-plasmon coupling (quantum coherence
   effects) can increase the amount of the plasmonic field enhancement
   significantly. We also study how the coherent molecular resonances
   generated by such a coupling process are influenced by the
   self-renormalization of the plasmonic fields and the structural
   parameters of the systems, particularly the size and shape of the
   metallic nanoparticle. The renormalization process happens via mutual
   impacts of the radiative decay rate of excitons and the coherent
   exciton-plasmon coupling on each other. Our results highlight the
   conditions where the molecular resonances become very sharp, offering
   optical switching processes with high extinction ratio and wide ranging
   device applications.}},

Abstract = {{The development of nanoplasmonic sensing approaches for DNA detection
   based on the localized plasmonic properties of different metallic NPs
   fabricated by femtosecond laser ablation with an application for
   synthetic oligonucleotides as specific probes for genetic sequence

   technique has been used to test oligonucleotide probes specific to rpoB
   genes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Optimal experimental conditions
   providing efficiency of hybridization between immobilized probe and cDNA
   target and performance of the SPR method were obtained and applied to
   the nanoplasmonic biosensing based on colloidal nanoparticles. Gold and
   silver/gold alloy nanoparticles were fabricated by the ``pure{''} laser
   ablation method and have shown faster conjugation to thiol-modified DNA
   and higher stability in hybridization buffer than nanoparticles produced
   by chemical synthesis. Nanoparticle-enhanced and spectral SPR methods
   were used to confirm the efficiency of DNA-modified laser-generated gold
   nanoparticles in biosensing. Numerical estimation shows a higher
   sensitivity of nanoalloy materials application in dimer aggregate
   configurations. The described approaches could be proposed as a basis
   for an optical biosensor for sensitive and real-time detection of
   nucleic acid samples, for example, nucleotide sequences related to

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{99-107}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports an analytical and numerical study of natural
   convection in a shallow rectangular cavity filled with a micropolar
   fluid. Neumann boundary conditions for temperature and concentration are
   applied to the horizontal walls of the enclosure, while the two vertical
   ones are assumed insulated. The governing parameters for the problem are
   the thermal Rayleigh number, Ra, Prandtl number, Pr, Lewis number Le,
   buoyancy ratio, phi, aspect ratio of the cavity, A, and various material
   parameters of the micropolar fluid, K, B, lambda and n. For convection
   in an infinite layer (A >> 1), analytical solutions for the stream
   function, temperature, concentration and microrotation are obtained
   using a parallel flow approximation in the core region of the cavity and
   an integral form of the energy and constituent equations. The critical
   Rayleigh numbers for the onset of supercritical and subcritical
   convection are predicted explicitly by the present model. Also, results
   are obtained from the analytical model for finite amplitude convection
   for which the flow and heat transfer are presented in terms of the
   governing parameters of the problem. Numerical solutions of the full
   governing equations are reported for a wide range of the governing
   parameters. A good agreement is observed between the analytical model
   and the numerical simulations. The influence of the material parameters
   on the flow and heat and solute transfers is demonstrated to be
   significant. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamics of chemical reactions, called mass-action-law dynamics, serves
   in this paper as a motivating example for investigating geometry of
   nonlinear non-equilibrium thermodynamics and for studying the ways to
   extend a mesoscopic dynamics to more microscopic levels. The geometry in
   which the physics involved is naturally expressed appears to be the
   contact geometry. Two extensions are discussed in detail. In one, the
   reaction fluxes or forces are adopted as independent state variables,
   the other takes into account fluctuations. All the time evolution
   equations arising in the paper are proven to be compatible among
   themselves and with equilibrium thermodynamics. A quantity closely
   related to the entropy production plays in the extended dynamics with
   fluxes and forces as well as in the corresponding fluctuating dynamics
   the same role that entropy plays in the original mass-action-law
   dynamics. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A strategy based on a kinetic model was developed to control a fedbatch
   process for phenol degradation by means of the feeding pattern.
   Biodegradation of phenol by acclimated activated sludge was modeled by
   the Haldane equation. This model was considered as the control system
   and the feeding flow (Q) to the reactor as the input. The Control
   Lyapunov Function (CLF) approach was used to synthesize the controller,
   which was applied in open loop. A feeding strategy and a fedbatch cycle,
   consisting of 4h of filling, 6 h of aeration, 0.58 h of settling and
   0.03 h of drawing, were obtained by simulation. The kinetic model and
   the control strategy were validated experimentally in a fedbatch cycle,
   and the performance of the latter was compared with that of a
   non-controlled cycle. The model allowed to predict adequately both the
   phenol and the biomass concentrations during the culture. The control of
   the process resulted in a lower hydraulic retention time (21.28 h) than
   that of the non-controlled cycle (47.62 h). Higher applied and phenol
   mass loads (1.13 g phenol L-1 d(-1) and 4.82 g phenol g(-1) TSS d(-1),
   respectively) could also be obtained in the controlled cycle. Further,
   the phenol mass load was higher than that reported in other processes
   even though any online monitoring was carried out. This is the first
   reported use of the CLF approach to biodegradation processes, and it is
   our view that it could be applied to other phenolic wastewater treatment
   systems lacking of real-time monitoring. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Transition from bubbling to turbulent in a conventional gas-solid
   fluidized bed was evaluated from trajectory of particles in fluidized
   bed. A series of experiments were carried out in a lab-scale
   fluidization bed using radioactive particle tracking (RPT) technique for
   recording the position of a tracer in the bed. Statistical parameters,
   such as standard deviation and skewness of the time-position data, were
   utilized to determine the transition velocity from bubbling to turbulent
   regime. The results showed that the data obtained by the RPT technique
   can predict transition velocity. It was shown I hat the standard
   deviation of position fluctuations reach a maximum with increasing
   superficial gas velocity corresponding to regime transition. It was
   shown that transition from bubbling to turbulent car be determined using
   skewness and kurtosis of time-position data. The velocities obtained in
   this work are in good agreement with the available correlations. (C)

Abstract = {{Diffuse, optical near infrared imaging is increasingly being used in
   various neurocognitive contexts where changes in optical signals are
   interpreted through activation maps. Statistical population comparison
   of different age or clinical groups rely on the relative homogeneous
   distribution of measurements across subjects in order to infer changes
   in brain function. In the context of an increasing use of diffuse
   optical imaging with older adult populations, changes in tissue
   properties and anatomy with age adds additional confounds. Few studies
   investigated these changes with age. Duncan et al. measured the
   so-called diffusion path length factor (DPF) in a large population but
   did not explore beyond the age of 51 after which physiological and
   anatomical changes are expected to occur {[}Pediatr. Res. 39(5), 889-894
   (1996)]. With increasing interest in studying the geriatric population
   with optical imaging, we studied changes in tissue properties in young
   and old subjects using both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided
   Monte-Carlo simulations and time-domain diffuse optical imaging. Our
   results, measured in the frontal cortex, show changes in DPF that are
   smaller than previously measured by Duncan et al. in a younger
   population. The origin of these changes are studied using simulations
   and experimental measures. (C) 2012 Society of Photo-Optical

Abstract = {{Titanium oxy nitride has been fabricated for the first time from
   anhydrous Sol-gel Method and used as anode for water electrolysis in
   acid medium. It is shown that the properties of this material are highly
   dependent on the calcination temperature. The conductivity increases
   from insulator (titanium dioxide type) to metallic (titanium nitride
   type) when the calcination temperature rose from 500 degrees C to 1000
   degrees C. When the catalyst material is calcinated at 700 degrees C,
   the rutile structure of titanium dioxide is obtained and agrees well
   with those obtained with the TGA-DSC results. These results also show
   that the structure of the osbornite of titanium nitride appears at 1000
   degrees C. The BET surface area also increases with the calcination
   temperature. The morphology of the calcinated samples gradually breaks
   into smaller conchoidal fracture particles when the sample preparation
   temperature increases. Electrochemical voltage-current polarization
   curves of the oxygen evolution reaction in sulphuric acid on these
   anodes electrodes confirm that the materials calcinated at 800 degrees C
   or even at higher temperatures exhibit a low Tafel slope and a high
   electrochemistry surface area which are both known as good values for
   the oxygen evolution in acid medium. The results of this study suggest
   that our titanium oxy nitride prepared by an anhydrous sol-gel method
   followed by calcination is an interesting anode catalyst for water
   electrolysis. Its performance for this reaction is compared to those of
   some noble metal oxides. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy

Abstract = {{Vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) of a circular cylinder at low values of
   the Reynolds number (Re) are simulated by means of a fully coupled
   fluid-structure interaction numerical model based on the finite element
   method. It is shown that VIV could occur far below the first Hopf
   bifurcation (Re < 47). The main objective of this study is to determine
   the limiting curve that separates the non-vibrational area from the
   possible vibrations occurrence area in the Reynolds number-reduced
   velocity (Re, Ur) plane. We assume that by taking a zero mass cylinder
   and zero structural damping we should get the low limit of vibrations in
   terms of Re and Ur. It is shown that transverse vibrations could occur
   for reduced velocities larger than 40 and that for zero mass/no damping
   cylinders the maximum vibration amplitude for subcritical Reynolds
   numbers is obtained at Ur = 6.5. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Our recently developed model for the viscosity of borosilicate melts is
   extended to describe and predict the viscosities of melts containing
   alkali oxides. In addition to the two model parameters that are required
   for each B2O3-MOx melt, where MOx is a basic oxide, three more
   parameters are needed when MOx is an alkali oxide to account for the
   formation of clusters near the tetraborate composition. The additional
   parameters represent the size and Gibbs energy of formation of these
   clusters and their contribution to the activation energy of the viscous
   flow. A general algorithm for the calculation of the viscosity is
   presented which summarizes the application of the viscosity model to
   melts that can contain two network formers, SiO2 and B2O3, any basic
   oxide and amphoteric oxides exhibiting the Charge Compensation Effect
   such as Al2O3. The predictive ability of the model is tested on all
   ternary subsystems of the B2O3-Na2O-K2O-CaO-MgO-PbO-ZnO-Al2O3-SiO2
   system containing both an alkali oxide and B2O3 for which experimental
   data are available and on several multicomponent glass-forming melts

Abstract = {{Hard rock mine tailings are prone to liquefaction when subjected to the
   cyclic loading of earthquakes. This response may cause failure of the
   retaining dams and the release of liquefied tailings. To investigate the
   geotechnical response of tailings during cyclic loading, an experimental
   program was conducted using a physical model consisting of an
   instrumented, rigid box on a large seismic (shaking) simulator. The main
   objective of the tests performed on tailings was to assess, in a
   relative manner, their response to cyclic loads, without and with
   drainage or rigid inclusions (or a combination of both). As the results
   obtained during such tests can be significantly influenced by the
   experimental procedure, a rigorous methodology was followed for this
   experimental program. This paper presents the details of the methodology
   developed to conduct such tests, as well as some of the results
   obtained.}},

Abstract = {{To achieve a good bioactivity, magnetron-sputtered (MS) hydroxyapatite
   (HA) coatings have to be stoichiometric and crystalline. It has also
   been suggested that doping HA with metallic elements improves its
   bioactivity but frequently reduces its Young's modulus. Therefore,
   efforts are still necessary to identify adequate growth conditions, good
   doping elements and finally to grow doped HA films. In a first attempt,
   HA films have been synthesized by MS. Our conditions enabled us to grow
   at similar to 10 nm min(-1) stoichiometric and crystallized HA coatings
   that presented a strong texture. The latter is discussed in view of the
   competitive growth of the material under the strong electron and ion
   bombardments used here. Based on ab initio calculations identifying Ta
   as a promising doping element, we then investigated the growth of
   Ta-doped hydroxyapatite (HA:Ta) by magnetron co-sputtering. The HA:Ta
   films were in situ crystallized. Our data reveals that for Ta contents
   <4.5 at.\%, Ta could substitute Ca in the HA cell. For higher doping
   contents, a deviation from the stoichiometric compound is observed and
   CaO appears. By nanoindentation, we have measured an elastic modulus of
   120 +/- 9 GPa for a Ta content of 3 at.\%. This value is very close to
   the value of 110 GPa calculated by ab initio calculations, supporting
   the substitution scenario. The elasticity drop may be understood by
   screening of the ionic interaction between constituents in HA upon Ta
   incorporation. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A 24-GHz microstrip array antenna is developed on a single-layer
   electrically-thin substrate to provide a cost-effective solution for
   automotive applications. By etching two straight slots close to and
   parallel with the non-radiating edges, the impedance bandwidth of a
   conventional rectangular microstrip patch is enhanced without affecting
   its radiation characteristics. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed technique, an 8 x 8 planar array with a specified sidelobe
   level of 25 dB in both the E-plane and H-plane is studied and prototyped
   on the commercial substrate RT/duroid 5880 with a thickness of 0.25 mm.
   The measured impedance bandwidth for VSWR less than 2 is about 1.8 GHz,
   which corresponds to a relative bandwidth of 7.5\%. In addition, the
   measured gain is 22.5 dBi at the center frequency while it is higher
   than 21 dBi over a frequency band of 1 GHz. Finally, the measured

Abstract = {{The effects of delays on dynamical networks and the stability analysis
   of time delayed systems have received a notable attention over the past
   decades. In this paper, the effects of delays on the oscillatory
   properties of a neural ring networks model are considered. The existence
   of oscillations for a specific type of recurrent neural network with
   time delays between neural interconnections is investigated. By using
   Chafee's closed orbit theory, some sufficient conditions for permanent
   oscillations are obtained. Simple and practical criteria for selecting
   the range of parameters in this network model are also derived. Among
   other things, the solutions that we provide can be applied to various
   activation functions. A few computer simulations are presented to
   support our analysis. The present study can be applied to analyze under
   which conditions a ring network could be exploited as an oscillatory

Abstract = {{Substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) technology provides an effective

   Ka-band four-degree bandpass filters having asymmetric frequency
   response, which are required in the design of transmit and receive
   diplexers for high rejection between neighboring channels, are proposed
   and realized on an SIW platform. The filters are self-packaged due to
   the fact that a conductor-backed coplanar waveguide is used to directly
   excite the filters. Higher-order resonant mode is used to achieve the
   required negative coupling on the basis of a single-layer SIW. The
   proposed filters, having the same center frequency of 35 GHz and pass
   bandwidth of 1.3 GHz, are fabricated on a conventional Rogers RT/Duroid
   6002 substrate with thickness of 0.508 mm by using a low-cost printed

Abstract = {{Traveling-wave amplification along a carbon nanotube (CNT) under dc-ac
   fields is theoretically investigated. The ac conductivity of a metallic
   CNT is found with respect to the applied dc bias. For this purpose, the
   Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) is solved within the relaxation time
   approximation (RTA) by separating the ac and dc distributions. The
   problem is solved both exactly and approximately by semianalytical and
   analytical means, respectively. It is shown that an absolute negative ac
   conductivity accompanies a negative differential conductivity beyond a
   threshold dc field of 3 x 10(5) V/m. The complex propagation factor of
   the allowed surface wave modes is found by coupling the BTE current with
   Maxwell's equations and solving a transcendental equation. The slow-wave
   factor and attenuation steadily increase with the dc field amplitude.
   Beyond the threshold field, amplification occurs, which is a promising
   result toward enabling traveling-wave amplifiers using CNTs. The
   amplification is shown to be a result of Bloch-type oscillations.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new theory of two-degrees-of-freedom (2hbox - DOF) H?8
   filters as counterparts of 2-DOF controllers is presented. The theory is
   also extended to n - DOF filters which bore strong resemblance to linear
   finite-impulse-response filters and hence generalizes this class of
   filters to the nonlinear continuous-time case. Sufficient conditions for
   the solvability of the filter gains are derived in terms of new
   HamiltonJacobiIsaacs equations which do not involve the system states.
   This is an improvement over earlier results in which the filter gains
   are functions of the system states. Simulation results are also
   presented to support the theory. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons,

   irradiation of the flowing gases at reduced pressure, employing
   near-monochromatic radiation from Kr and Xe lamps. Using mixtures with
   NH3, the source of bound N in the coatings, similar concentrations,
   {[}N], can be achieved in both UV-PE(M):N and low-pressure plasma
   polymers, L-PPE:N, but the former are much richer in primary amines,
   with selectivity values ({[}NH2]/{[}N]) up to 75\%. UV-PE:N and UV-PM:N
   films prepared with gas mixture ratios, R, between 0.75 and 1.0 possess
   the main characteristics required for bio-technological applications:
   (i) NH2-rich, (ii) low loss of {[}NH2] upon exposure to atmosphere or
   water, and (iii) very low solubility in aggressive solvents, e.g.,
   water. The VUV photo-polymerization process, governed by reactions of
   free radicals from the gas-phase, appears to result in more stable, more
   densely cross-linked deposits than those from plasma-assisted processes.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To study the impact of patient-specific prone positioning on
   the sagittal and coronal curves of scoliotic spines, including the
   impact of various patient and surgical frame factors.
   Summary of Background Data: Prone operative positioning has been shown
   to impact the geometry of various individual spinal segments. Its impact
   on global spinal geometry and influential factors remains unknown.
   Methods: Lateral and coronal radiographs were acquired of 6 scoliotic
   patients while standing, prone on a dynamically adjustable surgical
   frame and intraoperatively on the Relton-Hall frame. Standing lateral
   bending radiographs were also acquired. Lordosis, kyphosis, and Cobb
   angles were measured in each position. Personalized finite element
   models (FEMs), including the spine, ribcage, pelvis, and lower limbs
   were generated for each patient based on their standing radiographs. The
   FEM's ability to reproduce prone spinal geometry was evaluated by using
   different values of intervertebral disc elastic moduli: published,
   optimized based on lateral bending radiographs and optimized based on
   prone radiographs. The 6 FEMs were then exploited to study the impact of
   surgical frame cushion configuration, standing curve magnitudes, and
   patient weight on spinal geometry changes due to prone positioning.
   Results: All coronal and sagittal curves decreased in the prone
   position; averaging 12\% in lordosis, 19\% in kyphosis, 7\%, 14\%, and
   26\%, respectively, for proximal thoracic, main thoracic, and
   thoracolumbar/lumbar Cobb angles. FEM prone simulations yielded best
   results when optimized by using the prone position radiographs (Delta <
   5 degrees for all segmental curves). Lateral bending optimization
   yielded similar results by using published properties. Surgical frame
   cushion configuration, standing curve magnitudes, and patient weight all
   had an important impact on spinal geometries with the exception of
   thoracic cushion longitudinal position. A strong correlation (R = 0.86)
   was found between standing kyphosis and its reduction in the prone
   position.
   Conclusions: Prone positioning results in a reduction of all spinal
   segmental curves which is dependent on a number of patient and surgical
   frame factors.}},

   compression temperature, while the moisture uptake rate of pellets
   decreased with increasing the severity of torrefaction. The densities of
   torrefied pellets were lower than the control pellet due to the loss of
   chemically bonded water and low-melting point compounds during
   torrefaction which act as a binding agent when softened at similar to
   100 degrees C. The properties of pellets were affected by the removal of

Abstract = {{The study of the neural basis of syntactic processing has greatly
   benefited from neuroimaging techniques. Research on syntactic processing
   in bilinguals has used a variety of techniques, including mainly
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related

   spectroscopy (fNIRS) study on syntactic processing in highly proficient
   young adult speakers of Portuguese (mother tongue) (L1) and French
   (second language) (L2). They made a syntactic judgment of visually
   presented sentences, which either did or did not contain noun-verb
   agreement violations. The results showed that syntactic processing in
   both languages resulted in significant activation in anterior frontal
   regions of the left hemisphere and in the temporal superior posterior
   areas of the right hemisphere, with a more prominent activation for L2
   in some areas. These findings corroborate previously reported
   neuroimaging evidence, showing the suitability of fNIRS for the study of
   syntactic processing in the bilingual brain. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Healthy aging is characterized by a number of changes on brain structure
   and function. Several neuroimaging studies have shown an age-related
   reduction in hemispheric asymmetry on various cognitive tasks, a
   phenomenon captured by Cabeza (2002) in the Hemispheric Asymmetry
   Reduction in Older Adults (HAROLD) model. Although this phenomenon is
   supported by a range of neuroimaging data on memory and inhibitory
   processes, there is little evidence concerning changes in hemispheric
   asymmetry for language processing, and particularly word retrieval,
   which is assessed with verbal fluency task (VFT). This study aimed to
   investigate the age-related changes in cerebral oxygenation in the
   prefrontal cortex for both letter and category VFT, varying the
   complexity of the criteria (i.e., degree of productivity) and using
   near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Sixteen younger and 16 older adults
   participated in this study. For both VF conditions, participants were
   instructed to pronounce as many nouns as possible as a function of
   high-productivity (e.g., ``animals{''} or ``L{''}) or low-productivity
   (e.g., ``flowers{''} or ``V{''}) criteria. Behavioral data (i.e.,
   accuracy responses) showed comparable performance in younger and older
   adults for both VF conditions. However, NIRS data showed more reduced
   activation (i.e., significantly reduced increase in {[}O(2)Hb] and
   reduced decrease in {[}HHb]) in older than younger adults for both VFT.
   In addition, a bilateral effect was found for both groups, suggesting
   that VFT requires both executive and language functions. The results are
   discussed in the context of the current theories of aging. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Relatively few studies have analyzed the mechanisms underlying the
   cognitive changes that affect language in the elderly, and fewer have
   done so for narrative discourse. The goal of this study was to explore
   the neurofunctional changes associated with aging for different
   components of narrative discourse. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy
   (fNIRS) and behavioral data on 10 younger adults and 10 healthy elderly
   participants were collected. Ten younger adults in a non-proficient
   second language condition were included to explore the possibility that
   the age-related neurofunctional reorganization partly expresses
   demanding resource allocation. Results show within- and
   across-hemispheric differences in the neurofunctional pattern of
   activation in the older participants with reference to the younger ones,
   partially shared with the low-proficiency young adults, providing
   support for the recognized mechanisms underlying neural reserve and
   compensation. fNIRS was shown to be appropriate for studying the
   age-related neurofunctional reorganization of complex cognitive
   abilities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a general method is presented to handle transformers in
   the backward forward sweep (BFS) based load flow analysis of unbalanced
   distribution systems. The proposed method is based on the modified

   matrix that is used for both backward and forward sweep operations. The
   matrix is constructed in a straightforward and systematic manner, and
   the proposed solution technique is not restricted to a particular
   transformer connection and can easily handle uncommon configurations,
   some of which may present modeling challenges otherwise. The transformer
   impedances are described in full three-phase ohmic values in the matrix,
   which is the state of the art in distribution system analysis. Phase
   shifts introduced by different type of transformer connections are
   automatically taken into account and neutral grounding impedances are
   explicitly represented.}},

Abstract = {{Thermoplastic olefin blends of polypropylene (PP) and ethylene octene
   copolymers (EC) were reactively compatibilized by means of functional
   reactive compounds capable of forming copolymers at the interface. For
   this purpose, amine functional groups were first incorporated into a PP
   in a solution reaction. The aminated PP was then used as the reactive
   compatibilizer during melt mixing. Linear viscoelastic measurements
   showed that the compatibilized blends feature the characteristics of
   materials in the sol-gel transition, with a power-law behavior for the
   dynamic moduli at low frequencies. The gel-like behavior was more
   pronounced in the blend with a high level of compatibilizer (10 wt. \%).
   At high frequencies, however, the dynamic properties of all the blends
   investigated (compatibilized and noncompatibilized) were identical,
   suggesting that the bulk properties of the blends were not changed by
   the reactive compatibilization. The presence of a network structure was
   also confirmed by microscopic observations. A large transient viscosity
   with a significant and broad overshoot was observed for the
   compatibilized blends at low shear rate. In addition, the stress of the
   compatibilized blends relaxed over a much longer time as compared to the
   noncompatibilized system. The ability of different linear viscoelastic
   models in predicting the linear viscoelastic behavior of the
   compatibilized blends was also examined. (C) 2012 The Society of

Abstract = {{As member of the Generation IV International Forum (GIF), Canada has
   decided to orient its efforts towards the design of a CANDU-type
   SuperCritical Water-cooled nuclear Reactor (SCWR). Such a system must
   run at a coolant outlet temperature of about 625 degrees C and at a
   pressure of 25 MPa. Even though several steam-cycle arrangements used in
   existing thermal-power plants have been discussed by many authors, none
   of the proposed cycles have been optimized and adapted to the
   pressure-channel SCWR concept. The present work is intended to fulfil
   this gap by including at least two alternative solutions of SCWR power
   cycles that could reheat the supercritical water in the reactor core to
   achieve a net mechanical power of 1200-MW. Thus, thermodynamic models
   for preselected power cycles, their validation among existing data as
   well as their optimization using an ``evolutionary optimization{''}
   technique based on genetic algorithms are presented and discussed. (C)

Abstract = {{This letter reports the application of turnaround-point (TAP)

   realized using the CO2 laser-writing technique. After a Co-60 gamma dose
   of 6 kGy, the TAP-LPGs show a radiation-induced shift of more than 35 nm
   for each of the dual resonance dips, which is the highest shift reported
   to date for any type of fiber gratings. These LPGs can therefore be used
   as radiation sensors down to doses of a few Gy with modest
   wavelength-resolving instrumentation. The LPGs show significant
   sensitivity of wavelength shifts up to 80 nm for a dose of 65 kGy. We
   attribute the very high radiation sensitivity to near-TAP operation and
   doping of Boron in the fiber. This should open up applications of LPGs
   to radiation dosimetry.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, a multilayered substrate integrated waveguide (SIW)
   Butler matrix beam-forming network is proposed, designed, and
   demonstrated at 24 GHz for automotive radar system applications. The
   proposed low-cost SIW structure can be used to develop a highly
   integrated multibeam antenna platform in automotive radar systems and
   other applications. In this structure, an SIW H-plane coupler is
   optimized with an H-plane slit to provide the required phase shift. A
   class of SIW E-plane 3-dB couplers in doubled layer substrate are
   studied and designed as the fundamental building blocks to avoid
   crossovers usually required in the construction of a Butler matrix. A 4
   x 4 matrix is investigated and designed, which shows excellent
   performance over 2226 GHz frequency band. Two types of antenna are
   tested with the proposed matrix scheme. First, an antipodal linearly
   tapered slot antenna (ALTSA) is incorporated into the Butler matrix to
   verify the broadband performances. Second, a longitudinal slotted
   waveguide antenna array is examined to generate radiation patterns in
   the broadside direction. Measured results agree well with simulated
   counterparts, thus validating the proposed multilayer SIW design
   concepts. In the next sections, the use as feeding networks for
   providing the reconfigurability operation of an antenna will be
   illustrated. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Int J RF and Microwave CAE

Abstract = {{A technique to design wideband coplanar waveguide bandpass filters is
   reported. The filter is realized by etching a slot on the ground plane
   around a gap on its central conductor and modifying the gap in the form
   of parallel lines. It is shown that the 3-dB fractional bandwidth of the
   filter can be varied from 60 to 110\% by tuning the size of the slot
   aperture and the length of the parallel lines. Equivalent circuit and
   design steps are presented. Implementation area of the filter having
   passband 3.210.5 GHz is 0.90 ?g x 0.26 ?g, ?g being the guided
   wavelength at 6.85 GHz while 20-dB stopband is at least up to 18 GHz.
   Insertion loss is less than 2 dB up to 9 GHz. Area of the filter having
   fractional bandwidth 60\% at 3.85 GHz is 0.67 ?g x 0.11 ?g. Passband
   loss is within 1.5 and 20 dB stopband is at least up to 12 GHz. The
   proposed filter structure is very simple to integrate, and the

Abstract = {{In this work, we present for the first time a simple synthetic route to
   fabricate a controlled lead sulfide (PbS) structure using amino acid
   mixed precursor. High yield star-shaped PbS crystals were developed by
   solvothermal synthesis technique using an environment friendly
   aminocaproic acid (ACA) mixed methanolic Pb-TU complex precursor at 170
   degrees C for 20 h. The mechanism leading to these star-shaped PbS
   crystals was discussed. The as-synthesized PbS crystals were
   characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and Fourier
   transform infrared (FTIR). The obtained results show that the
   synthesized star-shaped PbS crystals were exempt of impurities and were
   crystalline with cubic phase. Finally, the FTIR study indicates that
   molecules were bounded on the surface of PbS crystal via nitrogen lone
   pair of the amino head groups. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Four single-site metallocene catalyst based polyethylenes (mPEs), one
   ultra low density polyethylene, one conventional linear low density
   polyethylene (LLDPE), and one low density polyethylene (LDPE) were
   selected to characterize the effect of side chain branches on physical
   and mechanical properties. Rheological experiments were carried out to
   extract complex viscosity and elasticity as a function of frequency.
   Elongational viscosity tests were also performed to assess long chain
   branching. For some mPEs, sparse long chain branching improved shear
   thinning and elasticity of the chains in melt state. During elongation,
   mPEs with a narrow linear chain distribution showed initially greater
   melt strength whereas for longer elongation, the mPEs with long chain
   branching lead over in strength. Cast films were produced from the mPEs
   and their physical (such as crystallinity, crystal size) and mechanical
   properties were tested. A double melting peak was observed in the
   differential scanning calorimetry thermograms of the mPE films. A
   relatively sharp strain hardening behavior in tensile tests was observed
   for the mPEs films when compared to LLDPE. Fourier transform infrared
   was used as an effective and fast method to investigate side chain
   length. It was found that the positioning of side chain, co-monomer
   length, and content influence the melting behavior of mPE films. POLYM.

Abstract = {{The study considers the effects of different dispersion levels of
   nanoclay on the crosslinking reaction of thermoplastic vulcanizate (TPV)
   nanocomposites based on polypropylene/ethylene propylene diene M-class
   rubber (PP/EPDM). PP nanocomposites with dispersion level ranging from
   intercalated structures to a mixture of intercalated tactoids and
   exfoliated layers were used as the thermoplastic phase. Dimethylol
   phenolic resin or octylphenol-formaldehyde resin was used as curing
   agents, along with stannous chloride dihydrate as the catalyst, to
   vulcanize the rubber phase during the reactive extrusion process.
   Initially, temperature effects were investigated in internal batch
   mixer. Subsequently, the effects of screw speed (i.e., shear rate and
   residence time) were evaluated along the screw length. Different
   criteria such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signal line width,
   bound curative content, and residual diene concentration were used to
   evaluate the extent of crosslinking, along with normalized storage
   modulus and gel content. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs showed that the
   dynamic vulcanization process improves the dispersion level of nanoclay
   in the final TPVs. It was found that the presence of nanoclay influences
   the crosslinking reaction, mainly through its effect on the continuity
   index of the EPDM phase. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 2012. (C) 2011 Society of

Abstract = {{This work focuses on the effect of gamma-ray radiation conditions on the
   stimuli-responsiveness and drug-eluting performance of polypropylene
   (PP) substrates grafted with interpenetrating networks of
   N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm) and acrylic acid (AAc). PNIPAAm was
   cross-linked applying 10-100 kGy doses in the presence and absence of
   the chemical cross-linker N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide (MBAAm). Then, the
   net-PP-g-PNIPAAm was interpenetrated with PAAc synthesized under a 2.5
   kGy dose to obtain net-PP-g-PNIPAAm-inter-net-PAAc films. The amount of
   grafted PNIPAAm (80\%, 125\% and 145\% levels) and the cross-linking
   radiation dose (10, 40 and 70 kGy levels) strongly determine the
   interpenetration of PAAc, the swelling degree, the amount of vancomycin
   loaded and its release rate. The chemical cross-linker only caused a
   minor decrease in the degree of swelling. The higher the PNIPAAm grafted
   on PP and the lower the cross-linking radiation dose, the more the PAAc
   in the IPN and, consequently, the higher the vancomycin loaded through
   specific interactions and the more sustained the release (> 8 h). The
   films possessing these features exhibited vancomycin release rate per
   surface unit suitable to prevent bacterial growth. Thus, adequate tuning
   of the radiation doses during grafting and cross-linking of the PNIPAAm
   networks may enable to achieve surface-modified materials for medical
   devices with an antibiofilm performance. Crown Copyright (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The lattice Boltzmann method is applied to the study of immiscible
   two-phase flows using a Rothman-Keller-type (RK) model. The focus is on
   the algorithm proposed by Latva-Kokko and Rothman, which has been
   modified and integrated into the Reis and Phillips model, which belongs
   to the RK family. A key element of the RK model is the recoloring step
   applied at the interface of two fluids, at which the fluids are
   separated and sent to their own region. When convection is weak, the
   interface in the Reis and Phillips model suffers from ``lattice
   pinning{''}, which is a problem that may prevent the interface from
   moving. While the recoloring algorithm proposed by Latva-Kokko and
   Rothman diminishes this problem, it was not used in the work of Reis and
   Phillips. This is the framework in which the present study has been
   conducted. Its scope is twofold: first, to integrate and adapt the
   Latva-Kokko and Rothman recoloring algorithms for reducing the lattice
   pinning problem found in the Reis and Phillips model; and second, to
   conduct a set of numerical tests to show that the combination of the two
   algorithms leads to an improvement in the quality of the results, along
   with a better convergence. The context of the work is two-dimensional,
   with the D2Q9 lattice used as the basic computational element. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{High metal contamination in toys and low-cost jewelry is a widespread
   problem, and metals can become bioavailable, especially via oral pathway
   due to common child-specific behaviors of mouthing and pica. In this
   review, the U.S., Canadian, and European Union (EU) legislations on
   metals in toys and jewelry are evaluated. A literature review on
   content, bioavailability, children's exposure, and testing of metals in
   toys and low-cost jewelry is provided. A list of priority metals is
   presented, and research needs and legislative recommendations are
   addressed. While the U.S. and Canadian legislations put emphasis on lead
   exposure prevention, other toxic elements like arsenic and cadmium in
   toy materials are not regulated except in paint and coatings. The EU
   legislation is more comprehensive in terms of contaminants and
   scientific approach. Current toy testing procedures do not fully
   consider metal bioavailability. in vitro bioaccessibility tests
   developed and validated for toys and corresponding metal
   bioaccessibility data in different toy matrices are lacking. The U.S.
   and Canadian legislations should put more emphasis on metal
   bioavailability and on other metals in addition to lead. A two-step
   management approach with mandatory testing of toys for total metal
   concentrations followed by voluntary bioaccessibility testing could be
   implemented.}},

   ablation and fragmentation in various liquids (n-hexane, diethyl ether,
   toluene, 2-propanol, acetone, and methanol) to investigate their
   influences on the size of the generated particles. Results suggest that
   nanoparticle growth with the absence of surfactants occurs from light
   absorption by the colloids through diffusion coalescence and can be
   controlled by the solvent polarity, the processing time, and the laser
   power. Furthermore, the growth has been related to the electrostatic
   repulsion energy and to the change in the nanoparticle temperature due
   to the laser light absorption by using the DLVO theory. Nanosecond laser
   annealing of Au particles in methanol also confirms the proposed model.}},

Abstract = {{Optical resonant microcavities with ultra high quality factors are
   widely used for biosensing. Until now, the primary method of detection
   has been based upon tracking the resonant wavelength shift as a function
   of biodetection events. One of the sources of noise in all
   resonant-wavelength shift measurements is the noise due to intensity
   fluctuations of the laser source. An alternative approach is to track
   the change in the quality factor of the optical cavity by using phase
   shift cavity ring down spectroscopy, a technique which is insensitive to
   the intensity fluctuations of the laser source. Here, using biotinylated
   microtoroid resonant cavities, we show simultaneous measurement of the
   quality factor and the wavelength shift by using phase shift cavity ring
   down spectroscopy. These measurements were performed for disassociation
   phase of biotin-streptavidin reaction. We found that the disassociation
   curves are in good agreement with the previously published results.
   Hence, we demonstrate not only the application of phase shift cavity
   ring down spectroscopy to microcavities in the liquid phase but also
   simultaneous measurement of the quality factor and the wavelength shift
   for the microcavity biosensors in the application of kinetics
   measurements. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Pages = {{69-76}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The objective of this study was to use finite element model
   (FEM) simulations and experimental testing to study the relationship
   between lower limb positioning for surgeries of the spine and changes in
   sagittal curves.
   Methods: Four volunteers underwent lower limb flexibility and range of
   motion testing before being placed prone on a new surgical frame where
   lateral radiographs of their spines were taken in positions of hip
   flexion (average 48 degrees) and extension (average 13 degrees).
   Personalized FEMs were created representing each volunteer's spine, rib
   cage, pelvis, and lower limbs. Optimization of model behavior was
   performed by adjustment of lower limb muscle initial strains. The FEMs
   were exploited to examine the impact of more extreme and intermediate
   lower limb positions; 30 degrees of hip extension to 90 degrees of
   flexion at intervals of 20 degrees.
   Results: With increased hip flexion, lordosis and kyphosis decreased to
   an average of 52\% (35 degrees) and 16\% (6 degrees), respectively.
   Personalization of the 4 FEMs allowed reproduction of the experimental
   results within 5 degrees and their subsequent exploitation showed the
   linear changes in lordosis and kyphosis between extreme positions
   decreasing an average of 84\% (59 degrees) and 34\% (13 degrees) with
   increased hip flexion. A strong correlation was found between
   experimental change in lordosis and individual hamstring flexibilities
   (R = -0.93) which allowed for the development of a predictive equation
   for lordosis in terms of hip flexion which factors straight leg raise
   test results.
   Conclusions: Knowledge gained through this study can be used to improve
   intraoperative control of sagittal curves through lower limb
   positioning.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a methodology for enhancing the strategic investment

   alternatives where (1) traditional techno-economic analysis and
   multivariate stochastic risk analysis are used in the first
   pre-screening step, and (2) an advanced analysis framework based on
   steady-state process modeling, product costing using principles of
   activity-based costing (ABC), and panel-based multicriteria
   decision-making (MCDM) is used in the second screening step. In the
   MCDM, financial-and risk-based decision-making criteria are used. A case
   study considering the retrofit implementation of a biorefinery into a
   kraft pulp and paper mill demonstrates the methodology.}},

   were modified to minimize loss of mass and distortion of in situ
   perspectives. Environmental scanning electron microscopy revealed that
   nitrifying biofilm did not exhibit significant changes in volume with
   exposure to 4 degrees C. Confocal laser scanning microscopy in
   combination with FISH showed that the number of ammonia-oxidizing
   bacteria (AOB) cells present in the biofilm was statistically consistent
   during exposure to 4 degrees C. The RNA content of AOB cells remained
   sufficient for FISH enumeration. The number of nitrite-oxidizing
   bacteria cells remained steady during exposure to 4 degrees C; however,
   the RNA content of the cells appeared to decrease with exposure to 4
   degrees C, thereby preventing their enumeration using FISH. Water

   issue and, among all the sectors, wireless access networks are largely
   responsible for the increase in consumption. In addition to the access
   segment, wireless technologies are also gaining popularity for the
   backhaul infrastructure of cellular systems mainly due to their cost and
   easy deployment. In this context, Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN) are
   commonly considered the most suitable architecture because of their
   versatility that allows flexible configurations. In this paper we
   combine the flexibility of WMN with the need for energy consumption
   reduction by presenting an optimization framework for network management
   that takes into account the trade off between the network energy needs
   and the daily variations of the demand. A resolution approach and a
   thorough discussion on the details related to WMN energy management are
   also presented.}},

Abstract = {{The rheological characterisation of semisolid AZ91D magnesium alloy has
   been successfully studied using a Couette rheometer. Different applied
   regimes by varying the temperature and the shearing in semisolid state
   revealed the rheological behaviour of the alloy and were confirmed by
   microstructural evolution. The apparent viscosity was the critical
   parameter that was studied during the applied regimes. The change in the
   morphology of the solid phase during the thermomechanical treatment was
   the main cause of the evolution of the apparent viscosity. The evolution
   of the morphology of the solid phase, from dendritic to globular, due to
   the shearing, had a significant impact on the rheological behaviour of
   the slurry which was correlated to the operating conditions by an
   analytical model.}},

Abstract = {{The impacts of ozone (0-8 mg O-3 L-1) and filtration with biological
   activated carbon on membrane fouling by surface waters were investigated
   using three low-pressure membranes (two ceramics-UF or MF-and one
   polymeric-UF). The unified membrane fouling index (UMFI) was used to
   quantify the reversibility and irreversibility of membrane fouling.
   Minimum UMFI were calculated and repeatability assays were performed in
   order to evaluate the analytical detection limit and the precision of
   the method, respectively. The lowest ozone dose tested (1 mg O-3 L-1)
   reduced the total fouling by 44, 63, and 41\% for the polymeric
   membrane, the UF ceramic membrane, and the MF ceramic membrane,
   respectively. Further increase of the dose led to minor or no
   improvement, except for the ceramic MF membrane. For the ceramic
   membranes, a similar trend to that observed for total fouling was
   observed for hydraulically irreversible fouling. For the polymeric
   membrane, the hydraulically and chemically irreversible fouling were too
   low to be measured. Although biofiltration reduced the average dissolved
   organic carbon and turbidity by 25 and 50\%, respectively, no
   significant fouling reduction was observed. The results indicate that
   irreversible fouling measurements are highly variable and most of the
   time below the analytical detection limit.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an analytical and numerical study of natural
   convection of nanofluids contained in a rectangular enclosure subject to
   uniform heat flux along the vertical sides. Governing parameters of the
   problem under study are the thermal Rayleigh number Ra, the Prandtl
   number Pr, the aspect ratio of the cavity A and the solid volume
   fraction of nanoparticles, Phi. Three types of nanoparticles are taken
   into consideration: Cu, Al2O3 and TiO2. Various models are used for
   calculating the effective viscosity and thermal conductivity of
   nanofluids. In the first part of the analytical study, a scale analysis
   is made for the boundary layer regime situation. In the second part, an
   analytical solution based on the parallel flow approximation is reported
   for tall enclosures (A >> 1). In the boundary layer regime a good
   agreement is obtained between the predictions of the scale analysis and
   those of the analytical solution. Solutions for the flow fields,
   temperature distributions and Nusselt numbers are obtained explicitly in
   terms of the governing parameters of the problem. A numerical study of
   the same phenomenon, obtained by solving the complete system of the
   governing equations, is also conducted. A good agreement is found

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{239-251}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In some companies such as large retail stores, the employees perform
   different activities (e.g., cashier or clerk in a specific department)
   to respond to a customer demand for each activity that varies over the
   planning horizon and must be fulfilled as soon as possible. For a given
   time period, this demand translates into an ideal number of employees
   required for the corresponding activity. During a work shift, an
   employee can be assigned to several activities that are interruptible at
   any time and subject to operational constraints (required skills,
   minimum and maximum assignment durations). Given work shifts already
   assigned to the employees, the multi-activity assignment problem (MAAP)
   consists of assigning activities to the shifts such that the activity
   demands are satisfied as best as possible over the planning horizon. In
   this paper, we propose three integer programming models for the MAAP and
   develop various heuristics based on mathematical programming techniques.
   Computational results obtained on randomly generated MAAP instances show
   that a heuristic column generation method embedded into a rolling
   horizon procedure provides the best results in general.}},

Abstract = {{Utilisation of steel fibre reinforced concrete (SFRC) for designing
   structural members requires knowledge of the post-cracking tensile
   response. This paper reviews the experimental characterisation tests and
   subsequent analysis commonly used for determining the post-cracking
   tensile properties of SFRC. The experimental program supporting this
   investigation comprised five different SFRC mixes with fibre volumes
   ranging from 0.75 to 1.25\% used to fabricate a set of characterisation
   specimens for uniaxial tension tests, notched beam tests and round panel
   tests carried out in parallel with an extensive experimental program on
   large scale beams. Characterisation test results allowed a comparison
   between direct stress-crack opening measurements and the stress-crack
   openings retrieved from the inverse analysis of bending tests.
   Discrepancies in post-cracking tensile results obtained with the three
   types of tests are analyzed and related mainly to test configurations,
   the presence of a predefined crack, support conditions, fibre
   orientation, and cracked surface size. Results obtained using material
   characterisations are then applied to the reproduction of the structural
   behaviour of large scale beams, documented in a companion paper.}},

Abstract = {{Practical steel fibre reinforced concrete (SFRC) applications in
   load-carrying structural members have yet to gain wide acceptance in
   design codes. This is partly explained by the lack of a unified design
   philosophy adapted to this material. A model based on simple and widely
   accepted assumptions is proposed for the analysis and the design of SFRC
   members subjected to bending moments. In order to evaluate the accuracy
   of the analytical model predictions, an extensive experimental program
   was conducted on 21 rectangular and T-beams of various sizes produced
   with five different types of SFRC. The contribution of fibres at
   different loading phases in bending is described in detail. The
   analytical model accuracy to predict maximum crack opening applicable in
   service conditions and at the ultimate flexural strength are compared to
   experimental measurements. Discrepancies observed are related to the
   dispersion of the material properties and the difference of fibre
   orientation in beams and characterization specimens. Finally, the
   proposed design approach is applied to the design of a realistic T-beam
   subjected to positive and negative bending moments.}},

Abstract = {{Our recently developed model for the viscosity of silicate melts is
   extended to describe and predict the viscosities of oxide melts
   containing boron. The model requires three adjustable parameters to
   reproduce the viscosity of B2O3-SiO2 melts and two parameters for each
   B2O3-MOx melt, where MOx is a basic oxide other than an alkali oxide.
   All available experimental data have been collected for binary melts
   formed by B2O3 with SiO2, Al2O3, CaO, MgO, ZnO, PbO to calibrate the
   model. The viscosities of the B2O3-containing ternary and higher-order
   subsystems of the B2O3-CaO-MgO-PbO-ZnO-SiO2 system and of the
   B2O3-CaO-MgO-PbO-ZnO-Al2O3 system are then predicted by the model
   without any additional adjustable parameters. Experimental data were
   found for only five such subsystems: B2O3-PbO-SiO2, B2O3-CaO-SiO2,
   B2O3-PbO-ZnO, B2O3-PbO-Al2O3 and B2O3-CaO- Al2O3. Predictions of the
   model are compared to these experimental data.}},

Title = {{Indirect human exposure assessment of airborne lead deposited on soil
   via a simplified fate and speciation modelling approach}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{421}},
Pages = {{203-209}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{In order to estimate the total exposure to the lead emissions from a
   municipal waste combustion plant in Denmark, the indirect pathway via
   ingestion of lead deposited on soil has to be quantified. Multi-media
   fate models developed for both Risk Assessment (RA) and Life Cycle
   Assessment (LCA) can be used for this purpose, but present high
   uncertainties in the assessment of metal's fate. More sophisticated and
   metal-specific geochemical models exist, that could lower the
   uncertainties by e.g. accounting for metal speciation, but they require
   a large amount of data and are unpractical to combine broadly with other
   fate and dispersion models. In this study, a Simplified Fate \&
   Speciation Model (SFSM) is presented, that is based on the parsimony
   principle: ``as simple as possible, as complex as needed{''}, and that
   can be used for indirect human exposure assessment in different context
   like RA and regionalized LCA. SFSM couples traditional multi-media mass
   balances with empirical speciation models in a tool that has a simple
   theoretical framework and that is not data-intensive. The model
   calculates total concentration, dissolved concentration, and free ion
   activity of Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn in different soil layers, after
   accounting for metal deposition and dispersion. The model is tested for
   these five metals by using data from peer reviewed literature. Results
   show good accordance between measured and calculated values (factor of
   3). The model is used to predict the human exposure via soil to lead
   initially emitted into air by the waste combustion plant and both the
   lead cumulative exposure and intake fraction are calculated. (C) 2012

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{901-914}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates the potential of graphene nonreciprocal
   gyrotropy for microwave applications. First, the problem of a plane wave
   obliquely impinging on a graphene sheet is analyzed to provide physical
   insight into the fundamentals of graphene gyrotropy. It is found that
   graphene rotates the polarization of any plane wave impinging on it. The
   rotation angle is larger for H-polarized oblique waves than for normally
   incident waves and increases as the angle of incidence increases. The
   opposite holds for waves. A general transmission matrix model is then
   developed for an arbitrary cylindrical waveguide and for a graphene
   sheet inside such a waveguide. This model is next applied to a circular
   cylindrical waveguide loaded with one or several graphene sheets and
   excited in its dominant mode. Although the rotation angle from a single
   graphene sheet is quite high at high chemical potential, the
   corresponding transmission level is small due to the poor matching
   associated with the high density of the sheet. This fact prohibits the
   cascading of graphene sheets with high chemical potential as an approach
   to increase the amount of rotation. However, by decreasing the chemical
   potential, graphene may be well matched to waveguide modes, and
   therefore a large number of graphene sheets (ten in this study) may be
   used to produce a significant amount of rotation with relatively low
   insertion loss.}},

Volume = {{60}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a low-cost integrated 60-GHz switched-beam smart antenna
   subsystem is studied and demonstrated experimentally for the first time
   based on almost all 60-GHz substrate integrated waveguide (SIW)
   components including a slot antenna, 4 x 4 Butler matrix network,
   bandpass filter, sub-harmonically pumped mixer, and local oscillator
   (LO) source. In this study, an antenna array, a Butler matrix, and a
   bandpass filter are integrated and fabricated into one single substrate.
   Instead of using a 60-GHz LO source, a 30-GHz LO source is developed to
   drive a low-cost 60-GHz sub-harmonically pumped mixer. This 30-GHz LO
   circuit consists of 10-GHz SIW voltage-controlled oscillator and
   frequency tripler. Following the frequency down-conversion of four
   60-GHz signals coming from the 4 x 4 Butler matrix and a comparison of
   the four IF signals executed in the digital processor based on the
   maximum received power criterion, control signals will be feed-backed to
   drive the single-pole four-throw switch array and then the beam is tuned
   in order to point toward the main beam of the transmit antenna. In this
   way, the arriving 60-GHz RF signal can be tracked effectively. All
   designed components are verified experimentally. The proposed smart
   receiver subsystem that integrates all those front-end components is
   concluded with satisfactory measured results.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of point-of-use (POU) devices to remove dissolved and
   particulate lead (Pb) and their effect on tap water quality were
   investigated in a large building (i.e., a penitentiary complex) under
   typical use patterns during a one-year period. Both forms of Pb were
   efficiently removed, although materials downstream of the POU devices
   slightly increased total Pb levels at the tap. No evidence of POU
   breakthrough was observed after stagnations carried out before sampling.
   Although measurements of heterotrophic plate counts (HPCs) and total and
   live bacteria on the POU material itself indicated no significant
   colonization, small but significant increases in viable bacteria at the
   tap suggest that colonization occurred in the piping and tap downstream
   of the POU unit in the absence of chlorine residual. This study suggests
   that POU devices constitute a useful remediation approach to control Pb
   in large buildings, providing that building maintenance procedures are

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A novel stochastic joint inversion method based on cokriging is applied
   to estimate density and magnetic susceptibility distributions from
   gravity and total magnetic field data. The method fully integrates the
   physical relations between density-gravity, on one hand, and magnetic
   susceptibility-total magnetic field, on the other hand. As a
   consequence, when the data are considered noise-free, the responses from
   the inverted density and susceptibility data exactly reproduce the
   observed data. The required density and magnetic susceptibility auto-
   and cross covariance are assumed to follow a linear model of
   coregionalization (LCM). The parameters of the LCM are estimated from
   v-v plot fitting of the gravity and total magnetic experimental
   covariances. The model is tested on two synthetic cases and one real
   data set, the Perseverance mine (Quebec, Canada). Joint inversions are
   compared to separate inversions. The joint inversions better recover the
   known models in the synthetic cases. With the real data set, better
   definition and location of the mineralized lenses are achieved by joint
   inversion. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present a theoretical scheme for laser cooling with colloidal
   lead-salt PbSe quantum dots (QDs) doped in a glass host. The laser
   cooling process is based on the anti-Stokes fluorescence in QDs. The
   relatively short (microsecond range) lifetime of the excited level of
   the PbSe QD allows the cooling process to be accelerated and new
   materials with higher phonon energy to be used as hosts, which are
   normally considered unsuitable for cooling with rare-earth ions. The
   considerable increase (by similar to 10(4)) in the absorption cross
   section of the PbSe QD in comparison with the absorption cross section

Abstract = {{When subjected to cyclic loadings, such as those induced by earthquakes,
   hard rock mine tailings may undergo liquefaction. Such a response can be
   damaging to the tailings impoundment and, in the case of a breach, to
   the surroundings. Means must thus be considered to control or alleviate
   the risks due to liquefaction. This paper presents the main results of a
   laboratory investigation that focussed on the dynamic behaviour of
   tailings due to cyclic loading on a seismic table. Different conditions
   were investigated to assess the influence of various factors, including
   tailings density and the presence of rigid and (or) drainage inclusions.
   The main results obtained during the tests conducted on the tailings,
   with and without inclusions, are presented and discussed with an
   emphasis on the development of excess porewater pressures. The main
   limitations of this experimental work are also discussed. These results
   show that inclusions can have a significant effect on the dynamic
   response of the tailings and on the occurrence of liquefaction.}},

Abstract = {{3-D assessment of scoliotic deformities relies on an accurate 3-D
   reconstruction of bone structures from biplanar X-rays, which requires a
   precise detection and matching of anatomical structures in both views.
   In this paper, we propose a novel semiautomated technique for detecting
   complete scoliotic rib borders from PA-0 degrees and PA-20 degrees chest
   radiographs, by using an edge-following approach with multiple-path
   branching and oriented filtering. Edge-following processes are initiated
   from user starting points along upper and lower rib edges and the final
   rib border is obtained by finding the most parallel pair among detected
   edges. The method is based on a perceptual analysis leading to the
   assumption that no matter how bent a scoliotic rib is, it will always
   present relatively parallel upper and lower edges. The proposed method
   was tested on 44 chest radiographs of scoliotic patients and was
   validated by comparing pixels from all detected rib borders against
   their reference locations taken from the associated manually delineated
   rib borders. The overall 2-D detection accuracy was 2.64 +/- 1.21
   pixels. Comparing this accuracy level to reported results in the
   literature shows that the proposed method is very well suited for
   precisely detecting borders of scoliotic ribs from PA-0 degrees and
   PA-20 degrees chest radiographs.}},

Abstract = {{Design space exploration is a delicate process whose success lays on the
   designers' shoulders. It is often based on a trial-and-error approach.
   Some basic metrics can be used to guide this process. In this paper, we
   explore accelerating loops from C-based specifications. We built a
   framework in which a design style, such as software-oriented or
   application-specific instruction-set processor (ASIP)-oriented design,
   can be specified. We also propose an exploration process that allows
   targeting the main aspects that limit acceleration and the actions that
   can be made to improve it. The process is based on new loop-oriented
   metrics that provide insight in key design issues. They help to
   determine which aspects of the design between data accesses and
   arithmetic logic unit (ALU)/control operations limit or allow leveraging
   loop acceleration opportunities. We profile some benchmarks from the
   signal and image processing fields, such as the Turbo Decoder and the
   JPEG algorithms, to illustrate how loop-oriented metrics help to point
   out aspects that limit or improve loop acceleration. The loop
   acceleration process was also used to explore design architectures that
   can leverage, as much as possible, the loop acceleration opportunities
   of the sum of absolute differences (SAD) algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Surface plasmon resonancebased biosensors are now acknowledged as robust
   and reliable instruments to determine the kinetic parameters related to
   the interactions between biomolecules. These kinetic parameters are used
   in screening campaigns: there is a considerable interest in reducing the
   experimental time, thus improving the throughput of the surface plasmon
   resonance assays. Kinetic parameters are typically obtained by analyzing
   data from several injections of a given analyte at different
   concentrations over a surface where its binding partner has been
   immobilized. It has been already proven that an iterative optimization
   approach aiming at determining optimal analyte injections to be
   performed online can significantly reduce the experimentation time
   devoted to kinetic parameter determination, without any detrimental
   effect on their standard errors. In this study, we explore the potential
   of this iterative optimization approach to further reduce experiment
   duration by combining it with the simultaneous injection of two

Abstract = {{The control of thermal degradation of polylactide (PLA) during
   processing is still a challenge for the industry. In addition, the
   presence of an organically modified clay intensifies the rate of PLA
   degradation and molecular weight (M-W) reduction. In this work, three
   different chain extenders: polycarbodiimide (PCDI), tris (nonyl phenyl)
   phosphite (TNPP) and Joncryl (R) ADR 4368, were incorporated into PLA
   and PLA-based nanocomposites containing 2 wt\% clay (Cloisite (R) 30B)
   in an effort to control thermal degradation. The thermal and rheological
   properties of the PLA and PLA nanocomposites with and without chain
   extender were investigated. Thermogravimetric analysis showed an
   increase in the onset temperature for thermal degradation after the
   incorporation of PCDI (2 wt\%), TNPP (1 wt\%), or Joncryl (1 wt\%) into
   the nanocomposite. The theological results revealed that the addition of
   such a concentration of chain extender had a profound effect on the
   degradation and even increased the molecular weight in some cases. The
   mechanism of stabilization is most likely chain extension that results
   in the formation of longer linear chains in the PCDI and TNPP-modified
   nanocomposites, and a long chain branched (LCB) structure in
   Joncryl-based nanocomposites. It was found that Joncryl was the most
   efficient chain extender among the ones used in this study. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study on Type I and Type II errors that are

   the Proportional Hazard Model. The objective is to study the accuracy
   and the robustness of these techniques to variations in the models'
   parameters. Monte Carlo simulation is used to simulate the performance
   of these techniques. The effects of parameter's variations are obtained
   through Taguchi's design of experiments, and the results are analyzed by
   the analysis of variance technique. Those results show that accuracy and
   robustness should be taken into consideration when maintenance decisions
   are taken. Optimization techniques can be used to optimize the values of
   the parameters in order to minimize the two types of errors and to
   increase the correct decisions.}},

   In this paper, we describe how these rogues develop, outline the natural
   selection process that leads to their hampering the asset management
   program, and examine some of the negative impacts that ensue. Then we
   propose a Condition based maintenance approach to control the
   development of these components. We explore the use of a supervised
   learning data mining technique called Logical analysis of data (LAD) in
   CBM for the purpose of detecting rogues within a population of
   repairable components. We apply the resulting LAD based decision model
   on an inventory of turbo compressors belonging to an airline fleet.
   Finally, we evaluate the applicability of LAD to the rogue component
   detection problem and review its efficiency as a decision model for this
   type of problem.}},

Abstract = {{In the past three decades, studies of simultaneous maintenance and
   production planning have been focusing on age-dependent machine failure
   and inventory. This paper presents the interaction between defective
   products and optimal control of production rate, lead time and
   inventory. Our aim is to minimize the expected discounted overall cost
   due to maintenance activities, inventory holding and backlogs. Through
   Condition-Based Maintenance, we monitor in a real time the manufacturing
   system's health by describing N operational states. We consider two
   maintenance states of a machine controlled by two decision variables:
   production and maintenance rates. The optimal policy is characterized by
   the dynamic programming solution to a piecewise deterministic optimal
   control problem. A numerical illustration and a sensitive analysis are
   developed with a set of parameters calibrated on an existing
   manufacturing system.}},

Abstract = {{Pulsed eddy current (PEC) is a non-destructive testing method used to
   detect corrosion and cracks in multilayer aluminum structures which are
   typically found in aircraft applications. Corrosion and metal loss in
   thin multi-layer structures are complex and variable phenomena that
   diminish the reliability of pulsed eddy current measurements. In this
   article, pulsed eddy current signals are processed to improve the
   accuracy and reliably of these measurements. PEC's results (time domain
   data) are converted by time-frequency analysis (Rihaczek distribution)
   to represent data in three dimensions. The time-frequency approach
   generates a large amount of data. Principal component analysis is
   applied as feature extraction to reduce redundant data to provide new
   features for classifiers. K-means clustering and
   expectation-maximization are applied to classify data and automatically
   determine corrosion distribution in each layer. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This work presents a three-dimensional mathematical model to simulate
   temperature profiles inside a material heated by electromagnetic waves
   (EMW) at 2.45GHz. COMSOL-Multiphysics was used to simulate transient
   temperature profiles of pinewood, carbon, Pyrex, and combinations of
   such under different conditions. The model predicts that, upon exposing
   an 86mm wooden cube to 2.45GHz EMW for 300 s, the core temperature
   reached 595 K at a setting of 60 K/min, while the outer surface 365 K at
   15 K/min. By mixing 50\% carbon with the wooden block, the model
   anticipated the cube core to reach 990 K at 140 K/min, compared to 1350
   K at 212 K/min with 75\% carbon at the same power and after the same
   time. By inserting a 125cm(3) carbon cube inside the wood cube, the core
   reaches 3200 K, while the outer surface was 375 K and 636 K for free
   convection (FC) and perfect insulator (PI), respectively. Placing the
   same volume of carbon on the surface of the wood cube yielded a maximum
   temperature of 660 K under FC, compared to 1280 K with PI. Changing the
   material of the core cube from Carbon to Pyrex yields a temperature of
   324 K in the core, with 365 K and 605 K on the outer surface in the case
   of FC or PI, respectively. The average percentage relative error between
   the measured and the predicted temperatures was +/- 4\% and +/- 15\%
   inside the pinewood and carbon respectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The detection of cyanobacteria and their associated toxins has
   intensified in recent years in both drinking water sources and the raw
   water of drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs). The objectives of this
   study were to: 1) estimate the breakthrough and accumulation of toxic
   cyanobacteria in water, scums and sludge inside a DWTP, and 2) to
   determine whether chlorination can be an efficient barrier to the
   prevention of cyanotoxin breakthrough in drinking water. In a full scale
   DWTP, the fate of cyanobacteria and their associated toxins was studied
   after the addition of coagulant and powdered activated carbon, post
   clarification, within the clarifier sludge bed, after filtration and
   final chlorination. Elevated cyanobacterial cell numbers (4.7 x 10(6)
   cells/mL) and total microcystins concentrations (up to 10 mg/L)
   accumulated in the clarifiers of the treatment plant. Breakthrough of
   cells and toxins in filtered water was observed. Also, a total
   microcystins concentration of 2.47 mu g/L was measured in chlorinated
   drinking water. Cyanobacterial cells and toxins from environmental bloom
   samples were more resistant to chlorination than results obtained using
   laboratory cultured cells and dissolved standard toxins. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Drinking water sources in many regions are subject to proliferation of
   toxic cyanobacteria (CB). Chlorination of source water containing toxic
   cyanobacterial cells for diverse treatment purposes might cause cell
   damage, toxin release and disinfection by-products (DBP) formation.
   There is limited information available on chlorination of different
   toxic CB cells and DBP formation potentials. This work: (1) determines
   the extent of lysis and toxins/taste and odor compound release in
   chlorinated natural water from CB cells (Anabaena circinalis,
   Microcystis aeruginosa, Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, and
   Aphanizomenon issatsckenka) from laboratory cultures and natural blooms;
   (2) assesses the rates of oxidation of toxins by free chlorine under
   environmental conditions; (3) studies the DBP formation associated with
   the chlorination of CB cell suspensions. With chlorine exposure (CT)
   value of <4.0 mg min/L >60\% cells lost viability causing toxin release.
   Cell membrane damage occurred faster than oxidation of released toxins.
   Kinetic analysis of the oxidation of toxins in natural water revealed
   significant differences in their susceptibility to chlorine, saxitoxins
   being the easiest to oxidize, followed by cylindrospermopsin and
   microcystin-LR. Furthermore, concentrations of trihalomethanes and
   haloacetic acids (<40 mu g/L) and N-nitrosodimethylamine (<10 ng/L) as
   chlorination by-products were lower than the guideline values even at
   the highest CT value (220 mg min/L). However, the DBP concentrations in
   environmental bloom conditions with very high cell numbers were over the
   guideline values. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A thin-film barium-strontium-titanate (BST) and a conventional silicon
   varactor tunable dual-band quadrature hybrid couplers are characterized
   and compared in this article. Both structures are composed of four
   quarter-wavelength sections at a frequency located between the two
   operating frequencies, and with two pairs of open-ended stubs.
   Frequencies tuning make used of BST interdigital and silicon varactor
   diode capacitors connected at the open-ended stubs. The characterized
   BST interdigital capacitor presents a capacitive-tunability of 52\%
   through an applied voltage of 0 to 25 V, while 82.5\% is for the
   selected commercial silicon varactor diode. The silicon varactor-tuned
   dual-band coupler exhibits 45.9 and 5.2\% center operation tuning
   frequency for the first and the second band, respectively, while 29.2
   and 4.3\% are achieved by the BST tunable coupler. With two-tone
   nonlinear characterization test, the BST tunable coupler biased at 0 and
   25 V presents a better IP3 of +25.45 and +35 dBm, respectively, while
   +11.5 and +34 dBm are obtained for the silicon varactor tunable coupler.

Abstract = {{A theoretical model for the density of multicomponent inorganic liquids
   based on the Modified Quasichemical Model has been presented previously.
   By introducing in the Gibbs free energy of the liquid phase
   temperature-dependent molar volume expressions for the pure components
   and pressure-dependent excess parameters for the binary (and sometimes
   higher-order) interactions, it is possible to reproduce, and eventually
   predict, the molar volume and the density of the multicomponent liquid
   phase using standard interpolation methods. In the present article, this
   density model is applied to the (NaCl + KCl + ZnCl2) ternary liquid and
   a Kohler-Toop-like asymmetric interpolation method is used. All
   available density data for the (NaCl + KCl + ZnCl2) liquid were
   collected and critically evaluated, and optimized pressure-dependent
   model parameters have been found. This new volumetric model can be used
   with Gibbs free energy minimization software, to calculate the molar
   volume and the density of (NaCl + KCl + ZnCl2) ternary melts. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Dual layers of Pt and Fe, deposited sequentially onto highly oriented
   pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), were annealed under ultrahigh vacuum, from
   room temperature to 560 degrees C. The formation of FePt alloy NPs,
   through interdiffusion, was studied by in situ X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS), ex situ atomic force (AFM), and high-resolution
   transmission electron (TEM) microscopies. With increasing annealing
   temperature, the Pt 4f(7/2) binding energy shifts positively, and the
   positions of the Pt 5d-6s valence band centers move away from the Fermi
   level and broaden. Between 300 and 400 degrees C, Fe and Pt atoms
   diffuse significantly. Simultaneously, a surface chemical reaction
   occurs between metal oxide and adventitious carbon on the NP surface,
   resulting in the disappearance of the O 1s spectrum and the formation of
   an amorphous hydrocarbon shell. At elevated temperatures, the shell is
   continually lost, through fragmentation, and replaced by a new
   hydrocarbon from the vacuum background, assuring that the NPs do not
   coalesce during the whole annealing process. Stable FePt alloy NPs are
   formed on the HOPG surface as the annealing temperature is increased to
   similar to 400 degrees C (A1 structure) and similar to 500 degrees C
   (L1(0) structure). A continual Pt surface enrichment occurs with
   increasing annealing temperature, even before the formation of stable
   L1(0) NPs, resulting in the formation of a Pt-rich layer around the NPs.
   On the basis of the mass balance in the system, an Fe-rich layer must
   lie below the Pt-rich layer, surrounding the L1(0) core.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the fabrication and transport properties of single-walled
   carbon nanotube (SWCNT)/polyurethane (PU) nanocomposite microfiber-based
   field effect transistors (FETs). UV-assisted direct-writing technology
   was used, and microfibers consisting of cylindrical micro-rods, having
   different diameters and various SWCNT loads, were fabricated directly
   onto SiO2/Si substrates in a FET scheme. The room temperature dc
   electrical conductivities of these microfibers were shown to increase
   with respect to the SWCNT concentrations in the nanocomposite, and were
   about ten orders of magnitude higher than that of the pure polyurethane,
   when the SWCNT load ranged from 0.1 to 2.5 wt\% only. Our results show
   that for SWCNT loads <= 1.5 wt\%, all the microfibers behave as a FET
   with p-type transport. The resulting FET exhibited excellent
   performance, with an I-on/I-off ratio of 10(5) and a maximum on-state
   current (Ion) exceeding 70 mu A. Correlations between the FET
   performance, SWCNTs concentration, and the microfiber diameters are also
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) combined with
   electroencephalography (fMRI-EEG) is a neuroimaging technique based on
   the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal which has been shown
   to be useful in the study of epilepsy for the localization of the
   epileptogenic focus. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
   combined with EEG (fNIRS-EEG) is another imaging technique based on the
   measurement of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin with complementary
   clinical potential in epilepsy, for continuous patient monitoring,
   language lateralization, and focus localization.
   In this work fMRI-EEG and fNIRS-EEG are used to quantify nonlinear
   hemodynamic responses in three cases of human refractory focal epilepsy,
   by using the Volterra kernel expansion up to second order. Prior to
   analyzing real data, extensive simulations are carried out to show that
   nonlinearities are estimable. The Volterra methodology is then applied
   to multimodal data recorded from 3 epileptic patients selected for their
   frequent spiking activity. Care is taken to account for variability of
   hemodynamic responses due to other causes than Volterra nonlinearities.
   Statistically significant nonlinearities are observed for all patients
   and all modalities. Good concordance between fNIRS and fMRI is found for
   both the amplitude of the Volterra responses, and, with limitations, in
   the localization of the epileptic focus and regions of inverted
   responses (negative BOLD signals). In one patient, Volterra
   nonlinearities allowed epileptic focus identification with fMRI, while
   analyses without nonlinearities failed to see it. In simulations when
   nonlinearities were included, analysis without Volterra nonlinearities
   performed poorly. These two observations suggest routinely checking for
   nonlinearities in functional imaging of patients presenting with
   frequent spikes., (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Polylactide-layered silicate nanocomposites with and without a chain
   extender were prepared by melt mixing using a twin-screw extruder. An
   organo-modified clay, Cloisite (R) 30B, and a chain extender Joncryl
   (R)-ADR 4368F were employed in this study. The effect of the chain
   extender and processing conditions on the properties of the PLA-clay
   nanocomposites were investigated for different strategies of mixing. The
   resulting nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD),
   while their morphology was observed by SEM and TEM. The incorporation of
   the chain extender could enhance the degree of clay dispersion provided
   that it is judiciously added to the nanocomposite. The corresponding
   results revealed that the Joncryl-based nanocomposites, where nanoclay
   platelets were well-dispersed, exhibited a significantly reduced
   permeability as compared to others. The mechanical properties of the
   neat PLA, the PLA and Joncryl-based nanocomposites were also examined.
   The increased molecular weight in Joncryl-based nanocomposites caused a
   significant increase in the modulus, drawability and toughness of the

Abstract = {{The MRI accelerator, a combination of a 6 MV linear accelerator with a
   1.5 T MRI, facilitates continuous patient anatomy updates regarding
   translations, rotations and deformations of targets and organs at risk.
   Accounting for these demands high speed, online intensity-modulated
   radiotherapy (IMRT) re-optimization. In this paper, a fast IMRT
   optimization system is described which combines aGPU-based Monte Carlo
   dose calculation engine for online beamlet generation and a fast inverse
   dose optimization algorithm. Tightly conformal IMRT plans are generated
   for four phantom cases and two clinical cases (cervix and kidney) in the
   presence of the magnetic fields of 0 and 1.5 T. We show that for the
   presented cases the beamlet generation and optimization routines are
   fast enough for online IMRT planning. Furthermore, there is no influence
   of the magnetic field on plan quality and complexity, and equal
   optimization constraints at 0 and 1.5 T lead to almost identical dose
   distributions.}},

Title = {{Direct-write fabrication of freestanding nanocomposite strain sensors}},
Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{MAR 2}},
Abstract = {{This paper deals with the design and microfabrication of two
   three-dimensional (3D) freestanding patterned strain sensors made of
   single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) nanocomposites with the
   ultraviolet-assisted direct-write (UV-DW) technique. The first sensor
   consisted of three nanocomposite microfibers suspended between two
   rectangular epoxy pads. The flexibility of the UV-DW technique enables
   the sensor and its housing to be manufactured in one monolithic
   structure. The second sensor was composed of a nanocomposite network
   consisting of four parallel microsprings, which demonstrates the high
   capability of the technique when compared to conventional
   photolithographic technologies. The performances of the sensors were
   assessed under tension and compression, respectively. The sensors'
   sensitivities were evaluated by correlating their measured resistivities
   to the applied displacements/strains. Electrical conductivity
   measurements revealed that the manufactured sensors are highly sensitive
   to small mechanical disturbances, especially for lower nanotube loadings
   when compared to traditional metallic or nanocomposite films. The
   present manufacturing method offers a new perspective for manufacturing
   highly sensitive 3D freestanding microstructured sensors.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of analytical and numerical analyses of
   the effects of performing a pressuremeter test or driving a pile in
   clay. The geometry of the problem has been simplified by the assumptions
   of plane strain and axial symmetry. Pressuremeter testing or
   installation of driven piles has been modelled as an undrained expansion
   of a cylindrical cavity. Stresses, pore water pressures, and
   deformations are found by assuming that the clay behaves like normally
   consolidated modified Cam clay. Closed-form solutions are obtained which
   allow the determination of the principal effective stresses and the
   strains around the cavity. The analysis which indicates that the
   intermediate principal stress at critical state is not equal to the mean
   of the other two principal stresses, except when the clay is initially
   isotropically consolidated, also permits finding the limit expansion and
   excess pore water pressures by means of the Almansi finite strain
   approach. Results are compared with published data which were determined
   using finite element and finite difference methods.}},

Volume = {{171}},
Pages = {{56-66}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we quantitatively analyze the extent of structure
   build-up at rest in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) dispersed in an epoxy by a
   set of transient flow measurements. Stress overshoots appeared at very
   small deformations during forward and reverse flow measurements by
   providing some rest time between the two consecutive flows in opposite
   directions, during which the suspensions structure was reconstructed.
   The rest time required to build-up the structure completely was much
   longer than the values reported in literature (about 1 h). Moreover,
   unlike fiber suspensions or some nano-composites, it was shown that the
   Brownian motion plays an important role in the structure build-up of the
   CNT suspensions in the absence of flow. We observed critical shear rates
   at low and intermediate concentrations above which some nanotube
   entanglements broke down; this resulted in lower elasticity of the
   suspensions and partial structure build-up at rest during transient flow
   reversal measurements. This phenomenon and the possible mechanisms of
   structure evolution during flow and rest were further investigated by
   comparing the experimental results with the predictions of a structural
   model. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   metallic surface to drive the array antenna elements. Dielectric cubes
   of low-permittivity material are placed on top of each 1 x 4 antenna
   array to increase the gain of the circular patch antenna elements. This
   new design is compared to a second 4 x 4 antenna array which, instead of
   dielectric cubes, uses vertically stacked Yagi-like parasitic director
   elements to increase the gain. Measured impedance bandwidths of the two
   4 x 4 antenna arrays are about 7.5 GHz (94.2-101.8 GHz) at 18 +/- 1 dB
   gain level, with radiation patterns and gains of the two arrays
   remaining nearly constant over this bandwidth. While the fabrication
   effort of the new array involving dielectric cubes is significantly
   reduced, its measured radiation efficiency of 81 percent is slightly
   lower compared to 90 percent of the Yagi-like design.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a technique
   that allows continuous non-invasive monitoring of tissue oxygenation and
   haemodynamics in the brain. By using combined EEG-fNIRS recordings, we
   sought to better understand the pathophysiology of temporal lobe
   seizures.
   Results: Nine patients (5 males; mean age 35 years; range 11-56 years)
   with refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy underwent combined
   EEG-fNIRS recordings. Eight complex partial seizures from 3 patients
   were successfully recorded. All seizures were associated with
   significant local and remote haemodynamic changes which outlasted the
   duration of seizures. Over the epileptogenic temporal lobe, increased
   oxygenation {[}increase in cerebral blood volume (CBV) and
   oxyhaemoglobin (HbO), decrease in deoxyhaemoglobin (HbR)] was followed
   by a deoxygenated state {[}increase in HbR]. A similar haemodynamic
   profile was seen over the contralateral temporal lobe (even without
   evidence of epileptic propagation) though variations generally had lower
   amplitudes. Heterogeneous haemodynamic changes in remote frontal and/or
   parietal areas were also noted early on when epileptic activity was
   limited to the temporal lobe.
   Conclusion: EEG-fNIRS reveals complex local and remote oxygenation
   changes during temporal lobe seizures. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   proposed system, wireless communication and sensing functions are fully
   integrated and sequentially arranged in the time domain so that they can
   operate independently (functional reconfiguration) and also jointly
   (functional fusion). For this proof-of-principle study, a system
   prototype is developed in the 24-GHz ISM band using the emerging
   substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) technology, which has been
   demonstrated as an attractive low-cost and high-efficiency development
   scheme for microwave and millimeter-wave systems. Experimental results
   show a very promising system performance. In addition to high-precision
   range detection with its radar mode, the present system has proved to
   have a great capability of wireless radio communication at a data rate
   of up to 50 Mbps for both binary-phase-shift-keying (BPSK) and
   quadrature-phase-shift-keying (QPSK) signals.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an innovative broadband millimeter-wave single
   balanced diode mixer that makes use of a substrate integrated waveguide
   (SIW)-based 180 degrees hybrid. It has low conversion loss of less than
   10 dB, excellent linearity, and high port-to-port isolations over a wide
   frequency range of 20 to 26 GHz. The proposed mixer has advantages over
   previously reported millimeter-wave mixer structures judging from a
   series of aspects such as cost, ease of fabrication, planar
   construction, and broadband performance. Furthermore, a receiver
   front-end that integrates a high-performance SIW slot-array antenna and
   our proposed mixer is introduced. Based on our proposed receiver
   front-end structure, a K-band wireless communication system with M-ary
   quadrature amplitude modulation is developed and demonstrated for
   line-of-sight channels. Excellent overall error vector magnitude
   performance has been obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Our recently developed model to describe the viscosity of silicate melts
   is extended to describe and predict the viscosities of alkali-rich
   silicate melts. The model requires one additional binary parameter for
   each M2O-SiO2 system, where M is an alkali metal, to a total of three
   binary parameters per binary system alkali oxide silica. In addition to
   unary and binary parameters, the model requires two ternary parameters
   for each alumina-containing ternary system MOx-Al2O3-SiO2, where MOx is
   a basic oxide, to describe the viscosity maxima in these ternary systems
   due to the Charge Compensation Effect. The viscosity of multicomponent
   melts and of ternary melts MOx-NOy-SiO2, where MOx and NOy are basic
   oxides, is predicted by the model solely from the unary, binary and
   ternary parameters. The available viscosity data for the
   alkali-containing subsystems of the Al2O3-CaO-MgO-Na2O-K2O-SiO2 system
   are reviewed. The model reproduces the experimental data for binary and
   ternary melts and predicts the viscosities of multicomponent melts
   within experimental error limits. In particular, the viscosities of
   glass melts and melts of importance for petrology are well predicted by
   the model.}},

Abstract = {{Results of an investigation aimed at determining bending moments and
   shear forces, required to design skewed concrete slab bridges using the
   equivalent-beam method are presented in this paper. Straight and skewed
   slab bridges were modeled using grillage and finite-element models to
   characterize their behavior under uniform and moving loads with the
   objective of determining the most appropriate modeling approach for
   design. A parametric study was carried out on 390 simply supported slabs
   with geometries covering one to four lane bridges of 3- to 20-m spans
   and with skew angles ranging from 0 to 60 degrees. The analyses showed
   that nonorthogonal grillages satisfactorily predict the amplitude and
   the transverse distribution of longitudinal bending moments and shear
   forces, and can be used for the analysis of skewed slab bridges. Results
   of the parametric study indicated that shear forces and secondary
   bending moments increase with increasing skew angle while longitudinal
   bending moments diminish. Equations are proposed to include, as part of
   the equivalent-beam method for skew angles up to 60 degrees, the
   increase of shear forces and the reduction of longitudinal bending
   moments. Equations are also given for computing secondary bending
   moments. A simplified approach aimed at determining the corner forces
   for straight and skewed bridges is proposed as an alternative to a
   more-refined analysis. The analyses indicated the presence of high
   vertical shear stresses in the vicinity of free edges that justifies
   suggesting to provide shear reinforcement along the slab free edges.

   is processed with a particle filter tracker, a clustering algorithm, and
   a Kalman filter to reduce tracking and measurement noise. The method was
   tested on videos from animal experiments and on a human patient.
   Tracking performance was then evaluated by comparison with manually
   selected regions of interest in thermographic images. The method
   achieves RMS temperature estimation errors of <0.1 degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{In spite of earlier experimental and modeling studies, the relative role
   of the intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) in spine mechanics has remained
   controversial. This study employs simple analytical and finite element
   (FE) models of the spine and its surrounding structures to investigate
   the contribution of IAP to spinal loading and stability. The analytical
   model includes the abdominal cavity surrounded by muscles, lumbar spine,
   rib cage and pelvic ring. The intra-abdominal cavity and its surrounding
   muscles are represented by a thin deformable cylindrical membrane.
   Muscle activation levels are simulated by changing the Young's modulus
   of the membrane in the direction of muscle fibers, yielding IAP values
   recorded under the partial Valsalva maneuver. In the FE model, the
   abdominal cavity is cylindrical and filled with a nearly incompressible
   fluid. The surrounding muscles are modeled as membrane elements with
   transverse isotropic material properties simulating their fiber
   orientation. Results indicate a good qualitative agreement between the
   analytical and FE models. Larger external force and/or higher levels of
   muscle activation generate higher IAP thereby increasing spinal
   stiffness. These effects are more pronounced for activation of muscles
   with more horizontally directed fibers, e.g., transverse abdominis (TA).
   The capacity of the abdominal muscles to indirectly unload and stabilize
   the spine by generating IAP depends mostly on their fiber orientation,
   and secondarily on their cross-section area.}},

   doi:10.1152/ajpheart.01044.2011.-Endothelialdys function and oxidative
   stress contribute to the atherosclerotic process that includes
   stiffening of large peripheral arteries. In contrast, our laboratory
   previously reported a paradoxical increase in cerebrovascular compliance
   in LDLr-/-:hApoB(+/+) atherosclerotic (ATX) mice (7). We hypothesized
   that prevention of cerebral artery endothelial dysfunction with a
   chronic dietary antioxidant intake would normalize the changes in
   cerebral artery wall structure and biomechanics and prevent the decline
   in basal cerebral blood flow associated with atherosclerosis.
   Three-month-old ATX mice were treated, or not, for 3 mo with the
   polyphenol (+)-catechin (CAT; 30 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) and compared with
   wild-type controls. In isolated, pressurized cerebral arteries from ATX
   mice, CAT prevented endothelial dysfunction (deterioration of
   endothelium-dependent, flow-mediated dilations; P < 0.05), the inward
   hypertrophic structural remodeling (increase in the wall-to-lumen ratio;
   P < 0.05), and the rise in cerebrovascular compliance (rightward shift
   of the stress-strain curve measured in passive conditions, reflecting
   mechanical properties of the arterial wall; P < 0.05). Doppler optical
   coherence tomography imaging in vivo confirmed these findings, showing
   that cerebral compliance was higher in ATX mice and normalized by CAT (P
   < 0.05). CAT also prevented basal cerebral hypoperfusion in ATX mice (P
   < 0.05). Active remodeling of the cerebrovascular wall in ATX mice was
   further suggested by the increase (P < 0.05) in pro-metalloproteinase-9
   activity, which was normalized by CAT. We conclude that, by preserving
   the endothelial function, a chronic treatment with CAT prevents the
   deleterious effect of severe dyslipidemia on cerebral artery wall
   structure and biomechanical properties, contributing to preserving
   resting cerebral blood flow.}},

Abstract = {{We numerically evaluate efficient wideband wavelength converters based
   on quasi-phase-matched cascaded sum and difference frequency generation
   (SFG + DFG) using step-chirped gratings (SCG) in lossy lithium niobate
   waveguides, and compare them to the ones using uniform gratings,
   assuming a large pump wavelength difference considering a full model of
   depleted pump and sum-frequency waves. For the same length, appropriate
   critical period shifts are presented for the number of sections and
   chirp steps to achieve flattop conversion efficiency responses with
   peak-to-peak ripples less than 0.2 dB. To obtain the maximum efficiency
   and flat response with a decreasing chirp step of 1 nm, the criteria for
   the design of optimum four-section single-pass and two-section
   double-pass SCG-based devices, including the assignment of length (to
   achieve a desired bandwidth) and pump power, are presented considering a
   75-nm pump wavelength difference. Also, the performances of single-pass
   and double-pass schemes for the two-and four-section SCG-based devices
   are given, respectively, and compared to those of uniform grating-based
   devices with and without pump detuning, assuming a 3-cm-long waveguide
   and 50-mW input pump powers. For the same length and power, using the
   SCG with fixed pumps instead of the uniform grating with detuned pumps
   shows a noteworthy increase in the mean efficiency to attain almost the
   same response flatness and bandwidth.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we present an efficient technique for the accurate
   design of wideband substrate integrate waveguide directional couplers.
   By tapering the coupling section, the bandwidth of substrate integrated
   waveguide (SIW) directional couplers can be enlarged. Two design aspects
   are involved in this approach. First, the even-mode propagation constant
   in the tapered coupling section is accurately extracted with the help of
   a numerical thru-reflect-line calibration technique. Then, it is fitted
   into the model of a uniform dielectric-filled rectangular waveguide and
   thereafter extrapolated to the operation range of the odd mode. Second,
   equivalent circuit models of the waveguide bifurcation effects are also
   presented together with parametric values. Based on the results of
   extraction, a 90 degrees 3-dB directional coupler is developed to
   validate the proposed design approach. To achieve the reverse phasing at
   two output ports, the prototyped 90 degrees 3-dB directional coupler is
   subsequently integrated with a novel broadband fixed phase shifter
   developed with the SIW technology, of which a systematic synthesis
   procedure has been proposed in this article. Measured performance of
   both 90 degrees and 180 degrees 3-dB couplers confirms the accuracy of
   our proposed design approach. This kind of wide-band directional coupler
   can find applications in wideband power dividing/combining circuits
   within a single-layer platform. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Int J

Abstract = {{Human U-937 monocytes are notoriously reluctant to adhere to normally
   cell-adhering surfaces, for example tissue-culture poly(styrene). In
   earlier work, these laboratories observed that organic thin films
   prepared by plasma- or ultraviolet-assisted polymerisation, so-called
   PVP:N, did facilitate the adhesion and proliferation of U-937 under the
   condition that the concentration of primary amines exceed a critical
   value, {[}NH2]crit?=?4.2?at.\%. That criterion being satisfied by
   pristine Parylene diX AM, we have compared its performance with those of
   particular types of PVP:N, L-PPE:N and UV-PE:N. Here, we report a study
   of aging of these coating types in atmospheric air, then of
   time-dependent adhesion of U-937 cells. Although there are similarities,
   the coatings also manifest interesting differences that so far elude
   detailed understanding.}},

Abstract = {{We present a joint structural inversion algorithm for cross-hole
   electrical resistance tomography (ERT) and cross-hole radar travel time
   tomography (RTT) that encourages coincident sharp changes on a smoothly
   varying background in the two models. The proposed approach is based on
   the combination of two iterative soft-thresholding inversion algorithms
   in parallel manner where the structural information is exchanged at each
   iteration. Iterative thresholding algorithm allows to obtain a sparse
   wavelet representation of the model (blocky model) by applying a
   thresholding operator to the wavelet coefficients of model obtained
   through a Gauss-Newton iteration. The structural information is
   introduced in the inversion system using the smoothness weighting
   matrices that control boundary cells and the thresholds that are
   estimated by maximizing a structural similarity criterion, which is a
   function of the two (ERT and RTT) models. A Canny edge detector is
   implemented to extract the structural information. The detected edges
   serve to build a weighting matrix that is used to alter the smoothness
   matrix constraint. To validate our methodology and its implementation,
   tests were performed on three synthetic models. The results show that
   the parameters estimated by our joint inversion approach are more
   consistent than those from individual inversions and another joint
   inversion algorithm. In addition, our approach appears to be robust in
   high noise level conditions. Finally, the proposed algorithm was applied
   for vadose zone characterisation in a sandstone aquifer. It achieves
   results that are consistent with hydrogeological information and
   geophysical logs available at the site. The results were also compared
   in terms of structural similarities to models obtained by a joint
   structural inversion algorithm with a cross-gradient constraint. Based
   on this comparison and hydrogeologic information, we conclude that the
   proposed algorithm allows to the RTT and ERT models to be dissimilar in
   the areas where the data are incompatible. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Simulation tools for Liquid Composite Moulding (LCM) processes are a key
   to predict and solve manufacturing issues. Despite the fact that
   numerical process analyses are commonly used to predict mould filling,
   resin cure and exothermic temperatures, more comprehensive computational
   tools are still required. Resin additives such as low profile additives
   (LPA) show a significant impact on process performance and part quality.
   In this work, mould pre-heating experiments were compared to numerical
   predictions using commercial simulation software. Non-isothermal
   simulations were then carried out and the predicted flow and
   degree-of-cure evolution were compared to experiments. Finally, a volume
   change model, previously developed, was implemented in this work to
   calculate mould pressure increases in RIM of resins with four different
   LPA contents (0\%, 5\%, 10\% and 40\%). The predictions were compared to
   the results from the mould pressure transducers in the mould cavity.
   Simulation results matched closely with the experimental results.
   Pressure evolution of low profile resins was found to be very sensitive
   to the model parameters. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of this study were to extract the intrinsic mechanical
   properties of the growth plate at four different stages of growth and to
   compare two different methods of extracting these properties. Porcine
   distal ulnar growth plate samples were obtained from newborn, 4-, 8-,
   and 18-week (W) pigs and were tested using stress relaxation tests under
   unconfined compression. A four-parameter curve fitting procedure was
   developed to extract mechanical properties using the Transversely
   Isotropic Biphasic Elastic model(TIBPE) (Cohen et al. in J Biomech Eng
   Trans Asme 120(4):491-496, 1998) and the Differential Evolution (DE)
   optimization algorithm (Price et al. Natural computing series, Springer,
   Germany 2005). Optimization was done on all experimental curves for the
   first method and on one average experimental curve per developmental
   stage in the second. The 4-week stage was studied in two subgroups (a)
   and (b) due to distinct differences in mechanical properties. Intrinsic
   mechanical properties of the growth plate varied nonlinearly with
   developmental stage. Both methods showed that transverse and
   out-of-plane Young's moduli (E (1), E (3)) decrease with developmental
   stage, whereas transverse permeability (k (1)) increases. The exception
   is a sharp increase in stiffness and reduction in permeability at the
   4W(a) stage, which may be associated with rapid porcine developmental
   changes at the 3-4 week period. The second method provides a more
   reliable representation of the average mechanical behavior, whereas the
   first method allows statistical comparison of optimized mechanical
   properties. This study characterizes, for the first time, the variation
   in growth plate mechanical properties for the same animal (porcine) and
   bone (ulna) model with developmental stage and provides new insight into
   the progression of musculoskeletal diseases during growth spurts in
   response to mechanical loading.}},

Abstract = {{During alloy and process design, it is often desired to identify regions
   of design or process variables for which certain calculated functions
   have optimal values under various constraints, for example, compositions
   of minimum liquidus temperature in an N-component alloy; compositions
   where the amount of precipitate in a given phase is maximized or
   minimized during annealing or rolling; other calculated functions such
   as densities, vapor pressures and viscosities; or the overall cost. The
   present work reports on the development of software, linked to the
   FactSage thermodynamic and property database system, to perform such
   calculations. The software uses the Mesh Adaptive Direct Search
   algorithm (MADS) designed to solve non-smooth optimization problems for
   which the objectives and constraints are typically outputs of computer
   simulations. Numerical results for several examples are presented. (C)

   shows that annealing temperature has a significant effect on both the

   Sb2S3 films annealed at 300 degrees C exhibits dark conductivity of 1.42
   x 10(-7) S cm(-1). The performance of PV cells strongly depends on
   thermal treatment of Sb2S3, and on the thickness of both the Sb2S3 and

   studied by photoelectron spectroscopy to understand the physics behind.}},

Abstract = {{The encapsulation of aluminum nanoparticles by polyvinylidene fluoride
   (PVDF) was carried out in supercritical conditions via in situ
   polymerization. The aluminum particles possessed an average diameter of
   43.7 nm. The presence of PVDF on the particles was validated by
   thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). This result was further approved by
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which showed high intensity
   peaks of fluorine and carbon on the particles after the encapsulation
   process, which are associated with the presence of hydrocarbon-based
   PVDF. As observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, the
   nanoparticles were uniformly coated by a polymer of a few nanometers in
   thickness. The results showed that there is a good consistency between
   the calculated thickness of the polymer coating and the results obtained
   by TEM. In addition, the effect of polymerization time on the kinetics
   of the reaction was investigated. Finally, it was found that the
   thickness of the polymer layer can be controlled by the duration of the

Title = {{Characterization of the heterotrophic biomass and the endogenous residue

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{653-668}},

Abstract = {{The activated sludge process generates an endogenous residue (X-E) as a
   result of heterotrophic biomass decay (X-H). A literature review yielded
   limited information on the differences between X-E and X-H in terms of
   chemical composition and content of extracellular polymeric substances
   (EPS). The objective of this project was to characterize the chemical
   composition (x, y, z, a, b and c in CxHyOzNaPbSc) of the endogenous and
   the active fractions and EPS of activated sludge from well designed
   experiments. To isolate X-H and X-E in this study, activated sludge was
   generated in a 200 L pilot-scale aerobic membrane bioreactor (MBR) fed
   with a soluble and completely biodegradable synthetic influent of sodium
   acetate as the sole carbon source. This influent, which contained no
   influent unbiodegradable organic or inorganic particulate matter,
   allowed the generation of a sludge composed essentially of two
   fractions: heterotrophic biomass X-H and an endogenous residue X-E, the
   nitrifying biomass being negligible. The endogenous decay rate and the
   active biomass fraction of the MBR sludge were determined in 21-day
   aerobic digestion batch tests by monitoring the VSS and OUR responses.
   Fractions of X-H and X-E were respectively 68\% and 32\% in run 1 (MBR
   at 5.2 day SRT) and 59\% and 41\% in run 2 (MBR at 10.4 day SRT). The
   endogenous residue was isolated by subjecting the MBR sludge to
   prolonged aerobic batch digestion for 3 weeks, and was characterized in
   terms of (a) elemental analysis for carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and
   sulphur; and (b) content of EPS. The MBR sludge was characterized using
   the same procedures (a and b). Knowing the proportions of X-H and X-E in
   this sludge, it was possible to characterize X-H by back calculation.
   Results from this investigation showed that the endogenous residue had a
   chemical composition different from that of the active biomass with a
   lower content of inorganic matter (1:4.2), of nitrogen (1:2.9), of
   phosphorus (1:5.3) and of sulphur (1:3.2) but a similar content of
   carbon (1:0.98). Based on these elemental analyses, chemical composition
   formulae for X-H and X-E were determined as
   CH1.240O0.375N0.200P0.0172S0.0070 and CH1.248O0.492N0.068P0.0032S0.0016,
   respectively. Data from EPS analyses also confirmed this difference in
   structure between X-E and X-H with an EPS content of 11-17\% in X-E
   versus 26-40\% in X-H. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study analyzed the long-term cartilage and subchondral bone repair
   of microdrilled defects treated with chitosan glycerol-phosphate/blood
   implant, using thrombin (Factor IIa) to accelerate in situ
   solidification. We also evaluated the cartilage repair response to six
   smaller microdrill holes compared with two larger holes. Bilateral knee
   trochlear cartilage defects were created in n = 8 skeletally mature
   rabbits, drilled with six proximal 0.5 mm and two distal 0.9 mm holes,
   then covered with in situ-solidified IIa-implants (treated) or with
   IIa-alone (control). After 6.5 months of repair, cartilage repair
   tissues were analyzed by histological scoring and histomorphometry for
   hyaline matrix characteristics and osseous integration. Subchondral
   repair bone was analyzed by 3D microcomputed tomography and compared to
   acute defects (n = 6) and intact trochlea (n = 8). Implant-treated
   cartilage repair tissues had higher structural integrity through the
   entire defect (p = 0.02), twofold higher percent staining for
   glycosaminoglycan (p = 0.0004), and similar to 24\% more collagen type
   II staining over the smaller drill holes (p = 0.008) compared with
   controls. Otherwise, hole diameter had no specific effect on cartilage
   repair. The subchondral bone plate was partially restored in treated and
   control defects but less dense than intact trochlea, with evidence of
   incomplete regeneration of the calcified cartilage layer. More residual
   drill holes (p = 0.054) were detected in control versus treated defects,
   and control defects with more than 40\% residual holes presented
   abnormally thicker trabeculae compared with treated defects. Low
   osteoclast numbers after 6.5 months repair suggested that bone was no
   longer remodeling. The subchondral bone plate surrounding the defects
   exhibited a significant thickening compared with age-matched intact
   trochlea. These data suggest that debridement and drilling can lead to
   long-term subchondral bone changes outside the cartilage defect.
   Compared with drilled controls, chitosan implants solidified with
   thrombin elicited a more hyaline and structurally integrated
   osteochondral unit, features needed for long-term durability.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To determine overall, test-retest and inter-rater reliability
   of posture indices among persons with idiopathic scoliosis.
   Design A reliability study using two raters and two test sessions.
   Setting Tertiary care paediatric centre.
   Participants Seventy participants aged between 10 and 20 years with
   different types of idiopathic scoliosis (Cobb angle 15 to 60 degrees)
   were recruited from the scoliosis clinic.
   Main outcome measures Based on the XY co-ordinates of natural reference
   points (e. g. eyes) as well as markers placed on several anatomical
   landmarks, 32 angular and linear posture indices taken from digital
   photographs in the standing position were calculated from a specially
   developed software program. Generalisability theory served to estimate
   the reliability and standard error of measurement (SEM) for the overall,
   test-retest and inter-rater designs. Bland and Altman's method was also
   used to document agreement between sessions and raters.
   Results In the random design, dependability coefficients demonstrated a
   moderate level of reliability for six posture indices (phi = 0.51 to
   0.72) and a good level of reliability for 26 posture indices out of 32
   (phi >= 0.79). Error attributable to marker placement was negligible for
   most indices. Limits of agreement and SEM values were larger for
   shoulder protraction, trunk list, Q angle, cervical lordosis and
   scoliosis angles. The most reproducible indices were waist angles and
   knee valgus and varus.
   Conclusions Posture can be assessed in a global fashion from photographs
   in persons with idiopathic scoliosis. Despite the good reliability of
   marker placement, other studies are needed to minimise measurement
   errors in order to provide a suitable tool for monitoring change in
   posture over time. (C) 2011 Chartered Society of Physiotherapy.

Abstract = {{To remain competitive and gain new shares of the market, industries must
   develop their products quickly while meeting the multiple customer
   requirements. To reduce product development time, the design step is
   often accomplished by several working groups working in parallel. These
   working groups are often decentralized and are supervised by a director.
   This paper focuses on solving a multi-objective problem in a setting
   that is called a ``decentralized environment.{''} Collaborative
   optimization is a strategy used for solving problems in a decentralized
   environment. This strategy divides a problem into subproblems in order
   to give more autonomy to working groups, thus facilitating work in
   parallel. In this paper, collaborative optimization is paired with an
   interactive algorithm to solve multi-objective problems in a
   decentralized environment. It can be easily adjusted within the
   structure of a development process in a given industry and allows
   collaboration between the director and his/her working groups. The
   algorithm captures the director's and the working groups' preferences
   and generates several Pareto-optimal solutions. The algorithm was tested
   on a two-bar structure problem. The results obtained match those
   published in the literature.}},

   Limit of a Lean Premixed Dump Combustor}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING FOR GAS TURBINES AND POWER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, lean-premixed (LP) combustors have been widely studied
   due to their potential to reduce NOx emissions in comparison to
   diffusion type combustors. However, the fact that the fuels and
   oxidizers are mixed upstream of the combustion zone makes LP type of
   combustors a candidate for upstream flame propagation (i.e., flashback)
   in the premixer that is typically not designed to sustain high
   temperatures. Moreover, there has been a recent demand for fuel-flexible
   gas turbines that can operate on hydrogen-enriched fuels like Syngas.
   Combustors originally designed for slower kinetics fuels like natural
   gas can potentially encounter flashback if operated with faster burning
   fuels like those containing hydrogen as a constituent. There exists a
   clear need in fuel-flexible lean-premixed combustors to control
   flashback that will not only prevent costly component damage but will
   also enhance the operability margin of engines. A successful attempt has
   been made to control flashback in an atmospheric LP combustor, burning
   natural gas-air mixtures, via the application of dielectric barrier
   discharge (DBD). A low-power DBD actuator was designed, fabricated and
   integrated into a premixer made out of quartz. The actuator was tuned to
   produce a low magnitude ionic wind with an intention to modify the
   velocity profile in the premixer. Flashback conditions were created by
   decreasing the air flow rate while keeping the fuel flow rate constant.
   Within this experimental setup, flashback happened in the core flow
   along the axis of the cylindrical premixer. Results show that the
   utilization of the DBD delays the occurrence of flashback to higher
   equivalence ratios. Improvements as high as about 5\% of the flashback
   limit have been obtained without compromising the blowout limit. It is
   anticipated that this novel application of DBD will lead to future
   demonstrations of the concept under realistic gas turbine operating
   conditions. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4004237]}},

Abstract = {{The high cycle fatigue strengths of aluminum-silicon-magnesium 357 alloy
   prepared by permanent molding and semi-solid molding are measured.
   Results show that precipitation hardened permanent mold (PM) and
   semi-solid mold (SSM) materials have fatigue strengths at 10(7) cycles
   of 82 MPa and 113 MPa respectively at R = -1, and of 47 MPa and 78 MPa
   respectively at R = 0.1. For all tested specimens, the propagation of
   short cracks occupies a significant portion of the fatigue life.
   Observation of many short cracks using the replication technique
   indicates that grain boundaries are important microstructural barriers
   to short crack propagation in these materials. It is proposed that the
   fatigue strength at 10(7) cycles of the studied materials is the stress
   amplitude under which a short crack will be stopped by the first grain
   boundary encountered. In the absence of defects bigger than the grain
   size, the average fatigue strength is inversely proportional to the
   square root of the average grain size. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{5344-5355}},

Abstract = {{We propose for the first time an E. coli bacteria sensor based on the
   evanescent field of the fundamental mode of a suspended-core terahertz
   fiber. The sensor is capable of E. coli detection at concentrations in
   the range of 10(4)-10(9) cfu/ml. The polyethylene fiber features a 150
   mu m core suspended by three deeply sub-wavelength bridges in the center
   of a 5.1 mm-diameter cladding tube. The fiber core is biofunctionalized
   with T4 bacteriophages which bind and eventually destroy ( lyse) their
   bacterial target. Using environmental SEM we demonstrate that E. coli is
   first captured by the phages on the fiber surface. After 25 minutes,
   most of the bacteria is infected by phages and then destroyed with
   similar to 1 mu m-size fragments remaining bound to the fiber surface.

Abstract = {{The nanocomposite TiC/a-SiC:H/a-C:H (presented as Ti-Si-C) coatings
   attract considerable interest due to their possible applications such as
   wear protective coatings, diffusion barriers, and materials for solar
   cells and electrical contacts. In order to explore new film properties
   and open new opportunities, in the present work, we prepare a series of
   C-rich Ti-Si-C coatings with different Si and C concentrations using
   plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition, and we systematically
   investigate the effect of elemental composition on the microstructure,
   and on the mechanical, tribological and electrochemical properties. XRD
   and XPS analyses demonstrate that the Ti-Si-C coatings mainly consist of
   nanocrystalline (nc-) TiC embedded in amorphous (a-) SiC: H and a-C: H
   matrices. Ti-Si-C coatings with a high Si concentration possess enhanced
   mechanical properties (high hardness), while those with additional C
   exhibit superior tribological behaviors. The increase of Si and/or C
   concentrations leads to a grain size refinement of the TiC nanocrystals
   and to an expansion of the amorphous phase. This in turn substantially
   enhances their corrosion resistance. Ti-Si-C coatings with the highest
   Si or C contents exhibit the best corrosion performance among the tested
   samples by improving the corrosion resistance of the SS410 substrate by
   a factor of similar to 400. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{In this study, lead sulphide (PbS) particles were synthesized from
   methanolic lead acetate-thiourea (PbAc-TU) complex via various
   precipitation techniques based on the decomposition of methanolic
   PbAc-TU complex. The influence of these techniques on the morphology,
   size and physical properties of PbS particles was studied in details. In
   general, scanning electron microscopy of the PbS particles produced by
   conventional chemical bath deposition, sonochemical bath deposition and
   microwave-assisted chemical bath deposition revealed that they were
   nanostructured with different size and shape. X-ray diffraction
   confirmed their high purity, while X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   (XPS) showed that they were partially oxidized due to their high surface
   energy. Optical absorption, transmission electron microscopy, selective
   area electron diffraction and XPS of capped nanoparticles (NPs) produced
   via capping assisted chemical bath deposition using
   poly(vinyl-pyrrolidone) (PVP) and oleic acid (OA) indicated that narrow
   size distributed PbS NPs absorbed strongly in the visible region with
   cubic crystalline phase without any evidence of surface oxidation.
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of PVP-capped PbS NPs showed
   strong interaction between PbS NPs and polymer matrix, while for
   OA-capped PbS NPs, OA was chemically absorbed on the surface of PbS NPs.

Abstract = {{We systematically investigate the reactive behaviour of two types of
   high-power pulsed magnetron discharges above a Nb target using either
   square voltage pulses (denoted as HiPIMS) or custom-shaped pulses
   (denoted as MPPMS), and compare it with that of a dc magnetron
   sputtering (DCMS) discharge. We demonstrate that the surface metal
   oxides can be effectively sputter-eroded from the target during both
   HiPIMS and MPPMS pulses operated in reactive O-2/Ar gas mixtures, and
   that sputtering from a partially oxide-free target is possible even at
   high oxygen concentrations. This results in a hysteresis-free deposition
   process which allows one to prepare optically transparent high
   refractive index Nb2O5 coatings exhibiting an elevated deposition rate
   without the need for feedback control commonly used in reactive DCMS.
   The cathode voltage was identified as the principal parameter that
   affects the reactive discharge behaviour.}},

Pages = {{1465-1470}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to develop a phosphorus retention
   mechanisms model based on precipitation and crystallization in electric
   arc furnace slag filters. Three slag columns were fed during 30 to 630
   days with a reconstituted mining effluent at different void hydraulic
   retention times. Precipitates formed in columns were characterized by
   X-ray diffraction and transmission electronic microscopy. The proposed
   model is expressed in the following steps: (1) the rate limiting
   dissolution of slag is represented by the dissolution of CaO, (2) a high
   pH in the slag filter results in phosphorus precipitation and crystal
   growth, (3) crystal retention takes place by filtration, settling and
   growth densification, (4) the decrease in available reaction volume is
   caused by crystal and other particulate matter accumulation (and
   decrease in available reaction time), and (5) the pH decreases in the
   filter over time if the reaction time is too low (which results in a
   reduced removal efficiency). Crystal organization in a slag filter
   determines its phosphorus retention capacity. Supersaturation and water
   velocity affect crystal organization. A compact crystal organization
   enhances the phosphorus retention capacity of the filter. A new approach
   to define filter performance is proposed: saturation retention capacity
   is expressed in units of mg P/mL voids.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Codesharing is a widespread practice that allows an airline to put one
   of its flight numbers on a flight operated by a partner airline and
   consider it in its own network. Even though it has been repeatedly
   demonstrated that this type of partnership can generate important
   additional revenue, it is increasingly complex for an airline to choose
   which flights to codeshare with which partners. We propose two heuristic
   methods that maximize the revenue of an airline over a selection of
   potential codeshare flights considering two aspects that were not fully
   considered in the literature: the impact of adding a codeshare flight in
   the network and the interactions that exist between flights that are
   chosen as codeshare. These methods were used to optimize the codeshare
   flight selection of Air Canada. In comparison with two methods currently
   used in the airline industry, the developed algorithms propose codeshare
   flight selections that generate greater revenue.}},

Abstract = {{Integration of an optical waveguide array using four waveguides in a
   Mach-Zehnder (MZ) structure and a two-layer low-loss substrate
   integrated waveguide (SIW) structure is presented to propose a new class
   of electrooptical phase modulators. In the proposed SIW modulator,
   synthesized rectangular waveguide in planar form is used as
   ``electrodes{''} to guide millimeter-wave signals instead of
   conventional coplanar waveguide (CPW) for an electrooptical modulator,
   thus providing low-loss non-TEM mode propagation. In this study, two
   layers of a lithium niobate (LiNbO) substrate for creating a high field
   interaction between the millimeter-wave and optical signals are
   considered and studied. Fabrication of the proposed structure by
   titanium diffusion in an LiNbO substrate as the optical waveguides and
   laser micromachining of the SIW via-holes has been done. The validation
   of our simulated results is also performed by the measurement of
   CPW-to-SIW transitions in the LiNbO substrate. Optical loss of 0.8 dB/cm
   at the wavelength of 1550 nm is obtained for an MZ structure using an
   optical waveguide array consisting of four waveguiding channels. In

Abstract = {{Partial meniscectomy is believed to change the biomechanics of the knee
   joint through alterations in the contact of articular cartilages and
   menisci. Although fluid pressure plays an important role in the load
   support mechanism of the knee, the fluid pressurization in the
   cartilages and menisci has been ignored in the finite element studies of
   the mechanics of meniscectomy. In the present study, a 3D
   fibril-reinforced poromechanical model of the knee joint was used to
   explore the fluid flow dependent changes in articular cartilage
   following partial medial and lateral meniscectomies. Six partial
   longitudinal meniscectomies were considered under relaxation, simple
   creep, and combined creep loading conditions. In comparison to the
   intact knee, partial meniscectomy not only caused a substantial increase
   in the maximum fluid pressure but also shifted the location of this
   pressure in the femoral cartilage. Furthermore, these changes were
   positively correlated to the size of meniscal resection. While in the
   intact joint, the location of the maximum fluid pressure was dependent
   on the loading conditions, in the meniscectomized joint the location was
   predominantly determined by the site of meniscal resection. The partial
   meniscectomy also reduced the rate of the pressure dissipation,
   resulting in even larger difference between creep and relaxation times
   as compared to the case of the intact knee. The knee joint became
   stiffer after meniscectomy because of higher fluid pressure at knee
   compression followed by slower pressure dissipation. The present study
   indicated the role of fluid pressurization in the altered mechanics of
   meniscectomized knees. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4005764]}},

Abstract = {{Lame modulus (lambda) and shear modulus (mu) are among the most
   important, intrinsic, elastic constants of rocks. Using and mu could be
   much more advantageous than using P- and S-wave velocities (Vp and Vs).
   Here we quantified these equivalent isotropic elastic moduli for 115
   representative rocks from the ultrahigh pressure (UHP) metamorphic
   terrane of the Dabie-Sulu erogenic belt (China) and their variations
   with pressure (P), temperature (T), density (p), Vp, Vs and minera
   logical composition. Both moduli increase nonlinearly and linearly with
   increasing pressure at low (<200-300 MPa) and high (>200-300 MPa)
   pressures, respectively. In the regime of high pressures, and mu
   decrease quasi-linearly with increasing temperature with temperature
   derivatives d?/dT and d mu/dT generally in the range of 10 x 103 to 1 x
   103 GPa/degrees C. Dehydration of water-bearing minerals such as
   serpentine in peridotites and chlorite in retrograde eclogites results
   in an abrupt drop in while mu remains almost unchanged. In -, mu- and
   -mu plots, the main categories of UHP rocks can be characterized.
   Serpentinization leads to significant decreases in mu and as serpentine
   has extremely low values of , mu and . Eclogites, common mafic rocks
   (mafic gneiss, metagabbro and amphibolite), and felsic rocks
   (orthogneiss and paragneiss) have high, moderate and low mu and values,
   respectively. For pyroxenes and olivines, increases but mu decreases
   with increasing Fe/Mg ratios. For plagioclase feldspars, both and mu
   exhibit a significant positive correlation with anorthite content.
   SiO2-rich felsic rocks and quartzites are deviated remarkably from the
   general trend lines of the acid-intermediate-mafic rocks in Vs-, mu-,
   -Vp, -Vs and mu- diagrams because quartz has extremely low (similar to
   8.1 GPa) and p (2.65 g/cm3) but moderate mu (44.4 GPa) values.
   Increasing the contents of garnet, rutile, ilmenite and magnetite
   results in a significant increase in the and mu values of the UHP
   metamorphic rocks. However, either or mu is insensitive to the
   compositional variations for pyralspite (pyrope-almandine-spessartine)
   solution series. The results provide potentially improved constraints on
   characterization of crustal composition based on the elastic properties
   of rocks and in situ seismic data from deep continental roots.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, IP network planning and design is mostly based on the
   average delay or loss constraints which can often be easily calculated.
   Jitter, on the other hand, is much more difficult to evaluate, but it is
   particularly important to manage the QoS of real-time and interactive
   services such as VoIP and streaming video. In this paper, we present
   simple formulas for the jitter of Poisson traffic in a single queue that
   can be quickly calculated. It takes into account the packets delay
   correlation and also the correlation of tandem queues that have a
   significant impact on the end-to-end jitter. We then extend them to the
   end-to-end jitter of a tagged stream based on a tandem queueing network.
   The results given by the model are then compared with event-driven
   simulations. We find that they are very accurate for Poisson traffic
   over a wide range of traffic loads and more importantly that they yield
   conservative values for the jitter so that they can be used in network
   design procedures. We also find some very counter-intuitive results. We
   show that jitter actually decreases with increasing load and the total
   jitter on a path depends on the position of congested links on that
   path. We finally point out some consequences of these results for
   network design procedures.}},

   admission control and characterize the Whittle index in a closed form.
   This index measures the efficiency of flow data transmission at a

   further implies optimality of threshold policies. We apply the results

Abstract = {{Toxic cyanobacteria threaten the water quality of drinking water sources
   across the globe. Two such water bodies in Canada (a reservoir on the
   Yamaska River and a bay of Lake Champlain in Quebec) were monitored
   using a YSI 6600 V2-4 (YSI, Yellow Springs, Ohio, USA) submersible
   multi-probe measuring in vivo phycocyanin (PC) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a)
   fluorescence, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, temperature, and
   turbidity in parallel. The linearity of the in vivo fluorescence PC and
   Chl-a probe measurements were validated in the laboratory with
   Microcystis aeruginosa (r(2) = 0.96 and r(2) = 0.82 respectively). Under
   environmental conditions, in vivo PC fluorescence was strongly
   correlated with extracted PC (r = 0.79) while in vivo Chl-a fluorescence
   had a weaker relationship with extracted Chl-a (r = 0.23). Multiple
   regression analysis revealed significant correlations between extracted
   Chl-a, extracted PC and cyanobacterial biovolume and in vivo
   fluorescence parameters measured by the sensors (i.e. turbidity and pH).
   This information will help water authorities select the in vivo
   parameters that are the most useful indicators for monitoring
   cyanobacteria. Despite highly toxic cyanobacterial bloom development 10
   m from the drinking water treatment plant's (DWTP) intake on several
   sampling dates, low in vivo PC fluorescence, cyanobacterial biovolume,
   and microcystin concentrations were detected in the plant's untreated
   water. The reservoir's hydrodynamics appear to have prevented the
   transport of toxins and cells into the DWTP which would have
   deteriorated the water quality. The multi-probe readings and toxin
   analyses provided critical evidence that the DWTP's untreated water was
   unaffected by the toxic cyanobacterial blooms present in its source
   water.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the onset of motion and the resulting convective
   motion in a shallow porous cavity filled with a non-Newtonian binary
   fluid. The two horizontal walls of the system are subject to constant
   fluxes of heat and solute while the two vertical ones are impermeable
   and adiabatic. A power law model is used to characterize the
   non-Newtonian fluid behavior of the binary solution. The governing
   parameters for the problem are the thermal Rayleigh number R-T,
   power-law index n, Lewis number Le, buoyancy ratio phi, aspect ratio of
   the cavity A, normalized porosity xi, and parameter a defining
   double-diffusive convection (a = 0) or Soret induced convection (a = 1).
   An analytical solution, valid for shallow enclosures (A >> 1), is
   derived on the basis of the parallel flow approximation. Criteria, for
   supercritical and subcritical onset of motions, are predicted. In the
   range of the governing parameters considered in this study, a good
   agreement is found between the analytical predictions and the numerical
   results obtained by solving the full governing equations. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{The mixing performance of a Superblend coaxial mixer, which combines a
   Maxblend impeller as the central impeller and a helical ribbon, was
   investigated experimentally in terms of power consumption and mixing
   time. The objective was to better understand the influence of the
   operating conditions on the mixing performance with Newtonian fluids.
   The experiment setup used allows each shaft to be driven independently.
   Taking advantage of individual torque-meter on each shaft and a
   well-developed decolorization technique, it was shown that the speed
   ratio RN (N-maxblend /N-helical (ribbon) = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8) and the
   rotating mode (up- and down-pumping of the helical ribbon) have the
   largest influence on the mixing performance and that there is no
   universal operating mode for minimizing power and mixing time in all
   conditions or flow regimes. The results are presented in terms of the
   power consumption and mixing time throughout the laminar, transitional,
   and turbulent regimes. The contribution of each impeller, the variation
   of flow patterns, the determination of the optimal operating conditions,
   and the comparison of power constant are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Recently surface modification of clay minerals has become increasingly
   important for improving the practical applications of clays and clay
   minerals. In this research work surface modifications of bentonite
   nanoclay particles were carried out by chemical grafting of different
   copolymers including poly(1-vinyl pyrrolidone-co-styrene) (PVP),
   poly(methyl methacrylate-co-methacrylic acid) (PMMA) and poly
   (acrylamide-co-diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride) (PDADMAC). The
   efficiency of the grafting reactions was investigated using FTIR, TGA
   and XRD methods. It was shown that PVP as well as PDADMAC copolymers had
   been grafted successfully on the exterior of the nanoclay tactoids
   surfaces, while most of the PMMA molecules had entered the galleries and
   grafted on the inner surfaces of the nanoclay. Turbidimetry, zeta
   potentiometry and dynamic light scattering (DLS), were employed to
   analyze the dispersion stability of the unmodified and modified
   nanoclays in an electrolyte solution with high salinity. The
   turbidimetry results showed that stabilities of unmodified and modified
   nanoclay particles in the electrolyte solutions decreased as the time
   passed from their preparation, and after 24 h they settled completely in
   the solutions. However, rates of the settlement of unmodified and
   modified particles differed from each other, that of the modified ones
   being lower. This difference was attributed to the grafted copolymers on
   the modified particles surfaces. Also, the results of the zeta
   potentiometry and DLS were in harmony with the turbidimetry
   observations.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, the airline crew scheduling problem has been decomposed
   into a crew pairing problem and a 1 crew assignment problem, both of
   which are solved sequentially. The first consists of generating a set of
   least-cost crew pairings (sequences of flights starting and ending at
   the same crew base) that cover all flights. The second aims at finding
   monthly schedules (sequences of pairings) for crew members that cover
   all pairings previously built. Pairing and schedule construction must
   respect all safety and collective agreement rules. In this paper, we
   focus on the pilot crew scheduling problem in a bidline context where
   anonymous schedules must be built for pilots and high fixed costs are
   considered to minimize the number of scheduled pilots. We propose a
   model that completely integrates the crew pairing and crew assignment
   problems, and we develop a combined column generation/dynamic constraint
   aggregation method for solving them. Computational results on real-life
   data show that integrating crew pairing and crew assignment can yield
   significant savings-on average, 3.37\% on the total cost and 5.54\% on
   the number of schedules for the 7 tested instances. The integrated
   approach, however, requires much higher computational times than the
   sequential approach.}},

Abstract = {{Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems vendors face great challenges
   to enhance their market position and maximize their profits. Being able
   to simultaneously predict the diffusion of an ERP and to determine the

Abstract = {{We revisit the mechanism leading to the photoresponse of locally

Title = {{Macroanalysis of the economic and environmental impacts of a 2005-2025

Abstract = {{This paper describes a new tool to assess the medium- and long-term
   economic and environmental impacts of large-scale policies. The approach
   - macro life cycle assessment (M-LCA) - is based on life cycle
   assessment methodology and includes additional elements to model
   economic externalities and the temporal evolution of background
   parameters. The general equilibrium model GTAP was therefore used to
   simulate the economic consequences of policies in a dynamic framework
   representing the temporal evolution of macroeconomic and technological
   parameters. Environmental impacts, expressed via four indicators (human
   health, ecosystems, global warming and natural resources), are computed
   according to policy life cycle and its indirect economic consequences.
   In order to illustrate the approach, two 2005-2025 European Union (EU)
   energy policies were compared using M-LCA. The first policy, the
   bioenergy policy, aims to significantly increase energy generation from
   biomass and reduce EU energy demand for coal. The second policy, the
   baseline policy, is a business as usual policy where year 2000 energy
   policies are extended to 2025. Results show that, compared to the
   baseline policy, the bioenergy policy generates fewer impacts on three
   of the four environmental indicators (human health, global warming and
   natural resources) at the world and EU scales, though the results may
   differ significantly at a regional level. The results also highlight the
   key contribution of economic growth to the total environmental impacts
   computed for the 2005-2025 period. A comparison of the results with a
   more conventional consequential LCA approach illustrates the benefits of
   M-LCA when modeling the indirect environmental impacts of large-scale
   policies. The sensitivity and uncertainty analysis indicates that the
   method is quite robust. However, its robustness must still be evaluated
   based on the sensitivity and uncertainty of additional parameters,
   including the evolution of economic growth. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Comparative analysis of high conversion achievable in thorium-fueled
   slightly modified CANDU and PWR reactors}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{171-189}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We study here the conversion performance of thorium-fueled standard or
   only slightly modified CANDU and PWR reactors with unchanged core
   envelope and equipments, to be eventually used as the third and last
   tier of symbiotic scenarios. For instance, plutonium extracted from the
   spent fuel of UOX PWRs could be converted in Th/Pu CANDUs to uranium
   (mainly U-233), finally used to feed a thorium-fueled water-cooled high
   converting third component. This could be a convenient way to replace
   likely delayed Generation IV in the case of an important increase of
   uranium-based energy demand. In order to assess the competitiveness of
   such symbiotic scenarios, detailed burnup and conversion data are
   obtained by means of a core-equivalent simulation methodology developed
   for CANDU-6 and adapted to N4-type PWR.
   Once-through cycles in CANDU are firstly evaluated for various Th/Pu and
   Th/U-233 fuels as regards detailed conversion and basic safety
   performance. Breeding in Th/(233) U CANDU is achieved for a 1.30 wt\%
   homogeneous fissile enrichment and a relatively short burnup of 7 GWd/t.
   Small increase of enrichment (to 1.35 wt\%) considerably extends cycle
   length (to 14 GWd/t) at the cost of slight sub-breeding. Heterogeneity
   of fissile load can bring another 70\% gain on burnup with no
   significant impact on conversion. Multirecycling gives even shorter
   burnup (about 5 GWd/t) for the breeding case, while performance close to
   the once-through 1.35 wt\% case is obtained for a slightly sub-breeding
   regime sustained by a small add of uranium from Th/Pu CANDU. Th/U cycle
   neutronic analysis explains the convenient feature of almost constant
   burnup as U-233 load is unchanged at each recycle. Two symbiotic
   scenarios based on UOX PWRs, Th/Pu CANDUs and Th/U-233 CANDUs in a first
   open version or optimized Th/U CANDUs in a second closed version are
   compared.
   At standard power and moderation levels, Th/U-233 PWR conversion
   performance is much lower than CANDU with only a bit more than half of
   initial fissile load remaining after 50 GWd/t. Contrary to CANDU, fuel
   heterogeneity does not increase burnup. Conversion is mainly improved by
   enhanced sub-moderation down to minimal acceptable water over fuel
   volume ratio of 0.8 at standard power. In this limit case, a 3.00 wt\%
   enrichment ensures a burnup of 33 GWd/t with 80\% of initial fissile
   load remaining. By comparing a few Th/U-233 CANDU and PWR high
   converting cases, we understand that main part of the CANDU-PWR
   conversion gap results from neutron-economical CANDU operation
   conditions based on frequent online refueling and therefore why
   sub-moderation improves PWR conversion. From this better understanding,
   we deduce and preliminarily evaluate two possible ways to really higher
   conversion with thorium fuel in PWR envelope based on faster spectra
   either with light water and power derating or with heavy water and
   Spectral Shift Control. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   and PEO compositions in the nanofibrous mats were determined by TGA
   analysis, which were similar to their ratio in the feed solutions, The
   local compositional homogeneity of the membranes and the efficiency of
   the washing step to remove PEO were also verified by FTIR. In addition,
   DSC and XRD were used to characterize the crystalline structure and
   morphology of the co-electrospun nonwoven mats. The prepared coaxial

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose two different designs of micromachined
   Fabry-Perot optical cavities, with first motivation of improving the
   quality factor (Q-factor) and in the same time allowing increased cavity
   length L. Our approach consists of providing a solution to the main loss
   mechanism in conventional FP cavities related to the expansion of the
   Gaussian light beam after multiple reflections inside the cavity. The
   first design is based on all-silicon cylindrical Bragg mirrors, which
   provide 1-D confinement of light. In addition to wavelength selectivity,
   the first design also demonstrates its potential for a new class of
   applications, including wavelength selective extinction through
   mode-selective excitation, where the fiber-to-cavity distance is used as
   the control parameter. The second design is based on cylindrical Bragg
   mirrors combined with a fiber rod lens to provide a complete solution
   for 2-D confinement of light. This approach outperforms the first design
   in terms of Q-factor, of nearly 9000 for around 250 mu m-long cavity,
   which suggests its potential use for biochemical sensing and analysis as
   well as cavity enhancement applications requiring high Q. L values.

Abstract = {{This article reports an analytical and numerical study of natural
   convection in a shallow rectangular cavity filled with nanofluids.
   Neumann boundary conditions for temperature are applied to the vertical
   walls of the enclosure while the two horizontal ones are assumed
   insulated. Three types of nanoparticles are taken into consideration:
   Cu, Al2O3 and TiO2. Various models are used for calculating the
   effective viscosity and thermal conductivity of nanofluids. The
   governing parameters for the problem are the thermal Rayleigh number,
   Ra, the Prandtl number Pr, the aspect ratio of the cavity, A and the
   solid volume fraction of nanoparticles, Phi. In the first part of the
   analytical study a scale analysis of the present problem is made. In the
   second part analytical solutions are obtained, in the limit of an
   infinite layer (A >> 1), for the stream function and temperature fields.
   The analytical model relies on the assumption of a parallel flow
   approximation in the core region of the cavity and an integral form of
   the energy equation in the end regions. In the high Rayleigh number
   regime a good agreement is obtained between the predictions of the scale
   analysis and those of the analytical solution. Numerical solutions of
   the full governing equations are obtained for a wide range of the
   governing parameters. A good agreement is observed between the
   analytical model and the numerical simulations based on the lattice
   Boltzmann method.}},

Abstract = {{Ethylene-propylene-diene-terpolymer (EPDM) and polypropylene (PP)-based
   uncross-linked and dynamically cross-linked blends were prepared both in
   an internal mixer and in a corotating twin-screw extruder. The effects
   of composition, plasticization and mixing equipment on the morphology
   development and the final viscoelastic properties were studied. In the
   uncross-linked blends, the plasticization resulted in a coarser
   morphology. Furthermore, it was shown that the majority of the
   plasticizer resided in the EPDM phase, enabling its deformation in the
   flow direction. In addition, the intensive mixing conditions inside the
   twin-screw extruder resulted in a finer morphology. In the dynamically
   cross-linked blends, the twin-screw extrusion process resulted in a
   higher level of gel content with larger EPDM domains. The plasticization
   showed again a coarsening effect, resulting in interconnected
   cross-linked EPDM domains. An interesting interfacial phenomenon was
   observed especially in the plasticized vulcanized blends where nanometer
   size occluded PP domains were stripped off and eroded into the EPDM
   phase. With the exception of the nonplasticized uncross-linked blends,
   the viscoelastic properties of all other blending systems were found to
   be directly affected by the morphology, gel content (in the case of
   cross-linked blends), and the presence of the plasticizer. POLYM. ENG.

Abstract = {{Polyethylene terephthalate (PET)/clay nanocomposites (PCNs) containing 1
   wt\% Cloisite 30B (C30B) were prepared via melt compounding. Modulated
   differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC) for isothermally crystallized
   samples revealed that the third endotherm at the highest temperature may
   be attributed to the recrystalization and melting of crystals,
   reorganized during heating. The first and second endotherms may be
   associated with melting of the secondary and primary crystals,
   respectively. The overall isothermal crystallization rate in PCNs was
   faster than in the neat resin. Growth kinetics revealed that the work
   required for chain folding and the equilibrium melting temperature in
   PCNs were somewhat higher than for neat PET. During isothermal
   crystallization, the steric hurdles introduced by clay layers lead to a
   reduction in the transport of the PET chains into crystallites. The
   effective non-isothermal activation energy for the PCNs was higher than
   for PET, possibly leading to less perfect crystals in the PCNs. POLYM.

Abstract = {{Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) nanocomposite films were prepared by
   cast extrusion followed by uniaxial stretching, using chill rolls.
   Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and wide angle X-ray diffraction
   (WAXD) showed that the clay layers were aligned in the machine direction
   (MD) in the PET/clay nanocomposite (PCN) films. Differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC) showed that PCN films have higher crystallinity than
   the neat PET films, possibly due to the nucleating role of the silicate
   layers. The PCN films became hazier as the clay content increased, but
   the film transparency remained in the acceptable range. Oxygen
   permeability of the PCN films decreased by 23\% compared to the neat PET
   film. This is comparable with predictions of models proposed in the
   literature. Silicate incorporation brought about 20\% increase in the
   tensile modulus, while the puncture and tear propagation resistance were
   reduced, due to brittleness of the PCN films. The measured modulus (1.7
   GPa) was somewhat smaller than the values predicted using the

Abstract = {{In this work, we propose a new integrated framework that addresses the

   a RANSAC trajectory-to-trajectory matching, which estimates an affine
   transformation matrix that maximizes the overlapping of thermal and
   visible foreground pixels. Sensor fusion uses the aligned images to
   compute sum-rule silhouettes, and then constructs thermal-visible object
   models. Finally, multiple object tracking uses blobs constructed in
   sensor fusion to output the trajectories. Results demonstrate the
   advantage of our proposed framework in obtaining better results for both
   image registration and tracking than separate image registration and

Abstract = {{In order to predict the self-shielding effect in neutron activation of
   non-spherical samples in reactor neutron spectra, it is important to
   know whether the neutron field is sufficiently anisotropic to cause
   significant variations between horizontal and vertical sample
   orientation or with orientation relative to the direction towards the
   reactor core. Metal wires with significant neutron self-shielding were
   irradiated in several channels of the SLOWPOKE reactor at Ecole
   Polytechnique Montreal and the TRIGA reactor at the JoA3/4ef Stefan
   Institute. In all cases, the amount of thermal or epithermal
   self-shielding was found to be identical, within the experimental
   uncertainty, regardless of the orientation of the wire, indicating that
   the neutron field is essentially isotropic. Models used to predict
   neutron self-shielding need to be adjusted accordingly. In our Monte
   Carlo model, the tube-shaped neutron source was moved back into the
   moderator and reflecting materials near the sample location were
   included, which produced an isotropic neutron field at the sample
   location.}},

Abstract = {{Read-copy update (RCU) is a synchronization technique that often
   replaces reader-writer locking because RCU's read-side primitives are
   both wait-free and an order of magnitude faster than uncontended
   locking. Although RCU updates are relatively heavy weight, the
   importance of read-side performance is increasing as computing systems
   become more responsive to changes in their environments. RCU is heavily
   used in several kernel-level environments. Unfortunately, kernel-level
   implementations use facilities that are often unavailable to user
   applications. The few prior user-level RCU implementations either
   provided inefficient read-side primitives or restricted the application
   architecture. This paper fills this gap by describing efficient and
   flexible RCU implementations based on primitives commonly available to
   user-level applications. Finally, this paper compares these RCU
   implementations with each other and with standard locking, which enables
   choosing the best mechanism for a given workload. This work opens the
   door to widespread user-application use of RCU.}},

Abstract = {{The present work is concerned with the effect of a uniform magnetic
   field on the onset of convection in an electrically conducting
   micropolar fluid. A flat fluid layer bounded by horizontal rigid
   boundaries, subjected to thermal boundary conditions of the Neumann
   type, is considered. The parallel flow approximation is used to predict
   analytically the critical Rayleigh number for the onset of convection.
   The onset of motion is found to depend on the Hartmann number Ha,
   materials parameters K, B, lambda, and the micro-rotation boundary
   condition n. A linear stability analysis is carried out to study
   numerically the onset of convection. The predictions of the analytical
   model are found to be in good agreement with the numerical solution. The
   above results are also compared with those obtained numerically for the
   case of a system subject to Dirichlet thermal boundary conditions. (C)

Abstract = {{A detailed study of seismic properties (P and S wave velocities,
   hysteresis, anisotropy and shear wave splitting) has been carried out on
   a unique suite of deep borehole core samples from the Chinese
   Continental Scientific Drilling (CCSD) project, which penetrated 5158 m
   into the Sulu ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) metamorphic terrane (China).
   Seismic velocities of the deep core samples are more and less sensitive
   to pressure in the low pressure (<200-300 MPa) nonlinear and high
   pressure (>200-300 MPa) linear regimes, respectively, than samples from
   the surface. The comparison suggests that the high pressure data from
   the core samples are much more reliable for extrapolation to deeper
   crust than the data from surface analogs that have been subjected to
   long histories of weathering and alteration along intergranular and
   transgranular cracks. The significant increases in the pressure
   sensitivity of seismic velocities for the core samples in the nonlinear
   regime indicate that drilling-induced and stress-relief microcracks with
   small aspect ratios are fresh and clean without secondary mineral
   in-fillings, and are thus easy to close completely under the applied
   hydrostatic pressure conditions of the laboratory. The data also
   elucidate that the velocity-pressure data can successfully provide
   important hints about the preferred orientation of microcracks that
   causes P wave velocity anisotropy and shear wave splitting in cracked
   rocks, and that the effect of compression on the V-p/V-s ratios is
   negligible for crack-free compacted rocks. The seismic velocities of
   equivalent isotropic (fabric-free) and crack-free crystalline aggregates
   calculated from room pressure single crystal elastic constants using the
   Voigt average are in good agreement with the laboratory data at similar
   to 200 MPa. Comparison of the seismic reflection image from the vicinity
   of the borehole with the normal-incidence reflection coefficient profile
   computed from the laboratory-measured velocities and densities infers
   that the seismic reflections originate from mafic (eclogite and
   retrograde eclogite) or ultramafic units within dominantly felsic rocks.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater contaminant plumes often display a curvilinear anisotropy
   which conventional kriging and geostatistical simulation approaches
   generally fail to reproduce. In this paper, we use a physically relevant
   coordinate transformation in order to improve the kriging of contaminant
   plumes in 2D. The proposed coordinate transformation maps the Cartesian
   grid into the natural coordinates of flow: the hydraulic head and the
   stream function. This simplifies the specification of a nonlinear
   anisotropy by modifying the spatial relationships between grid points.
   The computation of the natural coordinates, however, requires the
   availability of a flow model, which often needs to be defined using
   limited data. For this reason, a data integration procedure is included
   in the methodology to support the use of the natural coordinate
   transformation in real cases. The performance of the approach is tested
   on two synthetic test cases where it produces concentration maps that
   are more accurate than those obtained with Cartesian coordinates
   kriging. These test cases also highlight some limitations of the
   approach. Whereas the transformation enables kriging to account for
   advection, results show the need to consider dispersion as well. Further
   work is also required to generalize the approach to 3D cases and to
   groundwater flow including wells and sources. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1), a blood glucose homeostasis modulating
   incretin, has been proposed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes
   mellitus (T2DM). However, native GLP-1 pharmacokinetics reveals low
   bioavailability due to degradation by the ubiquitous dipeptydil
   peptidase IV (DPP-IV) endoprotease. In this study, the glucosamine-based
   polymer chitosan was used as a cationic polymer-based in vitro delivery
   system for GLP-1, DPP-IV resistant GLP-1 analogues and siRNA targeting
   DPP-IV mRNA. We found chitosans to form spherical nanocomplexes with
   these nucleic acids, generating two distinct non-overlapping size ranges
   of 141-283 nm and 68-129 nm for plasmid and siRNA, respectively. The low
   molecular weight high DDA chitosan 92-10-5 (degree of deacetylation,
   molecular weight and N:P ratio (DDA-Mn-N:P)) showed the highest plasmid
   DNA transfection efficiency in HepG2 and Caco-2 cell lines when compared
   to 80-10-10 and 80-80-5 chitosans. Recombinant native GLP-1 protein
   levels in media of transfected cells reached 23 ng/L while our DPP-IV
   resistant analogues resulted in a fivefold increase of GLP-1 protein
   levels (115 ng/L) relative to native GLP-1, and equivalent to the
   Lipofectamine positive control. We also found that all chitosan-DPP-IV
   siRNA nanocomplexes were capable of DPP-IV silencing, with 92-10-5 being
   significantly more effective in abrogating enzymatic activity of DPP-IV
   in media of silenced cells, and with no apparent cytotoxicity. These
   results indicate that specific chitosan formulations may be effectively
   used for the delivery of plasmid DNA and siRNA in a combination therapy
   of type 2 diabetes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to quantify the performance of two Well-known
   mixing mechanisms used in microreactors: the split-and-recombination
   (SAR) and the multilamination by means of an interdigital structure. The
   residence time distribution (RTD) and the mixing performance in laminar
   flow regime were experimentally characterized by the tracer pulse-input
   technique and the iodide-iodate Villermaux/Dushman method. RTD analysis
   indicates bypassing caused by uneven flow distribution in the manifolds
   of both microreactors. A decrease of the quadratic dependence of axial
   dispersion on fluid velocity is produced by the improved tracer
   homogenization achieved in the microfluidic structures. The
   iodide-iodate method shows that below a critical Damkohler number the
   microreactors exhibit a superior mixing performance than a conventional
   T-junction. The interdigital microreactor displayed the best mixing
   capabilities for all the flow conditions investigated. However, the
   estimation of energy dissipation confirms that the improved mixing
   performance of the interdigital unit is obtained at the expense of
   greater energy expenditure when compared with the
   split-and-recombination microreactor.}},

Abstract = {{High-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) is a pulsed DC
   sputtering technique utilizing high power density peaks of typically
   more than 100 W cm(-2). The discharge operation at such elevated powers
   can be hindered by the magnetron configuration (size and magnetic field)
   and/or the target conditions (e. g., material and thickness). In
   addition, target erosion is an important issue significantly affecting
   process reproducibility. In the present work, we propose a simple
   approach for the stabilization of the HiPIMS discharge by controlling
   the target magnetic field using paramagnetic spacers with different
   thicknesses in between the magnetron surface and the target. We
   demonstrate a straightforward discharge optimization, while using
   various target materials, such as Nb, Ta, Cr, Al, Ti, Si, and even C
   (graphite). The existence of a steady state high density discharge above
   the graphite target and the other targets in general is discussed in
   terms of the magnetic field configuration and the gas rarefaction
   effect. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Chitosan reacetylation kinetics and efficiency were studied in
   water-methanol (MeOH) mixtures. The polymer was dissolved using acetic
   acid and acetic anhydride was used for reacetylation. Combining
   second-order kinetics and acid-base dissociation equations of chitosan,
   and using acetic anhydride hydrolysis rates determined by conductivity
   measurements, reacetylation reaction rate constants of 187, 108,46
   min(-1) M(-1) were found in 0.50 and 80\% MeOH (v/v), respectively.
   Contrary to previous literature, it was found that improvement in
   reacetylation efficiency in the presence of MeOH is mainly due to an
   increase of acetic acid pK(a) by MeOH that limits the ionization of the
   polymer in the course of the reaction rather than to a decreased acetic
   anhydride hydrolysis rate, as previously thought. Based on these
   insights, the model developed in this study was able to predict the
   significantly reduced efficiency of the reaction for a large extent of
   reacetylation, without requiring any steric hindrance from the acetyl
   group. Conditions to maximize the reaction efficiency for a large extent
   of reacetylation were identified. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A method is presented to predict the root mean square displacement
   response of an open curved thin shell structure subjected to a turbulent
   boundary-layer-induced random pressure field. The basic formulation of
   the dynamic problem is an efficient approach combining classic thin
   shell theory and the finite element method, in which the finite elements
   are flat rectangular shell elements with five degrees of freedom per
   node. The displacement functions are derived from Sanders' thin shell
   theory. A numerical approach is proposed to obtain the total root mean
   square displacements of an open curved thin structure in terms of the
   cross spectral density of random pressure fields. The cross spectral
   density of pressure fluctuations in the turbulent pressure field is
   described using the Corcos formulation. Exact integrations over surface
   and frequency lead to an expression for the total root mean square
   displacement response in terms of the characteristics of the structure
   and flow. An in-house program based on the presented method was
   developed. The total root mean square displacements of a curved thin
   blade subjected to turbulent boundary layers were calculated and
   illustrated as a function of free stream velocity and damping ratio. A
   numerical implementation for the vibration of a cylinder excited by
   fully developed turbulent boundary layer flow was presented. The results
   compared favorably with those obtained using software developed by Lakis
   and Paidoussis U. Sound Vib. 25 (1972) 1-27) using cylindrical elements
   and a hybrid finite element method. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Contrary to paradigm, magnetron discharge runaway cannot always be
   related to self-sputtering. We report here that the high density
   discharge can be observed with all conducting targets, including low
   sputter yield materials such as carbon. Runaway to a high density

   with the recycling of gas atoms in the magnetic field-affected
   pre-sheath. A generalized runaway condition can be formulated, offering
   a pathway to a time-dependent model for high-power impulse magnetron
   sputtering that includes rarefaction and an explanation for the

Abstract = {{A large number of polyester nanocomposite batches featuring different
   kinds of nanoclay surface modifiers and up to 6 wt \% nanoclay were
   manufactured using a solvent-based technique. Montmorillonite platelets
   modified with ammonium ions of different chemical architectures were
   examined to study the effect of ammonium ions on the extent of surface
   reactions with long-chain fatty acids. The ammonium montmorillonite was
   first dispersed and suspended in acetone. This suspension was further
   esterificated with dotriacontanoic (lacceroic) acid to form high density
   brushes on the clay surface. This led to achieving higher basal plane
   spacing of the montmorillonite platelets due to the reduction of
   electrostatic interactions holding them. The outcome of the surface
   esterification was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
   (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The esterificated ammonium-modified
   clays were then mixed by five different mixing strategies based on the
   use of a three-roll mill mixer (TRM) and/or ultrasonication (US) to
   obtain the desired polyester-nanoclay dispersion, intercalation, and
   exfoliation. The dispersion states of the modified nanoclay in polymer
   were characterized from XRD, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and low
   and high magnification transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
   Mechanical, thermal, and barrier properties of the resulting composites
   were experimentally characterized. The Mori-Tanaka method along with an
   orientation distribution function was used to verify the experimental
   effective stiffness of the polyester nanocomposite systems. The aspect
   ratio of nanoclays and their level of intercalation and/or exfoliation
   after mixing were also confirmed by the comparison of the experimental
   diffusivity results with those of Fick's diffusion model. Systems having
   4 and 6 wt \% esterificated ammonium nanoclay and prepared according to
   a combined TRM/US mixing procedure showed optimal performance with
   balanced properties and processing ease, thereby showing potential for
   use in the automotive, transportation, and packaging industries.}},

   both spectral shifts and intensity changes in the fiber transmission. As
   a proof-of-principle demonstration, we characterize sensor performance
   using a set of NaCl solutions with different concentrations. The
   experimental sensitivity of the Bragg fiber sensor is found to be

   Bragg fiber sensing system to replace the grating-based monochromator,
   which could potentially lead to significant cost-saving and increased
   sensing speed. In summary, we demonstrate an all-photonic-bandgap-fiber

Abstract = {{Providing a wideband RF and DC grounding is an essential requirement in

   presents a simple architecture for RF and DC grounding based on

   and one butterfly ended in a via hole which performs as a joint RF and
   DC ground. Simulation results of the proposed structure and comparison
   with other available structures of RF and DC grounding shows that this
   simple structure provides more bandwidth at the operating frequency (3
   GHz bandwidth at the center frequency of 24 GHz). To verify the proposed
   technique, a prototype of this structure was fabricated and
   experimentally tested. Measurement results are in close agreement with
   the results obtained by simulations. Therefore, the approach to
   achieving a simple architecture for providing RF and DC grounding with
   more bandwidth is validated.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a continuous-wave radar system for vital signs detection
   is proposed and demonstrated. The radar operates at both 12 GHz and 24
   GHz (first harmonic) within the same transceiver, in order to improve
   the system accuracy. This harmonics-diversity system is designed with
   multi-band (dual-band in this case) or wideband components (mixer,
   coupler, etc.), then providing a very compact and efficient radar
   architecture. It is shown that the use of an adequate phase shift
   between both signals (12 and 24 GHz) in this case suppresses all the
   null points, a well-known problem in bio-medical Doppler radar. These
   null points appear at specific distances where the power output of the
   mixer in the receiver is almost zero. The phase shift enhances the
   sensitivity of the system without increasing significantly its
   complexity. Theoretical and experimental results are presented to
   validate the analysis and the proposed concept.}},

   via holes of irregular shape are used to suppress higher-order mode
   excitation commonly observed in waveguide couplers. Prototypes have been

   across the 85-115 GHz band show an isolation level higher than 35 dB, an
   average insertion loss of 3.75 dB, a coupling factor of 27 dB and a
   reflection coefficient better than -16.7 dB. The phase difference
   between the direct and coupled ports is 94.3 degrees +/- 2.3 degrees. In
   the 83-111 GHz band and in the case of the 3 dB coupler, isolation is
   higher than 20 dB, insertion losses are 4.2 dB +/- 0.6 dB, and the

   in which the structure is steered to desired shapes by microactuators

   first mapping the nonhomogeneous partial differential equation to a
   standard boundary control form. Then, a combination of the methods of
   energy multiplier and motion planning is used so that the closed-loop

Abstract = {{Emerging systems such as smart grids or intelligent transportation
   systems often require end-user applications to continuously send
   information to external data aggregators performing monitoring or
   control tasks. This can result in an undesirable loss of privacy for the
   users in exchange of the benefits provided by the application. Motivated
   by this trend, we introduce privacy concerns in a system theoretic
   context, and address here the problem of releasing filtered signals that
   respect the privacy of the input data stream. We rely on a formal notion
   of privacy introduced in the database literature, called differential
   privacy, which provides strong privacy guarantees against adversaries
   with arbitrary side information, and extend this notion to dynamic
   systems. We then describe methods to approximate a given filter by a
   differentially private version, so that the distortion introduced by the
   privacy mechanism is minimized. Two specific scenarios are considered,
   where users either provide independent input signals or contribute
   events to a single integer-valued stream.}},

   might be highly polysemic and potentially related to many different

   Information Retrieval techniques can be used. Most of those involves
   contextual words to estimate wich exact textual entity have to be

Abstract = {{Shot peening is a surface treatment that consists of bombarding a
   ductile surface with numerous small and hard particles. Each impact
   creates localized plastic strains that permanently stretch the surface.
   Since the underlying material constrains this stretching, compressive
   residual stresses are generated near the surface. This process is
   commonly used in the automotive and aerospace industries to improve
   fatigue life. Finite element analyses can be used to predict residual
   stress profiles and surface roughness created by shot peening. This
   study investigates further the parameters and capabilities of a random
   impact model by evaluating the representative volume element and the
   calculated stress distribution. Using an isotropic-kinematic hardening
   constitutive law to describe the behaviour of AA2024-T351 aluminium
   alloy, promising results were achieved in terms of residual stresses.}},

Abstract = {{Shot peening consists of projecting multiple small particles onto a
   ductile part in order to induce compressive residual stresses near the
   surface. Peen forming, a derivative of shot peening, is a process that
   creates an unbalanced stress state which in turn leads to a deformation
   to shape thin parts. This versatile and cost-effective process is
   commonly used to manufacture aluminum wing skins and rocket panels. This
   paper presents the finite element modelling approach that was developed
   by the authors to simulate the process. The method relies on shell
   elements and calculated stress profiles and uses an approximation
   equation to take into account the incremental nature of the process.
   Finite element predictions were in good agreement with experimental
   results for small-scale tests. The method was extended to a hypothetical
   wing skin model to show its potential applications.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The internal efforts in the human body in motion could
   provide valuable information for the evaluation and follow-up of
   subjects with musculo-skeletal pathologies, such as scoliosis, but are
   still difficult to accurately measure. In this context, the objective of
   this study is to compare the lombo-sacral (L5-S1) joint efforts during
   gait (i. e.: mediolateral forces, mediolateral torques, and
   anteroposterior torques) between typically developed adolescents (TDA)
   and adolescents with left lumbar or thoracolumbar idiopathic scoliosis
   (AIS), categorized by their Cobb angle (CA). Material and methods: 12
   TDA, 10 AIS with CA < 20, 13 AIS with CA between 20 and 40 as well as 16
   AIS in preoperative condition performed gait at 4 km/h on instrumented
   treadmill. Among the latter group, 8 AIS were evaluated after surgical
   intervention (participants with at least a diminution of 30 of their
   CA). The acquisition system measured the human body joint motion via
   optokinetic sensors, and the ground reaction forces via a treadmill
   fitted with force sensors. The L5-S1 intervertebral efforts were
   calculated using a tridimensional inverse dynamical model of the human
   body. Results: The mediolateral forces were significantly higher for AIS
   with CA between 20 and 40 and for AIS in pre-operative condition
   compared to TDA values. But neither mediolateral nor anteroposterior
   torque was significantly different between groups. After surgical
   intervention the maximal anteroposterior torque was significantly lower
   compared to pre-surgical value. Conclusion: The participants with severe
   idiopathic scoliosis present higher L5-S1 mediolateral forces than TDA,
   which could lead to a supplementary asymmetric vertebra growth
   modulation and the progression of the scoliotic deformities in the
   framework of the Hueter-Volkman principle. Further research should
   include the tridimensional reconstruction of the spine in order to
   observe differences between categories of AIS patients in terms of
   dynamical behaviors along the spine.}},

Abstract = {{The Rib Vertebra Angle Difference (RVAD) as defined by Mehta (1972) is
   used to predict the progression of early onset scoliosis. No clear
   physical significance has been established for this measurement. The
   purpose of this study was to evaluate the RVAD along the thoracic spine
   and the equivalent measurement on 3D reconstructions of the spine and
   rib cage of early onset scoliosis patients in order to determine their
   relationship with the geometry of the chest wall and evolution along the
   spine. The RVAD was measured on PA radiographs of 42 infantile scoliotic
   patients (Cobb >20 degrees) from T4 to T10 according to the method
   described by Mehta. The RVAD 3D was computed using the same landmarks
   from the 3D reconstruction generated from the calibrated biplanar
   radiographs. Cases were divided into Phase I and Phase II using Mehta's
   classification based on the rib head overlap with the apical vertebral
   body on coronal plane radiographs. A linear relationship exists between
   the Metha (2D) and 3D RVAD for both Phase I (r = 0.87) and Phase II (r =
   0.78) patients. For more severe deformities (RVAD 3D >= 35 degrees), a
   relationship was found between RVAD 3D and the axial rotation of the
   thoracic vertebrae (r = 0.51) in Phase II patients. However, no
   significant relationship exists between axial rotation and RVAD 3D for
   Phase I patients as well as Mehta's RVAD. Maximal RVAD measurements were
   located 2 1/2 levels above the apical vertebra. Results indicated that
   RVAD 3D provides additional information to Mehta's RVAD on the torsional
   nature of the deformity. Considering the importance of clinical indices
   to assess the progression of early onset scoliosis, this study raises
   some questions on looking solely at the RVAD measured on radiographs at
   the apical vertebra of Phase I patients and suggests considering also
   levels above the apex of the scoliotic curve and 3D measurements.
   Further investigation is required to fully understand the 3D nature of
   the spine and rib cage deformities.}},

   risk factors with respect to PJK. For this purpose, a biomechanical
   model has been developed and used to test three factors: the sagittal
   balance, the implant type used at the upper instrumented vertebra (UIV)
   and the proximal dissection (posterior ligaments disruption and joint
   capsule degeneration). The preliminary results showed that the PJK is
   correlated to both sagittal balance and the reduction of spinal
   stability due to posterior ligaments disruption and joint capsule

Abstract = {{Clinical studies reveal remarkable variation in screw patterns, or screw
   density in spinal instrumentation. Screw density may have a great impact
   on blood loss, operative time, radiation, risk of screw malposition, and
   cost. Thus, there is a need to understanding of the biomechanical
   effects of screw density so as to minimize the number of pedicle screws
   while ensuring safe and effective instrumentation. The objective of this
   study was to compare the deformity correction effects and bone-screw
   loadings of different pedicle screw densities in spinal instrumentation
   for scoliosis treatment. Spinal instrumentation simulations were
   performed on three scoliosis patients using 3 screw density patterns
   (low, preferred, and high screw density) proposed by two experienced
   surgeons and basic correction techniques: concave rod attachment, rod
   derotation, apical vertebral derotation, and convex side rod attachment.
   Simulation results showed that all tested screw densities generated
   quite similar correction, with differences between the achieved
   corrections all below 3 degrees. The average bone-screw forces were 244
   +/- 67N, 214 +/- 66 N, and 210 +/- 71 N, respectively for low,
   preferred, and high densities. It remains a complex challenge balancing
   the benefit of load sharing between more implants with the
   overconstraints and limited degrees of freedom introduced by the
   increased number of implants. Studies on additional screw densities and
   patterns proposed by more surgeons for a variety of cases, and using
   more diverse correction techniques are necessary to draw stronger
   conclusions and to recommend the optimal screw density.}},

Abstract = {{Iliac screws used in long instrumentation for deformity treatment are
   subject to large forces, which may sometimes lead to fixation failures
   (intra-and postoperatively). The objective of this study was to analyze
   the biomechanics of iliac screw fixations. The study was based on a
   patient-specific simulation of a neuromuscular scoliosis case with a
   long instrumentation to the pelvis. A multi body flexible model was
   created using a preoperative 3D reconstructed spine and pelvis. The side
   bending radiographs were used to personalize the mechanical properties.
   The instrumentation construct was modeled as rigid bodies and flexible
   beams connected by kinematic joints. Three instrumentation parameters
   were studied: the connector length, the inter rod connectors and the use
   of sacral screws. The simulations showed that the forces and torques at
   the iliac screws were lowered by 9\% and 25\% respectively by reducing
   the lateral connector length (from 20 to 10 mm). An inter rod connector
   did not significantly reduce the iliac screw loads. Sacral screws
   reduced the functional loads on the iliac screws, but hardware related
   problems may be shifted onto the sacral screws. Sacral screws in
   conjunction with inter rod connectors reduced the loads at iliac screws
   without overloading the sacral screws. The preliminary results showed
   that the forces at the iliac screws could be lowered through different
   instrumentation parameters. In the next step of the study, the model
   validation will be further completed and used to evaluate other
   instrumentation factors by means of an experimental design framework.
   The knowledge of loading biomechanics at the iliac screw fixation is
   important for finding solutions to reduce the risk of failure, such as
   improving preoperative planning, instrumentation techniques and iliac
   screw construct design.}},

Abstract = {{Surgical navigation systems are useful for planning pedicle screw
   positioning and guiding drilling trajectories. However, it is not yet
   possible to intraoperatively predict the correction of the scoliotic
   spine resulting from specific screw and rod configuration and
   instrumentation maneuvers. In this context, the objective of this study
   is to develop a novel intraoperative simulator for navigated scoliotic
   spine surgeries. An instrumentation strategy (pedicle screw insertion,
   rod attachment and rotation, set screw tightening) was computationally
   simulated on a synthetic model of a scoliotic spine using the
   preoperative radiographs in the standing position and various parameters
   recreating the preoperative conditions. The intraoperative decubitus
   position was then simulated. The resulting geometry was identified using
   a navigation system and transferred to the simulator, which enabled the
   updating of the preoperative planning, computing of clinical indices
   (Cobb angles, etc.) and simulation of instrumentation maneuvers. The
   Cobb angle decreased from 34 degrees to 24 degrees between the simulated
   pre- and intraoperative spine (before the instrumentation). Difference
   in pedicle screw positioning between the preoperative planning and the
   intraoperative situation was less than 0.5 mm. The intraoperative
   simulation of the rod attachment and rotation maneuvers resulted in a 12
   degrees Cobb angle. In conclusion, this preliminary study is a first
   step toward developing an integrated simulator for preoperative planning
   and intraoperative navigation of scoliotic spine surgeries. Once
   completed, the new intraoperative simulator will enable the surgeon to
   obtain real-time biomechanical feedback during the navigated surgery of
   a scoliotic spine, and may contribute to improve the resulting
   correction and instrumentation parameters (instrumented levels, surgical
   maneuvers, generated forces, etc.).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate and evaluate the performance of
   incremental relaying and relay selection, when used in the context of
   cognitive radio networks. Assuming that a number of cognitive radio
   relay nodes N (N >= 2) are co-located with simultaneous primary and
   secondary transmissions, the ``best{''} relays are chosen to assist the
   primary and/or the secondary transmission(s) (in case of decoding
   failure at the destination(s) using the direct link source-destination).
   The outage probability of both primary and secondary systems is
   investigated and the associated power allocation problem analyzed.
   Results show that incremental relaying allows to improve greatly the
   secondary outage probability with respect to a primary outage
   probability threshold, compared to the non-cooperative case. Moreover,
   they suggest that selecting at first the ``best{''} relay to assist the
   primary transmission before the one that would assist the secondary
   transmission is more beneficial than choosing at first the ``best{''}
   relay that would help the secondary transmission. Finally, by proposing
   an adequate transmit power allocation scheme, we bypass the secondary
   transmissions' blocking at low primary Signal-to-Noise-Ratio.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we present results on mathematical modelling of polymeric
   yield stress fluids which have the properties of both elastic solids and
   fluids. Our research is based on the approach of multiphase continuum

   processes. Reducing the consumption of both utilities is important from
   both an economic and environmental point of view. A new method for water

   minimizes thermal energy consumption, design of water allocation
   networks that satisfy those requirements, and finally, selection of the
   optimal configuration. The application of this method to the case study

Abstract = {{The biorefinery concept is emerging as a promising solution to transform
   the pulp and paper industry and improve the fundamental business model,
   including the development of more robust planning approaches that
   consider overall supply-chain profitability. Products manufactured by
   biorefineries will certainly face market price volatility because they
   will replace or substitute for fossil-based products. Several strategies
   can be used to mitigate this risk of market volatility such as financial
   hedging, vertical integration, and partnerships, but also manufacturing
   flexibility. With better planning and management of process flexibility,
   production and procurement costs can be reduced while maximizing
   revenues. The objective of this paper is to study the benefits and
   implications of manufacturing flexibility in a multi-product
   biorefinery. A case study of a newsprint mill is used that implements a
   biorefinery based on wood fractionation producing ethanol, hemicellulose
   sugars, furfural, and lignin. These are sold both as specialty chemicals
   and as fuels. Supply-chain planning is optimized under different market
   scenarios using a tactical model formulated as a mixed-integer linear
   program with a profit maximization objective. Results of the case study
   show that, for a multi-product biorefinery, feedstock and throughput
   flexibility can have significant impacts on the profitability of
   operations and can therefore be useful for mitigating market volatility.
   In certain market scenarios, exploiting manufacturing flexibility can
   increase EBITDA by up to 15\%. The results also show the importance of
   designing biorefinery processes with manufacturing flexibility to
   benefit from sales and procurement opportunities.}},

Abstract = {{Flow induced excitation forces in heat exchangers cause tube-support
   interactions. The long-term interaction is an important phenomenon which
   may cause fretting-wear of the tubes. Experimental tests of the
   interaction show the occurrence of stick-slip intermittent behavior in
   the tube response. Many factors are involved to precisely predict the
   interaction behavior including flow excitation forces, impact and
   friction forces. One of the explanations behind the intermittent
   stick-slip behavior may be interpreted by refinements in the conceptual
   choice of friction model and coefficient of friction. Therefore, among
   the factors above, the incorporated friction model plays an important
   role in The determination of the level of fretting-wear in the system.
   The friction model should satisfy two important criteria: the. first
   important aspect is the strategy of the friction model to detect the
   cessation of sticking, the beginning of partial slipping and
   establishment of the sliding region. The second important aspect is
   defining a friction coefficient function for the entire system response
   to precisely represent the transient stick-slip regions. In the present
   work, the velocity limited friction model was compared with the LuGre
   model which is a rate dependent friction model. The effect of varying
   the break-away force and Stribeck effect on the stick-slip region was
   also investigated. Furthermore, the criteria to demarcate the stick-slip
   region in the LuGre model are discussed and a different method to
   incorporate the Stribeck effect and presliding damping in the Dahl
   friction model are proposed. Finally, a new hybrid spring-damper
   friction model inspired by the Cattaneo-Mindlin stress distribution in
   the contact region is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses mainly on development and application of a hybrid
   finite element approach used for linear and geometrically nonlinear
   vibration analysis of isotropic and anisotropic plates and shells, with
   and without fluid-structure interaction. Development of a hybrid element
   for different geometries of plates and shells is briefly discussed. In
   addition, studies dealing with particular dynamic problems such as
   dynamic stability and flutter of plates and shells coupled to flowing
   fluids are also discussed. This paper is structured as follows: after a
   short introduction on some of the fundamentals of the developed model
   applied to vibrations analysis of shells and plates in vacuo and in
   fluid, the dynamic analysis of anisotropic structural elements is
   discussed. Studies on dynamic response of plates in contact with dense
   fluid (submerged and/or subjected to liquid) follow. These studies
   present very interesting results that are suitable for various
   applications. Dynamic response of shell type structures subjected to
   random vibration due to a turbulent boundary layer of flowing fluid is
   reviewed. Aeroelasticity analysis of shells and plates (including the
   problem of stability; divergence and flutter) in contact with light
   fluids (gases) are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Because of structural complexity, the probability of faults occurring in
   rotating machines is comparatively high. In the case of a problem in the
   rotating machine, the corresponding fault information will often be
   evident in the vibration signals. While fault diagnosis is widely used
   today, the level and types of data analyses employed ( e. g. standard
   statistical and spectral measures) remain fairly simple and often do not
   capture the subtle changes in machine dynamics which could lead to much
   improved machine condition prediction or diagnosis. Ongoing research has
   shown that higher order measures, e. g. multidimensional time-frequency
   presentations, can lead to a much more precise representation of machine
   condition and more importantly can uncover unique dynamical features
   often unattainable via basic 2D analysis. Time-frequency analysis, is
   effective in the detection of faults in machinery and, in certain
   instances, is the most efficient method available for fault diagnosis.
   In the case of time-frequency analysis, the machine state information
   can be expressed either in the form of contour images or grey images.
   The key challenge to successful implementation of TF-analysis in machine
   diagnosis is the development of an accurate and consistent method to
   interpret these images in a manner reflecting the machine condition.
   Once the images are classified correctly; the faults represented by
   vibration signals can be also recognized correctly. In most cases the
   general method is to classify the images directly with technician's
   eyes. This is clearly dependent on human experience and introduces many
   subjective factors and errors in fault diagnosis. Unsurprisingly, the
   recognition results are usually not very good.
   In this paper, Time-frequency domain is used to analyze industrial
   bearings vibration signals. The analysis results are expressed in
   time-frequency images. A back-propagation Neural Network Classifier is
   developed and used to classify the Fourier Descriptors of the
   time-frequency images in order to identify automatically the fault. The
   analysis and experimental results show that the faults of bearing can be
   classified accurately by the proposed methods.}},

Abstract = {{The method of analysis is a combination of Sander's thin shell theory
   and the classic finite element method where the nodal displacements are
   found from the exact solution of shell governing equations rather than
   approximated by polynomial functions. Piston theory with and without a
   correction factor for curvature is applied to derive aerodynamic damping
   and stiffness matrices. The influence of stress stiffness due to
   internal pressure and axial loading is also taken into account.
   Aeroelastic equations in hybrid finite element formulation are derived
   and solved numerically. Different boundary conditions of the shell,
   geometries and flow parameters are investigated. In all study cases the
   shell loses its stability due to coupled-mode flutter. The present study
   shows efficient and reliable results which can be applied for
   aeroelastic design and analysis of shells of revolution in aerospace
   vehicles.}},

Abstract = {{Turbulent boundary layer separation is an important issue for a variety
   of applications, one of which is S-shaped aircraft engine intakes. The
   turbulent separation at the engine intake causes inlet flow distortion,
   which can deteriorate engine performance, cause fatigue and reduce
   engine component life. Various flow control techniques have been applied
   for turbulent boundary layer separation control, such as vortex
   generators, vortex generator jets and synthetic jets. The recent advent
   of dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma actuators can potentially
   provide a robust method for the control of turbulent boundary layer
   separation. Compared to other flow control techniques, these new
   actuators are simple, robust and devoid of moving mechanical parts,
   which make them ideal for aerodynamic applications.
   The present work studies the effects of DBD plasma actuators on the
   suppression of 2-D turbulent boundary layer separation induced by an
   imposed adverse pressure gradient. First, the flow field with and
   without actuation in a low-speed wind tunnel is investigated
   experimentally by Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements. The
   results show that plasma actuation can suppress turbulent boundary layer
   separation in both continuous and pulsed modes. In the pulsed mode, the
   actuation with an optimal actuation frequency, corresponding to a
   dimensionless frequency of order one, is found to most effectively
   suppress the turbulent separation. Moreover, the effects of plasma
   actuation on the flow is demonstrated and analyzed by using Proper
   Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). The effect of the actuation is found to
   be correlated to the second POD mode which corresponds to large flow
   fluctuations.}},

Abstract = {{Following an experimental investigation into suppression of a 2-D
   turbulent boundary layer separation with dielectric barrier discharge
   (DBD) plasma actuators, the present work investigates the concept
   numerically. The purpose is to develop and validate a simulation tool
   that captures the flow physics and carry out a parametric study of the
   concept at flow regimes beyond the current flow control capability of
   plasma actuators of conventional strength. First, a plasma actuator
   model is integrated into the commercial computational fluid dynamics
   (CFD) code ANSYS CFX to simulate the effects of plasma actuation. This
   computational tool is validated through comparison of results with the
   experimental results for pulsed actuation in quiescent air and for the
   control of a turbulent boundary layer separation at low flow velocities.
   It is shown that CFX with an integrated plasma model can capture the
   main experimentally observed effects of DBD actuators on turbulent
   boundary layer separation. Subsequently, this numerical approach is
   used, with increased plasma actuator strength, to study the influence of
   different actuation parameters (e.g., actuation location, direction and
   frequency) on suppression of turbulent boundary layer separation at
   higher flow velocities.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional interconnected microfluidic channels fabricated by the
   direct-write method were infiltrated with SWCNT/epoxy nanocomposites
   under high shear flow to mechanically characterize the effect of
   single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) spatial orientation in
   thermosetting-matrix nanocomposites. The micron-size fugitive ink
   filaments were deposited layer by layer in order to form a scaffold
   followed by its encapsulation by an epoxy resin. Three-dimensional
   interconnected microfluidic channels were then obtained by heat curing
   the encapsulated epoxy followed by fugitive ink removal by liquefying it
   at high temperature under vacuum. To debundle the Laser-ablated
   single-walled carbon nanotubes (La-SWNTs), nitric acid treatment
   following introduction of protoporphyrin IX as surfactant were done to
   prevent reclustering of the CNTs after separation. La-SWNTs were then
   mixed with ultraviolet-curable epoxy using a three-roll mill machine to
   achieve a well-dispersed nanocomposite. The nanocomposites were then
   infiltrated within the empty channels at high pressures to induce shear.
   High shear flow infiltration of nanocomposites will cause the CNTs to be
   aligned in the direction of the channels where an increase in shear
   leads to an increase in CNT alignments. Finally, in order to
   mechanically investigate the effectiveness of the infiltration technique
   and the orientation of SWCNTs, tensile and three-point bending tests
   were done.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional epoxy scaffolds with abundant active epoxy groups on
   surfaces were fabricated through UV-assisted direct-write manufacturing
   process. The prepared scaffolds composed of cylindrical filaments
   (diameter similar to 100 mu m) were aminated by reacting the epoxy
   groups with 1,3-diaminopropane. The resulting aminated scaffolds were
   subsequently biotinylated and then successfully applied to immobilize
   biotinylated nanoclay conjugates via a specific, strong and rapid
   binding of biotin and streptavidin. In another approach, the same amount
   of nanoclays was properly dispersed in epoxy by three-roll mill machine
   inducing high shear mixing. The nanoclay-epoxy filaments were then
   deposited by a computerized-control robot in a 3D micro structure
   scaffold form. Tensile mechanical tests were performed with a dynamic
   mechanical analysis (DMA) using a film tension clamp on three
   microstructures: nanoclay-epoxy scaffolds, aminated-biotinylated
   nanoclays coated on unloaded epoxy scaffolds and finally unloaded epoxy
   scaffolds (used as a reference). DMA tensile measurements indicated a
   slight improvement in modulus (by similar to 5\%), but significant
   increase in strength (by similar to 24\%), fracture strain (by similar
   to 21\%) and fracture energy (by similar to 38\%) by introducing
   biotin-streptavidin strong bonds among epoxy scaffolds and nanoclays in
   comparison with those of mixed nanoclay-epoxy scaffolds. These
   mechanical improvements are attributed to the strong biotin and
   streptavidin bonds between the epoxy scaffolds and nanoclays.}},

Abstract = {{In this research we have addressed the study of the qualitative behavior
   of nonlinear variable speed axial compressors model exhibiting surge and
   stall instabilities. Such a study can shed some light on the development
   of an effective control approach being capable of simultaneously
   controlling the speed and instabilities. The controller can stabilize
   the system around an effective operating point and improve performance
   and reliability of variable speed axial compressors widely used in
   aeronautic industries.
   Although previous studies {[}1, 2] have focused on developing a model
   for non-constant speed axial compressors, qualitative characteristic of
   such a model is still unclear and its active control including both
   rotating stall and compressor speed is still a challenging problem. In
   this study we are particularly interested in investigating effects of
   the acceleration of the compressor rotor on qualitative properties of
   the model. To this end, bifurcation analysis of an axial compressor
   model with spool dynamics was performed and the simulation of the model
   was developed along the way. Preliminary surprising results revealed
   that the type of instability, surge or rotating stall, not only depends
   on the final speed as thought before but is also deeply affected by the
   rate of the rotor acceleration. Impacts of the initial speed on the
   qualitative properties of the model were demonstrated as well.
   Furthermore previous work {[}1, 2] showed that amplitudes of stall
   harmonics grow during the speed transition and cause a temporary
   pressure drop at the compressor output. Our simulation results
   supporting the bifurcation analysis of the model revealed that during
   speed transitions both amplitudes of high order stall harmonics and the
   number of dominant harmonics also depend on the rate of the acceleration
   and the initial speed.}},

Abstract = {{This work investigates the effect of tip clearance size and operating
   temperature on the predictions of the critical rotor speed at which
   Non-Synchronous Vibrations (NSV) can be encountered in a turbine engine
   axial flow compressor. It has been proposed that the tangential tip
   clearance flow, observed at high blade loading near stall, can act as an
   impinging resonant jet on the upcoming blades and could be the
   underlying physics behind NSV. A model, in the form of an equation to
   predict the critical blade tip speed at which NSV can occur, was
   proposed based on the Jet-Core Feedback Theory and was experimentally
   verified by Thomassin et al. {[}8]. In the equation, a factor k that was
   called the ``tip instability convection coefficient{''} was measured
   experimentally and found to be influenced by the tip clearance size and
   operating temperature. This factor has a significant impact on the
   accuracy of the NSV predictions obtained using the proposed model.
   This paper propose a numerical experiment to determine the effect of tip
   clearance size and temperature on k, in order to improve the critical
   NSV tip speed predictions using the proposed model. A review of the NSV
   model is presented along with the relevant background theory on the
   subject. Two different blade geometries are simulated to provide a
   generic approach to the study. The leakage flow velocity is calculated
   to estimate k and a correlation is proposed to model the behavior of the
   k parameter as a function of the tip clearance size. The latter was
   found to significantly improve the critical NSV speed predictions. The
   effect of operating temperature on k is also discussed. Finally, the
   variation of k with the aerodynamic loading is assessed and compared
   with available data in the literature to strengthen the generic nature
   of the results.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents test results of vibration forces in a normal
   triangular tube bundle subjected to air-water cross-flow. The dynamic
   lift and drag forces were measured with strain gage instrumented
   cylinders. The array has a pitch-to-diameter ratio of 1.5, and the tube
   diameter is 38 mm. A wide range of void fraction and fluid velocities
   were tested. The experiments revealed significant forces in both the
   drag and lift directions. Constant frequency and quasi-periodic fluid
   forces were found in addition to random excitation. These forces were
   analyzed and characterized to understand their origins. The forces were
   found to be dependent on the position of the cylinder within the bundle.
   The results are compared with those obtained with flexible cylinders in
   the same tube bundle and to those for a rotated triangular tube bundle.
   These comparisons reveal the influence of quasi-periodic forces on tube
   motions.}},

Abstract = {{Significant two-phase flow-induced forces were previously measured on a
   20 mm diameter U-tubes over a range of homogeneous void fractions. To
   investigate the effect of tube diameter, new experiments were conducted
   using vertical 52 mm diameter U-tubes. In the experiments, two
   parameters were varied, the homogeneous void fraction and the
   homogeneous velocity. All the results were compared with those for the
   smaller diameter tubes. The geometrical characteristics of the smaller
   diameter test sections are similar. LID = 56 and the ratio of the bend
   curvature radius to inner diameter: RID = 4. For all conditions tested,
   we compared the vertical upward flow-patterns for four different tube
   diameters. The observed flow regimes agreed relatively well with those
   predicted from two-phase flow pattern maps, except for the slug/churn
   transition. A specific two-phase flow pattern map is proposed for the 52
   mm diameter tube, using a more accurate transition model from slug to
   churn flow. The forces comparison confirms the dependency with tube
   diameter. The RMS forces were found to increase with tube diameter for
   all void fractions studied. Conversely, the dominant frequency decreases
   with tube diameter, linearly for void fractions of 50 and 75\%.
   Dimensionless forces and spectra for the smaller diameter tubes show
   good data collapse using the proposed model. Two-phase flows in the 52
   mm diameter tube generate lower dimensionless spectra. Finally, a
   dimensionless model is proposed for practical application.}},

Abstract = {{A computer simulation of the vibration of a tube bundle subjected to
   fluidelastic forces induced by two-phase cross flow is carried out. Two
   fluidelastic instability models are compared in the simulations: the
   Connors model and the quasi-steady model. In the quasi-steady model, the
   fluid forces are expressed in terms of the quasi-static drag and lift
   force coefficients and their derivatives which are determined
   experimentally. The consideration of the angle of incidence induced by
   the relative tube displacement with respect to the fluid introduces a
   velocity dependent term in the fluid force expression.
   The simulation has been done using ABAQUS. The ABAQUS user subroutine
   VUEL provides the required interface and information to calculate and
   apply the fluid forces to the structure. The fluidelastic forces applied
   to each element are calculated using the element displacement and
   velocity, the tube instantaneous frequency, a flow retardation parameter
   and the fluid damping and stiffness components.
   A typical U-tube in a steam generator subjected to a non-uniform
   two-phase flow was considered in the simulations. The tube support
   contact was modeled using the ABAQUS contact pair algorithm. The
   Anti-Vibration-Bars (AVB) limiting the tube vibration in the
   out-of-plane direction in the U-bend region were also included in this
   model. As the simulation was nonlinear because of the loose supports, a
   Fast Fourier Transform technique was used to estimate the tube
   instantaneous frequency.
   The quasi-steady fluidelastic force was compared to the fluidelastic
   force of the Connors model. The instability growth rate of the Connors
   model was found to be higher than that of the quasi-steady model. The
   impact forces at the supports and the AVB are also extracted. These
   forces can be used to calculate the work rate and estimate the tube
   wear.}},

Abstract = {{Two-phase cross-flow exists in many shell-and-tube heat exchangers.
   Flow-induced vibration excitation forces can cause tube motion that will
   result in long-term fretting wear or fatigue. Studies on the subject,
   providing results on turbulence-induced displacement, fluid-elastic
   instabilities, and flow patterns have already been performed. It has
   been shown that the flow configuration plays an important role in the
   vibrations excitation mechanism. Previous studies showed the existence
   of unexpected quasi-periodic forces acting on a tube bundle subjected to
   two-phase cross-flow. The present work aims to understand the physical
   origin of these forces. A simple numerical model was developed to
   simulate two-phase cross-flow acting on a tube bundle. This model
   considers a continuous liquid potential flow across a tube bundle, with
   virtual bubbles being introduced in the flow. Three kinds of forces act
   on the bubbles: buoyancy forces, drag forces, and impact forces. These
   forces take place between two bubbles, or between a bubble and a
   cylinder. Two bubbles may coalesce if they hit each then and conversely
   a bubble may split into two bubbles if the shear flow is strong enough.
   These local considerations on bubbles have global consequences on the
   flow configuration. Preliminary results show similarities between the
   numerical flow configuration and the experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) presents a possible approach to
   measuring two-phase flow parameters over a large area, leading to a snap
   shot of flow behavior in complex geometries such as tube bundles.
   Tests have been conducted in a 2m long wavy wall channel simulating the
   open lane within a rotated triangular array. The results show that
   liquid phase PIV measurements must be limited to very low void
   fractions. On the other hand, much information can be gained from the
   gas phase data. The details of the flow structure within the array are
   revealed. Current measurements, performed in the bubbly flow regime,
   show that even in this regime, the flow structure is significantly
   non-uniform and complex. Bubble diameters have been found to be strongly
   dependent on flow velocity; the effect of turbulence shear at high flow
   rates breaking up the bubbles to smaller sizes.
   The PIV measurements yield the complete averaged velocity vector field
   in the measurement region. The velocity profiles across the measurement
   section are also obtained. The non-uniform profiles show the challenges
   associated with attempts to estimate average void fractions and slip
   ratios in the array.}},

   Compared to other reported SIW TSA, this design achieves foot-print
   reduction by a factor of nearly two and excellent radiation pattern
   symmetry. This structure can easily be designed to obtain either 45
   degrees or -45 degrees polarization. Moreover, this single element shows
   advantages over other reported end-fire TSA for arrays, namely, it can
   achieve a lower spacing between elements to obtain reduced side-lobe
   level (SLL) and 45 or -45 degrees polarizations as well as reduced
   coupling between adjacent elements. To feed this antenna, an L-Folded
   SIW (LFSIW) line is introduced. An L-junction from SIW to LFSIW is also
   proposed and studied. The gain of single L-folded element is 13 dBi
   compared to 15.1 dBi for the unfolded antenna. However, the folded
   antenna provides an 8.5 dB improvement in the coupling level between

Abstract = {{In 2006, the first Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of the
   ventilation of specific hydro-generator components were performed at the
   Hydro-Quthec Research Institute (IREQ) and lately the entire ventilation
   circuit is being investigated. Due to the complexity of flow
   calculations, a validation process is necessary and for this reason a
   1:4 scale model of a hydro-generator has been built at IREQ to get
   experimental data by means of particle image velocimetry (PIV). This
   paper presents 2D and 3D simulation results for the scale model obtained
   with a commercial CFD code and addresses the challenges associated with
   the application of CFD to hydro-generators. In particular, the effect of
   rotor-stator interface (RSI) types and configuration is analyzed to
   determine the approach that best suits this application.
   Two-dimensional calculations show that the steady state multiple frames
   of reference (MFR) solution is highly sensitive to the type (frozen
   rotor (FR) vs. mixing plane (MP)) and location of the RSI. A parametric
   study is performed where each interface configuration is compared to the
   transient case results. The MFR-FR interface model produces results that
   may vary significantly depending on the relative rotor position and the
   radial location of the RSI in the air gap. The MFR-MP interface model
   appears to be more coherent with reference values obtained from a
   transient case, since the radial velocity profiles in the stator are
   similar. Furthermore with an appropriate radial positioning of the
   interface, the windage losses are within 20\%. Simulations of the
   complete 3D ventilation circuit revealed a maximum variation of 10\% in
   both total ventilation flow rate and total windage losses, between the
   RSI configurations studied. However, the relative flow distributions,
   normalized with respect to the total flow rate, are unaffected by
   changes in RSI configuration. This paper focuses mainly on sensitivity
   studies to numerical settings, but this comparison still requires
   experimental validation before any final conclusions can be made.}},

Abstract = {{Developers may introduce anti-patterns in their software systems because
   of time pressure, lack of understanding, communication, and-or skills.
   Anti-patterns impede development and maintenance activities by making
   the source code more difficult to understand. Detecting anti-patterns in
   a is important to ease the maintenance of software. Detecting
   anti-patterns could reduce costs, effort, and resources. Researchers
   have proposed approaches to detect occurrences of anti-patterns but
   these approaches have currently some limitations: they require extensive
   knowledge of anti-patterns, they have limited precision and recall, and
   they cannot be applied on subsets of systems. To overcome these
   limitations, we introduce SVMDetect, a novel approach to detect
   anti-patterns, based on a machine learning technique-support vector
   machines. Indeed, through an empirical study involving three subject
   systems and four anti-patterns, we showed that the accuracy of SVMDetect
   is greater than of DETEX when detecting anti-patterns occurrences on a
   set of classes. Concerning, the whole system, SVMDetect is able to find
   more anti-patterns occurrences than DETEX.}},

Abstract = {{This paper assesses the economical benefits of using central electric
   thermal storage (ETS) systems instead of regular electrical heating
   systems. Simulations are performed in order to compare the impact of the
   two heating systems, using as input typical domestic electric
   consumption profile over a one year period. The results are presented
   for two typical Quebec's house. We also consider two types of rates for
   the electricity cost: regular (constant) rates, and Hydro-Quebec's pilot
   project time of use (TOU) rates. The results obtained in this paper are
   also compared to a previous study done in Nova Scotia. Results show that
   the use of ETS heating systems can lead to savings of approximately 15\%
   on annual electrical bill. Finally, we evaluate the impact of using ETS
   on a typical distribution substation load curve for a winter peaking
   week. With TOU rates control, we show that a penetration of
   approximately 4\% central ETS heating systems can create a new
   night-time peak that is as important as the morning peak we are trying
   to mitigate.}},

Abstract = {{Avionics Full Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX) network is an emerging
   Ethernet media based technology for the next generation avionic databus.
   One of the key issues in AFDX networks is to guarantee the data
   transmission delay and optimize the worst case end-to-end delay
   performance in order to meet the requirements of safety-critical
   applications, such as flight control. In this paper, a more accurate
   Virtual Link (VL) model, the Generic Cell Rate Algorithm (GCRA), is used
   to derive a tighter worst case end-to-end delay bound analysis. A
   hierarchical scheduling policy of Fixed Priority combined with Round
   Robin (FP-RR) is then applied to AFDX network entities, and the
   corresponding end-to-end delay bound for different priority classes is
   derived. Finally, the proposed approaches are validated on a
   TrueTime-based simulator platform. The results show that the new GCRA
   model leads to improved performance, and the new end-to-end delay bound
   analysis under FP-RR scheduling policy has higher accuracy in network
   performance evaluation for separate priority classes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of asymptotic tracking control of a
   micro-beam described by Euler-Bernoulli equation actuated by a
   one-dimensional array of micro-actuators. This system represents a
   one-dimensional model of deformable mirrors widely used in wavefront
   control and optical aberration correction in adaptive optics systems.
   The proposed control that allows steering the mirror along smooth
   reference trajectories consists in first mapping the nonhomogeneous
   partial differential equation model of the system into a standard
   boundary control form. Then, a combination of the methods of energy
   multiplier and flatness-based motion planning is used so that the
   closed-loop system is stabilized around reference trajectories. The
   viability and the applicability of the developed scheme is demonstrated
   through numerical simulations.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate several relaying schemes for cooperative
   communications in Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) in order to improve
   the performances of secondary transmissions while respecting a certain
   Quality of Service (QoS) requirement at the primary transmissions. We
   propose relaying schemes where a number of relay nodes, randomly
   located, may help either the primary or the secondary transmission. By
   defining proper relay selection criteria and power allocation schemes,
   we illustrate the secondary outage probability performance while
   guaranteeing the primary QoS. Using simulations, we present the impact
   of different parameters, such as the QoS requirement, the chosen relay
   selection criteria, the number of available relays, the positions of the
   relays, etc., on the secondary transmission performance. The obtained
   results show the potential of the proposed relaying schemes, and provide
   guidelines about the expected secondary performance under the impact of
   several parameters.}},

   better bit error rate performance by using directive reconfigurable
   antennas. To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system, we
   compare the performance of the RE-MIMO with MIMO-OFDM system over
   frequency-selective channels. Simulation results show that the coded
   RE-MIMO system outperforms the coded MIMO-OFDM systems for small angular
   spread. However, for larger angular spread, the performance of the

Abstract = {{Circuit failures due to metastability and single event transients are
   increasing in deep sub-micron technology. Technology scaling is also
   causing degradation in reliability of bi-stable circuits.
   Synchronization circuits that are robust to metastability are important

   In this paper, we address the design and verification of clock domain
   crossing interfaces (CDCs) that connect mutually asynchronous clock
   domains. We propose the use of C-element based synchronizers in clock
   domain crossing interfaces. In order to enhance the Mean Time Between
   Failures (MTBF) of the interface, a new C-element design with an
   improved metastability recovery time is proposed. The new design is
   implemented in 90nm CMOS technology and simulated using SPICE.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new approach for data telemetry from biomedical
   implantable devices to the external world (also known as reverse data
   telemetry). In the proposed approach, while power (and perhaps data) is
   transferred to the implant using a main carrier, a second carrier is
   also sent to the implant through the same link. The second carrier,
   which is of higher frequency and smaller amplitude, is envisioned for
   reverse data telemetry by load-shift keying. In this work, the wireless
   link is realized with two resonant frequencies using closely-coupled
   printed spiral coils and LC matching networks. The main and auxiliary
   carrier frequencies are 1MHz and 10MHz with 5V and 1V peak amplitudes,
   respectively. While the link is capable of continuously supplying
   unregulated power of up to 80mW at 4V(peak) to a 100-Omega resistive
   load, data telemetry at a rate of 100 kbps is successfully tested in the
   reverse direction.}},

Abstract = {{Large FPGAs require more and more time and expertise to efficiently
   target custom applications. This paper presents a new methodology based
   on two configuration levels. At the lowest level, the architecture is
   fully synthesized, placed and routed by experts to implement a 2-D mesh
   architecture of configurable algorithmic token machines. At the highest
   level, the users can program those machines to implement custom
   processing and routing. The architecture is data driven. The operations
   are triggered by the arrival of operands, leading to a large and
   functional pipeline spread over the whole FPGA. This methodology enables
   the fast implementation of data processing algorithms by people who are
   not experts in FPGA design, while achieving higher performances than a
   pure software solution. Two simple examples (FIR and FFT) illustrate the
   proposed methodology and demonstrate how it is possible to benefit from
   the expertise encapsulated at low level by just configuring the high
   level. Another advantage of the proposed methodology is the opportunity
   to dynamically reconfigure the fabric very quickly to best match the
   computation requirements at run time.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of sending and receiving analog signals through a digital
   interconnection network is presented in this paper. The proposed
   ``analog bus{''} addresses limitations of a novel rapid prototyping
   platform called the WaferBoard (TM) that was initially designed to
   support prototyping of all digital circuits with its embedded fully
   digital interconnection network. This paper explores the simplest and
   least area consuming means of propagating analog signals through a
   digital interconnection network. A prototype integrated circuit based on
   the proposed concept was designed using the TSMC 0.18 mu m technology.
   The presented prototype is capable of sending an analog signal in the
   range of 0.6 V to 1.6 V with a maximum frequency of 200 kHz while
   consuming 68x53.4 mu m(2) of chip area and 19.9 mW of power.}},

Abstract = {{In an effort to reduce the productivity gap separating hardware design
   and software programming practices, this paper presents the application
   of our synchronized-transfer-level hardware design methodology to the
   implementation of a hardware matrix multiplication accelerator. The
   methodology builds on a hardware description language for which the
   designer manages dynamic connections between sources and sinks that may
   not always be ready to send or receive data tokens. In addition to these
   connections, the designer can constrain the authorization of data
   transfers by the means of logical rules that make transfers dependant on
   each other. Combining both finite state machine and constraint
   programming paradigms, the featured description language enhances the
   ability to express and exploit low-level parallelism. A compiler
   automates the generation and the optimization of the synchronization
   logic, whose low-level complexity is thus hidden to the designer.
   Applied to the design of the pipelined matrix multiplication circuit,
   the proposed methodology leads to similar computing performances than
   the dedicated designs reported in the literature but within shorter
   design times (a single day), simpler source code and no need for
   advanced hardware design skills.}},

   the information is irrelevant for the task at hand or the information is
   poorly organized. In this paper, we review past research on pilot's
   performance under various levels of visual clutter. We found that this
   research lacks a common rationale to manipulate clutter and we suggest
   such a rationale. We show that models defining clutter as the number of
   elements shown on the display fail to explain recent empirical results
   where displays with minimal clutter do not give the best technical
   flight performance. The paper ends with three suggestions to de-clutter
   a display.}},

Abstract = {{Considering the introduction of new internet protocol (IP) services,
   such as the high definition television (HDTV) over IP (IPTV) service,
   new network architectures and technologies should be introduced for the
   access network to improve the access rate. Actually, the best solution
   is to use the fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) architecture. However, this
   solution is still costly and cannot be widely deployed today. An
   interesting tradeoff is the fiber-to-the-node (FTTN) architecture, which
   reduces the copper portion of the access network. In this paper, we
   propose to tackle the FTTN network planning problem with the objective
   of minimizing the cost of the access network. An integer mathematical
   programming model is proposed for this problem. Next, a heuristic
   algorithm based on the tabu search principle is proposed to find
   ``good{''} feasible solutions within a reasonable amount of
   computational time. Finally, numerical results are presented and

Abstract = {{We propose for the first time an E. coli bacteria sensor based on the
   evanescent field of the fundamental mode of a suspended-core terahertz
   fiber. The sensor is capable of E. coli detection at concentrations in
   the range of 10(4)-10(9) cfu/ml. The polyethylene fiber features a 150
   mu m core suspended by three deeply sub-wavelength bridges in the center
   of a 5.1 mm-diameter cladding tube. The fiber core is biofunctionalized
   with T4 bacteriophages which bind and eventually destroy (lyse) their
   bacterial target. Using environmental SEM we demonstrate that E. coli is
   first captured by the phages on the fiber surface. After 25 minutes,
   most of the bacteria is infected by phages and then destroyed with
   similar to 1 mu m-size fragments remaining bound to the fiber surface.
   The bacteria-binding and subsequent lysis unambiguously correlate with a
   strong increase of the fiber absorption. This signal allows the
   detection and quantification of bacteria concentration. Presented
   bacteria detection method is label-free and it does not rely on the
   presence of any bacterial ``fingerprint{''} features in the THz
   spectrum.}},

Abstract = {{Several issues remain to be addressed for the commercial development of
   Resistive Fault Current Limiters based on superconducting technologies
   (RFCL). In particular, the inhomogeneity of high temperature
   superconducting coated conductors (HTS-CC) combined with the difficulty
   to predict RFCLs behaviour when interfaced with the existing electrical
   grid represents an important bottleneck that limits their
   competitiveness on the electrical market. In order to study the
   influence of the local inhomogeneity of the HTS tape on the global
   effective performance of an RFCL, a modular equivalent circuit model has
   been developed using SimPowerSystems (TM). The model implements an
   inhomogeneity distribution based on statistical data and takes into
   account the thermal conduction between different zones of the HTS-CC. It
   has been calibrated with experimental measurements and finite element
   simulations. The model can be used to study various scenarios common to
   power systems, such as transformer in-rush currents, motor starts, etc.

Abstract = {{Brain abnormalities such as white matter lesions (WMLs) are not only
   linked to cerebrovascular disease, but also with normal aging, diabetes
   and other conditions increasing the risk for cerebrovascular
   pathologies. Obtaining quantitative measures which assesses the degree
   or probability of WML in patients is important for evaluating disease
   burden, and for evaluating its progression and response to
   interventions. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for
   detecting the presence of WMLs in periventricular areas of the brain
   using manifold-constrained embeddings. The proposed method uses locally
   linear embedding (LLE) to create ``normality{''} distributions in 12
   locations of the brain where deviations from the manifolds are estimated
   by calculating geodesic distances along locally linear planes in the
   embedding. A smooth mapping function approximating the relationship
   between ambient and manifold spaces as a joint distribution maps unseen
   test images in the intrinsic space. We create a set of low-dimensional
   embeddings from 876 patches of healthy tissue in 73 subjects and test it
   on 396 patches imaging both WML and healthy areas in 33 subjects with
   diabetes. Experiments highlight the need of nonlinear techniques to
   learn the studied data with detection rates over 85\% in true-positives,
   and the relevance of the computed distance for comparing individuals to
   a specific pathological pattern.}},

Abstract = {{Persistence of external trunk asymmetry after scoliosis surgical
   treatment is frequent and difficult to predict by clinicians. This is a
   significant problem considering that correction of the apparent
   deformity is a major factor of satisfaction for the patients. A
   simulation of the correction on the external appearance would allow the
   clinician to illustrate to the patient the potential result of the
   surgery and would help in deciding on a surgical strategy that could
   most improve his/her appearance. We describe a method to predict the
   scoliotic trunk shape after a spine surgical intervention. The
   capability of our method was evaluated using real data of scoliotic
   patients. Results of the qualitative evaluation were very promising and
   a quantitative evaluation based on the comparison of the simulated and
   the actual postoperative trunk surface showed an adequate accuracy for
   clinical assessment. The required short simulation time also makes our
   approach an eligible candidate for a clinical environment demanding
   interactive simulations.}},

   using ``general-purpose computing on graphics processing units{''}

Title = {{Automated Collection of Pedestrian Data Through Computer Vision
   Techniques}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{2299}},
Pages = {{121-127}},
Abstract = {{New urban planning concepts are being redefined to emphasize walkability
   (a measure of how walker-friendly an area is) and to accommodate the
   pedestrian as a key road user. However, the availability of reliable
   information on pedestrian traffic remains a major challenge and inhibits
   a better understanding of many pedestrian issues. Therefore, the
   importance of developing new techniques for the collection of pedestrian
   data cannot be overstated. This paper describes the use of computer
   vision techniques for the automated collection of pedestrian data
   through several applications, including measurement of pedestrian
   counts, tracking, and walking speeds. An efficient pedestrian-tracking
   algorithm, the MMTrack, was used. The algorithm employed a large-margin
   learning criterion to combine different sources of information
   effectively. The applications were demonstrated with a real-world data
   set from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The data set included
   1,135 pedestrian tracks. Manual counts and tracking were performed to
   validate the results of the automated data collection. The results show
   a 5\% average error in counting, which is considered reliable. The
   results of walking speed validation showed excellent agreement between
   manual and automated walking speed values (root mean square error =
   0.0416 m/s, R-2 = .9269). Further analysis was conducted on the mean
   walking speed of pedestrians as it related to several factors. Gender,
   age, and the group size were found to influence the pedestrian mean
   walking speed significantly. The results demonstrate that computer
   vision techniques have the potential to collect microscopic data on road
   users at a degree of automation and accuracy that cannot be feasibly
   achieved by manual or semiautomated techniques.}},

Title = {{Analysis of Pedestrian Travel with Static Bluetooth Sensors}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{2299}},
Pages = {{137-149}},
Abstract = {{Travel evaluation metrics have been historically biased toward motorized
   modes, which dominate land transportation choices and are partially
   responsible for numerous environmental and health issues facing society
   today. Encouraging active travel solutions is seen as a means of
   improving the sustainability, health, and cohesiveness of a community.
   Unfortunately, information about volume, trip origin and destination,
   travel time, and personal interactions is difficult to obtain because of
   a lack of sensor infrastructure and unrestricted movement of these
   modes. Therefore, information is often limited to annual surveys and
   model estimates that are insufficient to address the increasing needs of
   sustainable planning and large-scale behavior studies. An automated,
   cost-effective approach to acquiring pedestrian data is desirable. The
   emergence of Bluetooth sensors as a means of gathering travel time data
   for traffic analysis presents an opportunity to use the same technology
   for pedestrian travel analysis. However, because people generally carry
   more Bluetooth devices in their vehicles than they do on their person,
   making representative sample sizes is a challenge. A study of pedestrian
   detection with Bluetooth technology is presented at two sites (Montreal,
   Quebec, Canada, and Seattle, Washington) to investigate the feasibility
   of Bluetooth technology for pedestrian studies. The results indicate
   that, given sufficient populations, high-level trend analysis can
   provide insights into pedestrian travel behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Requirements traceability (RT) links help developers to understand
   programs and ensure that their source code is consistent with its
   documentation. Creating RT links is a laborious and resource-consuming
   task. Information Retrieval (IR) techniques are useful to automatically
   recover traceability links. However, IR-based approaches typically have
   low accuracy (precision and recall) and, thus, creating RT links remains
   a human intensive process. We conjecture that understanding how
   developers verify RT links could help improve the accuracy of IR-based
   approaches to recover RT links. Consequently, we perform an empirical
   study consisting of two controlled experiments. First, we use an
   eye-tracking system to capture developers' eye movements while they
   verify RT links. We analyse the obtained data to identify and rank
   developers' preferred source code entities (SCEs), e.g., class names,
   method names. Second, we use the ranked SCEs to propose two new
   weighting schemes called SE/IDF (source code entity/inverse document
   frequency) and DOI/IDF (domain or implementation/inverse document
   frequency) to recover RT links combined with an IR technique. SE/IDF is
   based on the developers preferred SCEs to verify RT links. DOI/IDF is an
   extension of SE/IDF distinguishing domain and implementation concepts.
   We use LSI combined with SE/IDF, DOI/IDF, and TF/IDF to show, using two
   systems, iTrust and Pooka, that LSIDOI/IDF statistically improves the
   accuracy of the recovered RT links over LSITF/IDF.}},

   microspheres were immersed to test the behaviour of the designed LoC.
   One of main features of the proposed LoC platform is its thin thickness,
   including micro-channels and silicon CMOS chip. The latter is integrated
   into the glass top-layer of the LoC measuring 0.5 mm. The size of the
   device is 9 mm x 5 mm. the electrode architecture is composed of 8 x 2 x
   2 L-shaped electrodes in a 650 mu m channel width and 4 sites for
   interdigitited electrodes . 32 L-shaped electrodes were connected to a
   electronics circuit for cells manipulation using dielectrophoresis
   (DEP). The described LoC achieved an efficient separation within a
   concentration of 50 mu l of a solution of microspheres, distilled water
   (DW) and 500 mu l of ACSF. Beyond this concentration, electrode
   destruction was observed.}},

Abstract = {{Combining cognitive radio technology with user cooperation could be
   advantageous to both primary and secondary transmissions. In this paper,
   we propose a first relaying scheme for cognitive radio networks (called
   ``Adaptive relaying scheme 1{''}), where one relay node can assist the
   primary or the secondary transmission with the objective of improving
   the outage probability of the secondary transmission with respect to a
   primary outage probability threshold. Upper bound expressions of the
   secondary outage probability using the proposed scheme are derived over
   Rayleigh fading channels. Numerical and simulation results show that the
   secondary outage probability using the proposed scheme is lower than
   that of other relaying schemes. Then, we extend the proposed scheme to
   the case where the relay node has the ability to decode both the primary
   and secondary signals and also can assist simultaneously both
   transmissions. Simulations show the performance improvement that can be
   obtained due to this extension in terms of secondary outage probability.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses radiation pattern selection in multiple-input
   multiple-output (MIMO) wireless systems. Each receive antenna can be
   reconfigured to P distinct radiation patterns. We select radiation
   patterns in order to maximize instantaneous channel capacity. And we
   prove that for arbitrary correlation the maximum achievable diversity
   order of the pattern selection MIMO (PS-MIMO) system equals to the rank
   of the total correlation matrix of its full system so that the link
   reliability can be significantly improved. We propose a fast selection
   algorithm as the suboptimal solution for channel capacity maximization.
   For PS-MIMO systems over spatially correlated channels, we propose to
   use only a part of available radiation patterns based on the estimation
   of the correlation before performing the pattern search. Simulations are

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new compact switched beam antenna with directional and
   omnidirectional modes is proposed. The antenna employs one connector to
   feed the central element while the switched parasitic elements are
   located symmetrically around the driven element. By changing the state
   of the parasitic elements the beam can be steered in 4 possible
   directions in the azimuth plane. This L-band antenna is designed to
   operate from 1.03 to 1.09 GHz in the both directional and omnidiretional
   mode. The return loss of the antenna in the both modes is less than -10
   dB. In the directional mode, a front to back ratio of better than 10 dB
   is achieved over the frequency band of interest in the azimuth plane.}},

Abstract = {{A Dual-Gridded Reflector (DGR) is a reflector antenna working in dual
   linear polarization (LP) and is widely used on satellites. It allows the
   replacement of two orthogonally polarized reflector systems with
   different coverages by a single aperture system. In this paper, a simple
   prototype of a dual circularly polarized (CP) DGR is presented. It is
   based on a compound of an LP DGR and a three-layer meander-line circular
   polarizer to convert LP waves into CP waves and vice versa. Moreover,
   because of its simple architecture, the proposed structure is low-risk
   and low-cost. The results show that the performances are good enough to
   be used for satellite applications in the Ka transmit band.}},

Abstract = {{Pulp and paper companies need new methodologies to evaluate capital
   spending opportunities using improved cost models and available cost and
   process data. This paper presents an application of the
   operations-driven cost model presented in Part I (Laflamme-Mayer, M.,

   Products and Processes, 1:1 (2011)) to a retrofit design case study
   defined at an existing integrated newsprint mill. The paper outlines the
   structure of the cost model and discusses its application to the
   analysis of a set of design alternatives. The operations-driven cost
   modelling approach significantly increases the granularity and
   transparency of the results obtained from a techno-economic study and
   permits the examination of critical design variables and operating

Abstract = {{Cloud Computing raises major challenges among which virtual machine (VM)
   placement is considered as one of the crucial problems. From the cloud
   provider's perspective, this process often consists in choosing the best
   convenient physical hosts with regards to energy efficiency, resource
   utilization and revenues maximization. However, to secure the loyalty of
   their clients, cloud providers should also consider the applications
   performance. In this paper, we propose a VM placement approach tackling
   the applications performance concern, in an intercloud environment. We
   state the VM placement as a mixed integer programming problem which aims
   to maximize a global utility function considering VM bandwidth
   requirements and network latencies. The proposed approach is evaluated
   with respect to demands and latencies variations; and through numerical
   results, we have demonstrated that our model allows us to compute the
   optimal configuration, in terms of high bandwidth availability and low
   network latency in the overall intercloud environment.}},

Abstract = {{The Avionics Full Duplex Switched Ethernet is a data-link layer protocol
   meant to guarantee deterministic properties, such as bounded end-to-end
   delay, to ensure required quality of service for avionics applications.
   The present work focuses on the latency analysis in transmission at the
   End-System level of such networks. A scheduling policy for handling a
   set of virtual links of identical bandwidth allocation gap size is
   proposed. Network Calculus is applied to the delay upper bound
   computation from the service curve and the arrival curve of End-System.
   The tightest output arrival curve corresponding to the optimal policy in
   terms of aggregate output delays is then obtained. Mathematical analysis
   shows that prioritizing the virtual links with the slowest request rates
   results in the tightest delay bound. An illustrative numerical example
   confirming the validity of the proposed algorithm is provided.}},

Abstract = {{For several applications, such as those with low duty-cycles or
   event-driven activity, for which power consumption is a concern,
   asynchronous circuit design is very appealing. The main advantages are
   decreased power consumption and reduced electromagnetic interference
   (EMI). The NULL Convention Logic (TM) (NCL) paradigm provides an
   interesting way to design such circuits. This paper demonstrates that
   resources usage could be diminished by removing the state-holding
   capability of the 27 NCL gates. In this paper, we propose and discuss an
   effective means to obtain such reduced complexity circuits. The modified
   protocol proposed and validated in this paper leads to a substantial
   reduction, as high as 50\%, of the resources required in a reported
   example. Moreover, by decreasing the number of gates, energy efficiency
   as well as operating frequency may be improved.}},
