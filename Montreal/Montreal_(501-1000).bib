Abstract = {{A dark current compensation technique for low-light image sensors is
   presented in this work. A multi-branch differential integrator circuit
   is proposed to compensate the effect of dark current in CMOS image
   sensors. In order to obtain a low level sensing application, a T-type
   switch with low leakage current is used. The new configuration of
   multiple-input multiple-output differential amplifier has the advantage
   of carefully managing the femto-ampere range dark currents of
   photodiode. The high-sensitivity active-pixel CMOS image sensor using a
   standard TSMC CMOS 0.18 mu m fabrication process has been obtained.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the runtime behavior of a class of multiprocessor
   systems in specific contexts associated with cloud radio access network
   implementation. It specifically deals with task scheduling, run time
   behavior, and their characterization. It also relates to Network
   Functions Virtualization (NFVs) and especially with the constraints
   associated with virtualization of a Long Term Evolution (LTE) stack. To
   validate the effectiveness of different scheduling algorithms, an
   emulation of an LTE uplink virtualized stack is made. Experiments are
   carried out using a runtime system, StarPU, coupled with profiling
   tools, which allows characterizing the need for dedicated threads or
   cores to manage tasks within a server. Reported experimental results
   confirm the feasibility of software scheduling of an LTE uplink stack
   with two of the six tested algorithms. In addition, this paper explores
   distributing the scheduling load across multiple computing units, which
   is more efficient than implementations where the scheduler is
   centralized on a dedicated processor.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate timing prediction for software execution is becoming a problem
   due to the increasing complexity of computer architecture, and the
   presence of mixed-criticality workloads. Probabilistic caches were
   proposed to set bounds to Worst Case Execution Time (WCET) estimates and
   help designers improve system resource usage. However, as technology
   scales down, system fault rates increase and timing behavior is
   affected. In this paper, we propose a Static Probabilistic Timing
   Analysis (SPTA) approach for caches with evict-on-miss random
   replacement policy using a state space modeling technique, with
   consideration of fault impacts on both timing analysis and task WCET.
   Different scenarios of transient and permanent faults are investigated.
   Results show that our proposed approach provides tight probabilistic
   WCET (pWCET) estimates and as fault rate increases, the timing behavior
   of the system can be affected significantly.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a complex three-dimensional
   (3-D) deformation of the trunk, which includes lateral deviation of the
   spine, asymmetric deformation and axial rotation of the vertebrae,
   deformation of the rib cage, and possibly of the pelvis. In order to
   analyze 3-D characteristics of spinal deformations related to AIS, we
   propose a coarse-to-fine 3-D modeling framework of the scoliotic spine
   from biplanar X-ray images. First, the spine centerline represented by a
   cubic spline is used as a data descriptor for the underlying sparse
   modeling approach to obtain an initial 3-D reconstruction. We then
   optimize a multi-object pose+shape model that uses the statistical pose
   and geometric shape variability from a training set of scoliotic spines,
   onto a set of adjusted spinal landmarks to obtain the final 3-D
   reconstruction. The performance was evaluated on a database of 844 AIS
   patients, yielding an overall mean root-meansquare Euclidean distance
   2.4 8 +/- 0.6 8 mm for the final 3-D reconstruction of the scoliotic
   spine.}},

Abstract = {{Transcatheter arterial chemo-embolization (TACE) is a therapeutic
   procedure to treat primary and metastatic liver cancer. It requires
   prior delineation of the hepatic arteries on magnetic resonance
   angiography (MRA) data and identification of the vessels supplying the
   tumor. Manual segmentation is extremely challenging and time consuming,
   thereby increasing the risk of wrongfully identifying the feeding
   vessels. We present a vascular path planning tool for TACE procedures by
   automatically segmenting the hepatic arteries on MRA. The proposed
   method first detects the celiac trunk from the aorta, then localizes and
   tags bifurcations throughout the arterial network for path planning. The
   algorithm is based on a multiple hypothesis tracking approach used to
   propagate deformable mesh surfaces. We validated the proposed framework
   on 20 liver-cancerpatients using abdominal MRA with 20 seconds delay
   after contrast injection. We show that the algorithm improves the
   selectivity of the arterial segments and outperforms two
   state-of-the-art methods with respect to manual segmentation, yielding
   mesh geometries with a mean absolute distance of 0.61 +/- 0.10 mm for 3D
   mesh models.}},

Abstract = {{Debugging is a laborious activity in which developers spend lot of time
   navigating through code, looking for starting points, and stepping
   through statements. Yet, although debuggers exist for 40 years now,
   there have been few research studies to understand this important and
   laborious activity. Indeed, to perform such a study, researchers need
   detailed information about the different steps of the interactive
   debugging process. In this paper, to help research studies on debugging
   and, thus, help improving our understanding of how developers debug
   systems using debuggers, we present the Swarm Debug Infrastructure
   (SDI), with which practitioners and researchers can collect and share
   data about developers' interactive debugging activities.
   We assess the effectiveness of the SDI through an experiment that aims
   to understand how developers apply interactive debugging on five true
   faults found in JabRef, toggling breakpoints and stepping code. Our
   study involved five freelancers and two student developers performing 19
   bug location sessions. We collect videos recording and data about 6
   hours of effective debugging activities. The data includes 110
   breakpoints and near 7,000 invocations. We process the collected videos
   and data to answer five research questions showing that (1) there is no
   correlation between the number of invocations (respectively the number
   of breakpoints toggled) during a debugging session and the time spent on
   the debugging task; rho = 0.039 (respectively 0.093). We also observed
   that (2) developers follow different debugging patterns and (3) there is
   no relation between numbers of breakpoints and expertise. However, (4)
   there is a strong negative correlation between time of the first
   breakpoint (rho = 0.637); and the time spent on the task, suggesting
   that when developers toggle breakpoints carefully, they complete tasks
   faster than developers who toggle breakpoints too quickly.
   We conclude that the SDI allows collecting and sharing debugging data
   that can provide interesting insights about interactive debugging
   activities. We discuss some implications for tool developers and future
   debuggers.}},

Abstract = {{As a consequence of the shortage of traditional resources and escalating
   environmental constraints, the feedstocks for the production of energy
   and chemicals are swiftly changing. Biomass has received remarkable
   attention from both academia and industries as it is the most promising
   feedstock for these applications. Understanding the conversion
   mechanisms of such renewable low-value material to value-added products
   would lead to providing insights to enhance the product yield and/or
   quality and, in turn, help the new products compete with the traditional
   ones. In this regard, this paper provides an updated review on the
   processing of biomass for the production of valuable-products that could
   replace a part of the fossil fuel-based energy and chemicals. The common
   technologies that are performed in the conversion processes are
   demonstrated, and the thermochemical technique is emphasized. Several
   chemical reactors and their processes for fast pyrolysis applications
   are presented. The organic chemistry of pyrolysis of a biomass plant and
   its three constituents (i.e., cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) is
   debated. The effect of the heating mechanism, process parameters,
   loading of catalyst and other aspects are discussed. Eventually, the
   economics aspect of fast pyrolysis of biomass is evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{The Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) architecture and the
   Time-Triggered Ethernet (TTEthernet) network have emerged as the key
   components of a typical architecture model for recent civil aircrafts.
   In this paper, we present a first approach to model and verify avionic
   systems embedded in the Integrated Modular Architecture (IMA) connected
   through the TTEthernet Network, by using TTCC, a real-time concurrent
   constraint process calculus with an operator to define infinite periodic
   behaviors specific to IMA and TTEthernet. We argue that the operational
   constructs for interacting processes with one another of TTCC provide a
   suitable language to describe the time triggered architecture while the
   declarative aspects of this calculus provide a simple and elegant way to
   specify requirements of avionic systems. We also illustrate how TTCC may
   provide a unified framework for the analysis of avionic systems embedded
   in the IMA connected through the TTEthernet by modeling, specifying and
   verifying a case study developed in collaboration with an industrial
   partner, the landing gear system.}},

Abstract = {{Testing for small delay defects (SDDs) is important due to their
   dominance in recent technology nodes. Unfortunately, all the SDD test
   quality metrics in the literature limit their assessment to the size of
   the delay defect tested under at-speed or slower clocks, which makes
   their results misleading under special cases such as
   faster-than-at-speed testing. Moreover, those metrics are inadequate for
   assessing the quality of recent SDD test methods that consider the
   variation of delays in a circuit. In this paper, a novel flexible SDD
   quality metric that can be adapted according to the available
   information and the applied test method is proposed. The proposed metric
   is named Weighted Slack Percentage (WeSPer) as it is defined by a slack
   ratio weighted by confidence level (CL) multipliers. The flexibility
   comes from the ability to model test inaccuracies or delay varying
   effects into the CL multipliers. This paper presents the WeSPer metric,
   along with a CL multiplier that penalizes overtesting to give a more
   accurate assessment of the quality of faster-than-at-speed testing. The
   metric is calculated for several benchmark circuits and compared to
   other SDD metrics found in the literature. The results show that WeSPer
   is better than other metrics at representing the quality of SDD tests,
   especially under faster-than-at-speed testing.}},

   breast mass spicules in 2-D mammography. Spicules are abnormal
   curvilinear structures which characterize most of malignant breast
   masses. They are important features for discrimination between benign
   and malignant masses. In our method, the curvilinear structures are
   first approximated by line segments derived from localized Radon
   transforms; then, the Markov random field is used to take into account
   the local interactions via the contextual information between these
   segments. Finally, detection of the curvilinear structures that most
   likely correspond to spicules is performed using an a contrario
   framework. Validation of the approach was performed on a large dataset
   of spiculated masses which were selected from a public digital database;
   the results showed a high agreement with manually annotated mammograms.}},

Abstract = {{System-level mixed-criticality design aims at reducing production cost
   and enhancing resource efficiency. This paper studies the technology of
   integrating mixed-criticality avionics traffics for Avionics Full-Duplex
   Switched Ethernet (AFDX) network, which can transmit both critical and
   non-critical traffics. These two traffics have different QoS
   requirements, such as low latency for critical traffics and high
   bandwidth for non-critical traffics. We use system-level compositional
   scheduling to integrate mixed-criticality traffics into one network to
   enhance the scalability of AFDX network. In the architecture of the
   proposed compositional scheduling, critical traffics are scheduled by
   bandwidth allocation gap-based scheduler, and non-critical traffics by
   Round Robin manner. To estimate the delay bound meeting requirements of
   applications, end-to-end delay for both critical and non-critical
   traffics are analyzed by using network calculus. Finally, a true
   time-based simulation of AFDX networks is conducted to verify the
   effectiveness of the proposed approach.}},

Volume = {{13}},

Pages = {{924-935}},
Abstract = {{Asbestos amosite fibers were investigated to evaluate the damage caused
   by a transmission electron microscope (TEM) electron beam. Since
   elemental x-ray intensity ratios obtained by energy dispersive x-ray
   spectroscopy (EDS) are commonly used for asbestos identification, the
   impact of beam damage on these ratios was evaluated. It was determined
   that the magnesium/silicon ratio best represented the damage caused to
   the fiber. Various tests showed that most fibers have a current density
   threshold above which the chemical composition of the fiber is modified.
   The value of this threshold current density varied depending on the
   fiber, regardless of fiber diameter, and in some cases could not be
   determined. The existence of a threshold electron dose was also
   demonstrated. This value was dependent on the current density used and
   can be increased by providing a recovery period between exposures to the
   electron beam. This study also established that the electron beam
   current is directly related to the damage rate above a current density
   of 165 A/cm(2). The large number of different results obtained suggest,
   that in order to ensure that the amosite fibers are not damaged,
   analysis should be conducted below a current density of 100 A/cm(2).}},

Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Precise spatial and temporal control of pressure stimulation at the
   nanometer scale is essential for the fabrication and manipulation of
   nano-objects, and for exploring single-molecule behaviour of matter
   under extreme conditions. However, state-of-the-art nano-mechanical
   transducers require sophisticated driving hardware and are currently
   limited to moderate pressure regimes. Here we report a gold plasmonic
   bowtie (AuBT) nano-antennas array that can generate extreme pressure
   stimulus of similar to 100 GPa in the ps (10-12 s) time scale with
   sub-wavelength resolution upon irradiation with ultra-short laser
   pulses. Our method leverages the non-linear interaction of photons with
   water molecules to excite a nano-plasma in the plasmon-enhanced
   near-field and induce extreme thermodynamic states. The proposed method
   utilizes laser pulses, which in contrast to micro-and nano-mechanical
   actuators offers simplicity and versatility. We present time-resolved
   shadowgraphic imaging, electron microscopy and simulation data that
   suggest that our platform can efficiently create cavitation nano-bubbles
   and generate intense pressure in specific patterns, which can be
   controlled by the selective excitation of plasmon modes of distinct
   polarizations. This novel platform should enable probing non-invasively
   the mechanical response of cells and single-molecules at time and
   pressure regimes that are currently difficult to reach with other
   methods.}},

Journal = {{EPILEPSY \& BEHAVIOR CASE REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {{19-22}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: In a previous study, we investigated a 42-year-old male patient
   with primary reading epilepsy using continuous
   video-electroencephalography (EEG). Reading tasks induced left
   parasagittal spikes with a higher spike frequency when the phonological
   reading pathway was recruited compared to the lexical one. Here, we seek
   to localize the epileptogenic focus in the same patient as a function of
   reading pathway using multimodal neuroimaging.
   Methods and results: The participant read irregular words and nonwords
   presented in a block-design paradigm during magnetoencephalography(MEG),
   functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings, all combined with EEG. Spike
   analyses from MEG, fNIRS, and fMRI-EEGs data revealed an epileptic focus
   in the left precentral gyrus, and spike localization did not differ in
   lexical and phonological reading.
   Conclusion: This study is the first to investigate ictogenesis in
   reading epilepsy during both lexical and phonological reading while
   using three different multimodal neuroimaging techniques. The
   somatosensory and motor control functions of the left precentral gyrus
   that are congruently involved in lexical as well as phonological reading
   can explain the identical spike localization in both reading pathways.
   The concurrence between our findings in this study and those from ur
   previous one supports the role of the left precentral gyrus in
   phonological output computation as well as seizure activity in a case of
   reading epilepsy. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. This

Abstract = {{The recent development of a numerical strategy dedicated to the
   simulation of rotor/stator interactions stemming from structural
   contacts in modern aircraft engines led to the first optimization of a
   high-pressure compressor blade profile accounting for criteria related
   to non-linear contact simulations. This optimization procedure revealed
   very significant improvements in terms of amplitudes of vibration but
   failed to identify key design parameters. Satisfying numerical results
   were obtained by a minor modification of a combination of many design
   parameters. Based on this observation, this contribution intends to shed
   a new light on this previous redesign operation focusing on one key
   quantity: the clearance consumption. This quantity is presented in the
   first section. In the second section, results of the redesign operation
   are recalled before the presentation of original results, featuring
   detailed interaction maps in the frequency domain, on which focuses the
   third section of the article. Finally, the blade profiles are
   extensively compared based on their specific clearance consumption and
   presented results suggest that this quantity may be key in
   discriminating acceptable from unacceptable blade profiles with respect
   to their vibratory behaviour when structural contacts}},

Abstract = {{The development of a predictive numerical strategy for the simulation of
   rotor/stator interactions is a concern for several aircraft engine
   manufacturers. As a matter of fact, modern designs of aircraft engines
   feature reduced operating clearances between rotating and static
   components which yields more frequent structural contacts. Subsequent
   interaction phenomena (be it rubbing events, modal interaction or whirl
   motions) are not yet fully understood. For that reason, experimental
   data obtained from set-ups dedicated to the simulation of such
   interactions are scrutinized and are key in: (1) increasing the
   knowledge of the interaction phenomena and (2) allowing for a
   calibration of the numerical models with realistic events. In this
   contribution, the focus is made on an experimental set-up in Snecma
   facilities. It features a full-scale high-pressure compressor stage and
   aims at simulating contact induced interactions between one of the
   blades (slightly longer than the other ones) and the surrounding
   abradable coating that is deposited along the casing circumference. For
   this experimental set-up, it is found that the witnessed interaction
   involves a single blade thus it should be analyzed as a sequence of
   rubbing events and more specifically its first torsional mode, which is
   its second free-vibration mode. The focus is made both on the
   presentation of the experimental set-up and on the confrontation with
   the numerical results. Numerical results are analyzed by means of
   adaptative signal processing techniques and the consistency between
   numerical results and experimental observations is underlined both in
   time and frequency domains. In particular, the numerical strategy
   developed for Snecma is shown to predict very accurately the nature of
   the interaction as wear patterns obtained experimentally and numerically
   are a match. This numerical/experimental confrontation is the first
   attempt to calibrate a sophisticated numerical strategy with
   experimental data acquired within the high-pressure compressor of an
   aircraft engine for the simulation of rotor/stator interactions.
   Contrary to previous studies carried out within the low-pressure
   compressor of an aircraft engine, this interaction is found to be
   non-divergent: high amplitudes of vibration are experimentally observed
   and numerically predicted over a very short period of time. The ability
   of the numerical strategy to predict torsion induced interactions opens
   avenues for further analyses in turbine stages and with more
   sophisticated models including mistuned bladed disks and multi-stage
   components.}},

Abstract = {{The properties of dual mode resonance in planar SIW-based rectangular

   3-cavity pseudo-elliptic SIW filter based on H-203 \& H-104 hybrid
   resonance is designed and fabricated on a Rogers TMM3 substrate.
   Measured results show that the insertion loss at the central frequency
   around 24 GHz is 4.58 dB and the return loss is better than 20 dB in the
   whole pass-band of 760 MHz. The design method can widely be used for

Abstract = {{This paper presents a prognostic methodology that can be implemented in
   a condition-based maintenance (CBM) program. The methodology estimates
   the remaining useful life (RUL) of a system by using a pattern-based
   machine learning and knowledge discovery approach called Logical
   Analysis of Data (LAD). The LAD approach is based on the exploration of
   the monitored system's database, and the extraction of useful
   information which describe the physics that characterize its
   degradation. The diagnostic information, which is updated each time the
   new data is gathered, is combined with a non-parametric reliability
   estimation method, in order to predict the RUL of a monitored system
   working under different operating conditions. In this paper, the
   developed methodology is compared to a known CBM prognostic technique;
   the Cox proportional hazards model (PHM). The methodology has been
   tested and validated based on the Friedman statistical test. The results

Abstract = {{The use of machine tools for on-machine coordinate measurement on the
   workpiece is becoming commonplace. However, numerous errors can
   adversely affect the measurement accuracy. For instance, the inter-axis
   parameters are major contributors to the overall machine tool's
   inaccuracy hence estimation and compensation of such errors are
   prerequisite to fully exploit the machine's measurement capability. This
   paper presents a scheme to assess the accuracy of coordinate measurement
   by probing a precision sphere mounted on the machine table for different
   rotary axes indexations. Only the sphericity of the reference sphere is
   assumed and neither its size nor position. All individual probing data
   from all indexations are used for the assessment of the apparent out of
   sphericity of the reference sphere. Machine readings are processed
   either directly, using the machine nominal model, or using a compensated
   model. This provides a fast method to validate on-machine measurement
   before and after compensation with the exception of isotropic scale

Abstract = {{This letter presents the design and demonstration of a single-port
   dual-band linear patch antenna array operating at frequencies that are
   multiples of the fundamental frequency (12 and 24 GHz, for example in
   this demonstration) for harmonic sensing applications. The proposed
   antenna consists of a low-band serial feed patch antenna array and two
   high-band patch antenna arrays that couple to the feeding circuit over
   the high frequency band. In the low frequency band, the feeding circuit
   does not couple with the high band arrays. Simulated and measured
   results are presented to validate the proposed technique. The low-pass
   characteristics are demonstrated numerically. The measured reflection
   coefficients are lower than -18 dB at the operating frequencies and the
   measured gains are higher than 13 dBi.}},

Abstract = {{Given a probabilistic transition system (PTS) A partially observed by an
   attacker, and an omega-regular predicate phi over the traces of A,
   measuring the disclosure of the secret phi in A means computing the
   probability that an attacker who observes a run of A can ascertain that
   its trace belongs to phi. We consider specifications given as Interval
   Markov Chains (IMCs), which are underspecified Markov chains where
   probabilities on edges are only required to belong to intervals.
   Scheduling an IMC S produces a concrete implementation as a PTS and we
   define the worst case disclosure of secret phi in S as the maximal
   disclosure of phi over all PTSs thus produced. We compute this value for
   a subclass of IMCs and we prove that simulation between specifications
   can only improve the opacity of implementations.}},

Abstract = {{There exists a large body of work on the specification and detection of
   anti-patterns in the source code of software systems. However, there are
   very few studies on the origins of the occurrences of anti-patterns in
   the source code: do the very design of the systems lead to the
   occurrences of anti-patterns or are anti-patterns introduced during
   implementation? Knowing when anti-patterns are introduced could help
   software designers and developers improve the quality of the source
   code, for example by eliminating fault-prone anti-patterns early during
   the design of the systems, even before their implementation. Therefore,
   we detect occurrences of anti-patterns in design models and in the
   source code of some systems, trace these occurrences between design and
   implementation, and study their relation and impact on the source code.
   First, we analyze both the UML design models and the source code of 10
   open-source systems and show that antipatterns exist in design models.
   We observe that, on average, 37\% of the classes in the design models
   that belong to anti-patterns also exist in the source code and also play
   roles in the same anti-patterns. Second, we investigate two open-source
   systems to assess the impact of the anti-patterns in their design models
   on the source code in terms of changes and faults. We show that classes
   that have anti-patterns in the design models have more changes and
   faults in the source code. Our results suggest that the design of the
   systems lead to anti-patterns and that the antipatterns impact
   negatively the change-and fault-proneness of the classes in the source
   code. Thus, designers should be wary of anti-patterns in their design
   models and could benefit from tools that detect and trace these
   anti-patterns into the source code.}},

Abstract = {{Electromagnetic transients (EMTs) are fast and decay within a few
   cycles. Since EMTs are fast, the simulation step size required to
   simulate an EMT is small, which may make the simulation of a power
   system with an EMT-type software computationally demanding. This paper
   proposes a hybrid simulation method called Time Warping (TW) method
   which makes use of the fast decaying nature of EMTs to accelerate
   EMT-type simulations. The idea is that small simulation step sizes are
   only required in the first few cycles following an EMT event where fast
   transients exist; when these EMTs have decayed and a steady-state is
   achieved, it is possible to warp to the next EMT event skipping the
   steady-state in between. The paper shows the effectiveness of the
   proposed time warping (TW) method by applying it to a simple test
   circuit and a practical network. The simulation results show that the
   proposed TW method is capable of accelerating EMT simulations while
   providing the same accuracy as a full EMT-type tool.}},

Title = {{A Facile Approach for the Mass Production of Submicro/Micro Poly (Lactic
   Acid) Fibrous Mats and Their Cytotoxicity Test towards Neural Stem Cells}},
Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Despite many of the studies being conducted, the electrospinning of poly
   (lactic acid) (PLA), dissolved in its common solvents, is difficult to
   be continuously processed for mass production. This is due to the
   polymer solution droplet drying. Besides, the poor stretching capability
   of the polymer solution limits the production of small diameter fibers.
   To address these issues, we have examined the two following objectives:
   first, using an appropriate solvent system for the mass production of
   fibrousmats with fine tunable fiber diameters; second, nontoxicity of
   the mats towards Neural Stem Cell (NSC). To this aim,
   TFA(trifluoroacetic acid) was used as a cosolvent, in a mixture with
   DCM(dichloromethane), and the solution viscosity, surface tension,
   electrical conductivity, and the continuity of the electrospinning
   process were compared with the solutions prepared with common single
   solvents. The binary solvent facilitated PLA electrospinning, resulting
   in a long lasting, stable electrospinning condition, due to the low
   surface tension and high conductivity of the binary-solvent system. The
   fiber diameter was tailored from nano to micro by varying effective
   parameters and examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
   image-processing software. Laminin-coated electrospun mats supported NSC
   expansion and spreading, as examined using AlamarBlue assay and
   fluorescent microscopy, respectively.}},

   the requirement of a multiple time-scale separation between the system

   simple modification to the perturbation-based extremum seeking control

   approximated by a Wiener-Hammerstein model for which convergence rate
   acceleration schemes are available. The linear filtering used in the
   perturbation based extremum seeking control for estimating the objective
   function gradient is replaced by a recursive least square with
   forgetting factor estimation algorithm. It is shown that this simple
   modification can accelerate convergence to the optimum by removing one

   surfaces. The operating frequency is not sensitive to the profile of the
   antenna. A small profile can be achieved without the utilization of an
   artificial magnetic conductor or a substrate with high dielectric
   constant. To validate the proposed approach, full-wave numerical results
   are presented at 5.8 GHz showing good impedance matching, a high gain of
   about 22 dB, and an efficiency of 76\%.}},

Abstract = {{Fabrication, characterization, and applications of a fast rotary linear
   optical delay line (FRLODL) for THz time-domain spectroscopy are
   presented. The FRLODL features two reflective surfaces with spatially
   separated incoming and outgoing beams. It has been manufactured using
   CNC machining. A linear dependence of the optical delay on the rotation
   angle allows a straightforward extraction of the conversion factor
   between the acquisition time (in ms) and the terahertz pulse time (in
   ps). The FRLODL has been tested using rotation speeds of up to 48 Hz,
   corresponding to an acquisition rate of up to 192 Hz with four blades
   incorporated on the same disk. At high speeds we observe a decrease of
   the bandwidth due to the limitations of the electronics, in particular,
   the transimpedance amplifier. An error analysis is performed by
   experimentally evaluating the signal-to-noise ratio and the dynamic
   range. With regard to the applications of the FRLODL, we first present
   observation of the evaporation of liquids, namely water, acetone and
   methanol. We then demonstrate monitoring of the spray painting process.
   Finally, detection of fast moving objects at 1 m/s and their thickness
   characterization are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The use of exoskeletons as an aid for people with musculoskeletal
   disorder is the subject to an increasing interest in the research
   community. These devices are expected to meet the specific needs of
   users, such as children with cerebral palsy (CP) who are considered a
   significant population in pediatric rehabilitation. Although these
   exoskeletons should be designed to ease the movement of people with
   physical shortcoming, their design is generally based on data obtained
   from healthy adults, which leads to oversized components that are
   inadequate to the targeted users. Consequently, the objective of this
   study is to custom-size the lower limb exoskeleton actuators based on
   dynamic modeling of the human body for children with CP on the basis of
   hip, knee, and ankle joint kinematics and dynamics of human body during
   gait. For this purpose, a multibody modeling of the human body of 3
   typically developed children (TD) and 3 children with CP is used. The
   results show significant differences in gait patterns especially in knee
   and ankle with respectively 0.39 and -0.33 (Nm/kg) maximum torque
   differences between TD children and children with CP. This study
   provides the recommendations to support the design of actuators to
   normalize the movement of children with CP.}},

Journal = {{CATALYSIS SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{The acetone cyanohydrin process (ACH) to produce methyl methacrylate
   (MMA) relies on expensive and toxic feedstock and suffers from low
   yield. Methacrylic acid (MAA) esterification to MMA is an alternative to
   ACH. However, current processes to produce MAA require multiple steps
   and catalyst lifetimes are short. Here, we report an alternative
   chemistry based on 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol (2MPDO) which is a
   co-product of the hydroformylation of allyl alcohol to 1-4 butanediol.
   The cesium salt of a Keggin-type heteropoly acid (HPA) partially
   oxidized 2MPDO to MAA. Inserting vanadium into the HPA reduced the Mo6+
   to Mo5+, and promoting it with copper increases the selectivity to MAA
   but decreases the conversion by 11\%. The HPA catalyst operated in a
   gas-phase fluidized bed in which a 0.3 mm nozzle atomized the 2MPDO
   liquid feed into the bed at 250 degrees C. The maximum selectivity to
   MAA and methacrolein (MAC) was 41\% and 33\%, respectively, at 63\%
   conversion. In the first step, oxygen reacts with 2MPDO to form
   3-hydroxy-2-methylpropanal. This intermediate dehydrates to methacrolein
   (MAC) in the second step, and finally in the third step, oxygen reacts
   with MAC to form MAA. The main by-products were methane (gas phase) due
   to decomposition of the reactant and 2-methylpropanal (liquid phase)
   because of hydrogen transfer of MAC.}},

Abstract = {{The insula is a deep cortical structure sharing extensive synaptic
   connections with a variety of brain regions, including several frontal,
   temporal, and parietal structures. The identification of the insular
   connectivity network is obviously valuable for understanding a number of
   cognitive processes, but also for understanding epilepsy since insular
   seizures involve a number of remote brain regions. Ultimately, knowledge
   of the structure and causal relationships within the epileptic networks
   associated with insular cortex epilepsy can offer deeper insights into
   this relatively neglected type of epilepsy enabling the refining of the
   clinical approach in managing patients affected by it.
   In the present chapter, we first review the multimodal noninvasive tests
   performed during the presurgical evaluation of epileptic patients with
   drug refractory focal epilepsy, with particular emphasis on their value
   for the detection of insular cortex epilepsy.
   Second, we review the emerging multimodal investigation techniques in
   the field of epilepsy, that aim to (1) enhance the detection of insular
   cortex epilepsy and (2) unveil the architecture and causal relationships
   within epileptic networks. We summarize the results of these approaches
   with emphasis on the specific case of insular cortex epilepsy.}},

Abstract = {{HEK293 cells are gaining in interest for the production of recombinant
   proteins. However, further understanding and engineering of cell
   metabolism are still needed to improve protein titers. The importance of
   G6PDH has already been studied regarding redox balance, and a
   correlation has recently been established between the oxidative pentose
   phosphate pathway (PPP) and antibody peak production. In this work,
   HEK293 cells stably expressing interferon-alpha 2b, a parental clone,
   and a further engineered clone expressing the cytosolic yeast
   pyruvate-carboxylase (PYC) were transiently transfected to overexpress
   glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and increase fluxes through
   the PPP. The aim of the study was thus to evaluate the effect of
   overexpressing G6PDH on the ``pull{''} effect brought by the PYC
   phenotype. Results indicate that the cell metabolism is, however, highly
   robust, showing a highly regulated PPP damping the potential effects of
   overexpressing G6PDH. A metabolomic study also clearly demonstrates, by
   metabolites profiling, that the PYC clone has a highly robust and more
   efficient metabolic efficiency, compared to its parental clone.}},

Abstract = {{A stochastic integer programming (SIP) model is presented to optimise
   long-term scheduling of underground mine operations while considering
   geological uncertainty. To integrate this uncertainty, a set of
   stochastic simulations is generated, corresponding to representations of
   the deposit, and is used as primary inputs to optimisation. The
   two-stage SIP model developed considers a variable cut-off grade and
   accounts for maximum development, material handling flow conservation,
   mill and mine capacity, and activity precedencies for an underground
   nickel mine. The results show that the schedule generated has a higher
   expected value when considering and managing grade risk. They also
   demonstrate the benefits of risk control, which this approach allows.}},

Abstract = {{Designing mechatronic systems is known to be both a very complex and
   tedious process. This complexity is due to the high number of system
   components, their multi-physical aspects, the couplings between
   different engineering domains and the interacting and/or conflicting
   design objectives. Due to this inherent complexity and the dynamic
   coupling between subsystems of mechatronic systems, a systematic and
   multi-objective design approach is needed to replace the traditionally
   used sequential design methods. The traditional approaches usually lead
   to functional but non optimal designs solutions. In this paper, and
   based on an integrated and concurrent design approach called
   ``Design-for-Control{''} (DFC), a quadrotor UAV equipped with a stereo
   visual servoing system is used as a case study. After presenting the
   dynamics and the control model of the Quadrotor UAV and its visual
   servoing system, the design process has been performed in four
   iterations and as expected, the control performance of the system has
   been significantly improved after finishing the final design iteration.}},

Abstract = {{Natural resources industries, such as the forest product industry, must
   deal with variable input material, which affects their efficiency and
   their ability to accurately predict output yields. In order to address
   this, the industry can use technologies that adapt to variable input, or
   plan its operations taking variability into account. In the Canadian
   softwood lumber industry, the first approach is used with the adoption
   of advanced technologies that adapt sawing patterns to logs' and
   work-in-process characteristic using scanners technology. Another
   approach to deal with material variability is input material
   classification. Specific characteristics can be measured to classify
   input material and reduce variability within each class. However,
   whether the process involves logs, mining ores or recycled papers,
   material classification has both a value and a cost. This paper first
   proposes a method based on classification tree analysis to classify
   hardwood logs. Next, using agent-based simulation, it analyses the value
   of different classification strategies, from detailed, to no
   classification at all. Results show in the context of the Quebec
   hardwood lumber industry that the benefit of detailed classification is
   offset by its cost, while a relatively simple classification strategy
   dramatically improves output yield at relatively low cost.}},

Abstract = {{Hoeckens and Chebychev linkages have been widely discussed in the
   literature as design solutions to build single degree of freedom (DOF)
   leg mechanisms. Compared to fully actuated legs, often bio-inspired,
   they offer an unmatched simplicity. However; due to their limited motion
   capability, they can only be used when the traversed terrain is of
   limited difficulty. In order to alleviate this drawback, a novel design
   with a second DOF is proposed in this paper. The introduced mechanism is
   composed of a Hoeckens linkage augmented by a Pantograph for which the
   position of the pivot can be changed through an additional rotating
   link. Screw theory is used to determine the kinematic equations of the
   mechanism, its singular configurations, and its attainable workspace.
   Subsequently, an optimization of the geometric parameters is performed
   to maximize performance indices pertaining to the size of the
   mechanism's workspace. Finally, possible use of compliant joints is
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The quality of recycled material in a recycling process is actively
   influenced by an appropriate disassembly/dismantling strategy. In
   recycling the carcass of the aircraft, it is suitable to separate and
   classify different aluminum grades into their main alloys family before
   sending them to recycling center. However, due to complexity in the
   aircraft structure, fully disassembly/dismantling or fully shredding the
   aircraft is not economically or environmentally viable, respectively.
   For this reason, this work discusses eight different
   disassembly/dismantling strategies that have been done on a real
   Bombardier Regional Jet aircraft. The study proposes an approach to
   assess the sustainability influence of these strategies, as an important
   parameter that should be considered to select the most suitable
   strategy. This concept can be improved in order to be used in aerospace

Abstract = {{End-of-life (EoL) related directives have got a unique position in the
   design philosophy of almost every competitive product in the market.
   However, compared to the neighboring domains (i.e., automotive and

   present. In the present paper, a new systematic airframe disassembly is
   designed incorporating a set of destructivity-variable operations in
   order to disassemble a carcass to a defined depth. The improvements and
   the aptitudes are highlighted compared to the traditional methods.
   Meanwhile, the so-called ``disassembly alternatives{''} are presented
   and tested on a real jet airliner carcass (40-50 seats). An analysis of
   the feasibility with respect to the practicality degree is carried on.
   It is shown that the substantial profit is attainable; the dismantling
   becomes more organized and the associated performance of each airframe

Abstract = {{Product disassembly will only take place if there is enough generated
   profit. But as the end-of-life is often overlooked during the design
   process it makes the disassembly hard to perform and therefore the
   profitability is especially reduced. Design for disassembly is one of
   proposed solutions and fasteners are one of the points that have most
   impact on the disassembly of products. The aim of the proposed model is
   to determine among several alternatives which one allows to meet the
   requirements in assembly, in-use, services and disassembly. The model
   takes into account the semi-destructive disassembly (deteriorate a part
   of a sub-assembly to recover valuable components or materials and while
   reducing the disassembly time without important value loss). The model
   developed in this paper is mainly based on the Analytic Network Process
   (ANP) to define the best alternative and make the fastener selection
   during the design process easily. An example is presented for a better
   comprehension. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is

Abstract = {{Nursing workload in hospitals has an impact on the quality of care and
   on job satisfaction. Understandably there has been much recent research
   on improving the staffing and nurse-patient assignment decisions in
   increasingly realistic settings. On a version of the nurse-patient
   assignment problem given a fixed staffing of neonatal intensive care
   units, constraint programming (CP) was shown to perform better than
   competing optimization methods. In this paper we take advantage of
   recent improvements to the CP approach to solve the integrated problem

Abstract = {{Mammographic images are often characterized by a low contrast and a
   relatively high noise content, due to 3-D breast structures projection
   onto a 2-D image plane. These effects may hinder lesion detection.
   During the past decade, many techniques have been proposed to improve
   the mammography contrast. Nevertheless, some image regions might not be
   adequately enhanced, while others might be subjected to excessive
   enhancement. For that reason, we propose a method to denoise the images
   and enhance contrast uniformly. First, we used a machine learning method
   to create a sparse dictionary from the database, then we used the
   principal component analysis to reduce the size of the dictionary before
   decoding each patch of a given mammography. Finally, the algorithm was
   tested on MIAS and INbreast databases using the same parameters' values
   for each image. The results show that the visibility of breast mass and
   anatomic detail were considerably improved compared to the wavelet
   method and the computation time is halved compared to the conventional
   sparse coding algorithm and the curvelet method.}},

Abstract = {{Firm performance required numerous projects like total quality,

   innovation and KM (Knowledge Management). Models for measuring
   innovation and KM performance are new and concern mainly large
   companies. They have almost all been developed relying on input/output
   frameworks. The processes generating performance are not thoroughly
   taking in account. Drawing upon a literature review and a theoretical
   study, this paper contribution is based on an integrated conceptual
   model combining the value innovation chain of Hansen and Birkinshaw
   (2007) {[}1], and the SECI KM model of Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) {[}2],
   to build an integrated KM-innovation framework which can help to assess

   the bandgap guidance of a fiber, leading to spectral shifts in the fiber
   transmission spectrum. The sensitivity of the sensor to changes in the
   analyte refractive index filling in the fiber core is found to be
   1460nm/Refractive index unit (RIU). By using the spectral modality and
   effective medium theory, we determine the concentrations of commercial
   fluid from the measured refractive indices with an accuracy of similar
   to 0.42\%. The presented fiber sensor can be used for on-line monitoring
   of concentration of many industrial fluids and dilutions with sub-1\%v

Abstract = {{A simple and versatile methodology to tailor the surface of

   additional fluorescence capability to these contrast agents, is
   reported. The dual modality imaging protocol was developed by designing
   multi-functional scaffolds with a combination of orthogonal moieties for
   aqueous dispersion and stealth, to covalently link them to SPIONs, and
   carry out post-functionalization of nanoparticles. SPIONs stabilized
   with ligands incorporating surface-anchoring phosphonate groups,
   ethylene glycol backbone for aqueous dispersion, and free surface
   exposed OH moieties were coupled to near-infrared dye Cy5.5A. Our
   results demonstrate that design of multi-tasking ligands with desired
   combination and spatial distribution of functions provides an ideal
   platform to construct highly efficient dual imaging probes with balanced
   magnetic, optical and cell viability properties.}},

   combination of both methods enables three-dimensional acquisition of

Abstract = {{We present a linear all-fiber device exhibiting the functionality of a
   circulator, albeit for multimode fibers. We define a pseudo-circulator
   as a linear three-port component that transfers most of a multimode
   light signal from Port 1 to Port 2, and from Port 2 to Port 3. Unlike a
   traditional circulator which depends on a nonlinear phenomenon to
   achieve a non-reciprocal behavior, our device is a linear component that
   seemingly breaks the principle of reciprocity by exploiting the
   variations of etendue of the multimode fibers in the coupler.
   The pseudo-circulator is implemented as a 2x2 asymmetric multimode fiber
   coupler, fabricated using the fusion-tapering technique. The coupler is
   asymmetric in its transverse fused section. The two multimode fibers
   differ in area, thus favoring the transfer of light from the smaller to
   the bigger fiber. The desired difference of area is obtained by tapering
   one of the fiber before the fusion process.
   Using this technique, we have successfully fabricated a
   pseudo-circulator surpassing in efficiency a 50/50 beam-splitter. In all
   the visible and near-IR spectrum, the transmission ratio exceeds 77\%
   from Port 1 to Port 2, and 80\% from Port 2 to Port 3. The excess loss
   is less than 0.5 dB, regardless of the entry port.}},

Abstract = {{Pathological evaluation of the fallopian tubes is an important
   diagnostic result but tumors can be missed using routine approaches. As
   the majority of high-grade serous ovarian cancers are now believed to
   originate in the fallopian tubes, pathological examination should
   include in a thorough examination of the excised ovaries and fallopian
   tubes. We present an dedicated imaging system for diagnostic exploration
   of human fallopian tubes. This system is based on optical coherence
   tomography (OCT), a laser imaging modality giving access to sub
   epithelial tissue architecture. This system produces cross-sectional
   images up to 3 mm in depth, with a lateral resolution of approximate to
   15 mu m and an axial resolution of approximate to 12 mu m. An endoscopic
   single fiber probe was developed to fit in a human fallopian tube. This
   1.2 mm probe produces 3D volume data of the entire inner tube within a
   few minutes. To demonstrate the clinical potential of OCT for lesion
   identification, we studied 5 different ovarian lesions and healthy
   fallopian tubes. We imaged 52 paraffin-embedded human surgical specimens
   with a benchtop system and compared these images with histology slides.
   We also imaged and compared healthy oviducts from 3 animal models to
   find one resembling the human anatomy and to develop a functional ex
   vivo imaging procedure with the endoscopic probe. We also present an
   update on an ongoing clinical pilot study on women undergoing
   prophylactic or diagnostic surgery in which we image ex vivo fallopian
   tubes with the endoscopic probe.}},

Title = {{A numerical analysis of the stress distribution in backfilled stopes
   considering nonplanar interfaces between the backfill and rock walls}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{271-282}},
Abstract = {{Estimation of stresses in backfilled stopes is a critical issue for
   backfill design in underground mines. This task can be accomplished by
   numerical modeling. To date, most numerical modelings were performed
   without considering interface elements between the backfill and rock
   walls. The few published works using planar fill-wall interfaces showed
   that the stress states can be different than those obtained by numerical
   modeling without considering interface elements, especially when the
   shear strength of the planar interfaces is lower than that of the
   backfill. This tends to indicate that the stress estimation in
   backfilled stopes must be made by accounting for the (planar) fill-wall
   interfaces. In practice, blasting is commonly used in hard rock mines,
   and the stope walls are seldom regular and planar. Consequently, it is
   expected to be more appropriate to analyze the mechanical behavior of
   the backfill by considering nonplanar interfaces. In this paper, the
   stress distributions along the vertical central line of 2D backfilled
   stopes are analyzed using FLAC3D by considering nonplanar interface
   elements. The asperities of nonplanar interfaces are idealized by saw
   teeth and the roughness of interfaces is characterized by the teeth
   height and angle. The numerical results show that the stress state
   within backfilled stopes can be largely dependent on the shear strength
   and geometry of the interfaces. This indicates that a survey of the
   actual rock wall faces should be made and taken into account in the
   numerical modelings to obtain a better estimate of the stresses in the
   backfilled stopes. Nevertheless, the results further show that the
   numerical modelings using planar fill-wall contacts without interface
   elements lead to comparable stress distributions as those obtained by
   considering nonplanar interface elements when the interfaces are rough
   enough. More results are presented by considering different stope
   geometries and mechanical properties of the backfill with nonplanar
   interface elements.}},

Title = {{Ready-to-use and advanced methodologies to prioritise the
   regionalisation effort in LCA}},
Journal = {{MATERIAUX \& TECHNIQUES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{104}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{The spatial dimension is an important aspect in life cycle assessment
   (LCA). Indeed life cycle processes, and therefore also elementary flows,
   are most likely to be geographically scattered due to global supply
   chains. The environmental impacts related to an elementary flow can be
   different across the globe depending on the spatial variability of
   ecosystem sensitivity. Integrating spatial dimension seems to be a
   promising way to increase LCA results' reliability by reducing spatial
   uncertainties. LCA regionalisation refers to the integration of the
   spatial variability that really exists to improve result
   representativeness and reduce spatial uncertainties. As regionalisation
   requires additional effort for LCA practitioners, it is necessary to
   ensure the interest of such an effort and to prioritise it. This work
   proposes two methodologies to prioritise the regionalisation effort in
   LCA depending on the decision context and the type of study. They allow
   the selection of impacts, processes and regionalisation aspects that LCA
   practitioners need to focus on. The first one is a ready-to-use
   methodology and the second one involves more advanced tools based on
   spatial uncertainty analysis. The proposed methodologies are stepwise.
   The ready-to-use methodology involves tools that are already used by LCA
   practitioners and is based on impact contribution analysis. Regarding
   the advanced methodology, most relevant impact categories and processes
   to be further investigated for regionalisation are selected according to
   their impact contribution and their uncertainty level by using Monte
   Carlo simulation and regression analysis. The regionalisation effort is
   estimated depending on the confidence level required for the case study.
   The relevance and limits of each methodologies are investigated. Results
   underline the importance to take into account both impact and
   uncertainty contributions to select processes that need to be
   regionalised. The proposed methodologies highlight the need to focus on
   the goal and scope at the early stages of a study in order to clearly
   identify the intended audience and its requirements regarding study
   quality. A dialogue with the decision maker during the study would be
   beneficial. Those approaches can be relevant for other types of
   uncertainty but should be adapted.}},

Title = {{Gestures a Go Go: Authoring Synthetic Human-Like Stroke Gestures Using
   the Kinematic Theory of Rapid Movements}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Training a high-quality gesture recognizer requires providing a large
   number of examples to enable good performance on unseen, future data.
   However, recruiting participants, data collection, and labeling, etc.,
   necessary for achieving this goal are usually time consuming and
   expensive. Thus, it is important to investigate how to empower
   developers to quickly collect gesture samples for improving UI usage and
   user experience. In response to this need, we introduce Gestures a Go Go
   (G3), a web service plus an accompanying web application for
   bootstrapping stroke gesture samples based on the kinematic theory of
   rapid human movements. The user only has to provide a gesture example
   once, and G3 will create a model of that gesture. Then, by introducing
   local and global perturbations to the model parameters, G3 generates
   from tens to thousands of synthetic human-like samples. Through a
   comprehensive evaluation, we show that synthesized gestures perform
   equally similar to gestures generated by human users. Ultimately, this
   work informs our understanding of designing better user interfaces that
   are driven by gestures.}},

Title = {{A Second Life for TIIARA: From Bilingual to Multilingual!}},
Journal = {{KNOWLEDGE ORGANIZATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{22-34}},
Abstract = {{Multilingual controlled vocabularies are rare and often very limited in
   the choice of languages offered. TIIARA (Taxonomy for Image Indexing and
   RetrievAl) is a bilingual taxonomy developed for image indexing and
   retrieval. This controlled vocabulary offers indexers and image
   searchers innovative and coherent access points for ordinary images. The
   preliminary steps of the elaboration of the bilingual structure are
   presented. For its initial development, TIIARA included only two
   languages, French and English. As a logical follow-up, TIIARA was
   translated into eight languages-Arabic, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese,
   Mandarin Chinese, Italian, German, Hindi and Russian-in order to
   increase its international scope. This paper briefly describes the
   different stages of the development of the bilingual structure. The
   processes used in the translations are subsequently presented, as well
   as the main difficulties encountered by the translators. Adding more
   languages in TIIARA constitutes an added value for a controlled
   vocabulary meant to be used by image searchers, who are often limited by
   their lack of knowledge of multiple languages.}},

Title = {{A quantitative evaluation model to measure the disassembly difficulty;
   application of the semi-destructive methods in aviation End-of-Life}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Sustainable decommissioning of aircraft with a high content of metallic
   and non-metallic components is a current challenge in the industry. This
   process has historically appeared to be economically, environmentally
   and socially unviable. Literature indicates that, unlike entirely
   destructive and totally non-destructive techniques, semi-destructive
   disassembly may bring significant benefits. However, despite their use
   in a wide variety of applications, there are currently no feasible
   solutions on how to measure the associated physical difficulties and
   required efforts without any dependencies on expert views or filling out
   spreadsheet-like forms. In this paper, a new model is developed to
   accurately evaluate the disassembly easiness of an airframe
   quantitatively incorporating both product and process features. Based on
   a real disassembly of a passenger jet, the cutting and thrust force
   vectors are selected to evaluate and find the best operation sets. An
   airliner Horizontal Stabiliser is analysed as a case study. The results
   indicate that minor drilling, as a hybrid operation, can reduce the
   disassembly efforts significantly while offering an increased material
   recovery chance. Such quantitative evaluation can help to: proceed with
   a viable End-of-Life strategy; and implement newer approaches like
   automated disassembly by designing better disassembly robots, tool
   selection and process control.}},

Title = {{Automatic Screening and Grading of Age-Related Macular Degeneration from
   Texture Analysis of Fundus Images}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a disease which causes visual
   deficiency and irreversible blindness to the elderly. In this paper, an
   automatic classification method for AMD is proposed to perform robust
   and reproducible assessments in a telemedicine context. First, a study
   was carried out to highlight the most relevant features for AMD
   characterization based on texture, color, and visual context in fundus
   images. A support vector machine and a random forest were used to
   classify images according to the different AMD stages following the
   AREDS protocol and to evaluate the features' relevance. Experiments were
   conducted on a database of 279 fundus images coming from a telemedicine
   platform. The results demonstrate that local binary patterns in
   multiresolution are the most relevant for AMD classification, regardless
   of the classifier used. Depending on the classification task, our method
   achieves promising performances with areas under the ROC curve between
   0.739 and 0.874 for screening and between 0.469 and 0.685 for grading.
   Moreover, the proposed automatic AMD classification system is robust
   with respect to image quality.}},

Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{818-838}},
Abstract = {{A unified and reconfigurable multifunctional transceiver for future
   integrated data-fusion services of radar sensing and radio communication
   (RadCom) is studied and developed in this paper. This proposed
   alternative of the state-of-the-art architectures presents an
   unprecedented integration of all radar sensing and RadCom functions
   together in a time-division platform. Furthermore, it is capable of
   offering a positioning function of both moving and static objects with
   an enhanced resolution in ranging in addition to providing a greater
   capability of data communication. The design and the performance
   incompatibilities between radar and radio systems are explored and
   investigated. A systematic top bottom approach is presented, which
   involves the step-by-step methodology, building block design
   considerations, and the system level simulation. With the purpose of
   validating the proposed scheme, a low-frequency prototype around the
   FCC-commissioned dedicated short range communication (DSRC) band is
   developed, and its performance is evaluated. Since such a unified
   transceiver can find applications in intelligent transportation
   infrastructures, the system demonstrator is designed and examined
   according to the desired specifications of future automotive radar
   networks. Through various system level measurements, the proposed scheme
   has demonstrated attractive features in connection with both radar and
   radio functions. With the radar mode, the added ability of angle
   detection and the improved range resolution against the previously
   demonstrated version make the system suitable for driving assistance
   applications. With the radio mode, the system demonstrator has proved a
   great capability of communication at a data rate of 25 Mb/s.}},

Abstract = {{This letter presents and investigates a broadband sounding rocket

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROTATING MACHINERY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{With the rapid evolution of additive manufacturing, 3D printed parts are
   no longer limited to display purposes but can also be used in structural
   applications. The objective of this paper is to show that 3D prototyping
   can be used to produce low-cost rotating turbomachinery rigs capable of
   carrying out detailed flow measurements that can be used, among other
   things, for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code validation. A fully
   instrumented polymer two-stage axial-mixed flow compressor test rig was
   designed and fabricated with stereolithography (SLA) technology by a
   team of undergraduate students as part of a senior-year design course.
   Experiments were subsequently performed on this rig to obtain both the
   overall pressure rise characteristics of the compressor and the
   stagnation pressure distributions downstream of the blade rows for
   comparison with CFD simulations. In doing so, this work provides a
   first-of-a-kind assessment of the use of polymer additive technology for
   low-cost rotating turbomachinery experimentation with detailed
   measurements.}},

Title = {{Numerical simulations of seismic and post-seismic behavior of tailings}},
Journal = {{CANADIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{85-92}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Several tailings impoundments have failed as a result of earthquakes in
   the last few decades. A majority of these failures were due to direct
   seismic loading, tailings liquefaction during shaking, or the
   post-seismic behavior of the tailings as it relates to the dissipation
   of excess pore-water pressures that were generated during shaking.
   Previous work has indicated that the UBCSAND model developed by Byrne et
   al. in 1995 is capable of simulating the cyclic simple shear testing
   response of low-plasticity tailings over a range of consolidation
   stresses and cyclic shear ratios. However, the ability of the model to
   simulate the dynamic and subsequent behavior of such tailings for other
   conditions, such those induced by shaking table tests, has not yet been
   evaluated. In this regard, previous work has shown that the main
   components of the UBCSAND model cannot realistically simulate some
   specific responses, including the post-seismic volumetric strains
   related to excess pore-water pressure dissipation. This paper presents
   numerical modeling results of the dynamic behavior of tailings from hard
   rock mines. It introduces a method for simulating their post-seismic
   behavior by including an updating scheme for the elastic moduli into the
   UBCSAND model. The results of cyclic simple shear testing, seismic table
   testing, and complementary experimental relationships were used to
   calibrate and validate the model with its new component. The simulated
   response of tailings during cyclic simple shear testing and for a
   complete seismic table test shows that the proposed approach simulates
   the experimental observations well. Level-ground, seismically induced
   liquefaction and post-seismic behavior of a 15 m thick tailings deposit
   are also simulated, leading to post-liquefaction settlements that are in
   agreement with empirical relationships.}},

Journal = {{CARTILAGE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Objective The efficacy and safety of BST-CarGel, a chitosan-based
   medical device for cartilage repair, was compared with microfracture
   alone at 1 year during a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT)
   in the knee. The quality of repair tissue of osteochondral biopsies
   collected from a subset of patients was compared using blinded
   histological assessments.
   Methods The international RCT evaluated repair tissue quantity and
   quality by 3-dimensional quantitative magnetic resonance imaging as
   co-primary endpoints at 12 months. At an average of 13 months
   posttreatment, 21/41 BST-CarGel and 17/39 microfracture patients
   underwent elective second look arthroscopies as a tertiary endpoint,
   during which ICRS (International Cartilage Repair Society) macroscopic
   scoring was carried out, and osteochondral biopsies were collected.
   Stained histological sections were evaluated by blinded readers using
   ICRS I and II histological scoring systems. Collagen organization was
   evaluated using a polarized light microscopy score.
   Results BST-CarGel treatment resulted in significantly better ICRS
   macroscopic scores (P = 0.0002) compared with microfracture alone,
   indicating better filling, integration, and tissue appearance.
   Histologically, BST-CarGel resulted in a significant improvement of
   structural parametersSurface Architecture (P = 0.007) and
   Surface/Superficial Assessment (P = 0.042)as well as cellular
   parametersCell Viability (P = 0.006) and Cell Distribution (P = 0.032).
   No histological parameters were significantly better for the
   microfracture group. BST-CarGel treatment also resulted in a more
   organized repair tissue with collagen stratification more similar to
   native hyaline cartilage, as measured by polarized light microscopy
   scoring (P = 0.0003).
   Conclusion Multiple and independent analyses in this biopsy substudy
   demonstrated that BST-CarGel treatment results in improved structural
   and cellular characteristics of repair tissue at 1 year posttreatment
   compared with microfracture alone, supporting previously reported
   results by quantitative magnetic resonance imaging.}},

Title = {{Effect of heterogeneity and anisotropy related to the construction
   method on transfer processes in waste rock piles}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{184}},
Pages = {{35-49}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Waste rock piles producing acid mine drainage (AMD) are partially
   saturated systems involving multiphase (gas and liquid) flow and coupled
   transfer processes. Their internal structure and heterogeneous
   properties are inherited from their wide-ranging material grain sizes,
   their modes of deposition, and the underlying topography. This paper
   aims at assessing the effect of physical heterogeneity and anisotropy of
   waste rock piles on the physical processes involved in the generation of
   AMD. Generic waste rock pile conditions were represented with the
   numerical simulator TOUGH AMD based on those found at the Doyon mine
   waste rock pile (Canada). Models included four randomly distributed
   material types (coarse, intermediate, fine and very fine-grained). The
   term ``randomly{''} as used in this study means that the vertical
   profile and spatial distribution of materials in waste rock piles
   (internal structure) defy stratigraphy principles applicable to natural
   sediments (superposition and continuity). The materials have different
   permeability and capillary properties, covering the typical range of
   materials found in waste rock piles. Anisotropy with a larger horizontal
   than vertical permeability was used to represent the effect of pile
   construction by benches, while the construction by end-dumping was
   presumed to induce a higher vertical than horizontal permeability.
   Results show that infiltrated precipitation preferentially flows in
   fine-grained materials, which remain almost saturated, whereas gas flows
   preferentially through the most permeable coarse materials, which have
   higher volumetric gas saturation. Anisotropy, which depends on pile
   construction methods, often controls global gas flow paths. Construction
   by benches favours lateral air entry close to the pile slope, whereas
   end-dumping leads to air entry from the surface to the interior of the
   pile by secondary gas convection cells. These results can be useful to
   construct and rehabilitate waste rock piles to minimize AMD, while
   controlling gas flow and oxygen supply. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{A novel reactor reproducing PCB (pulverized coal boiler) environment was
   used to evaluate the potential of sorbent co-firing and waste
   co-combustion as cheap retrofitting techniques to reduce SO2 emissions
   of existing boiler. Several co-feeding tests of coal and CaCO3 and coal
   and Ca(OH)(2) have been performed for a gas residence time around 0.5 s
   (4 times shorter than PCB). Results show sulfur emission reduction up to
   18\% with Ca(OH)(2) injection, and up to 20\% with limestone for a Ca/S
   ratio of 2. Co-firing of a 20\% thermal share of a waste derived fuel
   called ReEF (TM), led to SO2 emissions reduction of around 20\%. Co
   firing of this ReEF (TM) led also to HCI emissions of more than 20 ppm
   due to the PVC content of the ReEF (TM).
   In order to describe the gas and particles evolution along the reactor
   height, a model combining almost 30 kinetic reactions from the
   literature and without any fitting parameters was developed. The model
   shows that the ReEF (TM) particles had higher residence time in the
   furnace than coal and sorbent particles. For the temperature and air
   injection pattern tested, the model accurately predicted the emissions
   measured at the exit of the reactor for all the feed compositions. (C)

Abstract = {{Thermoelectric behavior in semiconductor materials is investigated for
   the purpose of converting thermal energy to electrical energy. This
   paper measures and quantifies the variations in the internal electrical
   and thermal resistances of a thermoelectric module with respect to the
   circuit's electrical load in order to better characterize its behavior
   in a closed circuit. Since open-circuit measurements fail to accurately
   describe thermoelectric material properties in power generation mode,
   the load-bearing Seebeck coefficient and the load-bearing
   figure-of-merit are defined, measured, and discussed. It is shown that
   the load-bearing Seebeck and the load-bearing figure-of-merit are more
   accurate parameters in measuring a module's ability to operate in
   thermoelectric power generation mode. In particular, there exist peak
   load-bearing characteristics that are not identified using the
   conventional open-circuit definitions of the Seebeck coefficient and the
   figure-of-merit. The results show that the peak load-bearing
   figure-of-merit is compared with the peak power output showing a
   misalignment between the two quantities, the significance of which is

Title = {{Flow-induced vibrations of in-line cylinder arrangements at low Reynolds
   numbers}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{37-61}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The present study numerically explores the limiting two degrees of
   freedom (streamwise and transverse) free oscillation response of three
   circular cylinders, placed in an in-line configuration subjected to a
   uniform cross flow at low Reynolds numbers. Three identical cylinders
   with a low mass ratio (m{*} = 4/pi) and zero damping are considered. The
   spacing between the cylinders LID is equal to 4. The reduced velocity
   U-r is varied from 2 to 13 for two values of the Reynolds number (Re =
   100 and Re = 150). For comparison purposes, the free oscillation
   responses of an isolated cylinder and a tandem cylinder pair under the
   same conditions are also evaluated. The results show that the dynamic
   behaviors of three in-line cylinders are significantly different from
   those of the tandem cylinder pair. While the maximum transverse
   oscillation amplitude increases by about 25\%, there is now a very large
   streamwise oscillation amplitude (Ax/D approximate to 1.3), comparable
   to those in the transverse direction. They appear at U-r > 9. The
   frequency responses of the triple cylinder case are much richer; in
   particular, at higher U-r. There is a clear low frequency component
   which is most evident in the streamwise direction. Many of the
   displacement trajectories of the triple cylinder case can almost be
   described as ``bounded random movements{''}. The associated phase
   portraits and the Poincare maps show that the dynamical characteristics
   of the triple cylinder configuration are considerably richer than those
   of the tandem cylinder pair. Even at such low Re, the free oscillations
   of three in-line cylinders already seem to approach a chaotic response.
   In particular, there is evidence that the fluid structure system
   approaches to chaos via the quasi-periodic route. Due to such much more
   complex dynamical characteristics, it is therefore highly risky to
   predict the free oscillation behaviors of multiple cylinders by
   extrapolating those of the tandem cylinder pair. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In prior works, this group demonstrated the feasibility of valid
   adaptive sequential designs for crossover bioequivalence studies. In
   this paper, we extend the prior work to optimize adaptive sequential
   designs over a range of geometric mean test/reference ratios (GMRs) of
   70-143\% within each of two ranges of intra-subject coefficient of
   variation (10-30\% and 30-55\%). These designs also introduce a futility
   decision for stopping the study after the first stage if there is
   sufficiently low likelihood of meeting bioequivalence criteria if the
   second stage were completed, as well as an upper limit on total study
   size. The optimized designs exhibited substantially improved performance
   characteristics over our previous adaptive sequential designs. Even
   though the optimized designs avoided undue inflation of type I error and
   maintained power at 80\%, their average sample sizes were similar to or
   less than those of conventional single stage designs. Copyright (c) 2015

Abstract = {{Multipass welding is a common method for fabrication and repairs of
   large industrial steel parts. In the hydroelectric industry these parts
   are commonly made with 13Cr4Ni steels that present outstanding
   performances. In this research the microstructures and crystallographic
   textures of a multipass weld have been studied. The microstructure was
   found to be complex and heterogeneous, consisting of several regions
   affected by adjacent weld passes. The study showed that austenite parent
   grains modification happened in areas close to the subsequent weld
   passes. However, parallel and low angle interface laths were observed
   inside martensite sub-blocks over different regions. The hardness
   profile was explained by overlaying the simple three regions heat
   affected zone. In some regions a tempering heat treatment effect was
   observed while in some other regions a double-quenching has happened.

Abstract = {{This paper studies the robust optimization approach for the routing
   problem encountered in daily maintenance operations of a road network.
   The uncertainty of service time is considered. The robust optimization
   approach yields routes that minimize total cost while being less
   sensitive to substantial deviations of service times. A robust
   optimization model is developed and solved by the branch-and-cut method.
   In computational experiments, the behavior of the robust solutions and
   their performance are analyzed using Monte Carlo simulation. The robust
   optimization model is also compared with a classic chance-constrained
   programming model. The experimental analysis provides managerial
   insights for decision makers to determine an appropriate routing
   strategy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The DRAGON lattice code and DONJON full core simulation code are in
   active development since 1990. A lattice code is used to solve the
   neutron/photon transport equation using a deterministic approach over a
   domain corresponding to a subpart or over a complete 2D or 3D nuclear
   reactor. A full core simulation code includes steady state and transient
   neutron flux solution capabilities together with reactor operation,
   micro depletion, and simplified thermal-hydraulics models. The DRAGON
   and DONJON codes are designed around a scripting language, known as
   CLE-2000, to automate the flow of information used in computational
   schemes.
   DRAGON5 and DONJON5 are the latest version of these codes and features
   characteristics that are required to design advanced nuclear reactors.
   First, a new kernel, named GANLIB5, was implemented entirely in ANSI C
   to facilitate the coupling of the code in multi-physics environments and
   to permit the embedding in control systems. Second, we added new
   geometric capabilities to permit the representation of complex
   geometries that are typical of advanced applications. The first release
   of DRAGON5 and DONJONS was available in October 2013. Subsequent
   releases are permitting couplings with the geometry module (Geometry)
   and supervisor module (YACS) of the SALOME platform. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Growth factors (GFs) are potent signaling molecules that act in a
   coordinated manner in physiological processes such as tissue healing or

   potential of an oriented immobilization technique based on two high
   affinity peptides, namely the Ecoil and Kcoil, to allow for the
   simultaneous capture of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and the
   vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on a chondroitin sulfate
   coating. This glycosaminoglycan layer was selected as it promotes cell
   adhesion but reduces nonspecific adsorption of plasma proteins. We
   demonstrate here that both Ecoil-tagged GFs can be successfully
   immobilized on chondroitin sulfate surfaces that had been pre-decorated
   with the Kcoil peptide. As shown by direct ELISA, changing the
   incubation concentration of the various GFs enabled to control their
   grafted amount. Moreover, cell survival studies with endothelial and
   smooth muscle cells confirmed that our oriented tethering strategy
   preserved GF bioactivity. Of salient interest, co-immobilizing EGF and
   VEGF led to better cell survival compared to each GF captured alone,
   suggesting a synergistic effect of these GFs. Altogether, these results
   demonstrate the potential of coiled-coil oriented GF tethering for the
   co-immobilization of macromolecules; it thus open the way to the
   generation of biomaterials surfaces with fine-tuned biological
   properties.
   Statement of significance
   Growth factors are potent signaling molecules that act in a coordinated
   manner in physiological processes such as tissue healing or
   angiogenesis. Controlled coimmobilization of growth factors on

   This study demonstrates the potential of an oriented immobilization
   technique based on two high affinity peptides to allow for the
   simultaneous capture of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and vascular
   endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Our system allowed an efficient
   control on growth factor immobilization by adjusting the incubation
   concentrations of EGF and VEGF. Of salient interest, co-immobilizing of
   specific ratios of EGF and VEGF demonstrated a synergistic effect on
   cell survival compared to each GF captured alone. (C) 2015 Acta

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new method for solving the short-term unit
   commitment and loading problem for a specific hydropower system. Dynamic
   programming is used to compute maximum power output generated by a power
   plant. This information is then used as input of a two-phase

   nonlinear mixed-integer program in order to obtain the water discharge,
   reservoir volume and number of units working at each period in the
   planning horizon. The second stage solves a linear integer problem to
   determine which combination of turbines to use at each period. The goal
   is to maximize total energy produced over all periods of the planning
   horizon which consists of a week divided in hourly periods. Start-up of
   turbines are penalized. Numerical experiments are conducted on thirty
   different test cases for two Rio Tinto Alcan power plants with five

Abstract = {{During the preforming stage in Liquid Composite Molding (LCM), fibrous
   reinforcements are compacted to obtain the specified fiber volume
   fraction. Numerous studies have been carried out to understand their
   compression behaviors. The first objective of this investigation is to
   study experimentally the influence of the weaving parameters on the
   compaction behavior of five different 3D Interlock fabrics. In parallel,
   composite parts were fabricated to perform a microscopic analysis of
   fabric deformation after compression. The second objective is to provide
   a model of the experimental results. Since there is no nesting in
   three-dimensional woven fabrics, the compaction behavior turns out to be
   easier to predict than for laminates. A model based on experimental
   observations was devised to connect the compaction behavior with the
   deformation modes of five fabrics investigated. The good correlation
   with experiments confirms the assumptions on the main factors governing
   the compaction and relaxation of 3D Interlock fabrics. (c) 2015 Elsevier

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NON-LINEAR MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{90-104}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The present work targets shaft whirling motions induced by direct
   blade/casing unilateral contact occurrences in aircraft engine
   bladed-disk assemblies. These contact events are favored by increasingly
   reduced blade-tip clearances and potentially lead to harmful
   interactions that may threaten the engine structural integrity.
   A simplified 2D in-plane finite element model representative of the
   engine fan stage is built, accounting for the flexibility of the shaft
   through two linear springs attached to the disk center node and the
   structural coupling provided by the fan frame and the bearings; modeled
   by an array of linear springs. A linear stability analysis of the
   reduced-order coupled system reveals two unstable zones in a selected
   rotational speed range, emanating from the linearly predicted modal
   coincidence speeds.
   Through a time-marching strategy, two asymmetric contact initiation
   mechanisms are investigated: (1) a prescribed casing distortion and (2)
   a mass imbalance on the bladed-disk. It is shown how the 1-nodal
   diameter mode of the first modal family of the bladed-disk is dominant
   when a modal interaction arises from the transient casing distortion and
   leads to divergent regimes. The presence of the frame/bearings coupling
   induces a shift in the critical speeds detected, generally characterized
   by a backward traveling wave in the rotating frame and a forward
   traveling one in the fixed frame. Further, when a mass imbalance is the
   excitation source, the suspension modes appear to have a major role and
   a stable limit cycle is reached regardless of the coupling stiffness
   with much lower energy levels than in divergent regimes. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Background: The quality of tissue repairs depends on tissue integrity,
   surgical technique, and material properties of the sutures used.
   Currently, there is no clear consensus on which is the best suture to
   use during cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic
   intraperitoneal chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
   impact of heat and chemotherapy on sutures' biomechanical properties.
   Methods: Six different 3.0 absorbable sutures (Biosyn, Dexon II, Maxon,
   Monocryl, PDS II, and Vicryl Plus) were tested. All suture strands were
   incubated for a 24-h period in saline, mitomycin-c, and oxaliplatin at
   37 and 45 degrees C. Suture loops were then loaded to failure using a
   servohydraulic testing machine. Data for tensile breaking force (TBF)
   and elongation rate were collected for all samples.
   Results: Under basal condition, Maxon was the strongest of all sutures
   with a TBF of 59.6 +/- 4.3 N (P < 0.01), and no significant difference
   in TBF was observed between other sutures. Heat alone had no impact on
   sutures' biomechanical parameters. Exposition to mitomycin-c at 45
   degrees C did not significantly affect sutures' basal tensile
   properties, with Maxon remaining the strongest suture. When incubated in
   oxaliplatin at 45 degrees C, the six suture types had a similar TBF. In
   all experimental conditions, multifilament sutures had a significantly
   lower elongation rate than monofilament sutures, and no correlations
   were demonstrated between elongation rate and the TBF of sutures.
   Conclusions: This study showed that exposition to heated chemotherapy
   did not significantly affect absorbable sutures biomechanical
   properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   large force platform measurements has recently been developed to analyze
   ground reaction forces under each foot during the double support phase
   of gait. However, its accuracy for the measurement of the spatiotemporal
   gait parameters remains to be established.
   Objective: The aim of the present study was to establish the agreement
   between the spatiotemporal gait parameters obtained using (1) a walkway
   (composed of six large force platforms) and the newly developed
   algorithm, and (2) an optoelectronic motion capture system.
   Methods: Twenty healthy children and adolescents (age range: 6-17 years)
   and 19 healthy adults (age range: 19-51 years) participated in this
   study. They were asked to walk at their preferred speed and at a speed
   that was faster than the preferred one. Each participant performed three
   blocks of three trials in each of the two walking speed conditions.
   Results: The spatiotemporal gait parameters measured with the algorithm
   did not differ by more than 2.5\% from those obtained with the motion
   capture system. The limits of agreement represented between 3\% and 8\%
   of the average spatiotemporal gait parameters. Repeatability of the
   algorithm was slightly higher than that of the motion capture system as
   the coefficient of variations ranged from 2.5\% to 6\%, and from 1.5\%
   to 3.5\% for the algorithm and the motion capture system, respectively.
   Conclusion: The proposed algorithm provides valid and repeatable
   spatiotemporal gait parameter measurements and offers a promising tool
   for clinical gait analysis. Further studies are warranted to test the
   algorithm in people with impaired gait. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We provide a comprehensive delay and queueing analysis for two baseline
   medium access control protocols for multi-user cognitive radio networks
   with homogeneous users and channels and investigate the impact of
   different network parameters on the system performance. In addition to
   an accurate Markov chain, which follows the queue status of all users,
   several lower complexity queueing theory approximations are provided.
   Accuracy and performance of the proposed analytical approximations are
   verified with extensive simulations. It is observed that using an
   Aloha-type access to the control channel, a buffering MAC protocol,
   where in case of interruption the CR user waits for the primary user to
   vacate the channel before resuming the transmission, outperforms a
   switching MAC protocol, where the CR user vacates the channel in case of
   appearance of primary users and then compete again to gain access to a
   new channel. The reason is that the delay bottleneck for both protocols
   is the time required to successfully access the control channel, which
   occurs more frequently for the switching MAC protocol. It is thus shown
   that a clustering approach, where users are divided into clusters with a
   separate control channel per cluster, can significantly improve the
   performance by reducing the competitions over control channel.}},

   arrest condition. Conventional fatigue crack growth experiments are
   performed on C(T) samples using a wide range of R to validate the
   fretting approach. The results and analysis show that using a reverse

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider a specific variant of the field service
   routing problem. It consists in determining vehicle routes in a single
   period to serve two types of customers: mandatory and optional.
   Mandatory customers have to be served within a specified time window
   whereas optional customers may be served (or not) within the planning
   horizon. For more realism, we assume that service as well as travel
   times are stochastic and also that there are multiple depots. The
   objective is to visit as many optional customers as possible while
   minimizing the total travel time. To tackle this problem, we propose a
   2-stage solution method: the planning stage and the execution stage. We
   decompose the planning stage into two phases: the design of a skeleton
   of mandatory customers and the insertion of optional customers in this
   skeleton. In the execution stage, we proceed to a real-time modification
   of the planned routes to face stochastic travel and service times and to
   enable time windows to be respected. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this work, we study a supplier selection and routing problem where a
   fleet of homogeneous vehicles with a predefined capacity is available
   for procuring different products from different suppliers with the aim
   to satisfy demand at the minimum traveling and purchasing cost.
   Decisions are further complicated by the presence of pairwise
   incompatibility constraints among products, implying the impossibility
   of loading two incompatible products on the same vehicle. The problem is
   known as the Multi-Vehicle Traveling Purchaser Problem with Pairwise
   Incompatibility Constraints. We study the special case in which the
   demand for each product is unitary and propose a column generation
   approach based on a Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation of the problem, where
   each column represents a feasible vehicle route associated with a
   compatible purchasing plan. To solve the pricing problem we propose a
   hybrid strategy exploiting the advantages of two alternative exact
   methods, a labeling algorithm solving a Resource-Constrained Elementary
   Shortest Path Problem on an expanded graph, and a tailored
   branch-and-cut algorithm. Due to the integrality request on variables,
   we embed the column generation in a branch-and-bound framework and
   propose different branching rules. Extensive tests, carried out on a
   large set of instances, show that our branch-and-price method performs
   well, improving on average, both in quality and in computational time,
   solutions obtained by a state-of-art branch-and-cut approach applied to
   a three-index connectivity constraints based formulation. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Two different materials processing approaches were studied for an

Abstract = {{Emergency medical services (EMS) are dedicated to provide urgent medical
   care to any person requiring it and to ensure their transport to a
   hospital or care facility, if required. Moreover, in many contexts, EMS
   also have to provide transportation services for patients need to go
   from one hospital to another or between their home and the hospital. For
   such organisations, efficient strategies for managing the ambulance
   fleet at their disposal have to be selected, but the highly random and
   dynamic nature of the system under study makes this a challenging task.
   Most of the published studies which have considered these issues have
   done it focusing on a specific EMS context, one city or one territory
   for instance. However, it is possible to identify several common
   characteristics and processes from one EMS context to another. This is
   the purpose of the generic discrete event simulation-based analysis tool
   proposed here, which can be adapted to a wide range of EMS contexts. In
   particular, it explicitly considers the two types of tasks that can
   compose the mission of an EMS: serving emergency requests and providing
   transports between care units/hospitals/patients' homes.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic activated sludge modeling (ASM) and the concept of chemical
   oxygen demand fractionation utilized by this modeling approach suggested
   the existence of new strategies for minimization of excess sludge. One
   of these strategies consists of eliminating the traditional sludge
   wastage (WAS) and avoiding the buildup of inert solids in the aeration
   tanks by other means: fine screens are used to remove the inert
   particulate organic fraction (X-I), hydrocyclones (HC) are used for
   inorganic suspended solids (ISS), and different types of online
   digesters are used to further biodegrade the endogenous residues (X-P)
   via the return activated sludge (RAS) line. In this research, a model
   and a simulation program were developed that were able to mimic the
   apparent behavior of activated sludge variants with low solids
   production (LSP-AS). The model is an extended ASM1 assuming a small
   first-order biodegradation constant for X-P (k(Xp) = 0.007 d(-1))(-1)),
   and black boxes represent X-I and ISS removal. The simulations first
   depicted the way that different solid components build up in the
   aeration tanks when traditional activated sludge (C-AS) is operated at
   very high solids retention times (>100d, without sieves and HC).
   Secondly, the modeling showed that the C-AS process could hypothetically
   be replaced by LSP-AS variants with similar levels of active biomass and
   mixed liquor total suspended solids in the aeration tanks
   (2,500-3,500mgL(-1) TSS). For the studied case, at least 2 and 6\% of
   the RAS flow must be screened and digested, respectively, to avoid the
   accumulation of X-I, ISS, and X-P. Additionally, the size of the online
   digester will be approximately twice the volume of the aeration tank.
   The mathematical model implemented in Aquasim could serve as a
   didactical, operational, and research simulation tool for LSP activated
   sludge processes.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the complexity of the human spinal motion segments, the
   intervertebral joints are often simulated in the musculoskeletal trunk
   models as pivots thus allowing no translational degrees of freedom
   (DOFs). This work aims to investigate, for the first time, the effect of
   such widely used assumption on trunk muscle forces, spinal loads,
   kinematics, and stability during a number of static activities. To
   address this, the shear deformable beam elements used in our nonlinear
   finite element (OFE) musculoskeletal model of the trunk were either
   substantially stiffened in translational directions (SFE model) or
   replaced by hinge joints interconnected through rotational springs (HFE
   model). Results indicated that ignoring intervertebral translational
   DOFs had in general low to moderate impact on model predictions.
   Compared with the OFE model, the SFE and HFE models predicted generally
   larger L4-L5 and L5-S1 compression and shear loads, especially for tasks
   with greater trunk angles; differences reached similar to 15\% for the
   L4-L5 compression, similar to 36\% for the L4-L5 shear and similar to
   18\% for the L5-S1 shear loads. Such differences increased, as location
   of the hinge joints in the HFE model moved from the mid-disc height to
   either the lower or upper endplates. Stability analyses of these models
   for some select activities revealed small changes in predicted margin of
   stability. Model studies dealing exclusively with the estimation of
   spinal loads and/or stability may, hence with small loss of accuracy,
   neglect intervertebral translational DOFs at smaller trunk flexion
   angles for the sake of computational simplicity.}},

   Time-of-flight elastic recoil detection analysis (ToF-ERDA) documented
   pronounced Li+ trapping associated with the degradation of the EC
   properties and, importantly, that Li+ detrapping, caused by a weak
   constant current drawn through the film for some time, could recover the
   original EC performance. Thus, ToF-ERDA provided direct and unambiguous

Title = {{From Squid to Mammals with the HH Model through the Na-v Channels'
   Half-Activation-Voltage Parameter}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{The model family analyzed in this work stems from the classical
   Hodgkin-Huxley model (HHM). for a single-compartment (space-clamp) and
   continuous variation of the voltage-gated sodium channels (Na-v)
   half-activation-voltage parameter Delta V-1/2, which controls the window
   of sodium-influx currents. Unlike the baseline HHM, its parametric
   extension exhibits a richer multitude of dynamic regimes, such as
   multiple fixed points (FP's), bi- and multistability (coexistence of
   FP's and/or periodic orbits). Such diversity correlates with a number of
   functional properties of excitable neural tissue, such as the capacity
   or not to evoke an action potential (AP) from the resting state, by
   applying a minimal absolute rheobase current amplitude. The utility of
   the HHM rooted in the giant squid for the descriptions of the mammalian
   nervous system is of topical interest. We conclude that the model's
   fundamental principles are still valid (up to using appropriate
   parameter values) for warmer-blooded species, without a pressing need
   for a substantial revision of the mathematical formulation. We
   demonstrate clearly that the continuous variation of the Delta V-1/2
   parameter comes close to being equivalent with recent HHM
   `optimizations'. The neural dynamics phenomena described here are
   nontrivial. The model family analyzed in this work contains the
   classical HHM as a special case. The validity and applicability of the
   HHM to mammalian neurons can be achieved by picking the appropriate
   Delta V-1/2 parameter in a significantly broad range of values. For such
   large variations, in contrast to the classical HHM, the h and n gates'
   dynamics may be uncoupled - i.e. the n gates may no longer be considered
   in mere linear correspondence to the h gates. Delta V-1/2 variation
   leads to a multitude of dynamic regimes-e.g models with either 1 fixed
   point (FP) or with 3 FP's. These may also coexist with stable and/or
   unstable periodic orbits. Hence, depending on the initial conditions,
   the system may behave as either purely excitable or as an oscillator.
   Delta V-1/2 variation leads to significant changes in the metabolic
   efficiency of an action potential (AP). Lower Delta V-1/2 values yield a
   larger range of AP response frequencies, and hence provide for more
   flexible neural coding. Such lower values also contribute to faster AP
   conduction velocities along neural fibers of otherwise
   comparable-diameter. The 3 FP case brings about an absolute rheobase
   current. In comparison in the classical HHM the rheobase current is only
   relative - i.e. excitability is lost after a finite amount of elapsed
   stimulation time. Lower Delta V-1/2 values translate in lower threshold
   currents from the resting state.}},

Abstract = {{With the increasing use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in
   biomedical applications, robust yet simple methods for calibrating and
   benchmarking a system are needed. We present here a procedure based on a
   calibration object complemented with an algorithm that analyzes
   three-dimensional OCT datasets to retrieve key characteristics of an OCT
   system. The calibration object combines state-of-the-art tissue phantom
   material with a diamond-turned aluminum multisegment mirror. This method
   is capable of determining rapidly volumetric field-of-view, axial
   resolution, and image curvature. Moreover, as the phantom material
   mimics biological tissue, the system's signal and noise levels can be
   evaluated in conditions close to biological experiments. We believe this
   method could improve OCT quantitative data analysis and help OCT data
   comparison for longitudinal or multicenter studies. (C) The Authors.

Abstract = {{This paper presents an interactive planning system for forest road

   heuristic approach referred to as interactive large neighborhood search,
   within which the user contributes in a cooperative manner to the

   process is to exploit the problem-domain expertise of the user in order
   to, on the one hand, guide the search for a solution towards intuitively
   interesting parts of the solution space, and, on the other hand,
   generate more practical solutions that integrate aspects of the decision
   problem that are not captured by the heuristic objective function. This
   paper more specifically presents the user interface, the interaction
   mechanisms and the heuristic developed to support the cooperation
   between the computer and the user. We also present experimental results
   based on real problem instances, with an expert user. A comparison shows
   advantages for using the proposed interactive approach over a pure

Abstract = {{With the emergence of the new generation of avionics systems
   characterized by more complex architectures and much richer
   functionalities, traditional avionics networks can no longer supply
   comprehensive interactions between avionics sub- systems. The AFDX
   (Avionic Full Duplex Switched Ethernet) is recognized as one of the
   appropriate solutions allowing bridging this gap. As a real-time
   network, the AFDX is sensitive to data transmission delay. Hence,
   reliability assessment represents an important issue in the design of
   such networks. In this paper, the AFDX protocol with SP-FIFO scheduling
   policy is modeled based on the theory of network calculus. A worst case
   upper bound on deterministic delay is obtained. Moreover, the delay
   distribution is modeled and a probabilistic delay upper bound is
   computed using the stochastic network calculus. Experiments are carried
   out for both deterministic and probabilistic cases and the results
   conformed the validity of the approaches developed in the present work.}},

   shape and structuring of spokes}},
Journal = {{PLASMA SOURCES SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Non-homogeneous plasma distribution in the form of organized patterns
   called spokes was first observed in high power impulse magnetron
   sputtering (HiPIMS). In the present work we investigate the spoke
   phenomenon in non-pulsed low-current dc magnetron sputtering (DCMS).
   Using a high-speed camera the spokes were systematically studied with
   respect to discharge current, pressure, target material and magnetic
   field strength. Increase in the discharge current and/or gas pressure
   resulted in the sequential formation of two, then three and more spokes.
   The observed patterns were reproducible for the same discharge
   conditions. Spokes at low currents and pressures formed an elongated
   arrowhead-like shape and were commonly arranged in symmetrical patterns.
   Similar spoke patterns were observed for different target materials.
   When using a magnetron with a weaker magnetic field, spokes had an
   indistinct and diffuse shape, whereas in stronger magnetic fields spokes
   exhibited an arrowhead-like shape.
   The properties of spokes are discussed in relation to the azimuthally
   dependent electron-argon interactions. It is suggested that a single
   spoke is formed due to local gas breakdown and subsequent electron drift
   in the azimuthal direction. The spoke is self-sustained by electrons
   drifting in complex electric and magnetic fields that cause and govern
   azimuthally dependent processes: ionization, sputtering, and secondary
   electron emission. In this view plasma evolves from a single spoke into
   different patterns when discharge conditions are changed either by the
   discharge current, pressure or magnetic field strength. The azimuthal
   length of the spoke is associated with the electron-Ar collision
   frequency which increases with pressure and results in shortening of
   spoke until an additional spoke forms at a particular threshold
   pressure. It is proposed that the formation of additional spokes at
   higher pressures and discharge currents is, in part, related to the
   increased transport of charge towards the central part of the magnetron.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design of a meander-line circular polarizer
   optimized for oblique incidence and for a direction off from the
   principal planes (phi = 0 degrees, 90 degrees, 180 degrees, or 270
   degrees). This polarizing screen converts linearly polarized (LP) waves
   into circularly polarized (CP) waves and vice versa. To illustrate the
   design process, a three-layer meander-line circular polarizer is
   designed for an oblique incidence angle of (theta = 40 degrees, phi =
   45.) and its performance is examined in detail over the 18-20 GHz band.
   Measurements and simulations are in good agreement. Moreover, the
   sensitivity of the results to frequency and incidence angle variations
   is studied. The results show that the bandwidth of the meander-line
   circular polarizer is maximum when it is designed for normal incidence
   or for an oblique incidence in the two principal planes because coupling
   between orthogonal modes is weaker.}},

Journal = {{CONTROL ENGINEERING PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{45}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the problem of voltage control of islanded
   inverter-interfaced microgrids consisting of several distributed
   generation (DG) units with radial structure. The main objectives are to
   (i) design a decentralized/distributed voltage controller with minimum
   information exchange between DG units and their local controllers (ii)
   design a fixed-/low-order dynamic output feedback controller which
   ensures stability as well as desired performance of the microgrid system
   in spite of load parameter uncertainties. To this end, the problem is
   formulated as an optimization problem which is the minimization of the
   cardinality of a pattern matrix subject to an H-infinity performance
   constraint. Since the problem is intrinsically non-convex, a convex
   optimization-based design procedure for the controller synthesis is
   proposed in this paper. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is
   evaluated through simulation studies and Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL)
   verifications. The simulation and experimental results demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Trajectory and impact dynamics of bubbles in tap water were studied.
   Results confirm that bubbles with identical radii can be classified in
   two categories: fast bubbles and slow bubbles. Each category of bubble
   can describe zig-zag or helical motion. The aspect ratio and terminal
   velocity of a bubble depend on its radius and category. Restitution
   relations are also presented for the two categories of bubble after
   impact with an horizontal wall. With these relations, the state of a
   bubble after rebound can be predicted from its state before rebound. The
   aspect ratio before rebound of the bubble is found to play a key role in
   the dynamics of the impacts. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial ecology (IE) is a maturing scientific discipline. The field
   is becoming more data and computation intensive, which requires IE
   researchers to develop scientific software to tackle novel research
   questions. We review the current state of software programming and use
   in our field and find challenges regarding transparency,
   reproducibility, reusability, and ease of collaboration. Our response to
   that problem is fourfold: First, we propose how existing general
   principles for the development of good scientific software could be
   implemented in IE and related fields. Second, we argue that
   collaborating on open source software could make IE research more
   productive and increase its quality, and we present guidelines for the
   development and distribution of such software. Third, we call for
   stricter requirements regarding general access to the source code used
   to produce research results and scientific claims published in the IE
   literature. Fourth, we describe a set of open source modules for
   standard IE modeling tasks that represent our first attempt at turning
   our recommendations into practice. We introduce a Python toolbox for IE
   that includes the life cycle assessment (LCA) framework Brightway2, the
   ecospold2matrix module that parses unallocated data in ecospold format,
   the pySUT and pymrio modules for building and analyzing multiregion
   input-output models and supply and use tables, and the

   of open access software can, at the same time, increase quality,
   transparency, and reproducibility of IE research.}},

Title = {{Mechanical risk of rotator cuff repair failure during passive movements:
   A simulation-based study}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1181-1188}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Despite improvements in rotator cuff surgery techniques,
   re-tear rate remains above 20\% and increases with tear severity.
   Mechanical stresses to failure of repaired tendons have been reported.
   While optimal immobilization postures were proposed to minimize this
   stress, post-operative rehabilitation protocols have never been assessed
   with respect to these values. Purpose was to use musculoskeletal
   simulation to predict when the stress in repaired tendons exceeds safety
   limits during passive movements. Hence, guidelines could be provided
   towards safer post-operative exercises.
   Methods: Sixteen healthy participants volunteered in passive
   three-dimensional shoulder range-of-motion and passive rehabilitation
   exercises assessment. Stress in all rotator cuff tendons was predicted
   during each movement by means of a musculoskeletal model using
   simulations with different type and size of tears. Safety stress
   thresholds were defined based on repaired tendon loads to failure
   reported in the literature and used to discriminate safe from unsafe
   ranges-of-motion.
   Findings: Increased tear size and multiple tendons tear decreased safe
   range-of-motion. Mostly, glenohumeral elevations below 38, above 65, or
   performed with the arm held in internal rotation cause excessive
   stresses in most types and sizes of injury during abduction, scaption or
   flexion. Larger safe amplitudes of elevation are found in scapular plane
   for supraspinatus alone, supraspinatus plus infraspinatus, and
   supraspinatus plus subscapularis tears.
   Interpretation: This study reinforces that passive early rehabilitation
   exercises could contribute to re-tear due to excessive stresses.
   Recommendations arising from this study, for instance to keep the arm
   externally rotated during elevation in case of supraspinatus or
   supraspinatus plus infraspinatus tear, could help prevent re-tear. Crown

Abstract = {{We investigate the application of perfect magnetic conductor (PMC)
   packaging for a nonsmooth perfect electric conductor surface, caused by
   metalized via holes. The PMC shielding is artificially built by a metal
   lid of pins, based on the gap waveguide (GW) technology. As a
   foundation, the effects of via hole in a unit cell are studied first
   considering its diameter, substrate thickness, pin size, pin height, as
   well as relative position between the via hole and the pin. The via
   adjacent space and pin rows are also considered for a general grounded
   coplanar waveguide along with ground vias. The effectiveness of package
   for such a transmission line containing metalized via holes is then
   verified experimentally. It is shown that the measured performance
   agrees well with the simulation. This paper presents a guideline for the
   GW-based PMC packaging technology.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the concept and demonstration of harmonic diversity
   for wireless communication, which makes use of multiple harmonic radio
   frequency (RF) channels with respect to the carrier frequency. Rather
   than frequency and space diversities widely used today to improve
   multipath fading, signal quality and spectral efficiency, the proposed
   scheme does not require multiple RF transceiver front-ends. The
   advantages of inherent RF device nonlinear characteristics are harnessed
   to produce and process harmonics within single transceiver. Even though
   distinct harmonic channels will exhibit different order of phase shifts,
   the analysis shows that such phase offsets can be compensated by
   adjusting the phase of local oscillator (LO) at receiver end. Extending
   the framework of the Shannon theorem, an M-channel harmonic
   communication system is shown to reduce the minimum required
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the input of receiver by M-times. In
   addition, this work indicates that the power consumption of transmitter
   can be significantly reduced up to 66\% than the conventional ones.
   Through the analysis of channel capacity, the harmonic system is proved
   to outperform the single channel counterpart especially when SNR is low.
   To validate the correctness of the proposed concept, a series of
   experiments are carried out to emulate the developed theoretical models.
   For instance, a three-channel harmonic communication system is
   prototyped, involving certain RF harmonic components designed for
   demonstration. The retrieved signal strengths are examined with
   different phase setting of receiving LO, and various modulation
   techniques are applied for estimating the system performances. All
   measured results are in agreement with their simulated counterparts,
   thereby demonstrating the correctness and usefulness of the proposed
   theories and techniques for nonlinear communication systems of harmonic
   diversity.}},

Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Many thin-film optoelectronic devices use electrodes made of tin-doped
   indium oxide (ITO), which is acceptably conductive, as well as virtually
   transparent and colorless. Regrettably, indium is an uncommon element
   and its price continues to rise, so it is increasingly important to
   recover ITO electrodes from devices that are no longer needed. Previous
   work has shown that simple sonication in neutral water can separate
   intact ITO electrodes from other components in typical devices, in which
   the active components and ITO are separated by an ionic buffer layer of
   poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS).
   Sonication in water appears to be effective because it favors selective
   penetration and dissolution of PEDOT:PSS, thereby freeing the underlying
   ITO electrode. However, PEDOT:PSS is being replaced in emerging devices
   by the use of various metal oxides as hole-transport materials. We have
   now found that ITO electrodes in these new devices can be recycled by
   sonication in dilute aqueous base. The layers of ITO undergo only minor
   changes in composition and morphology, and the recovered electrodes can
   be reused many times to fabricate new devices without loss of
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Reference point-based methods are very useful techniques for solving
   multiobjective optimization problems. In these methods, the most
   commonly used achievement scalarizing functions are based on the
   Tchebychev distance (minmax approach), which generates every Pareto
   optimal solution in any multiobjective optimization problem, but does
   not allow compensation among the deviations to the reference values
   given that it minimizes the value of the highest deviation. At the same
   time, for any , compromise programming minimizes the distance to the
   ideal objective vector from the feasible objective region. Although the
   ideal objective vector can be replaced by a reference point, achievable
   reference points are not supported by this approach, and special care
   must be taken in the unachievable case. In this paper, for , we propose
   a new scheme based on the distance, in which different single-objective
   optimization problems are designed and solved depending on the
   achievability of the reference point. The formulation proposed allows
   different compensation degrees among the deviations to the reference
   values. It is proven that, in the achievable case, any optimal solution
   obtained is efficient, and, in the unachievable one, it is at least
   weakly efficient, although it is assured to be efficient if an
   augmentation term is added to the new formulation. Besides, we suggest
   an interactive algorithm where the new formulation is embedded. Finally,
   we show the empirical advantages of the new formulation by its
   application to both numerical problems and a real multiobjective
   optimization problem, for achievable and unachievable reference points.}},

Abstract = {{Harvesting low-density ambient microwave power as an alternative power
   source for small ubiquitous wireless nodes has been proposed in recent
   papers discussing emerging technologies like the Internet of Things and
   Smart Cities. However, a literature review of the state-of-the-art
   Schottky diode based microwave rectifiers shows that a maximum
   efficiency has been reached for such devices operating in the low-power
   regime, as is the case for ambient microwave power-harvesters. This work
   examines the underlying physical mechanisms responsible for this
   RF-to-dc power conversion efficiency limitation, and explores a high I-V
   curvature backward tunnel diode to overcome this efficiency limitation.
   Measurements of the 2.4 GHz RF-to-dc power conversion efficiency at -40
   dBm input power demonstrates that the backward tunnel diode outperforms
   the HSMS-285B Schottky diode by a factor of 10.5 and the Skyworks
   SMS7630 by a factor of 5.5 in a lossless matching network scenario. A
   prototype built using a new GSG probe embedded with a matching circuit
   showed a total power conversion efficiency of 3.8\% for -40 dBm input
   power and 18.2\% for -30 dBm input power at 2.35 GHz.}},

Abstract = {{Any significant increase in current levels of air traffic will need the
   support of efficient decision-aid tools. One of the tasks of air traffic
   management is to modify trajectories when necessary to maintain a
   sufficient separation between pairs of aircraft. Several algorithms have
   been developed to solve this problem, but the diversity in the
   underlying assumptions makes it difficult to compare their performance.
   In this paper, separation is maintained through changes of heading and
   velocity while minimizing a combination of fuel consumption and delay.
   For realistic trajectories, the speed is continuous with respect to
   time, the acceleration and turning rate are bounded, and the planned
   trajectories are recovered after the maneuvers. After describing the
   major modifications to existing models that are necessary to satisfy
   this definition of the problem, we compare three mixed-integer linear
   programs. The first model is based on a discretization of the airspace
   and the second relies on a discretization of the time horizon. The third
   model implements a time decomposition of the problem; it allows only one
   initial maneuver and is periodically solved with a receding horizon to
   build a complete trajectory. The computational tests are conducted on a
   benchmark of artificial instances specifically built to include complex
   situations. Our analysis of the results highlights the strengths and
   limits of each model. The time decomposition proves to be an excellent
   compromise.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Mechanical loadings influence bone growth and are used in pediatric
   treatments of musculoskeletal deformities. This in vivo study aimed at
   evaluating the effects of static and dynamic compression application and
   subsequent removal on bone growth, mineralization and neuropathic pain
   markers in growing rats. Forty-eight immature rats (28 days old) were
   assigned in two groups (2- and 4 weeks experiment duration) and four
   subgroups: control, sham, static, and dynamic. Controls had no surgery.
   A micro-loading device was implanted on the 6th and 8th caudal vertebrae
   of shams without loading, static loading at 0.2 MPa or dynamic loading
   at 02 MPa +/- 30\% and 0.1 Hz. In 2-week subgroups, compression was
   maintained for 15 days prior to euthanasia, while in 4-week subgroups,
   compression was removed for 10 additional days. Growth rates,
   histomorphometric parameters and mineralization intensity were
   quantified and compared. At 2 weeks, growth rates and growth plate
   heights of loaded groups (static/dynamic) were significantly lower than
   shams (p < 0.01). However, at 4 weeks, both growth rates and growth
   plate heights of loaded groups were similar to shams. At 4 weeks,
   alizarin red intensity was significantly higher in dynamics compared to
   shams (p < 0.05) and controls (p < 0.01). Both static and dynamic
   compressions enable growth resumption after loading removal, while
   preserving growth plate histomorphometric integrity. However,
   mineralization was enhanced after dynamic loading removal only. Dynamic
   loading showed promising results for fusionless treatment approaches for
   musculoskeletal deformities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Over the years, seismic activity has been a relatively common cause of
   tailings impoundment failure. The flow of liquefied tailings from such
   ruptures can result in very severe consequences, including loss of life
   and environmental damage. A co-disposal technique consisting of placing
   waste rock inclusions in tailings impoundments prior to and during
   tailings deposition was proposed by the authors. The waste rock is
   placed to create continuous inclusions within the impoundment, which
   provide a number of environmental and geotechnical benefits,
   particularly with respect to seismic stability. The results of numerical
   simulations previously performed have shown that the UBCSAND model can
   predict the seismic response of tailings. The UBCSAND constitutive model
   was used to conduct simulations to evaluate of the use of waste rock
   inclusions to improve the seismic stability of a tailings impoundment.
   The evaluation consists of numerical analyses of an actual tailings
   impoundment as constructed (without inclusions), and then assuming that
   it was constructed with inclusions, subjected to earthquake loads of
   various energy contents and with different predominant frequencies. The
   analyses were conducted in static, seismic, and post-shaking phases. The
   displacement of the surface of downstream slope of the tailings dyke was
   recorded during the analyses. The results indicate that the presence of
   waste rock inclusions can significantly improve the seismic behavior of
   the impoundment by reducing the displacements of the surface of the
   downstream slope and the extent of potential failure zones. Also, the
   results show that in most cases, the influence of a low-frequency
   earthquake on the displacement of the downstream slope of the tailings
   dyke is more important than that of a high-frequency earthquake. The
   performances of the tailings impoundment with different configurations
   of waste rock inclusions (varying width and center-to-center spacing)
   were classified based on the average normalized horizontal displacement
   of the downstream slope (ARx) for a range input ground motions. Charts
   were then developed to show how ARx is influenced by the total width of
   inclusions, their spacing, and the input ground motions.}},

   transformer is studied, and the results show that the new method is
   equivalent to the dual (inductive) model. However, it is concluded that
   the new method is more interesting than duality to couple large 3-D

   avoids difficulties of duality associated with nonplanar magnetic

Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Backfilling of underground stopes is commonly used in the mining
   industry. The stress state in these stopes has to be evaluated to ensure
   safe application of the backfill. In recent years, much work has been
   conducted to assess the stresses in single backfilled stopes. The stress
   distribution in stopes may also be affected by the excavation of
   multiple openings. This paper presents key results obtained from
   numerical simulations of two adjacent vertical stopes created in
   sequence. The results illustrate the influence of stope geometry (size
   and spacing), natural stress state, backfill properties, and excavation
   (and filling) sequence on the stress distribution in both stopes. The
   simulations indicate that the stress distribution in the first
   backfilled opening, following the creation of the second one, largely
   depends on the fill properties. These results also show the ways in
   which these factors may affect the stress magnitude and distribution
   pattern in the case of two adjacent stopes, when the creation of a
   second opening influences the response of the first one. It is also
   demonstrated that the second backfilled stope tends to behave in a
   manner similar to that of a single (isolated) stope, where a classical
   arching effect often dominates the stress distribution. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Candelilla bagasse fiber (CBF) was prepared by a mesh sieve and
   ball-milling process and its reinforcing effect in a polymer matrix
   analyzed. Composites of polypropylene (PP) and CBF were prepared by melt
   blending with varying amounts (20, 25, and 30 wt\%) of fiber using
   maleic anhydride PP as coupling agent. The chemical composition of CBF
   was analyzed according to Technological Association of the Pulp and
   Paper Industry (TAPPI) methods, and the morphology and thermal and
   chemical properties of CBF and its composites were analyzed by X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier-transform
   infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC),
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and tensile testing. In general,
   fibers extracted from candelilla by a reduction process are comparable
   in terms of micro- and nanostructure to other lignocellulosic fibers.
   Dynamic light scattering (DLS) results reveal that sieve-milling reduces
   the fiber size. The results also show that the thermal stability of PP
   was enhanced when using CBF, but the crystallinity index of the PP
   composites decreased slightly according to DSC and XRD results.
   Furthermore, the Young's modulus was increased in PP/CBF samples with
   and without MAPP to obtain improved wettability and fiber-polymer
   adhesion. We found that CBF is an excellent alternative to replace
   conventional materials or synthetic fibers, as well as for reinforcement
   in polymer composites.}},

Abstract = {{Waste rock inclusions can improve the seismic response of tailings
   impoundments, mainly through their reinforcing effect. Preliminary
   simulations of reinforced impoundments illustrated how such inclusions
   can be beneficial for impoundments subjected to earthquake loadings.
   This paper presents new results of numerical analyses of the seismic
   performance of a tailings impoundment with different configurations of
   waste rock inclusions (i.e. various widths and center-to-center
   spacings). The simulations were conducted using two base ground motion
   records, one characterized by high frequencies typical of the east coast
   of North America and the other characterized by low frequencies typical
   of the west coast. Both ground motions were scaled to obtain the same
   Arias intensity and peak horizontal ground acceleration. The seismic
   response of the tailings impoundment was evaluated using (1) the
   deformation of the downstream slope at the end of shaking, with respect
   to the energy content and predominant frequency of the applied ground
   motions, as well as the configuration of the inclusions, (2) the
   critically displaced volume of tailings at the end of shaking. A total
   of 108 dynamic numerical simulations were conducted and evaluated. The
   main results presented here show that waste rock inclusions can enhance
   significantly the seismic performance of a tailings impoundment when
   appropriate configurations are considered. These also indicate that the
   low frequency ground motions tend to produce larger deformations and
   greater critically displaced volumes of tailings in comparison with the
   high frequency ground motions. These simulations results provide
   preliminary guidelines to determine optimum configurations of waste rock
   inclusions for different seismic loadings.}},

Abstract = {{The study described in this paper investigated the effects of a
   mega-thrust subduction earthquake on the seismic performance of
   moderately ductile concentrically braced frame multi-storey office
   buildings (MD-CBF) located on Site Class C in Victoria, B.C., Canada.
   Using data from the 2011 M(w)9 Tohoku subduction earthquake in Japan and
   worldwide crustal earthquakes, nonlinear dynamic analyses were performed
   on detailed numerical models developed in the OpenSees framework. It was
   found that the effect of Trifunac duration on the nonlinear seismic
   response of 4-storey, 8-storey and 12-storey MD-CBF office buildings is
   particularly significant in terms of the strain accumulated in the
   fibers of hollow structural section braces causing low-cycle fatigue
   fracture. In addition, assessment of the likelihood of collapse safety
   of the studied multi-storey MD-CBF buildings found that the collapse
   margin ratio (CMR) value and the adjusted collapse margin ratio (ACMR)
   value are approximately 150\% greater under the crustal record set than
   under the subduction record set. Among the three buildings studied, only
   the 12-storey MD-CBF building subjected to the subduction record set
   failed to meet the collapse safety criterion of ACMR > ACMR(10\%).
   Consequently, the CMR value needs to be increased by strengthening the
   structural system. Therefore, particular attention should be given when
   designing MD-CBF multi-storey buildings located in the proximity of
   subduction fault, such as buildings in Victoria that lie within the
   Cascadia subduction zone. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the context of porous bone void filler for oral bone reconstruction,
   peptides that suppress microbial growth and promote osteoblast function
   could be used to enhance the performance of a porous bone void filler.
   We tested the hypothesis that P15-CSP, a novel fusion peptide containing
   collagen-mimetic osteogenic peptide P15, and competence-stimulating
   peptide (CSP), a cationic antimicrobial peptide, has emerging properties
   not shared by P15 or CSP alone. Peptide-coated surfaces were tested for
   antimicrobial activity toward Streptoccocus mutans, and their ability to
   promote human mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) attachment, spreading,
   metabolism, and osteogenesis. In the osteogenesis assay, peptides were
   coated on tissue culture plastic and on thin films generated by
   plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition to have hydrophilic or
   hydrophobic character (water contact angles 63 degrees, 42 degrees, and
   92 degrees, respectively). S. mutans planktonic growth was specifically
   inhibited by CSP, whereas biofilm formation was inhibited by P15-CSP.
   MSC adhesion and actin stress fiber formation was strongly enhanced by
   CSP, P15-CSP, and fibronectin coatings and modestly enhanced by P15
   versus uncoated surfaces. Metabolic assays revealed that CSP was
   slightly cytotoxic to MSCs. MSCs developed alkaline phosphatase activity
   on all surfaces, with or without peptide coatings, and consistently
   deposited the most biomineralized matrix on hydrophilic surfaces coated
   with P15-CSP. Hydrophobic thin films completely suppressed MSC
   biomineralization, consistent with previous findings of suppressed
   osteogenesis on hydrophobic bioplastics. Collective data in this study
   provide new evidence that P15-CSP has unique dual capacity to suppress
   biofilm formation, and to enhance osteogenic activity as a coating on
   hydrophilic surfaces. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater

   versatility of the simple synthesis procedure. In addition, the results
   also demonstrate that the modified decoupled approach to verify flow

Title = {{Influence of experimental conditions on measured thermal properties used
   to model phase change materials}},
Journal = {{BUILDING SIMULATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{637-650}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Modeling phase change materials (PCMs) thermal behavior requires solving
   a system of non-linear equations to account for temperature-dependent
   thermal capacity and thermal conductivity. These properties depend on
   the PCM temperature and state (solid, liquid or mushy). Most models rely
   on enthalpy-temperature or specific heat-temperature curves to consider
   the variable thermal capacity during heating and cooling processes.
   These curves are generally obtained through experimental methods such as
   a Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) test or the T-history method.
   Significant differences can be observed between the results of these
   methods, due to different experimental conditions. In order to clarify
   the influence of experimental conditions, experimentations on a
   bio-based PCM are performed with varying heat transfer rates and
   different configurations (PCM samples and PCM-equipped walls).
   Enthalpy-temperature or specific heat-temperature curves are computed
   for each case using an inverse method. A comparison between the results
   obtained with different methods and different heat transfer rates shows
   significant differences. The phase change temperature range obtained
   with the inverse method applied to the PCM samples is larger than the
   range obtained with the DSC test. The tests on the PCM-equipped walls
   show that varying heat transfer rates has a significant impact on the
   phase change temperature range and the hysteresis between heating and
   cooling curves. Higher rates increase the hysteresis and shift the phase
   change temperature range towards colder temperatures. Given the observed
   differences between properties obtained from different experimental
   conditions, it is recommended to carefully select the method used to
   define PCM enthalpy-temperature curves, taking into account the modeling
   application (PCM configuration and expected heating / cooling rates).}},

Abstract = {{Diverse applications of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles
   (SPIONs) in the chemical and biomedical industry depend on their surface
   properties. In this paper, we investigate the effect of initial surface
   charge (bare, positively and negatively charged SPIONs) on the resulting
   physicochemical properties of the particles following treatment through
   photo-initiated chemical vapour deposition (PICVD). Transmission
   electron microscopy shows a nanometric polymer coating on the SPIONs and
   contact angle measurements with water demonstrate that their surface
   became non-polar following functionalization using PICVD. FTIR and XPS
   data confirm the change in the chemical composition of the treated
   SPIONs. Indeed, XPS data reveal an initial charge-dependent increase in
   the surface oxygen content in the case of treated SPIONs. The O/C
   percentage ratios of the bare SPIONs increase from 1.7 to 1.9 after
   PICVD treatment, and decrease from 1.7 to 0.7 in the case of negatively
   charged SPIONs. The ratio remains unchanged for positively charged
   SPIONs (1.7). This indicates that bare and negatively charged SPIONs
   showed opposite preference for the oxygen or carbon attachment to their
   surface during their surface treatment. These results reveal that both
   the surface charge and stereochemical effects have determinant roles in
   the polymeric coating of SPIONs with PICVD. Our findings suggest that
   this technique is appropriate for the treatment of nanoparticles.}},

Title = {{A combined interactive procedure using preference-based evolutionary
   multiobjective optimization. Application to the efficiency improvement
   of the auxiliary services of power plants}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},

Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{While the auxiliary services required for the operation of power plants
   are not the main components of the plant, their energy consumption is
   often significant, and it can be reduced by implementing a series of
   improvement strategies. However, the cost of implementing these changes
   can be very high, and has to be evaluated. Indeed, a further economic
   analysis should be considered in order to maximize the profitability of
   the investment. In this paper, we propose a multiobjective optimization
   problem to determine the most suitable strategies to maximize the energy
   saving, to minimize the economic investment and to maximize the Internal
   Rate of Return of the investment. Solving this real-life multiobjective
   optimization problem with a decision maker presents several challenges
   and difficulties and we have developed a novel interactive procedure
   which combines three different approaches in order to make use of the
   main advantages of each method. The idea is to start with the
   approximation of the Pareto optimal set, in order to gain a global
   understanding of the trade-offs among the objectives, using evolutionary
   multiobjective optimization; next step is aiding the decision maker to
   explore the efficient set and to identify the subset of solutions which
   fits her/his preferences, for which interactive multiple criteria
   decision making methodologies are used; and finally we concentrate the
   search for new solutions into the most interesting part of the efficient
   set with the help of a preference-based evolutionary algorithm. This
   allows us to build a flexible scheme that is progressively adapted to
   the decision maker's reactions until (s)he finds the most preferred
   solution. The interactive combined procedure proposed is applied in
   practice for solving the problem of the auxiliary services with a real
   decision maker, extracting interesting insights about the efficiency
   improvement of the auxiliary services. With this practical application,
   we show the usefulness of the interactive procedure proposed, and we
   highlight the importance of an understandable feedback and an adaptive
   process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The final mean droplet size of concentrated solid-stabilized emulsions
   was predicted using a semiempirical approach. The first step was to
   estimate the coverage and interface generation potentials. The coverage
   potential was predicted from the properties of the particles while the
   interface generation potential was predicted from the correlation
   developed by Calabrese et al. (1986), which was modified to include the
   effect of coalescence since the effects of high oil and particle
   concentrations on the breakage and coalescence processes are not
   accounted for in this correlation. The second step was to compare the
   coverage and interface generation potentials and to deduce the
   theoretical stabilized interface by assuming that it is governed by the
   lowest potential. The last step was to determine the effectively covered
   interface from the theoretical stabilized interface by considering
   stabilization efficiencies. The stabilization efficiency was defined by
   analyzing the stabilization process at the droplet and the individual
   particle scales. At the droplet scale, assuming that emulsions are
   stabilized by covering the droplets with a network of particles,
   coverage efficiency was defined by comparing the coverage rate to the
   coalescence rate. At the particle scale, assuming that the droplet
   coverage results from the attachment of individual particles, three
   other efficiencies were defined from the particle attachment steps: The
   particle and the droplet first enter into contact during the collision
   step; the three-phase contact line is then formed and evolves until
   reaching the equilibrium position at which the attachment force should
   be strong enough to avoid detachment. This multistep approach generated
   size predictions that were in good agreement with the experimental
   measurements for a broad range of viscosities, at different impeller
   speeds, and particle concentrations. This led to highlight the impact of
   operating conditions on the emulsification process. We show that it is
   possible to link emulsification systems to different geometries by
   taking the mechanisms driving the emulsification process into
   consideration suggesting new avenues for scaling up emulsification
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{A complete critical evaluation of all available phase diagrath and
   thermodynamic data has been performed for all condensed phases of the
   CH3COOLi-CH3COOK-CH3COOCs system, and optimized model parameters have
   been found which best reproduce all available experimental data
   simultaneously. The CH3COOLi-CH3COOK-CH3COOCs system may be used in
   supported molten salt catalysis. The Modified Quasichemical Model for
   short-range ordering was used for the molten salt phase. No ternary
   model parameters were required for the liquid phase; the optimized
   binary parameters suffice to reproduce satisfactorily the available
   experimental data for the ternary system using a standard symmetric
   interpolation method. The calculated (predicted) minimum liquidus
   temperature corresponds to a ternary eutectic at T=368 K, with a liquid
   composition of (22.4 mol\% CH3COOLi+32.3mol\%CH3COOK+45.3mol\%CH3COOCs).
   This relatively low liquidus temperature makes the ternary mixture an
   interesting alternative to ionic liquids. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

   Prediction of the clay elastic properties}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Champlain Sea clay deposits play a crucial role in limiting contaminant
   migration to underlying aquifers in the Saint Lawrence River Valley.
   Champlain Sea clays are well known as being prone to landslide and
   sample disturbance. Estimation of their elastic properties using their
   in situ loading efficiency would provide mechanical properties for the
   soil dynamic analyses and immediate settlement calculations encountered
   in geotechnical projects. Determination of loading efficiency can be
   envisioned as a very small strain test. In this paper we describe a
   detailed monitoring program for 10 vibrating wire piezometers installed
   within sealed boreholes on 5 study sites near Montreal in Quebec,
   Canada. The pore pressure response to barometric pressure variation was
   analyzed with three methods: linear regression, visual inspection, and
   multiple regression, which gave loading efficiencies between 0.7 and
   0.95. These values were then used to estimate the elastic properties of
   the clay formation. Vertical compressibility and specific storage on the
   order of 1 x 10(-6) kPa(-1) and 1 x 10(-5) m(-1) were respectively
   obtained for most of the monitoring sites. A comparison of
   compressibility values derived from the in situ loading efficiency
   method, with those obtained with pressuremeter, oedometer, and pulse
   tests confirmed that clay compressibility is strain dependent. The pore
   pressures measured on the study sites have been corrected by applying
   the multiple regression and visual inspection methods. For most
   piezometers, both methods provided nearly identical results. However,
   for deep piezometers, the multiple regression method provided smoother
   pore pressure time series than the visual inspection method. The
   vertical hydraulic gradient obtained with corrected pressure data was
   shown to change significantly on some test sites during the monitoring
   period. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ruthenium nanoparticles (Ru NPs) function as effective catalysts in
   specific reactions, such as methanation and Fischer-Tropsch syntheses.
   It is our purpose to physicochemically characterize their surfaces, at
   which catalysis occurs, by surface-sensitive X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS), using the symmetric peak component anaylsis
   technique developed in our laboratory to reveal previously hidden
   components.
   Ru NPs were deposited by evaporation (0.25-1.5 nm nominal deposition
   range) onto highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). In addition to
   their surfaces being characterized by XPS, an indication of morphology
   was obtained from transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Our use of
   symmetric peak component XPS analysis has revealed detailed information
   on a previously unidentified surface oxide initially formed, as well as
   on the valence electronic structure and its variation with NP size,
   information that is of potential importance in the use of these NPs in
   catalysis.
   Each of the several Ru core XPS spectra characterized (3d, 3p and 3s)
   was found to be composed of three symmetric components. Together with
   two metal oxide O1s components, these give evidence of a rather complex,
   previously unidentified oxide that is initially formed. The Ru valence
   band (4d and 5s) spectra clearly demonstrate a loss of metallicity, a
   simultaneous increase of the Kubo gap, and an abrupt transfer in valence
   electron density from the 4d to the 5s orbitals (known as electron
   spill-over), as the NP size decreases below 0.5 nm. TEM
   photomicrographs, as a function of deposition rate, show that, at a rate
   that gives insufficient time for the NP condensation energy to
   dissipate, the initially well-separated NPs are capable of diffusing
   laterally and aggregating. This indicates weak NP bonding to the HOPG
   substrate. Carbide is formed, at both high and low deposition rates, at
   Ru deposition thicknesses greater than 0.25 nm, its formation explained
   by Ru NPs reacting with residual hydrocarbon vapor, under the influence
   of the heat of condensation released on Ru deposition, and not by Ru
   reacting with the HOPG substrate. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   diffusion contrast}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},

Volume = {{122}},
Pages = {{373-384}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{This project aims to characterize the impact of underlying noise
   distributions on diffusion-weighted imaging. The noise floor is a
   well-known problem for traditional magnitude-based diffusion-weighted
   MRI (dMRI) data, leading to biased diffusion model fits and inaccurate
   signal averaging. Here, we introduce a total-variation-based algorithm
   to eliminate shot-to-shot phase variations of complex-valued diffusion
   data with the intention to extract real-valued dMRI datasets. The
   obtained real-valued diffusion data are no longer superimposed by a
   noise floor but instead by a zero-mean Gaussian noise distribution,
   yielding dMRI data without signal bias. We acquired high-resolution dMRI
   data with strong diffusion weighting and, thus, low signal-to-noise
   ratio. Both the extracted real-valued and traditional magnitude data
   were compared regarding signal averaging, diffusion model fitting and
   accuracy in resolving crossing fibers. Our results clearly indicate that
   real-valued diffusion data enables idealized conditions for signal
   averaging. Furthermore, the proposed method enables unbiased use of
   widely employed linear least squares estimators for model fitting and
   demonstrates an increased sensitivity to detect secondary fiber
   directions with reduced angular error. The use of phase-corrected,
   real-valued data for dMRI will therefore help to clear the way for more
   detailed and accurate studies of white matter microstructure and
   structural connectivity on a fine scale. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{280}},
Pages = {{26-35}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The axial motion of HDPE, Acetal, and PTFE spheres immersed in a 3-D bed
   of the conventional fluidization materials was studied using the
   non-invasive radioactive particle tracking (RPT) technique. Coarse and
   fine sand as well as FCC were chosen as the fluidization material. The
   experiments were carried out at two excess gas velocities, i.e. U-e =
   0.25 m/s and U-e = 0.50 m/s.
   Rise of an object immersed in a bubbling fluidized bed can be descried
   by two characteristic velocities, i.e. rise and upward velocity. When
   circulation pattern is fully established, the mean upward and rise
   velocity to the mean bubble velocity ratios become comparable. It is
   shown that the object rise takes place principally in the drift of
   bubbles. The mean object rise velocity is primarily influenced by the
   excess gas velocity. Comparatively, the ratio between the physical
   properties of the fluidization medium and the object such as size and
   density has trivial impact on the rise velocity of the object. The mean
   object upward velocity can satisfactorily be predicted with a
   theoretical model with no adjustable parameter.
   The frequency of the object rise along the bed is independent of the
   object properties but influenced by the fluidization material. Comparing
   to coarse sand and FCC, the objects immersed in fine sand rise less
   frequently. This is attributed to the relatively longer residence time
   of the object in the emulsion phase of fine sand particles. The
   intermittent circulation of the medium and large size Acetal spheres in
   beds of FCC and fine sand is featured by the low upward and rise object
   velocities and the very limited height travelled by the object. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The frontier of the Production Possibility Set (PPS) consists of two
   types of full dimensional facets, efficient and weak facets.
   Identification of all facets of the PPS can be used in sensitivity and
   stability analysis, to find the closet target for inefficient
   Decision-Making Units (DMUs), and to determine the status of returns to
   scale of a DMU, among others. There has been a surge of articles on
   determining efficient facets in recent years. There are, however, many
   cases where knowledge of weak facets is required for a thorough
   analysis. This is the case, in particular, when the frontier of the PPS
   is constructed only of weak facets. The existing algorithms for finding
   weak facets either require knowledge of all extreme directions of the
   PPS or applicable only under some restrictions on the position of weak
   efficient DMUs. We provide a complete characterization of weak facets.
   Using this characterization, we then devise a different algorithm to
   find weak facets. We illustrate our algorithm using a numerical example.}},

Abstract = {{The environmental footprint of bioproducts depends on the performance
   and implementation strategy of the biorefinery processes through which
   they are produced. Life cycle assessment (LCA) studies are categorized
   into two general types: attributional and consequential. The
   consequential life cycle assessment (CLCA) method illustrates the change
   of flows to and from environment, resulting from different potential
   decisions. Depending on the analysis goal, CLCA is known to be the
   proper approach to address the environmental analysis of integrated
   biorefineries with multiple bioproducts.
   In this study, an LCA of hot water extraction-based biorefinery strategy
   was performed, including five production pathways. Defined process
   options consisted of an extraction of hemicellulose to produce (i)
   biogas, (ii) hemicellulose for animal feed, (iii) hemicellulose for
   C5-sugars, (iv) C5-sugars, and (v) furfural. Except for the
   ``biogas{''}, acetate salt was the by-product of all the process
   options. Consequential LCA results proved that the bark consumption,
   chemicals, and bioproducts transportation have significant environmental
   impacts. `Hemicellulose for C5-sugars' and `C5-sugars' outperformed
   other alternative options with a greenhouse gas reduction of 80\% and
   68\%, respectively. Also, normalized results of these two options
   presented remarkable improvement of more than three times in human
   health impacts in comparison to existing process at the case study mill.

Abstract = {{In this paper, several conformal leaky-wave antennas (CLWAs) are
   designed, which utilize backward radiating waves to focus the beam. They
   employ a metal strip grating (MSG) in order to introduce the required
   phase constant (beta) on a curved aperture to compensate for the
   defocusing due to the curvature. The required beta is obtained by
   modulating the distance between adjacent strips/slots to scan the beam
   toward broadside. Using backward waves with a modulated MSG on a
   smoothly curved CLWA is a novel design. Using a backward wave allows for
   a doubling of the aperture size as compared to the forward-wave case.
   This, in turn, leads to a doubling of the directivity. A simple
   two-dimensional (2-D) Fourier-series model is used to explain the
   radiation physics. Full-wave analyses using the FEKO and HFSS software
   packages are carried out to design and analyze these CLWAs in 2-D and
   three-dimensional (3-D), and to verify the concept. A CLWA with a
   focused backward wave, supported by a modulated MSG, is fabricated and
   tested. The calculations and experimental results confirm that directive
   beaming is possible with a backward wave on a curved, modulated MSG.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{39-49}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel structure-aware method for visual tracking.
   The proposed tracker relies on keypoint regions as salient and stable
   elements that encode the object structure efficiently. In addition to
   the object structural properties, the appearance model also includes
   global color features that we first use in a probabilistic approach to
   reduce the search space. The second step of our tracking procedure is
   based on keypoint matching to provide a preliminary prediction of the
   target state. Final prediction is then achieved by exploiting object
   structural constraints, where target keypoints vote for the corrected
   object location. Once the object location is obtained, we update the
   appearance model and structural properties, allowing tracking targets
   with changing appearance and non-rigid structures. Extensive experiments
   demonstrate that the proposed Structure-Aware Tracker (SAT) outperforms
   recent state-of-the-art trackers in challenging scenarios, especially
   when the target is partly occluded and in moderately crowded scenes. (C)

Title = {{Internal Drag Evaluation for a Through-Flow Nacelle Using a Far-Field
   Approach}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AIRCRAFT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1847-1857}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of this research is to propose a method for
   decomposing the total drag of a nacelle into external, internal, and
   wake drag. From a bookkeeping agreement, the internal drag (i.e., the
   drag generated inside a nacelle) is the engine manufacturer's
   responsibility and is not to be included in the aircraft's total drag.
   Consequently, computing the internal drag is mandatory for the airframe
   and engine constructors concerned and can be achieved either
   experimentally or by computational-fluid-dynamics analysis. Up to now,
   aerodynamic engineers have used a near-field approach to compute the
   internal drag using computational-fluid-dynamics analysis, but this
   method has serious drawbacks, including its dependency on the accurate
   location of the stagnation line. The new method proposed here has been
   applied to multiple two-and three-dimensional test cases, and results
   show that it is independent of the location of the stagnation line and
   yields accurate results that agree well with experimental and empirical
   data. Results also show that the wake drag of a through-flow nacelle is
   caused by the flow passing through the nacelle and so needs to be added
   to the internal drag.}},

Abstract = {{Designing scaffolds made from natural polymers may be highly attractive
   for tissue engineering strategies. We sought to produce and characterize
   chitosan-coated collagen membranes and to assess their efficacy in
   promoting chondrocyte adhesion, growth, and cytokine secretion. Porous
   collagen membranes were placed in chitosan solutions then crosslinked
   with glutaraldehyde vapor. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analyses
   showed elevated absorption at 1655 cm(-1) of the carbon-nitrogen (N=C)
   bonds formed by the reaction between the (NH2) of the chitosan and the
   (C=O) of the glutaraldehyde. A significant peak in the amide II region
   revealed a significant deacetylation of the chitosan. Scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) images of the chitosan-coated membranes exhibited
   surface variations, with pore size ranging from 20 to 50 m. X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed a decreased C-C groups and an
   increased C-N/C-O groups due to the reaction between the carbon from the
   collagen and the NH2 from the chitosan. Increased rigidity of these
   membranes was also observed when comparing the chitosan-coated and
   uncoated membranes at dried conditions. However, under wet conditions,
   the chitosan coated collagen membranes showed lower rigidity as compared
   to dried conditions. Of great interest, the glutaraldehyde-crosslinked
   chitosan-coated collagen membranes promoted chondrocyte adhesion,
   growth, and interleukin (IL)-6 secretion. Overall results confirm the
   feasibility of using designed chitosan-coated collagen membranes in
   future applications, such as cartilage repair.}},

   unimodal or multimodal grain size distribution curve (GSDC) were tested.
   We point out interesting differences between the approaches in physics,
   geotechnique, and hydrogeology, then discuss difficulties with testing
   methods, before analyzing all test data. We propose a method to fit a
   GSDC with either a single, or a sum of lognormal equations, which gives
   a closed-form expression for the specific surface. Then, we assess the
   performance of predictive methods for k(sat), including the
   Kozeny-Carman equation. A few methods, which use only a mean particle
   size, are shown to give excellent predictions for equal spheres and
   unimodal packings. Other methods, which use the effective size d(10) and
   the void ratio e, are also shown to give excellent predictions for
   packed spheres and non-plastic soils, in the ranges for which they were
   initially developed. A new equation is proposed, which successfully
   predicts k(sat) in the range from 1 to 10(-10) m/s, when the parameter
   {[}d(10)(2) e(3)/(1+e)] varies from 10(-9) to 10(2) mm(2), for spheres
   and non-plastic natural soils.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes models and algorithms for the pickup and delivery
   vehicle routing problem with time windows and last-in-first-out (LIFO)
   loading constraints (PDPTWL). The LIFO loading rule ensures that no
   handling is required prior to unloading an item from a vehicle: a linear
   stack loading structure is maintained and an item can only be delivered
   if it is the last one in the stack. Three exact branch-price-and-cut
   algorithms are proposed for this problem. The first incorporates the
   LIFO constraints in the master problem. The second one handles the LIFO
   constraints directly in the shortest path pricing problem. It applies a
   dynamic programming algorithm relying on an ad hoc dominance criterion.
   The third algorithm is a hybrid between the first two methods. Known
   valid inequalities are adapted to the PDPTWL and the impact of different
   path relaxations on the total computation time is investigated.
   Computational results obtained on instances derived from known instances
   of the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (PDPTW) are
   reported.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous strategies have been proposed to decorate biomaterials with
   growth factors (GFs) for tissue engineering applications; their
   practicability as clinical tools, however, remains uncertain. We
   previously presented two complementary amphipathic peptides, namely, E5
   and K5, which could be utilized as tags to direct GF capture onto
   organic materials -via E5/K5 coiled-coil interactions. We here
   investigated their potential as mediators of GF physical adsorption.
   Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays highlighted that both electrostatic
   and hydrophobic interactions could contribute to the adsorption process,
   without interfering with the peptides propensity for coiled-coil
   interactions. E5-tagged vascular endothelial growth factor, in
   particular, was efficiently adsorbed to poly(allylamine)-functionalized
   polystyrene, was maintained in a bioactive state and was steadily
   liberated over several days with little initial burst. This simple
   immobilization procedure was successfully applied to poly(ethylene
   terephthalate) films. Altogether, our data demonstrated that
   coil-tag-directed adsorption is a tunable, versatile and straightforward
   strategy to decorate biomaterials with GFs.}},

Journal = {{CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{981-987}},

Abstract = {{Background: Posterior spinal surgical correction is performed to correct
   spinal deformities in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Althoughthe
   relative spino-pelvic alignment changes after spinal surgery, pelvis
   remains unfused in idiopathic scoliosis surgery. The impact of the
   spinal fusion on the transferred load to the pelvis via sacrum is not
   documented in the scoliotic subgroups.
   Method: Bi-planar radiographs of 9 scoliotic subjects before and in
   average 16 months after spinal instrumentation surgery, and 12 controls
   were selected retrospectively. Patient-specific 3D reconstruction and
   finite element models of the spine, ribcage, and pelvis were developed.
   Spinal parameters (Cobb angles, kyphosis, lordosis), sacro-pelvic
   parameters (pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, sacral slope), frontal and
   sagittal balances, the position of the trunk center of mass, and the
   centroid of the stress distribution on the sacrum superior endplate were
   measured and computed before operation and in the last follow-up.
   Findings: The position of the stress distribution centroid on the sacrum
   superior endplate with respect to the central hip vertical axis was
   significantly different between pre-operative and post-operative
   patients p < 0.05. The distance between the anterior posterior position
   of the trunk center of mass and thecenter of pressure on the superior
   sacral endplate significantly decreased after the spinal surgery p <
   0.05.
   Interpretation: The impact of the scoliosis spinal fusion on the
   transferred load between the spine and pelvis was evaluated. The
   biomechanical loading of the sacrum endplate was related to the
   post-operative postural balance and compensatory changes in the
   spino-pelvic alignment after scoliosis surgery. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Numerical investigation of seismic behavior of short-core all-steel
   buckling restrained braces}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{114}},
Pages = {{89-99}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Conventional budding restrained braces used in concentrically braced
   frames are expected to yield in both tension and compression without
   significant degradation of capacity under severe seismic ground motions.
   On the other hand, a new short core budding restrained brace system
   could be introduced as an alternative for a conventional full core BRB.
   In a short core BRB (SCBRB), the core element is built shorter than
   usual. Therefore, for a given story drift, the core accepts bigger axial
   strains compared to a conventional (full core) BRB. A short core BRB
   seems to be easily fabricated, inspected, and replaced after a severe
   earthquake. The purpose of this study is to show how this type of
   buckling restrained braces is feasible. Reducing the core length in a
   buckling restrained brace may result in a shorter encasing member,
   decrease in frictional forces acting at the core and buckling
   restraining mechanism interface, and, as a consequence, reduction of the
   compression strength adjustment factor in the brace. This paper
   numerically investigates the seismic behavior of short core buckling
   restrained braced frames. The minimum core length of BRB is determined
   by considering the low cycle fatigue life of the core plate and the
   maximum anticipated strain demand under standard loading protocol.
   Nonlinear time history analyses were also performed on four and ten
   story prototype buildings equipped with full core (conventional BRBs)
   and short core BRBs and the story drifts were compared. The results
   showed that the SCBRB system is partially able to reduce the story and
   residual story drifts in the braced frames. In addition, SCBRBs sustain
   large plastic deformations without crossing the low cycle fatigue life
   borders or instability of the encasing system. However, the economic and
   practical aspects of using SCBRB seem to be more distinct in comparison
   to its mechanical characteristics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Evaluation of the OSC-TV iterative reconstruction algorithm for
   cone-beam optical CT}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{6376-6386}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The present work evaluates an iterative reconstruction
   approach, namely, the ordered subsets convex (OSC) algorithm with
   regularization via total variation (TV) minimization in the field of
   cone-beam optical computed tomography (optical CT). One of the uses of
   optical CT is gel-based 3D dosimetry for radiation therapy, where it is
   employed to map dose distributions in radiosensitive gels. Model-based
   iterative reconstruction may improve optical CT image quality and
   contribute to a wider use of optical CT in clinical gel dosimetry.
   Methods: This algorithm was evaluated using experimental data acquired
   by a cone-beam optical CT system, as well as complementary numerical
   simulations. A fast GPU implementation of OSC-TV was used to achieve
   reconstruction times comparable to those of conventional filtered
   backprojection. Images obtained via OSC-TV were compared with the
   corresponding filtered backprojections. Spatial resolution and
   uniformity phantoms were scanned and respective reconstructions were
   subject to evaluation of the modulation transfer function, image
   uniformity, and accuracy. The artifacts due to refraction and total
   signal loss from opaque objects were also studied.
   Results: The cone-beam optical CT data reconstructions showed that
   OSC-TV outperforms filtered backprojection in terms of image quality,
   thanks to a model-based simulation of the photon attenuation process. It
   was shown to significantly improve the image spatial resolution and
   reduce image noise. The accuracy of the estimation of linear attenuation
   coefficients remained similar to that obtained via filtered
   backprojection. Certain image artifacts due to opaque objects were
   reduced. Nevertheless, the common artifact due to the gel container
   walls could not be eliminated.
   Conclusions: The use of iterative reconstruction improves cone-beam
   optical CT image quality in many ways. The comparisons between OSC-TV
   and filtered backprojection presented in this paper demonstrate that
   OSC-TV can potentially improve the rendering of spatial features and
   reduce cone-beam optical CT artifacts. (C) 2015 American Association of

Abstract = {{Bending tests were conducted on specimens of unsaturated tailings from
   three hard rock mines to evaluate their tensile strength. Saturated
   samples were prepared at an initial water content, w(0), of 40\% and
   then naturally dried under ambient conditions to pre-selected degrees of
   saturation, S-r, which can be related to the corresponding suction using
   the water retention curve. The basic interpretation of the bending tests
   results is based on an elastic-brittle behavior. The results show how
   the tensile strength, sigma(t), of unsaturated tailings varies with
   water content, w (and S-r). The experimental data are also used to
   evaluate Young's modulus in tension, E-t, and to estimate the apparent
   cohesion, c(app), as a function of S-r. Predictive equations are also
   applied to estimate the values of sigma(t) of unsaturated tailings using
   the water retention curve.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We implement a selection process based on DRAGON and DONJON simulations
   to identify interesting thorium fuel cycles driven by low-enriched
   uranium or DUPIC dioxide fuels for CANDU-6 reactors. We also develop a
   fuel management optimization method based on the physics of discrete
   on-power refueling and the time-average approach to maximize the
   economical advantages of the candidates that have been pre-selected
   using a corrected infinite lattice model. Credible instantaneous states
   are also defined using a channel age model and simulated to quantify the
   hot spots amplitude and the departure from criticality with fixed
   reactivity devices.
   For the most promising fuels identified using coarse models, optimized
   2D cell and 3D reactivity device supercell DRAGON models are then used
   to generate accurate reactor databases at low computational cost. The
   application of the selection process to different cycles demonstrates
   the efficiency of our procedure in identifying the most interesting fuel
   compositions and refueling options for a CANDU reactor. The results show
   that using our optimization method one can obtain fuels that achieve a
   high average exit burnup while respecting the reference cycle safety

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to establish the optimality of a hedging-point

   system with a risk-averse criterion that is defined as the conditional
   value-at-risk (CVaR) of the steady-state instantaneous running cost,
   where the system is subject to a constant single-product demand rate. An
   explicit expression for the optimal control policy is also obtained for
   the two-state case. The results are important from both theoretical and
   practical viewpoints. Indeed, the paper extends the well-known classical
   theoretical result on the optimality of hedging-point control policies
   under risk-neutral criteria, which are typically given by long-run
   average costs, and it develops a flexible and practical method for
   incorporating risk aversion into cost criteria. The approach presented
   here can be used to specify optimal control policies in similar

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of compressive
   modulation parameters (mode, magnitude, duration, as well as frequency
   and amplitude for cyclic modulation) on the viability of growth plate
   chondrocytes. Swine ulnar growth plate explants (n=60) were randomly
   distributed among 10 groups: baseline (n=1x6); culture control (n=1x6);
   static (n=3x6); and dynamic (n=5x6). Static and dynamic samples were
   modulated in vitro using a bioreactor. Different compression magnitudes
   (0.1MPa or 0.2MPa), durations (12h or 24h), frequencies (0.1Hz or
   1.0Hz), and amplitudes (30\% or 100\%) were investigated. Viability was
   assessed by automatic quantification of number of live/dead cells from
   confocal images of Live/Dead labeled tissues. Chondrocyte viability was
   found to be dependent on compression magnitude, duration, frequency, and
   amplitude in a way that increasing each parameter decreased viability in
   certain zones of growth plate. More specifically, proliferative and
   hypertrophic chondrocytes were found to be more sensitive to the applied
   compression. This study provides an in vitro protocol for studying the
   effects of compressive modulation on biomechanical and biological
   responses of growth plate explants, which will be useful in finding
   efficient and non-detrimental parameters for mechanical modulation of
   bone growth exploited in scoliosis fusionless treatments. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{Bearing failure can lead to major damage to rotating components and its
   diagnosis and prognosis are therefore of paramount importance.
   Techniques and approaches for detecting bearing faults abound. However,
   application of these methods is limited for complex systems such as
   aircraft engines. This stems from the fact that the complex
   configuration of the system and inaccessibility make it difficult to
   place the vibration transducers close to the bearings. In most cases,
   available instrumentation is limited to few vibration transducers on the
   casing of the machine. In such cases, the vibration due to bearing
   faults is barely detectable using traditional methods, because it
   normally makes only a small contribution to the overall energy and this
   is to some extent dissipated by the transmission path. For bearing fault
   detection to be effective in such applications, the methodology must be
   capable of detecting faint bearing signals and also allow consistent
   trending and tracking. This study examines these requirements in detail
   and presents an experimental assessment of newly emerging cyclic
   spectral analysis in this field for such requirements.}},

Title = {{Lower bounds and exact algorithms for the quadratic minimum spanning
   tree problem}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& OPERATIONS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{149-160}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We address the quadratic minimum spanning tree problem (QMSTP), the
   problem of finding a spanning tree of a connected and undirected graph
   such that a quadratic cost function is minimized. We first propose an
   integer programming formulation based on the reformulation-linearization
   technique (RLT). We then use the idea of partitioning spanning trees
   into forests of a given fixed size and obtain a QMSTP reformulation that
   generalizes the RLT model. The reformulation is such that the larger the
   size of the forests, the stronger lower bounds provided. Thus, a
   hierarchy of formulations is obtained. At the lowest hierarchy level,
   one has precisely the RLT formulation, which is already stronger than
   previous formulations in the literature. The highest hierarchy level
   provides the convex hull of integer feasible solutions for the problem.
   The formulations introduced here are not compact, so the direct
   evaluation of their linear programming relaxation bounds is not
   practical. To overcome that, we introduce two lower bounding procedures
   based on Lagrangian relaxation. These procedures are embedded into two
   parallel branch-and-bound algorithms. As a result of our study, several
   instances in the literature were solved to optimality for the first
   time. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Surface plasmon resonance-based biosensors have been successfully
   applied to the study of the interactions between macromolecules and
   small molecular weight compounds. In an effort to increase the
   throughput of these SPR-based experiments, we have already proposed to
   inject multiple compounds simultaneously over the same surface. When
   specifically applied to small molecular weight compounds, such a
   strategy would however require prior knowledge of the refractive index
   increment of each compound in order to correctly interpret the recorded
   signal. An additional experiment is typically required to obtain this
   information. In this manuscript, we show that through the introduction
   of an additional global parameter corresponding to the ratio of the
   saturating signals associated with each molecule, the kinetic parameters
   could be identified with similar confidence intervals without any other
   experimentation.}},

Title = {{Integrating isolated and riparian wetland modules in the

Pages = {{4683-4702}},

Abstract = {{Mathematical modelling is a well-accepted framework to evaluate the
   effects of wetlands on stream flow and watershed hydrology in general.
   Although the integration of wetland modules into a distributed
   hydrological model represents a cost-effective way to make this
   assessment, the added value brought by landscape-specific modules to a
   model's ability to replicate basic hydrograph characteristics remains
   unclear. The objectives of this paper were the following: (i) to present
   the adaptation of PHYSITEL (a geographic information system) to
   parameterize isolated and riparian wetlands; (ii) to describe the
   integration of specific isolated wetland and riparian wetland modules
   into HYDROTEL, a distributed hydrological model; and (iii) to evaluate
   the performance of the updated modelling platform with respect to the
   capacity of replicating various hydrograph characteristics. To achieve
   this, two sets of simulations were performed (with and without wetland
   modules), and the added value was assessed at three river segments of
   the Becancour River watershed, Quebec, Canada, using six general
   goodness-of-fit indicators and 14 water flow criteria. A sensitivity
   analysis of the wetland module parameters was performed to characterize
   their impact on stream flows of the modelled watershed. Results of this
   study indicate the following: (i) integration of specific wetland
   modules can slightly increase the capacity of HYDROTEL to replicate
   basic hydrograph characteristics; and (ii) the updated modelling
   platform allows for the explicit assessment of the impact of wetlands
   (e.g. typology and location) on watershed hydrology. Copyright (c) 2015

Title = {{Localization of micro and nano- silica particles in a high interfacial
   tension poly(lactic acid)/low density polyethylene system}},
Journal = {{POLYMER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{156-166}},

Abstract = {{This work studies the effects of thermodynamic and kinetic parameters on
   the localization and migration of spherical micro- and nano-silica
   particles in the high interfacial tension blend system of poly (lactic
   acid), (PLA)/low density polyethylene (LDPE). The surface modification
   of micro-silica particles from a high to a low energy surface was
   carried out by the grafting of (2-Dodecen-1-yl) succinic anhydride to
   the surface of micro-silica particles using a new gas-phase reaction
   approach. The surface modification was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy analysis and surface energy measurements. Young's model
   predicts that the thermodynamic equilibrium localization of unmodified
   and modified silica particles in PLA/LDPE blends should be in the PLA
   phase and at the PLA-LDPE interface, respectively. Scanning electron
   microscopy results confirm that when unmodified micro- or nano-silica
   particles are added to a PLA/LDPE melt, the silica particles are
   selectively localized in the PLA phase even in the blend sample with
   only 5 vol.\% of PLA. However, the modified micro-silica particles were
   found to be located principally in the LDPE phase. The influence of
   kinetic parameters was imposed by premixing modified and unmodified
   micro-silica particles with a high viscosity LDPE phase (H-LDPE). In
   that case both silica types remain in the H-LDPE phase independent of
   shear rate and mixing time. When the viscosity of the LDPE phase is
   reduced, unmodified and modified micro-silica migrate to their
   thermodynamically predicted locations in the PLA phase and at the
   PLA-LDPE interface respectively. In the case of unmodified nano-silica
   particles premixed in the H-LDPE phase, individual well dispersed
   nano-silica particles migrate to the PLA phase while aggregates remain
   in the H-LDPE phase. These results have important implications in the
   field of nanocomposites and indicate that the localization of
   well-dispersed nanoparticles in a high interfacial tension multiphase
   system will not likely be influenced by kinetic effects. Kinetic effects
   are much more dominant in micro-scale silica systems and the kinetic
   effects are found to depend on a film-draining mechanism at the PLA-LDPE
   interface region. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We perform a finite element-based numerical analysis to calculate the

   and monodispersed, with tunable plasmonic resonance wavelength via
   change of the alloy composition. This enables their use in PA imaging as
   a contrast agent. This theoretical framework self-consistently solves
   the electromagnetic, thermodynamic and transient acoustic pressure
   physics using a multiphysics coupling approach. We model our system as
   an optically heterogeneous medium irradiated by a nanosecond laser pulse
   in the tissue therapeutic optical window (NIR irradiation, with
   wavelength of 800 nm). We calculate the PA signal generated by the
   photothermal expansion of both the particle and its surrounding medium.
   The results show the impact of the gold molar fraction (GMF) of Au-Ag
   alloy NPs on the PA signal for different NP sizes. We show that
   significantly stronger PA signals are achieved using Au-Ag alloy NPs
   (GMF = 0.55) in comparison with pure AuNPs (GMF = 1) and pure AgNPs (GMF

Abstract = {{We introduce the integrative cooperative search method (ICS), a
   multi-thread cooperative search method for multi-attribute combinatorial
   optimization problems. ICS musters the combined capabilities of a number

   these methods work on sub-problems defined by suitably selected subsets
   of decision-set attributes of the problem, while others combine the
   resulting partial solutions into complete ones and, eventually, improve
   them. All these methods cooperate through an adaptive search-guidance
   mechanism, using the central-memory cooperative search paradigm.
   Extensive numerical experiments explore the behavior of ICS and its
   interest through an application to the multi-depot, periodic vehicle
   routing problem, for which ICS improves the results of the current
   state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Association of

Abstract = {{This work studies the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters influencing
   the localization of micro- and nano-silica particles in multiphase
   mixtures of poly(lactic acid), (PLA), and poly(butylene
   adipate-co-terephthalate), PBAT. The surface energies of PLA and PBAT
   were measured at ambient and high temperature using contact angle and
   pendant drop techniques respectively. Based on this data, as well as
   that for silica, Young's model, which estimates the preferred lowest
   interfacial energy condition, predicts that silica particles should be
   located in the PBAT phase. Atomic force microscopy and scanning electron
   microscopy results confirm that when micro- or nano-silica particles are
   added to a PLA/PBAT melt, the silica particles are selectively localized
   in the PBAT phase irrespective of the PLA phase viscosity. The
   preferential encapsulation of silica particles by PBAT is shown to occur
   at the early stages of mixing. However, when micro- or nano-silica is
   initially distributed into the PLA melt prior to PLA/PBAT mixing, two
   distinct morphological behaviours are observed that persist over long
   mixing times. Nano-silica in PLA locates perfectly at the PLA/PBAT
   interface independently of the PLA viscosity while micro-silica locates
   at the interface with low viscosity PLA and stays distributed within the
   PLA when it is of high viscosity. It will be shown that the observed
   localization of micro- and nano-silica particles at the interface is due
   to the slow migration velocity of the particles at the interface that
   originates from the very low interfacial tension in this system. The
   localization of micro-silica particles in high viscosity PLA is related
   to the slow PLA film draining step close to the PLA-PBAT interface. (C)

Title = {{Spinal Cord Segmentation by One Dimensional Normalized Template
   Matching: A Novel, Quantitative Technique to Analyze Advanced Magnetic
   Resonance Imaging Data}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Spinal cord segmentation is a developing area of research intended to
   aid the processing and interpretation of advanced magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI). For example, high resolution three-dimensional volumes
   can be segmented to provide a measurement of spinal cord atrophy. Spinal
   cord segmentation is difficult due to the variety of MRI contrasts and
   the variation in human anatomy. In this study we propose a new method of
   spinal cord segmentation based on one-dimensional template matching and
   provide several metrics that can be used to compare with other
   segmentation methods. A set of ground-truth data from 10 subjects was
   manually-segmented by two different raters. These ground truth data
   formed the basis of the segmentation algorithm. A user was required to
   manually initialize the spinal cord center-line on new images, taking
   less than one minute. Template matching was used to segment the new cord
   and a refined center line was calculated based on multiple centroids
   within the segmentation. Arc distances down the spinal cord and
   cross-sectional areas were calculated. Inter-rater validation was
   performed by comparing two manual raters (n = 10). Semi-automatic
   validation was performed by comparing the two manual raters to the
   semi-automatic method (n = 10). Comparing the semi-automatic method to
   one of the raters yielded a Dice coefficient of 0.91 +/- 0.02 for ten
   subjects, a mean distance between spinal cord center lines of 0.32 +/-
   0.08 mm, and a Hausdorff distance of 1.82 +/- 0.33 mm. The absolute
   variation in cross-sectional area was comparable for the semi-automatic
   method versus manual segmentation when compared to inter-rater manual
   segmentation. The results demonstrate that this novel segmentation
   method performs as well as a manual rater for most segmentation metrics.
   It offers a new approach to study spinal cord disease and to
   quantitatively track changes within the spinal cord in an individual
   case and across cohorts of subjects.}},

Abstract = {{Increasingly complex numerical models are nowadays often utilized for

   proposed method is compared with the numerical differentiation formulas

Abstract = {{The moisture sorption isotherms of Algerian bay leaves (Laurus nobilis)
   were determined experimentally in this work. The equilibrium moisture
   contents of the leaves were measured at 40, 50, and 60 degrees C using
   static gravimetric method. Six mathematical models were tested to fit
   the experimental data of sorption isotherms and predict the hygroscopic
   behavior during storage or drying. Peleg model was found to be the best
   fitting model for describing the sorption curves. The net isosteric heat
   of sorption was computed from the equilibrium data at different
   temperatures by applying the integrated form of the Clausius-Clapeyron
   equation.
   The net isosteric heat of sorption is inversely proportional to the
   equilibrium moisture content and is found to be an exponential function

Abstract = {{study compared the performance of a pilot anaerobic sludge digester
   under different operating strategies. The influence of increasing
   organic loading rate - OLR (OP I) and the effect of hydraulic retention
   time - HRT reduction (OP II and OP III) in anaerobic process were
   evaluated. The applied loads ranged between 0.5 and 4.5
   kgSV.m(-3).d(-1); HRT was reduced from 15 to 5 days. Production of
   methane, organic matter degradation and microbial diversity were used to
   measure and compare the system's performance. Acclimation periods were
   taken for each new OLR applied, leading to instabilities in sludge VS
   and COD removals. The experimental time with HRT between 7 and 5 days
   showed the highest VS efficiency removals (higher than 70\%), which
   positively influenced process stability. The applied OLR of 2.5 and 3.5
   kgVS.m(-3).d(-1) resulted in higher yields of methane during OP I. CH4
   production showed impaired with HRT lower than 7 days, although it was
   observed active methanogenic microorganisms in the digester.
   Comparatively, HRT reduction resulted in a better system performance
   than the increasing OLR approach. The lower HRT applied, the better the
   results obtained in the operation of the digester, suggesting that the
   process efficiency is optimized with high load operation at low
   hydraulic retention times.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a review and a classification of interactive
   optimization methods. These interactive methods are used for solving
   optimization problems. The interaction with an end user or decision
   maker aims at improving the efficiency of the optimization procedure,
   enriching the optimization model, or informing the user regarding the
   solutions proposed by the optimization system. First, we present the
   challenges of using optimization methods as a tool for supporting
   decision making, and we justify the integration of the user in the
   optimization process. This integration is generally achieved via a
   dynamic interaction between the user and the system. Next, the different
   classes of interactive optimization approaches are presented. This
   detailed review includes trial and error, interactive reoptimization,
   interactive multiobjective optimization, interactive evolutionary
   algorithms, human-guided search, and other approaches that are less well
   covered in the research literature. On the basis of this review, we
   propose a classification that aims to better describe and compare
   interaction mechanisms. This classification offers two complementary
   views on interactive optimization methods. The first perspective focuses
   on the user's contribution to the optimization process, and the second
   concerns the components of interactive optimization systems. Finally, on
   the basis of this review and classification, we identify some open
   issues and potential perspectives for interactive optimization methods.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{46}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the design of adaptive laminar airfoils in the
   transonic flow regime using the gamma-(R) over tildee(theta t) model as
   a transition prediction method. A robust solution procedure for the
   transition model is described and a grid convergence study is presented.
   Predictions from the model are then compared to an extensive set of
   experimental results containing transition measurements on a morphing
   airfoil. It is shown that the sensitivity of the gamma-(R) over
   tildee(theta t) transition model with respect to shape variations allows
   its use in a design framework. Using a multi-point optimization
   strategy, the model is then used to design transonic airfoils suitable
   for a range of flow conditions. The potential improvement in drag
   associated with the implementation of adaptive airfoil technology is
   then carefully quantified using single-point optimization with the
   multi-point designed airfoil as a reference. Structural design
   constraints are taken into account to obtain a realistic estimate of
   possible drag reduction through airfoil morphing using current wing
   construction technology. Airfoil drag improvements of up to 4.6\% are
   obtained through morphing of the section of upper surface located
   between the wing spars with respect to the baseline multi-point design
   in flow conditions typical of large business jet operation. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A wide spectrum of accounting frameworks and models is available to
   describe socioeconomic metabolism (SEM). Despite the common system of
   study, a large variety of terms and representations of that system are
   used by different models. This makes it difficult for practitioners to
   compare and choose a model or model combination that is fit for purpose.
   To facilitate model comparison, we analyze the system structure of
   material flow analysis (MFA); life cycle assessment (LCA); supply and
   use tables (SUTs); Leontief, Ghosh, and waste input-output analysis;
   integrated assessment models; and computable general equilibrium models.
   We show that the typical system structure of MFA and LCA is a directed
   graph. For the other models and some MFA and LCA studies, the system
   structure is a bipartite directed graph. We demonstrate that bipartite
   directed graphs and SUTs are equivalent representations of SEM. We show
   that the system structures of the models above are special cases of a
   general system structure, which models SEM as a bipartite graph. The
   general system structure includes industries, markets, the final use
   phase, products, waste, production factors, resources, and emissions.
   From the general system structure, we derive an accounting framework in
   the form of a generalized SUT. The general system structure facilitates
   the development of clear and unambiguous terminology across models. It
   helps to identify rules for the correct accounting of waste flows and
   stock changes. It facilitates model comparison and can serve as a
   blueprint for a model-independent database of SEM.}},

Abstract = {{Late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging
   can detect the presence of myocardial infarction from ischemic
   cardiomyopathies (ICM). However, it is more challenging to detect
   diffuse myocardial fibrosis from non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) with
   this technique due to more subtle and heterogeneous enhancement of the
   myocardium. This study investigates whether high-resolution LGE CMR can
   detect age-related myocardial fibrosis using quantitative texture
   analysis with histological validation. LGE CMR of twenty-four rat hearts
   (twelve 6-week-old and twelve 2-year-old) was performed using a 7 T MRI
   scanner. Picrosirius red was used as the histopathology reference for
   collagen staining. Fibrosis in the myocardium was quantified with
   standard deviation (SD) threshold methods from the LGE CMR images and 3D
   contrast texture maps that were computed from gray level co-occurrence
   matrix of the CMR images. There was a significant increase of collagen
   fibers in the aged compared to the young rat histology slices (2.60 +/-
   0.27 \%LV vs. 1.24 +/- 0.29 \%LV, p < 0.01). Both LGE CMR and texture
   images showed a significant increase of myocardial fibrosis in the
   elderly compared to the young rats. Fibrosis in the LGE CMR images
   correlated strongly with histology with the 3 SD threshold (r=0.84,
   y=0.99x+0.00). Similarly, fibrosis in the contrast texture maps
   correlated with the histology using the 4 SD threshold (r=0.89,
   y=1.01x+0.00). High resolution ex-vivo LGE CMR can detect the presence
   of diffuse fibrosis that naturally developed in elderly rat hearts. Our
   results suggest that texture analysis may improve the assessment of
   myocardial fibrosis in LGE CMR images. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Chondroinduction Is the Main Cartilage Repair Response to Microfracture

   Histological Scoring and a Novel Zonal Collagen Type Scoring Method of
   Human Clinical Biopsy Specimens}},

Abstract = {{Background: Current cartilage repair histological scoring systems are
   unable to explain the relationship between collagen type II deposition
   and overall repair quality.
   Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to develop a novel
   zonal collagen type (ZCT) 5-point scoring system to measure
   chondroinduction in human clinical biopsy specimens collected after
   marrow stimulation. The hypothesis was that the ZCT scores would
   correlate with the International Cartilage Repair Society-II (ICRS-II)
   overall histological repair assessment score and glycosaminoglycan (GAG)
   content.
   Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study.
   Methods: After optimizing safranin O staining for GAG and immunostaining
   for human collagen type II and type I (Col2 and Col1, respectively),
   serial sections from clinical osteochondral repair biopsy specimens (13
   months after microfracture or microfracture with BST-CarGel; n = 39
   patients) were stained and 3 blinded readers performed histomorphometry
   for percentage of staining, ICRS-II histological scoring, polarized
   light microscopy (PLM) scoring, and 5-point ZCT scoring based on
   tidemark morphology, zonal distribution of Col2 and Col1, and Col1
   percentage stain. Because 1 biopsy specimen was missing bone, 38 biopsy
   specimens were evaluated for ICRS-II, PLM, and ZCT scores.
   Results: Chondroinduction was identified in 21 biopsy specimens as a
   Col2 matrix fused to bone that spanned the deep-middle-superficial zones
   (full-thickness hyaline repair), deep-middle zones, or deep zone
   (stalled hyaline) that was covered with a variable-thickness
   Col1-positive matrix, and was scored, respectively, as ZCT = 1 (n = 4
   biopsy specimens), ZCT = 2 (n = 6) and ZCT = 3 (n = 11). Other biopsy
   specimens (n = 17) were fibrocartilage (n = 9; ZCT = 4), fibrous tissue
   (n = 4, ZCT = 5), or non-marrow derived (n = 4; ZCT = 0). Non-marrow
   derived tissue had a mean mature tidemark score of 84 out of 100 versus
   a regenerating tidemark score of 24 for all other biopsy specimens (P =
   .005). Both ``stalled hyaline{''} repair and fibrocartilage had the same
   mean Col2 percentage stain; however, fibrocartilage was distinguished by
   heavy Col1 deposits in the deep zone, a 2-fold higher mean Col1
   percentage stain (P = .001), and lower surface integrity (P = .03). ZCT
   scores correlated with GAG content and the ICRS-II overall assessment
   score, especially when combined with the PLM score for collagen
   organization (R = 0.82). Histological scores of the deep zone strongly
   predicted the ICRS-II overall assessment score (R = 0.99).
   Conclusion: The ICRS-II overall repair assessment score and GAG content
   correlated with the extent of Col2 deposition free of fibrosis in the
   deep/middle zone rather than bulk accumulation of Col2.
   Clinical Relevance: Biopsy tissue from the BST-CarGel randomized
   clinical trial (microfracture without and with BST-CarGel, as treatment
   groups were not unblinded) showed regenerated tissue consistent with a
   chondroinduction mechanism in at least half of the treated lesions.}},

Abstract = {{In the last 10 or 15 years, exciting new developments have occurred in
   the field of filters and multiplexers. The two words that best explain
   this phenomenon are ``topology{''} and ``technology.{''} Thus, this
   paper will cover new connections, new materials, and new processes. This
   paper summarizes what is new, describes the new devices, and avoids
   simply surveying the entire field. It is not possible to cover
   everything, and regrettably, some new and possibly exciting areas are
   omitted (such as filters fabricated using liquid crystal polymers,
   active element inclusion, extreme power devices used in accelerators),
   and others,, because something has to be left for the next paper! The
   paper does cover bandstop filters, intrinsically switched film bulk
   acoustic resonator, and barium-strontium-titanate filters, brand new
   derivations of lossy filter synthesis and dual-band filter synthesis,
   multimode networks, new work on optimal multiplexer (multiport network)
   configurations, and substrate integrated waveguide filters. In each of
   these areas significant new work has been recently performed and is
   presented in a summary format suitable for those thinking that the area
   of filters and multiplexers has become mature (stagnant) with nothing
   interesting to learn. Nothing could be further from the truth!}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Visualization of small blood vessels feeding tumor sites
   provides important information on the tumors and their microenvironment.
   This information plays an important role in targeted drug therapies
   using magnetic gradients. However, capabilities of current clinical
   imaging modalities may be insufficient to resolve complex microvascular
   networks. The purpose of this study is to map the vascular network, 3D,
   based on the magnetic susceptibility contrast.
   Methods: Magnetic particles induce an inhomogeneity in the MRI's
   magnetic field in an order much larger than their real size. This is an
   approach to compensate the spatial resolution insufficiency of a
   clinical MR scanner. Micron-sized agglomerations of magnetite
   nanoparticles were injected in a 3D phantom vascular network, and a fast
   multislice, multiacquisition MR sequence was applied to track the
   agglomerations along their trajectories. The experiment was performed
   twice for two different imaging planes: coronal and transversal. The
   susceptibility artifact in the images indicated the presence and the
   position of the agglomerations. The calculated positions through
   multiple images were assembled to build up the 3D distribution of the
   vascular network.
   Results: The calculated points were compared with the centerline of the
   channels, extracted from the 3D reference image, to determine the
   absolute measurement error. The mean error was measured to be
   approximately half of the pixel's size. It was found that the
   positioning error on the axis perpendicular to the imaging slice was
   nearly twice as high as on the imaging plane axes due to the slice
   thickness. In order to compensate for the lack of resolution on the
   perpendicular axis, the reconstruction was performed using a combination
   of coronal and transversal data. The combination of the coordinates led
   to a significant decrease in the mean measurement error at each segment
   in the vascular network (p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: A method for 3D reconstruction of a microvascular network
   based on the susceptibility contrast in MRI and using a clinical scanner
   and a commercial receiver coil was proposed. The method presents a novel
   approach for reconstruction of vascular networks using the
   susceptibility effect. The proposed method may be applied to resolve
   vascular networks at a micrometric scale. (C) 2015 American Association

Abstract = {{We propose a method for filling gaps and removing interferences in time
   series for applications involving continuous monitoring of environmental
   variables. The approach is non-parametric and based on an iterative
   pattern-matching between the affected and the valid parts of the time
   series. It considers several variables jointly in the pattern matching
   process and allows preserving linear or non-linear dependences between
   variables. The uncertainty in the reconstructed time series is
   quantified through multiple realizations. The method is tested on
   self-potential data that are affected by strong interferences as well as
   data gaps, and the results show that our approach allows reproducing the
   spectral features of the original signal. Even in the presence of
   intense signal perturbations, it significantly improves the signal and
   corrects bias introduced by asymmetrical interferences. Potential
   applications are wide-ranging, including geophysics, meteorology and

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the advantage of using the kinematic theory of
   rapid human movements as a complementary approach to those based on
   classical dynamical features to characterize and analyze kindergarten
   children's ability to engage in graphomotor activities as a preparation
   for handwriting learning. This study analyzes nine different movements
   taken from 48 children evenly distributed among three different school
   grades corresponding to pupils aged 3, 4, and 5 years. On the one hand,
   our results show that the ability to perform graphomotor activities
   depends on kindergarten grades. More importantly, this study shows which
   performance criteria, from sophisticated neuromotor modeling as well as
   more classical kinematic parameters, can differentiate children of
   different school grades. These criteria provide a valuable tool for
   studying children's graphomotor control learning strategies. On the
   other hand, from a practical point of view, it is observed that school
   grades do not clearly reflect pupils' graphomotor performances. This
   calls for a large-scale investigation, using a more efficient
   experimental design based on the various observations made throughout
   this study regarding the choice of the graphic shapes, the number of
   repetitions and the features to analyze. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We size the shell thickness of a pressurised elliptical fuselage and
   analyse the weight gains or savings compared to a circular fuselage.
   Three fuselage construction cases are analysed: a monolithic
   construction, a symmetric sandwich with two facesheets of equal
   thicknesses separated by a lightweight core, and an unsymmetric sandwich
   with two facesheets of different thicknesses. We develop a proper
   dimensionless analysis comparing the proposed elliptical fuselage with a
   circular one for two different scenarios: equivalent cross-section areas
   and enclosing a similar rectangular box. We apply a semi-analytical thin
   shell theory to compute the loading due to pressurisation around the
   circumference of the fuselage cross-section. We select the facesheet
   thicknesses above and below the sandwich core at every location to
   minimise weight. The goal is to compute the structural weight gain or
   penalty that is incurred by replacing a circular fuselage with an
   elliptical one to resist internal pressurisation in function of the
   scenario, eccentricity, fuselage diameter, and sandwich core thickness.
   We find that an elliptical cross-section incurs a significant penalty in
   terms of necessary facesheet thickness even with an optimised
   unsymmetric sandwich construction. This penalty can be minimised by
   keeping the eccentricity low, the loading intensity low and the core
   thick. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Problem decomposition requires the ability to recombine partial
   solutions. This recombination task, which we call integration, is a
   fundamental feature of many methods, both those based on mathematical
   formulations such as Dantzig-Wolfe or Benders and those based on
   heuristics. Integration may be implicit in mathematical decompositions,
   but in heuristics this critical task is usually managed by ad-hoc
   operators, e.g., operators that combine decisions and heuristic
   adjustments to manage incompatibilities. In this paper, we propose a
   general framework for integration, which is viewed as a problem in
   itself with well-defined objectives and constraints. Four different
   mechanisms are proposed, based on well-known concepts from the
   literature such as constraining or giving incentives to particular
   characteristics of partial solutions. We perform computational
   experiments on the multi-depot periodic vehicle routing problem to
   compare the various integration approaches. The strategy that places
   incentives on selected solution characteristics rather than imposing
   constraints seems to yield the best results in the context of a
   cooperative search for this problem.}},

Volume = {{295}},

Abstract = {{We present an adaptive algorithm for time integration of fluid-structure
   integration problems. The method relies on a fully coupled procedure to
   solve FSI problems in which a naturally GCL-compliant ALE formulation
   for the finite-element spatial discretization is used. The main
   originality of the proposed solution procedure is that time integration
   is performed using automatic order and stepsize selections
   (hp-adaptivity) based on the Backward Differentiation Formulas (BDF).
   The stepsize selection is based on a local error estimate, an error
   controller and a step rejection mechanism. It guarantees that the
   solution precision is within the user targeted tolerance. The order
   selection is based on a stability test and a quarantine mechanism. The
   selection is performed to ensure that no other methods within the family
   of 0-stable BDF methods would produce a solution of the targeted
   precision for a larger stepsize (and thus a lower computational time).
   To improve efficiency, the time integration procedure also relies on a
   modified Newton method and a predictor. The time adaptive algorithm
   behaviors and performances are assessed on the vortex-induced
   translational and rotational vibrations of a square cylinder and on the
   wake-induced vibrations of 3 cylinders in an in-line arrangement. The
   algorithm yields substantial CPU time savings (compared to constant
   stepsize and order integration) while delivering solutions of prescribed
   accuracies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To assess the relationship between exercise intensity, cerebral HbO(2)
   and cognitive performance (Executive and non-Executive) in young adults.
   We measured reaction time (RT) and accuracy, during a computerized
   Stroop task, in 19 young adults (7 males and 12 females). Their mean +/-
   A SD age, height, body mass and body mass index (BMI) were 24 +/- A 4
   years, 1.67 +/- A 0.07 m, 72 +/- A 14 kg and 25 +/- A 3 kg m(-2),
   respectively. Each subject performed the Stroop task at rest and during
   cycling at exercise of low intensity {[}40 \% of peak power output
   (PPO)], moderate intensity (60 \% of PPO) and high intensity (85 \% of
   PPO). Cerebral oxygenation was monitored during the resting and exercise
   conditions over the prefrontal cortex (PFC) using near-infrared
   spectroscopy (NIRS).
   High-intensity exercise slowed RT in both the Naming (p = 0.04) and the
   Executive condition (p = 0.04). The analysis also revealed that
   high-intensity exercise was associated with a decreased accuracy when
   compared to low-intensity exercise (p = 0.021). Neuroimaging results
   confirm a decrease of cerebral oxygenation during high-intensity
   exercise in comparison to low- (p = 0.004) and moderate-intensity
   exercise (p = 0.003). Correlations revealed that a lower cerebral HbO(2)
   in the prefrontal cortex was associated with slower RT in the Executive
   condition only (p = 0.04, g = -0.72).
   Results of the present study suggest that low to moderate exercise
   intensity does not alter Executive functioning, but that exercise
   impairs cognitive functions (Executive and non-Executive) when the
   physical workload becomes heavy. The cerebral HbO(2) correlation
   suggests that a lower availability of HbO(2) was associated with slower
   RT in the Executive condition only.}},

Abstract = {{Miniaturization is a major challenge in fabricating medical microrobots
   designed to operate inside the human body. Current microrobots lack an
   adequate embedded communication system to transmit sensory data due to a
   shortage of power. In this paper, we propose a communication method,
   using the susceptibility effect in MRI, to overcome the size and power
   constraints in microrobots. The proposed method relies on a binary
   communication scheme in the form of a frequency alteration in the
   electrical current circulating along a miniature coil embedded in a
   microrobot. The frequency of the electrical current could be regulated
   by a predetermined sensory threshold input implemented in the
   microrobot. Such a frequency provides information on the level of
   sensory information gathered by the microrobot, and it is determined
   using single-shot EPIGE MR images. The proposed method is independent of
   the microrobot's position and orientation. Moreover, the experiments
   showed that MRI is sensitive enough to detect the change in magnetic
   field if we scaled the coil to an appropriate size for embedding into
   the microrobot. The proposed (m)ethod could potentially apply to
   microrobots for monitoring and mapping specific physiological conditions

Abstract = {{Breast implants are amongst the most widely used types of permanent
   implants in modern medicine and have both aesthetic and reconstructive
   applications with excellent biocompatibility. The double capsule is a
   complication associated with textured prostheses that leads to implant
   displacement; however, its etiology has yet to be elucidated. In this
   study, 10 double capsules were sampled from breast expander implants for
   in-depth analysis; histologically, the inner capsular layer demonstrated
   highly organized collagen in sheets with delamination of fibers. At the
   prosthesis interface (PI) where the implant shell contacts the inner
   capsular layer, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed a thin layer
   which mirrored the three-dimensional characteristics of the implant
   texture; the external surface of the inner capsular layer facing the
   intercapsular space (ICS) was flat. SEM examination of the inner capsule
   layer revealed both a large bacterial presence as well as biofilm
   deposition at the PI; a significantly lower quantity of bacteria and
   biofilm were found at the ICS interface. These findings suggest that the
   double capsule phenomenon's etiopathogenesis is of mechanical origin.
   Delamination of the periprosthetic capsule leads to the creation of the
   ICS; the maintained separation of the 2 layers subsequently alters the
   biostability of the macro-textured breast implant. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper provides a selective eraser of curvature extrema for B-spline
   curves. It is introduced as an extension to the standard least squares
   method for approximating a series of points using a B-spline. The
   extension consists in adding constraints to produce segments of curve
   with monotone increase or decrease of curvature. The primal-dual
   interior point method is used to solve the constrained optimization
   problem. The method requires gradients that are computed using B-spline
   symbolic operators. Therefore, the algorithm relies on the arithmetic
   and differential properties of B-splines. The variation-diminishing
   property of B-splines is also exploited to apply the constraints.
   The application examples consist in producing fair curves from measured
   points over airfoils. The data come from the publicly available UIUC
   database. The data contains a fair amount of noise for some airfoils.
   Especially in these circumstances, a fixed number of segments with
   monotonic variation of curvature hold great promise to produce curves
   that are, at once, very general and uncompromising over oscillations.

Abstract = {{Time synchronization is a fundamental requirement for many services
   provided by distributed systems. For this purpose, several time
   synchronization protocols have been proposed. However, they either
   achieve high accuracy by adding further network traffic, even more than
   common protocols such as network time protocol and precision time
   protocol, or consume a lot of time in additional computations. An online
   distributed tracing and monitoring system, used to identify functional
   and performance problems in distributed systems, must offer high
   precision with minimum time overhead and system resource consumption.
   The aim of this paper is to propose an efficient algorithm for time
   synchronization in online mode, applicable for all distributed services.
   The proposed method in this paper addresses five key requirements for a
   practical solution in distributed systems. First, it provides
   microseconds scale accuracy, which is applicable for trace events with
   nanosecond timestamp granularity. Secondly, it does not require adding
   new network traffic, using the send and receive time of existing
   traffic. Thirdly, it synchronizes the distributed traces in average time
   complexity of O(1) per synchronization update. Fourthly, it updates
   online synchronization parameters immediately without latency. Finally,
   it iteratively refines the early estimates without requiring significant
   buffering of earlier data. Although we used this work for distributed
   trace synchronization, it is a general, fully incremental, continuous
   synchronization approach applicable to most synchronization purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Textile permeability is a fundamental property to describe preform
   impregnation in Liquid Composite Molding (LCM) processes. It depends on
   textile architecture and fiber volume content (PVC). Conventional
   methods to measure in-plane permeability are based on radial or
   unidirectional injection experiments performed at fixed PVC. A complete
   characterization involves a series of tests and requires several
   material samples. This study presents a novel approach to characterize
   permeability as a function of PVC through a unique unidirectional
   injection experiment with a preform containing different PVC sections.
   The same experimental set-up as in conventional unidirectional
   unsaturated permeability measurements is used with a second pressure
   transducer embedded in the mold in addition to the one located at the
   inlet gate. A fast algorithm is developed to exploit the data from the
   two sensors and automatically derive the permeability distribution
   without any need of visual flow front observations. The methodology is
   validated with a random fiber mat and a woven fabric. Results show that
   accurate permeability characterization can be achieved for both kinds of
   textiles. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a fractional flow model based on two-phase flow,
   resin and air, through a porous medium to simulate numerically Liquid
   Composites Molding (LCM) processes. It allows predicting the formation,
   transport and compression of voids in the modeling of LCM. The equations
   are derived by combining Darcy's law and mass conservation for each
   phase (resin/air). In the model, the relative permeability and capillary
   pressure depend on saturation. The resin is incompressible and the air
   slightly compressible. Introducing some simplifications, the fractional
   flow model consists of a saturation equation coupled with a
   pressure/velocity equation including the effects of air solubility and
   compressibility. The introduction of air compressibility in the pressure
   equation allows for the numerical prediction of the experimental
   behavior at low constant resin injection flow rate. A good agreement was
   obtained between the numerical prediction of saturation in a glass fiber
   reinforcement and the experimental observations during the filling of a
   test mold by Resin Transfer Molding (RTM). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA) model is often used nowadays for
   prediction of the thermodynamic properties of materials subjected to

   consistent because it leads to violations of the Maxwell relations. The
   aim of this work is to propose a new thermodynamically self-consistent
   (TSC) method based on Density Functional Theory (DFT). The proposed
   method requires minimum information from DFT and no sophisticated
   equation of state is needed. The TSC method is applied to predicting the
   thermophysical properties of B1 CaO and K2O up to 2000 K and 100 GPa. It
   is shown that the TSC method is consistent with Maxwell relations and is

Abstract = {{This paper is to investigate numerically the photothermal response of
   the most common size of gold nanoshell (AuNS) in an aqueous medium for
   biomedical applications. Three types of laser light irradiate the
   particle; a continuous-wave (CW), short (nanosecond) and ultrashort
   (femtosecond) pulse laser. The spatiotemporal evolution of the
   temperature profile inside and around the AuNS is computed using a
   numerical framework based on the finite element method (FEM). For CW and
   nanosecond (ns) pulse laser where the AuNS's electrons and lattice are
   at thermal equilibrium, the ordinary heat diffusion equation is used to
   describe the heat transfer to the surrounding water. For femtosecond
   (fs) pulse laser, due to the inexistence of the thermal equilibrium, a
   two-temperature model (TTM) is used to describe the heat transfer
   processes occurring in the AuNS and the normal heat diffusion equation
   is used for the heat flux calculation at the particle/water interface.
   For each case, the influence of laser intensity on the maximum
   temperature reached at the particle/water interface is studied. The aim
   of this study is to provide a description for the fundamentals of heat
   release of AuNSs and useful insights for the development of these
   particles for biomedical applications such as drug delivery,
   photothermal cancer therapy and optoporation of cells. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The effects of particulate attached bacteria (PAR) and phycocyanin on
   the simultaneous biodegradation of a mixture of microcystin-LR, YR. LY,
   LW, LF and cylindrospermopsin (CYN) was assessed in clarifier sludge of
   a drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) and in a drinking water source.
   The biomass from lake water and clarifier sludge was able to degrade all
   microcystins (MCs) at initial concentrations of 10 mu g L-1 with
   pseudo-first order reaction half-lives ranging from 2.3 to 8.8 days. CYN
   was degraded only in the sludge with a biodegradation rate of 1.0 x
   10(-1) d(-1) and a half-life of 6.0 days. This is the first study
   reporting multiple MCs and CYN biodegradation in the
   coagulation-flocculation sludge of a DWTP. The removal of PAR from the
   lake water and the sludge prolonged the lag time substantially, such
   that no biodegradation of MCLY, LW and LF was observed within 24 days.
   Biodegradation rates were shown to increase in the presence of
   C-phycocyanin as a supplementary carbon source for indigenous bacteria,
   a cyanobacterial product that accompanies cyanotoxins during
   cyanobacteria blooms. MCs in mixtures degraded more slowly (or not at

Abstract = {{A Generation Expansion Planning problem with load uncertainty is
   formulated based on joint chance-constrained programming (CCP) and is
   solved by incorporating sensitivity into iterative algorithms. These
   algorithms exploit the characteristics of the system and its response to
   load variations. Sensitivities help to classify buses according to
   stress level, and sensitivity-based iterative algorithms distinguish
   each bus based on its contribution to the overall system reliability.
   The use of sensitivity overcomes some of the mathematical obstacles to
   solving joint CCP problems and, in addition, leads to optimal expansion
   solutions because uncertain loads are correctly estimated. The IEEE 30-
   and 118-bus test systems are used to demonstrate the proposed
   algorithms, and the results Of these algorithms are compared with those
   of other algorithms for solving the joint CCP problem. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{The robotic arm on the International Space Station, Canadarm2, is
   susceptible to damage by orbital debris impact; evaluating its residual
   stiffness and resistance is thus of prime importance. Four cylinders,
   made of 19-ply carbon fiber IM7/PEEK laminates, each with a diameter of
   35 cm, representative of the structure of Canadarm2, were subjected to
   hypervelocity impacts. Aluminum projectiles with diameters of 5.56 mm
   and 7.94 mm and velocities of similar to 7 km/s were used for the tests.
   Imaging of the damaged zones was performed and the cylinders were
   thereafter subjected to fatigue tests by bending them under load
   amplitudes of similar to 2.5 kNm or similar to 4.5 kNm. The damaged
   zones were positioned close to the neutral plane in one test and far
   from the neutral plane in three tests. Damage propagation was detected
   using similar to 4.5 kNm load amplitude for the damage that was far from
   the neutral plane, demonstrating that impacts of this nature on
   Canadarm2 could be problematic for its continued use at this level of
   loading. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{298}},
Pages = {{125-144}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{The validation process proposed by Babuska etal. {[}1] is applied to
   thermochemical models describing post-shock flow conditions. In this
   validation approach, experimental data is involved only in the
   calibration of the models, and the decision process is based on
   quantities of interest (QoIs) predicted on scenarios that are not
   necessarily amenable experimentally. Moreover, uncertainties present in
   the experimental data, as well as those resulting from an incomplete
   physical model description, are propagated to the QoIs. We investigate
   four commonly used thermochemical models: a one-temperature model (which
   assumes thermal equilibrium among all inner modes), and two-temperature
   models developed by Macheret etal. {[}2], Marrone and Treanor {[}3], and
   Park {[}4]. Up to 16 uncertain parameters are estimated using Bayesian
   updating based on the latest absolute volumetric radiance data collected
   at the Electric Arc Shock Tube (EAST) installed inside the NASA Ames
   Research Center. Following the solution of the inverse problems, the
   forward problems are solved in order to predict the radiative heat flux,
   QoI, and examine the validity of these models. Our results show that all
   four models are invalid, but for different reasons: the one-temperature
   model simply fails to reproduce the data while the two-temperature
   models exhibit unacceptably large uncertainties in the QoI predictions.

Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{23-35}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we solve the pickup and delivery problem with time
   windows and last-in-first-out (LIFO) loading. LIFO loading minimizes
   handling while unloading items from the vehicle: the items are loaded
   according to a linear stack structure, and an item can only be delivered
   if it is the one on top of the stack. Three exact branch-price-and-cut
   algorithms are available for this problem. These can solve instances
   with up to 75 requests within one hour. We propose a population-based
   metaheuristic capable of handling larger instances much faster. First, a
   set of initial solutions is generated with a greedy randomized adaptive
   search procedure. For each of these solutions, local search is applied
   in order to first decrease the total number of vehicles and then the
   total traveled distance. Two different strategies are used to create
   offspring. The first selects vehicle routes from the solution pool. The
   second selects two parents to create an offspring with a crossover
   operator. For both strategies, local search is then performed on the
   child solution. Finally, the offspring is added to the population and
   the best survivors are kept. The population is managed so as to maintain
   good quality solutions with respect to total cost and population
   diversity. Computational results on medium to large instances confirm
   the effectiveness of the proposed metaheuristic. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The flexural performance of fibre reinforced concrete (FRC) materials is
   directly related to the stress-crack opening diagram (COD). This diagram
   is needed for structural design applications because it represents the
   energy change in the fracture process zone at the material level. In
   this paper, a novel inverse analysis procedure for the determination of
   the COD for FRC standard beams (EN14651) and round panels (ASTM C1550)
   is presented and validated. This procedure is based on a data fitting
   algorithm, for which the shape of the COD is not fixed a priori (free to
   vary). The efficiency of this procedure is demonstrated through
   experimental results for the three-points notched beam and the round
   panel standardised FRC characterisation tests. It is worthy to mention
   that inverse analysis procedures for panels are, to author's knowledge,
   very scarce, and this procedure can be easily extended to cover several
   kinds of beams and panels. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{SEP 28}},
Abstract = {{The influence of penetrable and curved carbon nanotubes (CNT) on the
   charge percolation in three-dimensional disordered CNT networks have
   been studied with Monte-Carlo simulations. By considering carbon
   nanotubes as solid objects but where the overlap between their electron
   cloud can be controlled, we observed that the structural characteristics
   of networks containing lower aspect ratio CNT are highly sensitive to
   the degree of penetration between crossed nanotubes. Following our
   efficient strategy to displace CNT to different positions to create more
   realistic statistical models, we conclude that the connectivity between
   objects increases with the hard-core/soft-shell radii ratio. In
   contrast, the presence of curved CNT in the random networks leads to an
   increasing percolation threshold and to a decreasing electrical
   conductivity at saturation. The waviness of CNT decreases the effective
   distance between the nanotube extremities, hence reducing their
   connectivity and degrading their electrical properties. We present the
   results of our simulation in terms of thickness of the CNT network from
   which simple structural parameters such as the volume fraction or the
   carbon nanotube density can be accurately evaluated with our more
   realistic models. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Generation of Rabi-frequency radiation using exciton-polaritons}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP 16}},
Abstract = {{We study the use of exciton-polaritons in semiconductor microcavities to
   generate radiation spanning the infrared to terahertz regions of the
   spectrum by exploiting transitions between upper and lower polariton
   branches. The process, which is analogous to difference-frequency
   generation (DFG), relies on the use of semiconductors with a
   nonvanishing second-order susceptibility. For an organic microcavity
   composed of a nonlinear optical polymer, we predict a DFG irradiance
   enhancement of 2.8 x 10(2), as compared to a bare nonlinear polymer
   film, when triple resonance with the fundamental cavity mode is
   satisfied. In the case of an inorganic microcavity composed of (111)
   GaAs, an enhancement of 8.8 x 10(3) is found, as compared to a bare GaAs
   slab. Both structures show high wavelength tunability and relaxed design
   constraints due to the high modal overlap of polariton modes.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present the development of a nanoswitch-based
   electrochemical surface plasmon resonance (eSPR) transducer for the
   multiplexed and selective detection of DNA and other biomolecules
   directly in complex media. To do so, we designed an experimental set-up
   for the synchronized measurements of electrochemical and
   electro-plasmonic responses to the activation of multiple
   electrochemically labeled structure-switching biosensors. As a proof of
   principle, we adapted this strategy for the detection of DNA sequences
   that are diagnostic of two pathogens (drug-resistant tuberculosis and
   Escherichia coil) by using methylene blue-labeled structure-switching
   DNA stem-loop. The experimental sensitivity of the switch-based eSPR
   sensor is estimated at 5 nM and target detection is achieved within
   minutes. Each sensor is reusable several times with a simple 8 M urea
   washing procedure. We then demonstrated the selectivity and multiplexed
   ability of these switch-based eSPR by simultaneously detecting two
   different DNA sequences. We discuss the advantages of the proposed eSPR
   approach for the development of highly selective sensor devices for the
   rapid and reliable detection of multiple molecular markers in complex
   samples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   sensitivity of the fiber sensor to changes in the real part of the core
   refractive index is found to be 1460nm/Refractive index unit (RIU). By
   using spectral modality and effective medium theory, we determine the
   concentrations of the two commercial fluids from the measured refractive
   indices with an accuracy of similar to 0.57\% for both low-and high-loss
   oils. Moreover, using an amplitude-based detection modality allows

Abstract = {{CHO cell culture high productivity relies on optimized culture medium
   management under fed-batch or perfused chemostat strategies enabling
   high cell densities. In this work, a dynamic metabolic model for CHO
   cells was further developed, calibrated and challenged using datasets
   obtained under four different culture conditions, including two batch
   and two fed-batch cultures comparing two different culture media. The
   recombinant CHO-DXB11 cell line producing the EG2-hFc monoclonal
   antibody was studied. Quantification of extracellular substrates and
   metabolites concentration, viable cell density, monoclonal antibody
   concentration and intracellular concentration of metabolite
   intermediates of glycolysis, pentose-phosphate and TCA cycle, as well as
   of energetic nucleotides, were obtained for model calibration. Results
   suggest that a single model structure with a single set of kinetic
   parameter values is efficient at simulating viable cell behavior in all
   cases under study, estimating the time course of measured and
   non-measured intracellular and extracellular metabolites. Model
   simulations also allowed performing dynamic metabolic flux analysis,
   showing that the culture media and the fed-batch strategies tested had
   little impact on flux distribution. This work thus paves the way to an
   in silico platform allowing to assess the performance of different

Journal = {{MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS}},

Abstract = {{A simple process is reported of the large-scale synthesis of
   microspherical mixed phase alpha-and beta-Ni (OH)(2) nanofibers produced
   by precipitation from aqueous NiCl2-NH4OH. These microspheres, with
   diameters of 20-50 mu m, are composed of three-dimensional, nanoporous
   nanofibers, oriented along the radial direction. The nanofibers have
   lengths of 300-1000 nm, diameters of 30-50 nm and a specific surface
   area of 286.4 m(2) g(-1). The effects of temperature and concentration
   on the morphology of the products were studied systematically, and the
   nanofiber growth mechanism was investigated. It was found that the
   nanostructure of Ni(OH)(2) could be changed from microspheres to
   nanoflakes, to nanofibers and nanoparticles, as the NiCl2 concentration
   is increased from 2 to 8 M, and for NH4OH concentrations from 10 to 14
   M. The as-synthesized nanofibers exhibit excellent charge-discharge
   performance and the highest yet capacitance of 1271 F g(-1) for
   electrochemical supercapacitors, which is much higher than
   beta-Ni(OH)(2) nanoplates (797 F g(-1)) and commercial Ni(OH)(2) powder
   (529.4 F g(-1)) at 1 A g(-1) current density. The results indicate that
   as-synthesized hierarchical nanofibers, composed of mixed a-and
   beta-Ni(OH)(2) phases, are an excellent candidate for energy storage
   applications. The large-scale commercialization of our
   laboratory-produced nanofibers is also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Many combinatorial problems require that their solutions achieve a
   certain balance of given features. For this important aspect of
   modeling, the spread and deviation constraints have been proposed in
   Constraint Programming to express balance among a set of variables by
   constraining their mean and overall deviation from the mean. To our
   knowledge, the only practical filtering algorithms known for these
   constraints achieve bounds consistency. In this paper we improve that
   filtering by presenting an efficient domain consistency algorithm that
   applies to both constraints. We also extend it to count solutions so
   that it can be used in counting-based search, a generic and effective
   family of branching heuristics that free the user from having to write
   problem-specific search heuristics. We provide a time complexity
   analysis of our contributions and empirically evaluate them on benchmark

Abstract = {{In this article, we propose a general framework for an algorithm derived
   from the primal simplex that guarantees a strict improvement in the
   objective after each iteration. Our approach relies on the
   identification of compatible variables that ensure a nondegenerate
   iteration if pivoted into the basis. The problem of finding a strict
   improvement in the objective function is proved to be equivalent to two
   smaller problems, respectively, focusing on compatible and incompatible
   variables. We then show that the improved primal simplex (IPS) is a
   particular implementation of this generic theoretical framework. The
   resulting new description of IPS naturally emphasizes what should be
   considered as necessary adaptations of the framework versus specific
   implementation choices. This provides original insight into IPS that
   allows for the identification of weaknesses and potential alternative
   choices that would extend the efficiency of the method to a wider set of
   problems. We perform experimental tests on an extended collection of
   data sets including instances of Mittelmann's benchmark for linear
   programming. The results confirm the excellent potential of IPS and
   highlight some of its limits while showing a path toward an improved
   implementation of the generic algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional and dark-field microscopy in the transmission mode is
   extensively used for single plasmonic nanoparticle (NP) imaging and
   spectral analysis. However, application of the transmission mode for
   real-time biosensing to single NP poses strict limitations on the size
   and material properties of the microfluidic system. This article
   proposes a simple optical technique based on reflected light microscopy
   to perform microspectroscopy of a single NP placed in a conventional,
   nontransparent liquid delivery system. The insertion of a variable spot
   diaphragm in the optical path reduces the interference effect that
   occurs at the NP-substrate interface and improves the signal-to-noise
   ratio in NP imaging. Using this method, we demonstrated spatial imaging
   and spectral analyses of 60-, 80-, and 100-nm single gold NPs. A
   single-NP sensor based on a 100-nm NP was used for real-time measurement
   of bulk refractive index changes in the microfluidic channel and for
   detection of fast dynamic poly(ethylene glycol) attachment to the NP
   surface. Finally, electrochemical single-particle microspectroscopy was
   demonstrated by using a methylene blue electroactive redox tag. The
   proposed optical approach is expected to significantly improve the
   miniaturization and multiplexing capabilities of high-throughput
   biosensing based on single NP. (C) 2015 Society of Photo-Optical

Title = {{A generic conceptual framework based on formal representation for the

Abstract = {{Modern systems integrate components specific to different application
   domains. Frequently, these systems combine continuous and discrete
   sub-systems and therefore their design involves overcoming specific
   global modeling and validation challenges. In order to generate global
   simulation models of heterogeneous systems the designers need efficient
   tools for systems' validation. Therefore, a new type of designers
   emerged, the designers of co-simulation tools. Their main objective is
   to provide coherent tools for the co-simulation models' designers. Given
   the diversity of abstractions, languages and simulation tools, the
   design of co-simulation tools may be costly and time consuming. Thus,
   the key for the improvement of the validation process is to define a
   model-based generic approach before the implementation of these tools.
   This requires new skills on formalism and formal verification domain.
   This paper proposes a generic conceptual framework based on formal
   representation of the co-simulation interfaces for co-simulation tools
   design. The framework can be used to provide rigorous global formal
   co-simulation models for continuous/discrete heterogeneous systems. It
   allows the definition for implementation of the co-simulation interfaces
   starting with their formal definitions that are gradually refined and
   verified. The global formal model also provides the rules for the
   implementation and the generation of the interfaces. The framework is
   the skeleton on which the designers can build accurate tools for global
   execution models of continuous/discrete heterogeneous systems. The
   approach was used to design a co-simulation tool that is presented in
   this paper.}},

Abstract = {{We calibrated the magnitude and symmetry of seismic anisotropy for 132
   mica- or amphibole-bearing metamorphic rocks to constrain their
   departures from transverse isotropy (TI) which is usually assumed in the
   interpretation of seismic data. The average bulk V-p anisotropy at
   600MPa for the chlorite schists, mica schists, phyllites,
   sillimanite-mica schists, and amphibole schists examined is 12.0\%,
   12.8\%, 12.8\%, 17.0\%, and 12.9\%, respectively. Most of the schists
   show V-p anisotropy in the foliation plane which averages 2.4\% for
   phyllites, 3.3\% for mica schists, 4.1\% for chlorite schists, 6.8\% for
   sillimanite-mica schists, and 5.2\% for amphibole schists. This
   departure from TI is due to the presence of amphibole, sillimanite, and
   quartz. Amphibole and sillimanite develop strong crystallographic
   preferred orientations with the fast c axes parallel to the lineation,
   forming orthorhombic anisotropy with V-p(X)>V-p(Y)>V-p(Z). Effects of
   quartz are complicated, depending on its volume fraction and prevailing
   slip system. Most of the mica- or amphibole-bearing schists and
   mylonites are approximately transversely isotropic in terms of S wave
   velocities and splitting although their P wave properties may display
   orthorhombic symmetry. The results provide insight for the
   interpretation of seismic data from the southeast Tibetan Plateau. The
   N-S to NW-SE polarized crustal anisotropy in the Sibumasu and Indochina
   blocks is caused by subvertically foliated mica- and amphibole-bearing
   rocks deformed by predominantly compressional folding and subordinate
   strike-slip shear. These blocks have been rotated clockwise 70-90
   degrees around the east Himalayan Syntaxis, without finite eastward or
   southeastward extrusion, in responding to progressive indentation of
   India into Asia.}},

Abstract = {{With the current increase of environmental concerns, conventional
   methods practiced at end-of-life would not be capable to sustain the
   growing amount of retired aircrafts waiting for final disposal in the
   scrap yards each year. Material recycling is known as an important
   environmentally friendly activity. The quality of recycled material in a
   recycling process is actively influenced by an appropriate
   disassembly/dismantling strategy. In recycling the carcass of the
   aircraft, it is suitable to separate and classify different aluminum
   grades into their main alloys family before sending them to recycling
   center (i.e. 2xxx and 7xxx). However, due to complexity in the aircraft
   structure, fully disassembly/dismantling or fully shredding the aircraft
   is not economically or environmentally viable, respectively. For this
   reason, this work discusses eight different disassembly/dismantling
   strategies that have been done on a real Bombardier Regional Jet
   aircraft. The study narrows the gap in sustainability evaluation of
   these strategies by using an efficient fuzzy assessment method. Ten
   different risk scenarios were considered to have a robust understanding
   about the sustainability performance of each strategy. The methodology
   used in this work allowed to select the best strategy in terms of
   sustainable disassembly/dismantling. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Impact of Wind Direction, Wind Speed, and Particle Characteristics on
   the Collection Efficiency of the Double Fence Intercomparison Reference}},

Abstract = {{The accurate measurement of snowfall is important in various fields of
   study such as climate variability, transportation, and water resources.
   A major concern is that snowfall measurements are difficult and can
   result in significant errors. For example, collection efficiency of most
   gauge-shield configurations generally decreases with increasing wind
   speed. In addition, much scatter is observed for a given wind speed,
   which is thought to be caused by the type of snowflake. Furthermore, the
   collection efficiency depends strongly on the reference used to correct
   the data, which is often the Double Fence Intercomparison Reference
   (DFIR) recommended by the World Meteorological Organization. The goal of
   this study is to assess the impact of weather conditions on the
   collection efficiency of the DFIR. Note that the DFIR is defined as a
   manual gauge placed in a double fence. In this study, however, only the
   double fence is being investigated while still being called DFIR. To
   address this issue, a detailed analysis of the flow field in the
   vicinity of the DFIR is conducted using computational fluid dynamics.
   Particle trajectories are obtained to compute the collection efficiency
   associated with different precipitation types for varying wind speed.
   The results show that the precipitation reaching the center of the DFIR
   can exceed 100\% of the actual precipitation, and it depends on the
   snowflake type, wind speed, and direction. Overall, this study
   contributes to a better understanding of the sources of uncertainty
   associated with the use of the DFIR as a reference gauge to measure
   snowfall.}},

Abstract = {{Petrological, geochemical and in-situ zircon U-Pb dating and Hf-isotope
   analyses have been carried out on a suite of basalt-andesite-rhyolite
   volcanic rocks exposed in the Liuluocun area, Hainan Island, SE China.
   Zircon analyses show that these volcanic rocks crystallized in the Early
   Cretaceous (ca. 102 Ma). The basalts are characterized by low MgO
   contents and mg-numbers but high rare earth element, high field strength
   element and large ion lithophile element contents and Nb-Ta negative
   anomalies. They have relatively uniform Sr-Nd isotope compositions with
   epsilon(Nd)(t) values of -4.09 to -3.63. The andesites show enrichment
   of high field strength element and rare earth element with negligible Eu
   anomalies. They have epsilon(Nd)(t) values of -2.35 to -3.88 and
   epsilon(Hf)(t) values of -9.73 to -1.13. The rhyolites have high K2O and
   SiO2 contents. They are characterized by prominent Eu, P and Ti negative
   anomalies and enrichment in large ion lithophile element, and show
   epsilon(Hf)(t) values of -7.51 to +0.47 and epsilon(Nd)(t) values of
   -2.49 to -2.69. Petrogenetic analysis indicates that the Liuluocun
   volcanic rocks were produced by incomplete reaction of the mantle wedge
   peridotite with felsic melts derived from partial melting of subducted
   sediment. All these characteristics, combined with geological
   observations, suggest that their formation was related to regional
   lithospheric extension in the South China Craton during the Early
   Cretaceous, which may have been caused by subduction of the
   Paleo-Pacific plate beneath the continental plate of China. (C) 2015

Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Innovation in space science and technology involves interactions among
   players from the public and private sectors. Interinstitutional and
   intersectoral collaborations have been proven to stimulate innovative
   activities and improve their outcomes in many activity sectors. The
   government of Canada, including its designated agency for space-related
   affairs, the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), is one of the major players in
   the Canadian space sector and has played an important role in
   encouraging these collaborations. Consequently, Canadian government
   organizations emphasize the importance of interinstitutional
   collaboration in accelerating innovation, promoting spin-offs, and
   ensuring sustainable funding for research and innovation programs. How
   should collaborations be measured, reported on, and evaluated? Measuring
   the extent of collaboration is challenging due to the variety of
   collaboration mechanisms and the degree to which organizations report on
   their interactions. The space sector also has specificities that call
   for a distinct methodology: the culture of secrecy, publication
   practices, the competitive advantage of certain collaborations, the
   limited funding available, and so on. This article will present a
   methodology for studying collaborations in the Canadian space sector
   using bibliometric data, surveys, and publicly available CSA contract
   data. Mapping these datasets will help identify the extent of
   interinstitutional collaborations, cross-fertilization between
   terrestrial and space research, and the impact of CSA funding on
   research outputs. Results from three case studies will be presented:
   Space Medicine and Life Sciences, Space Robotics and Rovers, and Earth
   Observation. Impact measurements not only play an important role in
   justifying stakeholders' investments, but also help clarify the
   innovation patterns and efficiency of the various mechanisms used.}},

Abstract = {{An improvement to the probabilistic discrete cracking model for
   fibre-reinforced concretes, originally developed by Rossi, is proposed
   in this paper.
   This new model features the following:
   Crack formation and propagation in the concrete is taken into account by
   using special interface elements. These elements open once the normal
   tensile stress at their centre of gravity reaches the tensile strength
   of the element. The probabilistic aspect of the cracking process is
   taken into account by the fact that the tensile strength is randomly
   distributed throughout the mesh elements.
   Immediately after the formation of cracks, the fibre bridging effect is
   considered by a damage model approach. The probabilistic aspect consists
   of randomly distributing the post-cracking energy.
   The improved numerical model is used to analyse the bending behaviour of
   three SFRC beams made from the same material. The numerical simulations
   are compared with experimental results in terms of the global behaviour
   of and cracking processes in the beams.}},

Abstract = {{There are many ways to generate geometrical models for numerical
   simulation, and most of them start with a segmentation step to extract
   the boundaries of the regions of interest. This paper presents an
   algorithm to generate a patient-specific three-dimensional geometric
   model, based on a tetrahedral mesh, without an initial extraction of
   contours from the volumetric data. Using the information directly
   available in the data, such as gray levels, we built a metric to drive a
   mesh adaptation process. The metric is used to specify the size and
   orientation of the tetrahedral elements everywhere in the mesh. Our
   method, which produces anisotropic meshes, gives good results with
   synthetic and real MRI data. The resulting model quality has been
   evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively by comparing it with an
   analytical solution and with a segmentation made by an expert. Results
   show that our method gives, in 90\% of the cases, as good or better
   meshes as a similar isotropic method, based on the accuracy of the
   volume reconstruction for a given mesh size. Moreover, a comparison of
   the Hausdorff distances between adapted meshes of both methods and
   ground-truth volumes shows that our method decreases reconstruction
   errors faster. Copyright (c) 2015John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{In vivo histology of the myelin g-ratio with magnetic resonance imaging}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{118}},
Pages = {{397-405}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The myelin g-ratio, defined as the ratio between the inner and the outer
   diameter of the myelin sheath, is a fundamental property of white matter
   that can be computed from a simple formula relating the myelin volume
   fraction to the fiber volume fraction or the axon volume fraction. In
   this paper, a unique combination of magnetization transfer, diffusion
   imaging and histology is presented, providing a novel method for in vivo
   magnetic resonance imaging of the axon volume fraction and the myelin
   g-ratio. Our method was demonstrated in the corpus callosum of one
   cynomolgus macaque, and applied to obtain full-brain g-ratio maps in one
   healthy human subject and one multiple sclerosis patient. In the
   macaque, the g-ratio was relatively constant across the corpus callosum,
   as measured by both MRI and electron microscopy. In the human subjects,
   the g-ratio in multiple sclerosis lesions was higher than in normal
   appearing white matter, which was in turn higher than in healthy white
   matter. Measuring the g-ratio brings us one step closer to fully
   characterizing white matter non-invasively, making it possible to
   perform in vivo histology of the human brain during development, aging,
   disease and treatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a generalization of the limited-memory Cholesky factorization
   of Lin and Mor, (SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 21(1), 24-45, 1999) to the
   symmetric indefinite case with special interest in symmetric
   quasi-definite matrices. We use this incomplete factorization to
   precondition two formulations of linear systems arising from regularized
   interior-point methods for quadratic optimization. An advantage of the
   limited-memory approach is predictable memory requirements. We establish
   existence of incomplete factors when the input matrix is an H-matrix but
   our numerical results illustrate that the factorization succeeds more
   generally. An appropriate diagonal shift is applied whenever the input
   matrix is not quasi definite. As the memory parameter increases an
   efficiency measure of the preconditioner suggested by Scott and TA-ma
   (2013) improves. The combination of the 3x3 block formulation analyzed
   by Greif, Moulding, and Orban (SIAM J. Optim. 24(1), 49-83, 2014), the
   SYMAMD ordering, and a moderate memory parameter results in encouraging

Abstract = {{This two-part paper is an application of advanced nonlinear
   finite-element analyses (ANFEA) for the design or assessment of large
   concrete structures. It presents an innovative application of ANFEA that
   reveals many important aspects of numerical modeling and safety
   verification, starting from the material up to the structural level and
   going from calibration and validation to the prediction level. A complex
   hydraulic structure with large members and nonconventional boundary
   conditions is taken as the target design structure (TDS). Following a
   two-step procedure that was proposed in a previous paper, the model
   error is first computed for two candidate concrete models (part 1).
   Using the selected concrete model and the corresponding model error, the
   global resistance factor is computed in a second step for the TDS (part
   2). This first part is related to the calibration and validation
   assessments for the ANFEA models of concrete structures. These issues
   can be viewed as two basic steps within the verification and validation
   process (V\&V) that has been adopted in other engineering fields. In the
   calibration procedure, the size effect phenomenon, which is a major
   parameter for the TDS, is considered. The distinction between size
   effect statistical (material) and deterministic (energetic) components
   is highlighted, and a new approach for considering each contribution is
   presented. The validation process is undertaken from the material to the
   structural level. It is shown through this process that the use of only
   the compressive strength of concrete and the yield stress of
   reinforcement are sufficient with one candidate concrete model in order
   to obtain a relatively low coefficient of variation of model error. The
   paper illustrates a general methodology that can be applied with any
   ANFEA software to design or assess the safety level of unusual concrete
   structures. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{This second-part article presents applications of advanced nonlinear
   finite-element analysis for the design of large reinforced-concrete
   structures. Because shear and the size effect are fundamental aspects of
   these structures, the first section of this paper is devoted to the
   prediction of shear failure for very large members more than 3 m deep.
   It is shown that the tendency of shear strength is much less sensitive
   to size effects for very large members than the predictions of some
   design code equations. Applications to the draft tube complex structure
   are then presented in a second part. A comparison of cracking patterns
   with an existing powerhouse is performed at the service level. It is
   shown that thermal effects have an important effect on the final
   cracking pattern. The draft tube model is then analyzed up to failure.
   Following a new design methodology proposed by the authors in a previous
   paper, and using the model error properties computed in part 1, the
   global resistance factor is computed for the ultimate level. The effects
   of temperature, nominal shear reinforcement, and lateral confinement are
   discussed. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an optimization post-processing module allowing to
   improve and to optimize tool-tip milling operations. Moreover, this
   module verifies and insures milling feasibility of a complex
   three-dimensional shape. During such situations, the tool is in contact
   with the workpiece through a hint located on its ball-end mill. Knowing
   that a relatively large variation of the tool orientation does not
   necessarily change the resulting workpiece geometry, then the
   post-processing module can be formulated as an optimization problem. The
   tool orientation is computed to be as close as possible to our preferred
   orientation together with its joints as far as possible to the joint
   limits and, obviously, subject that the tool-tip is following the
   required trajectory. The module has been implemented for the Huron
   KX8-Five milling center. Several surface shapes have been post-processed
   and verified in simulations with VERICUT, among which four parts have
   effectively been machined. Our optimal module produced a computer-aided
   manufacturing (CAM) program which could then be transferred into a
   machine-tool controller (CNC) milling machine, and this program
   succeeded in machining a complex workpiece which would normally prove
   unfeasible with a classical approach which usually maintains the tool
   normal to the surface without exceeding the joint limits.}},

Abstract = {{During the past decade, melanins and melanogenesis have attracted
   growing interest for a broad range of biomedical and technological
   applications. The burst of polydopamine-based multifunctional coatings
   in materials science is just one example, and the list may be expanded
   to include melanin thin films for organic electronics and
   bioelectronics, drug delivery systems, functional nanoparticles and
   biointerfaces, sunscreens, environmental remediation devices. Despite
   considerable advances, applied research on melanins and melanogenesis is
   still far from being mature. A closer intersectoral interaction between
   research centers is essential to raise the interests and increase the
   awareness of the biomedical, biomaterials science and hi-tech sectors of
   the manifold opportunities offered by pigment cells and related
   metabolic pathways. Starting from a survey of biological roles and
   functions, the present review aims at providing an interdisciplinary
   perspective of melanin pigments and related pathway with a view to
   showing how it is possible to translate current knowledge about physical
   and chemical properties and control mechanisms into new bioinspired
   solutions for biomedical, dermocosmetic, and technological applications.}},

Abstract = {{Adsorption of mixtures of cyanotoxins onto sediment as a dominant
   mechanism in the elimination of cyanotoxins from the aqueous phase has
   not been extensively investigated. The aim of this study was to
   investigate adsorption and desorption behavior of six microcystins
   including microcystin (MC)-LR, RR, YR, LY, LW and LF and
   cylindrospermopsin (CYN) on natural sediment. Freundlich and Langmuir
   isotherms could be fitted for MC-LR, RR, YR and CYN. Sorption kinetics
   showed immediate rapid adsorption for all cyanotoxins: CYN, MCLW and
   MCLF were adsorbed 72.6\%, 56.7\% and 55.3\% respectively within 2 h.
   Results of desorption experiments demonstrated that less than 9\% of
   cyanotoxins desorbed from sediment within 96 h. Adsorption of
   cyanotoxins onto three fractionated sediments particles, clay-silt (<75
   mu m), find sand (75-315 mu m) and coarse sand (315-2000 mu m)
   demonstrated that adsorption capacity of coarse sand fraction for all
   the tested cyanotoxins was less than 4\% of the clay silt fraction.
   Results of this study revealed that there is a potential for cyanotoxins
   to accumulate in the sediments of lakes, as well as in drinking water
   treatment plants. Monitoring programs must consider cyanotoxins in the
   particulate phase to avoid largely underestimating toxin concentrations
   following their release from blooms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a mixed integer linear model for a practical
   multi-facility wood-procurement planning problem using a cut-to-length
   (CTL) bucking system. This forest management problem is difficult to
   solve since it integrates the forest bucking problem and the
   multi-facility supply planning problem. A priority-list approach was
   used to generate adequate bucking patterns in the Eastern Canadian
   context. The model provides decision support with respect to how to
   harvest the different cut-blocks according to the bucking priority list
   used, and in what quantities harvested logs should be transported to
   sawmills. It aims to minimize the nonlinear harvesting cost, the
   transportation cost, and the inventory cost and to maximize the product
   value (i.e., profit maximization). The harvesting cost considers the
   nonlinearity of the harvester productivity function, which is an
   important aspect of the decision-making process in forest management.
   The model was used to compare the current bucking scenario to two new
   possibilities. These scenarios allow us to investigate the gains and
   losses that arise from the use of different bucking aggregations.
   Specifically, we consider the impact on the number of different log
   types per block and thus on the associated harvesting cost. Moreover, we
   aim to better understand the cost/benefit trade-offs of a more complex
   decision structure in a Canadian wood-procurement context. The results
   of our scenario tests showed that forest bucking aggregation (the
   current practice) significantly reduces the company's profit. A simple
   bucking disaggregation that does not increase the operational cost can
   improve the outcome.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present the solution to a weekly log-truck scheduling

   pick-up and delivery requirements, multiple products, inventory levels,

   transportation cost including wait times and the empty and loaded
   distance traveled. Our solution is based on a two-phase approach. The
   first phase involves an integer linear program that determines the
   destinations of full truckloads. The second phase uses an implicit
   integer linear program based on an arc formulation to ensure that the
   trucks are routed and scheduled at a minimum cost. Experiments have been
   conducted using Cplex 12.4.0, and almost all instances were solved
   within six hours with a reasonable gap.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative magnetization transfer imaging (qMTI) increases specificity
   to macromolecular content in tissue by modeling the exchange process
   between the liquid and the macromolecular pool. However, its use has
   been mostly restricted to researchers that have developed these methods,
   in part due to the need to write complicated in-house software for
   modeling and data analysis. We have developed a software package
   (qMTLab) with a simple and easy to use graphical user interface that
   unifies three of the most widely used qMTI methods: MT spoiled gradient
   echo (MT-SPGR), MT balanced steady-state free precession (MT-bSSFP), and
   selective inversion recovery with fast spin echo (SIR-FSE). qMTLab is
   free open-source software that allows anyone interested in using these
   methods to easily simulate qMTI data, compare the performance of the
   methods under various experimental conditions, define new acquisition
   protocols, fit acquired data, and visualize the fitted parameters maps.
   By providing free software that gives end users a simple and easy to use
   graphical interface, we hope to make qMTI accessible to a greater number
   of investigators and facilitate the development, evaluation, and
   optimization of acquisition protocols and models. (C) 2016 Wiley

Title = {{Numerical Analysis of the Stress Distribution in Symmetrical Backfilled
   Trenches with Inclined Walls}},
Journal = {{INDIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{278-290}},

Abstract = {{Backfilled trenches are commonly used for municipal and industrial
   services such as gas, drinking water and sewers. Their design involves
   the determination of the stresses imposed due to the fill material,
   which requires a good understanding of the interaction between the
   backfill and abutment walls. In practice, such stresses (or loads) are
   often estimated using an analytical solution proposed by Marston, based
   on the arching theory with a constant earth pressure coefficient.
   However, a number of influencing factors are neglected when using this
   approach. This paper investigates the effect of key factors on the
   stress distribution in symmetrical backfilled trenches with inclined
   walls, through a series of numerical simulations. The results presented
   here illustrate how the vertical and horizontal stresses distribution is
   affected by the trench geometry, including its width and wall
   inclination, and by the backfill properties. Results from this numerical
   investigation show that the application of the basic Marston's solution
   can lead to a significant underestimation of the stresses, particularly
   in the lower part of a trench. The magnitude of the undervaluation is
   more pronounced when the stiffness contrast between the backfill and
   wall material is small. The simulations further indicate that the earth
   pressure coefficient K varies with depth and wall inclination,
   indicating that using a constant value of K may not be appropriate for
   trenches with inclined walls. A discussion follows on the significance
   and limitations of this work, and on additional factors that can
   influence the stress state in backfilled trenches.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{55}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Response cost evaluation is a major part of the Intrusion Response
   System (IRS). Although many automated IRSs have been proposed, most of
   them use statically evaluated responses, avoiding the need for dynamic
   evaluation of response cost. However, by designing a dynamic evaluation
   for the responses we can alleviate the drawbacks of the static model.
   Furthermore, it will be more effective at defending a system from an
   attack as it will be less predictable. A dynamic model offers the best
   response based on the current situation of the network. Thus, the
   evaluation of the positive effects and negative impacts of the responses
   must be computed online, at attack time, in a dynamic model. We evaluate
   the response cost online with respect to the resources dependencies and
   the number of online users.
   In this paper, we present a practical framework with relevant factors
   for response cost evaluation. The proposed framework is a platform that
   leads us to account for the user's needs in terms of quality of services
   (QoS) and the dependencies of critical processes. Compared with other
   response evaluation models, the proposed framework consists of not only
   a novel online mechanism for response cost evaluation in complex network
   topologies, but also more detailed factors to evaluate responses
   positive effect and negative impact. In addition, we discuss the main
   challenges to evaluate response cost with respect to the attack type.

Abstract = {{Critical evaluations and thermodynamic modeling of the Ag-(Ca, Li, and
   Zn) and Ca-(In, Li) binary systems are presented. Thermodynamic
   optimization of the Ag-Li binary system was carried out in the present
   work at first. Thermodynamic re-optimizations of the Ag-Ca, Ag-Zn, Ca-In
   and Ca-Li binary systems were carried out in the present work, which
   presents improvements in comparison with previous works. The Modified
   Quasichemical Model in the Pair Approximation (MQMPA) was used for the
   liquid solution: this model is particularly suited for liquid which
   exhibits a high degree of short-range order. The intermetallic compounds
   are modeled with the Compound Energy Formalism (CEF), and terminal solid
   solutions are modeled with Bragg-Williams model (BWM) with sub-regular
   solution approximation. All available and reliable experimental data are
   reproduced within experimental error limits. A self-consistent
   thermodynamic database was constructed for the Ag-(Ca, Li, and Zn) and
   Ca-(In, Li) binary systems, which as a part of the thermodynamic
   database of the Mg-X (X: Ag, Ca, In, Li, Na, Sn, Sr, and Zn)
   multi-component system shall facilitate the development of Mg alloys for
   practical industrial purposes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The previously obtained thermodynamic databases for the Cu-Fe-S,
   Cu-Fe-O, Fe-O-S and Cu-O-S ternary systems have been combined and used
   to predict thermodynamic equilibria in the quaternary Cu-Fe-O-S system.
   The available experimental data were compared with model predictions.
   Minor modifications of model parameters were required to better describe
   the experimental points in the quaternary system; the effect of these
   changes was verified in the ternary subsystems. The procedure was
   developed to calculate the isothermal sections of the phase diagram of
   the quaternary system inside the tetrahedron. The liquid phase over the
   whole composition range from metallic liquid to sulfide melt to oxide
   melt has been described by a single model developed within the framework
   of the quasi-chemical formalism. The obtained self-consistent set of
   model parameters can be used as a basis for the development of a
   thermodynamic database for simulation of copper smelting and converting.

Abstract = {{The Rosenblueth point estimator method is used to propagate uncertainty
   on stochastic parameters in a multi-ionic reactive transport model for
   concrete degradation. The degradation mechanism that was analysed is the
   ingress of chlorides into concrete. This point estimator method is used
   because it requires a minimum number of simulations to compute means,
   standard deviations and skewness for the solution of the transport
   model. Two exposure cases are considered in this article: the first is a
   saturated case, and the second is an unsaturated case with wetting (4
   days) and drying (3 days at 50 \% relative humidity) cycles. The sodium
   chloride exposure during the wetting cycle of both cases was 500 mmol/L.
   In both cases, predictions from the model were compared to experimental
   results. The Rosenblueth approach yielded results comparable to Monte
   Carlo simulations for both saturated and unsaturated cases. The relative
   sensitivity of model parameters on prediction results are investigated
   through a sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity results show the high
   importance of ionic diffusion parameters and of exposure conditions,
   while the calculated initial mineral phases in the hydrated paste have
   lower importance.}},

Title = {{The positive edge pricing rule for the dual simplex}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& OPERATIONS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{135-142}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop the two-dimensional positive edge criterion
   for the dual simplex. This work extends a similar pricing rule
   implemented by Towhidi et al. (2014) {[}24] to reduce the negative
   effects of degeneracy in the primal simplex. In the dual simplex,
   degeneracy occurs when nonbasic variables have a zero reduced cost, and
   it may lead to pivots that do not improve the objective value. We
   analyze dual degeneracy to characterize a particular set of dual
   compatible variables such that if any of them is selected to leave the
   basis the pivot will be nondegenerate. The dual positive edge rule can
   be used to modify any pivot selection rule so as to prioritize
   compatible variables. The expected effect is to reduce the number of
   pivots during the solution of degenerate problems with the dual simplex.
   For the experiments, we implement the positive edge rule within the dual
   simplex of the COIN-OR LP solver, and combine it with both the dual
   Dantzig and the dual steepest edge criteria. We test our implementation
   on 62 instances from four well-known benchmarks for linear programming.
   The results show that the dual positive edge rule significantly improves
   on the classical pricing rules. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The improved primal simplex (IPS) was recently developed by Elhalaloui
   et al. to take advantage of degeneracy when solving linear programs with
   the primal simplex. It implements a dynamic constraint reduction based
   on the compatible columns, i.e., those that belong to the span of a
   given subset of basic columns including the nondegenerate ones. The
   identification of the compatible variables may however be
   computationally costly and a large number of linear programs are solved
   to enlarge the subset of basic variables. In this article, we first show
   how the positive edge criterion of Raymond et al. can be included in IPS
   for a fast identification of the compatible variables. Our algorithm
   then proceeds through a series of reduction and augmentation phases
   until optimality is reached. In a reduction phase, we identify
   compatible variables and focus on them to make quick progress toward
   optimality. During an augmentation phase, we compute one greatest
   normalized improving direction and select a subset of variables that
   should be considered in the reduced problem. Compared with IPS, the
   linear program that is solved to find this direction involves the data
   of the original constraint matrix. This new algorithm is tested over
   Mittelmann's benchmark for linear programming and on instances arising
   from industrial applications. The results show that the new algorithm
   outperforms the primal simplex of CPLEX on most highly degenerate
   instances in which a sufficient number of nonbasic variables are
   compatible. In contrast, IPS has difficulties on the eleven largest
   Mittelmann instances. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{114}},
Pages = {{265-276}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a new approach is proposed to estimate the direction of
   arrival (DOA) of multiple non-coherent source signals with known
   waveforms but unknown gains based on a nonuniform linear sensor array.
   Unlike some previous methods, which estimate the DOA using spatial
   signatures of the signals with known waveforms, the proposed method
   first uses the known waveforms and mutually independent sensor
   measurement noises to establish a maximum likelihood estimation problem
   corresponding to multiple linear regression models, each containing the
   DOA and the gain information of all the source signals. Then, regression
   analysis is performed to estimate the coefficients of each linear
   regression model, and the well-known generalized least squares is used
   to obtain the estimates of the angles and gains from the estimated
   regression coefficients. The proposed method does not require a search
   over a large region of the parameter space, which is normally needed in
   ML-based DOA estimation methods. The effect of correlated sources on the
   performance of the parameter estimation is also studied. It is shown
   that the DOA and gain estimates are asymptotically optimal as the
   sources, tend to be uncorrelated. Finally, simulation results that
   demonstrate the estimation performance of the proposed method are given.

Abstract = {{The recent meteoric rise in the use of smartphones and other mobile
   devices has led to a new class of software applications (i.e., mobile
   apps). One reason for this success is the extensive support available to
   mobile app developers through the APIs provided by mobile platforms
   (e.g., Android). In our previous research, we found that mobile apps
   tend to depend highly on these platform-specific APIs. High dependence
   on a particular mobile platform may introduce instability and defects,
   as these mobile platforms are rapidly evolving. Therefore, the extent of
   platform dependence may be an indicator of software quality. In this
   paper, we examine the relationship between platform dependence and
   defect proneness of the source code files of an Android app to determine
   whether software metrics based on platform dependence can be used to
   prioritize software quality assurance efforts. We find that (1) source
   code files that are defect prone have a higher dependence on the
   platform than defect-free files and (2) increasing the platform
   dependence increases the likelihood of a defect being present in a
   source code file. Thus, platform dependence may be used to prioritize
   the most defect-prone source code files for code reviews and unit
   testing by the software quality assurance team.}},

Abstract = {{We have demonstrated field effect tuning of microwave frequency Faraday
   rotation in magnetically biased large-area graphene in a hollow circular
   waveguide isolator geometry. Oxidized intrinsic silicon was used as a

   modulation of isolation in the K-band was achieved with a gate voltage
   modulation of 10V corresponding to a carrier density modulation of 7 x
   10(11)/cm(2). We have developed a simple analytical model for
   transmission and isolation of the structure. Field effect modulation of
   Faraday rotation can be extended to other two dimensional electronic
   systems and is anticipated to be useful for gate voltage controlled
   isolators, circulators, and other non-reciprocal devices. (C) 2015 AIP

Pages = {{6459-6478}},

Abstract = {{The early detection, diagnosis and monitoring of liver cancer
   progression can be achieved with the precise delineation of metastatic
   tumours. However, accurate automated segmentation remains challenging
   due to the presence of noise, inhomogeneity and the high appearance
   variability of malignant tissue. In this paper, we propose an
   unsupervised metastatic liver tumour segmentation framework using a
   machine learning approach based on discriminant Grassmannian manifolds
   which learns the appearance of tumours with respect to normal tissue.
   First, the framework learns within-class and between-class similarity
   distributions from a training set of images to discover the optimal
   manifold discrimination between normal and pathological tissue in the
   liver. Second, a conditional optimisation scheme computes non-local
   pairwise as well as pattern-based clique potentials from the manifold
   subspace to recognise regions with similar labelings and to incorporate
   global consistency in the segmentation process. The proposed framework
   was validated on a clinical database of 43 CT images from patients with
   metastatic liver cancer. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our
   method achieves a better performance on two separate datasets of
   metastatic liver tumours from different clinical sites, yielding an
   overall mean Dice similarity coefficient of 90.7 +/- 2.4 in over 50
   tumours with an average volume of 27.3 mm(3).}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the Multi-Row Facility Layout Problem.
   Given a set of rectangular departments, a fixed number of rows, and
   weights for each pair of departments, the problem consists of finding an
   assignment of departments to rows and the positions of the departments
   in each row so that the total weighted sum of the center-to-center
   distances between all pairs of departments is minimized. We show how to
   extend our recent approach for the Space-Free Multi-Row Facility Layout
   Problem to general Multi-Row Facility Layout as well as some special
   cases thereof. To the best of our knowledge this is the first global
   optimization approach for multi-row layout that is applicable beyond the
   double-row case. A key aspect of our proposed approach is a model for
   multi-row layout that expresses the problem as a discrete optimization
   problem, and thus makes it possible to exploit the underlying
   combinatorial structure. In particular we can explicitly control the
   number and size of the spaces between departments. We construct a
   semidefinite relaxation of the discrete optimization formulation and
   present computational results showing that the proposed approach gives
   promising results for several variants of multi-row layout problems on a
   variety of benchmark instances. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   Applications to automated white matter/gray matter segmentation and
   tensor-based morphometry (TBM) mapping of gray matter alterations

Abstract = {{Recently, a T-2{*}-weighted template and probabilistic atlas of the
   white and gray matter (WM, GM) of the spinal cord (SC) have been
   reported. Such template can be used as tissue-priors for automated WM/GM
   segmentation but can also provide a common reference and normalized
   space for group studies. Here, a new template has been created
   (AMU(40)), and accuracy of automatic template-based WM/GM segmentation
   was quantified. The feasibility of tensor-based morphometry (TBM) for
   studying voxel-wise morphological differences of SC between young and
   elderly healthy volunteers was also investigated.
   Sixty-five healthy subjects were divided into young (n=40, age <40 years
   old, mean age 28 +/- 5 years old) and elderly (n=25, age >50 years old,
   mean age 57 +/- 5 years old) groups and scanned at 3 T using an axial
   high-resolution T-2{*}-weighted sequence. Inhomogeneity correction and
   affine intensity normalization of the SC and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
   signal intensities across slices were performed prior to both
   construction of the AMU(40) template and WM/GM template-based
   segmentation. The segmentation was achieved using non-linear spatial
   normalization of T-2{*}-w MR images to the AMU(40) template. Validation
   of WM/GM segmentations was performed with a leave-one-out procedure by
   calculating DICE similarity coefficients between manual and automated
   WM/GM masks. SC morphological differences between young and elderly
   healthy volunteers were assessed using the same non-linear spatial
   normalization of the subjects' MRI to a common template, derivation of
   the Jacobian determinant maps from the warping fields, and a TBM
   analysis.
   Results demonstrated robust WM/GM automated segmentation, with mean DICE
   values greater than 0.8. Concerning the TBM analysis, an anterior GM
   atrophy was highlighted in elderly volunteers, demonstrating thereby,
   for the first time, the feasibility of studying local structural
   alterations in the SC using tensor-based morphometry. This holds great
   promise for studies of morphological impairment occurring in several
   central nervous system pathologies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{In this study, we present a study of polypropylene/bentonite composites
   where stearic acid was used as both a surface and interface modifier
   during the compounding of composites. The concentration of bentonite was
   1.5, 2.5, 5.0, and 10 parts per hundred. The composites were
   characterized by impact resistance and tensile tests, rheological
   analysis, the dispersion state of the filler observed by optical
   microscopy, and interaction between bentonite and stearic acid, as
   analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. No chemical
   interaction was found between bentonite and stearic acid. Composites
   with modified bentonite and stearic acid used as interface modifiers
   increased the elongation at break; these samples also showed better
   dispersion of the filler in comparison with the other compounds. In
   addition, stearic acid acted as a lubricant, favoring the interaction of
   the polymer with the filler and decreasing the viscosity of the
   compounds. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2015,

   reviewed and adopted, and critical thermodynamic evaluations and
   optimizations were later performed on the unavailable AgCl-KCl and
   InCl3-KCl systems in terms of the required phase equilibria and
   thermochemical data from experimental measurements and theoretical
   predictions (First-principles method and empirical equation). The
   Modified Quasi-Chemical model were applied to describing the molten salt
   phase, while all the intermediate phases were treated as the
   stoichiometric compounds due to no observation of the homogeneity
   composition range. Various phase equilibria and thermodynamic properties
   in the ternary and quaternary systems could be facilely calculated based
   upon the ultimate thermodynamic database established in this case, which
   will support beneficial instructions in the related industrial

Journal = {{PLASMA SOURCES SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{A specially designed dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) cell and
   associated equipment has been used to carry out precise measurements of
   electrical energy, E-g, dissipated per discharge cycle of the applied ac
   voltage, V-a over the frequency range 5 <= f <= 50 kHz. Twin pairs of
   several different dielectric materials (2.54 cm diameter discs,
   thicknesses = 2.0 or ca. 0.1 mm) with relative permittivities between
   2.1 <= K' <= 9.5 were used as dielectric barriers in DBDs of four
   different gases: He, Ne, Ar and N-2. Much of the work relates to the
   study of atmospheric pressure glow discharge (APGD) plasma in flowing He
   gas; five separate thermometers (including fiber-optic probes immune to
   high voltage and high-frequency electromagnetic fields) have enabled us
   to perform a detailed calorimetric (heat balance) investigation in He
   APGD, believed to be the first of its kind. Fair agreement in the
   overall energy balance, which includes vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) light
   emission, lends strong support to the validity of both measurements and
   methodology. The latter includes refined algorithms that permit rapid
   data acquisition and processing. The present results are compared with
   literature, allowing several important conclusions/recommendations to
   emerge.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIFURCATION AND CHAOS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The two-dimensional numerical simulation of the flow over a cylinder
   forced to oscillate in the streamwise direction for Re = 200 is
   performed in CFX ANSYS. The controlled-vibration comprises of prescribed
   inline vibration from displacement amplitude-to-cylinder diameter A/D =
   0.05 up to 0.5 with the excitation frequency ratios of 1, 1.5 and 2
   including the harmonic and superharmonic excitation regions. The
   immersed boundary method is used to model the cylinder oscillation.
   Modal decomposition of the transverse velocity field via the proper
   orthogonal decomposition (POD) method is applied to uncover the
   interaction of symmetric and antisymmetric modes of the near wake. A
   model using the first two POD modes is developed based on symmetry group
   equivariance. The model predicts the mode interactions and bifurcated
   solution branches for all cases, and is shown to be in good agreement
   with numerical as well as previous experimental results. Lock-on is
   determined for a range of values of the oscillation amplitudes and
   frequency ratios. It is shown that the lock-on range widens with
   increasing nondimensional oscillation amplitude. The asymmetric 2S, P +
   S and symmetric pattern S with symbol S for a single vortex and P for a
   vortex pair shed per cycle, as well as a regime in which vortex
   formation is not synchronized with cylinder motion are observed in the
   cylinder wake depending on the combination of oscillation amplitude and
   frequency ratio. The frequency ratio variation from 1 to 2 leads to the
   switching from asymmetric to symmetric modes. The symmetric flow pattern
   corresponds to a near zero lift coefficient on the cylinder.}},

Title = {{A self-consistent model for estimating the critical current of
   superconducting devices}},
Journal = {{SUPERCONDUCTOR SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Nowadays, there is growing interest in using superconducting wires or
   tapes for the design and manufacture of devices such as cables, coils,
   rotating machinery, transformers, and fault current limiters, among
   others. Their high current capacity has made them the candidates of
   choice for manufacturing compact and light cables and coils that can be
   used in the large-scale power applications described above. However, the
   performance of these cables and coils is limited by their critical
   current, which is determined by several factors, including the
   conductor's material properties and the geometric layout of the device
   itself. In this work we present a self-consistent model for estimating
   the critical current of superconducting devices. This is of large
   importance when the operating conditions are such that the self-field
   produced by the current is a significant fraction of the total field.
   The model is based on the asymptotic limit when time approaches infinity
   of Faraday's equation written in terms of the magnetic vector potential.
   It uses a continuous E-J relationship and takes the angular dependence
   of the critical current density on the magnetic flux density into
   account. The proposed model is used to estimate the critical current of
   superconducting devices such as cables, coils, and coils made of
   transposed cables with very high accuracy. The high computing speed of
   this model makes it an ideal candidate for design optimization.}},

Title = {{Direct oriented growth of armchair graphene nanoribbons on germanium}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Graphene can be transformed from a semimetal into a semiconductor if it
   is confined into nanoribbons narrower than 10nm with controlled
   crystallographic orientation and well-defined armchair edges. However,
   the scalable synthesis of nanoribbons with this precision directly on
   insulating or semiconducting substrates has not been possible. Here we
   demonstrate the synthesis of graphene nanoribbons on Ge(001) via
   chemical vapour deposition. The nanoribbons are self-aligning 3 degrees
   from the Ge < 110 > directions, are self-defining with predominantly
   smooth armchair edges, and have tunable width to <10 nm and aspect ratio
   to >70. In order to realize highly anisotropic ribbons, it is critical
   to operate in a regime in which the growth rate in the width direction
   is especially slow, <5 nm h(-1). This directional and anisotropic growth
   enables nanoribbon fabrication directly on conventional semiconductor
   wafer platforms and, therefore, promises to allow the integration of
   nanoribbons into future hybrid integrated circuits.}},

Title = {{Shedding light on the effect of priority instructions during dual-task

Journal = {{BRAIN AND COGNITION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{1-14}},

Abstract = {{Age-related differences in the ability to perform two tasks
   simultaneously (or dual-task) have become a major concern in aging
   neurosciences and have often been assessed with two distinct paradigms;
   the Psychological Refractory Period (PRP) and the Dual-Task (DT)
   paradigms. PRP studies assess participants when they give Priority to
   one task over the other (complete A then B), whereas in DT studies
   participants give Equal priority to both tasks (complete A and B). The
   Equal condition could be viewed as adding an executive control component
   to the task since the participants must spontaneously monitor attention
   between tasks. In the current study, we assessed the effect of priority
   instructions (Priority vs. Equal) on the dual-task performance and brain
   activity of younger (n = 16) and older adults (n = 19) with functional
   near infra-red spectroscopy (fNIRS). In younger adults, the Priority
   condition showed right-sided activation in the prefrontal cortex during
   DT execution. Older adults showed bilateral frontal activation, yet
   restrained to specific areas. They showed increased activation in DT vs.
   single task condition in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)
   and the bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC). In the Equal
   condition, the DT condition showed isolated left DLPFC and VLPFC
   activation in younger adults and widespread bilateral DLPFC activation
   in older adults. These results suggest that for both older and younger
   adults, priority effects are associated with distinct patterns of
   prefrontal activation. Age-related differences also exist in these
   patterns such that prefrontal activation seems to be more spread out at
   different sites in older adults when they are instructed to give Equal
   priority to both tasks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Internet traffic monitoring is an increasingly challenging task because
   of the high bandwidths, especially at Internet Service Provider routers
   and/or Internet backbones. We propose a parallel implementation of the
   max-hashing algorithm that enables the detection of millions of
   referenced files by deep packet inspection over high bandwidth
   connections. We also propose a method to extract high-entropy signatures
   from MP4 files compatible with the max-hashing algorithm in order to
   have low false positive rates. The system first computes a set of
   fingerprints, which are small subsets of the referenced files a priori
   unique and easily identifiable. At detection time, the max-hashing
   algorithm eliminates the need to reconstruct the flows. A Graphics
   Processing Unit (CPU) card computes the fingerprints of all the IP
   packets in parallel and searches for hits in the onboard collection of
   fingerprints. Our application, dedicated to the detection of known MP4
   video files, enables the detection of millions of fingerprints and
   demonstrates a sustained processing rate of 50 Gbps per card.
   Furthermore, a null false positive rate was observed for our 28.25 GB
   transfer test. The proposed implementation also features the detection
   of suspect flows based on IP addresses and ports in order to carry out
   deeper investigations off line. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Chain architecture is an influential parameter in melt processing of

   structures were prepared by twin screw extruder. In another series of
   blending, poly(D-lactide) of these branched structures were used to
   obtain stereocomplex crystal. Operating window of blends were determined
   in a series of film blowing process experiments with different blow up
   and take up ratio and results were compared to linear PLA as a
   reference. Moreover, different characterization techniques were applied
   to determine the properties of produced films. It was found that
   addition of branched architecture and presence of stereocomplex in a

Title = {{Comparison of trunk muscle forces, spinal loads and stability estimated
   by one stability- and three EMG-assisted optimization approaches}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL ENGINEERING \& PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{792-800}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Various hybrid EMG-assisted optimization (EMGAO) approaches are commonly
   used to estimate muscle forces and joint loads of human musculoskeletal
   systems. Use of EMG data and optimization enables the EMGAO models to
   account for inter- and intra-individual variations in muscle
   recruitments while satisfying equilibrium requirements. Due to
   implications in ergonomics/prevention and rehabilitation/treatment
   managements of low-back disorders, there is a need to evaluate existing
   approaches. The present study aimed to compare predictions of three
   different EMGAO and one stability-based optimization (OPT) approaches
   for trunk muscle forces, spinal loads, and stability. Identical measured
   kinematics/EMG data and anatomical model were used in all approaches
   when simulating several sagittally symmetric static activities. Results
   indicated substantial inter-model differences in predicted muscle forces
   (up to 123\% and 90\% for total muscle forces in tasks with upright and
   flexed postures, respectively) and spinal loads (up to 74\% and 78\% for
   compression loads in upright and flexed postures, respectively). Results
   of EMGAO models markedly varied depending on the manner in which
   correction (gain) factors were introduced. Large range of gain values
   (from similar to 0.47 to 41) was estimated in each model. While EMGAO
   methods predicted an unstable spine for some tasks, OPT predicted, as
   intended, either a meta-stable or stable states in all simulated tasks.
   An unrealistic unstable state of the spine predicted by EMGAO methods
   for some of the simulated tasks (which are in reality stable) could be
   an indication of the shortcoming of these models in proper prediction of
   muscle forces. (C) 2015 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Development of new polyimide formulas has led to an increase of the use
   of polymer matrix composites by the aerospace industry in critical
   applications such as aircraft engines. In such an extreme environment,
   the polymer matrix is likely to exhibit a viscoelastic behavior due to
   the elevated temperatures. Furthermore, physical ageing is likely to
   appear during the service life of the material. In order for engineers
   to design with such materials, constitutive theories able to take into
   account those effects, must be developed. This paper deals with the
   mechanical behavior of a new polyimide matrix tested under complex
   thermo-mechanical histories while accounting for physical ageing. The
   experimental data obtained was modeled with a newly developed
   constitutive theory stemming from Schapery's thermodynamical framework.
   The model parameters were obtained from creep-recovery data under
   various temperatures, ageing times, and loads. The model was
   subsequently validated against independent complex thermo-mechanical
   histories. An excellent agreement between the experiments and the
   predictions has been obtained.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this work was to theoretically evaluate the relevance of
   using homogeneous biphasic models to represent the mechanical behavior
   of the growth plate. To that end, representative volume elements (RVEs)
   of reserve and proliferative zones, where the extracellular matrix was
   modeled as poroelastic and the chondrocytes were assumed to be isotropic
   and linearly elastic, were meshed by finite elements. The matrix obeyed
   either the biphasic poroelastic (BPE) or the transversely isotropic
   biphasic poroelastic (TIBPE) models. The RVEs were submitted to
   unconfined compression (UC), confined compression (CC) and to a hybrid
   loading featuring a prescribed pore pressure. The overall responses of
   the RVEs to UC and CC were fit by either the BPE or the TIBPE models.
   The study revealed that the BPE model was unable to predict the
   responses under UC and CC simultaneously for both modeled zones. The
   TIBPE model fit with good accuracy the RVEs effective responses under UC
   and CC, but failed to predict the response of the hybrid loading. These
   results show that a mixture of poroelastic phases does not lead to an
   overall behavior that can be fit with the same formulation. Moreover,
   this study exemplified the fact the even if the TIBPE model fits
   experimental data under UC and CC due to its increased number of
   parameters, it can fail to predict other loading cases. This motivates
   further micromechanical studies where the local behavior of the
   constituent phases would carefully be evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new tool wear monitoring and alarm system that is
   based on logical analysis of data (LAD). LAD is a data-driven
   combinatorial optimization technique for knowledge discovery and pattern
   recognition. The system is a nonintrusive online device that measures
   the cutting forces and relates them to tool wear through learned
   patterns. It is developed during turning titanium metal matrix
   composites (TiMMCs). These are a new generation of materials which have
   proven to be viable in various industrial fields such as biomedical and
   aerospace. Since they are quite expensive, our objective is to increase
   the tool life by giving an alarm at the right moment. The proposed
   monitoring system is tested by using the experimental results obtained
   under sequential different machining conditions. External and internal
   factors that affect the turning process are taken into consideration.
   The system's alarm limit is validated and is compared to the limit
   obtained when the statistical proportional hazards model (PHM) is used.
   The results show that the proposed system that is based on using LAD
   detects the worn patterns and gives a more accurate alarm for cutting
   tool replacement.}},

Abstract = {{Analytical models are proposed to predict the compressive resistance of
   discontinuous bracing members in steel X-braced frames when governed by
   flexure of the connecting plates at the mid-connections. The connections
   are bolted single shear splice connections commonly used for HSS bracing
   members. An incremental analysis procedure is developed to predict the
   axial load-deformation response of the brace-connection assembly
   including geometric and material nonlinearities. The buckling strength
   depends on the thickness of the connecting plates, the length of the
   connection, the clear distance between the continuous and discontinuous
   bracing members at the brace intersection, and the length of the
   discontinuous brace segments. The method is validated against test
   results from full-scale X-bracing specimens. It is also used to verify
   the design procedure proposed in the AISC Design Guide 24 for Hollow
   Structural Section Connections for a series of 17 X-braces covering a
   wide range of properties. The AISC design procedure generally
   over-predicts the buckling resistance. A new design procedure is

Title = {{Design, Testing, and Detailed Component Modeling of a High-Capacity
   Self-Centering Energy-Dissipative Brace}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The self-centering energy-dissipative (SCED) brace is an innovative
   cross brace for buildings that provides a nonlinear response with good
   energy dissipation and postyield stiffness while minimizing residual
   drift after an earthquake. This provides a high level of seismic
   performance by allowing structures to remain operational even after
   major seismic events. Recently, the SCED brace has been improved through
   the design and experimental evaluation of a high-capacity SCED (HC-SCED)
   that has an axial capacity similar to some of the largest available
   conventional cross braces for buildings. This prototype HC-SCED
   satisfied testing protocols for buckling-restrained braces and exhibited
   full self-centering behavior during cycles up to 1.5\% drift. To
   characterize the hysteretic response of the brace in detail, a new
   analytical approach is developed. This new approach is necessary because
   simplified stiffness estimates do not provide good predictions of the
   low-amplitude displacement response and initial effective stiffness that
   was measured in the full-scale experiments. The proposed analytical
   approach includes the effects of fabrication tolerances, which have been
   identified as the main reason for incorrect low-amplitude displacement
   predictions that result from the simplified stiffness estimates. Using
   the results from the HC-SCED tests, the new analytical approach provided
   good estimates of the initial stiffness of the braces and also was able
   to predict the behavior of the brace well under a larger fabrication
   tolerance scenario. These improved predictions may be used to improve
   the characterization of the effective hysteretic behavior of actual SCED
   braces for use in nonlinear time history analyses. (C) 2014 American

Abstract = {{Position independent geometric errors (PIGEs), which are caused by
   imperfect assembly of five-axis machine tools, need to be identified and
   compensated to improve the accuracy of machined parts. This paper
   presents the identification and correction of serial five-axis machine
   tools based on screw theory. The proposed identification model is based
   on a generalized Jacobian function for a variety of five-axis machine
   configurations as opposed to the models based on homogeneous
   transformation matrices (HTMs). The screw theory allows a global
   description of rigid body motion without constructing the local frames
   on each drive module as required by the HTMs method. An explicit inverse
   kinematics model is proposed to compensate the geometric errors directly
   as opposed to the existing approximate linearized or iterative methods.
   The proposed identification and correction of PIGEs methods are verified
   through simulations and experiments with ball-bar tests on a five-axis
   machine tool. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Complete penetration magnetic field BP is a feature of a superconducting
   sample submitted to an applied magnetic field. It is very important to
   know this for applications such as an electrical motor or levitation.
   The electric E-J characteristics of a high-temperature superconductor
   (HTS) bulk is generally described by a power law. The main purpose of
   this paper is to investigate the influence of the n-value and the
   applied magnetic field rise rate V-b on the BP of a cylindrical HTS
   pellet. The numerical results presented come from the resolution of a
   nonlinear diffusion problem with commercial software. In this paper,
   cylindrical HTS pellets are submitted to an axial applied magnetic
   field. With the help of these simulations, a linear relationship between
   BP, Vb, and the n-value has been found. A comparison between
   measurements and simulations is done for the magnetization of
   cylindrical bulk superconducting samples. This comparison allows to
   determine the critical current density C-J and n-value of the power
   lawE(J) = E-C(J / J(C)) n. The experiment is based on the direct
   measurement of the local magnetic field in the gap between two bulk HTS
   pellets. The field penetration measurements have been carried out on HTS
   pellets at 77 K by applying increasing magnetic fields with a
   quasi-constant sweep rate for the axial direction of the applied
   magnetic field. Two values of complete penetration magnetic field BP
   have been measured at two different rise rates V-b. The n-value of the
   real HTS pellet has been deduced.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, modelling hysteresis losses in superconductors is most often
   based on the H-formulation of the eddy current model (ECM) solved using
   the finite element method (FEM). In the H-formulation, the problem is
   expressed using the magnetic field intensity H and discretized using
   edge elements in the whole domain. Even though this approach is well
   established, it uses unnecessary degrees of freedom (DOFs) and
   introduces modelling error such as currents flowing in air regions due
   to finite air resistivity. In this paper, we present a modelling tool
   utilizing another H-oriented formulation of the ECM, making use of
   cohomology of the air regions. We constrain the net currents through the
   conductors by fixing the DOFs related to the so-called cohomology basis
   functions. As air regions will be truly non-conducting, DOFs and running
   times of these nonlinear simulations are reduced significantly as
   compared to the classical H-formulation. This fact is demonstrated
   through numerical simulations.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we address a real life optimization problem, the rail
   track inspection scheduling problem. This problem consists of scheduling
   railway network inspection tasks. The objective is to minimize the total
   deadhead distance while performing all inspection tasks. Different 0-1
   integer formulations for the problem are presented. A heuristic based on
   both Benders and Dantzig-Wolfe decompositions is proposed to solve this
   rich arc routing problem. Its performance is analyzed on a real life
   dataset provided by the French national railway company. The proposed
   algorithm is compared to a dynamic programming-based heuristic. Its
   ability to schedule the inspection tasks of 1 year on a sparse graph
   with thousand nodes and arcs is assessed. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals,

   defined to evaluate the workspaces of the robot. Using these indices,
   the robot is subsequently optimized. Finally, the performance of the
   optimized differentially driven robot is compared with fully actuated

Title = {{Collaborative part-based tracking using salient local predictors}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Pages = {{88-101}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This work proposes a novel part-based method for visual object tracking.
   In our model, keypoints are considered as elementary predictors
   localizing the target in a collaborative search strategy. While numerous
   methods have been proposed in the model-free tracking literature,
   finding the most relevant features to track remains a challenging
   problem. To distinguish reliable features from outliers and bad
   predictors, we evaluate feature saliency comprising three factors: the
   persistence, the spatial consistency, and the predictive power of a
   local feature. Saliency information is learned during tracking to be
   exploited in several algorithm components: local prediction, global
   localization, model update, and scale change estimation. By encoding the
   object structure via the spatial layout of the most salient features,
   the proposed method is able to accomplish successful tracking in
   difficult real life situations such as long-term occlusion, presence of
   distractors, and background clutter. The proposed method shows its
   robustness on challenging public video sequences, outperforming
   significantly recent state-of-the-art trackers. Our Salient
   Collaborating Features Tracker (SCFT) also demonstrated a high accuracy
   even if a few local features are available. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Software frameworks keep evolving. It is often time-consuming for
   developers to keep their client code up-to-date. Not all frameworks have
   documentation about the upgrading process. Many approaches have been
   proposed to ease the impact of non-documented framework evolution on
   developers by identifying change rules between two releases of a
   framework, but these change rules are imperfect, i.e., not 100 \%
   correct. To the best of our knowledge, there is no empirical study to
   show the usefulness of these imperfect change rules. Therefore, we
   design and conduct an experiment to evaluate their impact. In the
   experiment, the subjects must find the replacements of 21 missing
   methods in the new releases of three open-source frameworks with the
   help of (1) all-correct, (2) imperfect, and (3) no change rules. The
   statistical analysis results show that the precision of the replacements
   found by the subjects with the three sets of change rules are
   significantly different. The precision with all-correct change rules is
   the highest while that with no change rules is the lowest, while
   imperfect change rules give a precision in between. The effect size of
   the difference between the subjects with no and imperfect change rules
   is large and that between the subjects with imperfect and correct change
   rules is moderate. The results of this study show that the change rules
   generated by framework API evolution approaches do help developers, even
   they are not always correct. The imperfect change rules can be used by
   developers upgrading their code when documentation is not available or
   as a complement to partial documentation. The moderate difference
   between results from subjects with imperfect and all-correct change
   rules also suggests that improving precision of change rules will still
   help developers.}},

Abstract = {{The volume-averaged Navier-Stokes (VANS) equations are at the basis of
   numerous models used to investigate flows in porous media or systems
   containing multiple phases, one of which is made of solid particles.
   Although they are traditionally solved using the finite volume, finite
   difference or finite element method, the lattice Boltzmann method is an
   interesting alternative solver for these equations since it is explicit
   and highly parallelizable. In this work, we first show that the most
   common implementation of the VANS equations in the LBM, based on a
   redefined collision operator, is not valid in the case of spatially
   varying void fractions. This is illustrated through five test cases
   designed using the so-called method of manufactured solutions. We then
   present an LBM scheme for these equations based on a novel collision
   operator. Using the Chapman-Enskog expansion and the same five test
   cases, we show that this scheme is second-order accurate, explicit and
   stable for large void fraction gradients. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{154-159}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In order to observe the influence of strontium (Sr) modification and hot
   isostatic pressing (HIP) on an aluminum-silicon cast alloy A357
   (AlSi7Mg0.6), the microstructure and the high cycle fatigue behavior of
   three batches of materials produced by investment casting (IC) were
   studied. The parts were produced by an advanced IC proprietary process.
   The main process innovation is to increase the solidification and
   cooling rate by immersing the mold in cool liquid. Its advantage is to
   produce finer microstructures. Microstructural characterization showed a
   dendrite arm spacing (DAS) refinement of 40\% when compared with the
   same part produced by conventional investment casting. Fatigue tests
   were conducted on hourglass specimens heat treated to T6, under a stress
   ratio of R = 0.1 and a frequency of 25 Hz. One batch of material was
   unmodified but two batches were modified with 0.007\% and 0.013\% Sr
   addition, from which one batch was submitted to HIP after casting.
   Results reported in S-N diagrams show that the addition of Sr and the
   HIP process improve the 106 cycles fatigue strength by 9\% and 34\%
   respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation of the
   fracture surfaces showed a variety of crack initiation mechanisms. In
   the unmodified alloy, decohesion between the coarse Si particles and the
   aluminum matrix was mostly observed. On the other hand, in the modified
   but non HIP-ed alloy, cracks initiated from pores. When the same alloy
   was subjected to HIP, a competition between crystallographic crack
   initiations (at persistent slip bands) and decohesion/failure of
   intermetallic phases was observed. When compared to fatigue strength
   reported for components produced by permanent mold casting, the studied
   material are more resistant to fatigue even in the unmodified and non
   HIP-ed states. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is a common knee joint
   injury with higher prevalence in female athletes. In search of
   contributing mechanisms, clinical imaging studies of ACL-injured
   individuals versus controls have found greater medial-lateral posterior
   tibial slope (PTS) in injured population irrespective of the sex and in
   females compared to males, with stronger evidence on the lateral plateau
   slope. To quantify these effects, we use a lower extremity
   musculoskeletal model including a detailed finite element (FE) model of
   the knee joint to compute the role of changes in medial and/or lateral
   PTS by +/- 5 degrees and +/- 10 degrees on knee joint biomechanics, in
   general, and ACL force, in particular, throughout the stance phase of
   gait. The model is driven by reported kinematics/kinetics of gait in
   asymptomatic subjects. Our predictions showed, at all stance periods, a
   substantial increase in the anterior tibial translation (ATT) and ACL
   force as PTS increased with reverse trends as PTS decreased. At
   mid-stance, for example, ACL force increased from 181 N to 317 N and 460
   N as PTS increased by 5 degrees and 10 degrees, respectively, while
   dropped to 102 N and 0 N as PTS changed by -5 degrees and -10 degrees,
   respectively. These effects are caused primarily by change in PTS at the
   tibial plateau that carries a larger portion of joint contact force.
   Steeper PTS is a major risk factor, especially under activities with
   large compression, in markedly increasing ACL force and its
   vulnerability to injury. Rehabilitation and ACL injury prevention
   programs could benefit from these findings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The electrical characteristics of a solar thermoelectric generator
   (STEC) are measured. The STEG device is novel in that it requires no
   external pumps such as a water refrigeration unit to maintain a thermal
   differential. The heat source is simulated solar radiation heating a
   double walled evacuated tube. The heat sink is a CPU cooler subjected to
   simulated wind energy. The peak power performance of the STEG for a
   fixed heat input and a varying forced convection brought upon by the
   artificial wind is reported. The STEG's thermoelectric power output
   under naturally occurring solar and wind energy is also reported. A
   discussion on the thermoelectric effect presents experimental results
   showing the effect of varying the circuit's load resistance on a Bi2Te3
   module's electromotive force, electrical resistance, and thermal
   resistivity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A self-consistent optimization of multicomponent solution properties: Ab
   initio molecular dynamic simulations and the MgO-SiO2 miscibility gap
   under pressure}},
Journal = {{GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{161}},
Pages = {{146-165}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{We propose a new approach to parameterizing the Gibbs energy of a
   multicomponent solution as a function of temperature, pressure and
   composition. It uses the quasichemical model in the second nearest
   neighbor approximation and considers both a polynomial representation
   (for low pressure) and an exponential decay representation (for
   moderate-to-high pressure) of the excess molar volume nu(xs) to extend
   thermodynamic behavior to elevated pressure. This approach differs from
   previous configuration-independent regular or associated solution-type
   models of multicomponent silicate liquids at elevated pressure and can
   account for any structural or short-range order data that may be
   available. A simultaneous least squares fit of the molar volume and the
   molar enthalpy of mixing data obtained from First Principles Molecular
   Dynamics (FPMD) simulations at various pressures enables complete
   parameterization of the excess thermodynamic properties of the solution.
   Together with consistently optimized properties of coexisting solids,
   this enables prediction of pressure-temperature-composition phase
   diagrams associated with melting. Although the method is extensible to
   natural multicomponent systems, we apply the procedure as a first test
   case to the important planetary model system MgO-SiO2 using FPMD data
   found in the literature. One key result of this optimization, which
   depends only on the derived excess properties of the liquid phase, is
   that the consolute temperature of the SiO2-rich miscibility gap is
   predicted to decrease with increasing pressure. This appears to be in
   disagreement with available experimental constraints and suggests
   possible thermodynamic inconsistency between FPMD data and experimental
   phase equilibrium data in the 0-5 GPa pressure range. We propose a new
   thermodynamic consistency criterion relating the signs of v(xs) and
   other excess properties and discuss the need for precise calculations of
   derivatives of excess properties. Finally, the potential reappearance of
   the miscibility gap in the MgO-SiO2 system above 5 GPa is discussed in
   light of this work. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Two-Aperture Microfluidic Probes as Flow Dipole: Theory and Applications}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUL 14}},
Abstract = {{A microfluidic probe (MFP) is a mobile channel-less microfluidic system
   under which a fluid is injected from an aperture into an open space,
   hydrodynamically confined by a surrounding fluid, and entirely
   re-aspirated into a second aperture. Various MFPs have been developed,
   and have been used for applications ranging from surface patterning of
   photoresists to local perfusion of organotypic tissue slices. However,
   the hydrodynamic and mass transfer properties of the flow under the MFP
   have not been analyzed, and the flow parameters are adjusted
   empirically. Here, we present an analytical model describing the key
   transport properties in MFP operation, including the dimensions of the
   hydrodynamic flow confinement (HFC) area, diffusion broadening, and
   shear stress as a function of: (i) probe geometry (ii)
   aspiration-to-injection flow rate ratio (iii) gap between MFP and
   substrate and (iv) reagent diffusivity. Analytical results and scaling
   laws were validated against numerical simulations and experimental
   results from published data. These results will be useful to guide
   future MFP design and operation, notably to control the MFP ``brush
   stroke{''} while preserving shear-sensitive cells and tissues.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},

Volume = {{115}},

Month = {{JUL 13}},
Abstract = {{Although only a handful of organic materials have shown polariton
   condensation, their study is rapidly becoming more accessible. The
   spontaneous appearance of long-range spatial coherence is often
   recognized as a defining feature of such condensates. In this Letter, we
   study the emergence of spatial coherence in an organic microcavity and
   demonstrate a number of unique features stemming from the peculiarities
   of this material set. Despite its disordered nature, we find that
   correlations extend over the entire spot size, and we measure g((1))(r,
   r') values of nearly unity at short distances and of 50\% for points
   separated by nearly 10 mu m. We show that for large spots, strong
   shot-to-shot fluctuations emerge as varying phase gradients and defects,
   including the spontaneous formation of vortices. These are consistent
   with the presence of modulation instabilities. Furthermore, we find that
   measurements with flat-top spots are significantly influenced by
   disorder and can, in some cases, lead to the formation of mutually
   incoherent localized condensates.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of bGPUMCD, a Monte
   Carlo algorithm executed on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), for fast
   dose calculations in permanent prostate implant dosimetry. It also aimed
   to validate a low dose rate brachytherapy source in terms of TG-43
   metrics and to use this source to compute dose distributions for
   permanent prostate implant in very short times.
   The physics of bGPUMCD was reviewed and extended to include Rayleigh
   scattering and fluorescence from photoelectric interactions for all
   materials involved. The radial and anisotropy functions were obtained
   for the Nucletron SelectSeed in TG-43 conditions. These functions were
   compared to those found in the MD Anderson Imaging and Radiation
   Oncology Core brachytherapy source registry which are considered the
   TG-43 reference values. After appropriate calibration of the source,
   permanent prostate implant dose distributions were calculated for four
   patients and compared to an already validated Geant4 algorithm.
   The radial function calculated from bGPUMCD showed excellent agreement
   (differences within 1.3\%) with TG-43 accepted values. The anisotropy
   functions at r = 1 cm and r = 4 cm were within 2\% of TG-43 values for
   angles over 17.5 degrees. For permanent prostate implants, Monte
   Carlo-based dose distributions with a statistical uncertainty of 1\% or
   less for the target volume were obtained in 30 s or less for 1 x 1 x 1
   mm(3) calculation grids. Dosimetric indices were very similar (within
   2.7\%) to those obtained with a validated, independent Monte Carlo code
   (Geant4) performing the calculations for the same cases in a much longer
   time (tens of minutes to more than a hour).
   bGPUMCD is a promising code that lets envision the use of Monte Carlo
   techniques in a clinical environment, with sub-minute execution times on
   a standard workstation. Future work will explore the use of this code
   with an inverse planning method to provide a complete Monte Carlo-based
   planning solution.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of numerical errors
   caused by the floating point representation of real numbers in a
   GPU-based Monte Carlo code used for dose calculation in radiation
   oncology, and to identify situations where this type of error arises.
   The program used as a benchmark was bGPUMCD. Three tests were performed
   on the code, which was divided into three functional components: energy
   accumulation, particle tracking and physical interactions. First, the
   impact of single-precision calculations was assessed for each functional
   component. Second, a GPU-specific compilation option that reduces
   execution time as well as precision was examined. Third, a specific
   function used for tracking and potentially more sensitive to precision
   errors was tested by comparing it to a very high-precision
   implementation.
   Numerical errors were found in two components of the program. Because of
   the energy accumulation process, a few voxels surrounding a radiation
   source end up with a lower computed dose than they should. The tracking
   system contained a series of operations that abnormally amplify rounding
   errors in some situations. This resulted in some rare instances (less
   than 0.1\%) of computed distances that are exceedingly far from what
   they should have been. Most errors detected had no significant effects
   on the result of a simulation due to its random nature, either because
   they cancel each other out or because they only affect a small fraction
   of particles. The results of this work can be extended to other types of
   GPU-based programs and be used as guidelines to avoid numerical errors
   on the GPU computing platform.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an approach to develop high-order, temporally
   accurate, finite element approximations of fluid-structure interaction
   (FSI) problems. The proposed numerical method uses an implicit
   monolithic formulation in which the same implicit Runge-Kutta (IRK)
   temporal integrator is used for the incompressible flow, the structural
   equations undergoing large displacements, and the coupling terms at the
   fluid-solid interface. In this context of stiff interaction problems,
   the fully implicit one-step approach presented is an original
   alternative to traditional multistep or explicit one-step finite element
   approaches. The numerical scheme takes advantage of an arbitrary
   Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation of the equations designed to satisfy the
   geometric conservation law and to guarantee that the high-order temporal
   accuracy of the IRK time integrators observed on fixed meshes is
   preserved on arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian deforming meshes. A thorough
   review of the literature reveals that in most previous works, high-order
   time accuracy (higher than second order) is seldom achieved for FSI
   problems. We present thorough time-step refinement studies for a rigid
   oscillating-airfoil on deforming meshes to confirm the time accuracy on
   the extracted aerodynamics reactions of IRK time integrators up to fifth
   order. Efficiency of the proposed approach is then tested on a stiff FSI
   problem of flow-induced vibrations of a flexible strip. The time-step
   refinement studies indicate the following: stability of the proposed
   approach is always observed even with large time step and spurious
   oscillations on the structure are avoided without added damping. While
   higher order IRK schemes require more memory than classical schemes
   (implicit Euler), they are faster for a given level of temporal accuracy
   in two dimensions. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{An implicit approach is modified and extended for numerical simulation
   of four-coupled transport equations in the transition model. The method
   preserves the positivity of all turbulence and transition variables

   shown to perform best. The developed numerical procedure is very robust
   and displays excellent convergence properties, two characteristics which
   have not been previously well reported in the literature. The approach
   is thoroughly verified for a range of two-dimensional transitional flow
   benchmarks, for which good agreement is observed in comparison with

Volume = {{114}},

Abstract = {{The volume-averaged Navier-Stokes (VANS) equations are a key constituent
   of numerous models used to study complex problems such as flows in
   porous medias or containing multiple phases (e.g. solid-liquid flows).
   These equations solve the mesoscopic scale of the flow without taking
   into account explicitly each individual solid particles, therefore
   greatly reducing computational cost. However, due to a lack of
   analytical solutions, the models using the VANS equations are generally
   validated directly against experimental data or empirical correlations.
   In this work, a framework to design analytical solutions and verify
   codes that solve the VANS equations via the method of manufactured
   solutions is presented for the first time. Three test cases of
   increasing complexity are designed with this method and used to assess
   the second-order convergence of a finite volume solver developed in Open
   del FOAM. The proposed approach is suitable for the verification of any
   code that solves the VANS equations with any CFD technique such as the
   finite element method or the lattice Boltzmann method. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The Chemical Engineering curriculum at Polytechnique Montreal is
   structured to gradually provide more and more autonomy to the students.
   The third-year Unit Operations is taught using an outcomes-based
   approach and represents a turning point in the undergraduate curriculum
   where rubrics-based assessments overtake normative assessments. This
   begs the question: is it really necessary to divulge the average to
   students following assessments? Those from a more industrial background
   see the average as an unnecessary crutch for students, while the more
   academically inclined see it as a useful pedagogical tool to provide
   feedback and help students determine if they have attained their
   learning objectives. To settle this debate, we set into motion a
   yearlong study during which the average results to tests were withheld.
   Students were asked to predict their grade and the class average, and
   provide feedback on the assessment process. Results show that students
   are able to predict the average, but have difficulty predicting their
   individual performance (especially before a test, where more than 50\%
   of students are off by a factor of more than 10\%). Students award more
   importance to their personal sense of learning satisfaction than their
   position with respect to the average, and do not systematically use the
   average to plan study time (despite preferring to know it). Thus, it may
   be possible to substitute alternate frames of reference to the class
   average in an outcomes-based course, but this is not necessarily
   desirable and should at the very least be the subject of a more open
   discussion. (c) 2015 The Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by

Abstract = {{We report a simple route for the synthesis of several morphologies of
   self-assembling hierarchical Ni (OH) 2 nanostructures, by the reaction
   of NiSO4 and NH4OH in aqueous solution, at a constant temperature, using
   neither surfactant nor template. Both morphology and microstructure
   depend on the concentrations of the reactants, the reaction temperature
   and the anions (Cl-, .., NO3- and SO42-) present. The nanostructures
   have been characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and x-ray
   diffraction (XRD). When SO42- is used, irrespective of the presence of
   other anions, only microspheres of hierarchical Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets are
   present, suggesting that this anion plays a critical role in microsphere
   formation. Electrochemical characterizations of Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets
   show good supercapacitor performance, with relatively high capacity and
   excellent rate capability, indicating that these hierarchical Ni(OH)(2)
   nanosheets are serious candidates for energy storage applications. The
   growth mechanism for nanosheet formation is discussed, based on SEM
   observations under different preparation conditions, detailing the
   transition from nanoparticles to nanowires to nanosheets. The specific
   surface area and the thickness of our Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets have been
   determined to be 149.6 m(2) g(-1) and 20-30 nm, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, there are no established treatments to prevent, stop, or even
   retard the degeneration of articular cartilage in osteoarthritis (OA).
   Biological repair of the degenerating articular cartilage would be
   preferable to surgery. There is no benign site where autologous
   chondrocytes can be harvested and used as a cell source for cartilage
   repair, leaving mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as an attractive option.
   However, MSCs from OA patients have been shown to constitutively express
   collagen type X (COL-X), a marker of late-stage chondrocyte hypertrophy.
   We recently found that naproxen (Npx), but not other nonsteroidal
   anti-inflammatory drugs, can induce collagen type X alpha 1 (COL10A1)
   gene expression in bone marrow-derived MSCs from healthy and OA donors.
   In this study, we determined the effect of Npx on COL10A1 expression and
   investigated the intracellular signaling pathways that mediate such
   effect in normal human MSCs during chondrogenesis. MSCs were cultured in
   standard chondrogenic differentiation media supplemented with or without
   Npx. Our results show that Npx can regulate chondrogenic differentiation
   by affecting the gene expression of both Indian hedgehog and parathyroid
   hormone/parathyroid hormone-related protein signaling pathways in a
   time-dependent manner, suggesting a complex interaction of different
   signaling pathways during the process.}},

Abstract = {{An overdamped slug test may be analyzed using several methods, which are
   known to yield different results for the hydraulic conductivity. The
   methods belong to three groups: group 1 neglects the influence of the
   solid matrix strain, group 2 is for tests in aquitards with delayed
   strain caused by consolidation, and group 3 tries to take into account
   the elastic and instant solid matrix strain. This paper deals with slug
   tests in aquifers and, thus, considers the groups 1 and 3. In practice,
   users select a single theory, which avoids having divergent values.
   However, this means that something is wrong with the theories. This
   paper explains what is wrong, and why. First, an approach is proposed to
   detect inconsistencies. The test data are presented in two semi-log
   graphs and a third, derivative graph along with theoretical predictions:
   these are the three diagnostic graphs. The shapes of the semi-log plots
   are shown to be altered markedly by a small inaccuracy in assumed
   piezometric level. The derivative plot does not depend upon this assumed
   piezometric level, but can verify its correctness. Most often, the
   assumed piezometric level cannot be defined with enough accuracy to
   avoid systematic bias in the test data. If this is ignored, the results
   of the first two plots cannot fit a theory. The derivative plot has been
   used for thousands of slug tests in confined and unconfined aquifers. It
   appears that all test data follow only one theory, that of group 1. An
   examination of equations and assumptions concerning solid matrix
   deformation shows that the group-3 theory, unfortunately, mistreats the
   links between fluid mechanics and solid mechanics. Therefore, the
   proposed three-diagnostic-graphs approach unifies the two theories,
   helps us to find and to be aware of what is wrong in the group-3 theory,
   and, most important, it yields a user-independent final result.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical algorithms and solutions of generalized nonlinear lifting-line
   theory over an elliptical wing are examined, with emphasis on
   near/poststall flows. First, a thorough analysis on the
   circulation-based and angle-of-attack-based correction methods ( and
   methods, respectively) highlights their respective numerical poststall
   characteristics. The stability of the method is demonstrated, producing
   single and multiple solutions in the pre- and poststall regions,
   respectively. Second, artificial dissipation added to the method is
   shown to be an effective means of controlling the poststall flow region.
   Finally, a strongly coupled algorithm is presented, allowing to bypass
   the interpolation phase via the use of Legendre polynomials. The model
   sheds light on poststall flow behavior, in agreement with several papers
   studying formation of stall cell patterns.}},

Abstract = {{This work introduces the use of the treed Gaussian processes (TGP) as a

   constraints. MADS uses TGP in two ways: one, as a surrogate for blackbox
   evaluations; and two, to evaluate statistical criteria such as the
   expected improvement and the average reduction in variance. The
   efficiency of the method is tested on five problems: a synthetic one
   with many local optima, a synthetic one implying a numerical method, one
   real application from a chemical engineering simulator for styrene
   production, one from contaminant cleanup and hydrology, and one
   multidisciplinary design optimization application. In all five cases we
   show that the TGP surrogate is preferable to a quadratic model and to
   MADS without any surrogate at all.}},

Title = {{Assessment of cold cracking tests for low transformation temperature
   martensitic stainless steel multipass welds}},
Journal = {{WELDING IN THE WORLD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{521-532}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In the last decades, low-carbon soft-martensitic stainless steels have
   been widely used by heavy industries such as hydraulic turbine and
   pipeline manufacturing. Their good corrosion resistance, high mechanical
   strength, and good cavitation erosion resistance combined with their
   relatively good weldability explain this success. However, arc welding
   operations of thick plates still require significant preheating to avoid
   cold cracking. From a practical point of view, this requirement can
   complicate manufacturing operations and limit the use of these alloys
   for some applications. It thus becomes important to assess their cold
   cracking susceptibility in order to reduce preheating temperature. The
   discrepancy between industrial observations in multipass welds and the
   results obtained from the standardized cold cracking test such as Tekken
   and GBOP (gapped bead-on-plate) tests led to a modification of the GBOP
   test as presented here. In order to reproduce the behavior of industrial
   cold cracks, a comparison between Tekken and GBOP tests was set up for
   the assessment of the cold cracking susceptibility of multipass 13\%
   Cr-4\% Ni soft martensitic stainless steels welded with 410NiMo filler
   alloy. A two-bead GBOP test was proposed. This modification is necessary
   because the low martensitic transformation temperature of the 13\%
   Cr-4\% Ni stainless steels reverses the residual stress in the weld,
   preventing the possibility of cold cracking. A second bead is needed to
   induce tensile stress in the first bead so that crack may be generated
   as in industrial conditions. The relevance of these modifications is
   presented and discussed using contour method residual stress
   measurements and acoustic emission crack detection.}},

Abstract = {{Fabrication, characterization, and applications of a fast rotary linear
   optical delay line (FRLODL) for THz time-domain spectroscopy are
   presented. The FRLODL features two reflective surfaces with spatially
   separated incoming and outgoing beams. It has been manufactured using
   CNC machining. A linear dependence of the optical delay on the rotation
   angle allows a straightforward extraction of the conversion factor
   between the acquisition time (in ms) and the terahertz pulse time (in
   ps). We also discuss the accuracy of the rotary delay line detailing the
   possible sources of imprecision. The FRLODL has been tested using
   rotation speeds of up to 48 Hz, corresponding to an acquisition rate of
   up to 192 Hz with four blades incorporated on the same disk. At high
   speeds we observe a decrease of the bandwidth due to the limitations of
   the electronics, in particular, the transimpedance amplifier. An error
   analysis is performed by experimentally evaluating the signal-to-noise
   ratio and the dynamic range. With regard to the applications of the
   FRLODL, we first present observation of the evaporation of liquids,
   namely water, acetone and methanol. We then demonstrate monitoring of
   the spray painting process. Finally, detection of fast moving objects at
   1 m/s and their thickness characterization are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Fluidelastic instability is the most destructive phenomenon in steam
   generators and boilers. This phenomenon can be reproduced in
   laboratories by considering cylinder arrays subjected to cross-flow. We
   use the quasi-steady model to study the stability of the central tube in
   a parallel triangular tube bundle. The model relies strongly on the
   derivative of the lift coefficient to predict the onset of the negative
   damping mechanism and static divergence. In this work, we experimentally
   study the effect of the Reynolds number on the lift coefficient
   derivative on the central tube, for a parallel triangular array with P/D
   = 1.5 and low Reynolds number between 20 and 700. Direct numerical
   simulation (DNS) results are also presented for low values of the
   Reynolds number, between 20 and 400, and different tube array
   geometries. The effect of higher Reynolds number was considered using
   results from the literature for Reynolds numbers in the range {[}2 x
   10(4)-2 x 10(6)] and also the potential flow theory. It was found that
   the lift coefficient derivative strongly depends on the Reynolds number
   for the lower range of Reynolds number {[}0,1000]. Additionally,
   numerical methods (DNS and potential) allowed one to investigate the
   effect of pitch ratio and orientation of the array. The sensitivity of
   the lift coefficient derivative on these parameters provides some
   perspective on the scatter in the data found in the literature. As a
   result of this study, the effect of the Reynolds number on the stability
   of a single flexible tube is discussed. The quasi-steady model seems
   unable to predict the experimental results for the critical velocity,
   for high values of the Reynolds number. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A general method, based on susceptibility tensors, is proposed for the
   synthesis of metasurfaces transforming arbitrary incident waves into
   arbitrary reflected and transmitted waves. The proposed method exhibits
   two advantages: 1) it is inherently vectorial, and therefore better
   suited for full vectorial (beyond paraxial) electromagnetic problems; 2)
   it provides closed-form solutions, and is therefore extremely fast.
   Incidentally, the method reveals that a metasurface is fundamentally
   capable to transform up to four independent wave triplets (incident,
   reflected, and refracted waves). In addition, this paper provides the
   closed-form expressions relating the synthesized susceptibilities and
   the scattering parameters simulated within periodic boundary conditions,
   which allows one to design the scattering particles realizing the
   desired susceptibilities. The versatility of the method is illustrated
   by examples of metasurfaces achieving the following transformations:
   generalized refraction, reciprocal and nonreciprocal polarization
   rotation, Bessel vortex beam generation, and orbital angular momentum
   multiplexing.}},

   7075-T6 aluminum alloy}},

Abstract = {{Clean machining is gaining ground as one of the crucial issues in future
   manufacturing. Many machining industries are looking for alternative
   solutions to wet machining because of the costs of the latter, including
   environmental costs, as well as its impact on occupational health and
   safety. Dry machining is being proposed, but in most conditions, the
   cutting tool wears out quicker, leading to part quality deterioration
   and increased machining costs. Minimum quantity lubrication (MQL)
   machining is also proposed to maintain a reasonable tool life and
   limited cost, as compared to the situation with flood or wet machining.
   Both the MQL and dry machining methods, however, are susceptible to the
   generation of aerosols containing metallic particles that can be
   detrimental to occupational health and safety. Minimizing particle
   emissions is of prime importance since these can have serious
   consequences on the operator's health. They have been seen to be at a
   minimum at two specific cutting ranges. In this study, investigations
   are done to examine the effect of lubrication (dry and MQL) during the
   turning of the 7075-T6 aluminum alloy. The performance indexes studied
   are the surface roughness, the chip thickness, and aerosol generation.}},

Abstract = {{This study was aimed at improving the process rheology of polylactide
   (PLA) melts by means of two strategies. First, PLAs of different
   branched structures, i.e., star shaped, comblike, and hyper branched,
   were synthesized and blended with a linear grade analog. Shear and
   extensional flow rheometry tests were performed on pure materials and
   their blends to evaluate their rheological properties. It was shown that
   the presence of branched poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) increased the shear
   thinning, shear and extensional viscosity, and elastic modulus of linear
   PLLA at the same time; the star shaped PLLA providing the most
   significant change. Second, poly(D-lactides) (PDLA) with similar
   molecular architectures were synthesized to have a double branching
   effect. In addition to the presence of branched architecture, physical
   cross-links due to the stereocomplex formation exist between PLLA and
   PDLA chains. Based on the rheological characterizations in shear and
   extensional mode, a greater improvement in PLA melt rheological
   properties was observed for blends containing stereocomplex structure as
   compared to linear/branched enantiopure blends. (C) 2015 The Society of

Title = {{Tension Lap Splices Strengthened with Ultrahigh-Performance
   Fiber-Reinforced Concrete}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of an experimental program undertaken
   for evaluating the effectiveness of ultrahigh performance
   fiber-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) for strengthening deficient tension
   lap splices. A total of 18 full-scale beam specimens were tested.
   Tension reinforcement consisted of two deformed bars spliced at midspan.
   The strengthening technique consists of replacing normal concrete in the
   splice region with UHPFRC. One type of fiber concrete was used in this
   experimental program. It is characterized by a compressive strength of
   130MPa, a high tensile strength of 10MPa, and ductile strain hardening
   characteristics in direct tension. The parameters considered were:
   splice length, bar diameter, repair depth, and bar relative position. To
   isolate the contribution of UHPFRC, no stirrups were used. The results
   clearly show the effectiveness of UHPFRC for strengthening deficient lap
   splices. Failure by splitting in the lap splice region was completely
   eliminated due to the high tensile strength and energy absorption
   capabilities of the UHPFRC used. Bond stresses that were more than twice
   those of normal concrete were observed. The UHPFRC ductility allows for
   the development of quasi-plastic tensile stresses around the reinforcing
   bars to resist the splitting forces. For the selected UHPFRC, this
   stress was evaluated at approximately 7.3MPa, which is applicable to
   tensile strains of up to 0.2\% before the formation of discrete cracks.
   Although the paper focuses on rehabilitation, the results are also
   applicable to new constructions. Suggestions for further research and
   better classification of UHPFRC for structural applications are
   identified.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, two PDE-based mapping operators for the generation of
   unstructured meshes are compared. While the Winslow operator allows the
   construction of valid meshes for most configurations, the
   functional-based operators based on area, length, orthogonality and
   their combinations provide a finer control on the resulting meshes. Two
   distinct discretization methods of the operators are also compared. An
   original approach using a finite difference scheme on unstructured
   meshes is implemented and compared to a finite volume formulation. While
   more complex to implement and control, mainly because of the
   cross-derivative terms which must be carefully discretized, the finite
   volume method yields a more robust and stable formulation that allows
   dealing with sharp curvature variations of the boundaries. Finally, a
   criterion for the mesh smoothness which has a global definition is
   presented in order to compare the smoothness of the resulting mesh
   obtained by different operators.}},

Abstract = {{The service life of Polymer Matrix Composite Materials can be severely
   affected by long exposures to elevated temperatures. This study
   investigated the high temperature durability of a carbon/MVK10
   triaxially braided textile composite. The goal was to monitor, analyze
   and quantify the evolution of physical and chemical aging processes to
   verify if Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations for maximum
   service temperature ensure the safe use of such materials. Tensile tests
   were performed at the maximum service temperature on aged samples in two
   material directions to evaluate the progression of stiffness and
   Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS) degradation. Aging induced damage was
   observed with the help of microscopic observations on the edges and
   cross-sections of tensile samples prior to loading. It was found that
   aging had a significant effect on UTS. It was also observed that the
   rate of deterioration was different for samples cut along different
   material directions, pointing towards anisotropic degradation mechanisms
   promoted by the braiding architecture. The investigated material had
   performances similar to existing high temperature composites, albeit at
   a lower temperature. It would therefore seem that FAA rules for setting
   the operating temperature are suitable for this material when aging
   effects are taken into consideration at the design stages. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Past numerical and experimental research has shown that the draft tube
   inlet velocity is critically important to hydropower plant performance,
   especially in the case of low-head installations. However, less is known
   about the influence of flow parameters on turbine performance
   particularly swirl distribution. Based on the influence of draft tube
   flow characteristics on the overall performance of a low-head turbine,
   this research proposes a methodology for optimizing draft tube inlet
   velocity profiles as a new approach to controlling the flow conditions
   in order to yield better draft tube and turbine performance. Numerical
   optimization methods have been used successfully for a variety of design
   problems. However, addressing the optimization of boundary conditions in
   hydraulic turbines poses a new challenge. In this paper, three different
   vortex equations for representing the inlet velocity profile are applied
   to a cone diffuser, and the behavior of the objective function is
   analyzed. As well, the influence of the quantitative correlation between
   the swirling flow at the cone inlet and the analytical blade shape, flow
   rate, and swirl number using the best inlet velocity profiles is
   evaluated. We also include a discussion on the development of a flow
   structure caused by the inlet swirl parameters. Finally, we present an
   analysis of the influence of flow rate and swirl number on the behavior
   of the optimization process.}},

Abstract = {{The quadratic minimum spanning tree problem (QMSTP) consists of finding
   a spanning tree of a graph G such that a quadratic cost function is
   minimized. In its adjacent only version (AQMSTP), interaction costs only
   apply for edges that share an endpoint. Motivated by the weak lower
   bounds provided by formulations in the literature, we present a new
   linear integer programming formulation for AQMSTP. In addition to
   decision variables assigned to the edges, it also makes use of variables
   assigned to the stars of G. In doing so, the model is naturally linear
   (integer), without the need of implementing usual linearization steps,
   and its linear programming relaxation better estimates the interaction
   costs between edges. We also study a reformulation derived from the new
   model, obtained by projecting out the decision variables associated with
   the stars. Two exact solution approaches are presented: a
   branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm, based on the first formulation, and
   a branch-and-cut algorithm, based on its projection. Our computational
   results indicate that the lower bounds introduced here are much stronger
   than previous bounds in the literature. Being designed for the adjacent
   only case, our duality gaps are one order of magnitude smaller than the
   Gilmore-Lawler lower bounds for AQMSTP. As a result, the two exact
   algorithms introduced here outperform the previous exact solution
   approaches in the literature. In particular, the branch-and-cut method
   we propose managed to solve AQMSTP instances with as many as 50 vertices
   to proven optimality. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. NETWORKS, Vol.

Abstract = {{Poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) is a hydrophobic bioplastic under
   development for bone tissue engineering applications. Limited
   information is available on the role of internal geometry and
   cell-surface attachment on osseous integration potential. We tested the
   hypothesis that human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) deposit
   more mineral inside porous 3D PCL scaffolds with fully interconnected 84
   or 141 mu m pores, when the surfaces are coated with chitosan via
   Layer-by-Layer (LbL)-deposited polyelectrolytes. Freshly trypsinized
   MSCs were seeded on PCL 3D cylinders using a novel static cold seeding
   method in 2\% serum to optimally populate all depths of the scaffold
   discs, followed by 10 days of culture in proliferation medium and 21
   additional days in osteogenic medium. MSCs were observed by SEM and
   histology to spread faster and to proliferate more on chitosan-coated
   pore surfaces. Most pores, with or without chitosan, became filled by
   collagen networks sparsely populated with fibroblast-like cells. After
   21 days of culture in osteogenic medium, sporadic matrix mineralization
   was detected histologically and by micro-CT in highly cellular surface
   layers that enveloped all scaffolds and in cell aggregates in 141 mu m
   pores near the edges. LbL-chitosan promoted punctate mineral deposition
   on the surfaces of 84 mu m pores (p<0.05 vs. PCL-only) but not the 141

Abstract = {{Tailoring the solid waste-based fuel composition is essential to improve
   the combustion efficiency and control the resulting emissions. In the
   present study, a dry step-wise process has been developed in a
   pilot-scale setup to recover the main combustible elements of shredded
   bulky waste (SBW) consisting of 72\% fiber, 12\% soft plastic and 8\%
   hard plastic. For this purpose, the SBW is initially elutriated to
   enhance the processability of the feedstock and separate its lightest
   components. Elutriation of SBW at U-e = 1.5 m/s for 15 min could result
   in the effective separation of light components, i.e., fiber and soft
   plastic. These components are then separated from each other in a second
   elutriation column at U-e = 02 m/s for 2-3 min. In the presence of a
   proper fluidization medium, the non-elutriated fraction of the SBW is
   further separated into non-combustible, undesirable combustible
   components and hard plastic through two consecutive steps. Size and
   density of the bed medium as well as the initial configuration of the
   bed inventory are the parameters governing the recovery and purity
   percentage of the fluidization steps. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Until now, a typical computational scheme for the DRAGON5 lattice code
   was based on a resonance self-shielding method using the Subgroup
   Projection Method (SPM) coupled with a flux calculation using the Method
   of Characteristics (MOC), both solved over a 295-group
   Santamarina-Hfaiedh energy mesh (SHEM). We are investigating the
   accuracy of an optimized 2-level computational scheme based on a
   condensation stage from 295 to 26 energy groups. A first level flux
   calculation is performed using the Interface Current (IC) method on the
   295-group mesh, followed by a detailed second level flux calculation
   using the MOC on the 26-group mesh. Here, we validate the 2-level scheme
   by comparison with the 1-level scheme and with Monte Carlo calculations
   at burnup 0 and with isotopic depletion. Validation results were
   obtained using Monte Carlo codes SERPENT2 and TRIPOLI4. This study shows
   that an optimized 2-level scheme is much faster than the corresponding
   1-level scheme and leads to numerical results without a significant
   degradation in term of precision. The proposed 2-level schemes are
   therefore candidate for CPU-efficient production tools for generating
   multi-parameter reactor databases. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new miniaturized on-chip photodetector front-end
   targeted for portable near infrared spectroscopy as a noninvasive tool
   for real-time brain imaging. It includes silicon avalanche photodiodes
   (SiAPDs) with dual detection modes using a transimpedance amplifier
   (TIA) with on-chip gain/bias control, and a controllable mixed
   (active-passive) quench circuit, with tunable hold-off time, and a novel
   gated quench-reset technique. This integrated photoreceiver front-end
   has been fabricated using submicrometer standard CMOS technologies with
   a minimum fill-factor of 95\%. Fabricated SiAPDs exhibit avalanche gains
   of 35 and 22 at 10 and 18 V bias voltages with red-shifted peak
   photon-detection efficiency and dark count-rates of 114 and 4 kHz (at 1
   V excess bias voltage). The TIA consumes 1-mW power, and offers a
   transimpedance gain of 250 MV/A, a tunable bandwidth (1 kHz-1 GHz), and
   an input current referred noise < 10 fA/root Hz at 1 kHz. The
   photon-counter exhibits a quench-time of 10 ns with a 0.4-mW
   power-consumption with an adaptive hold-off time control. The on-chip
   integration of SiAPDs and front-end circuit, reduced the
   power-consumption and after-pulsing, and increased the sensitivity.}},

Abstract = {{A study is conducted with the aim of developing and implementing a
   fatigue prediction model for assessing the damage tolerance capabilities
   of polymer matrix composite structures. The damage mechanics based model
   uses empirical material parameters to represent orthotropic damage
   evolution. The model accounts for local multiaxial stresses as well as
   variable amplitude cyclic loading, which may result from local stress
   redistributions caused by damage evolution. The numerical results show
   the capability of the developed model to predict the variation of damage
   evolution and material property degradation in a tri-axially braided
   carbon fiber polymer matrix component. The predictions are validated by
   independent experiments on composite components using digital image
   correlation, which shows a strong correlation between the measured and
   predicted strain contours at various cyclic intervals. This is a key
   contribution and a step forward in developing a viable design tool for
   assessing the integrity and durability of composite structures. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The (NiO + CaO + MgO + SiO2) system and its ternary subsystems (NiO +
   CaO + MgO) and (NiO + CaO + SiO2) have been studied by a combination of
   thermodynamic modeling and experimental measurements of phase
   equilibria. A complete literature review and critical evaluation of
   phase diagrams and thermodynamic properties of all oxide phases in these
   systems at 1 atm total pressure are presented. To resolve the
   contradictions in the literature data for the (NiO + CaO + SiO2) system,
   a new experimental investigation has been carried out over the
   temperature range from (1330 to 1500)degrees C using an equilibration
   and quenching technique followed by electron probe X-ray microanalysis
   (EPMA). The compositions of phases for equilibria among liquid,
   pseudo-wollastonite, clino-pyroxene, olivine and tridymite have been
   measured. The whole set of experimental data, including the new
   experimental results and previously published data, is taken into
   consideration in thermodynamic modeling of oxide phases and optimization
   of model parameters. The Modified Quasichemical Model is used for the
   liquid phase. The models for olivine, melilite and pyroxene solid
   solutions are developed within the framework of the Compound Energy
   Formalism. A self-consistent set of thermodynamic functions of all
   phases in the (NiO + CaO + MgO + SiO2) system is obtained, which
   reproduces all available thermodynamic and phase diagram data within

Abstract = {{This study explores how the rheological and crystallization properties
   of linear polypropylene (PP) are changed by incorporating fibrillated
   polyethylene terephthalate (PET). PET domains are fibrillated by melt
   blending with PP followed by drawing. In uniaxial extensional flows, the
   PP/fibrillated-PET shows strain hardening behavior, not observed for
   PP/PET blends with spherical PET domains or for the neat PP. At PET
   fibril contents >= 3 wt\%, a plateau appears in the storage modulus at
   low frequencies, indicating the formation of a percolated physical
   network of fibrils that responds elastically over long timescales.
   Avrami analysis of the crystallization of PP/fibrillated-PET at ambient
   and elevated CO2 pressures reveals that the PET fibrils enhance the
   kinetics of isothermal crystallization of PP under both pressure
   conditions. WAXS study shows that when PP/fibrillated-PET is
   isothermally crystallized at high pressures, gamma-phase crystal
   formation of PP is promoted which is representative of superior

Abstract = {{In this study, the morphology and miscibility of poly(lactic acid), PLA,
   and poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate), PBAT, blends were studied
   in detail. Three techniques to examine the morphology of PLA/PBAT are
   compared: SEM using lower secondary electron imaging (LEI), SEM using
   low-angle backscattered electrons (LABE) and atomic force microscopy
   (AFM). The interfacial tension of the system was examined by fitting the
   Palieme model to the rheological data and the results indicate a very
   low value of 0.6 +/- 0.15 mN/m. The miscibility in PLA/PBAT blends was
   studied by modulated DSC and the results show a limited one-way partial
   miscibility of PBAT in the PIA-rich phase with the glass transition
   temperature of the PLA-rich phase in PBAT showing a drop of up to 10
   degrees C, as compared to the neat PLA. Further investigations reveal
   that this effect depends significantly on the molecular weight of PBAT
   and underlines the strong entropic nature of this partial miscibility.
   The morphology at 1 vol.\% of the dispersed phase shows that the
   dispersed phase exists in a stable fiber form even at these very low
   concentrations, an observation which is compatible with partial
   miscibility, with fiber diameters of 300 nm for PLA in PBAT and 150 nm
   for PBAT in PLA. The influence of composition on the dispersed phase
   fiber diameter shows a significant increase in fiber diameter with minor
   phase concentration which is not a result of classic coalescence, but
   more a result of the partial miscibility phenomenon. The region of
   dual-phase continuity has been examined by a rheological approach and is
   determined to be a wide and highly symmetric region with the lower and
   upper limits located between 30-40 and 60 -70 vol.\% of PBAT,
   respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the effects of liquid phase rheology on the hydrodynamics
   of a pilot scale bubble column reactor is extensively investigated by
   applying various types of test liquids with different rheological
   characteristics as the operating fluids. Two fiber optic probes and
   several pressure transducers are used and different time domain and
   frequency domain analyses are applied to perform a comprehensive
   interpretation of the pressure signals and measure the hydrodynamic
   parameters of the gas phase. A new approach is proposed based on the
   dynamic moduli of viscoelastic solutions to better understand the
   simultaneous viscous and elastic effects It was observed that the
   elasticity of the operating liquid reduced the average bubble chord
   length and increased the total gas holdup. The obtained results reveal
   that although the viscosity is more favorable for coalescence, the
   elasticity of the operating liquid can prevent bubble coalescence by
   showing a solid like behavior at the interface of two bubbles. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The penalty of extending the cavity length of a laser diode when seeking
   a linewidth reduction is normally revealed by poor side mode
   suppression, which prevents the laser from operating purely in a single
   mode of the external cavity. A hybrid laser, based on a C-band
   semiconductor optical amplifier combined with a long erbium doped fiber
   external cavity, is carefully engineered to operate with high spectral
   purity and outstanding stability. For the first time, a side-mode
   suppression ratio of >= 42 dB, measured at a resolution of 1.16 pm (149
   MHz) at all intra-cavity powers above the lasing threshold, is reported.
   The output power at the peak lasing wavelength is 13.3 dBm. Also, the
   ability to lock such a hybrid laser to a particular external-cavity mode
   is realized for the first time. Excluding the effect of mechanical and
   thermal drifts on the cavity length, the long-term frequency stability
   is demonstrated to be within +/- 11 Hz while the long-term linewidth is
   2.26 kHz, measured using the self-beating technique under free running
   conditions. (C)2015 Optical Society of America}},

Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a procedure based on the Backward Differentiation
   Formulas of order 1 to 5 to obtain efficient time integration of the
   incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The adaptive algorithm performs
   both stepsize and order selections to control respectively the solution
   accuracy and the computational efficiency of the time integration
   process. The stepsize selection (h-adaptivity) is based on a local error
   estimate and an error controller to guarantee that the numerical
   solution accuracy is within a user prescribed tolerance. The order
   selection (p-adaptivity) relies on the idea that low-accuracy solutions
   can be computed efficiently by low order time integrators while accurate
   solutions require high order time integrators to keep computational time
   low. The selection is based on a stability test that detects growing
   numerical noise and deems a method of order p stable if there is no
   method of lower order that delivers the same solution accuracy for a
   larger stepsize. Hence, it guarantees both that (1) the used method of
   integration operates inside of its stability region and (2) the time
   integration procedure is computationally efficient. The proposed time
   integration procedure also features a time-step rejection and quarantine
   mechanisms, a modified Newton method with a predictor and dense output
   techniques to compute solution at off-step points. (C) 2015 Published by

Abstract = {{The magnetic force exerted by an array of two coaxial thick circular
   coils with rectangular cross-sections in air is important to both
   electrical and mechanical engineering applications. The magnetic force
   is typically calculated by taking the integral over the entire space
   defined by the array. This calculation even for this simple array is an
   intractable problem and numerical methods have been extensively used. In
   this work, the integration was subdivided into five regions, and in four
   of them, an analytical formula was found. The method proposed here is
   based on the Green's function of the free space that leads to the
   elliptical integral of the first and second kind. The formula reveals
   new insights into how the geometry and relative positioning of the coils
   within the array determines the strength of the magnetic force. The
   thicker the coils are and the farther apart they are, the weaker the
   magnetic force is, and vice versa. This new formula is simpler and
   practically free of truncation errors, which are commonly encountered in
   numerical approximations. Several examples from the literature were used
   to corroborate the present formulation. The results show an excellent
   agreement with respect to the different numerical and semi-analytical
   approaches used by other authors.}},

Abstract = {{Effect of chain architecture on homocrystallization and stereocomplex
   formation behavior of polylactide (PLA) in quiescent conditions was
   investigated by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and
   optical microscopy. Non-isothermal and isothermal crystallization of
   star shaped, comb like and hyper branched poly(L-lactides) (PLLAs) with
   similar molecular weights were studied and compared to a linear one. In
   dynamic mode, branched PLAs reached higher crystallinity and revealed
   much higher spherulite density as compared to linear PLA. Also blends of
   linear and branched PLA with different blending ratios revealed faster
   crystallization than neat linear PLA. Based on kinetics data obtained in
   isothermal crystallization experiments, much faster crystallization was
   achieved with a 4-14 fold decrease in crystallization half-time as a
   consequence of non-linear chain architecture. Crystallization upon
   cooling, reduced cold crystallization temperature, increased spherulite
   density and lower Avrami exponent values for branched PLAs in comparison
   to linear one suggest enhanced nucleation process as a result of a
   branched chain architecture. On the other hand, total crystallinity and
   growth rate were decreased by branching. Stereocomplex formation between
   linear PLLA and branched poly(D-lactides) (PDLAs) showed dependency of
   stereocomplex formation to branched architecture. Also, stereocomplex
   crystals nucleated PLA homocrystallization process while different
   internal morphology between stereocomplex and homocrystal spherulites
   was observed. These results confirm that chain architecture has a
   profound effect on the crystallization behavior of PLA. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This paper presents the development of a novel spiral heat source model
   based on the Green's function method that takes into account axial
   effects. This new model is based on the principle of spatial
   superposition of heat sources to model the varying thermal response in
   spiral coil heat exchangers (SCHE) as a function of depth. It also
   proposes new input parameters, inlet fluid temperature and mass flow
   rate instead of heat transfer rate, which is now obtained by performing
   an iterative process. To perform simulations of time-varying thermal
   loads, a temporal superposition along with an aggregation algorithm is
   developed. The new model is compared to other models for both constant
   and variable loads to evaluate the importance of taking into account
   axial effects and the variation of the thermal response with depth in
   SCHEs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Facility layout design has an important effect on the performance of
   manufacturing systems. It intends to determine relative location of
   departments and machines within a plant. A good layout design must
   ensure that a set of criteria and objectives are met and optimised, e.g.
   area requirements, cost, communication and safety. The most common
   objective used in facility planning methods is to minimise the
   transportation cost. However, factors such as the plant safety,
   flexibility for future design changes, noise and aesthetics must be
   considered as well. In this paper, a case study is carried out to
   investigate the safety concerns in facility layout design. In this
   regard, a facility layout planning methodology, integrating occupational
   health and safety (OHS) is presented. This methodology considers
   transportation cost as well as safety in the facility design. By this
   means, OHS issues are considered at the design stage of the facility. In
   other words, this research demonstrates the improvements in the layout
   design by integrating safety aspects.}},

Abstract = {{An influential factor affecting the efficiency of a manufacturing
   facility is its layout. In a production facility, measure for efficiency
   can be based on the total cost of transporting the items between
   different departments and throughout the facility. However, other
   factors may influence efficiency of the manufacturing facility too. As
   such are: supporting the organisation's vision through improved material
   handling, material flow and control; effectively assigning people,
   equipment, space and energy; minimising capital investment; adaptability
   and ease of maintenance; as well as providing for employee safety and
   job satisfaction. By incorporating health and safety measures in the
   initial design of a facility layout, the organisation may avoid money
   and manpower loss resulting from industrial accidents. This paper
   proposes a facility layout planning methodology which integrates the
   occupational health and safety (OHS) features in the early design of a
   facility layout. The model considers transportation cost in the facility
   as well as safety concerns. By this means, the OHS issues are reflected
   prior to the construction of a facility.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a driver behavior analysis using microscopic video

   of adverse winter weather conditions on highway driving behavior based
   on automated (computer) and manual methods. The research was conducted
   through two case studies. The first case study was conducted to evaluate
   the feasibility of applying an automated approach to extracting driver
   behavior data based on 15 video recordings obtained in the winter 2013
   at three different locations on the Don Valley Parkway in Toronto,
   Canada. A comparison was made between the automated approach and manual
   approach, and issues in collecting data using the automated approach
   under winter conditions were identified. The second case study was based
   on high quality data collected in the winter 2014, at a location on
   Highway 25 in Montreal, Canada. The results demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the automated analytical framework in analyzing driver
   behavior, as well as evaluating the impact of adverse winter weather
   conditions on driver behavior. This approach could be applied to
   evaluate winter maintenance strategies and crash risk on highways during

Abstract = {{Space access and satellites lifespan are increasingly threatened by the
   great amount of debris in Low Earth Orbits. Among the many solutions
   proposed in the literature so far, the emphasis is put here on a robotic
   arm mounted on a ``chaser{''} satellite to capture massive debris, such
   as dead satellites or launch vehicle upper stages. The modeling and
   control of such systems are investigated throughout the paper. Dynamic
   models rely on an adapted Newton-Euler algorithm, and control algorithms
   are based on the fixed-structure H-infinity synthesis, recently
   implemented in an efficient Matlab toolbox. The main goal is to
   efficiently track a target point on the debris while using PD-ike
   controllers to reduce computational burden. The fixed-tructure H
   infinity framework proves to be a suitable tool to design a
   reduced-order robust controller that catches up with external
   disturbances and is simultaneously compatible with current space
   processors capabilities.}},

Title = {{Determination of Enthalpy of Pyrolysis from DSC and Industrial Reactor

Journal = {{CHEMICAL PRODUCT AND PROCESS MODELING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{97-111}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This study was motivated by the fact that differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC)/differential thermal analysis (DTA) results in
   literature showed significant exothermic peaks while in overall,
   pyrolysis is an endothermic phenomenon. The specific heat of the
   decomposing tires has been determined with a new methodology: instead of
   assuming constant char properties throughout pyrolysis, the specific
   heat of evolving solids (char) was evaluated with increasing temperature
   and conversion. Measured specific heat values were observed to increase
   until pyrolysis was triggered at 250 degrees C. Then, the specific heat
   of the solids decreased continuously until 400 degrees C at which point
   they started to increase. This unexpected trend pointed out that the
   exothermic peak observed with DSC is an artefact generated by the
   control system of the apparatus. To overcome this limitation, the energy
   balance was performed over industrial data and the newly found heat
   capacity values. The enthalpy of pyrolysis was found to have a term
   dependent on the weight loss derivative, with a constant value of 410
   kJ/kg tires. Two other terms for the enthalpy of pyrolysis have been
   identified, which were independent of weight loss. The first one is
   believed to correspond to the sulphur cross-link breakage at low
   temperature (65 kJ/kg), while the second one, at the final stage of
   pyrolysis, should correspond to charring reactions approaching the
   thermodynamic equilibrium (75 kJ/kg). Ultimately, this work proposes a
   new methodology to determine the enthalpy of pyrolysis with larger scale
   experimental data.}},

Title = {{Simultaneous Brain-Cervical Cord fMRI Reveals Intrinsic Spinal Cord
   Plasticity during Motor Sequence Learning}},
Journal = {{PLOS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The spinal cord participates in the execution of skilled movements by
   translating high-level cerebral motor representations into musculotopic
   commands. Yet, the extent to which motor skill acquisition relies on
   intrinsic spinal cord processes remains unknown. To date, attempts to
   address this question were limited by difficulties in separating spinal
   local effects from supraspinal influences through traditional
   electrophysiological and neuroimaging methods. Here, for the first time,
   we provide evidence for local learning-induced plasticity in intact
   human spinal cord through simultaneous functional magnetic resonance
   imaging of the brain and spinal cord during motor sequence learning.
   Specifically, we show learning-related modulation of activity in the
   C6-C8 spinal region, which is independent from that of related
   supraspinal sensorimotor structures. Moreover, a brain-spinal cord
   functional connectivity analysis demonstrates that the initial linear
   relationship between the spinal cord and sensorimotor cortex gradually
   fades away over the course of motor sequence learning, while the
   connectivity between spinal activity and cerebellum gains strength.
   These data suggest that the spinal cord not only constitutes an active
   functional component of the human motor learning network but also
   contributes distinctively from the brain to the learning process. The
   present findings open new avenues for rehabilitation of patients with
   spinal cord injuries, as they demonstrate that this part of the central
   nervous system is much more plastic than assumed before. Yet, the
   neurophysiological mechanisms underlying this intrinsic functional
   plasticity in the spinal cord warrant further investigations.}},

Abstract = {{In van Opstal et al. (Comput Mech 50:779-788, 2012) airbag inflation
   simulations were performed where the flow was approximated by Stokes
   flow. Inside the intricately folded initial geometry the Stokes
   assumption is argued to hold. This linearity assumption leads to a
   boundary-integral representation, the key to bypassing mesh generation
   and remeshing. It therefore enables very large displacements with
   near-contact. However, such a coarse assumption cannot hold throughout
   the domain, where it breaks down one needs to revert to the original
   model. The present work formalizes this idea. A model adaptive approach
   is proposed, in which the coarse model (a Stokes boundary-integral
   equation) is locally replaced by the original high-fidelity model
   (Navier-Stokes) based on a-posteriori estimates of the error in a
   quantity of interest. This adaptive modeling framework aims at taking
   away the burden and heuristics of manually partitioning the domain while
   providing new insight into the physics. We elucidate how challenges
   pertaining to model disparity can be addressed. Essentially, the
   solution in the interior of the coarse model domain is reconstructed as
   a post-processing step. We furthermore present a two-dimensional
   numerical experiments to show that the error estimator is reliable.}},

Abstract = {{Plasma polymer films are more and more used in numerous applications
   such as the day-today packaging, which requires a good mechanical
   resistance of the coating. Since mechanical properties are function of
   the cross-linking degree of the thin films, it is important to
   understand the relationship between the two. In this work, plasma
   polymer films were studied in terms of cross-linking degree and
   mechanical properties, measured by means of ToF-SIMS coupled to PCA and
   depth-sensing nanoindentation, respectively. The data reveal that when
   the power increases, the films are more cross-linked and show higher
   hardness, higher elastic recovery, lower creep strain and an increased
   ability for self-healing. As the plasma polymer films are more
   cross-linked, the plasticity drops and the viscoelasticity and hardness
   increase.}},

Abstract = {{Polymeric nanocarriers are attractive nonviral vectors for gene delivery
   purposes in vivo. For such applications, numerous physiological and
   subcellular bottlenecks have to be overcome. In that endeavor, each
   structural feature of nanocarriers can be optimized with respect to its
   corresponding challenges. Here, we focused on the interface between a
   model gene delivery nanocarrier and relevant constituents of the
   physiological environment. We screened a library of carboxymethylated
   dextrans (CMD) for the electrostatic coating of positively charged
   nanocarriers. We evaluated the jointed influence of the CMD molecular
   weight and charge density upon nanocarrier coating with respect to
   DNase, small ions, plasma proteins, red blood cells, and target cells. A
   total of 4 out of 26 CMD coated nanocarriers successfully passed every
   screening assay, but did not yield increased reporter gene expression in
   target cells compared to uncoated nanocarriers. The fine-tuning of CMD
   for nanocarrier coating yielded a relevant shortlist of candidates that
   will be further tested in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Biofunctionalization strategies have been developed to improve
   small-diameter vascular grafts. However, a fully successful coating
   featuring antithrombogenic properties while allowing for
   endothelialization has not been achieved yet. In this report, we
   explored the combination of low-fouling polyethylene glycol (PEG) and
   adhesion peptides, namely, RGD, YIGSR, and REDV, grafted on top of
   polyvinylamine (PVAm)-coated polyester. The peptides were grafted over a
   wide range of density (ca. 20-2000 pmol/cm(2)) on top of a dense PEG
   underlayer. The coating performances were assessed through HUVEC
   adhesion, platelet attachment, and protein adsorption, which were all
   drastically diminished on PEG-coated samples. RGD exhibited the expected
   high adhesive properties, toward both HUVEC and platelets. REDV had no
   effect neither on platelet attachment, as expected, nor on HUVEC
   adhesion, in contrast with previous reports. YIGSR was the most
   promising sequence even though its combination with other agents should
   be explored to further decrease thrombogenicity for vascular graft
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{In highly anthropized watersheds, surface water tributaries may carry
   unexpected high quantities of radon and radium to coastal lagoons.
   Investigating submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) with radionuclide
   tracers is therefore a complex task. In order to quantify SGD and
   decipher the influence of the different water sources, we combined a
   radon (Rn-222) and short-lived radium (Ra-223, Ra-224) survey with the
   hydrodynamic modeling of a lagoon. We applied it to the Mar Menor lagoon
   (SE Spain) where surface water tributaries and undocumented emissaries
   carry water from groundwater drainage and brines from groundwater
   desalinization. We identified the areas of influence of the plume of
   radionuclides from the river, located major areas of SGD and proposed a
   location for two submarine emissaries. Porewater, i.e. interstitial
   water from underlying sediments, was found to be the most representative
   SGD end member, compared to continental groundwater collected from
   piezometers. Mass balances in winter and summer seasons provided yearly
   SGD fluxes of water of 0.4-2.2 10(8) 3m(3)/y (Rn-222) 4.4-19.0 . 10(8)
   m(3)/y (Ra-224) and 1.3 . 10(8) m(3)/y (Ra-223, measured in winter
   only). Tidal pumping was identified as a main driver for recirculated
   saline groundwater, while fresh submarine groundwater discharge from the
   aquifer ranged between 2\% and 23\% of total SGD. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Zircon U-Pb geochronological, geochemical and petrological analyses have
   been carried out on the Xitian granite emplaced in the middle part of
   Shi-Hang zone, which is closely related to the economically important
   Xitian tungsten-tin deposit in Hunan Province, Southeast China.
   LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating of two representative samples yielded
   weighted means (206)pb/U-238 age of 151.7 +/- 1.2 Ma and 151.8 +/- 1.4
   Ma. These granites are comprised mainly of K-feldspar, quartz,
   plagioclase, Fe-rich biotite and minor fluorite, and are characterized
   by enrichments in Rb, Th, REEs (total REE = 159-351 ppm), and HFSEs
   (e.g., Zr and Y) but depletions in Ba, Sr, P, Eu and Ti. They are
   metaluminous to weakly peraluminous and show a clear A-type granite
   geochemical signature with high SiO2 (73.44-78.45 wt.\%), total alkalis
   (Na2O + K2O = 2.89-8.98 wt.\%), Fe2O3{*}/MgO ratios and low P2O5, CaO,
   MgO and TiO2 contents. In-situ zircon Hf isotope analysis suggests their
   epsilon Hf(t) values ranging from -7.43 to -14.69. Sr-Nd isotope data
   show their epsilon(Nd)(t) values in the range of -9.2 to -7.3, with
   corresponding T-DM2 ages of 1.72-1.56 Ga. These characteristics indicate
   that the Xitian granite originated from partial melting of metamorphic
   basement rocks with a certain amount of mantle-derived materials.
   Combined with previous geochemical and isotopic data, it is derived that
   mantle-crust interaction was gradually enhanced from the early to late
   stages of magmatism. The ore-forming materials and fluids of the Xitian
   W-Sn deposit are mainly produced by the Early Yanshanian granitic
   magmatism, which is also responsible for the Late Jurassic (ca. 152 Ma)
   A-type granitic rocks that host the W-Sn polymetallic deposits
   distributed along the Shi-Hang zone, implying a significant Mesozoic
   extensional event in Southeast China likely caused by the subduction of
   the Paleo-Pacific plate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Integrated in situ U-Pb dating and Hf-isotope analysis on detrital
   zircons from six sandstone samples from Hainan Island have been used to
   identify dastic sedimentary provenances, regional magmatic activity and
   crustal evolution processes. Four samples (2011XL-1,2011JB-1,09HN54 and
   2011GB-1) are from previous mapped Silurian strata and the other two
   samples (2011TD-1 and 09HN39) belong to Ordovician and Cambrian strata,
   respectively. A total of 463 concordant U-Pb zircon analyses of the six
   samples define five major age populations: 2598-2320 Ma (a peak of 2480
   Ma), 1944-1606 Ma (peak-1750 Ma), 1600-1406 Ma (peak-1502 Ma), 1288-902
   Ma (peak-957 Ma), 470-427 Ma (peak-442 Ma) and two subordinate
   populations at 898-710 Ma (peak-730 Ma) and 618-513 Ma (peak-578 Ma).
   The combination of age peaks within the samples provide a record of
   igneous activity in the source region: the 2480 Ma peak is consistent
   with those ages reported for Neoarchean global continental growth; the
   1944-1606 Ma population correlates with the time of assembly of the
   supercontinent Nuna (Columbia); the 1502 Ma peak with documented
   magmatic activity on Hainan Island; and the 1288-902 Ma and 898-710 Ma
   populations with global tectonothermal activity associated with assembly
   and breakup of Rodinia. Our data also reveal a 618-513 Ma population
   that may relate with the assembly of Gondwana. The distinctive age peak
   at 442 Ma indicates input from a region affected by the Kwangsian
   orogeny. The combined ages and Hf-isotope data for each population
   suggest that generation of juvenile crust occurred at 1900-1400 Ma,
   940-740 Ma and 470-430 Ma. Most of the other age populations that
   display negative sHf(t) values suggest reworking of older crust. (C)

Title = {{The Glasgow consensus on the delineation between pesticide emission
   inventory and impact assessment for LCA}},

Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Pesticides are applied to agricultural fields to optimise crop yield and
   their global use is substantial. Their consideration in life cycle
   assessment (LCA) is affected by important inconsistencies between the
   emission inventory and impact assessment phases of LCA. A clear
   definition of the delineation between the product system model (life
   cycle inventory-LCI, technosphere) and the natural environment (life
   cycle impact assessment-LCIA, ecosphere) is missing and could be
   established via consensus building.
   A workshop held in 2013 in Glasgow, UK, had the goal of establishing
   consensus and creating clear guidelines in the following topics: (1)
   boundary between emission inventory and impact characterisation model,
   (2) spatial dimensions and the time periods assumed for the application
   of substances to open agricultural fields or in greenhouses and (3)
   emissions to the natural environment and their potential impacts. More
   than 30 specialists in agrifood LCI, LCIA, risk assessment and
   ecotoxicology, representing industry, government and academia from 15
   countries and four continents, met to discuss and reach consensus. The
   resulting guidelines target LCA practitioners, data (base) and
   characterisation method developers, and decision makers.
   The focus was on defining a clear interface between LCI and LCIA,
   capable of supporting any goal and scope requirements while avoiding
   double counting or exclusion of important emission flows/impacts.
   Consensus was reached accordingly on distinct sets of recommendations
   for LCI and LCIA, respectively, recommending, for example, that buffer
   zones should be considered as part of the crop production system and the
   change in yield be considered. While the spatial dimensions of the field
   were not fixed, the temporal boundary between dynamic LCI fate modelling
   and steady-state LCIA fate modelling needs to be defined.
   For pesticide application, the inventory should report pesticide
   identification, crop, mass applied per active ingredient, application
   method or formulation type, presence of buffer zones, location/country,
   application time before harvest and crop growth stage during
   application, adherence with Good Agricultural Practice, and whether the
   field is considered part of the technosphere or the ecosphere.
   Additionally, emission fractions to environmental media on-field and
   off-field should be reported. For LCIA, the directly concerned impact
   categories and a list of relevant fate and exposure processes were
   identified. Next steps were identified: (1) establishing default
   emission fractions to environmental media for integration into LCI
   databases and (2) interaction among impact model developers to extend
   current methods with new elements/processes mentioned in the
   recommendations.}},

Title = {{Analysis of water use impact assessment methods (part B): applicability
   for water footprinting and decision making with a laundry case study}},

Abstract = {{The integration of different water impact assessment methods within a
   water footprinting concept is still ongoing, and a limited number of
   case studies have been published presenting a comprehensive study of all
   water-related impacts. Although industries are increasingly interested
   in assessing their water footprint beyond a simple inventory assessment,
   they often lack guidance regarding the applicability and interpretation
   of the different methods available. This paper aims to illustrate how
   different water-related methods can be applied within a water footprint
   study of a laundry detergent and discuss their applicability.
   The concept of water footprinting, as defined by the recently published
   ISO Standard (ISO 2014), is illustrated through the case study of a load
   of laundry using water availability and water degradation impact
   categories. At the midpoint, it covers scarcity, availability, and
   pollution indicators such as eutrophication, acidification, human, and
   eco-toxicity. At the endpoint, impacts on human health and ecosystems
   are covered for water deprivation and degradation. Sensitivity analyses
   are performed on the most sensitive modeling choices identified in part
   A of this paper.
   The applicability of the different methodologies and their
   interpretation within a water footprint concept for decision making is
   presented. The discussion covers general applicability issues such as
   inventory flow definition, data availability, regionalization, and
   inclusion of wastewater treatment systems. Method-specific discussion
   covers the use of interim ecotoxicity factors, the interaction of
   scarcity and availability assessments and the limits of such methods,
   and the geographic coverage and availability of impact assessment
   methods. Lastly, possible double counting, databases, software, data
   quality, and integration of a water footprint within a life cycle
   assessment (LCA) are discussed.
   This study has shown that water footprinting as proposed in the ISO
   standard can be applied to a laundry detergent product but with caveats.
   The science and the data availability are rapidly evolving, but the
   results obtained with present methods enable companies to map where in
   the life cycle and in the world impacts might occur.}},

Abstract = {{The contribution of infeasible solutions in heuristic searches for
   vehicle routing problems (VRP) is not a subject of consensus in the
   metaheuristics community. Infeasible solutions may allow transitioning
   between structurally different feasible solutions, thus enhancing the
   search, but they also lead to more complex move-evaluation procedures
   and wider search spaces. This paper introduces an experimental
   assessment of the impact of infeasible solutions on heuristic searches,
   through various empirical studies on local improvement procedures,
   iterated local searches, and hybrid genetic algorithms for the VRP with
   time windows and other related variants with fleet mix, backhauls, and
   multiple periods. Four relaxation schemes are considered, allowing
   penalized late arrivals to customers, early and late arrivals, returns
   in time, or a flexible travel time relaxation. For all considered
   problems and methods, our experiments demonstrate the significant
   positive impact of penalized infeasible solution. Differences can also
   be observed between individual relaxation schemes. The ``returns in
   time{''} and ``flexible travel time{''} relaxations appear as the best
   options in terms of solution quality, CPU time, and scalability.}},

Volume = {{141}},

Abstract = {{The self-centering energy-dissipative (SCED) brace is a new steel
   bracing member that provides both damping and recentering capability to
   a structure, while reducing or eliminating residual building
   deformations after major seismic events. Previous SCED brace designs
   exhibited full self-centering capability over frame lateral deformations
   ranging from 1.5 to 2.0\% of a typical building story height owing to
   the elongation capacity of the tendons comprising the system. To
   overcome this limitation, a new enhanced-elongation telescoping SCED
   (T-SCED) brace has been developed that allows for self-centering
   response over two times the range achieved with the original SCED
   bracing system. A prototype design of this proposed system was
   fabricated and tested quasi-statically and dynamically in a full-scale
   vertical steel frame. It exhibited full self-centering behavior in a
   single story frame that was laterally deformed to 4\% of its story
   height. This new T-SCED brace also satisfied standard testing protocols
   for buckling restrained braces. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{The effects of the addition of organically modified nanoparticles on
   molecular dynamics, and subsequently, crystallization parameters were
   investigated using temperature modulated differential scanning
   calorimetry, dynamic mechanical analysis, and rheological measurements.
   Cold crystallization was observed to occur, at higher temperatures
   compared to the pure sample, due to the formation of topological
   constraints and the increase of the rigid fraction of amorphous chains,
   trapped in the polymer-particle interphase. It was also found that in
   the nanocomposites, the competition between the heterogeneous nucleating
   role of the nanoparticles and the restricted morphology effect on
   crystallization kinetics depends on devitrification of the rigid
   amorphous chains, at the isothermal crystallization temperature, and
   during nonisothermal crystallization. It was illustrated that the
   fraction of rigid amorphous chains, extended at the crystal-amorphous
   interphase, was enhanced by the increase of the overall crystallization
   rate. Moreover, the internal structure of the crystalline domains was
   revealed through small angle X-ray scattering. A correlation function
   was applied to SAXS data to estimate the long period and the thickness
   of alternatively stacked lamellae. It was demonstrated that the long
   period depends on the overall crystallization rate, which was found to
   be influenced by nanoparticle content. In contrast, the lamellae
   thickness did not show a noticeable variation with the addition of the
   nanoparticles. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 55:1310-1320, 2015. (c) 2015 Society of

Abstract = {{Poor stormwater management is one of the primary factors behind the
   environmental degradation of water bodies. As a result, best management
   practices (BMP) and low-impact development (LID) have been implemented
   and promoted in many cities. This study presents some interesting
   results from a 1-year monitoring program for a rain garden located at a
   car park in Longueuil, Quebec, Canada (near Montreal). The design was
   specific in nature as it combines a perforated underdrain, an internal
   water storage zone of 0.97m, an almost impervious surrounding soil, and
   a flow regulator at the outlet. A monitoring program was conducted to
   assess the performance of the rain garden in warm and cold conditions.
   Inflow volumes were estimated with an SCS method using precipitation
   data, but runoff resulting from snowmelt was not monitored. Outflow
   rates were directly measured. Results from this monitoring program
   showed that the bioretention system retained 35.0\%+/- 11.6\% of the
   total runoff during the cold season, whereas 59.7\%+/- 3.3\% of the
   total runoff was retained during the warm season. The event's hydraulic
   retention efficiency depends highly on the rain garden water content at
   the beginning of the event and on the time since the previous
   precipitation event. The average event hydraulic retention efficiency
   reached 54.8\% in warm conditions and -188.8\% in cold conditions only
   for events producing outflows. The use of a vortex flow regulator at the
   outlet efficiently limited flow rates, but generated very long runoff
   events, which made the system sensitive to consecutive rainfall events.
   The water-quality monitoring activities showed that concentrations in
   Escherichia coli, fecal coliforms, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
   petroleum hydrocarbons, lead, and zinc were effectively reduced during
   the study period. The total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations were
   also well reduced by the bioretention, as average TSS concentrations in
   effluents were 4.1mg/L even in winter. However, removal of copper and
   nickel was not efficient and heavy metals concentrations were sometimes
   higher in the outlet than in the inlet. The same leaching phenomenon was
   seen for nutrients (total Kjeldahl nitrogen and phosphorous). The
   chlorides' concentration significantly increased in effluent during the
   cold season (p=0.0001) because de-icing salt was spread on the parking
   lot during winter. No clear evidence was observed that the wintry
   conditions had any effect on any other contaminants during this study
   (with a 95\% confidence level).}},

Abstract = {{13Cr4Ni martensitic stainless steels are frequently used in
   hydroelectric industries. Considering the size and geometry of the
   turbine runners manufactured in hydroelectric industries, multipass
   welding procedures are common methods for fabrication and repair. In
   this research, the microstructures and crystallographic textures of
   single-pass and double-pass welds have been studied as a first approach
   to understand a multipass weld. The highest hardness has been measured
   in the high-temperature heataffected zone (HAZ) inside the base metal.
   Similarly, it has been found that the heat of the second pass increases
   the hardness of the previous pass and produces a finer martensite
   microstructure. In areas of the HAZ, 3-6 mm from the fusion line, a
   tempering-like effect is reported; traces of austenite have also been
   found in these areas documenting the complexity of the microstructure
   found in the multipass welds.}},

Abstract = {{A superhydrophobic surface, highly water repellant and self-cleaning, is
   typically made by introducing micro-and nanoscale roughness onto the
   surface of a low surface energy material. Herein, we offer a new process
   of superhydrophobic film formation, accomplishing the same thing through
   the production of micro-and nanoscale surface porosities. Such a
   material is prepared by introducing zinc acetate (ZnAc2) and sodium
   chloride (NaCl) into a commercially available PTFE
   (polytetrafluoroethylene) emulsion. On drying, baking and washing with
   acetic acid, the PTFE film produced from the emulsion had both micro and
   nanoscale surface porosities, and demonstrated superhydrophobic
   properties, with a static contact angle > 150 degrees and a slide angle
   < 10 degrees. From SEM observation, NaCl contributes microscale
   porosity, while ZnAc2 decomposes to ZnO, contributing nanoscale
   porosity. Using either ZnAc2 or NaCl alone produces a surface with a
   static contact angle > 150 degrees, but with a slide angle > 10 degrees.
   Based on XPS and SEM data, we explore herein the affect of chemistry and
   porosity on the mechanism of superhydrophobic surface formation, and the
   durability of that surface under abrasion. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Air-conflict resolution is a bottleneck of air traffic management that
   will soon require powerful decision-aid systems to avoid the
   proliferation of delays. Since reactivity is critical for this
   application, we develop a mixed-integer linear model based on space
   discretization so that complex situations can be solved in near
   real-time. The discretization allows us to model the problem with finite
   and potentially small sets of variables and constraints by focusing on
   important points of the planned trajectories, including the points where
   trajectories intersect. A major goal of this work is to use space
   discretization while allowing velocity and heading maneuvers. Realistic
   trajectories are also ensured by considering speed vectors that are
   continuous with respect to time, and limits on the velocity,
   acceleration, and yaw rate. A classical indicator of economic efficiency
   is then optimized by minimizing a weighted sum of fuel consumption and
   delay. The experimental tests confirm that the model can solve complex
   situations within a few seconds without incurring more than a few
   kilograms of extra fuel consumption per aircraft. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

   regularization}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{281}},
Pages = {{152-168}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{We propose the vectorial additive half-quadratic (VAHQ) algorithm to
   minimize the isotropic regularized cost function with the general
   edge-preserving potential functions (PFs) in image restoration. By
   introducing an auxiliary vectorial variable, the cost function is
   changed into an augmented one which can be alternately minimized. One
   minimization is solved with an explicit expression, the other is
   implemented by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). VAHQis shown to globally
   converge to a stationary point for nonconvex PFs providing all
   stationary points are isolated and to a unique minimum for convex PFs
   without any isolation assumption, on an extended domain of parameters.
   What is more, the linear convergence rate of VAHQ is proved to be less
   than 1, the explicit expression of the optimal parameters and the
   optimal bound of the convergence rate are present for convex PFs. Image
   restoration examples show the restoration performance of nonconvex PFs,
   the lower computation cost of our algorithm compared to
   Majorize-Minimize memory gradient (MMMG) algorithm with the help of FFT
   and some interesting phenomena confirming our conclusions on the
   convergence domain and the convergence rate. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Critical assessment of influenza VLP production in Sf9 and HEK293
   expression systems}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{MAY 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: Each year, influenza is responsible for hundreds of thousand
   cases of illness and deaths worldwide. Due to the virus' fast mutation
   rate, the World Health Organization (WHO) is constantly on alert to
   rapidly respond to emerging pandemic strains. Although anti-viral
   therapies exist, the most proficient way to stop the spread of disease
   is through vaccination. The majority of influenza vaccines on the market
   are produced in embryonic hen's eggs and are composed of purified viral
   antigens from inactivated whole virus. This manufacturing system,
   however, is limited in its production capacity. Cell culture produced
   vaccines have been proposed for their potential to overcome the problems
   associated with egg-based production. Virus-like particles (VLPs) of
   influenza virus are promising candidate vaccines under consideration by
   both academic and industry researchers.
   Methods: In this study, VLPs were produced in HEK293 suspension cells
   using the Bacmam transduction system and Sf9 cells using the baculovirus
   infection system. The proposed systems were assessed for their ability
   to produce influenza VLPs composed of Hemagglutinin (HA), Neuraminidase
   (NA) and Matrix Protein (M1) and compared through the lens of
   bioprocessing by highlighting baseline production yields and
   bioactivity. VLPs from both systems were characterized using available
   influenza quantification techniques, such as single radial
   immunodiffusion assay (SRID), HA assay, western blot and negative
   staining transmission electron microscopy (NSTEM) to quantify total
   particles.
   Results: For the HEK293 production system, VLPs were found to be
   associated with the cell pellet in addition to those released in the
   supernatant. Sf9 cells produced 35 times more VLPs than HEK293 cells.
   Sf9-VLPs had higher total HA activity and were generally more
   homogeneous in morphology and size. However, Sf9 VLP samples contained
   20 times more baculovirus than VLPs, whereas 293 VLPs were produced
   along with vesicles.
   Conclusions: This study highlights key production hurdles that must be
   overcome in both expression platforms, namely the presence of
   contaminants and the ensuing quantification challenges, and brings up
   the question of what truly constitutes an influenza VLP candidate
   vaccine.}},

Abstract = {{The novel designed Jiggle Bed Reactor (JBR) was utilized to investigate
   thermal and catalytic gasification of bio-oils (without excess steam)
   with respect to carbon conversion and syngas (H-2 + CO) yield. Two
   commercial nickel based steam reforming catalysts (X and Y) were used.
   Beside its convenient and economical operation, the JBR was capable to
   be accurately and promisingly responsive to change in operating
   conditions. The catalyst X gave better results in terms of carbon
   conversion of bio-oils and hydrogen yield at 800 degrees C. Catalytic
   experiments showed that increasing the temperature decreased the molar
   H-2/CO ratio because of a lack of steam, while it increased the carbon
   conversion. Therefore, either steam should be added to the gasification
   reactor or a secondary water gas shift reactor should be used downstream
   of the gasification reactor to maximize the H-2/CO ratio. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{In this research, forward and backward isotropic finite differences for
   the gradient operator are developed up to fourth order. Isotropic
   gradients are characterized by error terms which have small directional
   preference. Currently, only centred finite differences are available for
   isotropic discretization in the scientific literature; however, these
   finite differences are not suited for evaluation on domain boundaries or
   at multilevel lattice interfaces. We show that the order of accuracy
   with respect to the gradient direction with isotropic discretizations
   can be higher in some situations, and, at the same time, use neighbours
   that are closer to the evaluation point than with standard
   discretizations. The isotropic discretizations presented here were
   developed for a special rectangular lattice formulation, and general
   stencil weights are provided. When the rectangular lattice has a certain
   aspect ratio, forward and backward isotropic gradients can be obtained
   on a square lattice.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a new vehicle routing problem class in which customers are
   divided into a number of customer zones defined through geographical or
   timing characteristics. The customers of each of these zones must be
   serviced within time windows by dedicated routes originating at
   associated supply points characterized by hard time windows and very
   limited waiting facilities, if any. A key feature of the problem is that
   a vehicle can be used to cover routes in different zones at different
   times. The objective is to minimize the total transportation cost to
   ensure that the customers are serviced on time and that vehicles arrive
   at the next customer zone just in time for the next assignment. The
   problem is addressed by a decomposition-based heuristic. Lower-bound
   procedures and benchmark problem instances are introduced, highlighting
   the satisfactory performance of the heuristic. Finally, a wide range of
   sensitivity analyses on several key parameters reveal interesting facets
   of the behavior of this new problem class.}},

Abstract = {{It is difficult to obtain a reliable water-retention curve (WRC) for
   coarse-grained soils without organic matter. As a result, the field
   behavior of draining layers in engineering problems may be poorly
   predicted. The main goal of this paper is to develop predictive methods
   for the WRC of coarse-grained soils based on long-column, long-duration
   drainage test data and available soil properties. The paper first shows
   that predictive models perform poorly for coarse-grained soils, but four
   descriptive models can correctly fit the test data. Second, it provides
   predictive equations for the air-entry value (AEV), residual suction
   u(p), and residual water content theta(r) as simple functions of the
   effective size d(10) and void ratio e. Third, it provides new formulas
   that relate d10 and e to the parameters of descriptive models; thus,
   enabling them to become very simple to use predictive models for ed(10)
   > 0.05 mm. The paper finally shows that small variations in d10 and e
   have more influence on the saturated permeability than on the WRC
   parameters.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ERGONOMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{1-8}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The 1991 NIOSH Lifting Equation (NLE) is widely used to assess the risk
   of injury to spine by providing estimates of the recommended weight
   limit (RWL) in hands. The present study uses the predictive equations
   developed based on a detailed trunk musculoskeletal biomechanical model
   to verify whether the RWL generates L5-S1 loads within the limits (e.g.,
   3400 N for compression recommended by NIOSH and 1000 N for shear
   recommended in some studies). Fifty lifting activities are simulated
   here to evaluate the RWL by the NLE and the L5-S1 loads by the
   predictive equations. In lifting activities involving moderate to large
   forward trunk flexion, the estimated RWL generates L5-S1 spine loads
   exceeding the recommended limits. The NIOSH vertical multiplier is the
   likely cause of this inadequacy; a revised multiplier accounting for the
   trunk flexion angle is hence needed. The use of a fixed 3400 N
   compression limit is also questioned.
   Relevance to industry: Ergonomist and occupational health practitioners
   are advised to use the NLE along with the predictive equations of the
   spine loads proposed in this study when evaluating the risk of injury to
   the spine in lifting activities particularly those involving moderate to
   large trunk flexion. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{97}},
Pages = {{9-17}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Oil-in-water Pickering emulsions were prepared using a standard mixing
   configuration. Emulsification experiments were performed in an unbaffled
   tank using an off-centered pitched-blade turbine. Regular and modified
   glass beads were used as,a stabilizer, and their size, concentration,
   and wettability effects were investigated as were oil viscosity and the
   properties of the aqueous phase (pH and salinity). Our findings
   highlighted the importance of the stabilization mechanism in the
   emulsification process, which is different from that of surfactant-based
   systems. The stabilization mechanism can be divided into four steps: (1)
   droplet formation by breakage, (2) particle/droplet approach and
   collision, (3) particle adsorption, and (4) formation of the particle
   network. Emulsification efficiency was mainly quantified by size
   distribution measurements using a Mastersizer 3000 (Malvern). Our
   results showed that droplet stabilization is closely related to
   particle/droplet approach, collision, and initial adsorption and that it
   is highly sensitive to oil viscosity and particle size and wettability,
   while the properties of the aqueous phase influence stabilization mainly
   through their effect on particle interactions (flocculation). The
   smallest droplets with the narrowest distribution were obtained with
   small particles, low Oil viscosities, and good oil/particle affinity. It
   was possible to modulate the effects of particle size and oil viscosity
   by increasing oil/particle affinity. We also showed that stabilization
   efficiency is dependent on the particle fraction. (C) 2015 The

Journal = {{POLYMER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{112-121}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the deposition of a homogeneous chitosan layer on the
   surface of a 3D interconnected porous network of
   poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL), prepared from a co-continuous polymer
   blend of PCL/PEO (poly(-ethylene oxide)), was achieved. A Layer-by-Layer
   (LbL) self-assembly of polyelectrolytes (PDADMAC as polycation and PSS
   as polyanion) followed by chitosan deposition was compared with a
   traditional dip-coating strategy of chitosan on pure PCL surfaces.
   According to gravimetric measurements for the LBL technique, few layer
   depositions lead to an interpenetration of polyelectrolyte molecule
   chains, however upon increasing the number of layers, more well defined
   layers are formed. The oxygen/carbon, nitrogen/carbon and sulfur/carbon
   ratios determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on 2D solid
   discs clearly showed that the PSS molecule dominated the surface as the
   last deposited layer at higher number of depositions (n = 8). The
   further addition of chitosan by LbL was demonstrated to be superior as
   compared to the dip-coating technique since uniform local deposition of
   chitosan on the LbL coating was observed in both 2D solid discs and 3D
   porous cubes at various depths within the scaffolds. SEM imaging shows
   the multilayer assembly ranges in thickness from 550 to 700 nm. These
   data demonstrate that the LbL technique of polyelectrolyte deposition
   followed by chitosan addition provides a route towards stable and
   homogeneous surface modification and has the potential to transform a
   classic fully interconnected porous synthetic polymer material to one
   with essentially complete chitosan-like surface characteristics. (C)

Abstract = {{A novel mini induction heating fluidized bed reactor (IHFBR) is
   introduced which was developed to carry out screening tests of high
   temperature reactions up to 1500 degrees C particularly for solid
   feedstocks. Despite conventional mini reactors, this reactor mimics real
   scenario of solid feeding in industrial reactors: cold feedstock is
   injected within 1 s from a lift tube, then particles reach reaction
   temperature in less than 5 s in a reaction zone. The lift tube (9.5 cm
   diameter) is also the gas distributor of the fluidized bed (2.5 cm
   diameter) so that the bed is completely fluidized with uniform gas
   distribution. Beside facilities to perform tests in a fluidized bed,
   another important feature of this reactor is prediction of the
   defluidization state in the bed. Not only reproducible data are
   generated, but also many tests can be conveniently carried out, that is,
   one test per hour. (c) 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

Title = {{A New Formulation Based on Customer Delivery Patterns for a Maritime
   Inventory Routing Problem}},

Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we address a maritime inventory routing problem
   encountered by one of the world's largest producers of liquefied natural
   gas (LNG). The producer is responsible for the LNG inventories at the
   liquefaction plant, the loading port with a limited number of berths,
   and the routing and scheduling of a heterogeneous fleet of LNG ships. In
   addition, the producer has to fulfill a set of long-term contracts to
   customers all around the world. The producer's goal is to create a
   minimum-cost long-term delivery program that respects the long-term
   contracts while maximizing revenue from selling LNG in the spot market.
   We introduce a new formulation for this problem arising from a novel
   decomposition scheme based on delivery patterns. To solve this
   formulation, we develop an exact branch-price-and-cut algorithm.
   Computational results show that this new formulation provides much
   tighter lower bounds than the only known mixed integer programming (MIP)
   formulation for this problem. Furthermore, on a set of 27 benchmark
   instances, the proposed branch-price-and-cut method clearly outperforms
   a commercial MIP solver applied to the existing MIP model.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the compensation of cutting process related errors
   in order to improve the accuracy of manufactured parts. The compensation
   is a modification of the tool dimension and the tool path using
   on-machine probing data. A cutting depth distribution-based approach is
   proposed to calibrate the cutting process according to the on-machine
   probed error model. This approach is investigated in cases of both rigid
   and compliant parts. The calibration offset is estimated for the actual
   cutting conditions with and without a fitting process. In the case
   study, the offset varies from 12 to 17 mu m for down milling at 6000 rpm
   spindle speed. The impact of the cutting speed is investigated. A
   rectangular profile was machined with and without compensation in down
   and up milling mode. The results show that the proposed approach is
   effective. The error is reduced from a maximum of 25 mu m for down
   milling and 10 mu m for up milling to 4 mu m in both cases.}},

   complexity of the structure. Convergence is rapid. It is not necessary
   to choose a large number of elements to obtain good results. The results
   are validated using numerical and theoretical data available in the

   efficiently for design and analysis of spherical shells employed in high

Title = {{Consensus building on the development of a stress-based indicator for
   LCA-based impact assessment of water consumption: outcome of the expert
   workshops}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The WULCA group, active since 2007 on Water Use in LCA, commenced the
   development of consensus-based indicators in January 2014. This activity
   is planned to last 2 years and covers human health, ecosystem quality,
   and a stress-based indicator. This latter encompasses potential
   deprivation of both ecosystem and human, hence aiming to represent
   potential impacts more comprehensively than any other available
   LCA-oriented method assessing the ``water scarcity footprint{''} (ISO
   2014).
   A series of three expert workshops, including non-LCA experts from
   hydrology, eco-hydrology, and water supply science, was organized
   specifically on the topic of this generic midpoint indicator. They were
   held in Zurich on 10th September, in San Francisco on 5th October and in
   Tsukuba on 27th October 2014. In total 49 experts attended. The specific
   objectives of the workshops were twofold. First, it was to present the
   identified options of the stress-based indicator narrowed down by the
   active members of WULCA during the first 8 months of the project and to
   receive comments on the relevance, usefulness, acceptability, and focus
   of the selected indicator. Second, the workshop covered different
   challenges in the modeling of the indicator and presented the experts
   with background information and specific questions. This paper
   summarizes the discussions and outcome of these workshops. Where no
   agreement was reached, the working group of active members is
   considering all inputs received and continues the work.
   The discussion covered first the question to be answered by such
   indicator, resulting on an agreement on the evaluation of the potential
   to deprive other users of water, independently of who the user is (i.e.,
   human or ecosystems). Special attention was given to the special case of
   arid areas as well as the definition of environmental water
   requirements. Specific modeling challenges were then addressed:
   definition and quantification of human and ecosystem water demand,
   consideration of green water and terrestrial ecosystems, sources of
   data, distinction of groundwater and surface water, and temporal and
   geographical resolution.
   The input, decisions, and points of discussion were compiled and brought
   back within the group of active members. The group is using the
   recommendations and works further on the harmonization of the points of
   disagreement. It is expected that a selection of indicators representing
   different ways to address the most important issues will be produced and
   tested in spring 2015. The analysis of the result should lead to a
   provisional recommendation by summer 2015.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},

Abstract = {{The importance of integrating resources criticality assessment into Life
   Cycle Assessment (LCA) under the Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment
   (LCSA) framework has been discussed for some time. However, the question
   how to proceed towards integration remain unclear. Only very few work is
   published on this issue and to our knowledge only Schneider et al.
   (2014) have developed one operational model. In this paper we review
   existing literature critically and explain why integration is important
   and how it could be done, using knowledge from outside the LCA field.
   The criticality assessment method proposed by Graedel et al. (2012) is
   identified as the best starting point. This paper shows based on a
   critical review why bridging towards such a method could help addressing
   criticality in LCSA, what are possible options and which research needs
   exists. It reveals that currently LCA does not adequately cover resource
   criticality and that methods like Graedel et al. (2012) are inspiring
   further development of LCA; both approaches have a complementary nature
   and hence could be developed towards integration within the LCSA
   framework. Currently resource indicators are not meaningful in LCA,
   wherefore there is no consensus in LCA community on what to recommend;
   hence the Area of Protection Natural Resources needs to be rethought.
   Broadening the scope of LCA towards LCSA provides a conceptual framework
   to keep LCA relevant for assessing sustainability challenges like access
   to resources. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The interfacial self-adhesion strength of polyethylene (PE) binary
   blends in temperatures higher than the melting point was investigated in
   relation to their components' structures and elongational rheological
   properties. Four binary blends were prepared from the combination of a
   conventional polyethylene; LDPE or Ziegler-Natta LLDPE, with a
   metallocene catalyzed ethylene alpha-olefin copolymer; linear (Linear-m)
   or long chain branched (LCB-m). Interfacial adhesion was carried out by
   bringing two films into intimate contact under slight pressure and heat
   for 0.5 s. Adhesion strength was then measured by peeling immediately
   after sealing while the adherents were still in the molten state.
   Blending metallocene in 20, 40, and 60 wt\% compositions with
   conventional PEs enhanced the self-adhesion. However, the adhesion
   strength of the blends containing 60 wt\% metallocene resins was
   significantly lower than the adhesion strength of neat metallocene
   resins. This was interpreted to be due to the formation of a segregated
   layer of highly branched short chains of LDPE or Zn-LLDPE at the surface
   of films. The increase in adhesion strength of LDPE/Linear-m and
   Zn-LLDPE/Linear-m blends was more than LDPE/LCB-m and Zn-LLDPE/LCB-m
   blends. This was attributed to the faster reptation of linear chains,
   hence superior diffusion across the interface compared to LCB containing
   resin. The higher increase of adhesion strength for all compositions of
   LDPE blends was observed compared to their Zn-LLDPE counterparts. The
   temperature range in which the film showed a plateau of its highest
   adhesion strength was determined for all blend compositions. The results
   indicated that the temperature window of plateau adhesion strength for
   LDPE blends were broader than their Zn-LLDPE counterparts. Therefore,
   this work suggests that the final plateau temperature (T (pf) ) can be
   correlated with the area under stress-strain curve of the extensional
   rheological measurements, which is called toughness. Then, the higher
   melt toughness can result in a broader adhesion strength plateau.}},

Abstract = {{This paper, presents evaluation and analysis of the performance for
   multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) schemes in the 3GPP long term

   and average throughput of the system for two different MIMO schemes as
   defined in LTE. Using the numerical results obtained from the
   mathematical expressions derived in the paper, we compare the presented
   schemes and show their significant advantages. Monte-Carlo simulation
   results of the LTE system are also provided to verify the accuracy of
   the mathematical analysis. The results for the average throughput of the
   considered MIMO schemes in LTE are presented for the un-coded case as
   well as for the coded-case in practical LTE scenarios. In addition, for
   the sake of comparison, the theoretical capacity limit of the system is

Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-23}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The mesh adaptive direct search (Mads) algorithm is designed for
   blackbox optimization problems subject to general inequality
   constraints. Currently, Mads does not support equalities, neither in
   theory nor in practice. The present work proposes extensions to treat
   problems with linear equalities whose expression is known. The main idea
   consists in reformulating the optimization problem into an equivalent
   problem without equalities and possibly fewer optimization variables.
   Several such reformulations are proposed, involving orthogonal
   projections, QR or SVD decompositions, as well as simplex decompositions
   into basic and nonbasic variables. All of these strategies are studied
   within a unified convergence analysis, guaranteeing Clarke stationarity
   under mild conditions provided by a new result on the hypertangent cone.
   Numerical results on a subset of the CUTEst collection are reported.}},

Abstract = {{We propose an approach for goal-oriented error estimation in finite
   element approximations of second-order elliptic problems that combines
   the dual-weighted residual method and equilibrated-flux reconstruction
   methods for the primal and dual problems. The objective is to be able to
   consider discretization schemes for the dual solution that may be
   different from those used for the primal solution. It is only assumed
   here that the discretization methods come with a priori error estimates
   and an equilibrated-flux reconstruction algorithm. A high-order
   discontinuous Galerkin (dG) method is actually the preferred choice for
   the approximation of the dual solution thanks to its flexibility and
   straightforward construction of equilibrated fluxes. One contribution of
   the paper is to show how the order of the dG method for asymptotic
   exactness of the proposed estimator can be chosen in the cases where a
   conforming finite element method, a dG method, or a mixed Raviart-Thomas
   method is used for the solution of the primal problem. Numerical
   experiments are also presented to illustrate the performance and
   convergence of the error estimates in quantities of interest with
   respect to the mesh size. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{84}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a numerical study of natural convection in a vertical
   enclosure filled with a non-Newtonian fluid. Thermal boundary conditions
   of the Neumann type are applied on the vertical walls of the enclosure
   while the horizontal ones are assumed adiabatic. A Carreau-Yasuda model,
   adequate for many non-Newtonian fluids, is used to characterize the
   behavior of the shear thinning fluids. The governing parameters for the
   problem are the thermal Rayleigh number Ra, Prandtl number Pr, power-law
   index n, aspect ratio A and parameters of non-Newtonian fluid model. A
   semi-analytical solution, valid for an infinite layer (A 1), is derived
   on the basis of the parallel flow approximation. The influence of the
   constitutive Carreau-Yasuda equation parameters on the fluid flow,
   temperature field and heat transfer is discussed in detail. A good
   agreement is found between the predictions of the parallel flow
   approximation and the numerical results obtained by solving the full
   governing equations. The results reveal the strong influence of the
   pseudoplastic behavior of a non-Newtonian fluid on its natural
   convection heat transfer within the enclosure. Results are also obtained
   by considering the same phenomenon on the basis of the power law model.
   A comparison is made between the predictions of the two rheological
   models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{POWDER TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{275}},
Pages = {{39-50}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This study reports a computational particle fluid dynamics model for the
   numerical simulation of a sand fluidized bed with 8 wt.\% and 16 wt.\%
   biomass loadings. The proposed CPFD model, based on a Barracuda
   framework, is validated using experimental data obtained in a 15.2 cm
   diameter bed with a 22.5 cm static height. This fluidized bed unit is
   equipped with a pair of fiber optic sensors allowing one to obtain both
   the bubble size and bubble velocity frequency distributions in an ample
   range of experimental conditions. In addition to this, the first-,
   second-, and third-order statistical moments of the bubble size and the
   bubble velocity distributions are calculated for each one of the
   operating conditions studied. On this basis, the present study
   demonstrates that the proposed CPFD model reproduces the asymmetric
   character of both bubble size and bubble velocity distributions. In
   addition, the simulated and experimental bubble size and bubble velocity
   distributions yield close first-, second-, and third-order statistical
   moments. Accordingly, one can ascertain that the proposed CPFD model is
   quite satisfactory for establishing fluid flow patterns in sand-biomass
   fluidized bed gasifiers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Different lifting analysis tools are commonly used to assess spinal
   loads and risk of injury. Distinct musculoskeletal models with various
   degrees of accuracy are employed in these tools affecting thus their
   relative accuracy in practical applications. The present study aims to
   compare predictions of six tools (HCBCF, LSBM, 3DSSPP, AnyBody, simple
   polynomial, and regression models) for the L4-L5 and L5-S1 compression
   and shear loads in twenty-six static activities with and without hand
   load. Significantly different spinal loads but relatively similar
   patterns for the compression (R-2 > 0.87) were computed. Regression
   models and AnyBody predicted intradiscal pressures in closer agreement
   with available in vivo measurements (RMSE approximate to 0.12 MPa). Due
   to the differences in predicted spinal loads, the estimated risk of
   injury alters depending on the tool used. Each tool is evaluated to
   identify its shortcomings and preferred application domains. (c) 2014

Abstract = {{In coordinate metrology parts can be inspected in contact and
   non-contact ways. Accuracy of points from contact measurements is high
   but long measuring time occurs. In optical measurements data from the
   whole object is gathered in a short time. Unfortunately accuracy of this
   data is lower. As both contact and non-contact measuring methods have
   their pros and cons, combining the two using data fusion may overcome
   their respective limitations and drawbacks. In this paper a method for
   fusion of data from two measurements of fundamentally different nature:
   high definition high uncertainty (HDHU) and low definition low
   uncertainty (LDLU) is presented. In this method material markers were
   used as a representation of characteristic points. The positions of
   these points were determined by both methods of points collection. Then
   transformation enabling displacement of characteristic points from
   optical measurement to their match from contact measurements was
   determined and was applied to the whole point cloud. The efficiency of
   the proposed algorithm was evaluated by comparison with data from a
   coordinate measuring machine (CMM). First, to simplify the evaluation as
   an artefact, a plane was used. It was shown that the proposed algorithm
   generally decreased the mean difference between the adjusted point cloud
   and data from the CMM. For the analysed sections, improvements of
   average distances are between 30\% and 95\%. The proposed algorithm was
   also used for data from measurements of freeform surfaces from a turbine
   blade and an engine cover. The obtained improvement of measuring data
   accuracy was up to 25\% of the accuracy of non-contact data from a laser
   scanner on a measuring arm. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, integrated models of facility location and network design
   (FLND) problems have attracted many research attentions. This class of
   NP-hard problems, as the name suggests, simultaneously optimizes
   facility locations and the design of the underlying network. They have
   been a central and useful planning tool in many contexts, e.g., regional
   planning, distribution, energy management, etc. However, FLND problems
   are extremely hard to solve and computational difficulties has limited
   their way into the practice. In this paper, we propose three variants of
   a simple and efficient meta-heuristic based on variable neighborhood
   search method to solve the capacitated FLND problem effectively. We
   particularly improve the neighborhood exploration mechanism by taking
   advantage of exact methods within the solution framework. Computational
   experiments on a wide-range of test instances with up to 100 nodes and
   600 links show that our approaches consistently return high quality
   solutions in short CPU times in comparison with the state-of-the-art of
   commercial solvers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an agent-based simulation model to study and analyse
   the performance of various procurement and production policies in the
   recycled paper industry. The proposed model includes the recycled pulp
   production process, as well as the waste paper inventory and procurement
   processes. A detailed simulation model developed in partnership with a
   large recycled pulp producer in North America was developed in order to
   emulate the procurement manager's behaviour. Therefore, based on the
   observed behaviour of the procurement manager, a procurement behaviour
   model, which takes both market price and inventory requirement into
   account, is introduced. This paper also introduces a waste paper market
   model that simulates a market price and enables the control of price
   forecast accuracy. Two series of experiments were carried out in order
   to study the performance of procurement and production policies in
   several productions contexts. Results show that production Volume
   Flexibility has a negative impact on costs, inventory and quality.
   However, it is possible to partially reduce these issues with the
   introduction of contracts with Volume Flexibility, although only a
   limited effect has been observed in our experiments. A more significant
   strategy to improve costs consists in reducing production rate to the
   minimum level required to meet demand. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We address a generalization of the asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem
   where routes have to be constructed to satisfy customer requests, which
   either involve the pickup or delivery of a single commodity. A vehicle
   is to be routed such that the demand and the supply of the customers is
   satisfied under the objective to minimize the total distance traveled.
   The commodities which are collected from the pickup customers can be
   used to accommodate the demand of the delivery customers. In this paper,
   we present three mathematical formulations for this problem class and
   apply branch-and-cut algorithms to optimally solve the model
   formulations. For two of the models we derive Benders cuts based on the
   classical and the generalized Benders decomposition. Finally, we analyze
   the different mathematical formulations and associated solution
   approaches on well-known data sets from the literature. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The physicochemical properties and potential cytotoxicity of
   nanoparticles (NPs) are significantly influenced by their interaction
   with proteins, which results in corona formation. Here, we have
   determined whether corona formation, resulting from interactions between
   superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) and different cell
   culture media, may have consequences for driving NP toxic effects. To
   address this issue, complementary methods were used. The determination
   of the hydrodynamic size distribution by zeta (zeta) potential
   measurement indicated that SPIONs were negatively charged under all
   conditions but that the actual charge was differed with the cell culture
   medium used. In vitro protein adsorption studies were carried out using
   the Bradford protein assay and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
   (FTIR). The Bradford assay revealed that the concentration of unadsorbed
   proteins and other biomolecules decreased when the SPION concentration
   increased. FTIR showed that the proteins were, indeed, adsorbed onto the
   NP surface. This was followed by matrix-assisted laser
   desorption/ionization time-of-flightsecondary ion mass spectrometry
   (MALDI TOF-SIMS), to identify the adsorbed proteins. Ultimately, three
   different cell viability assays led to the conclusion that the SPIONs
   were not toxic for all the concentrations used here. In summary, we
   found that corona formation on the SPIONs depends on the composition of
   the culture media but has no consequence for nanotoxicity. We have shown
   that the application of complementary methods has provided novel
   insights into SPION/protein interactions.}},

Abstract = {{A substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW) broadband phase shifter is

   synthesis of an artificial dielectric slab using an array of metallic

   within a compact size and enhances the density of integration. As an
   example, 45 degrees and 90 degrees phase shifters are designed and
   showcased on a single-layer substrate at a centre frequency of 26 GHz.
   The amplitude imbalance between the two paths is also avoided while the
   phase error is less than 5 degrees over a frequency band of 20-32 GHz or
   around 46\% relative bandwidth. The measured return loss is found to be
   better than 12 dB over the whole frequency band.}},

   fictitious velocities via lattice refinement is proposed, which is based
   on interface thickness control for which both the spurious currents and
   the physical fluid-fluid interface thickness vanishes as the spatial
   resolution increases. It has been found that a proper interface
   thickness adjustment is required as the lattice refinement is applied,
   or an increase in spurious currents, instead of a reduction, can occur.
   By combining the new method with an appropriate multiphase flow
   initialization, the overall stability for high density O(1000) and
   viscosity O(100) ratios is greatly improved. Although this research has
   been conducted with a Rothman and Keller type lattice Boltzmann model,
   it is believed that other types of multiphase lattice Boltzmann models
   could benefit from the basic ideas underlying this research. Copyright

Title = {{High-order time integrators for front-tracking finite-element analysis

Abstract = {{This paper proposes implicit Runge-Kutta (IRK) time integrators to
   improve the accuracy of a front-tracking finite-element method for
   viscous free-surface flow predictions. In the front-tracking approach,
   the modeling equations must be solved on a moving domain, which is
   usually performed using an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) frame of
   reference. One of the main difficulties associated with the ALE
   formulation is related to the accuracy of the time integration
   procedure. Indeed, most formulations reported in the literature are
   limited to second-order accurate time integrators at best. In this
   paper, we present a finite-element ALE formulation in which a consistent
   evaluation of the mesh velocity and its divergence guarantees
   satisfaction of the discrete geometrical conservation law. More
   importantly, it also ensures that the high-order fixed mesh temporal
   accuracy of time integrators is preserved on deforming grids. It is
   combined with the use of a family of L-stable IRK time integrators for
   the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations to yield high-order
   time-accurate free-surface simulations. This is demonstrated in the
   paper using the method of manufactured solution in space and time as
   recommended in Verification and Validation. In particular, we report up
   to fifth-order accuracy in time. The proposed free-surface
   front-tracking approach is then validated against cases of practical
   interest such as sloshing in a tank, solitary waves propagation, and
   coupled interaction between a wave and a submerged cylinder. Copyright

Abstract = {{In this study, we propose a queueing model to analyse the performance of
   an opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) system with service interruptions
   operating over heterogeneous channels in which the service transmission
   rate and the service interruption rate after the transmission is resumed
   are generally different than their value prior to the interruption. We
   first propose Markov chain models to analyse this system under
   memoryless service time and availability periods. On the basis of
   simplification assumptions, we also provide an analytical z-Transform
   analysis of the Markov models. The Markov model and approximations are
   validated with accurate system simulations. We also provide numerical
   results illustrating the non-convex relations between the traffic
   metrics and system parameters and that the proposed models are essential
   for optimal OSA network planning and operation. We further analyse and
   discuss the OSA queueing model for general distribution of service time
   and availability periods. The analytical and simulation results indicate
   that for usual system parameters, the queue average occupancy is similar
   for different distributions of service time and availability periods and
   that the memoryless Markov models can be used to accurately predict the
   heterogeneous OSA system traffic performance.}},

Title = {{Tailoring the mechanical and tribological properties of sputtered boron
   carbide films via the B1-xCx composition}},
Journal = {{SURFACE \& COATINGS TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{267}},
Pages = {{2-7}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Boron carbide films are very attractive due to their high hardness and
   interesting tribological properties. In the present work, the
   compositional effect of boron carbide B1 - xCx (0 < x < 1) films is
   systematically studied to tailor mechanical, tribological and corrosion
   properties of the films. The B1 - xCx layers were deposited on Si (100)
   and M2 high speed steel substrates using a pilot-scale closed-field
   unbalanced magnetron sputtering system equipped with one graphite and
   two boron targets. Different compositions were obtained by tuning the
   electrical power applied to the graphite target. The hardness of the B1
   - xCx films decreases from 28 to 20 GPa as the carbon content {[}C]
   rises from 19 to 56 at.\%, but thereafter it increases again up to -25
   GPa when {[}C] reaches 76 at.\%. The hardness variation is explained by
   changes in the film microstructure, namely formation of either a
   nanoaystalline boron carbide in the case of boron-rich films, or boron
   carbide nanocrystals dispersed in an amorphous boron carbide/a-C matrix
   in the case of carbon-rich films as deduced from the combined XPS,
   micro-Raman and XRD measurements. The friction coefficient of the B1 -
   xCx films reduces from 0.66 to 0.13, and the wear rate against alumina
   ball drops from 6.4 x 10(-5) mm(3)/Nm to 13 x 10(-7) mm(3)/Nm with
   increasing the {[}C]. Raman analyses indicate that improvement of the
   tribological properties of the B1 - xCx films is primarily caused by the
   presence of the amorphous carbon phase that leads to the formation of a
   graphitic tribolayer acting as a solid lubricant during the wear
   process. Deposition of the B0.81C0.19 film with high hardness (28 GPa)
   improves the corrosion resistance of the M2 steel substrate by four
   orders of magnitude, documented by the decrease of the corrosion current
   from 3 x 10(-6) A/cm(2) to 8 x 10(-10) A/cm(2). We demonstrate that
   adjustment of the x-portion in the B1 - xCx system allows one to tailor
   the tribo-mechanical properties over a large range from high
   hardness/high friction to high hardness/low friction structures. (C)

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{204-215}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Intense accumulation of toxic cyanobacteria cells inside plants,
   unsuccessful removal of cells and consequent breakthrough of cells and
   toxins into treated water have been increasingly documented. Removal or
   destabilisation of cells in the pre-treatment stage using pre-ozonation
   could be an efficient practice as ozonation has been proven to be
   effective for the removal of cells and toxins. However, several unknowns
   including the ozone demand, the potential release of cell-bound toxins
   and organic matter and their impact on treatment train needs to be
   addressed. The general objective of this work was to study the impact of
   direct ozonation on different potentially toxic cyanobacteria genera
   from natural blooms. Water samples from five cyanobacterial bloom events
   in Lake Champlain (Canada) were ozonated using 2-5 mg/L O-3 for a
   contact time of maximum 10 min. Cyanobacterial taxonomic enumeration,
   cyanotoxins, organic matter and post-chlorination disinfection
   by-product formation potential analyses were conducted on all samples.
   Anabaena, Aphanizomenon, Microcystis and Pseudanabaena were detected in
   bloom water samples. Total cell numbers varied between 197,000 and
   1,282,000 cells/mL prior to ozonation. Direct ozonation lysed (reduction
   in total cell numbers) 41\%-80\% of cells and reduced released toxins to
   below detection limits. Microcystis was the genus the least affected by
   ozonation. However, DOC releases of 0.6-3.5 mg/L were observed leading
   to maximum 86.92 mu g/L and 61.56 mu g/L additional total THMs (four
   trihalomethanes) and HAA(6) (six haloacetic acids) formation,
   respectively. The results of this study demonstrate that vigilant
   application of pre-ozonation under certain treatment conditions would
   help to avoid extreme toxic cells accumulation within water treatment
   plants. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, bubbling fluidization of a sand fluidized bed with
   different biomass loadings are investigated by means of the experiments
   and numerical simulation. The radioactive particle {[}racking (RPT)
   technique is employed to explore the impact of the particle shape factor
   on the biomass distribution and velocity profiles when it is fluidized
   in a 152 mm diameter bed with a 228 mm static height. Using a pair of
   fiber optic sensors, the bubbling characteristics of these mixtures at
   the upper half of the dense bed are determined at superficial gas
   velocities ranging from U=0.2 m/s to U=1.0 m/s. The experimental results
   show that despite cycling with a similar frequency, spherical biomass
   particles rise faster and sink slower than the cylindrical biomass
   particles. Furthermore, bubbles are more prone to break in the presence
   of biomass particles with lower sphericity. In the separate series of
   experiments, the reliability of the ``frozen bed{''} technique to
   quantify the axial distribution of biomass particles is assessed by the
   RPT results. Using NEPTUNE\_CFD software, three-dimensional numerical
   simulations are carried out via an Eulerian n-fluid approach. Validation
   of the simulation results with the experiments demonstrates that, in
   general, simulation satisfactorily reproduces the key fluidization and
   mixing features of biomass particles such as the global and local time
   average distribution and velocity profiles. (C) 2015 Published by

Abstract = {{In the absence of any external applied magnetic field, we have found
   that a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) can produce a significant output
   direct voltage under microwave radiation at frequencies, which are far
   from the ferromagnetic resonance condition, and this voltage signal can
   be increase by at least an order of magnitude by applying a direct
   current bias. The enhancement of the microwave detection can be
   explained by the nonlinear resistance/conductance of the MTJs. Our
   estimation suggests that optimized MTJs should achieve sensitivities for
   non-resonant broadband microwave detection of about 5000 mV/mW. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{Execution trace logs are used to analyze system run-time behaviour and
   detect problems. Trace analysis tools usually read the input logs and
   gather either a detailed or brief summary of them to later process and
   inspect in the analysis steps. However, continuous and lengthy trace
   streams contained in the live tracing mode make it difficult to
   indefinitely record all events or even a detailed summary of the whole
   stream. This situation is further complicated when the system aims to
   compare different parts of the trace and provide a multilevel and
   multidimensional analysis. This paper presents an architecture with
   corresponding data structures and algorithms to process stream events,
   generate an adequate summary-detailed enough for recent data and
   succinct enough for old data-and organize them to enable an efficient
   multilevel and multidimensional analysis, similar to online analytical
   processing analyses in the database applications. The proposed solution
   arranges data in a compact manner using interval forms and enables the
   range queries for any arbitrary time durations. Because this feature
   makes it possible to compare of different system parameters in different
   time areas, it significantly influences the system's ability to provide
   a comprehensive trace analysis. Although the Linux operating system
   trace logs are used to evaluate the solution, we propose a generic
   architecture that can be used to summarize various types of stream data.

Abstract = {{Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) have been prepared
   and coated with positively (-NH3+) and negatively (-COO-) charged
   shells. These NPs, as well as their ``bare{''} precursor, which actually
   contain surface hydroxyl groups, have been characterized in vitro, and
   their influence on a human epithelial cell line has been assessed in
   terms of cell metabolic activity, cellular membrane lysis, mitochondrial
   activity, and reactive oxygen species production. Their physicochemical
   characterizations and protein-nanoparticle interactions have been
   determined using dynamic light scattering, high-resolution transmission
   electron microscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
   time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) spectrometry, and Coomassie Blue fast
   staining. Cell-SPION interactions have been determined by PrestoBlue
   resazurin-based, Trypan Blue dye exclusion-based, and MTS cell
   proliferation assays as well as by reactive oxygen species
   determination. The results show that different surface characteristics
   cause different protein corona and cell responses. Some proteins (e.g.,
   albumin) are adsorbed only on positively charged coatings and others
   (e.g., fibrinogen) only on negatively charged coating. No cell deaths
   occur, but cell proliferation is influenced by surface chemistry.
   Proliferation reduction is dose dependent and highest for bare SPIONs.
   Negatively charged SPIONs were the most biocompatible.}},

Abstract = {{Double-clad fibers (DCF) have many advantages in fibered confocal
   microscopes as they allow for coherent illumination through their core
   and partially coherent detection through their inner cladding. We report
   a double-clad fiber coupler (DCFC) made from small inner cladding DCF
   that preserves optical sectioning in confocal microscopy while
   increasing collection efficiency and reducing coherent effects. Due to
   the small inner cladding, previously demonstrated fabrication methods
   could not be translated to this coupler's fabrication. To make such a
   coupler possible, we introduce in this article three new design
   concepts. The resulting DCFC fabricated using two custom fibers and a
   modified fusion-tapering technique achieves high multimodal extraction
   (>= 70 \%) and high single mode transmission (>= 80 \%). Its application
   to reflectance confocal microscopy showed a 30-fold increase in detected
   signal intensity, a 4-fold speckle contrast reduction with a penalty in
   axial resolution of a factor 2. This coupler paves the way towards more
   efficient confocal microscopes for clinical applications. (C) 2015

   deposition of cadmium sulfide (CdS) quantum dots on their surface. The
   achieved surfactant-capped-TiO2 nanorods as well as CdS/TiO2

   easy solution blending with poly (-2-methoxy,
   5-(2-ethyl-hexy-loxy)-p-phenyl vinylene) (MEH-PPV) conjugated polymer to
   prepare the active layer of bulk hetero-junction solar cells (BHJSCs).
   The properties of the synthesized capped-TiO2 nanorods, CdS/TiO2
   nanocomposites, as well as those of their corresponding blends with
   MEH-PPV were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
   thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), UV-Visible spectroscopy, and

   the surfactants (oleic acid, OA, olyamine, OM, and 6-aminohexanoic acid,
   6AHA) left on TiO2 surface and CdS surface modification on BHJSC
   photovoltaic power conversion efficiency (PCE) showed that: i) for the
   same surfactants, when CdS was added on the surface of TiO2 nanorods,
   the PCE increased due to the higher efficiency of CdS compared to
   MEH-PPV; and ii) the best PEC was obtained with CdS/OA-6AHA-capped-TiO2
   nanocomposite due to the shortest length of the carbon-chain of 6AHA,
   leading to higher charge carrier mobility.}},

Abstract = {{Requirements Traceability (RT) links help developers during program
   comprehension and maintenance tasks. However, creating RT links is a
   laborious and resource-consuming task. Information Retrieval (IR)
   techniques are useful to automatically create traceability links.
   However, IR-based techniques typically have low accuracy (precision,
   recall, or both) and thus, creating RT links remains a human intensive
   process. We conjecture that understanding how developers verify RT links
   could help improve the accuracy of IR-based RT techniques to create RT
   links. Consequently, we perform an empirical study consisting of four
   case studies. First, we use an eye-tracking system to capture
   developers' eye movements while they verify RT links. We analyse the
   obtained data to identify and rank developers' preferred types of Source
   Code Entities (SCEs), e.g., domain vs. implementation-level source code
   terms and class names vs. method names. Second, we perform another
   eye-tracking case study to confirm that it is the semantic content of
   the developers' preferred types of SCEs and not their locations that
   attract developers' attention and help them in their task to verify RT
   links. Third, we propose an improved term weighting scheme, i.e.,
   Developers Preferred Term Frequency/Inverse Document Frequency (D P T F
   / I D F), that uses the knowledge of the developers' preferred types of
   SCEs to give more importance to these SCEs into the term weighting
   scheme. We integrate thisweighting scheme with an IR technique, i.e.,
   Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), to create a new technique to RT link
   recovery. Using three systems (iTrust, Lucene, and Pooka), we show that
   the proposed technique statistically improves the accuracy of the

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Advanced MR imaging techniques are critical to
   understanding the pathophysiology of conditions involving the spinal
   cord. We provide a novel, quantitative solution to map vertebral and
   spinal cord levels accounting for anatomic variability within the human
   spinal cord. For the first time, we report a population distribution of
   the segmental anatomy of the cervical spinal cord that has direct
   implications for the interpretation of advanced imaging studies most
   often conducted across groups of subjects.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers underwent a
   T2-weighted, 3T MRI of the cervical spinal cord. Two experts marked the
   C3-C8 cervical nerve rootlets, C3-C7 vertebral bodies, and
   pontomedullary junction. A semiautomated algorithm was used to locate
   the centerline of the spinal cord and measure rostral-caudal distances
   from a fixed point in the brain stem, the pontomedullary junction, to
   each of the spinal rootlets and vertebral bodies. Distances to each
   location were compared across subjects. Six volunteers had 2 additional
   scans in neck flexion and extension to measure the effects of patient
   positioning in the scanner.
   RESULTS: We demonstrated that substantial variation exists in the
   rostral-caudal position of spinal cord segments among individuals and
   that prior methods of predicting spinal segments are imprecise. We also
   show that neck flexion or extension has little effect on the relative
   location of vertebral-versus-spinal levels.
   CONCLUSIONS: Accounting for spinal level variation is lacking in
   existing imaging studies. Future studies should account for this
   variation for accurate interpretation of the neuroanatomic origin of
   acquired MR signals.}},

   designed to generate two main beams in different directions and
   orthogonal CPs. This antenna has been fabricated and characterized. For

   a double Pierrot cell having a twofold rotation symmetry, which leads to
   an increased bandwidth and less sensitivity to variations in the angle
   of incidence. Experimental results in good agreement with full wave

Abstract = {{An air-filled substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) made of a multilayer
   printed circuit board process is proposed in this paper. It is of
   particular interest for millimeter-wave applications that generally
   require low cost and low-loss performance and excellent power-handling
   capability. This three-layered air-filled SIW allows for substantial
   loss reduction and power-handling capability enhancement. The top and
   bottom layers may make use of a low-cost standard substrate such as FR-4
   on which baseband or digital circuits can be implemented so to obtain a
   very compact, high-performance, low-cost, and self-packaged
   millimeter-wave integrated system. Over Ka-band (U-band), it is shown
   that the air-filled SIW compared to its dielectric-filled counterparts
   based on Rogers substrates RT/Duroid 5880 and also 6002 reduces losses
   by a mean value of 0.068 dB/cm (0.098 dB/cm) and 0.104 dB/cm (0.152
   dB/cm), increases average power-handling capability by 8 dB (6 dB) and
   7.5 dB (5.7 dB), and quality factor by 2.7 (2.8) and 3.6 (3.8) times,
   respectively. The peak power-handling capability of the proposed
   structure is also studied. A wideband transition is presented to
   facilitate interconnects of the proposed air-filled SIW with
   dielectric-filled SIW. Design steps of this transition are detailed and
   its bandwidth limitation due to fabrication tolerances is theoretically
   examined and established. For validation purposes, a back-to-back
   transition operating over the Ka-band is fabricated. It achieves a
   return loss of better than 15 dB and an insertion loss of 0.6 +/- 0.2 dB
   (0.3 +/- 0.1 dB for the transition) from 27 to 40 GHz. Finally, two
   elementary circuits, namely, the T-junction and 90 degrees hybrid
   coupler based on the air-filled SIW, are also demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Total metal-based toxicity potentials, like the ones used in life cycle
   assessment (LCA), can sometimes introduce bias and significantly affect
   the validity of LCA results since toxicity is associated with the
   bioavailable metal fraction.
   Here, the bioavailable fraction of zinc (Zn) for world soil types is
   obtained using the WHAM 6.0 geochemical speciation model. Prior to this,
   the usability of the WHAM model for soils using only globally available
   soil properties (soil texture, pH, cation exchange capacity, carbonate,
   and organic matter content) was validated with experimental soil data
   and compared to the use of empirical regressions.
   The results confirm that WHAM can predict Zn bioavailable fraction with
   an uncertainty of less than 2 orders of magnitude-41 \% being of the
   same order of magnitude-for a wide variety of soils relative to field
   data, yielding estimates that are better than empirical regression
   results in terms of rank and value. World BFs for Zn span over 6 to 18
   orders of magnitude for soluble and true solution Zn, respectively, thus
   confirming the importance of considering spatial variability. In total,
   231 soil archetypes are defined based on the soil properties that
   influence speciation.
   When compared to experimental values, soluble Zn obtained with WHAM
   seems to constitute a more reliable indicator of the bioavailable
   fraction of Zn than true solution Zn. Estimates obtained with the WHAM
   6.0 model for soluble Zn were closer to field data in terms of value and
   rank as compared to estimates obtained with empirical regressions.
   Refining is required to obtain true solution Zn in organic soils.
   Although not exhaustive, the validation process covers a considerable
   proportion of world soils, therefore indicating that the method is
   promising to study Zn bioavailability at the global scale.}},

Title = {{GPU-accelerated regularized iterative reconstruction for few-view cone

Abstract = {{Purpose: The present work proposes an iterative reconstruction technique
   designed for x-ray transmission computed tomography (CT). The main
   objective is to provide a model-based solution to the cone-beam CT
   reconstruction problem, yielding accurate low-dose images via few-views
   acquisitions in clinically acceptable time frames.
   Methods: The proposed technique combines a modified ordered subsets
   convex (OSC) algorithm and the total variation minimization (TV)
   regularization technique and is called OSC-TV. The number of subsets of
   each OSC iteration follows a reduction pattern in order to ensure the
   best performance of the regularization method. Considering the high
   computational cost of the algorithm, it is implemented on a graphics
   processing unit, using parallelization to accelerate computations.
   Results: The reconstructions were performed on computer-simulated as
   well as human pelvic cone-beam CT projection data and image quality was
   assessed. In terms of convergence and image quality, OSC-TV performs
   well in reconstruction of low-dose cone-beam CT data obtained via a
   few-view acquisition protocol. It compares favorably to the few-view
   TV-regularized projections onto convex sets (POCS-TV) algorithm. It also
   appears to be a viable alternative to full-dataset filtered
   backprojection. Execution times are of 1-2 min and are compatible with
   the typical clinical workflow for nonreal-time applications.
   Conclusions: Considering the image quality and execution times, this
   method may be useful for reconstruction of low-dose clinical
   acquisitions. It may be of particular benefit to patients who undergo
   multiple acquisitions by reducing the overall imaging radiation dose and
   associated risks. (C) 2015 American Association of Physicists in

Journal = {{PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{135}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background: In the first stage of expander-to-implant breast
   reconstruction, postoperative expansion is classically initiated at 10
   to 14 days (conventional approach). The authors hypothesized that it may
   be beneficial to wait 6 weeks postoperatively before initiating serial
   expansion (delayed approach). Clinical and ultrastructural
   periprosthetic capsule analysis is first required before determining
   whether a delayed approach ultimately improves capsular tissue adherence
   and expansion process predictability.
   Methods: Patients undergoing two-stage implant-based breast
   reconstruction were enrolled prospectively in this study. During
   expander-to-implant exchange, the clinical presence of ``Velcro{''}
   effect, biofilm, and double capsule was noted. Peri-prosthetic capsule
   samples were also sent for scanning electron microscopic observation of
   three parameters: surface relief, cellularity, and biofilm. Samples were
   divided into four groups for data analysis (group 1,
   conventional/Biocell; group 2, delayed/Biocell; group 3,
   conventional/Siltex; and group 4, delayed/Siltex).
   Results: Fifty-six breast reconstructions were included. Each group
   comprised between 13 and 15 breasts. In group 1, no cases exhibited the
   Velcro effect and there was a 53.8 percent incidence of both biofilm and
   double capsule. In group 2, all cases demonstrated the Velcro effect and
   there were no incidences of biofilm or double capsule. Group 3 and group
   4 cases did not exhibit a Velcro effect or double-capsule formation;
   however, biofilm was present in up to 20.0 percent. All group 2 samples
   revealed more pronounced three-dimensional relief on scanning electron
   microscopy.
   Conclusions: Variations in expansion protocols can lead to observable
   modifications in periprosthetic capsular architecture. There may be real
   benefits to delaying expander inflation until 6 weeks postoperatively
   with Biocell expanders.}},

Abstract = {{The operational transformation (OT) approach, used in many collaborative
   editors, allows a group of users to concurrently update replicas of a
   shared object and exchange their updates in any order. The basic idea is
   to transform any received update operation before its execution on a
   replica of the object. Concretely, OT consists of a
   centralized/decentralized integration procedure and a transformation
   function. In the context of decentralized integration, designing
   transformation functions for achieving convergence of object replicas is
   a critical and challenging issue. Indeed, the transformation functions
   proposed in the literature are all revealed inefficient. In this paper,
   we investigate the existence of transformation functions. From the
   theoretical point of view, two properties, named TP1 and TP2, are
   necessary and sufficient to ensure convergence. Using controller
   synthesis technique, we show that there are some transformation
   functions, which satisfy TP1 for the basic signatures of insert and
   delete operations. But, there is no transformation function, which
   satisfies both TP1 and TP2. Consequently, a transformation function
   which satisfies both TP1 and TP2 must necessarily have additional
   parameters in the signatures of some update operations. We propose, in
   this paper, a new transformation function and show formally that it
   ensures convergence.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a control scheme for thermal management in smart
   buildings based on predictive power admission control. This approach
   combines model predictive control with budget-schedulability analysis in
   order to reduce peak power consumption as well as ensure thermal
   comfort. First, the power budget with a given thermal comfort constraint
   is optimized through budget-schedulability analysis which amounts to
   solving a constrained linear programming problem. Second, the effective
   peak power demand is reduced by means of the optimal scheduling and
   cooperative operation of multiple thermal appliances. The performance of
   the proposed control scheme is assessed by simulation based on the
   thermal dynamics of a real eight-room office building located at Danish
   Technical University.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a methodology for knowledge representation using
   ontology concepts. We employ an ontology-based schema to overcome the
   problems of heterogeneity and inconsistency in maintenance records,
   which are attributable to abbreviations, noisy data, nongeneric data
   structures, and ambiguous technical words in textual maintenance
   records. Our methodology employs a bond graph model (BGM) to produce a
   function structure of equipment related to fault propagation in
   part-component levels. Our method combines OWL-Lite/RDF and the ISO
   14224 and ISO 15926 international standards in order to obtain a generic
   system-level representation model. Our approach also constructs
   transparent cause-effect knowledge, which facilitates interpretation and
   computer conversion using ISO 14224 and ISO 15926. The web ontology
   language (OWL) and resource description framework (RDF) are used to
   convert the generic human-readable interpretation into a standard
   computer-readable representation, thereby generating a knowledge base
   with maximum shareability and accessibility. We applied the methodology
   to a typical pneumatic valve. The results show that BGM can cross-link
   the identified words and the domain-specific logic to obtain the
   function structure of an object with causality inference, as well as
   enriching semantic extraction based on the context of a maintenance
   report, which improves the interpretation and computer conversion. Using
   OWL/RDF, actions such as interexchange, retrieval, and storage are
   possible for fault diagnosis applications in a multidisciplinary
   environment. Our method provides a generic technical understanding,
   which enriches semantic extraction and knowledge discovery in a typical
   maintenance report.}},

Abstract = {{Machine tool kinematic errors directly impact on the accuracy of
   machined parts. A general volumetric error formulation effectively
   implementing ISO230-1:2012 definition and an off-line compensation
   scheme are proposed and partly tested to improve part accuracy on a
   five-axis CNC machine. Using rigid body kinematics and estimated machine
   error parameters, the machine position commands contained in a standard
   G-code are used to calculate the tool erroneous location. The Jacobian,
   expressing the differential joint space to Cartesian space relationship,
   is also developed and used to calculate minute joint command
   modifications so that the effect of inter-axis link errors and
   intra-axis error motions, for example, can be canceled by making small
   changes directly to the G-code. Finally, a simple case of a machining
   sequence producing a surface mismatch in the presence of particular
   machine deviations is used to illustrate the usefulness of the
   analytical tools presented. A graphical representation of the volumetric
   errors assists in understanding the impact of each error source for this
   particular application. The measurement results are compatible with the
   predicted volumetric error values and show an accuracy improvement of
   about 90 \% after compensation.}},

Abstract = {{The past decade has seen advances in general methods for symmetry
   breaking in mixed-integer linear programming. These methods are
   advantageous for general problems with general symmetry groups. Some
   important classes of mixed integer linear programming problems, such as
   bin packing and graph coloring, contain highly structured symmetry
   groups. This observation has motivated the development of
   problem-specific techniques. In this paper we show how to strengthen
   orbital branching in order to exploit special structures in a problem's
   symmetry group. The proposed technique, to which we refer as modified
   orbital branching, is able to solve problems with structured symmetry
   groups more efficiently. One class of problems for which this technique
   is effective is when the solution variables can be expressed as 0/1
   matrices where the problem's symmetry group contains all permutations of
   the columns. We use the unit commitment problem, an important problem in
   power systems, to demonstrate the strength of modified orbital
   branching.}},

Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{91-105}},

Abstract = {{This paper validates the performance of analytical homogenization models
   at predicting the local field statistics in randomly distributed and
   oriented ellipsoidal particles reinforced composites. The numerical
   validation was based on a newly introduced load independent metric,
   which allowed to formulate general conclusions. A large validation
   campaign was conducted and the Representative Volume Element (RVE) was
   rigorously determined for each combination of phases mechanical
   properties, particles volume fraction and aspect ratio. The load
   independent properties computed numerically were compared to those
   predicted by a range of analytical models. The study revealed that the
   original Benveniste's interpretation of the Mod-Tanaka scheme led to the
   most accurate first order moments and intra-matrix second order moments,
   provided that the mechanical properties contrast between the particles
   and the matrix are low. For higher contrasts, Lielens' model delivers
   the most accurate estimates. The self-consistent scheme is the most
   suited model to predict the intra-particle second order moments when the
   particles aspect ratio is low. For particles with high aspect ratio,
   Lielens' model could be an alternative to the self-consistent scheme.
   Furthermore, an interpolation model has been developed and it has been
   shown to predict accurately the mean and covariance tensors of the
   intraphase stress fields. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A biofidelic multibody model of the upper limb for the quantitative
   assessment of joint kinematics and dynamics has the potential to become
   an innovative tool in many application fields. However, forearm
   kinematic modeling still presents challenges due to the complexity of
   providing a closed-loop and subject-specific definition of its multiple
   degrees of freedom. In this context, this study aims to refine the upper
   limb multibody model by means of a forearm closed-loop kinematic chain
   and personalized joint parameters to quantify the forearm joint
   kinematics and dynamics. To assess the benefits of this refinement, the
   proposed model is compared to four conventional models according to (i)
   the global and local movement reconstruction errors during inverse
   kinematics and (ii) the joint torque-angle pattern. Fifteen (15) healthy
   adults performed two cyclic dynamic tasks, namely elbow
   flexion-extension (FE) and forearm pronation-supination (PS). Results
   show that the proposed model leads to a reduction of the global
   reconstruction error up to 15 \% and 31 \% during FE and PS tasks,
   respectively, while computational times remain similar. The local
   reconstruction errors show less compensation at the shoulder and wrist
   for the proposed model. The PS angle and torque are increased by 24 \%
   during the PS task for the proposed model when compared to conventional
   models. In conclusion, this study addresses novel methodology aspects
   and a comprehensive description of a forearm multibody model that can
   serve in multiple applications requiring a realistic representation of
   the upper limb kinematics and dynamics without increasing the
   computational time.}},

Abstract = {{The development is presented of a model of the thermodynamic functions
   of enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs energy for the elements carbon and
   hydrogen in coke crystallites. It is applicable to varying degrees of
   graphitization, described by the crystallite length L-a and the
   crystallite height L-c. The model parameters are derived from known
   properties such as bond enthalpies and entropies of formation. Good
   agreement has been obtained between the predicted thermal
   dehydrogenation of petroleum cokes and experimental data. The removal of
   hydrogen from idealized coke crystallites is predicted to occur mostly
   between 1100 and 1300 K. Agreement has also been found in the comparison
   of the predicted thermodynamic stability of coke relative to graphite,
   in a previous experimental study. This stability has been determined as
   at approximate to 900 J g(-1) at temperatures between 950 and 1250 K and
   for L-a = 10 nm. The current predictive capacity of the present model is
   valid for temperatures up to 2500 K. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The present work deals with two different CdS nanostructures produced
   via hydrothermal and solvothermal decompositions of aminocaproic acid
   (ACA)-mixed Cd-thiourea complex precursor at 175 degrees C. Both
   nanostructures were extensively characterized for their structural,
   morphological and optical properties. The powder X-ray diffraction
   characterization showed that the two CdS nanostructures present a
   wurtzite morphology. Scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive
   X-ray characterizations revealed that the hydrothermal decomposition
   produced well-shaped CdS flowers composed of six dendritic petals, and
   the solvothermal decomposition produced CdS microspheres with close
   stoichiometric chemical composition. The UV-vis absorption and
   photoluminescence spectra of CdS dendritic flowers and microsphere
   nanostructures showed that both nanostructures present a broad
   absorption between 200 and 700 nm and exhibit strong green emissions at
   576 and 520 nm upon excitations at 290 nm and 260 nm, respectively. The
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET)
   characterizations confirmed that CdS microspheres were mesoporous and
   were composed of small nanocrystals. A possible growth mechanism in the
   formation of the CdS nanostructures was proposed based on morphology
   evolution as a function of the reaction time. Furthermore, the
   as-synthesized CdS nanostructures were found to exhibit highly efficient
   photocatalytic activities for the degradation of methyl orange (MeO) and
   rhodamine B (RhB) dyes.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{142}},

Month = {{MAR 28}},
Abstract = {{The composition dependence of thermal transport properties of the (Na,
   K)Cl rocksalt solid solution is investigated through equilibrium
   molecular dynamics (EMD) simulations in the entire range of composition
   and the results are compared with experiments published in recent work
   {[}Gheribi et al., J. Chem. phys. 141, 104508 (2014)]. The thermal
   diffusivity of the (Na, K)Cl solid solution has been measured from 473 K
   to 823 K using the laser flash technique, and the thermal conductivity
   was deduced from critically assessed data of heat capacity and density.
   The thermal conductivity was also predicted at 900 K in the entire range
   of composition by a series of EMD simulations in both NPT and NVT
   statistical ensembles using the Green-Kubo theory. The aim of the
   present paper is to provide an objective analysis of the capability of
   EMD simulations in predicting the composition dependence of the thermal
   transport properties of halide solid solutions. According to the
   Klemens-Callaway {[}P. G. Klemens, Phys. Rev. 119, 507 (1960) and J.
   Callaway and H. C. von Bayer, Phys. Rev. 120, 1149 (1960)] theory, the
   thermal conductivity degradation of the solid solution is explained by
   mass and strain field fluctuations upon the phonon scattering cross
   section. A rigorous analysis of the consistency between the theoretical
   approach and the EMD simulations is discussed in detail. (c) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{The synthesis of variable composition AuxAg((1-x)) alloyed nanoparticles
   prepared by laser ablation in water is reported. The nanoalloys
   exhibited a single characteristic surface plasmon resonance peak, whose
   spectral position was lying between the surface plasmon resonance peaks
   of neat Ag and Au nanoparticles, at about 400 and 530 nm respectively,
   depending directly on the composition of the alloyed nanoparticles. The
   nonlinear optical response of the nanoalloys was studied in details
   under 532 nm (visible) 35 ps and 4 ns laser excitation and it was found
   to be significant and greatly influenced by the position of the
   plasmonic band relative to the laser excitation wavelength. In this
   respect, increase of the Au molar fraction resulted in shifting of the
   nanoalloy plasmon band toward the location of the plasmon band of neat
   Au nanoparticles, i.e., at about 530 nm, closer to the laser excitation
   wavelength, hence causing more efficient resonance enhancement of the
   nonlinear optical response. Moreover, the nanoalloys were found to
   exhibit strong saturable absorption behavior when excited by ps or ns
   pulses, in the latter case this behavior changing to reverse saturable
   absorption at high laser intensity. The origin, the magnitude and the
   sign of the observed optical nonlinearities of the alloyed nanoparticles
   are explained and discussed in terms of the hot-electron and the
   interband contributions taking place under laser excitation in such
   nanostructures. The possibility of controlling the magnitude and the
   sign of the nonlinear optical response of AuxAg((1-x)) nanoalloys
   through their composition provides an attractive and efficient way to
   tailor the optical nonlinearities of noble metal nanoalloys, making them
   very useful for various emerging photonic, biophotonic, and
   optoelectronic applications.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroligin 1 (NLGN1) is a postsynaptic adhesion molecule that determines
   N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) function and cellular
   localization. Our recent work showed that Nlgn1 knockout (KO) mice
   cannot sustain neuronal activity occurring during wakefulness for a
   prolonged period of time. Since NMDAR-dependent neuronal activity drives
   an important vascular response, we used multispectral optical imaging to
   determine if the hemodynamic response to neuronal stimulation is
   modified in Nlgn1 KO mice. We observed that Nlgn1 KO mice show a 10\%
   lower response rate to forepaw electrical stimulation compared to
   wild-type (WT) and heterozygote (HET) littermates on both the contra-and
   ipsilateral sides of the somatosensory cortex. Moreover, Nlgn1 mutant
   mice showed an earlier oxyhemoglobin peak response that tended to return
   to baseline faster than in WT mice. Analysis of the time course of the
   hemodynamic response also showed that HET mice express a faster dynamics
   of cerebrovascular response in comparison to WT. Taken together, these
   data are indicative of an altered immediate response of the brain to
   peripheral stimulation in Nlgn1 KO mice, and suggest a role for NLGN1 in
   the regulation of cerebrovascular responses. (C) 2015 IBRO. Published by

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider a multi-attribute vehicle routing problem
   derived from a real-life milk collection system. This problem is
   characterized by the presence of a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles,
   multiple depots, and several resource constraints. A branch-and-price
   methodology is proposed to tackle the problem. In this methodology,
   different branching strategies, adapted to the special structure of the
   problem, are implemented and compared. The computational results show
   that the branch-and-price algorithm performs well in terms of solution
   quality and computational efficiency. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Model systems are critical to our understanding of self-assembly
   processes. As such, we have studied the surface self-assembly of a small
   and simple molecule, indole-2-carboxylic acid (I2CA). We combine density
   functional theory gas-phase (DFT) calculations with scanning tunneling
   microscopy to reveal details of I2CA assembly in two different solvents
   at the solution/solid interface, and on Au(111) in ultrahigh vacuum
   (UHV). In UHV and at the trichlorobenzene/highly oriented pyrolytic
   graphite (HOPG) interface, I2CA forms epitaxial lamellar structures
   based on cyclic OH center dot center dot center dot O carboxylic dimers.
   The structure formed at the heptanoic acid/HOPG interface is different
   and can be interpreted in a model where heptanoic acid molecules
   co-adsorb on the substrate with the I2CA, forming a bicomponent
   commensurate unit cell. DFT calculations of dimer energetics elucidate
   the basic building blocks of these structures, whereas calculations of
   periodic two-dimensional assemblies reveal the epitaxial effects
   introduced by the different substrates. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Knee joints are subject to large compression forces in daily activities.
   Due to artefact moments and instability under large compression loads,
   biomechanical studies impose additional constraints to circumvent the
   compression position-dependency in response. To quantify the effect of
   compression on passive knee moment resistance and stiffness, two
   validated finite element models of the tibiofemoral (TF) joint, one
   refined with depth-dependent fibril-reinforced cartilage and the other
   less refined with homogeneous isotropic cartilage, are used. The
   unconstrained TF joint response in sagittal and frontal planes is
   investigated at different flexion angles (0 degrees, 15 degrees, 30
   degrees and 45 degrees) up to 1800N compression preloads. The
   compression is applied at a novel joint mechanical balance point (MBP)
   identified as a point at which the compression does not cause any
   coupled rotations in sagittal and frontal planes. The MBP of the
   unconstrained joint is located at the lateral plateau in small
   compressions and shifts medially towards the inter-compartmental area at
   larger compression forces. The compression force substantially increases
   the joint moment-bearing capacities and instantaneous angular rigidities
   in both frontal and sagittal planes. The varus-valgus laxities diminish
   with compression preloads despite concomitant substantial reductions in
   collateral ligament forces. While the angular rigidity would enhance the
   joint stability, the augmented passive moment resistance under
   compression preloads plays a role in supporting external moments and
   should as such be considered in the knee joint musculoskeletal models.}},

Abstract = {{Parasitic head losses incurred outside the tested soil specimen may
   alter the results of laboratory permeability tests. They can be measured
   by running a blank test in an empty permeameter, and determining the
   flow resistance of the testing equipment. They can also be assessed by
   using the difference between a constant-head test, where the hydraulic
   heads are measured within the tested specimen, and a variable-head test,
   where the hydraulic heads are measured outside the specimen and include
   the parasitic head losses of the testing equipment. When not accounted
   for, they can lead to permeability values that are underestimated. An
   electric analog provides an analytical relationship between variable-and
   constant-head test results. The parameters in the analytical solution
   can be obtained via blank permeability tests. This article emphasizes
   the need to measure hydraulic heads inside the soil specimen during

Abstract = {{Hand hygiene is a growing concern among populations and is a crucial
   element in ensuring patient safety in a healthcare environment. Numerous
   management efforts have been conducted in that regard, including
   education, awareness and observations. To better evaluate the possible
   impact of technology on a healthcare setting, we observed the impact of
   a particular niche technology developed as an answer to the growing hand
   hygiene concerns. A study was conducted at Salmaniya Medical Complex
   (SMC) in Bahrain on a total of 16 Coronary Care Unit (CCU) beds where
   the system was installed, and the hand hygiene activity of healthcare
   workers (HCWs) in this area was monitored for a total period of 28 days.
   Comments, remarks and suggestions were noted, and improvements were made
   to the technology during the course of the trial. While resistance to
   change was significant, overall results were satisfactory. Compliance
   with hand hygiene techniques went from 38-42\% to 60\% at the beginning
   of the trial and then increased to an average of 75\% at the end of the
   28-day trial. In some cases, compliance peaked at 85\% or even at 100\%.
   Our case study demonstrates that technology can be used effectively in
   promoting and improving hand hygiene compliance in hospitals, which is
   one way to prevent cross-infections, especially in critical care areas.

Abstract = {{This paper describes a new multiphase modeling for oil bubble actuation
   in microchannel with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The sampling method is
   based on an oil droplet microvalve to measure the conductivity and
   impedance of the CSF in a non-moving liquid. The proposed system was
   simulated using the finite element software Comsol Multiphysics. For the
   fluidic modeling and simulation, the multiphase flow level set package
   of Comsol was used to describe the interaction between oil and CSF.
   Regarding the electric force computation, the Maxwell stress tensor was
   explicitly computed in Comsol and then coupled to the fluid dynamics.
   The values of permittivity of oil (epsilon(oil)) and CSF (epsilon(CSF))
   were used, respectively, 2.2 and 109. Simulation results show the
   actuation of an oil droplet inside a constriction valve, demonstrating
   the operation of the sampling system.}},

Title = {{Managing Hydroelectric Reservoirs Over an Extended Horizon Using Benders

Abstract = {{Traditional stochastic programming methods are widely used for solving
   hydroelectric reservoirs management problems under uncertainty. With
   these methods, random parameters are described using a scenario tree
   possessing an unstructured topology. Therefore, traditional methods can
   potentially handle high-order time-correlation effects, but their
   computational requirements grow exponentially with the branching level
   used to represent parameters (e.g., load, inflows, prices).
   Consequently, random parameters must be discretized very coarsely and,
   as a result, numerical solutions of mid-term optimization models can be
   quite sensitive to small perturbations to the tree parameters. In this
   paper, we propose a new approach for managing high-capacity reservoirs
   over an extended horizon (1-3 years). We partition the planning horizon
   in two stages and assume that a memory loss occurs at the end of the
   first stage. We propose a new Benders decomposition algorithm designed
   specifically to exploit this simplification. The low memory requirement
   of our method enables to consider a much higher branching level than
   would be possible with previous methods. The proposed approach is tested
   on a 104-week production planning problem with stochastic inflows.}},

Journal = {{AIP ADVANCES}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The magnetoresistance of a MgO-based magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) was
   studied experimentally. The magnetoresistance as a function of current
   was measured systematically on MTJs for various MgO cross sectional
   areas and at various temperatures from 7.5 to 290.1 K. The resistance
   current dependence of the MTJ was also measured for different angles
   between the two ferromagnetic layers. By considering particle and
   angular momentum conservation of transport electrons, the current
   dependence of magnetoresistance can be explained by the changing of spin
   polarization in the free magnetic layer of the MTJ. The changing of spin
   polarization is related to the magnetoresistance, its angular dependence
   and the threshold current where TMR ratio equals zero. A
   phenomenological model is used which avoid the complicated barrier
   details and also describes the data. (C) 2015 Author(s).}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a laboratory testing program that was
   designed to investigate the mechanical behaviour of the Tournemire
   argillite. Eighty rock samples were obtained from boreholes drilled at
   different angles in the walls and floor of an existing gallery at the
   Tournemire Underground Research Laboratory (URL), France. The
   experimental program consists of the measurement of the physical
   properties of the argillite and its mechanical response to loading
   during uniaxial tests, triaxial tests with various confining pressures,
   unconfined and confined cyclic tests, and Brazilian tests. Since the
   Tournemire argillite is characterized by the presence of closely spaced
   bedding planes, the rock specimens were loaded in different directions
   to bedding planes (i.e., loading orientation angle, theta = 0 degrees,
   30 degrees, 45 degrees, 60 degrees, and 90 degrees). Acoustic emission
   data were also recorded to detect the initiation and propagation of
   micro-cracks during the uniaxial tests. Most of the tests were performed
   at the natural moisture content of the rock specimens as delivered to
   CANMET Laboratories in Ottawa, Canada, where the experiments were
   conducted. The main objective of the testing program is to identify the
   mechanical properties of the Tournemire argillite. This paper mainly
   focuses on the description and interpretation of the test results. The
   development of an elastoplastic-damage model to describe the mechanical
   behaviour of the Tournemire argillite is the subject of another paper.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing interest in magnetic measurements in machine laminations
   under rotating fields requires better interpretations for many unclear

   of these observations is the negative value of power, which is reported
   during the measurements of rotational core losses using the field metric

   descriptive picture for the field behavior by presenting the
   experimental hysteresis loops. Measurements were carried out on a
   nonoriented silicon steel sample of M36G26. A novel design of
   magnetizing test fixture based on an electromagnetic Halbach array is
   used to perform these measurements. Results show that the negative value
   of power in one loss component is a result of method of analysis, while
   the negative value of total rotational power loss is a consequence of
   faulty measurements.}},

   siphon based perfusion strategy using conventional tools to control
   constant hydrostatic pressure for constant fluid flow rate. In this
   study, the microfluidic based micro-bioreactor is fabricated using a
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) replication process. The micro-bioreactor
   chip is composed of simple oxygen perfusion setup connecting to
   capillary-like branched microchannels and a cell culture and support
   loading area. The function of the new pump-less fluid perfusion in
   microfluidic cell culture chip and maintains constant oxygen supply in
   the cell culture area has been experimentally evaluated. And the results
   demonstrate that this proposed microfluidic flow system in a
   micro-bioreactor is proved to provide a linear distribution of oxygen
   throughout the cell culture area without any external and internal
   interference. Also, oxygen diffusion into the culture area through a
   microscale channel has been successfully established by the constant
   hydraulic pressure controlled by siphoning effect. Such flow system was
   used in a PDMS based microfluidic micro-bioreactor design to provide the
   high-throughput oxygen diffusion and perfusion, and the uniform
   oxygen/nutrient distribution continuously supplied for dermal fibroblast

Abstract = {{A magnetically tunable ferrite-loaded half-mode substrate integrated
   waveguide (HMSIW) is presented. To achieve the magnetic tuning, a planar
   Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) slab is loaded along the metalized wall of the
   HMSIW, where the concentration of the magnetic field is strongest.
   Static (DC) magnetic bias is applied on the ferrite slab transversely to
   the direction of propagation. Measured phases of forward and reverse
   transmission coefficients show the non-reciprocal behavior of this
   transmission line. Measured results illustrating the comparison between
   a single ferrite slab-loaded SIW and a HMSIW are presented. As an
   application example, a two-dimensionally tunable bandpass filter (BPF)
   operating at X-band is proposed and studied. By controlling the value of
   loaded lumped capacitors and the applied magnetic bias, a bandwidth
   tunable BPF is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents and demonstrates a harmonic harvesting technique,
   which aims at rerectifying and recycling the rectifier output harmonics
   in order to increase the RF-to-dc conversion efficiency. Firstly, an
   analytical framework is developed based on the Ritz-Galerkin technique
   to investigate the output power distribution of a simple millimeter-wave
   rectifier circuit over its dc and generated harmonics components. The
   numerical results show that about 32\% and 66\% of the output power is
   distributed over the dc component and the first harmonic, respectively.
   In order to recycle and harvest the first harmonic power component, a
   35-GHz voltage doubler rectifier implemented in microstrip technology
   and capable of harmonic harvesting is then studied and designed. To
   evaluate the performance of the proposed rectifier, the conventional
   voltage doubler and the harmonic signal rectifiers are fabricated and
   measured. The measured RF-to-dc conversion efficiencies of 34\% at 20-mW
   input RF power for the harmonic harvester configuration, and 23\% at the
   same input RF power level for the conventional voltage doubler are
   observed. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed harmonic rectifier
   suggests about 12\% efficiency improvement compared to previously
   reported millimeter-wave rectifiers at the same level of input power (20
   mW). The proposed rectifier configuration can find potential
   applications in the development of millimeter-wave wireless power
   transmission devices operating at medium power range (1-100 mW).}},

   commensurate coupled-line sections, CCL and HC phasers exhibit N
   group-delay peaks per coupled-line section harmonic frequency band, in
   contrast to the CCS configuration, which exhibits only one peak within
   this band. It is also shown that for a given maximum achievable
   coupling-coefficient, the HC configuration provides the largest
   group-delay swing. A wave-interference analysis is finally applied to
   the various coupled-line phasers, explaining their unique group-delay
   characteristics based on physical wave-propagation mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Search-based approaches have been extensively applied to solve the
   problem of software test-data generation. Yet, test-data generation for
   object-oriented programming (OOP) is challenging due to the features of
   OOP, e.g., abstraction, encapsulation, and visibility that prevent
   direct access to some parts of the source code. To address this problem
   we present a new automated search-based software test-data generation
   approach that achieves high code coverage for unit-class testing. We
   first describe how we structure the test-data generation problem for
   unit-class testing to generate relevant sequences of method calls.
   Through a static analysis, we consider only methods or constructors
   changing the state of the class-under-test or that may reach a test
   target. Then we introduce a generator of instances of classes that is
   based on a family of means-of-instantiation including subclasses and
   external factory methods. It also uses a seeding strategy and a
   diversification strategy to increase the likelihood to reach a test
   target. Using a search heuristic to reach all test targets at the same
   time, we implement our approach in a tool, JTExpert, that we evaluate on
   more than a hundred Java classes from different open-source libraries.
   JTExpert gives better results in terms of search time and code coverage
   than the state of the art, EvoSuite, which uses traditional techniques.}},

Title = {{Effect of Grain Boundaries on the Lattice Thermal Transport Properties

Volume = {{98}},

Abstract = {{We present two theoretical models to predict the lattice thermal
   conductivity degradation of insulating materials at high temperature
   (above one-third of the Debye temperature). This degradation is due to
   the presence of grains, with known sizes and shapes, inducing thermal
   resistance at their boundaries. The first model is derived directly from
   the kinetic theory of gases (KTG). The formulation of the second is
   based on a localized continuum model (LCM), assuming phonon Umklapp
   scattering and the Debye approximation of phonon density of state. The
   two proposed models are purely predictive, as no experimental
   information related to the grain size dependence of the thermal
   conductivity is necessary for the parameterization of the models. The
   predictive accuracy of the two proposed models is tested on several
   different types of electrically insulating compounds. Although the model
   derived from the KTG is similar to the well-known Kapitza thermal
   resistance formalism, it fails to predict the grain size dependence of
   the lattice thermal conductivity. The one derived from a LCM is a new
   formalism predicting, with good accuracy, the lattice thermal
   conductivity as a function of the average grain size. It is applicable
   for microstructures with a grain size typically above 20-50nm.}},
