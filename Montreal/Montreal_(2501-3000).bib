Abstract = {{Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) is a field of active development.
   The last decade has seen prolific publication of new impact assessment
   methods covering many different impact categories and providing
   characterization factors that often deviate from each other for the same
   substance and impact. The LCA standard ISO 14044 is rather general and
   unspecific in its requirements and offers little help to the LCA
   practitioner who needs to make a choice. With the aim to identify the
   best among existing characterization models and provide recommendations
   to the LCA practitioner, a study was performed for the Joint Research
   Centre of the European Commission (JRC).
   Existing LCIA methods were collected and their individual
   characterization models identified at both midpoint and endpoint levels
   and supplemented with other environmental models of potential use for
   LCIA. No new developments of characterization models or factors were
   done in the project. From a total of 156 models, 91 were short listed as
   possible candidates for a recommendation within their impact category.
   Criteria were developed for analyzing the models within each impact
   category. The criteria addressed both scientific qualities and
   stakeholder acceptance. The criteria were reviewed by external experts
   and stakeholders and applied in a comprehensive analysis of the
   short-listed characterization models (the total number of criteria
   varied between 35 and 50 per impact category). For each impact category,
   the analysis concluded with identification of the best among the
   existing characterization models. If the identified model was of
   sufficient quality, it was recommended by the JRC. Analysis and
   recommendation process involved hearing of both scientific experts and
   stakeholders.
   Recommendations were developed for 14 impact categories at midpoint
   level, and among these recommendations, three were classified as
   ``satisfactory{''} while ten were ``in need of some improvements{''} and
   one was so weak that it has ``to be applied with caution.{''} For some
   of the impact categories, the classification of the recommended model
   varied with the type of substance. At endpoint level, recommendations
   were only found relevant for three impact categories. For the rest, the
   quality of the existing methods was too weak, and the methods that came
   out best in the analysis were classified as ``interim,{''} i.e., not
   recommended by the JRC but suitable to provide an initial basis for
   further development.
   The level of characterization modeling at midpoint level has improved
   considerably over the last decade and now also considers important
   aspects like geographical differentiation and combination of midpoint
   and endpoint characterization, although the latter is in clear need for
   further development. With the realization of the potential importance of
   geographical differentiation comes the need for characterization models
   that are able to produce characterization factors that are
   representative for different continents and still support aggregation of
   impact scores over the whole life cycle. For the impact categories human
   toxicity and ecotoxicity, we are now able to recommend a model, but the
   number of chemical substances in common use is so high that there is a
   need to address the substance data shortage and calculate
   characterization factors for many new substances. Another unresolved
   issue is the need for quantitative information about the uncertainties
   that accompany the characterization factors. This is still only
   adequately addressed for one or two impact categories at midpoint, and
   this should be a focus point in future research. The dynamic character
   of LCIA research means that what is best practice will change quickly in
   time. The characterization methods presented in this paper represent
   what was best practice in 2008-2009.}},

Title = {{Review of methods addressing freshwater use in life cycle inventory and

Abstract = {{In recent years, several methods have been developed which propose
   different freshwater use inventory schemes and impact assessment
   characterization models considering various cause-effect chain
   relationships. This work reviewed a multitude of methods and indicators
   for freshwater use potentially applicable in life cycle assessment
   (LCA). This review is used as a basis to identify the key elements to
   build a scientific consensus for operational characterization methods
   for LCA.
   This evaluation builds on the criteria and procedure developed within
   the International Reference Life Cycle Data System Handbook and has been
   adapted for the purpose of this project. It therefore includes (1)
   description of relevant cause-effect chains, (2) definition of criteria
   to evaluate the existing methods, (3) development of sub-criteria
   specific to freshwater use, and (4) description and review of existing
   methods addressing freshwater in LCA.
   No single method is available which comprehensively describes all
   potential impacts derived from freshwater use. However, this review
   highlights several key findings to design a characterization method
   encompassing all the impact pathways of the assessment of freshwater use
   and consumption in life cycle assessment framework as the following: (1)
   in most of databases and methods, consistent freshwater balances are not
   reported either because output is not considered or because polluted
   freshwater is recalculated based on a critical dilution approach; (2) at
   the midpoint level, most methods are related to water scarcity index and
   correspond to the methodological choice of an indicator simplified in
   terms of the number of parameters (scarcity) and freshwater uses
   (freshwater consumption or freshwater withdrawal) considered. More
   comprehensive scarcity indices distinguish different freshwater types
   and functionalities. (3) At the endpoint level, several methods already
   exist which report results in units compatible with traditional human
   health and ecosystem quality damage and cover various cause-effect
   chains, e.g., the decrease of terrestrial biodiversity due to freshwater
   consumption. (4) Midpoint and endpoint indicators have various levels of
   spatial differentiation, i.e., generic factors with no differentiation
   at all, or country, watershed, and grid cell differentiation.
   Existing databases should be (1) completed with input and output
   freshwater flow differentiated according to water types based on its
   origin (surface water, groundwater, and precipitation water stored as
   soil moisture), (2) regionalized, and (3) if possible, characterized
   with a set of quality parameters. The assessment of impacts related to
   freshwater use is possible by assembling methods in a comprehensive
   methodology to characterize each use adequately.}},

Abstract = {{Discovering and assessing fields of expertise in emerging technologies
   from patent data is not straightforward. First, patent classification in
   an emerging technology being far from complete, the definitions of the
   various applications of its inventions are embedded within communities
   of practice. Because patents must contain full record of prior art,
   co-citation networks can, in theory, be used to identify and delineate
   the inventive effort of these communities of practice. However, the use
   patent citations for the purpose of measuring technological relatedness
   is not obvious because they can be added by examiners. Second, the
   assessment of the development stage of emerging industries has been
   mostly done through simple patent counts. Because patents are not all
   valuable, a better way of evaluating an industry's stage of development
   would be to use multiple patent quality metrics as well as economic
   activity agglomeration indicators. The purpose of this article is to
   validate the use of (1) patent citations as indicators of technological
   relatedness, and (2) multiple indicators for assessing an industry's
   development stage. Greedy modularity optimization of the `Canadian-made'
   nanotechnology patent co-citation network shows that patent citations
   can effectively be used as indicators of technological relatedness.
   Furthermore, the use of multiple patent quality and economic
   agglomeration indicators offers better assessment and forecasting
   potential than simple patent counts.}},

Title = {{Preventing MEK1 activation influences the responses of human
   osteosarcoma cells to bone morphogenetic proteins 2 and 9}},
Journal = {{ANTI-CANCER DRUGS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{It was recently suggested that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 may be
   useful for treating osteosarcoma cells. BMP-9, which has been patented
   to treat breast and prostate cancers, has a higher osteoinductive
   potential than BMP-2. Peptides derived from the knuckle epitope of BMPs
   (pBMPs) also induced osteogenic differentiation. However, the effect of
   BMP-9 and pBMPs on osteosarcoma cells is unclear. We analyzed the
   effects of BMP-2, BMP-9, pBMP-2, and pBMP-9 on the behavior of human
   MG-63 and SaOS-2 osteosarcoma cells. An inhibitor of MEK1 activation
   (PD98059) that prevents downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinase
   1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation and a specific inhibitor of p38 were also
   used as mitogen activated protein kinase-targeting therapy is being
   investigated as a treatment modality for osteosarcoma. BMP-2 and BMP-9
   (1.92 nmol/l) induced the phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 in both
   osteosarcoma cells within 1 h but had different effects on mitogen
   activated protein kinase pathways. Whereas BMP-2 mainly activated
   ERK1/2, BMP-9 phosphorylated p38 within 1 h. pBMP-2 did not activate
   either the Smad or ERK/p38, whereas pBMP-9, like BMP-9, induced both
   Smad1/5/8 and p38 phosphorylation. p38 activation by BMP-9 or pBMP-9 was
   also enhanced by PD98059. However, BMP-2 or BMP-9 increased the amounts
   of distal-less homeobox 5 and Osterix mRNAs in SaOS-2 cells within 6 h,
   whereas pBMP-9 had no effect. PD98059 promoted the highest level of
   Osterix mRNA in SaOS-2 cells incubated with BMP-2 or BMP-9, whereas p38
   inhibitor had no effect. Furthermore, PD98059 induced the lowest
   proliferation of MG-63 cells incubated with BMP-2, whereas p38 inhibitor
   did not affect the proliferation of either osteosarcoma cell line.
   Therefore a combination of BMP-2 or BMP-9 and an inhibitor of MEK1 may
   be a promising tool for regulating osteosarcoma cell behavior.

Abstract = {{A kineticmetabolic model of Solanum tuberosum hairy roots is presented
   in the interest of understanding the effect on the plant cell metabolism
   of a 90\% decrease in cytosolic triosephosphate isomerase (cTPI, EC
   5.3.1.1) expression by antisense RNA. The model considers major
   metabolic pathways including glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, and
   TCA cycle, as well as anabolic reactions leading to lipids, nucleic
   acids, amino acids, and structural hexoses synthesis. Measurements were
   taken from shake flask cultures for six extracellular nutrients
   (sucrose, fructose, glucose, ammonia, nitrate, and inorganic phosphate)
   and 15 intracellular compounds including sugar phosphates (G6P, F6P,
   R5P, E4P) and organic acids (PYR, aKG, SUCC, FUM, MAL) and the six
   nutrients. From model simulations and experimental data it can be noted
   that plant cell metabolism redistributes metabolic fluxes to compensate
   for the cTPI decrease, leading to modifications in metabolites levels.
   Antisense roots showed increased exchanges between the pentose phosphate
   pathway and the glycolysis, an increased oxygen uptake and growth rate.

Abstract = {{The solid solubilities of Al in Mg12La, Mg12Ce, Mg12Pr, Mg41Nd5 phases

   ternary compounds was estimated using the model of Miedema. The
   systematic thermodynamic evaluation and optimizations of ternary
   Al-Mg-RE (RE = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm) systems were based on the available
   experimental data and current investigation. The Al-Mg-Pr and Al-Mg-Nd
   systems were optimized for the first time using a systematic approach.
   Arc-melted key alloys were annealed at T = 673 K for four weeks and the
   phases were analyzed with electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA). The
   Mg12La intermetallic phase was confirmed by the present investigation.
   Optimized model parameters have been obtained for the Gibbs energy
   functions of all stable phases, and the model reproduces most critically
   assessed experimental results. The Modified Quasichemical Model, which
   takes short-range ordering into account, is used for the liquid phase
   and the Compound Energy Formalism (CEF) is used for the solid solutions
   in the binary and ternary systems. Kohler-type extrapolation from binary
   systems was employed, where no ternary parameters were used for the

Abstract = {{A crew pairing is a sequence of flights, connections and rests that
   starts and ends at a crew base and is assigned to a single crew. The
   crew pairing problem consists of determining a minimum cost set of
   feasible crew pairings such that each flight is covered exactly once and
   side constraints are satisfied. Traditionally, this problem has been
   solved in the industry by a heuristic three-phase approach that solves
   sequentially a daily, a weekly, and a monthly problem. This approach
   prohibits or strongly penalizes the repetition of the same flight number
   in a pairing. In this paper, we highlight two weaknesses of the
   three-phase approach and propose alternative solution approaches that
   exploit flight number repetitions in pairings. First, when the flight
   schedule is irregular, we show that better quality solutions can be
   obtained in less computational time if the first two phases are skipped
   and the monthly problem is solved directly using a rolling horizon
   approach based on column generation. Second, for completely regular
   flight schedules, we show that better quality solutions can be derived
   by skipping the daily problem phase and solving the weekly problem
   directly. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   OFDMA-SDMA systems}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Month = {{FEB 26}},
Abstract = {{We consider multi-antenna base stations using orthogonal
   frequency-division multiple access and space division multiple access
   techniques to serve single-antenna users. Some users, called real-time
   users, have minimum rate requirements and must be served in the current
   time slot while others, called non real-time users, do not have strict
   timing constraints and are served on a best-effort basis. The resource
   allocation (RA) problem is to find the assignment of users to
   subcarriers and the transmit beamforming vectors that maximize the total
   user rates subject to power and minimum rate constraints. In general,
   this is a nonlinear and non-convex program and the zero-forcing
   technique used here makes it integer as well, exact optimal solutions
   cannot be computed in reasonable time for realistic cases. For this
   reason, we present a technique to compute both upper and lower bounds
   and show that these are quite close for some realistic cases. First, we
   formulate the dual problem whose optimum provides an upper bound to all
   feasible solutions. We then use a simple method to get a primal-feasible
   point starting from the dual optimal solution, which is a lower bound on
   the primal optimal solution. Numerical results for several cases show
   that the two bounds are close so that the dual method can be used to
   benchmark any heuristic used to solve this problem. As an example, we
   provide numerical results showing the performance gap of the well-known
   weight adjustment method and show that there is considerable room for
   improvement.}},

Title = {{A novel approach to control thermal degradation of PET/organoclay

Abstract = {{Thermal degradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is accelerated
   in the presence of commercial organoclays, and this remains a challenge
   for the industry. While a high level of clay delamination is required in
   polymer nanocomposites, thermal degradation increases furthermore for
   highly exfoliated morphologies due to an increased exposure of the
   polymer matrix to silicate nanoplatelets. In this work, two different
   types of organomodified clay were melt blended with PET in the presence
   of a multifunctional epoxy-based chain extender, Joncryl (R) ADR-4368F
   (Joncryl), to compensate for molecular weight reduction during
   processing. The chain extender was added via a master-batch approach in
   order to promote clay delamination before molecular weight increase. The
   morphological, rheological, mechanical, thermal, and gas barrier
   characteristics of the nanocomposites were studied using several
   characterization techniques. A remarkable improvement in viscoelastic
   properties was observed for samples containing the chain extender due to
   recoupling of degraded chains. A better clay dispersion, enhanced
   barrier properties and increased Young modulus were also obtained for
   nanocomposites containing the chain extender. Compared to neat PET
   films, the oxygen permeability of nanocomposite films containing 4 wt\%
   Cloisite (R) 30B and 1 wt\% Joncryl decreased by 46\%, whereas the
   corresponding permeability decrease for the Nanomer (R) I.28E
   nanocomposite was 40\%. A 66\% improvement in Young modulus was obtained
   for nanocomposite films containing 4 wt\% Nanomer (R) I.28E and 1 wt\%
   Joncryl. The improvement of the tensile modulus for the corresponding
   Cloisite (R) 30B nanocomposite was slightly less. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new pro-active real-time control approach for
   dynamic vehicle routing problems in which the urgent delivery of goods
   is of utmost importance. Without assuming any distribution, stochastic
   knowledge about future requests is generated using past request
   information. The generated knowledge is integrated into the
   transportation process, which is controlled by a Tabu Search algorithm,
   in order to actively guide vehicles to request-likely areas before
   requests arrive there. By analyzing the results attained for various
   test settings, we identify structural diversity as a crucial criterion
   for classifying the quality of stochastic knowledge attainable from past
   request information. This criterion provides a promising starting point
   for assessing the quality of past request information in order to
   efficiently use the derived stochastic knowledge in real-time control
   approaches. We prove the efficiency of our approach by a direct
   comparison with a deterministic approach on test scenarios with varying
   structural diversity. Thanks to the proposed classification of
   structural diversity, differences in results obtained among the tested
   scenarios become explainable. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper studies the interactions between crane handling and truck

   simultaneously. Yard trucks are shared among different ships, which
   helps to reduce empty truck trips in the terminal area. The problem is
   formulated as a constraint programming model and a three-stage algorithm
   is developed. At the first stage, crane schedules are generated by a
   heuristic method. At the second stage, the multiple-truck routing
   problem is solved based on the precedence relations of the
   transportation tasks derived from the first stage. At the last stage a
   complete solution is constructed by using a disjunctive graph. The three
   procedures are linked by an iterative structure, which facilitates the
   search for a good solution. The computational results indicate that the
   three-stage algorithm is effective for finding high-quality solutions

Abstract = {{Starch gelatinization in the presence of high molecular weight polyol
   plasticizers and water was studied under static and dynamic conditions
   and was compared to a glycerol reference. For static gelatinization,
   glycerol, sorbitol, diglycerol and polyglycerol were examined using
   polarized light microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. A wide
   range of starch/water/plasticizer compositions were prepared to explore
   the gelatinization regime for each plasticizer. The plasticizers show
   that the onset and conclusion temperatures for sorbitol and glycerol are
   in the same range and are lower than the other two plasticizers. On the
   other hand, polyglycerol shows a higher gelatinization temperature than
   diglycerol because of its higher molecular weight and viscosity. The
   results indicate that in the case of all plasticizers, increasing the
   water content tends to decrease the gelatinization temperature and,
   except for polyglycerol, increasing the plasticizer content increases
   the gelatinization temperature. In the case of polyglycerol, however,
   increasing the plasticizer content had the opposite effect and this was
   found to be related to the borderline solubility of polyglycerol in
   water. When the polyglycerol/water solubility was increased by
   increasing the temperature of the water/plasticizer/starch slurry, the
   gelatinization temperature dependence was found to be similar to the
   other polyols.
   A rheological technique was developed to study the dynamic
   gelatinization process by tracking the influence of shear on the complex
   viscosity in a couette flow system. Glycerol, diglycerol and sorbitol
   were subjected to different dynamic gelatinization treatments and the
   results were compared with static gelatinization. It is quantitatively
   shown that shear has a major effect on the gelatinization process. The
   conclusion temperature of gelatinization is significantly diminished (up
   to 21 degrees C) in the presence of shear whereas the onset temperature
   of gelatinization remains virtually unchanged as compared to static
   conditions. By comparing glycerol, diglycerol and sorbitol data, it is
   shown that the molecular weight or structure did not qualitatively
   affect the changes shear imposed on dynamic gelatinization. Shear had a
   relatively more pronounced effect on diglycerol as the plasticizer with
   less hydrogen bonding ability. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A liquid scintillator (LS) based on linear alkyl benzene (LAB) solvent
   has been characterized using multiple radiation sources. The results
   confirm that boron-loaded LAB is suitable for neutron detection in a
   gamma ray environment. To study indirectly the LAB pulse shape
   discrimination (PSD) capability between neutrons and gamma rays, a
   dissolved Pb-212 source emitting alpha and beta particles was used to
   emulate the conditions in a mixed radiation field for detecting neutrons
   in the presence of a high gamma ray background. The quenching factor
   depends on the alpha energy and increases from 10 to 25 as the alpha
   energy decreases from 10 to 1 MeV. B-10 loaded LAB-based LS has been
   tested in a neutron beam of energy which is equal to 14.56 meV. The
   observed peak at 60 keVee is attributed to the absorption of neutrons.
   Our results show that a boron-loaded LAB-based scintillator is a
   sensitive medium for neutron detection in a relatively large background
   of gamma rays. A neutron detector could be achieved with a figure of
   merit (EOM) of 1.75. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The penetration lengths of a jet issuing from upward and downward
   injection nozzles were measured in a dense fluidized bed of Geldart A to
   Geldart B particles, operated at superficial velocity well beyond the
   minimum bubbling velocity. Nozzle orientation, injection velocity and
   injected gas density were found to be the parameters having the most
   influence on the jet penetration lengths. Three distinct jet penetration
   lengths were determined for the upward nozzle: L-min, L-max and L-b, in
   accordance with Knowlton and Hirsan's (1980) definition {[}1], while for
   the downward nozzle, only L-min and L-max were observed. The jet
   penetration lengths were correlated with respect to dimensionless groups
   in a systematic approach in an effort to identify the most important
   terms. For each nozzle orientation, the analysis yielded unique
   correlation format which could be applied to each characteristic jet
   length by changing the correlation parameters. Fundamental distinctions
   between the upward and downward nozzles were uncovered. The mechanism
   responsible for the jet momentum dissipation was found to be
   gravitational forces acting on the jet volume for the upward nozzle and
   drag forces exerted on the entrained particles for the downward nozzle.
   Five new correlations were derived for the prediction of the
   characteristic jet lengths for upward and downward nozzles. The
   correlations retained for the upward nozzle were also found to be in
   good agreement with data from a high pressure fluidized bed. (C) 2012

   determined by optical fiber probes, dynamic pressure measurements,
   electrical capacitance tomography, X-ray computed tomography and
   radioactive particle tracking by researchers from different research
   groups. These results are compared with average measurements from
   pressure gradients and overall bed expansion. Results were kept separate
   from each other in a double-blind method. There is general, but
   imperfect, agreement among the different methods for average voidage for
   both the FCC and silica sand. Invasive probes gave similar results and

   geochemical parameters are used for reactive transport. The results
   illustrate how the spatial correlation of hydraulic properties affects
   the moisture distribution and flow within the pile, which in some cases
   creates local preferential flow paths. The numerical simulations also
   show how sulphide mineral oxidation rates can be influenced by the grain
   size, sulphide fraction and moisture content distribution, which may
   explain the large spatial variations observed in the composition of
   drainage water. Such simulations help to better understand the long-term

Abstract = {{A new pyrolysis model was developed to predict the individual product

   obtained from thermogravimetric analysis experiments to a global
   single-step decomposition reaction term to reproduce the nonlinear
   relationship between product selectivity and temperature. A transient
   energy balance based on a lumped capacitance method was also used to
   calculate the tire shred temperature using the rotary drum wall
   temperature as an input. The kinetics model was compared to experimental
   oil production data from the industrial process as well as existing
   models in the literature. It is shown that the model can successfully
   predict the oil production of the industrial process and the model
   accuracy is greater for smooth operating conditions. On the other hand,

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{13-27}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Liquid Composite Molding (LCM) is a composite manufacturing technique,
   in which a dry fibrous reinforcement is placed inside a mold,
   impregnated with a liquid resin and cured. During the fabrication
   process, the fibrous preform is subject to through-thickness and
   in-plane deformations. These deformations may affect the quality of the
   components and their mechanical performance. Hence, the compaction
   behavior of the reinforcement is crucial in order to predict its
   deformation during processing. The present work deals with the first
   stage of LCM manufacturing, during which the dry preform is draped into
   the rigid base mold and then compressed during closure of the upper
   mold. Under traditional manufacturing conditions, the preform is
   subjected to a single static compressive load. In the current study,
   controlled vibrations are applied to the preform before static
   compaction. These vibrations have a strong impact on nesting and on the
   further static compaction behavior of the reinforcement. The scope of
   this investigation is to study the influence of vibration parameters
   such as amplitude and frequency on the compaction of continuous fiber
   beds used to reinforce high-performance composites. Mechanical tests
   were performed using a special DMA instrument that allows characterizing
   the dynamic compaction of fibrous reinforcements at high frequency.}},

Abstract = {{A growing tendency in policy making and carbon footprint estimation
   gives value to temporary carbon storage in biomass products or to
   delayed greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Some life cycle-based methods,
   such as the British publicly available specification (PAS) 2050 or the
   recently published European Commission's International Reference Life
   Cycle Data System (ILCD) Handbook, address this issue. This article
   shows the importance of consistent consideration of biogenic carbon and
   timing of GHG emissions in life cycle assessment (LCA) and carbon
   footprint analysis. We use a fictitious case study assessing the life
   cycle of a wooden chair for four end-of-life scenarios to compare
   different approaches: traditional LCA with and without consideration of
   biogenic carbon, the PAS 2050 and ILCD Handbook methods, and a dynamic
   LCA approach. Reliable results require accounting for the timing of
   every GHG emission, including biogenic carbon flows, as soon as a
   benefit is given for temporarily storing carbon or delaying GHG
   emissions. The conclusions of a comparative LCA can change depending on
   the time horizon chosen for the analysis. The dynamic LCA approach
   allows for a consistent assessment of the impact, through time, of all
   GHG emissions (positive) and sequestration (negative). The dynamic LCA
   is also a valuable approach for decision makers who have to understand
   the sensitivity of the conclusions to the chosen time horizon.}},

Abstract = {{Release of lead from 80\% partially replaced service lines was compared
   to full lead service lines using harvested stabilized lead pipes and
   field brass connectors. After more than a year of stabilization, lead
   release was consistent with field samples. Over the relatively short
   duration partial replacement of lead pipe by copper pipe (3 months),
   generated high lead release, attributed to galvanic corrosion, resulting
   in a final outcome for lead release that was even worse than for a full
   lead pipe. Increased lead release was especially evident at higher flow
   rates. Orthophosphate reduced lead release from full lead pipes by 64\%.
   For partially replaced samples with copper, lead concentrations were
   unchanged by phosphate dosing at moderate flow (103 +/- 265 vs 169 +/-
   349 mu g/L) and were increased to very high levels when sampled at high
   flow rates (1001 +/- 1808 vs 257 +/- 224 mu g/L). The increase lead
   release was in the form of particulate lead (>90\%). In comparison to
   the condition without treatment, increased sulfate treatment had little
   impact on lead release from 100\%-Pb rigs but reduced lead release from
   partially replaced lead pipes with copper. Our results also raise
   questions concerning protocols based on short 30 min stagnation (as
   those used in Canada) due to their incapacity to consider particulate
   lead release generated mostly after longer stagnation. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Accurate estimation of muscle forces during daily activities such as
   walking is critical for a reliable evaluation of loads on the knee
   joint. To evaluate knee joint muscle forces, the importance of the
   inclusion of the hip joint alongside the knee and ankle joints when
   treating the equilibrium equations remains yet unknown. An iterative
   kinematics-driven finite element model of the knee joint that accounts
   for the synergy between passive structures and active musculature is
   employed. The knee joint muscle forces and biomechanical response are
   predicted and compared with our earlier results that did not account for
   moment equilibrium equations at the hip joint. This study indicates that
   inclusion of the hip joint in the optimization along the knee and ankle
   joints only slightly ( < 10\%) influences total forces in quadriceps,
   lateral hamstrings and medial hamstrings. As a consequence, even smaller
   differences are found in predicted ligament forces, contact
   forces/areas, and cartilage stresses/strains during the stance phase of
   gait. The distribution of total forces between the uni- and bi-articular
   muscle components in quadriceps and in lateral hamstrings; however,
   substantially alter at different stance phases. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Optical Network on Chip (ONoC) architectures are emerging as promising
   candidates to solve congestion and latency issues in future embedded
   systems. In this work, we examine how a scalable and fully connected
   ONoC topology can be reduced to fit specific connectivity requirements
   in heterogeneous 3D architectures. Through such techniques, it is
   possible to reduce the number of required wavelengths, laser sources,
   photodetectors and optical switches as well as the length of the longest
   optical path. This allows constraints to be relaxed on source wavelength
   accuracy and passive filter selectivity, and also alleviates power and
   area issues by reducing the number of active devices. The proposed
   reduction method was successfully applied to multiple heterogeneous 3D
   architectures. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Optimizing control of Escherichia coli cultures depends on the
   availability of appropriate on-line sensors for the main culture
   components. An efficient and practical way to maintain E. coli cultures
   in the neighborhood of the optimal operating conditions is to regulate
   the acetate concentration at a constant low level. Unfortunately,
   reliable acetate probes are currently not available on the market. A way
   to overcome this lack of information is to design software sensors. In
   this work, observability conditions are first examined, and Extended
   Kalman Filters (EKF) are developed for various hardware sensor
   configurations, taking account of their reliability and cost, and
   including a possible kinetic parameter estimation. The filters are
   validated using experimental data collected on a lab-scale bioreactor.

Abstract = {{Analyzing and understanding the evolution of large object-oriented
   software systems is an important but difficult task in which matching
   algorithms play a fundamental role. An error-tolerant graph matching
   (ETGM) algorithm can identify evolving classes that maintain a stable
   structure of relations (associations, inheritances, and aggregations)
   with other classes and thus likely constitute the backbone of the
   system. Therefore, to study the evolution of class diagrams, we first
   develop a novel ETGM algorithm, which improves the performance of our
   previous algorithm. Second, we describe the process of building an
   oracle to validate the results of our approach to solve the class
   diagram evolution problem. Third, we report for the new algorithm the
   impact of its parameters on the F-measure summarizing precision
   (quantifying the exactness of the solution) and recall (quantifying the
   completeness of the solution). Finally, with tuned parameters, we carry
   out and report an extensive empirical evaluation of our algorithm using
   small (Rhino), medium (Azureus and ArgoUML), and large systems (Mozilla
   and Eclipse). We thus show that this novel algorithm is scalable, stable
   and has better time performance than its earlier version. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{Interconversion of viscoelastic material functions is a longstanding
   problem that has received attention since the 1950s. There is currently
   no accepted methodology for interconverting viscoelastic material
   functions due to the lack of stability and accuracy of the existing
   methods. This paper presents a new exact, analytical interconversion
   method for linearly viscoelastic material functions expressed as Prony
   series. The new algorithm relies on the equations of the thermodynamics
   of irreversible processes used for defining linearly viscoelastic
   constitutive theories. As a result, interconversion is made possible for
   unidimensional and tridimensional materials for arbitrary material
   symmetry. The algorithm has been tested over a broad range of cases and
   was found to deliver accurate interconversion in all cases. Based on its
   accuracy and stability, the authors believe that their algorithm
   provides a closure to the interconversion of linearly viscoelastic
   constitutive theories expressed with Prony series.}},

   pressure (BP) is a dynamic phenotype that varies rapidly to adjust to
   changing environmental conditions. Standing upright is a recent
   evolutionary trait, and genetic factors that influence postural
   adaptations may contribute to BP variability. We studied the effect of
   posture on the genetics of BP and intermediate BP phenotypes. We
   included 384 sib-pairs in 64 sib-ships from families ascertained by
   early-onset hypertension and dyslipidemia. Blood pressure, three
   hemodynamic and seven neuroendocrine intermediate BP phenotypes were
   measured with subjects lying supine and standing upright. The effect of
   posture on estimates of heritability and genetic covariance was
   investigated in full pedigrees. Linkage was conducted on 196 candidate
   genes by sib-pair analyses, and empirical estimates of significance were
   obtained. A permutation algorithm was implemented to study the postural
   effect on linkage. ADRA1A, APO, CAST, CORIN, CRHR1, EDNRB, FGF2, GC,
   GJA1, KCNB2, MMP3, NPY, NR3C2, PLN, TGFBR2, TNFRSF6, and TRHR showed
   evidence of linkage with any phenotype in the supine position and not
   upon standing, whereas AKR1B1, CD36, EDNRA, F5, MMP9, PKD2, PON1, PPARG,
   PPARGC1A, PRKCA, and RET were specifically linked to standing
   phenotypes. Genetic profiling was undertaken to show genetic
   interactions among intermediate BP phenotypes and genes specific to each
   posture. When investigators perform genetic studies exclusively on a
   single posture, important genetic components of BP are missed. Supine
   and standing BPs have distinct genetic signatures. Standardized
   maneuvers influence the results of genetic investigations into BP, thus
   reflecting its dynamic regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate spatial and metabolic changes associated with
   frontal lobe seizures. Methods: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy
   combined with electroencephalography (EEG-fNIRS) recordings of patients
   with confirmed nonlesional refractory frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE). Key
   Findings: Eighteen seizures from nine patients (seven male, mean age
   27years, range 1346 years) with drug-refractory FLE were captured during
   EEG-fNIRS recordings. All seizures were coupled with significant
   hemodynamic variations that were greater with electroclinical than with
   electrical seizures. fNIRS helped in the identification of seizures in
   three patients with more subtle ictal EEG abnormalities. Hemodynamic
   changes consisted of local increases in oxygenated (HbO) and total
   hemoglobin (HbT) but heterogeneous deoxygenated hemoglobin (HbR)
   behavior. Furthermore, rapid hemodynamic alterations were observed in
   the homologous contralateral region, even in the absence of obvious
   propagated epileptic activity. The extent of HbO activation adequately
   lateralized the epileptogenic side in the majority of patients.
   Significance: EEG-fNIRS reveals complex spatial and metabolic changes
   during focal frontal lobe seizures. Further characterization of these
   changes could improve seizure detection, localization, and understanding
   of the impact of focal seizures.}},

   polarization of an antenna on the channel path gain has been studied and
   the channel cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) has been quantified,
   using both simulation and measurement. In simulation, short dipole
   antennas, which significantly reduce the simulation time, were used to
   investigate path gain behavior in different channels for vertically and
   horizontally polarized antennas. Measurements were taken in an indoor
   environment using a novel dual-polarized antenna, producing normal and
   parallel polarizations to the body surface. The measured signals were
   also analyzed to extract the Rician K-factor which was defined as the
   ratio of the power in the line of sight (LOS) signal to the scattered

Abstract = {{An approximate analytical model, to predict the drag coefficient on a
   cylinder and the two-phase Euler number for upward two-phase cross-flow
   through horizontal bundles, has been developed. To verify the model, two
   sets of experiments were performed with an air-water mixture for a range
   of pitch mass fluxes and void fractions. The experiments were undertaken
   using a rotated triangular (RT) array of cylinders having a
   pitch-to-diameter ratio of 1.5 and cylinder diameter 38 mm. The void
   fraction model proposed by Feenstra et al. was used to estimate the void
   fraction of the flow within the tube bundle. An important variable for
   drag coefficient estimation is the two-phase friction multiplier. A new
   drag coefficient model has been developed, based on the single-phase
   flow Euler number formulation proposed by Zukauskas et al. and the
   two-phase friction multiplier in duct flow formulated by various
   researchers. The present model is developed considering the Euler number
   formulation by Zukauskas et al. as well as existing two-phase friction
   multiplier models. It is found that Marchaterre's model for two-phase
   friction multiplier is applicable to air-water mixtures. The analytical
   results agree reasonably well with experimental drag coefficients and
   Euler numbers in air-water mixtures for a sufficiently wide range of
   pitch mass fluxes and qualities. This model will allow researchers to
   provide analytical estimates of the drag coefficient, which is related
   to two-phase damping. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4007285]}},

Abstract = {{To the best of our knowledge, we present the first needle probe for
   combined optical coherence tomography (OCT), and fluorescence imaging.
   The probe uses double-clad fiber (DCF) that guides the OCT signal and
   fluorescence excitation light in the core and collects and guides the
   returning fluorescence in the large-diameter multimode inner cladding.
   It is interfaced to a 1310 nm swept-source OCT system that has been
   modified to enable simultaneous 488 nm fluorescence excitation and >500
   nm emission detection by using a DCF coupler to extract the returning
   fluorescence signal in the inner cladding with high efficiency. We
   present imaging results from an excised sheep lung with fluorescein
   solution infused through the vasculature. We were able to identify
   alveoli, bronchioles, and blood vessels. The results demonstrate that
   the combined OCT plus fluorescence needle images provide improved tissue
   differentiation over OCT alone. (C) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Past research in this laboratory has focused on the deposition of
   nitrogen- (N)-rich thin organic coatings for biomedical applications;
   among usual fabrication methods are plasma polymerization (PP) at low-
   ({''}L{''}) or atmospheric- (high-, ``H{''})-pressure. In the ``L{''}
   case, ethylene ({''}E{''}, C2H4)/ammonia (NH3) feed-gas mixtures with
   different flow ratios, R, are used, by which the nitrogen- and primary
   amine concentrations, {[}N] and {[}-NH2], respectively, can be
   reproducibly controlled. The generic symbol we use for that family of
   deposits is L-PPE:N. In the present research, we used acetylene
   ({''}A{''}, C2H2) as the hydrocarbon feed, because our earlier
   experience with ``H{''}-type materials (H-PPE:N and H-PPA:N) revealed
   striking differences in physico-chemical (e.g. {[}N] and {[}-NH2], and
   solubility) characteristics, which are important for applications. We
   now find that such differences also exist between the L-PPA:N and
   L-PPE:N families of coatings. This is attributed to the fundamentally
   different bonding structures of ``A{''} and ``E{''}, namely CHa parts
   per thousand CH and CH2=CH2; the former leads to more highly
   cross-linked, {[}NH2]-leaner deposits, as was also noted for the
   ``H{''}-type deposits mentioned above.}},

Abstract = {{Incorporating a biorefinery unit to an operating Kraft pulping process
   has significant technological, economic and social advantages over the
   construction of a grassroot biorefinery. Also, the conversion of a Kraft
   mill from total pulp making to complete biorefinery can be done in a
   stepwise fashion and so give a company that envisages such
   transformation the opportunity to master the new technologies, evaluate
   options and develop an appropriate business plan. In all cases however,
   the road to conversion presents serious challenges. As components of the
   wood such as lignin or hemicelluloses are withdrawn from the Kraft pulp
   line, the heat production capacity from the recovery boiler where they
   are currently burnt is diminished. At the same time the operation of the
   added biorefinery unit increases the steam demand. In order to avoid
   fossil fuel dependency, the total site must be highly integrated and
   optimized. The application of an intensive and innovative energy
   optimization methodology to actual case studies has shown that the
   green, low GHG emissions biorefinery is feasible. The economics can be
   attractive for a site combining specialty wood pulp and bio-product,
   biomass gasification, power cogeneration and heat upgrading by optimally
   positioned and designed absorption heat cycles. The methodology has been
   applied to biorefining technologies for lignin and hemicelluloses
   extraction and valorisation, both technologies being coupled with
   gasification of wood residue. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The assurance of reliability becomes increasingly challenging as the
   complexity of networked control systems (NCS) rapidly increases. Simplex
   architecture was designed to tolerate control software design and
   implementation. This architecture consists of a high assurance
   controller (HAC) and a high performance controller (HPC). The HAC uses
   the linear state feedback control to create a large maximum stability
   region (MSR). The HPC aims at achieving a better control performance and
   may use any design. However, the plant's states under HPC must stay
   within the MSR, or the control is switched to HAC.
   The paper extends Simplex architecture from a single node control system
   to a networked control system, where the stability analysis of this
   networked Simplex (NetSimplex) must address the challenge of computing
   the networked system's MSR (NetMSR) under both network delays and
   varying parameters. A simulation study of a satellite attitude control
   system is carried out to examine the efficacy of NetSimplex
   architecture.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1799-1811}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this study thermoplastic starch (TPS) was prepared with four
   different molecular weight polyol plasticizers: glycerol, sorbitol,
   diglycerol and polyglycerol. Diglycerol-TPS (DTPS) and polyglycerol-TPS
   (PTPS) show significantly lower moisture uptake and a higher temperature
   stability when compared to conventional glycerol-TPS (GTPS). TPS
   formulations were blended with HDPE at a concentration of 20 TPS/80 HDPE
   wt\% and a range of interfacial modifier contents via a one-step
   extrusion process. The emulsification curves of the blends, which track
   the volume and number average diameter of the dispersed TPS domains with
   per cent interfacial modifier, show significantly different profiles and
   a non-correspondence between the d(n) and d(v) values at the critical
   concentration for interfacial saturation. The addition of small amounts
   of interfacial modifier to the blends prepared with diglycerol and
   polyglycerol results in TPS dispersed phases of wide polydispersity with
   droplets in the order of 200-300 nm coexisting with droplets of 5-7 mu
   m. This wide polydispersity of TPS phase size can give insight into the
   mechanism of droplet formation in these systems with interfacial
   modifier and is indicative of an erosion-type mechanism, where small
   portions of the TPS droplet break off at the outer part of the droplet.
   Blends prepared with GTPS and sorbitol-TPS do not display this behaviour
   and show a more classic correspondence of d(n) and d(v) at the critical
   concentration. Dynamic mechanical analysis shows miscible behaviour for
   DTPS and PTPS and partially miscible behaviour for GTPS. This phenomenon
   was attributed to the presence of ether bonds in the chemical structure
   of diglycerol and polyglycerol. The increased chain flexibility and
   lower cohesive energy forces of diglycerol and polyglycerol lead to a
   more homogeneous TPS phase and consequently an erosion-type
   compatibilization at the interface. The mechanical properties of blends
   prepared with polyglycerol and diglycerol show a similar overall
   behaviour to glycerol.}},

Abstract = {{The use of iterative auctions is very common in procurement processes,

   for combinatorial auctions has addressed only the most basic cases and
   has been dominated by primal-dual approaches. In this paper, we consider
   a general production/consumption exchange of interdependent goods, for
   which we investigate iterative auction mechanisms based on mathematical
   programming dual decomposition methods. We focus on Lagrangian
   relaxation and the solution of the Lagrangian dual through subgradient
   algorithms and the bundle method. A case study of a simulated wood chip
   market is used to evaluate numerically the efficiency of the mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{We propose an efficient heuristic method based on Space Partitioning
   (SP) and Tabu Search (TS) to solve the buffer sizing problem in
   unreliable production lines with several inspection stations. In such
   problem, we have an unreliable production line consisting of a certain
   number of machines and fixed-size buffers. These machines produce a
   single part with two different quality levels: conforming and
   non-conforming parts. The production line may contain inspection
   stations whose job is to reject the non-conforming parts from the line.
   The production line must meet a constant rate of demand for the
   conforming finished parts. The objective is to minimize the average long
   term combined storage and shortage costs, while also specifying the
   optimal location of inspection stations. This design problem is a
   difficult mixed integer nonlinear program. Solving even a small instance
   of 10 machines and one inspection station using a direct dynamic
   programming method takes hours. If we especially increase the number of
   machines or the inspection stations, the dynamic programming approach
   becomes drastically inefficient. The method we propose divides the
   search space into a set of disjoint subspaces using a space partitioning
   technique. Tabu search is used to intensify the search in the selected
   subspaces. This combined method finds optimal solutions for small
   instances in a fraction of dynamic programming time. For the largest
   instances (up to 20 machines) the dynamic programming approach was
   unable to solve, our method finds high-quality solutions in reasonable
   times.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THERMODYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{82-91}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Experimental measurement of thermodynamic properties and of phase
   equilibrium for some systems is complicated since these systems may be
   reactive and/or expensive to study. They may contain radioactive or
   scarce components and be otherwise highly unusual for bench top
   manipulation. For these systems, predicting thermodynamic properties
   using theoretical and/or empirical methods is of great interest. In this
   paper, the Engel-Brewer method, the Witusiewicz, Sommer and Faber
   relations, the Miedema and Hard-Sphere model have been reviewed and
   evaluated on their suitability for calculating mixing properties of
   liquid solutions. Analysis of the results indicated that the
   Engel-Brewer method is not robust, while the Miedema model, with some
   modifications, has been evaluated as an appropriate one for predicting
   enthalpy of mixing of liquid solutions. Moreover, the Witusiewicz
   relation and Hard-Sphere model were proved to be more reliable compared
   to that of Sommer and Faber for predicting entropy of mixing of liquid
   alloys. Finally, based on the current work, the combined
   Miedema-Witusiewicz or Miedema/Hard-Sphere models are recommended for
   parameterizing Gibbs free energy of mixing for liquid solutions. (C)

Abstract = {{For several years, mutual information (MI) has been the classic
   multimodal similarity measure. The robustness of MI is closely
   restricted by the choice of MI window sizes. For unsupervised human
   monitoring applications, obtaining appropriate MI window sizes for
   computing MI in videos with multiple people in different sizes and
   different levels of occlusion is problematic. In this work, we apply
   local self-similarity (LSS) as a dense multimodal similarity metric and
   show its adequacy and strengths compared to MI for a human ROIs
   registration. We also propose an LSS-based registration of
   thermal-visible stereo videos that addresses the problem of multiple
   people and occlusions in the scene. Our method improves the accuracy of
   the state-of-the-art disparity voting (DV) correspondence algorithm by
   proposing a motion segmentation step that approximates depth segments in
   an image and enables assigning disparity to each depth segment using
   larger matching window while keeping registration accuracy. We
   demonstrate that our registration method outperforms the recent
   state-of-the-art MI-based stereo registration for several realistic
   close-range indoor thermal-visible stereo videos of multiple people. (c)

Title = {{Removal of plant pathogens from recycled greenhouse wastewater using
   constructed wetlands}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{117}},
Pages = {{153-158}},
Month = {{JAN 31}},
Abstract = {{Because of the lack of high-quality water and the potential pollution of
   groundwater by leached nutrients, recirculation of nutrient solutions
   for greenhouse production is now unavoidable. Although closed growing
   systems offer several advantages from an environmental standpoint, the
   risk of pathogen dissemination is a major concern for growers.
   Constructed wetlands represent an ecological and low-cost alternative
   method for treating agricultural wastewaters. The objective of this
   study was to evaluate the effectiveness of three types of constructed
   wetlands for removing the waterborne plant pathogens, such as Pythium
   ultimum and Fusarium oxysporum, that can be found in greenhouse
   wastewater. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse using three
   types of horizontal subsurface-flow constructed wetlands in eight
   replicates. The wetlands were filled with pozzolana, planted with common
   cattail (Typha latifolia) and supplemented with sucrose or compost
   carbon sources or left without an external carbon source. The wetland
   units received reconstituted greenhouse wastewater and were inoculated
   five times consecutively with P. ultimum and F. oxysporum at 10(6) CFU
   mL(-1). Physical, chemical and biological properties as well as
   environmental parameters were evaluated during 12 weeks to characterize
   conditions related to plant pathogen removal efficiency. Even though
   99.62-99.99\% efficiency for pathogen repression was observed for the
   constructed wetlands, the compost amendment to the wetland promoted the
   development of biofilm around the filter media and the production of
   cell-wall degrading enzymes. Depending on the source of carbon that was
   provided to promote microbial population growth and wetland activity,
   different possible modes of action for pathogen removal were predominant
   but resulted in very high efficiency, considering that the wetlands were
   inoculated with massive populations of plant pathogens that are not
   found at the commercial level. This study showed that constructed
   wetlands can constitute an efficient and safe alternative to treat and
   then reuse greenhouse wastewater. Crown Copyright (c) 2012 Published by

   over-and underexpressing hexokinase (HK, EC 2.7.1.1) was examined. An
   11-fold variation in HK activity resulted in altered root growth, with
   antisense roots growing better than sense roots. Quantification of
   sugars, organic acids and amino acids in transgenic roots demonstrated
   that the manipulation of HK activity had very little effect on the
   intracellular pools of these metabolites. However, adenylate and free Pi
   levels were negatively affected by an increase in HK activity. The flux
   control coefficient of HK over the phosphorylation of glucose was
   measured for the first time in plants. Its value varied with HK level.
   It reached 1.71 at or below normal HK activity value and was much lower
   (0.32) at very high HK levels. Measurements of glycolytic flux and O-2
   uptake rates demonstrated that the differences in glucose
   phosphorylation did not affect significantly glycolytic and respiratory
   metabolism. We hypothesized that these results could be explained by the
   existence of a futile cycle between the pools of hexose-Ps and
   carbohydrates. This view is supported by several lines of evidence.
   Firstly, activities of enzymes capable of catalyzing these reactions
   were detected in roots, including a hexose-P phosphatase. Secondly,
   metabolic tracer experiments using C-14-glucose as precursor showed the
   formation of C-14-fructose and C-14-sucrose. We conclude that futile
   cycling of hexose-P could be partially responsible for the differences
   in energetic status in roots with high and low HK activity and possibly
   cause the observed alterations in growth in transgenic roots. The
   involvement of HK and futile cycles in the control of glucose-6P
   metabolism is discussed.}},

   and characterization of new by-products by LC-QToFMS}},
Journal = {{CHEMISTRY CENTRAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JAN 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: The fate of 14 antidepressants along with their respective
   N-desmethyl metabolites and the anticonvulsive drug carbamazepine was
   examined in a primary sewage treatment plant (STP) and following
   advanced treatments with ozone (O-3). The concentrations of each
   pharmaceutical compound were determined in raw sewage, effluent and
   sewage sludge samples by LC-MS/MS analysis. The occurrence of
   antidepressant by-products formed in treated effluent after ozonation
   was also investigated.
   Results: Current primary treatments using physical and chemical
   processes removed little of the compounds (mean removal efficiency:
   19\%). Experimental sorption coefficients (K-d) of each studied
   compounds were also calculated. Sorption of venlafaxine,
   desmethylvenlafaxine, and carbamazepine on sludge was assumed to be
   negligible (log K-d <= 2), but higher sorption behavior can be expected
   for sertraline (log K-d >= 4). Ozonation treatment with O-3 (5 mg/L) led
   to a satisfactory mean removal efficiency of 88\% of the compounds.
   Screening of the final ozone-treated effluent samples by high
   resolution-mass spectrometry (LC-QqToFMS) did confirm the presence of
   related N-oxide by-products.
   Conclusion: Effluent ozonation led to higher mean removal efficiencies
   than current primary treatment, and therefore represented a promising
   strategy for the elimination of antidepressants in urban wastewaters.
   However, the use of O-3 produced by-products with unknown toxicity.}},

Abstract = {{Proposed is a parallel array histogram architecture (PAHA) suitable for

   processed in parallel to update the histogram bins without any
   additional latency. Also described is a second version of the PAHA with
   a flexible number of inputs, potentially avoiding the need for multiple
   PAHAs in a single application. Implementation results show that the
   architecture can achieve a super-linear speed-up of 43.75x for a 16-way
   PAHA when compared to a software implementation in a general-purpose

Title = {{Subchondral pre-solidified chitosan/blood implants elicit reproducible
   early osteochondral wound-repair responses including neutrophil and
   stromal cell chemotaxis, bone resorption and repair, enhanced repair
   tissue integration and delayed matrix deposition}},
Journal = {{BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{JAN 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: In this study we evaluated a novel approach to guide the
   bone marrow-driven articular cartilage repair response in skeletally
   aged rabbits. We hypothesized that dispersed chitosan particles
   implanted close to the bone marrow degrade in situ in a molecular
   mass-dependent manner, and attract more stromal cells to the site in
   aged rabbits compared to the blood clot in untreated controls.
   Methods: Three microdrill hole defects, 1.4 mm diameter and 2 mm deep,
   were created in both knee trochlea of 30 month-old New Zealand White
   rabbits. Each of 3 isotonic chitosan solutions (150, 40, 10 kDa, 80\%
   degree of deaceylation, with fluorescent chitosan tracer) was mixed with
   autologous rabbit whole blood, clotted with Tissue Factor to form
   cylindrical implants, and press-fit in drill holes in the left knee
   while contralateral holes received Tissue Factor or no treatment. At day
   1 or day 21 post-operative, defects were analyzed by micro-computed
   tomography, histomorphometry and stereology for bone and soft tissue
   repair.
   Results: All 3 implants filled the top of defects at day 1 and were
   partly degraded in situ at 21 days post-operative. All implants
   attracted neutrophils, osteoclasts and abundant bone marrow-derived
   stromal cells, stimulated bone resorption followed by new woven bone
   repair (bone remodeling) and promoted repair tissue-bone integration.
   150 kDa chitosan implant was less degraded, and elicited more apoptotic
   neutrophils and bone resorption than 10 kDa chitosan implant. Drilled
   controls elicited a poorly integrated fibrous or fibrocartilaginous
   tissue.
   Conclusions: Pre-solidified implants elicit stromal cells and vigorous
   bone plate remodeling through a phase involving neutrophil chemotaxis.
   Pre-solidified chitosan implants are tunable by molecular mass, and
   could be beneficial for augmented marrow stimulation therapy if the
   recruited stromal cells can progress to bone and cartilage repair.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{87}},

Abstract = {{The relation between crystallographic texture and magnetic properties of
   GaP epilayers with embedded MnP nanoclusters grown by metal-organic
   vapor phase epitaxy is investigated with angle-dependent ferromagnetic
   resonance (FMR) measurements. A systematic methodology entirely based on
   magnetic characterization identifies all the crystallographic
   orientations of the MnP nanoclusters relative to the GaP matrix as well
   as the volume fraction of MnP in each orientation. For all 18
   crystallographic orientations of the MnP nanoclusters that were
   determined for samples grown at 650 degrees C, the MnP c axis is
   oriented along GaP < 110 >. Our approach also reveals that approximately
   90\% of the clusters have their b axis oriented along GaP < 111 >, while
   the remaining clusters have their b axis oriented along GaP < 100 >. In
   addition, FMR indicates that the ratio of the anisotropy field along the
   intermediate magnetic axis over that of the hard magnetic axis of the
   embedded MnP clusters is increased by more than 20\% compared to bulk
   MnP. Calculations suggest that a magnetoelastic and/or a surface
   contribution to the magnetic anisotropy of the nanoclusters is required
   to explain the observed difference. The methodology presented in this
   work is particularly suited for semiconducting epilayers with embedded
   nanomagnets but could be easily applied to other similar systems. DOI:

   for the surgical correction of thoracic scoliosis.
   Objective. To model and analyze vertebral derotation maneuvers
   biomechanically to maximize the tridimensional correction of scoliosis
   and minimize the implant-vertebra forces.
   Summary of Background Data. Vertebral derotation techniques were
   recently developed to improve the correction of scoliotic deformities in
   the transverse plane. Those techniques consist in applying a combination
   of moments and forces using a vertebral derotation device, cohesively
   linked to the thoracic apical pedicle screws, to derotate the spine and
   the rib cage. However, many variations of the technique exist and the
   correction mechanisms are not fully understood to achieve an optimal
   correction of scoliosis.
   Methods. A biomechanical model was developed to simulate the
   instrumentation surgery numerically of 4 Lenke type 1 patients with
   scoliosis, instrumented using a vertebral derotation device and
   vertebral derotation maneuvers as major correction technique. Then, for
   each case, 32 additional instrumentation surgical procedures were
   simulated to better understand the biomechanics of the vertebral
   derotation technique, varying the implant type and density, the number
   of derotation levels, the vertebral derotation angle and the posteriorly
   oriented force applied during the maneuver.
   Results. On average, among 32 additional simulations, there was an
   important variability of the resulting apical vertebral rotation (15
   degrees) and the mean resultant implant-vertebra force (205 N) but
   little variability for the main thoracic Cobb angle (6 degrees) and the
   thoracic kyphosis (4 degrees). The implant type, the implant density and
   the vertebral derotation angle were the parameters that most influenced
   the correction of scoliosis. The correction in the coronal and
   transverse planes was improved using monoaxial pedicle screw density of
   2 and a bilateral vertebral derotation maneuver on 3 levels at the apex
   of the thoracic curve, with an extra 15 degrees applied on the vertebral
   derotation device. When reducing the implant density by 50\%, it was
   possible to reduce the mean implant-vertebra forces while keeping a good
   correction.
   Conclusion. Biomechanically, it is possible to significantly improve the
   correction of thoracic scoliotic deformities, particularly in the
   transverse plane, when using vertebral derotation maneuvers.}},

Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{24}},

Month = {{JAN 11}},
Abstract = {{We investigate quantum nanosensors based on hybrid systems consisting of
   semiconductor quantum dots and metallic nanorods in the near-infrared
   regime. These sensors can detect biological and chemical substances
   based on their impact on the coherent exciton-plasmon coupling and
   molecular resonances supported by such systems when they interact with a
   laser field. We demonstrate that the ultrahigh sensitivity of such
   molecular resonances on environmental conditions allows dramatic and
   nearly instantaneous changes in the total field experienced by the
   semiconductor quantum dot via minuscule variations of the local
   refractive indices of the quantum dot or nanorod. The proposed
   nanosensors can utilize quantum effects to control the sense ( or
   direction) of the changes in the quantum dot emission, allowing us to
   have bistable switching from dark to bright states or vice versa via
   adsorption ( or detachment) of biomolecules. These sensors can also
   offer detection of ultra-small variations in the local dielectric
   constant of the quantum dots or metallic nanorods via coherent induction
   of time delays in the effective field experienced by the quantum dots
   when the hybrid systems interact with time-dependent laser fields. This
   leads to unprecedented bulk refractive index sensitivities. Our results
   show that one can utilize quantum phase to control the coherent
   exciton-plasmon dynamics in these sensors such that introduction of a
   biomolecule can increase or decrease the time delay. These results offer
   novel ways to detect single biomolecules via application of quantum
   coherence to convert their impact into spectacular optical events.}},

Abstract = {{Background: This paper presents a method that registers MRIs acquired in
   prone position, with surface topography (TP) and X-ray reconstructions
   acquired in standing position, in order to obtain a 3D representation of
   a human torso incorporating the external surface, bone structures, and
   soft tissues.
   Methods: TP and X-ray data are registered using landmarks. Bone
   structures are used to register each MRI slice using an articulated
   model, and the soft tissue is confined to the volume delimited by the
   trunk and bone surfaces using a constrained thin-plate spline.
   Results: The method is tested on 3 pre-surgical patients with scoliosis
   and shows a significant improvement, qualitatively and using the Dice
   similarity coefficient, in fitting the MRI into the standing patient
   model when compared to rigid and articulated model registration. The
   determinant of the Jacobian of the registration deformation shows higher
   variations in the deformation in areas closer to the surface of the
   torso.
   Conclusions: The novel, resulting 3D full torso model can provide a more
   complete representation of patient geometry to be incorporated in
   surgical simulators under development that aim at predicting the effect
   of scoliosis surgery on the external appearance of the patient's torso.}},

Abstract = {{The quality of process data in continuous-process industries
   significantly affects the performance and profit to be gained from
   optimization, control, or cost modelling. Unfortunately, data inherently
   contain inaccurate information because measurements are obtained with
   imperfect instruments. In addition, the data may reflect the influence
   of ambient factors and a lack of sufficient instrumentation. Within the
   last couple of decades, many data-cleaning techniques have been
   presented to solve this problem. The papermaking industry faces many
   challenges in implementing these techniques. These are mostly due to the
   complexity of the production processes, the unavailability of suitable
   sensors, and the lack of installed instrumentation. The variables
   monitored and stored to ensure mill safety and control are often too few
   for model-based data validation procedures such as data reconciliation.
   This paper presents a practical methodology that overcomes the problem
   of low redundancy in the pulp and paper operation and helps to validate
   plant-wide pseudo-steady-state data sets for cost modelling. There are
   tremendous opportunities to use these data sets effectively in practical
   decision-making related to process operation or design by modelling the
   link between business and lower-level process data. By doing this,
   decision-makers on a supervisory level will gain improved knowledge of
   their operation from both a process and a cost perspective.}},

Abstract = {{Tracking of a catheter through the arterial system is critical in
   several medical interventions. To avoid excessive dose of x-ray
   irradiation, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been proposed. In such
   a case, a simple ferromagnetic sphere placed at the tip of the catheter
   could be used. However, due to the artifact created by the ferromagnetic
   core, it becomes impossible to gather an image of the tissues
   surrounding such a marker. Hence, in this paper we propose replacing the
   ferromagnetic marker with a microchip containing a coil and a
   photovoltaic cell. By radiating light to the photovoltaic cell, the coil
   generates a magnetic field which is detected as an artifact in MR
   images. By turning off the light, the effect of the coil is eliminated
   allowing images of tissues next to the marker to be taken. In this
   paper, simulated results based on experimental data from the preliminary
   designs suggest that this approach could be viable not only for
   catheters but also, it could potentially be used in various tools as
   well as mechatronic devices being moved inside the body.}},

Abstract = {{In this chapter we focus on a novel boosting development of organic
   electronics that exploits the mixed electronic and ionic conduction that
   certain organic materials can sustain, to produce a wide range of
   devices with potential applications in bioelectronics. Examples of such
   devices are organic electrochemical transistors and miniaturized
   bio-laboratories making use of conducting polymers, whose
   physico-chemical properties are controlled electronically. Organic
   electrochemical transistors can be operated in aqueous environment as
   efficient ion-to-electron converters, thus providing an interface
   between the worlds of biology and electronics. For this reason, they
   present exciting opportunities for applications in biosensing.
   Biocompatible organic conducting polymers able to operate in aqueous
   environment can be interfaced with biological systems. By exploiting
   conducting polymer properties such as electrochemical switching and
   combined electronic and ionic transport, it is possible to use the
   polymers as platforms where cells can adhere and proliferate.}},

Abstract = {{One of the central problems in computer vision is the detection of
   semantically important objects and the estimation of their pose. Most of
   the work in object detection has been based on single image processing
   and its performance is limited by occlusions and ambiguity in appearance
   and geometry. This paper proposes an active approach to object detection
   by controlling the point of view of a mobile depth camera. When an
   initial static detection phase identifies an object of interest, several
   hypotheses are made about its class and orientation. The sensor then
   plans a sequence of viewpoints, which balances the amount of energy used
   to move with the chance of identifying the correct hypothesis. We
   formulate an active M-ary hypothesis testing problem, which includes
   sensor mobility, and solve it using a point-based approximate POMDP
   algorithm. The validity of our approach is verified through simulation
   and experiments with real scenes captured by a kinect sensor. The
   results suggest a significant improvement over static object detection.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, there has been a remarkable growth of the Internet
   energy consumption, which is expected to persist in the future at an
   even higher pace. At the same time the network access capacity of
   individual subscribers is rapidly reaching values high enough to move
   the traffic bottleneck from the access network to the core network in
   most scenarios. This will soon make the elastic nature of traffic an
   important aspect of network resource management and will require a
   redesign of the energy-aware traffic engineering techniques so far based
   on inelastic traffic demands.
   We propose a novel optimization approach to select a routing path for
   each elastic traffic demand and decide which routers and links to put to
   sleep so as to maximize a network utility measure depending on the
   traffic demand rates, while satisfying a constraint on the total energy
   consumption. Bandwidth is allocated to each elastic demand according to
   the Max-Min Fairness (MMF) paradigm, which approximates the resource
   allocation of the transport layer.}},

Abstract = {{A large proportion of reinforced concrete structures are cracked and
   subjected to cyclic loading in service. The presence of cracks enhances
   the ingress of aggressive agents into the concrete, resulting in faster
   structure deterioration. On the other hand, crack self-healing and
   inclusion of fibers in concrete can improve structure durability.
   Self-healing under constant loading is a well-known phenomenon; however,
   the possibility for self-healing to occur under cyclic loading has
   received insufficient attention. This study used an innovative
   permeability device to investigate the water permeability of reinforced
   normal-strength concrete (NSC) and fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC)
   simultaneously subjected to tensile cyclic loading. Complementary
   mechanical tests were performed under the same loading procedure to
   assess the crack-pattern evolution. The experimental results showed
   that, at an equivalent stress level in the reinforcement, the water
   permeability was significantly lower in the FRC than in the NSC-both
   under constant and cyclic loading. Moreover, two opposite phenomena
   occurred during cyclic loading: crack propagation and self-healing. In
   the NSC, the self-healing, which occurred under cyclic loading,
   compensated for the increase of permeability resulting from the crack
   propagation. In the FRC, crack growth was minor; therefore, the
   self-healing was not affected by the cyclic loading and may have even
   been promoted in comparison to self-healing under constant loading. The
   results emphasize the benefit of using FRC in structures.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents and discusses some of the recent developments on
   60 GHz antenna arrays in substrate integrated waveguide (SIW)
   technology. They include planar linearly polarized (LP) antenna, three
   dimensional (3-D) high gain LP antenna, multi-layer single circularly
   polarized (CP) antenna, and 3-D dual circularly polarized antenna (DCP)
   over 60 GHz frequency range. Single LP antenna is realized by loading
   antipodal linearly tapered slot antenna (ALTSA) with dielectric rod
   antenna. The dielectric rod antenna is used as a radiating element to
   construct 4 x 4 antenna array. Single right-hand circularly polarized
   (RHCP) antenna is constructed by using SIW as feeding network and CP
   patch as radiating element. 2 x 2 RHCP array makes use of an aperture
   coupling method to excite each antenna element. In the final prototype,
   DCP antenna is constructed by using multi-layer E-plane coupler and rod
   radiating element. All the proposed antenna arrays are experimentally
   validated and compared with the simulated counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{Any application, database server, telephony server, or operating system
   maintains different states for their internal elements and resources.
   When tracing is enabled on such systems, the corresponding events in the
   trace logs can be used to extract and model the different state values
   of the traced modules to analyze their runtime behavior. In this paper,
   a generic method and corresponding data structures are proposed to model
   and manage the system state values, allowing efficient storage and
   access. The proposed state organization mechanism generates state
   intervals from trace events and stores them in a tree-based state
   history database. The state history database can then be used to extract
   the state of any system resources (i.e. cpu, process, memory, file,
   etc.) at any timestamp. The extracted state values can be used to track
   system problems (e. g. performance degradation). The proposed system is
   usable in both the offline tracing mode, when there is a set of trace
   files, and online tracing mode, when there is a stream of trace events.
   The proposed system has been implemented and used to display and analyze
   interactively various information extracted from very large traces in
   the magnitude order of 1 TB.}},

Abstract = {{This paper classifies periodic leaky-wave antennas (LWAs) into four
   groups based on the symmetries or asymmetries of their unit cell. It
   first presents the fundamental properties and limitations of LWAs whose
   unit cell is symmetric with respect to both the longitudinal (long.) and
   transversal (trans.) axes, which constitutes the first group. It next
   shows that breaking the symmetry with respect to the long. axis, which
   leads to the second group, allows to equalize the antenna gain through
   broadside. This group is generally elliptically polarized. The third
   group is formed by breaking the symmetry with respect to the trans.
   axis. Here, the degree of asymmetry is a powerful design parameter to
   selectively control the LWA characteristics at broadside while
   maintaining linear polarization. Finally, it speculates on the
   characteristics on the last group, that is currently under
   investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Autonomic computing was proposed as a promising solution to overcome the
   complexity of modern systems, which is causing management operations to
   become increasingly difficult for human beings. This work proposes the
   Adaptation Manager, a comprehensive framework to implement autonomic
   managers capable of pursuing some of the objectives of autonomic
   computing (i.e., self-optimization and self-healing). The Adaptation
   Manager features an active performance monitoring infrastructure and two
   dynamic knobs to tune the scheduling decisions of an operating system
   and the working frequency of cores. The Adaptation Manager exploits
   artificial intelligence and reinforcement learning to close the
   Monitor-Plan-AnalyzeExecute with Knowledge adaptation loop at the very
   base of every autonomic manager. We evaluate the Adaptation Manager, and
   especially the adaptation policies it learns by means of reinforcement
   learning, using a set of representative applications for multicore
   processors and show the effectiveness of our prototype on commodity
   computing systems.}},

Abstract = {{Release engineering deals with all activities in between regular
   development and actual usage of a software product by the end user,
   i.e., integration, build, test execution, packaging and delivery of
   software. Although research on this topic goes back for decades, the
   increasing heterogeneity and variability of software products along with
   the recent trend to reduce the release cycle to days or even hours
   starts to question some of the common beliefs and practices of the
   field. For example, a project like Mozilla Firefox releases every 6
   weeks, generating updates for dozens of existing Firefox versions on 5
   desktop, 2 mobile and 3 mobile desktop platforms, each of which for more
   than 80 locales. In this context, the International Workshop on Release
   Engineering (RELENG) aims to provide a highly interactive forum for
   researchers and practitioners to address the challenges of, find
   solutions for and share experiences with release engineering, and to
   build connections between the various communities.}},

Abstract = {{Granular filtration remains a key barrier for Cryptosporidium removal in
   water treatment plants without UV irradiation. To assess the impact of
   clay particles in source water on Cryptosporidium removal efficiency by
   granular filtration, this study investigated the co-transport of
   Cryptosporidium-sized microspheres and kaolinite particles in sand
   columns. To investigate the influence of clay load on microsphere
   transport and deposition, varying influent kaolinite concentrations
   (0-10(6) particles/mL) and microsphere concentrations (10(2)-10(6)
   microspheres/mL) were tested. The spatial distribution of retained
   microspheres was examined subsequent to experiments via filter coring.
   Results demonstrate that increasing the influent microsphere
   concentration impaired filter performance due to a blocking mechanism
   whereby previously retained particles repel incoming particles. In
   contrast, when the particulate load was dominated by kaolinite (for an
   equivalent particulate load), filter performance improved as a result of
   filter ripening whereby previously deposited particles act as additional
   collectors. Thus, microsphere-kaolinite interactions proved to be
   favorable although both particles possessed negative zeta potentials in
   the tested conditions. This study demonstrates that granular filter
   performance is vulnerable to peak events of microbial contamination.
   Conversely, Cryptosporidium-sized microsphere removal by granular
   filtration is enhanced in the presence of kaolinite in source water.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work the nonlinear optical response of some AuxAg(1-x)
   alloy nanoparticles (NPs) prepared by a femtosecond laser ablation
   process is studied using Z-scan technique employing 4 ns, 532 nm laser
   pulses. The prepared NPs with diameters of 15 - 20 nm, had different
   compositions, i.e. gold molar fractions (GMF) x, ranging from x = 0
   (pure Ag) to x = 1 (pure Au) and they were exhibiting surface plasmon
   resonance (SPR) peak whose spectral position and strength were varying
   depending on GMF. The AuxAg(1-x) NPs were found to exhibit negative
   nonlinear refraction, corresponding to self-defocusing behavior and
   negligible nonlinear absorption. The nonlinear optical response of the
   AuxAg(1-x) alloy nanoparticles was found to be strongly dependent on the
   GMF of the nanoalloy, since the surface plasmon resonance peak enhances
   the nonlinear optical response of the metallic nanoalloys when it is
   close to the excitation wavelength.}},

Abstract = {{For many years, researchers and practitioners have strived to assess and
   improve the productivity of software development teams. One key step
   toward achieving this goal is the understanding of factors affecting the
   efficiency of developers performing development and maintenance
   activities. In this paper, we aim to understand how developers' spend
   their effort during maintenance activities and study the factors
   affecting developers' effort. By knowing how developers' spend their
   effort and which factors affect their effort, software organisations
   will be able to take the necessary steps to improve the efficiency of
   their developers, for example, by providing them with adequate program
   comprehension tools. For this preliminary study, we mine 2,408
   developers' interaction histories and 3,395 patches from four
   open-source software projects (ECF, Mylyn, PDE, Eclipse Platform). We
   observe that usually, the complexity of the implementation required for
   a task does not reflect the effort spent by developers on the task. Most
   of the effort appears to be spent during the exploration of the program.
   In average, 62\% of files explored during the implementation of a task
   are not significantly relevant to the final implementation of the task.
   Developers who explore a large number of files that are not
   significantly relevant to the solution to their task take a longer time
   to perform the task. We expect that the results of this study will pave
   the way for better program comprehension tools to guide developers
   during their explorations of software systems.}},

Abstract = {{Anti-patterns describe poor solutions to design and implementation
   problems which are claimed to make object oriented systems hard to
   maintain. Anti-patterns indicate weaknesses in design that may slow down
   development or increase the risk of faults or failures in the future.
   Classes in anti-patterns have some dependencies, such as static
   relationships, that may propagate potential problems to other classes.
   To the best of our knowledge, the relationship between anti-patterns
   dependencies (with non anti-patterns classes) and faults has yet to be
   studied in details. This paper presents the results of an empirical
   study aimed at analysing anti-patterns dependencies in three open source
   software systems, namely ArgoUML, JFreeChart, and XerecesJ. We show
   that, in almost all releases of the three systems, classes having
   dependencies with anti-patterns are more fault-prone than others. We
   also report other observations about these dependencies such as their
   impact on fault prediction. Software organizations could make use of
   these knowledge about anti-patterns dependencies to better focus their
   testing and reviews activities toward the most risky classes, e. g.,
   classes with fault-prone dependencies with anti-patterns.}},

Abstract = {{When developers perform a maintenance task, they follow an exploration
   strategy (ES) that is characterised by how they navigate through the
   program entities. Studying ES can help to assess how developers
   understand a program and perform a change task. Various factors could
   influence how developers explore a program and the way in which they
   explore a program may affect their performance for a certain task. In
   this paper, we investigate the ES followed by developers during
   maintenance tasks and assess the impact of these ES on the duration and
   effort spent by developers on the tasks. We want to know if developers
   frequently revisit one (or a set) of program entities (referenced
   exploration), or if they visit program entities with almost the same
   frequency (unreferenced exploration) when performing a maintenance task.
   We mine 1,705 Mylyn interaction histories (IH) from four open-source
   projects (ECF, Mylyn, PDE, and Eclipse Platform) and perform a user
   study to verify if both referenced exploration (RE) and unreferenced
   exploration (UE) were followed by some developers. Using the Gini
   inequality index on the number of revisits of program entities, we
   automatically classify interaction histories as RE and UE and perform an
   empirical study to measure the effect of program exploration on the task
   duration and effort. We report that, although a UE may require more
   exploration effort than a RE, a UE is on average 12.30\% less time
   consuming than a RE.}},

Abstract = {{Software development knowledge resides in the source code and in a
   number of other artefacts produced during the development process. To
   extract such a knowledge, past software engineering research has
   extensively focused on mining the source code, i.e., the final product
   of the development effort. Currently, we witness an emerging trend where
   researchers strive to exploit the information captured in artifacts such
   as emails and bug reports, free-form text requirements and
   specifications, comments and identifiers. Being often expressed in
   natural language, and not having a well-defined structure, the
   information stored in these artifacts is defined as unstructured data.
   Although research communities in Information Retrieval, Data Mining and
   Natural Language Processing have devised techniques to deal with
   unstructured data, these techniques are usually limited in scope (i.e.,
   designed for English language text found in newspaper articles) and
   intended for use in specific scenarios, thus failing to achieve their
   full potential in a software development context. The workshop on Mining
   Unstructured Data (MUD) aims to provide a common venue for researchers
   and practitioners across software engineering, information retrieval and
   data mining research domains, to share new approaches and emerging
   results in mining unstructured data.}},

Abstract = {{Unconditional consensus is the property of a consensus algorithm for
   multiple agents, to produce consensus irrespective of the particular
   time or state at which the agent states are initialized. Under a weak
   condition, so-called balanced asymmetry, on the sequence (A(n)) of
   stochastic matrices in the agents states update algorithm, it is shown
   that (i) the set of accumulation points of states as n grows large is
   finite, (ii) the asymptotic unconditional occurrence of single consensus
   or multiple consensuses is directly related to the property of absolute
   infinite flow of this sequence, as introduced by Touri and Nedic. The
   latter condition must be satisfied on each of the islands of the
   so-called unbounded interactions graph induced by (A(n)), as defined by
   Hendrickx et al. The property of balanced asymmetry is satisfied by many
   of the well known discrete time consensus models studied in the

   seeking has been proposed recently for noise-free nonlinear continuous

   This paper is the extension of the mentioned algorithm to globally

Abstract = {{Control of crystallization processes in order to obtain desired product
   specifications is very critical in pharmaceutical industries, as it
   influences not only the efficiency of the other downstream processes but
   also the bioavailability of the drug. Hence, motivated to counter the
   pragmatic limitations of implementing the optimal control policies in
   the presence of plant-model mismatch, measurement-based optimization
   (MBO) schemes for real-time optimal operation of (semi-)batch
   pharmaceutical antisolvent crystallization processes has been presented
   in this paper. MBO schemes are based on tracking the Necessary
   Conditions of Optimality (NCO), usually a sequence of boundary and (or)
   interior arcs, using measurement feedback. The current study explores
   this approach by designing neighboring extremal (NE) controller to
   follow the optimal trajectory in the interior arcs during the real-time
   optimal control. Furthermore, performance assessment of the NE
   controller is done by comparing to different control strategies for
   various scenarios of plant model mismatch.}},

Abstract = {{The delineation of tumor boundaries in medical images is an essential
   task for the early detection, diagnosis and follow-up of cancer. However
   accurate segmentation remains challenging due to presence of noise,
   inhomogeneity and high appearance variability of malignant tissue. In
   this paper, we propose an automatic segmentation approach using
   fully-connected higher-order conditional random fields (HOCRF) where
   potentials are computed within a discriminant Grassmannian manifold.
   First, the framework learns within-class and between-class similarity
   distributions from a training set of images to discover the optimal
   manifold discrimination between normal and pathological tissues. Second,
   the conditional optimization scheme computes non-local pairwise as well
   as pattern-based higher-order potentials from the manifold subspace to
   recognize regions with similar labelings and incorporate global
   consistency in the inference process. Our HOCRF framework is applied in
   the context of metastatic liver tumor segmentation in CT images.
   Compared to state of the art methods, our method achieves better
   performance on a group of 30 liver tumors and can deal with highly
   pathological cases.}},

Abstract = {{Large open and closed source organizations like Google, Facebook and
   Mozilla are migrating their products towards rapid releases. While this
   allows faster time-to-market and user feedback, it also implies less
   time for testing and bug fixing. Since initial research results indeed
   show that rapid releases fix proportionally less reported bugs than
   traditional releases, this paper investigates the changes in software
   testing effort after moving to rapid releases. We analyze the results of
   312,502 execution runs of the 1,547 mostly manual system-level test
   cases of Mozilla Firefox from 2006 to 2012 (5 major traditional and 9
   major rapid releases), and triangulated our findings with a Mozilla QA
   engineer. In rapid releases, testing has a narrower scope that enables
   deeper investigation of the features and regressions with the highest
   risk, while traditional releases run the whole test suite. Furthermore,
   rapid releases make it more difficult to build a large testing
   community, forcing Mozilla to increase contractor resources in order to
   sustain testing for rapid releases.}},

Abstract = {{Bug prediction models are often used to help allocate software quality
   assurance efforts. Software metrics (e. g., process metrics and product
   metrics) are at the heart of bug prediction models. However, some of
   these metrics like churn are not actionable; on the contrary,
   antipatterns which refer to specific design and implementation styles
   can tell the developers whether a design choice is ``poor{''} or not.
   Poor designs can be fixed by refactoring. Therefore in this paper, we
   explore the use of antipatterns for bug prediction, and strive to
   improve the accuracy of bug prediction models by proposing various
   metrics based on antipatterns. An additional feature to our proposed
   metrics is that they take into account the history of antipatterns in
   files from their inception into the system. Through a case study on
   multiple versions of Eclipse and ArgoUML, we observe that (i) files
   participating in antipatterns have higher bug density than other files;
   (ii) our proposed antipattern based metrics can provide additional
   explanatory power over traditional metrics, and (iii) improve the
   F-measure of cross-system bug prediction models by 12.5\% in average.
   Managers and quality assurance personnel can use our proposed metrics to
   better improve their bug prediction models and better focus testing
   activities and the allocation of support resources.}},

Abstract = {{Software metrics have many uses, e. g., defect prediction, effort
   estimation, and benchmarking an organization against peers and industry
   standards. In all these cases, metrics may depend on the context, such
   as the programming language. Here we aim to investigate if the
   distributions of commonly used metrics do, in fact, vary with six
   context factors: application domain, programming language, age,
   lifespan, the number of changes, and the number of downloads. For this
   preliminary study we select 320 nontrivial software systems from
   Source-Forge. These software systems are randomly sampled from nine
   popular application domains of Source-Forge. We calculate 39 metrics
   commonly used to assess software maintainability for each software
   system and use Kruskal Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test to determine
   if there are significant differences among the distributions with
   respect to each of the six context factors. We use Cliff's delta to
   measure the magnitude of the differences and find that all six context
   factors affect the distribution of 20 metrics and the programming
   language factor affects 35 metrics. We also briefly discuss how each
   context factor may affect the distribution of metric values. We expect
   our results to help software benchmarking and other software engineering
   methods that rely on these commonly used metrics to be tailored to a
   particular context.}},

   scanning array antennas and propose a simple and yet effective method to
   recover target cross-range resolution beyond the beamwidth limitations.
   First, the frequency scanning antenna signal model is presented and then
   a new superresolution technique for frequency scanning signals is
   explained. This method uses the nonlinear relation between frequency
   variation and pointing angle of the antenna and achieves a resolution
   equal to the angular steps chosen for scanning the field of view. For
   instance, using an antenna with the -3dB beamwidth of seven degrees and
   scanning steps of one degree, we achieve a resolution of one degree
   under various noise conditions. The validity of the proposed method and
   the resulting performance in the presence of noise are demonstrated by

   detailed analysis of driving behavior, trajectory interpretation, and
   conflict measures in modern North American roundabouts, based on video
   data extracted by means of computer vision. The analysis explores the
   methods used to prepare microscopic speed maps, compiled speed profiles,
   lane-change counts, and gap time measures. The paper introduces and
   discusses the interpretation of trajectories at the scale of roundabout
   merge sections instead of looking at safety from the point of view of a
   roundabout as a unified system. The research found significant variation
   in distributions of speed across five case study roundabouts in the
   province of Quebec, Canada; this result may be explained by regional
   differences in design and road use. The paper also found aggressive gap
   times and uneven traffic flow as contributing factors to speed.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most attractive features considered by the recent LTE-A
   standard is the introduction of femtocells in its main architecture.
   Rapidly, femtocell technology has been recognized as a potential
   solution to offload cellular networks since its deployment is expected
   to grow up considerably in the near future. However, the small coverage
   of femtocells may lead to frequent handoffs that need permanent support
   of the core network. Hence, to ensure seamless handovers through such
   networks, local mobility management remains an important task to be
   addressed. In this paper, we propose an efficient X2-based local
   mobility scheme that allows mobile users to perform handovers with
   minimum signaling load compared to the mobility procedures proposed in
   the 3GPP LTE-A standard.}},

   consider the distribution networks as composed of lines and cables. In
   this paper, a general technique is demonstrated in order to handle other

   transformers and regulators as state variables in the estimation process
   given that they are rarely telemetered.
   The performance of iterative optimization algorithms depends strongly on
   the initial solution. In this paper, the load allocation algorithm is
   used in order to obtain an initial solution and associate loads with
   pseudo-measurements. The latter step is necessary in order to assure
   observability of the network. The load allocation algorithm used in this

Abstract = {{This paper shows the effect of neurotransmitter concentrations on the
   local conductivity and impedance of the cerebrospinal fluid in addition
   to their biological effects. Three neurotransmitters are studied:
   glutamate and gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), which are the major
   excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters respectively, and dopamine,
   which is involved in many psychiatric disorders such as Parkinson's
   disease, drug's addiction and schizophrenia. We used different
   concentrations of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) since its
   conductivity is too high. Obtained results prove that neurotransmitter
   concentration can be detected by sensing the conductivity and the
   impedance of the ACSF. Indeed, when the glutamate concentration
   increases from 6 mM to 58 mM the conductivity of 0.5\% ACSF jumps from
   0.03 S/m to 0.07 S/m while its impedance decreases from 2.8 k Omega to
   1.5 k Omega. However, GABA concentration does not affect the
   conductivity of the ACSF but we observed a significant decrease of
   impedance of the 0.5\% ACSF solution from 6.5 k Omega to 4 k Omega when
   GABA concentration increases from 5 mM to 500 mM. In the case of
   dopamine hydrochloride, an important change of conductivity and
   impedance is observed with 10\% ACSF solution which varies from 0.3 S/m
   to 1.2 S/m and from 460 Omega to 200 k Omega respectively when the
   dopamine concentration drops from 5 mM to 100 mM}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},

Pages = {{3079-3085}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this paper was to investigate the feasibility of using gamma
   irradiation to inhibit the microbial activity of biological powder
   activated carbon (PAC) without impacting its adsorptive properties.
   First of all, the range of dose of gamma rays required to produce
   abiotic PAC was selected on the basis of heterotrophic plate counts
   (HPC) inactivation and methylene blue (MB) adsorption kinetics. Doses
   inferior to 10 kGy were not sufficient to inhibit the culture of
   heterotrophic bacteria. On the other hand, doses superior to 15 kGy were
   demonstrated to affect the adsorption rate of MB. Consequently, a dose
   comprised between 10 and 15 kGy was selected for further investigation.
   In order to validate the adequacy of the range of dose (i.e. 10-15 kGy),
   adsorption characteristics were tested by monitoring the removal
   kinetics of refractory dissolved organic carbon (RDOC). No significant
   differences were observed between irradiated and non-irradiated
   biological PAC for the adsorption of RDOC. Irradiated, non-irradiated
   and virgin PAC were also evaluated in terms of abundance of viable
   (using the LIVE/DEAD BacLight (TM) method) bacteria and in terms of
   heterotrophic biomass activity. The results of the BacLight (TM) method
   demonstrated that attachment of the biofilm on the PAC was not impacted
   by the irradiation and heterotrophic activity measurements demonstrated
   that the latter could be radically reduced in the range of dose
   selected. In conclusion, when using a proper dose, the gamma irradiation
   of colonized activated carbon drastically reduced the heterotrophic
   activity on activated carbon without significantly impacting its
   adsorptive behaviour.}},

   viscosity data are reviewed for melts formed by MnO with SiO2, Al2O3,

Abstract = {{Throughout the life cycle of an aircraft, its avionic architecture can
   be updated or re-configured leading to what we call the iterative
   integration problem. In particular, new avionics functions of mixed
   criticality must be added to computation modules. This can cause a
   modification of the scheduling parameters, inducing a re-certification
   of modules, whose cost depends on the criticality level of the modified
   functions. We define a new approach to help the system designer in
   producing a proper modified scheduling at a minimal cost while
   satisfying some realtime constraints. The emphasis is put on the
   iterative process and we focus on Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA)
   architecture supported by a time-triggered network. First, we give a
   general formalization of the problem and provide some results on the
   realtime constraints considered. In particular, we show how they can
   directly be taken into account in the variable domains. Then, our
   approach consists in formalizing the problem as a Binary Integer
   Problem. Thus, using an off-the-shelf solver, an optimal scheduling
   minimizing the cost can be automatically determined.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a millimeter wave 2x2 MIMO (Multiple-Input
   Multiple-Output) six-port based architecture is proposed and analyzed.
   This line-of-sight MIMO configuration doubles the data rate without
   increasing channel bandwidth and exploits spatial diversity. In the
   system analysis, two pseudo-random BPSK signals of 2 Gb/s data rate are
   transmitted on two MIMO orthogonal channels. The inherent MIMO spatial
   and additional quadrature diversity (due to six-port interferometry)
   allows improvements in bit error rate (BER) when the distance changes
   versus the optimal Rayleigh value. The six-port receivers are modelled
   in advanced system simulations using on-wafer S-parameter measurements
   on a fabricated prototype.}},

Abstract = {{With the increasing significance of the service-oriented paradigm for
   implementing business solutions, assessing and analyzing such solutions
   also becomes an essential task to ensure and improve their quality of
   design. One way to develop such solutions, a.k.a., Service-Based systems
   (SBSs) is to generate BPEL (Business Process Execution Language)
   processes via orchestrating Web services. Development of large business
   processes (BPs) involves design decisions. Improper and wrong design
   decisions in software engineering are commonly known as antipatterns,
   i.e., poor solutions that might affect the quality of design. The
   detection of antipatterns is thus important to ensure and improve the
   quality of BPs. However, although BP antipatterns have been defined in
   the literature, no effort was given to detect such antipatterns within
   BPEL processes. With the aim of improving the design and quality of BPEL
   processes, we propose the first rule-based approach to specify and
   detect BP antipatterns. We specify 7 BP antipatterns from the literature
   and perform the detection for 4 of them in an initial experiment with 3
   BPEL processes.}},

Abstract = {{A technique for achieving simultaneous multiple scanned directional
   beams is introduced in the substrate integrated waveguide (SIW)
   technology. In the first part, a two-port leaky-wave antenna (LWA)
   having broad-side radiating characteristics from -30 degrees to +30
   degrees scan angle with 45 degrees polarization is proposed. The phase
   scanning principle of beam forming network (BFN) and the frequency
   scanning principle of LWA are both utilized to implement 2-D scan
   multi-beam antenna (MBA) array. In the second part, two layer Butler
   matrix based BFN is proposed to extend the 2-D MBA capability to operate
   as simultaneous two-way transmit or two-way receive MBA array. In this
   configuration, one of the beams is dedicated for transmit operation
   while the other beam is dedicated for receive operation simultaneously.
   In the third part, beam scanning range is further extended to cover
   full-plane region by placing two independent MBAs orthogonal to each
   other. The proposed and demonstrated E-band phased array system can be
   used in future intelligent communication or transportation system. This
   concept can easily be scalable up to W-band frequency range and beyond.}},

   radar-communication functions is proposed and developed based on a
   multiport interferometer technique. Following a recently developed
   time-agile waveform modulation scheme, this transceiver is made simpler,

   a specially proposed six-port topology used in the receiver design. With
   a theoretical analysis of its operation principles, the functionality of
   transceiver is studied through preliminary system-level measurements.
   The system is able to estimate target's range, angular position,
   velocity and direction of motion when operating in radar mode. Moreover,
   it is also capable of operating as a wireless data communicator. When
   the system operates in joint radar-communication manner, sensory-data
   fusion can enhance the reception quality of data transmission. These
   features make the proposed scheme suitable for intelligent

   integrated waveguide (SIW) is designed and experimentally verified.
   Common to regular SIW circuits is a low-permittivity substrate, whereas

   commercially available field solvers are used in a parametric study to
   optimize the interconnect over a wide bandwidth between 18 GHz and 28

   individual interconnect achieves return and insertion losses better than

   connection with image SINRD (iSINRD) guide and SIW is exploited to
   develop a planar millimeter-wave hybrid orthogonal-mode transducer (OMT)
   within the same dielectric substrate layer. The two output arms are
   related to an iSINRD guide and an SIW. The proposed co-layered planar
   OMT belongs to a narrowband acute angle class. The design process is
   explained and measurements at 94 GHz are presented. No septa or step
   changes in thickness are required. Both modes are excited using WR10
   transitions where the transition of one mode is orthogonal to the other.
   Therefore, the OMT is fabricated as a back-to-back 4-port OMT; two
   inputs and two outputs for each mode respectively. The lateral
   dimensions of all branching arms are 0.6x0.635 mm(2). An insertion loss
   of around 1.2 dB is obtained for both LSM10 and TE10 modes, while
   isolation better than 17 dB is obtained for both modes (30 dB for the

   Active components are surface-mounted on alumina substrate utilizing
   miniature hybrid microwave-integrated circuit (MHMIC) technology. To
   increase gain and bandwidth of the antenna, and also to reduce
   fabrication cost, antenna and passive components are designed and
   fabricated on a low cost Rogers 6002 substrate with low dielectric
   constant. To fabricate the passive components, low cost printed circuit
   board (PCB) process is used. Then, the two substrates are integrated
   together by simple wire bonding process. With this design and
   implementation technique, our E-band front-end receiver subsystem can
   demonstrate attractive advantages and features such as broad bandwidth,
   low cost, compact size, light weight, and repayable performance. The

Abstract = {{In this paper, compact filters with independent control of center
   frequency and bandwidth are proposed. Center frequency tuning is
   realized by changing the electric length of varactor diode loaded
   resonators, bandwidth reconfiguration is achieved through a convenient
   way to control the inter-resonator coupling by switching on/off narrow
   strips connecting two resonators at different positions while good
   matching for widely variable bandwidth status is enabled by tapped input
   combined with variable capacitance or variable inductance, i.e.,
   variable admittance inverter to control external coupling. Quarter
   wavelength stepped impedance resonator allows for constant absolute
   bandwidth (ABW) tuning over large tuning ranges from 1.178 GHz to 3.6GHz
   (for the widest bandwidth only), widely variable bandwidth states from
   140MHz to 1.4GHz is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a millimeter wave 2x2 MIMO (Multiple-Input
   Multiple-Output) six-port based architecture is proposed and analyzed.
   This line-of-sight MIMO configuration doubles the data rate without
   increasing channel bandwidth and exploits spatial diversity. In the
   system analysis, two pseudorandom BPSK signals of 2 Gb/s data rate are
   transmitted on two MIMO orthogonal channels. The inherent MIMO spatial
   and additional quadrature diversity (due to six-port interferometry)
   allows improvements in bit error rate (BER) when the distance changes
   versus the optimal Rayleigh value. The six-port receivers are modelled
   in advanced system simulations using on-wafer S-parameter measurements

Abstract = {{A technique for achieving simultaneous multiple scanned directional
   beams is introduced in the substrate integrated waveguide (SIW)
   technology. In the first part, a two-port leaky-wave antenna (LWA)
   having broad-side radiating characteristics from -30 degrees to +30
   degrees scan angle with 45 degrees polarization is proposed. The phase
   scanning principle of beam forming network (BFN) and the frequency
   scanning principle of LWA are both utilized to implement 2-D scan
   multi-beam antenna (MBA) array. In the second part, two layer Butler
   matrix based BFN is proposed to extend the 2-D MBA capability to operate
   as simultaneous two-way transmit or two-way receive MBA array. In this
   configuration, one of the beams is dedicated for transmit operation
   while the other beam is dedicated for receive operation simultaneously.
   In the third part, beam scanning range is further extended to cover
   full-plane region by placing two independent MBAs orthogonal to each
   other. The proposed and demonstrated E-band phased array system can be
   used in future intelligent communication or transportation system. This
   concept can easily be scalable up to W-band frequency range and beyond.}},

Abstract = {{A multifunctional transceiver architecture in support of joint
   radar-communication functions is proposed and developed based on a
   multiport interferometer technique. Following a recently developed
   time-agile waveform modulation scheme, this transceiver is made simpler,

   a specially proposed six-port topology used in the receiver design. With
   a theoretical analysis of its operation principles, the functionality of
   transceiver is studied through preliminary system-level measurements.
   The system is able to estimate target's range, angular position,
   velocity and direction of motion when operating in radar mode. Moreover,
   it is also capable of operating as a wireless data communicator. When
   the system operates in joint radar-communication manner, sensory-data
   fusion can enhance the reception quality of data transmission. These
   features make the proposed scheme suitable for intelligent

   matched keypoints are used in order to find the homography

   of registration is formulated as correspondences between noisy polygon
   vertices. Sections of polygons are matched locally to find the
   corresponding vertices inside a frame. These correspondences are then
   accumulated temporally using a reservoir of matches for homography

Pages = {{47-57}},
Abstract = {{An integrated intervening opportunities model (IIOM) was developed for
   public transit (PT) trips. This model is generation distribution and
   supply-dependent, with single constraints only on trip production values
   for work and study PT trips made during morning peak hours (6:00 to 9:00
   a.m.) within the Island of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Several data sets,
   including the 2008 origin destination survey of the Greater Montreal
   Area, 2006 census of Canada, General Transit Feed Specification network
   data, and school enrollment data, along with the geographical data of
   the Greater Montreal Area, were used. The IIOM is a nonlinear model with
   sociodemographic, socioeconomic, and PT supply characteristics, as well
   as work and study spatial location attributes. Analysis of the modeling
   performance by means of several goodness-of-fit measures showed that the
   IIOM was well behaved (i.e., globally it had good prediction
   capabilities) and more accurate than the classical gravity model. On the
   basis of explanatory variables used in the IIOM, the study presents a
   new tool for PT analysts, planners, and policy makers for studying
   potential changes in PT trip patterns, as a result of changes in
   sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteristics, PT supply, and so
   on. Also, this study opens new opportunities for development of more
   accurate PT demand models with new emergent data such as smartcard
   entries.}},

   paper proposes postponed substitution combined with function
   maximization to address this problem. The paper also proposes a
   modification in the error propagation process to enhance the error
   modeling accuracy. An existing word length optimization method is
   reproduced to evaluate the efficiency of this modification. The results

Abstract = {{Distributed Collaborative Editors are interactive systems where several
   and dispersed users edit concurrently shared documents. Generally, these
   systems rely on data replication and use safe coordination protocol
   which ensures data consistency even though the users's updates are
   executed in any order on different copies. Controlling access in such
   systems is a challenging problem, as they need dynamic access changes
   and low latency access to shared documents. In {[}1], a flexible access
   control protocol is proposed; it is based on replicating the shared
   document and its authorization policy at the local memory of each user.
   To deal with latency and dynamic access changes, an optimistic access
   control technique is used where enforcement of authorizations is
   retroactive. However, verifying whether the combination of access
   control and coordination protocols preserves the data consistency is a
   hard task since it requires examining a large number of situations. In
   this paper, we specify this access control protocol in the first-order
   relational logic with Alloy, and we verify that it preserves the
   correctness of the system on which it is deployed in such a way that the
   access control policy is enforced identically at all participating user
   sites and, accordingly, the data consistency remains still maintained.}},

Abstract = {{The magnetic environment provided by a clinical Magnetic Resonance
   Imaging (MRI) scanner can be exploited for implementing a method of
   communication with intelligent microrobots. For untethered sensory
   microrobots having some level of intelligence and operating inside the
   body, the transmission power necessary to communicate information to an
   external computer via known methods is insufficient.
   In this paper, a technique is described where such loss of transmission
   power due to the scaling of these microrobots can be compensated by the
   MRI scanner acting as a more sensitive receiver. We propose a binary
   communication scheme in the form of a directional alteration in the
   current circulating in a miniature coil that could be embedded in the
   microrobot. The direction of the current could be regulated from a
   predetermined sensory threshold input implemented on the microrobot. The
   direction of the current provides information about the level of sensory
   input from a microrobot and it is determined using MR phase encoding
   images. The preliminary results which are presented in this paper
   confirmed the possibility of using this communication method in future
   microrobots.}},

Abstract = {{In Quebec, workers intervening in hazardous zones of machines, equipment
   and processes during maintenance, repairs and unjamming activities have
   to apply lockout procedures. Lockout procedures involve shutting down
   the equipment, isolating it, applying individual locks, releasing
   residual energies and verifying the absence of energies. Lockout has
   mostly been linked to industrial sectors. However, the municipal sector
   also faces challenges when it comes to controlling hazardous energies.
   The objectives of this research are to study serious accidents linked to
   our subject, study the application of lockout in different
   municipalities in Quebec, identify the specificities for the municipal
   sector and propose some means to support the application of lockout. We
   will show that lockout procedures are required in different locations in
   municipalities and that they are currently being implemented in the
   municipal sector in Quebec. Moreover, we propose a model which aims at
   facilitating the implementation of lockout procedures in the municipal

Abstract = {{This work presents the fabrication of polymer based nanocomposites with
   improved conductivity consisting of heterogeneous distribution of
   nanofillers, either multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) or
   surface-treated silver nanowires (SN) in a thermosetting polymer matrix.
   The heterogeneous distribution was achieved through controlling the
   filler-resin interactions during the nanocomposites curing. As the
   nanocomposites were thermally cured, the nanofillers tended to
   self-assemble into a segregated network and form continuous pathways of
   conductive nanofillers. This rearrangement of the nanofillers resulted
   in a biphasic nanocomposite with filler-rich and resin-rich domains, as
   observed under optical microscopy. At a specific filler concentration,
   the achieved biphasic nanocomposites showed an improved electrical
   conductivity compared to the nanocomposites composed of uniformly
   distributed fillers. In particular, a significant improvement (similar
   to 30 folds) of electrical properties was achieved for a 50 mu m-thick
   film of the nanocomposite containing 1 vol.\% non-uniformly distributed
   SN. The work presented here could be used to fabricate lightweight
   highly conductive nanocomposites (at higher filler loadings) for
   aerospace applications such as electromagnetic interference (EMI)
   shielding and lightning strike protection.}},

Abstract = {{Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
   imaging has been shown to identify myocardial fibrosis secondary to
   myocardial infarction at nearly a cellular level. The purpose of this
   study is to assess diffuse myocardial fibrosis in aging hearts using LGE
   CMR imaging and histological staining as a reference. We present a
   quantitative approach to compare the amount of myocardial fibrosis
   between young (6-week-old) and elderly (2-year-old) rats. We hypothesize
   that 3D texture analysis of the high resolution MR images can
   characterize the level of diffuse fibrosis present in the myocardium and
   discriminate between the two age groups. Our results show the elderly
   hearts have an apparent increase of myocardial fibrosis in the
   histological slices stained with picrosirius red, which were
   qualitatively compared to the young group. The CMR quantification also
   shows a significant increase of myocardial fibrosis in the elderly group
   compared to the young rats. Furthermore, receiver operating
   characteristic curve analysis shows texture features derived from the MR
   images can distinguish between the two age groups better than signal
   intensity of the MR images. Our results suggest that texture analysis
   may improve the ability of detecting diffuse myocardial fibrosis in LGE

Abstract = {{Keypoint-based methods are used in visual tracking applications. These
   methods often model the target as a collection of keypoint descriptors.
   Target localization on subsequent frames is thus a complex task that
   involves detecting keypoints, computing descriptors, matching features,
   and checking match consistency to update the reference model adequately
   and avoid tracker drifts. This work aims to boost keypoint tracking
   efficiency while reducing complexity by a coarse-to-fine state
   estimation to track human faces. In this context, we present a novel
   face tracking algorithm combining color distribution and keypoints to
   model the target. Our tracking strategy is based on a color model to
   predict a coarse state where the target search should be performed using
   keypoints. The fine estimation of the target state is then made by
   matching candidate keypoints with those of a reference appearance model
   that evolves during the tracking procedure. Qualitative and quantitative
   evaluations conducted on a number of challenging video clips demonstrate
   the validity of the proposed method and its competitiveness with state
   of the art trackers.}},

Abstract = {{In general, the problem of change detection is studied in color space.
   Most proposed methods aim at dynamically finding the best color
   thresholds to detect moving objects against a background model.
   Background models are often complex to handle noise affecting pixels.
   Because the pixels are considered individually, some changes cannot be
   detected because it involves groups of pixels and some individual pixels
   may have the same appearance as the background. To solve this problem,
   we propose to formulate the problem of background subtraction in feature
   space. Instead of comparing the color of pixels in the current image
   with colors in a background model, features in the current image are
   compared with features in the background model. The use of a feature at
   each pixel position allows accounting for change affecting groups of
   pixels, and at the same time adds robustness to local perturbations.
   With the advent of binary feature descriptors such as BRISK or FREAK, it
   is now possible to use features in various applications at low
   computational cost. We thus propose to perform background subtraction
   with a small binary descriptor that we named Local Binary Similarity
   Patterns (LBSP). We show that this descriptor outperforms color, and
   that a simple background subtractor using LBSP outperforms many
   sophisticated state of the art methods in baseline scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Recent work shows that local binary feature descriptors are effective
   for increasing the efficiency of object recognition, while retaining
   comparable performance to other state of the art descriptors. An
   extension of these approaches to action recognition in videos would
   facilitate huge gains in efficiency, due to the computational advantage
   of computing a bag-of-words representation with the Hamming distance
   rather than the Euclidean distance. We present a new local
   spatiotemporal descriptor for action recognition that encodes both the
   appearance and motion in a scene with a short binary string. The first
   bytes of the descriptor encode the appearance and some implicit motion,
   through an extension of the recently proposed FREAK descriptor. The
   remaining bytes strengthen the motion model by building a binary string
   through local motion patterns. We demonstrate that by exploiting the
   binary makeup of this descriptor, it is possible to greatly reduce the
   running time of action recognition while retaining competitive
   performance with the state of the art.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews the past and current research status of substrate
   integrated waveguide (SIW) antennas and arrays for GHz and THz system
   applications. Special interest is oriented to on-going worldwide efforts
   and development of various multi-dimensional and multi-functional highly
   integrated SlW antenna and array geometries and techniques with focus on
   single-and multi-beam antennas and arrays. They also include various
   emerging stacked multilayer structures and non-stacked
   three-dimensionally expandable LEGO-style design, which present a
   disruptive scheme. In particular, the LEGO-style design is shown to
   enable the development of partial-and full-plane beam-processing
   antennas and arrays. With the SIW scheme, both beam-forming networks and
   antenna array can be integrated with minimum cross-talk and signal
   interference. Transmitting and receiving antennas can fully be
   integrated on the same substrate with maximum isolation. Forward-looking
   thoughts and future outlooks are provided for higher-density GHz and THz
   integration schemes.}},

   comparison of the results obtained inside and outside a mining

   carried out in the 2 GHz to 6 GHz frequency band. The pass loss model is
   extracted for the measurements inside and outside of the underground
   mine. The path loss exponents in both scenarios are found to be around
   2. A simple statistical model is proposed for the delay spread and, in
   both cases, there are no relations between the delay spread and the
   transmitter receiver distance. Aikake information criterion is used as a
   goodness of fit for comparison of different statistical distributions to
   the delay spread of the vehicle inside the mine. The reflective nature
   of the vehicle environment is shown in the power delay profile and with
   the Ricean K-factor.}},

Abstract = {{On one hand, IMS are a research area that has been gaining attention
   from the research community. It aims to provide cellular access to all
   Internet services. It is a control architecture on the top of the IP
   layer whose goal is dependent on the provision of the Quality of Service
   (QoS), integrated services and fair charging scheme throughout standard
   interfaces. On the other hand, VANETs are a new communication paradigm
   that enables the wireless communication between vehicles moving with
   high speeds, as well as the vehicles and the road side equipments found
   along the roads. This opened the door to develop several new
   applications like traffic engineering, traffic management, dissemination
   of emergency information to avoid critical situations, comfort and
   entertainment and other user applications. Moreover, VANETs are
   sub-class of Mobile Ad-hoc Networks; the performance of the
   communication depends on how better the routing takes place in the
   network. This work proposes a presence-based architecture for the
   integration of VANETs with the IMS in the presence of WSNs too. The
   presence of the middleware is used to make an instantaneous awareness of
   the VANETs' changes as well as the IMS format and to select the best
   delivery strategy between the two architectures.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a standard cell low power 4-bit flash analog-to-digital
   converter (ADC) is proposed. The converter utilizes comparators created
   using only logic gates for converting analog input signals to digital
   values. This novel flash architecture consists of several CMOS gates
   with inputs connected to a common input node or to one of the supply
   lines. Depending on the relationship between the input signal and a
   given gate's threshold voltage, the output will either be `0' or `1'.
   The comparator is followed by an encoder to convert the thermometer code
   to binary code. Low power consumption is achieved by switching off the
   unused parallel voltage comparators. The proposed ADC was implemented at
   the transistor level in a 180nm CMOS technology with a 1.8 V supply
   voltage and was simulated using Cadence Spectre simulator. Simulation
   results show that for the same speed, this ADC provides about 70\% power
   reduction compared to a previously proposed design.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a Green's function-based design for deformation
   control of a microbeam described by an Euler-Bernoulli equation with
   in-domain pointwise actuation. The Green's function is first used in
   control design to construct a test function that guarantees the
   solvability of a map between the original nonhomogeneous partial
   differential equation and a target system in a standard boundary control
   form. Then the regularized Green's function is employed in motion
   planning, leading to a computationally traceable implementation of the
   control scheme combined by a single feedback stabilizing loop and
   feedforward controls. The viability and the applicability of the
   proposed approach are demonstrated through numerical simulations of a
   representative microbeam.}},

Abstract = {{Microwave tomography (MT) measurement setups for different
   configurations based on breast compression are compared to classical
   circular measurement setups. Configurations based on compression allow
   measuring the evanescent component of the scattered field and lead to a
   compact measurement setup that allows direct image comparison with a
   standard mammography system. The different configurations are compared
   based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the radiation
   operator for a 2D TM case. This analysis allows determining under which
   conditions the image quality obtained from the reconstructions can be
   enhanced. These findings are confirmed by a series of reconstructions of
   breast phantoms based on synthetic data obtained at a single frequency
   of operation.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetically-biased graphene supports strong Faraday rotation at
   microwave frequencies. Contrary to other gyrotropic media, such as
   ferrites, Faraday rotation in graphene can be fully controlled via an
   electrostatic potential between graphene and a parallel electrode, while
   the static magnetic bias is kept constant. Based on Faraday rotation in
   graphene, the first graphene-based waveguide isolator is presented. An
   analytical model is developed and shown to exhibit excellent agreement
   with experiment. The performance of the isolator, which strongly depends
   on the mobility of graphene, is acceptable with the existing technology
   and is expected to satisfy commercial requirements as the quality of
   grown graphene improves in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Automatic label assignment to graphical objects is an important problem
   in many applications such as cartography, online maps and graph
   drawings. In this paper, we present efficient algorithms for automatic
   label assignment to execution trace items (points or lines) in a trace
   visualization tool. The proposed label assignment algorithms aim to
   maximize the number of labeled items as well as increase the quality of
   assignments. The algorithms take into account both the topological and
   semantic relationships (e. g. level of details, repetitiveness, etc.)
   between the trace items in order to achieve assignments that are both
   quantitative and qualitative. The proposed method also supports
   assigning multiple labels to each trace item. The algorithms have been
   implemented and applied to different input traces. The experimental
   results show that considering the relationships between data items
   increases the labeling success rate and the quality.}},

Abstract = {{The display of a large load of vectorial data in ``real time{''} has
   always been a challenge for software developers. As part of the
   development of CAD tools to manage a wafer-scale integrated circuit, the
   volume of data to handle is substantial. This article focuses on the
   development of a simple and effective display technique to manage
   software representation of Wafer Scale Integrated circuits using
   equipment available in common computers (Desktop multimedia PC).
   Experimental results show a performance improvement by a factor of 254
   compared to software vectorial rendering with an ``ATI radeon 5570{''}
   video card. This paper shows that the proposed display technique
   normally used for graphic intensive 3D displays (video games, 3D cad
   tools) can also benefit other 2D applications.}},

Title = {{A Feasibility Study for Microwave Breast Cancer Detection Using
   Contrast-Agent-Loaded Bacterial Microbots}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{We propose a new approach to microwave breast tumor sensing and
   diagnosis based on the use of biocompatible flagellated magnetotactic
   bacteria (MTB) adapted to operate in human microvasculature. It has been
   verified experimentally by Martel et al. that externally generated
   magnetic gradients could be applied to guide the MTB along preplanned
   routes inside the human body, and a nanoload could be attached to these
   bacterial microbots. Motivated by these useful properties, we suggest
   loading a nanoscale microwave contrast agent such as carbon nanotubes
   (CNTs) or ferroelectric nanoparticles (FNPs) onto the MTB in order to
   modify the dielectric properties of tissues near the agent-loaded
   bacteria. Subsequently, we propose a novel differential microwave
   imaging (DMI) technique to track simultaneously multiple swarms of MTB
   microbots injected into the breast. We also present innovative
   strategies to detect and localize a breast tissue malignancy and
   estimate its size via this DMI-trackable bacterial microrobotic system.
   Finally, we use an anatomically realistic numerical breast phantom as a
   platform to demonstrate the feasibility of this tumor diagnostic method.}},

Abstract = {{Decades of research in the field of high level hardware description now
   result in tools that are able to automatically transform C/C++
   constructs into highly optimized parallel and pipelined architectures.
   Such approaches work fine when the control flow is a priory known since
   the computation results in a large dataflow graph that can be mapped
   into the available operators. Nevertheless, some applications have a
   control flow that is highly dependant on the data. This paper focuses on
   the hardware implementation of such applications and presents a high
   level synthesis methodology applied to a Hardware Description Language
   (HDL) in which assignments correspond to self-synchronized connections
   between predefined data streaming sources and sinks. A data transfer
   occurs over an established connection when both source and sink are
   ready, according to their synchronization interfaces. Founded on a
   high-level communicating FSM programming model, the language allows the
   user to describe and dynamically modify streaming architectures
   exploiting spatial and temporal parallelism. Our compiler attempts to
   maximize the number of transfers at each clock cycle and automatically
   fixes the potential combinatorial loops induced by the dynamic
   connection of dependant sources and sinks. The methodology is applied to
   the synthesis of a pipelined floating point accumulator using the
   Delayed-Buffering (DB) reduction method. The results we obtain are
   similar to state-of-the-art dedicated architectures but require much
   less design time and expertise.}},

Abstract = {{Thanks to their flexibility and their simple installation, Wireless Mesh
   Networks (WMNs) allow a low cost deployment of a network infrastructure.
   They can be used to extend the wired network coverage allowing
   connectivity anytime and anywhere.
   Network stability is a key performance metric in supporting real time
   communication over the network. Because of high bandwidth demand and
   dynamic traffic variation, several paths in WMNs are expected to be
   unstable. High levels of network instability can lead to interferences,
   packet losses and high delays.
   In this paper, we address the stability problem of WMNs; instability in
   these networks is caused mainly by link quality fluctuations and
   frequent route flapping. Indeed, most routing protocols try to optimize
   a routing metric locally or globally without considering network
   stability. First, we present the key factors that may cause network
   instability; then, we propose a new technique, called Local Node
   Stability-based Routing (LNS), using the entropy function (known as a
   measure of the uncertainty and the disorder in a system) to define a
   node stability.
   Simulation results show that the stability can be improved in WMNs using
   LNS compared to other routing schemes namely RLBDR, MIC and ETX.}},

Abstract = {{A zebrafish model has recently been introduced to study various genetic
   mutations that could lead to spinal deformities such as scoliosis.
   However, current imaging techniques make it difficult to perform
   longitudinal studies of this condition in zebrafish, especially in the
   early stages of development. The goal of this project is to determine
   whether optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a viable non-invasive
   method to image zebrafish exhibiting spinal deformities. Images of both
   live and fixed malformed zebrafish (5 to 21 days postfertilization) as
   well as wild-type fish (5 to 29 days postfertilization) were acquired
   non-invasively using a commercial SD-OCT system, with a laser source
   centered at 930nm (Delta lambda=100nm), permitting axial and lateral
   resolutions of 7 and 8 mu m respectively. Using two-dimensional images
   and three-dimensional reconstructions, it was possible to identify the
   malformed notochord as well as deformities in other major organs at
   different stages of formation. Visualization of the notochord was
   facilitated with the development of a segmentation algorithm. OCT images
   were compared to H\&E histological sections and images obtained by
   calcein staining. Because of the possibility of performing longitudinal
   studies on a same fish and reducing image processing time as compared
   with staining techniques and histology, the use of OCT could facilitate
   phenotypic characterization in studying genetic factors leading to
   spinal deformities in zebrafish and could eventually contribute to the
   functional validation of the genetic causes of spinal deformities such
   as scoliosis.}},

   combined with single current mirrors. This analog buffer can support a
   wide range of operating output voltages, from V-DD - 150 mV down to V-SS

   slew-rate, which range from 66 up to 450 V/mu s and a quasi unity gain
   for all programmed slew-rates. This feature allows the user to adjust
   the proposed buffer to fit its needs while limiting noise injection in
   the power supply as well as quiescent current. Moreover, the proposed
   analog buffer supports a -3 dB bandwidth from 74 up to 194 MHz. The low

Abstract = {{The grain growth kinetics of delta-ferrite was investigated in a model
   Fe-Al alloy in which a small volume fraction of austenite particles is
   used to control grain growth. The specimens were heated to different
   temperatures in the two phase (delta-ferrite+austenite) region and held
   for times between 5 min and 288 h followed by water quenching. The
   coarsening kinetics of the austenite particles could be described both
   in terms of bulk (t(1/3)) and grain boundary (t(1/4)) diffusion. The
   growth of the delta-ferrite grains was dominated by the pinning effect
   of the austenite particles. When the particle pinning pressure was much
   larger than the driving force for grain growth, the growth of
   delta-ferrite grains was completely pinned. Under conditions in which
   the particle pinning force and the driving force for grain growth were
   comparable, ferrite grain growth occurred at a rate which is
   proportional to the rate of coarsening of the austenite particles. When
   the particle pinning force is smaller than the driving force, grain
   growth occurs at a rate which is lower than that expected without
   pinning.}},

Abstract = {{A reflective surface with polarization rotation property is proposed in

   frequency responses in the passband have been obtained with oblique

   surface consists of a dual-mode substrate integrated waveguide (SIW)
   cavity resonator with horizontal and vertical slots on the same side. A
   parametric study of its frequency responses has been done with full-wave

Abstract = {{We have developed a new system to generate GHz repetition rate tunable
   pulses in the picosecond regime at any wavelength by using
   self-phase-locked stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS). The
   phase-locked comb at any required wavelength is generated using a single
   length of fiber in a ring cavity, seeded by an amplified single
   frequency CW pump laser. We demonstrate a coherent phase relationship
   between multiple cascaded Stokes waves in the cavity, which directly
   leads to a highly stable pulse regime. This scheme does not require the
   matching of frequency components to the cavity, as the frequency
   components are generated by SBS and not oscillating modes. The coherent
   pulses in the time domain are in the order of similar to 10 ps. The
   nature of the fiber leads to a stable SBS frequency shift, which is
   directly correlated to the repetition frequency and which is in the
   order of tens of GHz. Since the process is governed by SBS, it is
   self-starting and has a linear dependence with temperature (1
   MHz/degrees C), which could be used for fine adjustments. Such a laser
   is therefore suitable for high-speed optical clocks and optical
   communication system, amongst other applications. This system allows the
   ultra-short pulses to be generated at any wavelength by simply tuning
   the wavelength of the seed laser. The pump power allows the pulse width
   to be tuned in steps, by generating additional Stokes orders. The
   repetition rate is altered by the choice of fiber cavity or by the
   choice of the orders of the SBS shifted frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{Improving the appearance of the trunk is an important goal of scoliosis
   surgical treatment, mainly in patients' eyes. Unfortunately, existing
   methods for assessing postoperative trunk appearance are rather
   subjective as they rely on a qualitative evaluation of the trunk shape.
   In this paper, an objective method is proposed to quantify the changes
   in trunk shape after surgery. Using a non-invasive optical system, the
   whole trunk surface is acquired and reconstructed in 3D. Trunk shape is
   described by two functional measurements spanning the trunk length: the
   lateral deviation and the axial rotation. To measure the pre and
   postoperative differences, a correction rate is computed for both
   measurements. On a cohort of 36 scoliosis patients with the same spinal
   curve type who underwent the same surgical approach, surgery achieved a
   very good correction of the lateral trunk deviation (median correction
   of 76\%) and a poor to moderate correction of the back axial rotation
   (median correction of 19\%). These results demonstrate that after
   surgery, patients are still confronted with residual trunk deformity,
   mainly a persisting hump on the back. That can be explained by the fact
   that current scoliosis assessment and treatment planning are based
   solely on radiographic measures of the spinal deformity and do not take
   trunk deformity into consideration. It is believed that with our novel
   quantitative trunk shape descriptor, clinicians and surgeons can now
   objectively assess trunk deformity and postoperative shape and propose
   new treatment strategies that could better address patients' concern
   about their appearance.}},

Abstract = {{A method for the construction of a patient-specific model of a scoliotic
   torso for surgical planning via inter-patient registration is presented.
   Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) of a generic model are registered to
   surface topography (TP) and X-ray data of a test patient. A partial
   model is first obtained via thin-plate spline registration between TP
   and X-ray data of the test patient. The MRIs from the generic model are
   then fit into the test patient using articulated model registration
   between the vertebrae of the generic model's MRIs in prone position and
   the test patient's X-rays in standing position. A non-rigid deformation
   of the soft tissues is performed using a modified thin-plate spline
   constrained to maintain bone rigidity and to fit in the space between
   the vertebrae and the surface of the torso. Results show average Dice
   values of 0.975 +/- 0.012 between the MRIs following inter-patient
   registration and the surface topography of the test patient, which is
   comparable to the average value of 0.976 +/- 0.009 previously obtained
   following intra-patient registration. The results also show a
   significant improvement compared to rigid inter-patient registration.
   Future work includes validating the method on a larger cohort of
   patients and incorporating soft tissue stiffness constraints. The method
   developed can be used to obtain a geometric model of a patient including
   bone structures, soft tissues and the surface of the torso which can be
   incorporated in a surgical simulator in order to better predict the
   outcome of scoliosis surgery, even if MRI data cannot be acquired for
   the patient.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature monitoring and therefore the final treatment zone achieved
   during a cone-beam CT (CBCT) guided ablation can prevent overtreatment
   and undertreatment. A novel method is proposed to detect changes in
   consecutive CBCT images obtained from projection reconstructions during
   an ablation procedure. The possibility is explored of using this method
   to generate thermometry maps from CBCT images, which can be used as an
   input function for ablation treatment planning. This novel method uses a
   baseline and an intermittent CBCT scan, which are routinely acquired to
   confirm the needle position and monitor progress of the ablation.
   Accurate registration is required and assumed in vitro and ex vivo. A
   Wronskian change detector algorithm is applied on the compensated images
   to obtain a difference image between the intermittent and baseline
   scans. Finally, a thermal map created by applying a calibration
   determined experimentally is used to obtain the corresponding
   temperature at each pixel or voxel. We applied Wronskian change detector
   to detect the difference of two CBCT images, which have low signal to
   noise ratio, and calibrate Wronskian change model to temperature data
   using a gel phantom. We tested the temperature mapping with water and
   gel phantoms as well as pig shoulder. The experimental results show this
   method can detect temperature change within 5 degrees C for a voxel size
   of 1mm(3) (within clinical relevancy), and by consequence delineate the
   ablation zone. The preliminary experimental results show that CBCT
   thermometry is possible and promising, but may require pre-processing,
   such as registration for motion compensation between the baseline and
   intermittent scans. Further, quantitative evaluations have to be
   conducted for validation prior to clinical assessment and translation.
   CBCT is a widely available technology that could make thermometry
   clinically practical as an enabling component of iterative ablation
   treatment planning.}},

Title = {{Assisted design of linkage-driven adaptive soft fingers}},
Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL ROBOT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},

Pages = {{337-346}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Adaptive grippers are versatile end effectors that
   mechanically adapt their shapes to the objects they seize, allowing for
   soft and delicate grasps while still allowing for strong contact forces
   if needed and therefore they are well suited for industrial
   applications. The purpose of this paper is to present a
   software-oriented approach to design optimal architectures of
   linkage-driven adaptive (often a.k.a underactuated) fingers with three
   degrees of freedom.
   Design/methodology/approach - The user of the software presented in this
   paper can design planar underactuated fingers following defined
   constraints. The software uses an algorithm able to compute the internal
   and contact forces generated, respectively, in and by the finger, it is
   also capable of automating the design of non-straight links to eliminate
   mechanical interferences, and includes results from a topological
   synthesis to generate all possible architectures. The mechanisms are
   evaluated for many criteria such as the volume of their workspaces,
   stability, force isotropy, stiffness of their grasps, and compactness.
   Findings - This article introduces 11 new designs of underactuated
   fingers for four different usages, and many of these variants are good
   candidates for a physical realization. One of the interesting results of
   this work is the recurrence of S3 variants coupled with torque
   amplifiers or closely resembling designs using many unrelated
   performance criteria.
   Originality/value - This paper is the first, to the best of the authors'
   knowledge, to investigate the systematic design of underactuated fingers
   driven by linkages considering not one but dozens of mechanical
   architectures.}},

Abstract = {{Eumelanin pigments show hydration-dependent conductivity, broad-band
   UV-vis absorption, and chelation of metal ions. Solution-processing of
   synthetic eumelanins opens new possibilities for the characterization of
   eumelanin in thin film form and its integration into bioelectronic
   devices. We investigate the effect of different synthesis routes and
   processing solvents on the growth, the morphology, and the chemical
   composition of eumelanin thin films using atomic force microscopy and
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. We further characterize the films by
   transient electrical current measurements obtained at 50\% to 90\%
   relative humidity, relevant for bioelectronic applications. We show that
   the use of dimethyl sulfoxide is preferable over ammonia solution as
   processing solvent, yielding homogeneous films with surface roughnesses
   below 0.5 nm and a chemical composition in agreement with the eumelanin
   molecular structure. These eumelanin films grow in a quasi
   layer-by-layer mode, each layer being composed of nanoaggregates, 1-2 nm
   high, 10-30 nm large. The transient electrical measurements using a
   planar two-electrode device suggest that there are two contributions to
   the current, electronic and ionic, the latter being increasingly
   dominant at higher hydration, and point to the importance of
   time-dependent electrical characterization of eumelanin films.}},

Abstract = {{Faraday rotation observed in magnetically biased graphene is reviewed.
   For the best quality of CVD grown graphene to date and a magnetic field
   of 1 T a Faraday rotation around 10 degrees is estimated. In contrast to
   other gyrotropic materials such as ferrites where rotation direction can
   only be controlled by the magnetic bias field, the rotation direction in
   graphene can be reversed by reversing an electric bias voltage applied
   between graphene and a gate electrode. The rotation angle is
   proportional to the mobility of graphene, which imposes a practical
   challenge in achieving rotation angles greater than 15 degrees. However,
   even angles as low as 10 degrees are enough to design isolators with
   isolation in the order of 20 dB. Due to the conducting nature of
   graphene at microwave frequencies, such devices are always accompanied
   by moderate loss, which however can be considered acceptable accounting
   advantages of graphene-based devices, such as easy tunability and
   invunerability to demagnetization effects present in ferrite-based
   devices.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to explore whether differences in
   standing and sitting postures of youth with idiopathic scoliosis could
   be detected from quantitative analysis of digital photographs. Standing
   and sitting postures of 50 participants aged 10-20-years-old with
   idiopathic scoliosis (Cobb angle: 15 degrees to 60 degrees) were
   assessed from digital photographs using a posture evaluation software
   program. Based on the XY coordinates of markers, 13 angular and linear
   posture indices were calculated in both positions. Paired t-tests were
   used to compare values of standing and sitting posture indices.
   Significant differences between standing and sitting positions (p <
   0.05) were found for head protraction, shoulder elevation, scapula
   asymmetry, trunk list, scoliosis angle, waist angles, and frontal and
   sagittal plane pelvic tilt. Quantitative analysis of digital photographs
   is a clinically feasible method to measure standing and sitting postures
   among youth with scoliosis and to assist in decisions on therapeutic

Abstract = {{Over the years, many researchers have studied the evolution and
   maintenance of object-oriented source code in order to understand the
   possibly costly erosion of the software. However, many studies thus far
   did not link the evolution of classes to faults. Since (1) some classes
   evolve independently, other classes have to do it together with others
   (co-evolution); and (2) not all classes are meant to last forever, but
   some are meant for experimentation or to try out an idea that was then
   dropped or modified. In this paper, we group classes based on their
   evolution to infer their lifetime models and co-evolution trends. Then,
   we link each group's evolution to faults. We create phylogenetic trees
   showing the evolutionary history of programs and we use such trees to
   facilitate spotting the program code decay. We perform an empirical
   study, on three open-source programs: ArgoUML, JFreechart, and XercesJ,
   to examine the relation between the evolution of object-oriented source
   code at class level and fault-proneness. Our results indicate that (1)
   classes having a specific lifetime model are significantly less
   fault-prone than other classes and (2) faults fixed by maintaining
   co-evolved classes are significantly more frequent than faults fixed
   using not co-evolved classes.}},

Abstract = {{We present ACRE, an Automated aspeCt cREator, to use aspect-oriented
   programming (AOP) to perform memory, invariant and interferences testing
   for software programs written in C++. ACRE allows developers without
   knowledge in AOP to use aspects to test their programs without modifying
   the behavior of their source code. ACRE uses a domain-specific language
   (DSL), which statements testers insert into the source code like
   comments to describe the aspects to be used. The presence of DSL
   statements in the code does not modify the program's compilation and
   behavior. ACRE parses the DSL statements and automatically generates
   appropriate aspects that are then weaved into the source code to
   identify bugs due to memory leaks, incorrect algorithm implementation,
   or interference among threads. Thanks to the use of aspects and ACRE,
   testers can add or remove tests easily. Using an aspect generated by
   ACRE, we find a memory leak in a complex C++ software program, NOMAD,
   used in both industry and research. We also verify a crucial
   mathematical point of the algorithm behind NOMAD and collect data to
   find possible interference bugs, in NOMAD.}},

Abstract = {{Antipatterns are known as recurring, poor design choices; recent and
   past studies indicated that they negatively affect software systems in
   terms of understandability and maintainability, also increasing
   change-and defect-proneness. For this reason, refactoring actions are
   often suggested. In this paper, we investigate a different side-effect
   of antipatterns, which is their effect on testability and on testing
   cost in particular. We consider as (upper bound) indicator of testing
   cost the number of test cases that satisfy the minimal data member usage
   matrix (MaDUM) criterion proposed by Bashir and Goel.
   A study-carried out on four Java programs, Ant 1.8.3, ArgoUML 0.20,
   CheckStyle 4.0, and JFreeChart 1.0.13-supports the evidence that, on the
   one hand, antipatterns unit testing requires, on average, a number of
   test cases substantially higher than unit testing for non-antipattern
   classes. On the other hand, antipattern classes must be carefully tested
   because they are more defect-prone than other classes. Finally, we
   illustrate how specific refactoring actions-applied to classes
   participating in antipatterns-could reduce testing cost.}},

Abstract = {{Recent and past studies have shown that poor source code lexicon
   negatively affects software understandability, maintainability, and,
   overall, quality. Besides a poor usage of lexicon and documentation,
   sometimes a software artifact description is misleading with respect to
   its implementation. Consequently, developers will spend more time and
   effort when understanding these software artifacts, or even make wrong
   assumptions when they use them.
   This paper introduces the definition of software linguistic
   antipatterns, and defines a family of them, i.e., those related to
   inconsistencies (i) between method signatures, documentation, and
   behavior and (ii) between attribute names, types, and comments. Whereas
   ``design{''} antipatterns represent recurring, poor design choices,
   linguistic antipatterns represent recurring, poor naming and commenting
   choices.
   The paper provides a first catalogue of one family of linguistic
   antipatterns, showing real examples of such antipatterns and explaining
   what kind of misunderstanding they can cause. Also, the paper proposes a
   dectector prototype for Java programs called LAPD (Linguistic
   Anti-Pattern Detector), and reports a study investigating the presence
   of linguistic antipatterns in four Java software projects.}},

Abstract = {{Software ecosystems form the heart of modern companies' collaboration
   strategies with end users, open source developers and other companies.
   An ecosystem consists of a core platform and a halo of user
   contributions that provide value to a company or project. In order to
   sustain the level and number of high-quality contributions, it is
   crucial for companies and contributors to understand how ecosystems tend
   to evolve and can be maintained successfully over time.
   As a first step, this paper explores the evolution characteristics of
   the statistical computing project GNU R, which is a successful, end-user
   programming ecosystem. We find that the ecosystem of user-contributed R
   packages has been growing steadily since R's conception, at a
   significantly faster rate than core packages, yet each individual
   package remains stable in size. We also identified differences in the
   way user-contributed and core packages are able to attract an active
   community of users.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic sensors based on GMI devices are the subject of intensive
   research, as they appear promising for magnetometry applications.
   Performances of GMT magnetometers are often limited by the noise of the
   electronic setup. Thus, the present challenge is to increase the GMI
   device sensitivity (expressed in V/T) in order to decrease the
   equivalent magnetic noise of the system. In our previous work, we showed
   that the use of a pick-up coil in an off-diagonal configuration improves
   the magnetic sensor sensitivity and offers a promising approach for
   developing an inexpensive magnetometer with sub-pT/root Hz equivalent
   magnetic noise levels. Ideally, the use of a coil increases the
   sensitivity linearly as a function of the number of turns. However, this
   effect is reduced by the parasitic capacitance of the coil. This affects
   the device sensitivity, noise level and system performance. The
   parasitic capacitance can degrade all of these, but also induces a
   resonance effect, which can help to optimize magnetometer sensitivity,
   and thus, its noise level. We analyze the effects of the parasitic
   capacitance on the system (sensitivity and noise) and propose
   optimization routes. We have obtained sensor sensitivity as high as 700
   fT/root Hz.}},

Abstract = {{Metal matrix composites (MMCs) are new generation engineering materials
   that possess superior physical and mechanical properties compared to
   non-reinforced alloys. However, the presence of abrasive ceramic
   reinforcements in the ductile matrix causes severe tool wear and
   premature tool failure. Flank wear was found to be the dominant wear
   mode while the main wear mechanism was abrasion. Analysis of the cutting
   tools using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has shown that both
   two-body and three-body abrasion are operational during machining of
   MMCs. In this paper, a methodology for predicting the tool flank wear
   progression during bar turning of MMCs is presented. In the proposed
   model, the wear volume due to two-body and three-body abrasion
   mechanisms was formulated. In addition, the flank wear rate was
   quantified by considering the tool geometry in three dimensional (3D)
   turning. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the
   contribution of two-body and three-body abrasion towards the tool wear
   volume during cutting MMCs.}},

Abstract = {{A power law degree distribution is displayed in many complex networks.
   However, in most real social and economic networks, deviation from
   power-law behavior is observed. Such networks also have giant hubs far
   from the tail of the power law distribution. We propose a model based on
   information `transparency (i.e. how much information is visible to
   others), which can explain the power structure in societies with
   non-transparency in information delivery. The emergence of very high
   degree nodes is explained as a direct result of censorship. Based on
   these assumptions, we define four distinct transparency regions:
   perfectly non-transparent, low transparent, perfectly transparent
   regions and regions where information is exaggerated. We observe the
   emergence of some very high degree nodes in low transparency networks.
   We show that the low transparency networks are more vulnerable to attack
   and the controllability of low transparent networks is more difficult
   than for the others. Also, the low transparency networks have a smaller
   mean path length and higher clustering coefficients than the other
   regions.}},

Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{77-87}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a method to obtain
   hybrid rapid tools with elementary component assembly.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors' method proposes a functional
   representational model, starting with the product features, analyzed
   from three points of view: a feasibility analysis; a manufacturing
   analysis; and an assembly and synthesis analysis. This method, based on
   CAD STEP AP-224 data, makes it possible to obtain an exhaustive list of
   solutions for the module. The work is illustrated with an industrial
   example. To construct the Assembly Identity Card (AIC) and test the
   various parameters that influence the quality of the injected parts, a
   hybrid injection mold has been produced. The methodology associated with
   the use of this AIC uses a ``representation graph{''}, which makes it
   possible to propose a set of valid solutions for assembling the various
   tooling modules. This method is validated by industrial example.
   Findings - The product part is decomposed into a multi-component
   prototype (MCP), instead of being made as a single part, which optimizes
   the manufacturing process and enables greater reactivity during the
   development of the product.
   Research limitations/implications - The final goal is to propose a
   software assistant used in association with CAD system during the design
   of hybrid rapid tooling. An important work concerning the features
   recognition must be implemented. The assembly of the different parts of
   the hybrid rapid tooling must be considered and optimized.
   Practical implications - This method allows the selection of the best
   process technologies from manufacturing tools.
   Originality/value - The analysis of manufacturing hybrid rapid tooling
   has not been studied previously.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the design of a low-power biostimulator, capable
   of generating stimulus pulses with arbitrary wave shapes and
   programmable amplitude and timing. Designed based on a modular
   architecture with programmable stimulation details, this system can be

   requirements for biomedical stimulation systems such as small physical
   size, serial data communication with external setup, and low-power
   consumption. It also performs basic functions such as generating
   bi-phasic pulses, single/train pulses, and residual charge cancellation.
   Clock gating, operation with external timing, and shared resources are
   used among the main techniques to significantly reduce the power
   consumption of the system. To wirelessly interface with the external
   setup, a BPSK demodulator and clock recovery circuit is used which
   exhibit 100\% data-rate-to-carrier-frequency ratio and consumes as low
   as 120 mu W at 2.5Mbps. The system was designed and simulated in a

Title = {{Computer-assisted planning and navigation improves cutting accuracy
   during simulated bone tumor surgery of the pelvis}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER AIDED SURGERY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{19-26}},
Abstract = {{Background: Resection of bone tumors within the pelvis requires good
   cutting accuracy to achieve satisfactory safe margins. Manually
   controlled bone cutting can result in serious errors, especially due to
   the complex three-dimensional geometry, limited visibility, and
   restricted working space of the pelvic bone. This experimental study
   investigated cutting accuracy during navigated and non-navigated
   simulated bone tumor cutting in the pelvis.
   Methods: A periacetabular tumor resection was simulated using a pelvic
   bone model. Twenty-three operators (10 senior and 13 junior surgeons)
   were asked to perform the tumor cutting, initially according to a
   freehand procedure and later with the aid of a navigation system. Before
   cutting, each operator used preoperative planning software to define
   four target planes around the tumor with a 10-mm desired safe margin.
   After cutting, the location and flatness of the cut planes were
   measured, as well as the achieved surgical margins and the time required
   for each cutting procedure.
   Results: The location of the cut planes with respect to the target
   planes was significantly improved by using the navigated cutting
   procedure, averaging 2.8 mm as compared to 11.2 mm for the freehand
   cutting procedure (p < 0.001). There was no intralesional tumor cutting
   when using the navigation system. The maximum difference between the
   achieved margins and the 10-mm desired safe margin was 6.5 mm with the
   navigated cutting process (compared to 13 mm with the freehand cutting
   process).
   Conclusions: Cutting accuracy during simulated bone cuts of the pelvis
   can be significantly improved by using a freehand process assisted by a
   navigation system. When fully validated with complementary in vivo
   studies, the planning and navigation-guided technologies that have been
   developed for the present study may improve bone cutting accuracy during
   pelvic tumor resection by providing clinically acceptable margins.}},

Abstract = {{To circumvent the existing shortcoming of optimisation algorithms in
   trunk biomechanical models, both agonist and antagonist trunk muscle
   stresses to different powers are introduced in a novel objective
   function to evaluate the role of abdominal muscles in trunk stability
   and spine compression. This coupled objective function is introduced in
   our kinematics-driven finite element model to estimate muscle forces and
   to identify the role of abdominal muscles in upright standing while
   lifting symmetrically a weight at different heights. Predictive
   equations for the compression and buckling forces are developed. Results
   are also compared with the conventional objective function that neglects
   abdominal muscle forces. An overall optimal solution involving smaller
   spinal compression but higher trunk stability is automatically attained
   when choosing muscle stress powers at and around 3. Results highlight
   the internal oblique muscle as the most efficient abdominal muscle
   during the tasks investigated. The estimated relative forces in
   abdominal muscles are found to be in good agreement with the respective
   ratios of recorded electromyography activities.}},

Title = {{Simulation Strategy for the Evaluation of Neutronic Properties of a
   Canadian SCWR Fuel Channel}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF NUCLEAR INSTALLATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{The Canadian Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor (SCWR) is a vertical
   pressure tube reactor cooled with supercritical light water and
   moderated with heavy water. For normal operation, the local conditions
   of the coolant (density and temperature) and fuel (temperature) vary
   substantially along the channel. This means that to simulate adequately
   the behavior of the core under operating conditions or for anticipated
   accident scenario, expensive 3D transport calculations for a complete
   fuel channel are required. Here, we propose a simulation strategy that
   takes into account axial variations of the local conditions and avoids
   3D transport calculations. This strategy consists in replacing the 3D
   simulation by a series of isolated 2D calculations followed by a single
   1D simulation. It is shown that this strategy is efficient because the
   axial coupling along the fuel channel is relatively weak. In addition,
   the neutronic properties of a channel with axial reflector can be
   modeled using a simplified 3D transport calculation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the behavior of two 8-story cantilevered RC
   shear walls rehabilitated using carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP)
   composite sheets when subjected to base excitations from a shake table.
   The two original reduced size walls (1:0.429) were tested on the shake
   table of Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal to investigate the effect of
   higher modes of vibration on the behavior of multistory RC walls. The
   walls were subjected to several levels of ground motion excitation that
   matches the design spectrum of Montreal city in Quebec, Canada. The
   original walls showed significant inelastic deformations at the
   6th-story level in addition to those at the base plastic hinge. After
   the shake table tests on each of the two original walls, the damaged
   walls were rehabilitated and resubjected to the same levels of the
   ground motion excitations. This paper focuses on the FRP-rehabilitation
   of the original walls. The rehabilitation scheme for the two walls aimed
   to increase the flexural and shear capacities of the wall at the
   6th-story panel because of the observed increase in demand at that
   level, whereas the base panel was confined using CFRP sheets to increase
   the ductility capacity without increasing strength. The rehabilitated
   walls showed satisfactory performance with improved flexural strength at
   the 6th-story panel. The rehabilitation scheme resulted in a reduced
   wall rotation and lower strain values of the flexural steel rebars at
   the 6th-story panel. The shear demands and bending moments on the
   FRP-rehabilitated walls were higher than those of the original ones.

Abstract = {{Our objective was to demonstrate that ALS patients have sensory pathway
   involvement and that local cord atrophy reflects segmental lower motor
   neuron involvement. Twenty-nine ALS patients with spinal onset and
   twenty-one healthy controls were recruited. Diffusion tensor imaging
   (DTI), magnetization transfer and atrophy index were measured in the
   spinal cord, complemented with transcranial magnetic stimulations.
   Metrics were quantified within the lateral corticospinal and the dorsal
   segments of the cervical cord. Significant differences were detected
   between patients and controls for DTI and magnetization transfer metrics
   in the lateral and dorsal segments of the spinal cord. Fractional
   anisotropy correlated with ALSFRS-R (p = 0.04) and motor threshold (p =
   0.02). Stepwise linear regression detected local spinal cord atrophy
   associated with weakness in the corresponding muscle territory, i.e. C4
   level for deltoid and C7 level for hand muscles. In conclusion,
   impairment of spinal sensory pathways was detected at an early stage of
   the disease. Our data also demonstrate an association between muscle
   deficits and local spinal cord atrophy, suggesting that atrophy is a
   sensitive biomarker for lower motor neurons degeneration.}},

   using a microfluidics-based multiplex platform}},
Journal = {{BIOMICROFLUIDICS}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{The use of biomarkers to infer drug response in patients is being
   actively pursued, yet significant challenges with this approach,
   including the complicated interconnection of pathways, have limited its
   application. Direct empirical testing of tumor sensitivity would
   arguably provide a more reliable predictive value, although it has
   garnered little attention largely due to the technical difficulties
   associated with this approach. We hypothesize that the application of
   recently developed microtechnologies, coupled to more complex
   3-dimensional cell cultures, could provide a model to address some of
   these issues. As a proof of concept, we developed a microfluidic device
   where spheroids of the serous epithelial ovarian cancer cell line
   TOV112D are entrapped and assayed for their chemoresponse to carboplatin
   and paclitaxel, two therapeutic agents routinely used for the treatment
   of ovarian cancer. In order to index the chemoresponse, we analyzed the
   spatiotemporal evolution of the mortality fraction, as judged by vital
   dyes and confocal microscopy, within spheroids subjected to different
   drug concentrations and treatment durations inside the microfluidic
   device. To reflect microenvironment effects, we tested the effect of
   exogenous extracellular matrix and serum supplementation during spheroid
   formation on their chemotherapeutic response. Spheroids displayed
   augmented chemoresistance in comparison to monolayer culturing. This
   resistance was further increased by the simultaneous presence of both
   extracellular matrix and high serum concentration during spheroid
   formation. Following exposure to chemotherapeutics, cell death profiles
   were not uniform throughout the spheroid. The highest cell death
   fraction was found at the center of the spheroid and the lowest at the
   periphery. Collectively, the results demonstrate the validity of the
   approach, and provide the basis for further investigation of
   chemotherapeutic responses in ovarian cancer using microfluidics
   technology. In the future, such microdevices could provide the framework
   to assay drug sensitivity in a timeframe suitable for clinical decision
   making. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

Journal = {{WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{67}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{789-796}},
Abstract = {{Activated sludge models have assumed that a portion of organic solids in
   municipal wastewater influent is unbiodegradable. Also, it is assumed
   that solids from biomass decay cannot be degraded further. The paper
   evaluates these assumptions based on data from systems operating at
   higher than typical sludge retention times (SRTs), including membrane
   bioreactor systems with total solids retention (no intentional sludge
   wastage). Data from over 30 references and with SRTs of up to 400 d were
   analysed. A modified model that considers the possible degradation of
   the two components is proposed. First order degradation rates of
   approximately 0.007 d(-1) for both components appear to improve sludge
   production estimates. Factors possibly influencing these degradation
   rates such as wastewater characteristics and bioavailability are
   discussed.}},

Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON EMBEDDED COMPUTING SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1, SI}},

Abstract = {{The main problem of verification techniques based on exploration of
   (reachable) state space is the state explosion problem. In timed models,
   abstract states reached by different interleavings of the same set of
   transitions are, in general, different and their union is not
   necessarily an abstract state. To attenuate this state explosion, it
   would be interesting to reduce the redundancy caused by the interleaving
   semantics by agglomerating all these abstract states whenever their
   union is an abstract state.
   This article considers the time Petri net model and establishes some
   sufficient conditions that ensure that this union is an abstract state.
   In addition, it proposes a procedure to compute this union without
   computing beforehand intermediate abstract states. Finally, it shows how
   to use this result to improve the reachability analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Camera calibration is a necessary step in all video analysis
   applications to recover the real-world positions of concerned road
   users. Camera calibration can be performed based on feature
   correspondences between the real-world space and image space. In urban
   traffic scenes, the field of view may be too limited or video camera may
   not be accessible to allow reliable calibration based on vanishing
   points. A review of the current methods for camera calibration reveals
   little attention to these practical challenges that arise when studying
   urban intersections to support applications in traffic engineering. This
   study presents the development details of a robust camera calibration
   approach based on integrating a collection of geometric information
   found in urban traffic scenes in a consistent optimization framework.
   The developed approach was tested on six datasets obtained from urban
   intersections in British Columbia, California, and Kentucky. The results
   clearly demonstrated the robustness of the proposed approach.}},

Title = {{An experimental method to evaluate global pumping in a mixing system:
   Application to the Maxblend (TM) for Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{214}},
Pages = {{394-406}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{This work introduces an experimental method to determine the global
   pumping capacity of an impeller in a transparent vessel using a
   decolorization method. Contrary to commonly used experimental methods
   such as Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Laser Doppler Velocimetry
   (LDV), this new inexpensive and easy-to-use method can be employed to
   quickly fill the lack of data in the literature about the impact of
   impeller geometry on the pumping efficiency. The new method was first
   applied to three well-known mixing systems and a Newtonian fluid to
   assess its reliability and accuracy: a six-blade Rushton turbine (RT), a
   pitched blade turbine (PBT) with four 45 degrees blades, and a
   three-blade hydrofoil propeller (HP). It was then applied to evaluate
   the global pumping capacity of the Maxblend (TM) impeller in the case of
   Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. The results obtained show that, for
   the Newtonian fluid, the Maxblend (TM) impeller performs better than the
   other three impellers in the transitional regime, and it has a similar
   pumping capacity than that of the PBT and the RT in the complete
   turbulent regime. In this case, it was also noticed that the HP is
   outperformed by the other tested impellers over the entire range of
   Reynolds numbers. Moreover, it was observed that the extreme
   shear-thinning behavior of the non-Newtonian fluid used does not
   significantly affect the pumping generated by the Maxblend (TM) impeller
   in the transitional regime, that is for Reynolds number larger than 80.
   A global flow number, normalized by the power draw, is also introduced.
   Based on this criterion, the HP is shown to perform the best in the
   fully turbulent regime. Mixing times evaluated by means of the
   decolorization method also reveal that the Maxblend (TM) impeller is the
   most efficient for all regimes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Finite-element models are a powerful and widely used tool for evaluating
   the ac losses of HTS tapes and wires as well as of assemblies such as
   cables and coils. The H-formulation, which uses the magnetic field
   components as state variables, has proved to be an efficient
   implementation to solve 2-D problems, involving infinitely long or
   axially-symmetric geometries; an excellent agreement with experimental
   data has been found in many cases. However, the simulation of certain
   applications requires a full 3-D model. In this paper we report on the
   development of a 3-D model based on the H-formulation. We describe the
   implementation of Maxwell equations, the imposition of current
   constraints and we discuss the issues related to meshing 3-D volumes.
   The model is validated by comparing the results with those obtained with
   2-D models in cases that can be investigated in 2-D; then, it is used to
   simulate cases that can be handled only in 3-D. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{New framework for standardized notation in wastewater treatment
   modelling}},
Booktitle = {{GUIDELINES FOR USING ACTIVATED SLUDGE MODELS}},
Series = {{Scientific and Technical Report Series}},
Year = {{2013}},

Pages = {{189-209}},
Abstract = {{Many unit process models are available in the field of wastewater
   treatment. All of these models use their own notation, causing problems
   for documentation, implementation and connection of different models
   (using different sets of state variables). The main goal of this paper
   is to propose a new notational framework which allows unique and
   systematic naming of state variables and parameters of biokinetic models
   in the wastewater treatment field. The symbols are based on one main
   letter that gives a general description of the state variable or
   parameter and several subscript levels that provide greater
   specification. Only those levels that make the name unique within the
   model context are needed in creating the symbol. The paper describes
   specific problems encountered with the currently used notation, presents
   the proposed framework and provides additional practical examples. The
   overall result is a framework that can be used in whole plant modelling,
   which consists of different fields such as activated sludge, anaerobic
   digestion, sidestream treatment, membrane bioreactors, metabolic
   approaches, fate of micropollutants and biofilm processes. The main
   objective of this consensus building paper is to establish a consistent
   set of rules that can be applied to existing and most importantly,
   future models. Applying the proposed notation should make it easier for
   everyone active in the wastewater treatment field to read, write and

Abstract = {{The quality of simulation results can be significantly affected by
   errors in the published model (typing, inconsistencies, gaps or
   conceptual errors) and/or in the underlying numerical model description.
   Seven of the most commonly used activated sludge models have been
   investigated to point out the typing errors, inconsistencies and gaps in
   the model publications: (1) ASM1 (Henze et al. 1987; republished in
   Henze et al. 2000a); (2) ASM2d (Henze et al. 1999; republished in Henze
   et al. 2000b); (3) ASM3 (Gujer et al. 1999; corrected version published
   in Gujer et al. 2000); (4) ASM3 + BioP (Rieger et al. 2001); (5) ASM2d +
   TUD (Meijer, 2004); (6) New General (Barker \& Dold, 1997); (7) UCTPHO+
   (Hu et al. 2007).
   A systematic approach to verify models by tracking typing errors and
   inconsistencies in model development and software implementation is
   proposed. Then, stoichiometry and kinetic rate expressions are checked
   for each model and the errors found are reported in detail. An attached
   spreadsheet provides corrected matrices with the calculations of all
   stoichiometric coefficients for the discussed biokinetic models and
   gives an example of proper continuity checks.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims at synthesizing experiences in the practical application
   of ASM type models. The information is made easily accessible to model
   users by creating a database of modelling projects. This database
   includes answers to a questionnaire that was sent out to model users in
   2008 to provide inputs for a Scientific and Technical Report of the IWA
   Task Group on Good Modelling Practice - Guidelines for use of activated
   sludge models, and a literature review on published modelling projects.
   The database is analysed to determine which biokinetic model parameters
   are usually changed by modellers, in which ranges, and what values are
   typically used for seven selected activated sludge models. These results
   should help model users in the calibration step, by providing typical
   parameter values as a starting point and ranges as a guide. However, the
   proposed values should be used with great care since they are the result
   of averaging practical experience and not taking into account specific
   parameter correlations.}},

Abstract = {{Diffuse fluorescence tomography requires high contrast-to-background
   ratios to accurately reconstruct inclusions of interest. This is a
   problem when imaging the uptake of fluorescently labeled molecularly
   targeted tracers in tissue, which can result in high levels of
   heterogeneously distributed background uptake. We present a dual-tracer
   background subtraction approach, wherein signal from the uptake of an
   untargeted tracer is subtracted from targeted tracer signal prior to
   image reconstruction, resulting in maps of targeted tracer binding. The
   approach is demonstrated in simulations, a phantom study, and in a mouse
   glioma imaging study, demonstrating substantial improvement over
   conventional and homogenous background subtraction image reconstruction
   approaches. (c) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a Creative Commons

Abstract = {{Bioengineering approaches have been intensively applied to create small
   diameter vascular grafts using artificial materials. However, a fully
   successful, high performing and anti-thrombogenic structure has not been
   achieved yet. In this study, we present the first step of a process
   aiming at biofunctionalizing previously designed compliant polyethylene
   terephthalate (PET) scaffolds (Moreno et al., 2011). The main challenge
   of such a surface modification is to prevent the bulk polymer from any
   damage, so that it preserves the mechanical properties that the
   structures have been designed for. In that endeavor, an aminated
   long-chain polymer (polyvinylamine, PVAm) was used as an aminolysis
   reagent to get amine (-NH2) moieties only on the very surface of PET.
   Different reaction conditions were assayed, leading to a large range of
   amino group densities associated with slight variations of the planar
   tensile properties. These results were in stark contrast with those
   generated with a common small diamine substrate (ethylenediamine, EtDA),
   as the latter yielded a strong degradation of the mechanical properties
   for comparable amine densities. Tubular mechanical assays were then
   carried out on PVAm-functionalized PET scaffolds. The latter showed a
   compliance match with arteries under the chosen reaction conditions, as
   initially observed for pristine PET tubular scaffolds.}},

   (OTFT) configuration, varies over more than one order of magnitude
   depending upon the dielectric layer used. Atomic force microscopy and
   synchrotron grazing incidence X-ray diffraction measurements, analyzed
   with the extended Rietveld method, were used to investigate the
   influence of film connectivity, crystalline phase, polymorphism, and
   texture on charge transport. The role of the surface polarity and the
   processing conditions of the gate dielectric layer are also discussed.
   Based on our results, we propose guidelines for the selection of a gate
   dielectric material favorable for charge transport in tetracene films.}},

Abstract = {{A high concentration powdered activated carbon (PAC) membrane bioreactor
   (MBR) was fed by clarified-ozonated surface water. As a control, a MBR
   without PAC was run in parallel. Water quality was also compared with a
   full-scale biological activated carbon (BAC) filter. Biological PAC
   inside the MBR caused a higher fouling rate as compared to the MBR
   without PAC, although it was still possible to maintain operation for
   about 3 months at 25 L m(-2) h(-1) before a chemical cleaning was
   needed. The fouling rate inside the MBR with PAC increased as the PAC
   age increased from 0 to 60 d. Full nitrification was achieved in the
   PAC-MBR down to 7 degrees C. Preozonation had no significant impact on
   dissolved organic carbon removal. Although the PAC-MBR globally provided
   superior removal of natural organic matter, haloacetic acid precursors
   and UV absorption at 254 nm (UVA254), its removal of trihalomethane
   (THM) precursors was inferior compared to the BAC filter. This effect
   was shown to be caused by the accumulation of suspended solids inside
   the bioreactor.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate measurement of snow water equivalent (SWE) is an important
   factor in managing water resources for hydroelectric power generation.
   SWE over a catchment area may be estimated via kriging on measures
   obtained by snow monitoring devices positioned at strategic locations.
   The question studied in this paper is how to find the device locations
   that minimize the kriging interpolation error of the SWE. This is done
   first by formulating a simulator blackbox that takes a set of locations
   as inputs and returns the interpolation error, and then to minimize this
   error using the mesh adaptive direct search (MADS) algorithm designed
   for blackbox optimization. The fact that the optimization variables
   represent planar coordinates is used to devise algorithmic strategies
   that dynamically group subsets of variables. The methodology is applied
   to three water-resource systems in the province of Quebec on the
   blackbox simulator and on a surrogate with various grouping strategies.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents an exploratory study investigating the possibility
   of predicting the time occurrence of a motor event related potential
   (ERP) from a kinematic analysis of human movements. Although the
   response-locked motor potential may link the ERP components to the
   recorded response, to our knowledge no previous attempt has been made to
   predict a priori (i.e. before any contact with the
   electroencephalographic data) the time occurrence of an ERP component
   based only on the modeling of an overt response. The proposed analysis
   relies on the delta-lognormal modeling of velocity, as proposed by the
   kinematic theory of rapid human movement used in several studies of
   motor control. Although some methodological aspects of this technique
   still need to be fine-tuned, the initial results showed that the
   model-based kinematic analysis allowed the prediction of the time
   occurrence of a motor command ERP in most participants in the
   experiment. The average map of the motor command ERPs showed that this
   signal was stronger in electrodes close to the contra-lateral motor area
   (Fz, FCz, FC1, and FC3). These results seem to support the claims made
   by the kinematic theory that a motor command is emitted at time t0, the
   time reference parameter of the model. This article proposes a new time
   marker directly associated with a cerebral event (i.e. the emission of a
   motor command) that can be used for the development of new data analysis
   methodologies and for the elaboration of new experimental protocols
   based on ERP.}},

Abstract = {{A concept of simultaneous electric (E) and magnetic (H) 2-D tuning is
   presented, demonstrated, and applied for the first time through the
   theoretical and experimental studies of parameter-agile substrated
   integrated waveguide (SIW) devices. First of all, a two-dimensionally
   tuned SIW cavity is introduced as a building block. Considering only
   electric tuning with varactor diodes, no more than 1.3\% of total tuning
   range is accomplished, while for simultaneous electric and magnetic
   tuning, it is extended to 7.9\% with an unloaded Q factor of better than
   130. Using 0.05-0.1-pF surface mount capacitors, a total tuning range of
   as much as 20\% is experimentally achieved at 12 GHz. Another
   characteristic of significant interest is that the proposed 2-D tuning
   not only allows changing frequency, but also simultaneously optimizing
   other key parameters such as the return loss or unloaded Q factor.
   Second, the dual-tuned SIW cavity resonator is further accommodated to
   demonstrate parameter agile two-dimensionally tuned bandpass filter at
   12 GHz. The proposed concept of 2-D tuning theoretically and
   experimentally demonstrates a simultaneous frequency and bandwidth
   tuning of bandpass filter. This filter can perform both
   frequency-tunable constant bandwidth, and constant-frequency
   variable-bandwidth operations. Third, a cavity backed slot antenna using
   the proposed dual tuning is demonstrated. The tuning not only achieves a
   higher frequency range, but the antenna return loss is optimized to
   improve the overall efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Biological sequestration can increase the carbon stocks of
   non-atmospheric reservoirs (e.g. land and land-based products). Since
   this contained carbon is sequestered from, and retained outside, the
   atmosphere for a period of time, the concentration of CO2 in the
   atmosphere is temporarily reduced and some radiative forcing is avoided.
   Carbon removal from the atmosphere and storage in the biosphere or
   anthroposphere, therefore, has the potential to mitigate climate change,
   even if the carbon storage and associated benefits might be temporary.
   Life cycle assessment (LCA) and carbon footprinting (CF) are
   increasingly popular tools for the environmental assessment of products,
   that take into account their entire life cycle. There have been
   significant efforts to develop robust methods to account for the
   benefits, if any, of sequestration and temporary storage and release of
   biogenic carbon. However, there is still no overall consensus on the
   most appropriate ways of considering and quantifying it.
   This paper reviews and discusses six available methods for accounting
   for the potential climate impacts of carbon sequestration and temporary
   storage or release of biogenic carbon in LCA and CF. Several viewpoints
   and approaches are presented in a structured manner to help
   decision-makers in their selection of an option from competing
   approaches for dealing with timing issues, including delayed emissions
   of fossil carbon.
   Key issues identified are that the benefits of temporary carbon removals
   depend on the time horizon adopted when assessing climate change impacts
   and are therefore not purely science-based but include value judgments.
   We therefore did not recommend a preferred option out of the six
   alternatives presented here.
   Further work is needed to combine aspects of scientific and
   socio-economic understanding with value judgements and ethical
   considerations.}},

Abstract = {{Development of mechatronic products is traditionally carried out by
   several design experts from different design domains. Performing
   development of mechatronic products is thus greatly challenging. In
   order to tackle this, the critical challenges in mechatronics have to be
   well understood and well supported through applicable methods and tools.
   This paper aims at identifying the major challenges, by conducting a
   systematic and thorough survey of the most relevant research work in
   mechatronic design. Solutions proposed in literature are assessed and
   illustrated through a case study in order to investigate if the
   challenges can be handled appropriately by the methods, tools, and
   mindsets suggested by the mechatronic community. Using a real-world
   mechatronics case, the paper identifies the areas where further research
   is required, by showing a clear connection between the actual problems
   faced during the design task and the nature of the solutions currently
   available. From the results obtained from this research, one can
   conclude that although various attempts have been developed to support
   conceptual design of mechatronics, these attempts are still not
   sufficient to help in assessing the consequences of selecting between
   alternative conceptual solutions across multiple domains. We believe
   that a common language is essential in developing mechatronics, and
   should be evaluated based on: its capability to represent the desired
   views effectively, its potential to be understood by engineers from the
   various domains, and its effect on the efficiency of the development
   process. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4007929]}},

Abstract = {{Gold nanoparticles embedded in a silica matrix were irradiated with 2 to
   40 MeV Cu or Si ions at fluences ranging from 1x10(13) to 4x10(15)
   ions/cm(2), and their deformation from spheres to prolate ellipsoids
   with major axis parallel to the ion beam was studied using P and S
   polarized light. For fixed ion energy, the longitudinal surface plasmon
   resonance (SPR) at 520 nmis red-shifted with an increase of the ion
   fluence up to a certain value where it reaches a plateau indicating that
   a maximum aspect ratio is obtained. This saturation in the wavelength
   shift was found to depend on the ion energy and reaches a maximum of 40
   nm. The SPR shift was also used to measure the electronic stopping power
   dependent deformation rate and to deduce the electronic stopping power
   threshold of (1.9 +/- 1.3) keV/nm required for shape transformation of
   the embedded gold nanoparticles. Ion track diameters of 0.18 to 1.4 nm
   were inferred from the fluence dependence of the SPR shift. Analysis by
   transmission electron microscopy shows that large (d > 10 nm) particles
   are more elongated than smaller ones. Our data are consistent with a
   mechanism of gold nanoparticle elongation requiring both the silica
   matrix and the nanoparticles to melt following the passage of the swift
   heavy ion and with elongation being due to the relief of stress in the
   gold nanoparticle which had built up as a consequence of the deformation
   of the surrounding silica matrix. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A novel approach for the analysis of the cyanobacterial toxin,
   anatoxin-a (ANA-a), in an environmentally relevant matrix, using laser
   diode thermal desorption-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-tandem
   mass spectrometry (LDTD-APCI-MS/MS) is presented. The ultra-fast
   analysis time (15 s/sample) provided by the LDTD-APCI interface is
   strengthened by its ability to remove interference from phenylalanine
   (PHE), an isobaric interference in ANA-a analysis by MS/MS. Thus the
   LDTD-APCI interface avoids the time consuming steps of derivatization,
   chromatographic separation or solid-phase extraction prior to analysis.
   Method development and instrumental parameter optimizations were focused
   toward signal enhancement of ANA-a, and signal removal of a PHE
   interference as high as 500 mu g/L. External calibration in a complex
   matrix gave detection and quantification limit values of 1 and 3 mu g/L
   respectively, as well as good linearity (R-2 > 0.999) over nearly two
   orders of magnitude. Internal calibration with clomiphene (CLO) is
   possible and method performance was similar to that obtained by external
   calibration. This work demonstrated the utility of the LDTD-APCI source
   for ultra-fast detection and quantification of ANA-a in environmental
   aqueous matrices, and confirmed its ability to suppress the interference
   of PHE without sample preparation or chromatographic separation. (c)

Abstract = {{Chitosan is a biocompatible polysaccharide composed of glucosamine and
   N-acetylglucosamine. The polymer has a unique behavior of fluctuating
   between soluble chains at pH 6 and insoluble microparticles at pH 7. The
   purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that chitosan
   structure, solubility state, and serum influence the rate of cell
   uptake. Chitosans with 80\% and 95\% degree of deacetylation (medium and
   low viscosity) were tagged with rhodamine and analyzed for particle
   size, media solubility, and uptake by HEK293 epithelial cells using live
   confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. In media pH 7.4 with or without
   10\% serum, chitosans fully precipitated into 0.5 to 1.4 mu m diameter
   microparticles with a slight negative charge. During 24 h of culture in
   serum-free medium, chitosan particles remained extracellular. In
   cultures with serum, particles were taken up into intracellular vesicles
   in a serum dose-dependent manner. Opsonization of chitosan with serum,
   or replacement of serum by epidermal growth factor (EGF) failed to
   mediate serum-free chitosan particle uptake. Serum stimulated cells to
   acidify the media, partly by lactate generation. Media acidified to pH
   6.5 by 7 mM lactate maintained 50\% of chitosan in the soluble fraction,
   and led to minor uniform serum-free uptake in small vesicles.
   Conclusion: Media acidification mediates minor in vitro uptake of
   non-biofouled soluble chitosan chains, while serum-biofouled insoluble
   chitosan microparticles require sustained serum exposure to generate
   energy required for macropinocytosis.}},

Title = {{A Versatile Star PEG Grafting Method for the Generation of Nonfouling
   and Nonthrombogenic Surfaces}},
Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{Polyethylene glycol (PEG) grafting has a great potential to create
   nonfouling and nonthrombogenic surfaces, but present techniques lack
   versatility and stability. The present work aimed to develop a versatile
   PEG grafting method applicable to most biomaterial surfaces, by taking
   advantage of novel primary amine-rich plasma-polymerized coatings.
   Star-shaped PEG covalent binding was studied using static contact angle,
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and quartz crystal microbalance
   with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). Fluorescence and QCM-D both
   confirmed strong reduction of protein adsorption when compared to
   plasma-polymerized coatings and pristine poly(ethyleneterephthalate)
   (PET). Moreover, almost no platelet adhesion was observed after 15 min
   perfusion in whole blood. Altogether, our results suggest that primary
   amine-rich plasma-polymerized coatings offer a promising stable and
   versatile method for PEG grafting in order to create nonfouling and
   nonthrombogenic surfaces and micropatterns.}},

Abstract = {{The ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR) manufacturing process includes
   gasification of the feedstock, conversion of the resulting synthesis gas
   into methanol followed by the production of olefins (ethylene and
   propylene) by the methanol-to-olefins process, and polymerization of the
   monomers into EPR. A hypothetical northern bleached kraft pulp facility
   with a capacity of 1000 metric tons/day was considered as the biomass
   receiving site for the EPR production. Two scenarios were considered for
   the base case: (1) gasification of 100\% of the black liquor produced by
   the kraft pulp mill (85 kt EPR/year) and (2) a 30\% increase in pulp
   production and use of the corresponding extra black liquor obtained in
   the pulp process for the production of EPR (debottlenecking scenario, 27
   kt EPR/year). The base case was compared with a process alternative in
   which black liquor was replaced by biomass (50-100 kt EPR/year) and also
   with another route based on the purchase of bioethanol and its
   subsequent dehydration to ethylene and propylene (85 kt EPR/year).
   Order-of-magnitude capital and operating costs were estimated, and
   internal rates of return (IRRs) were calculated relative to the level of
   risk of the different process pathways. Sensitivity analysis was
   conducted for key parameters. The variables with the most important
   effects on the economics of the gasification routes were capital
   investment and EPR price. In the case of the ethanol dehydration route,
   purchased ethanol price also had a significant importance. Of the
   gasification routes, the debottlenecking case presented the most
   promising economics, mainly due to a reasonable capital investment (237
   million US dollars {[}USD]) with satisfactory IRR (26\%) and payback
   time (3.3 years). The bioethanol-dehydration route showed the most
   attractive economic metrics (USD 220 million capital expenditure, 36\%
   IRR, and 2.4-year payback time).}},

Abstract = {{Surface modification of non-viral gene delivery nanocarriers may provide
   advanced features such as receptor targeting, endosomal escape and
   nuclear import. We here report the design of a versatile and tunable
   immobilization protocol to functionalize nanocarriers for improved
   transient gene expression. Our strategy is based on specific
   interactions occurring between a coil-tagged ligand and a complementary
   coil-functionalized nanocarrier. As a proof of concept, targeting of
   DNA/polyethylenimine polyplexes to the epidermal growth factor receptor
   of A431 cells was investigated. Coiled-coil-mediated oriented tethering
   of epidermal growth factor triggered a drastic increase of the
   internalization rate of the targeted polyplexes. To explore the
   tunability of our platform, surface density of targeting ligand was
   varied; our results indicated that the internalization rate varied with
   the ligand-to-polyplex ratio in a ``switch mode{''} fashion. This work
   prefigures possible avenues for our coiled-coil platform in multiplex
   functionalization to address transient gene expression bottlenecks in
   recombinant protein production. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by

Abstract = {{Mechanical environment is one of the regulating factors involved in the
   process of longitudinal bone growth. Non-physiological compressive
   loading can lead to infantile and juvenile musculoskeletal deformities
   particularly during growth spurt. We hypothesized that tissue mechanical
   behavior in sub-regions (reserve, proliferative and hypertrophic zones)
   of the growth plate is related to its collagen and proteoglycan content
   as well as its collagen fiber orientation. To characterize the strain
   distribution through growth plate thickness and to evaluate biochemical
   content and collagen fiber organization of the three histological zones
   of growth plate tissue. Distal ulnar growth plate samples (N = 29) from
   4-week old pigs were analyzed histologically for collagen fiber
   organization (N = 7) or average zonal thickness (N = 8), or trimmed into
   the three average zones, based on the estimated thickness of each
   histological zone, for biochemical analysis of water, collagen and
   glycosaminoglycan content (N = 7). Other samples (N = 7) were tested in
   semi-confined compression under 10 \% compressive strain. Digital images
   of the fluorescently labeled nuclei were concomitantly acquired by
   confocal microscopy before loading and after tissue relaxation. Strain
   fields were subsequently calculated using a custom-designed 2D digital
   image correlation algorithm. Depth-dependent compressive strain patterns
   and collagen content were observed. The proliferative and hypertrophic
   zone developed the highest axial and transverse strains, respectively,
   under compression compared to the reserve zone, in which the lowest
   axial and transverse strains arose. The collagen content per wet mass
   was significantly lower in the proliferative and hypertrophic zones
   compared to the reserve zone, and all three zones had similar
   glycosaminoglycan and water content.Polarized light microscopy showed
   that collagen fibers were mainly organized horizontally in the reserve
   zone and vertically aligned with the growth direction in the
   proliferative and hypertrophic zones. Higher strains were developed in
   growth plate areas (proliferative and hypertrophic) composed of lower
   collagen content and of vertical collagen fiber organization. The
   stiffer reserve zone, with its higher collagen content and collagen
   fibers oriented to restrain lateral expansion under compression, could
   play a greater role of mechanical support compared to the proliferative
   and hypertrophic zones, which could be more susceptible to be involved
   in an abnormal growth process.}},

Abstract = {{Emerging nonvolatile memories (ENVMs) such as phase-change random access
   memories (PCRAMs) or oxide-based resistive random access memories
   (OxRRAMs) are promising candidates to replace Flash and Static Random
   Access Memories in many applications. This paper introduces a novel set
   of building blocks for field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) using
   ENVMs. We propose an ENVM-based configuration point, a look-up table
   structure with reduced programming complexity and a high-performance
   switchbox arrangement. We show that these blocks yield an improvement in
   area and write time of up to 3x and 33x, respectively, versus a regular
   Flash implementation. By integrating the designed blocks in an FPGA, we
   demonstrate an area and delay reduction of up to 28\% and 34\%,
   respectively, on a set of benchmark circuits. These reductions are due
   to the ENVM 3-D integration and to their low on-resistance state value.
   Finally, we survey many flavors of the technologies and we show that the
   best results in terms of area and delay are obtained with Pt/TiO2/Pt
   stack, while the lowest leakage power is achieved by InGeTe stack.}},

Abstract = {{Optimal assessment of the overall state of the degradation affecting
   sewer systems requires consideration of both the hydraulic and the
   structural aspects. This work identifies a set of 15 factors-pertaining
   to both degradation aspects-as primary and constituting the framework
   for hierarchical structuring of the condition states. The relative
   importance of these factors was determined by the analytic hierarchy
   process (AHP). The proposed model was successfully applied to assess the
   current degradation state of the sewer network in Saint-Hyacinthe,
   Quebec. The relative significance effect, assessing prevalence of either
   the hydraulic or the structural criteria in the degradation process, was
   established through sensitivity analysis. The outcome indicates that
   hydraulic factors have to be integrated in the pipe-deterioration model
   as well as the structural factors. With a reference case set at w(s) =
   0.5 (i.e., structural and hydraulic criteria having the same
   significance level), results remained conservative most of the time.
   Even if the AHP technique was already applied in sewers and water mains
   as shown in the literature, this paper is unique in that the AHP
   technique is used to combine a large number (fifteen) of structural and
   hydraulic criteria and subcriteria. The proposed model will enable
   researchers and municipal engineers to weigh the structural criterion
   against the hydraulic criterion to achieve adequate intervention that is
   carefully planned through a flexible tool outlaying a hierarchy of
   scores reflecting the infrastructure under consideration. DOI:

   a frequency-independent viscosity. In addition, at high frequencies
   where the behavior of the matrix should be dominant, a lower complex
   viscosity of the nanocomposites was observed due to PET degradation in
   the presence of the organoclays. The high-frequency data were used to
   estimate the matrix degradation using the Maron-Pierce equation. The
   apparent molecular weight of the PET matrix was found to decrease from
   65 kg/mol for the neat PET to 30 kg/mol for a PET nanocomposite
   containing 8 wt\% CloisiteA (R); 30B. The apparent yield stress in the
   nanocomposites was determined using the Herschel-Bulkley model. Yield

Abstract = {{Oxidative torrefaction of sawdust with a carrier gas containing 3-6\%
   O-2 was investigated in a TG and a fluidized bed reactor, with the
   properties of the torrefied sawdust and pellets compared with
   traditional torrefaction without any O-2, as well as the dry raw
   material. It is found that the oxidative torrefaction process produced
   torrefied sawdust and pellets of similar properties as normally
   torrefied sawdust and corresponding pellets, especially on the density,
   energy consumption for pelletization, higher heating value and energy
   yield. For moisture absorption and hardness of the torrefied pellets,
   the oxidative torrefaction process showed slightly poor but negligible
   performance. Therefore, it is feasible to use oxygen laden combustion
   flue gases as the carrier gas for torrefaction of biomass. Besides,
   torrefied sawdust can be made into dense and strong pellets of high
   hydrophobicity at a higher die temperature than normally used in the
   production of traditional control pellets. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Conventional and Reciprocal Approaches to the Inverse Dipole
   Localization Problem for N-20-P-20 Somatosensory Evoked Potentials}},

Abstract = {{The non-invasive localization of the primary sensory hand area can be
   achieved by solving the inverse problem of electroencephalography (EEG)
   for N-20-P-20 somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs). This study
   compares two different mathematical approaches for the computation of
   transfer matrices used to solve the EEG inverse problem. Forward
   transfer matrices relating dipole sources to scalp potentials are
   determined via conventional and reciprocal approaches using individual,
   realistically shaped head models. The reciprocal approach entails
   calculating the electric field at the dipole position when scalp
   electrodes are reciprocally energized with unit current-scalp potentials
   are obtained from the scalar product of this electric field and the
   dipole moment. Median nerve stimulation is performed on three healthy
   subjects and single-dipole inverse solutions for the N-20-P-20 SEPs are
   then obtained by simplex minimization and validated against the primary
   sensory hand area identified on magnetic resonance images. Solutions are
   presented for different time points, filtering strategies,
   boundary-element method discretizations, and skull conductivity values.
   Both approaches produce similarly small position errors for the
   N-20-P-20 SEP. Position error for single-dipole inverse solutions is
   inherently robust to inaccuracies in forward transfer matrices but
   dependent on the overlapping activity of other neural sources.
   Significantly smaller time and storage requirements are the principal
   advantages of the reciprocal approach. Reduced computational
   requirements and similar dipole position accuracy support the use of
   reciprocal approaches over conventional approaches for N-20-P-20 SEP
   source localization.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical model of a recently invented magnetless nonreciprocal and
   gyrotropic traveling-wave ring metamaterial is developed. The
   metamaterial is, in fact, a metasurface, which consists of a 2D periodic
   array of pairs of broadside-parallel micro-rings loaded with a
   semiconductor-based unidirectional component. It emulates the operation
   of ferrites by inducing a rotating magnetic moment in the ring pairs.
   However, instead of requiring a magnetostatic bias, it operates with an
   electrostatic voltage bias, thus avoiding the classical issues related
   to permanent magnets in ferrites. The metamaterial has two modes of
   operation: a desired magnetic mode and a parasitic electric mode, which
   are related to the excitation of equal and opposite currents in the two
   rings of the pairs, respectively. The metamaterial exhibits these
   magnetic and electric responses when excited by a uniform magnetic and
   electric field, respectively. The magnetic response is analyzed through
   a transmission line model with a distributed voltage source that
   incorporates the voltage impressed in the rings by the external field.
   The magnetic moment and the subsequent magnetic polarizability are
   related to a traveling-wave resonance along the ring pair. For a
   perfectly matched unidirectional component, this resonance, and hence
   the magnetic polarizability, are lossless. However, in the presence of
   mismatch, the metamaterial becomes lossy, due to reflection and
   absorption of power at the ports of the component. Comparisons with
   full-wave simulations show the validity of the proposed model.}},

Abstract = {{Two versions of an operational giant magnetoimpedance (GMI)-based
   magnetometer, one of which is capable of working in an unshielded
   geomagnetic field, has been design, built and benchmarked against a
   commercial fluxgate magnetometer. The sensing element consists of a
   detection coil, strongly coupled to the GMI wire, in a two-port
   configuration. Its optimization is based on the surface impedance tensor
   of the sensing element, in which we include parasitic capacitance and
   geometric parameters of the coil. Conditions for optimizing the
   electronic noise level are deduced from the model recently published in
   (IEEE Sensors Journal, vol. 11, no. 6, pp. 1317-1324, 2011.). The
   optimized sensor and its conditioning electronics are operated in a
   field-locked loop, using an external coil or the detection coil for
   feedback. Experimental noise performance correlates well with that
   expected from the sensitivity and noise models and are comparable to
   those of a commercial Flux-Gate magnetometer, offering a low-cost
   solution for high sensitivity magnetometry. However, the proposed GMI
   magnetometers still exhibit significant 1/f noise.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new method for the calculation of leakage inductances
   between short-circuited windings is proposed. The main objective is to
   find an analytical alternative to the finite-element method (FEM) for
   the computation of short-circuit inductances in electromagnetic
   transients-type (EMT-type) programs. Typical EMT-type tools do not
   provide complex FEM-based computation engines for this sole purpose. The
   new approach is derived from the method of images and uses analytical
   formulations for magnetic vector potential and energy developed in this
   work. It is shown that the difference between the inductance calculated
   with the FEM in 2-D and that computed with the method of images
   decreases as the number of layers of images increases. Also, it is
   demonstrated that the classical approach, based on an axial flux
   distribution, can lead to considerable error if the windings have
   unequal heights and if they are located far from the core yokes.}},

Abstract = {{ZBLAN fiber has been vastly investigated over the past decades since it
   has a broad wavelength transparent region. Therefore, to use it at its
   maximum potential in multiple applications such as in fiber lasers,
   amplifiers, laser cooling or infrared super continuum generation, it is
   important to know its intrinsic material properties. We have
   investigated stimulated Brillouin scattering in a single mode ZBLAN
   fiber, we believe for the first time, for crucial information on
   acousto-optic properties. A frequency shift of 7.76 GHz from the pump is
   observed and the Brillouin gain bandwidth is measured to be 38 MHz. We
   compared this data to a standard SMF-28 fiber and bulk ZBLAN. We
   calculate fundamental properties in the fiber such as phonon lifetime,
   attenuation and longitudinal velocity, the electrostrictive constant,
   the longitudinal elasto-optic Pockels coefficient and the maximum
   Brillouin gain constant. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TURBOMACHINERY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This work investigates the effect of tip clearance size and operating
   temperature on the predictions of the critical rotor speed at which
   nonsynchronous vibrations (NSV) can be encountered in a turbine engine
   axial flow compressor. It has been proposed that the tangential tip
   clearance flow, observed at high blade loading near stall, can act as an
   impinging resonant jet on the upcoming blades and could be the
   underlying physics behind NSV. A model, in the form of an equation to
   predict the critical blade tip speed at which NSV can occur, was
   proposed based on the Jet-Core Feedback Theory and was experimentally
   verified by Thomassin et al. (2008, ``Experimental Demonstration to the
   Tip Clearance Flow Resonance Behind Compressor NSV,{''} Proceedings of
   GT2008: ASME Turbo Expo Power for Land, Sea and Air, Berlin, Germany,
   Jun. 9-13, Paper No. GT2008-50303). In the equation, a factor k that was
   called the ``tip instability convection coefficient{''} was measured
   experimentally and found to be influenced by the tip clearance size and
   operating temperature. This factor has a significant impact on the
   accuracy of the NSV predictions obtained using the proposed model. This
   paper propose a numerical experiment to determine the effect of tip
   clearance size and temperature on k, in order to improve the critical
   NSV tip speed predictions using the proposed model. A review of the NSV
   model is presented along with the relevant background theory on the
   subject. Two different blade geometries are simulated to provide a
   generic approach to the study. The leakage flow velocity is calculated
   to estimate k and a correlation is proposed to model the behavior of the
   k parameter as a function of the tip clearance size. The latter was
   found to significantly improve the critical NSV speed predictions. The
   effect of operating temperature on k is also discussed. Finally, the
   variation of k with the aerodynamic loading is assessed and compared
   with available data in the literature to strengthen the generic nature
   of the results. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4006401]}},

Volume = {{144}},

Pages = {{83-89}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated the dc and ac conductivities of Se75Te20Sn5 glass
   from 80 to 290 K in the frequency range 40 to 10(6) Hz. The behavior of
   the ac conductivity with temperature, T, is similar to that observed in
   many chalcogenide glasses. In this frequency range the ac conductivity
   sigma(omega) is proportional to omega (s) . The frequency exponent shows
   a T dependence. The experimental data have been analyzed using the
   modified bi-polaron correlated barrier hopping model, which assumes that
   the relaxation time should contain a Meyer-Neldel rule term. It is
   observed that this model is consistent with temperature dependent dc
   conductivity, sigma (dc), ac conductivity, sigma (ac), and s, for
   activation energies above 0.1 eV. At high frequency, that is, low
   activation energy, the behavior changes. We suggest that in this regime,
   the carriers may tunnel rather than hopping. We also present a
   correlation between the residual ac prefactor sigma (00)(omega) and the
   Meyer-Neldel temperature (T (MN)), similar to that previously reported
   for dc conductivity. This similarity points strongly to the dc and ac
   conduction mechanisms being the same.

Abstract = {{The widespread observation of the Meyer-Neldel rule has been explained
   as associated with large activation energies, requiring the accumulation
   or annihilation of a large number of excitations for a kinetic event to
   take place. The characteristic Meyer-Neldel or isokinetic temperature is
   then proportional to the energy of these excitations divided by a
   coupling constant. For disordered materials at low excitation energies,
   a similar relation has been proposed, involving the width of bandtails
   or of Gaussian distributions, a measure of disorder. This similarity has
   resulted in interpreting high activation energy results, for which it
   cannot be applicable, using this description. We show that this leads to
   contradictions with experiments as well as to logical contradictions.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between nanoparticles (NP), humans and the environment are
   not fully understood yet. Moreover, frameworks aiming at protecting
   human health have not been adapted to NP but are nonetheless applied to
   NP-related activities. Consequently, business organizations currently
   have to deal with NP-related risks despite the lack of a proven
   effective method of risk-management. To respond to these concerns and
   fulfill the needs of populations and industries, EquiNanos was created
   as a largely interdisciplinary provincial research team in Canada.
   EquiNanos consists of eight platforms with different areas of action,
   from adaptive decision-aid tool to public and legal governance, while
   including biological monitoring. EquiNanos resources aim at responding
   to the concerns of the Quebec nanotechnology industry and public health
   authorities. Our mandate is to understand the impact of NP on human
   health in order to protect the population against all potential risks
   emerging from these high-priority and rapidly expanding innovative
   technologies. From the Clinical Editor: In this paper by Canadian
   authors an important framework is discussed with the goal of acquiring
   more detailed information and establishing an infrastructure to evaluate
   the interaction between nanoparticles and living organisms, with the
   ultimate goal of safety and risk management of the rapidly growing
   fields of nanotechnology-based biological applications. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Quantum metrology(1) uses entanglement(2-5) and other quantum effects(6)
   to improve the sensitivity of demanding measurements-(7-9). Probing of
   delicate systems demands high sensitivity from limited probe energy and
   has motivated the field's key benchmark-the standard quantum limit(10).
   Here we report the first entanglement-enhanced measurement of a delicate
   material system. We non-destructively probe an atomic spin ensemble by
   means of near-resonant Faraday rotation, a measurement that is limited
   by probe-induced scattering in quantum-memory and spin-squeezing
   applications(6,11-13). We use narrowband, atom-resonant NOON states to
   beat the standard quantum limit of sensitivity by more than five
   standard deviations, both on a per-photon and per-damage basis. This
   demonstrates quantum enhancement with fully realistic loss and noise,
   including variable-loss effects(14-16). The experiment opens the way to
   ultra-gentle probing of single atoms(17), single molecules(18), quantum
   gases(19) and living cells(20).}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{485-495}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Brain imaging studies have reported age-related differences in brain
   activation for attentional control functions, such as inhibition and
   task-switching. However, age-related differences in brain activation
   patterns in more than one attentional control task have rarely been
   studied in the same group of participants. In this study, younger and
   older adults completed a modified Stroop task with interference and
   switching conditions, using functional near infra-red spectroscopy.
   While interference did not reveal any significant activation of the
   prefrontal cortex in younger adults, switching produced an increased
   activation bilaterally in both the anterior dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex (DLPFC) and the anterior ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC).
   In older adults, an isolated right and left anterior DLPFC activation
   was observed even in the non-executive conditions of the Stroop task
   (color denomination) and the interference condition revealed activation
   mostly in the posterior left DLPFC and bilateral VLPFC with a small
   right anterior DLPFC component. Specific to older adults, switching
   induced an increased activation spread out bilaterally over the
   prefrontal cortex in the bilateral anterior DLPFC, the posterior left
   DLPFC and bilateral VLPFC. These results suggest that for both older and
   younger adults, inhibition and switching are associated with distinct
   patterns of prefrontal activation and that age-related differences exist
   in these patterns such that prefrontal activation seems to be more
   spread out at different sites in older adults. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Journal = {{RESEARCH IN ENGINEERING DESIGN}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-18}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The innovation process may be divided into three main parts: the front
   end (FE), the new product development (NPD) process, and the
   commercialization. Every NPD process has a FE in which products and
   projects are defined. However, companies tend to begin the stages of FE
   without a clear definition or analysis of the process to go from
   Opportunity Identification to Concept Generation; as a result, the FE
   process is often aborted or forced to be restarted. Koen's Model for the
   FE is composed of five phases. In each of the phases, several tools can
   be used by designers/managers in order to improve, structure, and
   organize their work. However, these tools tend to be selected and used
   in a heuristic manner. Additionally, some tools are more effective
   during certain phases of the FE than others. Using tools in the FE has a
   cost to the company, in terms of time, space needed, people involved,
   etc. Hence, an economic evaluation of the cost of tool usage is
   critical, and there is furthermore a need to characterize them in terms
   of their influence on the FE. This paper focuses on decision support for
   managers/designers in their process of assessing the cost of
   choosing/using tools in the core front end (CFE) activities identified
   by Koen, namely Opportunity Identification and Opportunity Analysis.
   This is achieved by first analyzing the influencing factors (firm
   context, industry context, macro-environment) along with data collection
   from managers followed by the automatic construction of fuzzy decision
   support models (FDSM) of the discovered relationships. The decision
   support focuses upon the estimated investment needed for the use of
   tools during the CFE. The generation of FDSMs is carried out
   automatically using a specialized genetic algorithm, applied to learning
   data obtained from five experienced managers, working for five different
   companies. The automatically constructed FDSMs accurately reproduced the
   managers' estimations using the learning data sets and were very robust
   when validated with hidden data sets. The developed models can be easily
   used for quick financial assessments of tools by the person responsible
   for the early stage of product development within a design team. The
   type of assessment proposed in this paper would better suit product
   development teams in companies that are cost-focused and where the
   trade-offs between what (material), who (staff), and how long (time) to
   involve in CFE activities can vary a lot and hence largely influence
   their financial performances later on in the NPD process.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new stochastic simulation method that builds
   two-dimensional images by assembling together square image pieces called
   blocks. The blocks are taken from a reference image. Our method, called
   patchwork simulation method (PSM), enforces pattern continuity in the
   image. Moreover, PSM allows to control the image local-mean histogram.
   This histogram bin-frequencies can be set to user-defined target values
   that may differ from the reference image local-mean histogram. This
   flexibility enhances the PSM generality by enlarging the set of all
   possible simulations. The local-mean histogram control is achieved by
   adjusting suitably the transition probabilities that associate a new
   block to an existing neighborhood in the partly simulated image. For
   several types of synthetic images and one polymer blend image, we show
   that PSM reproduces faithfully the reference image visual appearance
   (i.e. patterns are correctly shaped) and that simulated images are
   statistically compatible with the target local-mean histogram. Moreover,
   we show that our method has the ability to produce simulations that
   respect conditional hard data as well as a target local-mean histogram.}},

Journal = {{BIOSTATISTICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{144-159}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Testing zero variance components is one of the most challenging problems
   in the context of linear mixed-effects (LME) models. The usual
   asymptotic chi-square distribution of the likelihood ratio and score
   statistics under this null hypothesis is incorrect because the null is
   on the boundary of the parameter space. During the last two decades many
   tests have been proposed to overcome this difficulty, but these tests
   cannot be easily applied for testing multiple variance components,
   especially for testing a subset of them. We instead introduce a simple
   test statistic based on the variance least square estimator of variance
   components. With this comes a permutation procedure to approximate its
   finite sample distribution. The proposed test covers testing multiple
   variance components and any subset of them in LME models. Interestingly,
   our method does not depend on the distribution of the random effects and
   errors except for their mean and variance. We show, via simulations,
   that the proposed test has good operating characteristics with respect
   to Type I error and power. We conclude with an application of our
   process using real data from a study of the association of hyperglycemia
   and relative hyperinsulinemia.}},

Abstract = {{Thermodynamic modeling is used as a tool to predict the chemistry of
   ash-forming elements in biomass and waste combustion for corrosion- or
   deposition-related issues. One major limitation is the lack of
   comprehensive databases that contain the thermodynamic data of ash
   compounds and phases formed during combustion. The present paper is a
   review of the state-of-the-art of the thermodynamic models and databases
   for ashes of biomass and waste combustion, future developments and the
   coupling of thermodynamic modeling with modeling of physical properties
   of molten ash. Recent developments have improved the accuracy for
   predicting the phase equilibria of alkali salt mixtures. The databases
   are being expanded by taking into account Ca, Pb, and Zn in the salt
   mixtures. Chromates have also been included to to predict the
   stabilities of the corrosion products on boiler heat exchanger
   materials. The thermodynamic data for silicate systems still lack data
   for critical subsystems for biomass ashes. The K2O-CaO-SiO2 system which
   is important for slagging and agglomeration in biomass combustion still
   needs experimental investigations to make accurate modeling possible.
   The thermodynamic data of phosphates are discussed and a new modeling
   approach for molten phosphates is shown for the K2O-P2O5 system. Models
   for predicting physical properties coupled with the thermodynamic
   functions of molten silicates and salts are reviewed. Examples of
   advanced thermodynamic modeling to study ash-related issues in biomass
   combustion are also shows. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Sensitivity of multi-parametric MRI to the compressive state of the

Journal = {{MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers great potential as a
   sensitive and noninvasive technique for describing the alterations in
   mechanical properties, as shown in vitro on intervertebral disc (IVD) or
   cartilage tissues. However, in vivo, the IVD is submitted to complex
   loading stimuli. Thus, the present question focuses on the influence of
   the mechanical loading during an MRI acquisition on the relaxation
   times, magnetization transfer and diffusion parameters within the IVD.
   Methods: An apparatus allowing the compression of isolated IVDs was
   designed and manufactured in acrylonitrile butadiene styrene. IVDs were
   dissected from fresh young bovine tail, measured for their thickness and
   submitted to compression just before the MRI acquisition. Six discs
   received 0\% (platen positioned at the initial disc thickness), 5\%
   (platen positioned at 95\% of the initial disc thickness), 10\%, 20\%
   and 40\% deformation. The MRI parameters were compared between the
   loading states using mean and standard deviation for T1 and T2, and
   matrix subtraction for Magnetization Transfer, fractional anisotropy and
   apparent diffusion coefficient.
   Results: The compression of the IVD did not lead to any significant
   change of the MRI parameters, except for the diffusion that decreased in
   the direction of the compressive stress.
   Discussion: This experimental in vitro study shows that multi-parametric
   MRI on isolated discs in vitro is not sensitive to compression or to the
   partial confined relaxation that followed the compression. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This paper reports an analytical and numerical study of mixed convection
   heat and mass transfer of a binary fluid in a vertical parallel plate
   channel filled with a porous medium. The thermal conditions applied on
   the walls of the system are uniform heat fluxes. Both the cases of
   double-diffusion and Soret-induced convection are considered. The
   governing equations for the porous medium rely on Darcy's model. The
   governing parameters for the problem are the Rayleigh number, Ra, Peclet
   number, Pe, Lewis number, Le, buoyancy ratio, phi, aspect ratio of the
   channel \$A = L'/H'\$ and the constant a (a?=?0 for double diffusive
   convection and a?=?1 for Soret induced convection). The resulting
   problem, in the limit of fully developed mixed convection, is solved
   analytically in closed form. A numerical solution of the full governing
   equations is demonstrated to be in good agreement with the analytical
   model. The temperature and velocity fields and the Nusselt and Sherwood
   numbers are obtained in terms of the governing parameters. The possible
   existence of reversed flows in the channel is discussed. (c) 2011

Abstract = {{The Outstanding characteristics of titanium metal matrix composites
   (Ti-MMCs) have brought them up as promising materials in different
   industries, such as aerospace and biomedical. They exhibit high
   mechanical and physical properties, in addition to their low weight,
   high stiffness and high wear resistance. The presence of the ceramic
   reinforcements in a metallic matrix further contributes to these
   preferable properties. However, the high abrasive nature of the ceramic
   particles limits greatly the machinability of this class of material, as
   they induce significant tool wear and poor surface finish. In this study
   an attempt is made to find the optimum cutting conditions in terms of
   minimizing the tool wear and surface roughness during machining Ti-MMCs.
   Meta-modeling optimization in performed to achieve the goal.
   In this study the three independent parameters under consideration are
   the cutting speed, feed rate and the depth of cut. The response
   parameters are the surface roughness and the tool wear rate. The
   independent parameters are divided into a set of levels at which the
   experiments are conducted. At each experimental condition the two
   response parameters are measured. Kriging meta-modeling technique is
   used to fit a model to the response parameters in the multi-dimensional
   space. These models are used, in turn, within a multi-objective
   optimization algorithm to find the optimum cutting condition space. The
   above-mentioned algorithm is based on an evolutionary multi-objective
   search technique known as SPEA (Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm).

Abstract = {{An attentive vision method for thermal stress detection and monitoring
   using a multi-scale spatiotemporal attention operator is proposed for
   monitoring overheating in wafer-scale integrated circuits. This method
   represents a multi-scale and multi-temporal analysis of infrared image
   sequences of the inspected surfaces by an attention operator to detect
   feature points. Such points may indicate possible sources of abnormal
   thermo-mechanical stress and overheating. This operator implements
   linear aggregation of a temporal change filter with a corresponding
   spatial saliency filter using an optimized value of the temporal change
   coefficient to extract the multi-scale feature points. The monitoring is
   mostly carried out through the detection and tracking of stress-relevant
   feature points based on the multiscale area spatial and temporal
   descriptors extracted at the feature points. The experiments conducted
   with infrared image sequences have confirmed the reliability of the
   proposed operator and showed its high potential in surface image
   analysis for monitoring of wafer-scale integrated circuits.}},

Abstract = {{Power markets are modelled as dynamic large population games where
   suppliers and consumers submit their bids in real-time. The agents are
   coupled in their dynamics and cost functions through the price process.
   Here, a common unpredictable partially observed major agent is added to
   the system which represents common unpredictable disturbance factors
   (e.g. wind) and exogenous market factors (e.g. competing energy resource
   prices), etc.
   In previous work, the Mean Field Game (MFG) methodology was used to
   study the limit (Le., infinite population) behaviour of large population
   market systems without a major agent; this results in a decentralized
   algorithm where agents submit their bids solely using statistical
   information on the dynamics of the entire population. When a major agent
   is absent, the system exhibits the standard counter intuitive property
   of MFG solutions that agents need not observe the behaviour (i.e.,
   inputs and state trajectories, market price evolution, etc.) of any
   other agent (individually or collectively) in order that simple
   decentralized control actions achieve a mass epsilon-Nash equilibrium
   (with epsilon vanishing as the population goes to infinity) and
   individual L-2 stability.
   The contribution of this paper is the extension of the MFG theory to
   cover the addition of a major agent to the power market problem. In
   general, the addition of a major agent in the MFG framework makes the
   mean field stochastic in contrast to the situation with purely minor
   agents where the mean field is deterministic.
   In the general situation of sporadic noisy observations of the mean
   field and the state of the major agent, the extended MFG theory (with
   estimation of the mean field and the major agent state) yields simple
   decentralized control laws which achieve a mass epsilon-Nash equilibrium
   (with epsilon vanishing as the population goes to infinity) and
   individual L-2 stability. In this paper, this is carried out for the MFG
   formulation of the power market problem in order to fit the situation
   where sporadic noisy observations of the state of the major agent and of
   the market price are available for recursive mean field state
   estimation.}},

Abstract = {{We study a class of mean field control problems for a large population
   of linear Gaussian quadratic agents, coupled via their partial
   observations. The measurements interference model is assumed to depend
   only on the empirical mean of agents states. In addition, a structural
   assumption is made on the agents' controls which are constrained to be
   linear constant feedbacks on a locally based state estimate.
   We investigate the ability of such a constrained structure to stabilize
   individual agent systems as the number of agents increases to infinity.
   Previous work has shown that a naive approach, whereby the coupling
   interference term is considered deterministic in the limit as is usually
   assumed in mean field approaches, results in poor local estimation
   results and consequently severely limits the stabilization abilities of
   the closed loop structure. Instead, the finite population optimal
   decentralized estimation problem is studied, and a non-recursive optimal
   estimation scheme is presented and tested numerically. This scheme can
   become a solid basis for deriving asymptotic local state estimate
   approximations.}},

Abstract = {{Rigorous privacy mechanisms that can cope with dynamic data are required
   to encourage a wider adoption of large-scale monitoring and decision
   systems relying on end user information. A promising approach to develop
   these mechanisms is to specify quantitative privacy requirements at
   design time rather than as an afterthought, and to rely on signal
   processing techniques to achieve satisfying trade-offs between privacy
   and performance specifications. This paper discusses, from the signal
   processing point of view, an event stream analysis problem introduced in
   the database and cryptography literature. A discrete-valued input signal
   describes the occurrence of events contributed by end users, and a
   system is supposed to provide some output signal based on this
   information, while preserving the privacy of the participants. The
   notion of privacy adopted here is that of event-level differential
   privacy, which provides strong privacy guarantees and has important
   operational advantages. Several mechanisms are described to provide
   differentially private output signals while minimizing the impact on
   performance. These mechanisms demonstrate the benefits of leveraging
   system theoretic techniques to provide privacy guarantees for dynamic
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{The demand response problem is investigated where it is required that
   the mean temperature of a massive number of electric devices associated
   with energy storage (e.g. electric water heaters, electric space
   heaters, etc.) follow a target temperature trajectory computed as part
   of a system wide optimization problem in smart grids. The classical
   control approach is to compute the required signal centrally for each
   device and to send that signal. However, the corresponding computational
   and communication requirements can be forbidding. Instead, in thiS paper
   the presence of large numbers of such devices justifies the use of a
   decentralized mean field control based approach to the problem. A novel
   agent cost structure including an integral term is utilized for this
   purpose. The corresponding system of mean field equations is developed,
   a fixed point analysis is given for a particular case, an is an element
   of-Nash theorem is presented, and numerical simulation results are
   provided.}},

Abstract = {{Smart transducer interfaces are promising technologies for the next
   generation safety-critical avionics applications. In this paper we
   present two fault tolerant smart transducer interface architectures
   based on the IEEE 1451 standard. FPGA is the hardware platform that has
   been selected for the development of the proposed architectures. The
   first interface architecture is a single-chip solution while the second
   one is dual-chip. Reliability and safety analysis for both architectures
   is also carried out. A special attention is paid to the description of
   the single-chip interface implementation using the Spartan-6 LX45T
   Xilinx FPGA. The resulting prototype is used to validate fault tolerance
   mechanisms and real-time performance of the single-chip interface.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the current state-of-the-art in avionics, the adoption of new
   networking technologies and their integration into complex systems
   requires important efforts to guarantee the respect of system level
   requirements. This sets a need for a more effective and systematic
   approach to validate new technological choices and their integration
   process. In this paper, we propose a hardware prototyping platform for
   validating the design of an avionic transducers network in an early
   development stage. The specific implementation reported in this paper
   targets two boards based on a Spartan-6 LX45T Xilinx FPGA. Both boards
   were configured to validate a custom transducers network architecture
   proposed by the authors. The resulting prototype is configured to
   maintain a throughput of at least 1 Mbit/s and to guarantee a
   deterministic traffic on the field bus to conform to actual avionic
   constraints. This paper covers the methodology involved in the design of
   our prototyping platform and highlights some of the advantages it
   offers.}},

Abstract = {{Secondary access to the licensed primary spectrum band at the same time
   as the primary nodes is generally conditioned on the satisfaction of a
   Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirement at the primary transmission (such
   as a Signal-to-Noise-Ratio -SNR- threshold or a primary outage
   probability threshold). Consequently, at low primary SNR that is below a
   cut-off value, secondary transmissions are totally blocked. In this
   paper, we propose a new cooperative scheme for cognitive radio networks,
   where secondary access to the primary spectrum band is granted whether
   or not the primary transmission satisfies its QoS requirement thanks to
   the utilization of secondary relay nodes. Using relay selection and
   proper power allocation at the secondary nodes, we show that the
   proposed scheme allows secondary access with low secondary outage
   performance without degrading the primary outage performance. We also
   compare the proposed scheme to other ones presented in the literature
   and we study the impact of the number of available relay nodes and the
   primary outage threshold value on the primary and secondary outage
   probabilities.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) benefit from several features, such as
   decision-making, spectrum-awareness and reconfigurability, which enable
   them to perform spectrum migration in order to recover the link when the
   operating channel becomes occupied. The time spent for channel migration
   and recovery is a function of the order in which the channels are
   selected to be sensed. For optimal sensing order, the parameters which
   have mostly been considered in the literature are the availability and
   the quality of the channels. Another important parameter is the channel
   stability, which is the duration that a channel remains continuously
   available. We extend in this paper a single-slot model to propose novel
   decision making dynamic programming (DP) models where availability,
   quality and stability of the channels are taken into account.
   Considering the need for differentiation in cognitive radio network, we
   also propose a differentiated dynamic programming model considering
   different classes of traffic where the sensing order is determined based
   on an aggregated cost function. Simulation results show the superiority
   of decision-making based on DP models compared to other common schemes
   such as myopic, random or average-based.}},

Abstract = {{In full duplex relaying, the direct link and the decode and forward
   processing delay are not always negligible. The signal transmitted by
   the source thus interferes, at the destination, with the delayed signal
   retransmitted by the relay. This paper presents a novel full duplex
   transmission scheme based on distributed Alamouti encoding (denoted by
   FDAE) that eliminates the interference problem and combines efficiently
   each transmitted signal and its delayed copy at the destination for
   decode and forward relaying. The performances of FDAE are compared to
   the full duplex system with interference at the destination (denoted by
   FDI) and to the conventional half duplex relaying. The simulation
   results show the harmful effect of the interference problem on the
   end-to-end achievable data rate and on the bit error rate. They also
   show that our proposed scheme provides a highest end-to-end achievable
   data rate and lower bit error rate than FDI due to its ability to take
   advantage of full duplexing while eliminating interference.}},

   called universal-filtered multi-carrier (UFMC), a filtering operation is
   applied to a group of consecutive subcarriers (e.g. a given allocation
   of a single user) in order to reduce out-of-band sidelobe levels and
   subsequently minimize the potential ICI between adjacent users in case
   of asynchronous transmissions. We consider a coordinated multi-point
   (CoMP) reception technique, where a number of base stations (BSs) send
   the received signals from user equipments (UEs) to a CoMP central unit
   (CCU) for joint detection and processing. We examine the impact of
   carrier frequency offset (CFO) on the performance of the proposed scheme
   and compare the results with the performance of cyclic prefix based
   orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (CP-OFDM) systems. We use
   computer experiments to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed
   multi-carrier scheme. The results indicate that the UFMC scheme

Abstract = {{We present our technique for facial keypoint localization in the wild

   global keypoint configurations of the returned neighbours. Neighbours
   are also used to define restricted areas of the input image in which we
   apply local discriminative classifiers. We then employ an energy
   function based minimization approach to combine local classifier
   predictions with the dynamically estimated joint keypoint configuration
   model. Our method is able place 68 keypoints on in the wild facial
   imagery with an average localization error of less than 10\% of the
   inter-ocular distance for almost 50\% of the challenge test examples.
   Our model therein increased the yield of low error images over the

Abstract = {{The sheet resistance of graphene has been recently reduced below the
   level of previous optically transparent conductive materials. With its
   additional advantage of mechanical flexibility and low cost, graphene is
   one of the best candidates for future transparent electronics. We
   investigate here the possibility of using graphene for transparent and
   flexible microwave structures. Specifically, we study the waveguiding
   and nonreciprocal properties of various planar microwave transmission
   lines, using the 2D finite difference frequency domain (FDFD) technique.
   It is shown that reciprocal graphene based structures of acceptably low
   loss levels are achievable using graphene sheets of the lowest available
   resistivity, on the other hand graphene based non-reciprocal structures
   are accompanied by prohibitive loss due to a fundamental trade-off
   between nonreciprocity and carrier density in graphene.}},

Abstract = {{This paper propose a novel Spur Stepped Impedance Resonator (SSIR).
   Developed from the classical Stepped Impedance Resonator (SIR) without
   additional or complicated circuit occupying, almost keeping the same
   compact size and quality factor, the SSIR has tunable spurious
   resonances while keeping fundamental resonance frequency almost
   unchanged, and a tapped SSIR will produce tunable transmission zeros
   without interfering with the fundamental resonance or the loaded
   quality. A simple demo application of SSIR on designing bandpass filter
   with extended stopband is proposed, fabricated and measured.}},

Abstract = {{A low-cost frequency modulated feedback-loop oscillator for high-power
   microwave transmitter on the basis of a Ferrite Loaded Substrate
   Integrated Waveguide (FLSIW) cavity is proposed and demonstrated for the
   first time. The proposed structure is low-cost as its fabrication
   involves standard PCB process and the integration of high-power handling
   ferrite allowing the combination of an oscillator and high-power
   amplifier within a single device. With the application of an external
   magnetic bias, the resonant frequency of the FLSIW cavity is controlled
   to adjust the feedback-loop oscillation conditions and tune the
   oscillator frequency. It is also demonstrated that, by applying an
   alternating magnetic bias, the output signal of the oscillator can be
   modulated. The validation of the proposed oscillator consists of a
   multilayer and single layer X-band prototype. The fabricated multilayer
   component is based on a four ferrite slab loaded SIW cavity achieving a
   16\% frequency tuning. The oscillator with a frequency tuning range of
   210 MHz centered at 11.91 GHz with a fairly constant output power and a
   phase noise of 90 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz offset is demonstrated. The single
   layer prototype is controlled by a double winded electromagnet to
   achieve both frequency tuning and modulation. A 10 kHz frequency
   modulation is demonstrated. This type of oscillator is suitable for
   low-cost high-power microwave transmitter for possible use in FMCW

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio front-end design over 60 GHz frequency range is highly
   dependent on the performance of antenna front end. This work presents a
   novel technique to design fixed beam-forming smart antenna with four
   independent orthogonal beams. Vertical interconnect proposed in
   substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) technology is used to design the
   space saving beam-forming network. Analog phase shifter based on Butler
   matrix is used to drive the radiating aperture. The complete phased
   array system is fabricated by using low-cost PCB technology. For each
   input port, 60 GHz right hand circularly polarized (RHCP) smart antenna
   gain is measured as 13 dBc. The designed RHCP phased array system is
   able to form beams in two dimensional (2-D) scan space. The designed
   V-band smart antenna system with circularly polarized scanned patterns
   will satisfy today's cognitive radio front-end requirements.}},

Abstract = {{A new interconnect between substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) and
   coplanar waveguide (CPW) is introduced. Contrary to similar
   interconnects to CPW or grounded CPW (GCPW), in which the top plate of
   the SIW is transitioned to the center conductor of the CPW, the new
   design connects the bottom plate of the SIW to the center conductor of
   the CPW by means of a row of via holes. It is thus termed `inverted'
   interconnect. A parametric analysis of the two design parameters
   involved determines the interconnect design which is validated by two
   commercially available field solvers. A back-to-back transition is
   prototyped and measured. Experimental results agree well with
   theoretical predictions and achieve a return loss of better than 16 dB
   over the entire 18 - 28 GHz range with a maximum insertion loss of 1.2
   dB. The comparative values of a non-inverted back-to-back SIW-to-CPW
   prototype are 15 dB and 1.5 dB, respectively. Moreover, the non-inverted
   transition requires a larger substrate area.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, for the first time a novel 10W half mode substrate
   integrated waveguide (HMSIW) power amplifier (PA) with high power added
   efficiency (PAE) is presented. The matching network (MN) of the HMSIW PA
   is designed with microstrip-to-HMSIW transition and HMSIW bandpass
   filter. The HMSIW bandpass filter is employed in both input and output
   MNs to suppress the 2nd harmonic of 2.14 GHz, according to the
   measurement, the insertion loss of the HMSIW bandpass filter at 4.28 GHz
   is 36.1 dB while at 2.14 GHz is 0.5 dB. The impedance matching for the
   fundamental frequency 2.14 GHz is realized by adding one inductive
   metalized post in the HMSIW bandpass filter. One high PAE HMSIW-based
   10W PA using GaN HEMT at 2.14 GHz is designed, fabricated, and measured.
   Measured results show that the maximum PAE is 71.9 \% with 41.4 dBm
   output power and the maximum gain is 16.9 dB. At the design frequency of
   2.14 GHz, the size of the proposed HMSIW-based PA is comparable with
   other microstrip-based PAs.}},

Abstract = {{Harmonic radar architectures present systems of wireless detection
   operating at multiple harmonic carrier frequencies. The noise and
   sensitivity of a harmonic radar system, which is developed at 12 GHz and
   24 GHz for vital signs detection, are studied numerically and
   experimentally. The received signal power of the radar system is
   analyzed numerically as a function of the distance, taking into account
   the radar cross section (RCS) of the patient chest. The numerical data
   are compared with results obtained with single carrier frequency system.
   The total noise is a combination of thermal noise, residual phase noise,
   and flicker noise that presents the most elevated factor influencing the
   detection at baseband. Experimental results show that with the harmonic
   radar, the flicker noise can be reduced by 20dB at around 1Hz baseband
   frequency.}},

Abstract = {{The standard way to detect known digital objects inside a stream of
   bytes consists in using a string matching algorithm initialized with a
   dictionary containing the objects to detect. Depending on the
   application, the algorithm may be implemented in software or with
   dedicated hardware, to speedup the processing. Nevertheless, such
   approach requires an automaton with a complexity that is linear in the
   size of the dictionary. Large dictionaries result in large automatons
   that must be stored in high-latency memories, therefore limiting the
   processing speed. We propose a fast algorithm tailored to FPGA
   implementation to detect the transfer of known digital objects from
   their fragments. For illustrative purpose, the algorithm is applied to
   the detection of more than 100 000 known JPEG files by just inspecting
   the IP packets captured during an FTP transfer. Results demonstrate
   excellent true/false positive rates with nearly no limit on the number
   of objects to detect and the transfer rates.}},

   false positives. In order to allow for automated reasoning on the

   of comprehensive and extensible ontologies, and implemented fusion and
   detection algorithms as simple rules in Ontologic Web Language
   Description Logic (OWL-DL), using the Semantic Query-Enhance Web Rule
   Language (SQWRL). To illustrate and evaluate our approach, we use one of
   the attack scenarios of the DARPA 2000 dataset. The results obtained
   show that our approach can reduce false positives, while achieving the

Abstract = {{Data from four field studies are analyzed to find the patterns of
   knowledge acquisition activity in software development projects with
   respect to other cognitive activities such as documentation, coding and
   V\&V. The data are obtained from self-recorded activity time slips
   approach. Data are codified based on an information source model, which
   is related to Nonaka and Takeuchi's knowledge creation model. It shows
   that knowledge acquisition activities account for almost 15\% of the
   total effort. We also find out that this effort, in most cases, cannot
   be restricted to the first phase of the project during requirement and
   architectural design, which is expected from waterfall or disciplined
   processes. About half of the learning is done during the code
   implementation even within a disciplined process. This finding is in
   line with one value of the Agile philosophy that promotes team
   interactions and users involvement for the whole project duration.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical simulations are becoming more and more a key step in designing
   an integrated building + energy system. The use of a detailed numerical
   model and an accurate calculation algorithm permits us not only to study
   the influence of design parameters, but also to evaluate the building
   energy demand and indoor comfort conditions. The computational effort in
   modelling the building behaviour might become a limit in terms of
   simulation time, in particular in the case of complex systems. This is
   evident when an integrated control of building and thermal energy system
   is performed, because of the need of a short time step (1 to 5 minutes)
   for control purposes. In this sense, a clear edge between architectural
   and energy modelling has to be drawn. In this paper, a methodology for
   simplifying a detailed building model has been presented, by defining
   phases, quantitative figures, limits and uncertainty of the results.
   Such procedure is replicable and could be useful during any numerical
   modelling process. With reference to a three-story apartment building,
   the influence of (1) the algorithm for short-and long-wave radiation,
   (2) building and surrounding context's shadings, (3) different levels of
   geometric surface information have been investigated. For each phase,
   building's energy balance and simulation runtime has been reported.
   Additionally, the reliability and adherence of simulation outputs have
   been inspected by comparing the numerical model response with a whole
   year of monitoring data.}},

Abstract = {{In sandy aquifers, stratification results in a range of values for the
   hydraulic conductivity K, which can be evaluated at three scales. Since
   large-scale tests are more likely to meet preferential flow paths, they
   are also likely to yield larger K values than small-scale tests, which
   may be viewed as a scale effect. The small scale is that of soil
   samples: their quality must be assessed and their grain size
   distribution analyzed to check for mixes of sub-layers, before using
   reliable methods to predict the K values. The middle scale is that of
   field permeability tests for which it is important to respect the
   standards and perform verifications. The large scale is that of pumping
   tests. The paper presents a few case studies of sandy aquifers. Their
   stratification led to unimodal or multimodal grain size distributions.
   For all cases, the K distributions provided consistent images of the
   sandy aquifers. It was then concluded that, after a quality control of
   data and interpretations, there was no scale effect in the aquifers.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents research conducted on the environmental selection of
   materials for product end-of-life. The literature review establishes the
   state of art in the field of environmental material selection. Several
   issues are studied: existing environmental material selection methods,
   parameters and validity of these parameters in terms of their influence
   on the product's life cycle. Subsequently, we describe the proposed
   method which allows the designer to select materials during preliminary
   design. This method is based on fuzzy logic data processing. The product
   end-of-life personalizes material assessment to select the best
   materials for the studied product. Fuzzy logic is the core of the
   proposed method: it allows easier processing of preliminary design data
   than traditional numeric methods. Then, we present a computer
   implementation of the method (software ECMSPEOL). The various operations
   performed by ECMSPEOL are detailed. Case study is presented to verify
   the method's validity. Results are summarized and discussed. Finally, we
   conclude this paper by proposing different avenues of potential

Abstract = {{In this paper we present the techniques used for the University of
   Montreal's team submissions to the 2013 Emotion Recognition in the Wild
   Challenge. The challenge is to classify the emotions expressed by the
   primary human subject in short video clips extracted from feature length
   movies. This involves the analysis of video clips of acted scenes
   lasting approximately one-two seconds, including the audio track which
   may contain human voices as well as background music. Our approach
   combines multiple deep neural networks for different data modalities,
   including: (1) a deep convolutional neural network for the analysis of
   facial expressions within video frames; (2) a deep belief net to capture
   audio information; (3) a deep autoencoder to model the spatio-temporal
   information produced by the human actions depicted within the entire
   scene; and (4) a shallow network architecture focused on extracted
   features of the mouth of the primary human subject in the scene. We
   discuss each of these techniques, their performance characteristics and
   different strategies to aggregate their predictions. Our best single
   model was a convolutional neural network trained to predict emotions
   from static frames using two large data sets, the Toronto Face Database
   and our own set of faces images harvested from Google image search,
   followed by a per frame aggregation strategy that used the challenge
   training data. This yielded a test set accuracy of 35.58\%. Using our
   best strategy for aggregating our top performing models into a single
   predictor we were able to produce an accuracy of 41.03\% on the
   challenge test set. These compare favorably to the challenge baseline
   test set accuracy of 27.56\%.}},

Title = {{Interpolation of Transonic Flows Using a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition
   Method}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{A proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method is used to interpolate
   the flow around an airfoil for various Mach numbers and angles of attack
   in the transonic regime. POD uses a few numerical simulations, called
   snapshots, to create eigenfunctions. These eigenfunctions are combined
   using weighting coefficients to create a new solution for different
   values of the input parameters. Since POD methods are linear, their
   interpolation capabilities are quite limited when dealing with flow
   presenting nonlinearities, such as shocks. In order to improve their
   performance for cases involving shocks, a new method is proposed using
   variable fidelity. The main idea is to use POD to interpolate the
   difference between the CFD solution obtained on two different grids, a
   coarse one and a fine one. Then, for any new input parameter value, a
   coarse grid solution is computed using CFD and the POD interpolated
   difference is added to predict the fine grid solution. This allows some
   nonlinearities associated with the flow to be introduced. Results for
   various Mach numbers and angles of attack are compared to full CFD
   results. The variable fidelity-based POD method shows good improvement
   over the classical approach.}},

Title = {{Development and Validation of a New Boundary Condition for Intake
   Analysis with Distortion}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{The design of an intake for a gas turbine engine involves CFD-based
   investigation and experimental assessment in an intake test rig. In both
   cases, the engine is represented by a mass flux sink, usually positioned
   a few fan radii aft of the real fan face. In general, this approach is
   sufficient to analyze intake geometry for low distortion at the fan
   face, because in this case the interaction of the fan with the inlet
   flow can be neglected. Where there are higher levels of distortion at
   the fan face, the interaction could become more significant and a
   different approach would be preferable. One alternative that takes into
   account the interaction in such cases includes the fan in the analysis
   of the intake, using either a steady or unsteady flow model approach.
   However, this solution is expensive and too computationally intensive to
   be useful in design mode. The solution proposed in this paper is to
   implement a new boundary condition at the fan face which better
   represents the interaction of the fan with the flow in the air intake in
   the presence of distortion. This boundary condition includes a
   simplified fan model and a coupling strategy applied between the fan and
   the inlet. The results obtained with this new boundary condition are
   compared to full 3D unsteady CFD simulations that include the fan.}},

Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{61-74}},
Abstract = {{The spatial and temporal distribution of built space supply plays an
   important role in shaping urban form and thus the general travel pattern
   in an urban area. Within an integrated framework, we are interested in
   modeling the decisions of a builder in terms of when, where, what type,
   and how much built space to build. We present a multidimensional
   discrete-continuous model formulation for the built space supply
   decisions that are based on expected profit maximization. The framework
   is applied to estimate a model for supply of new office space in the
   greater Toronto area (GTA) for the 1986 to 2006 period. To our
   knowledge, this work is the first that models the where, when, how much,
   and what type of office space to build in a single econometric framework
   at a fairly disaggregate spatial zoning system. The results indicate
   risk taker behavior on the builders' part, while market conditions and
   supply of resources (labor, construction cost, etc.) are also found to
   be important factors in decision making.}},

   2 at instant t+t with a given probability. The time delay t is a random
   variable with known probability density function. The system is
   considered in a failed state when both components are failed. The
   proposed replacement policies suggest to replace the system upon failure
   or at age T whichever occurs first. In the first policy, costs and
   durations associated with maintenance activities are supposed to be
   constant. In the second replacement policy, the preventive replacement
   cost depends on the system's state and age. The expected cost per unit
   of time over an infinite span is derived and numerical examples are
   presented. The mathematical model can be used to analyze the stochastic
   dependence on the performance of the system}},

Abstract = {{The problem of processing end-of-life (EOL) aircrafts concerns some
   technological and environmental challenges. Different possibilities are
   offered to the owner(s) of an EOL aircraft, each with its positive and
   negative impacts on the 3 spheres of sustainable development. The EOL
   processing includes 4 major steps: decontamination, disassembly of
   parts, dismantling of the remaining carcass, materials recovery and/or
   landfill. In this work, disassembly of reusable parts for their
   introduction on the second-hand market is discussed. Reusability of
   parts extracted from an airplane is conditional upon compliance with all
   applicable maintenance procedures in disassembly step. When dismantling
   many parts (reusable parts), it is necessary to merge all procedures in
   order to obtain an optimized and rational disassembly approach.
   Maintenance tasks run on an aircraft are grouped in the ``Aircraft
   Maintenance Manual{''} (AMM). The aim of this research is to organize
   the disassembly of reusable equipments with a model, on which structured
   and optimized strategies can be developed (in disassembly). Reusable
   parts disassembly consists in a selective and non-destructive
   disassembly. It is not about developing sequences of operations (given
   in the AMM with the tasks), but arranging maintenance tasks together.
   Execution zone and tasks preparation (preliminary tasks) are important
   criteria. The analysis of the actual literature does not find a suitable
   method for the problem. Thus, aspects of graphical method, wave
   propagation approach, and Petri nets approach in disassembly
   applications are considered to define the model. The proposed model is a
   representation of the entire work that has to be done on an airplane
   (set of tasks to be performed for dismantling equipments). Moreover, it
   has to support different strategies for ``solving{''} a disassembly, and
   guaranteeing collaboration between technicians. An utilization strategy
   is proposed, based on a heuristic resolution. Data acquisition (model
   inputs) can be automatically accomplished with the ``Aircraft
   Maintenance Manual{''}.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers inventory models of (Q, s) type with Q the
   order-quantity and s the order point. In general, an optimal choice of
   control parameters (Q and s) will depend on the characteristics of
   replenishment lead time and the demand process, as well as holding and
   shortage costs. Although many studies have treated lead time as
   constant, focusing only on demand variability, a number of authors have
   shown that a stochastic lead time is an issue that can have significant
   impact on inventory models and systems. This paper addresses the model
   when supply is assumed to have an exponential lead time distribution,
   and the ``customer{''} itself is an exponential unreliable manufacturing
   plant, aiming for a constant mean production rate; thus both supply and
   demand have random characteristics. Under a so-called averaging
   principle approximation, we derive closed form expressions of the
   quantities of interest and illustrate their application in the
   optimization of the Q and s parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Vortex-induced vibration is an important phenomenon for offshore
   engineering. For applications like the piping in the deep water oil
   exploration projects, the mass ratios can be of order of one {[}1].
   Hence, there is a practical need to understand the effects of low mass
   ratio on vortex-induced vibrations to enhance design safety. The main
   purpose of this study is to numerically explore the two degrees of
   freedom (transverse and stream-wise) responses of vortex-induced
   vibrations of a cylinder at low Reynolds number for the limiting case of
   zero mass ratio and zero damping. We aim to characterize the responses.
   In particular, we focus on determining the maximum amplitude values. It
   is a continuation from the work of Etienne and Pelletier who studied
   such behaviors at very low Reynolds number (Re < 50) {[}2].
   We investigate the responses in the following parameter space: Reynolds
   number (75 <= Re <= 175), reduced velocity (5.0 <= U-r <= 11.0) and mass
   ratio (m{*} = \{0,0.1,11) with a fully coupled fluid-structure
   interaction numerical model based on the finite element method.
   Our results are generally in accordance with those from previous works
   for the displacement trajectories, force phase diagram, and the trends
   in frequency response and oscillation amplitude. The maximum transverse
   amplitude is found to be around 0.9 in the studied parameter space. In
   particular; with zero mass ratio, the maximum transverse amplitude
   starts to occur at values of reduced velocity higher than 6.5 for
   Reynolds number larger than 150. This is in contrast to the results of
   Etienne and Pelletier {[}2] who found that the maximum transverse
   amplitude always occurs at the reduced velocity of 6.5 for Reynolds
   number less than 50. Furthermore, with zero mass ratio, the maximum
   transverse amplitude increases when the Reynolds number increases. This
   behavior differs from what was suggested by Williamson and Govardhan
   {[}3] for a cylinder oscillating only in the transverse direction at
   Reynolds numbers in the range of 85 to 200. They found that the Reynolds
   number has no influence on the maximum transverse amplitude.
   We do not notice any response branching in this parameter space.
   However; the results in the present work clearly consist of two distinct
   characteristics. This indicates that the investigated mass ratio values
   encompass the critical mass ratio; whose value is estimated to be around
   0.1 to 0.2.}},

   Investigate Individual and Aggregate Variation in Travel Behaviour}},
Booktitle = {{TRANSPORT SURVEY METHODS: BEST PRACTICE FOR DECISION MAKING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Pages = {{649-671}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Fare validation data from transit smart card automatic fare
   collection (AFC) systems have properties that align with the direction
   of large-scale mobility surveys and the evermore demanding data needs of
   the transit industry. In addition to applications in transit planning
   and service monitoring, travel patterns and behaviour can effectively be
   studied by exploiting the continuous stream of observations from the
   same card. The paper proposes a methodology to enrich fare validation
   data in order to generate information that is hard to obtain with
   traditional travel surveys.
   Methodology/approach - The methodology aims to synthesize
   individual-level attributes by summarizing multi-day validation records
   from each card. These new dimensions are then transposed to various
   levels of aggregation and studied simultaneously in multivariate
   analysis. The methodology can also be applied to synthesize other
   multi-day attributes and is transferable to other modes and other travel
   behaviour studies.
   Findings - Results show that validation data can effectively be used to
   measure the distribution of travel patterns in time and space as well as
   the variation of those phenomena over time. The paper provides several
   examples based on millions of validation records from the metro
   sub-network of Montreal, along with interpretations and some practical
   implications.
   Research limitations/implications - Limitations and bias regarding the
   data and the methodology as well as the strategies to handle them are
   discussed within the context of passive travel survey and travel
   behaviour studies.
   Practical implications - Practitioners in transit planning, operations,
   marketing and modelling can benefit from studying the increasingly
   accessible and massive smart card datasets through a deeper
   understanding of multi-day travel patterns and behaviour of transit
   users.
   Originality/value - This paper outlines a data modelling approach and
   simple-to-implement methodology which exploit the multi-day property of
   fare validation data from a smart card AFC. The concept of multi-day
   attributes is introduced. The analyses show that the approach is
   effective for extracting information on travel behaviour and its
   variation which would otherwise be hard to obtain through traditional
   travel surveys, opening up another dimension of this data source for
   practitioners and transport modellers alike.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a system for wind turbine condition monitoring using
   Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Interference Systems (ANFIS). For this purpose: (1)
   ANFIS normal behavior models for common Supervisory Control And Data
   Acquisition (SCADA) data are developed in order to detect abnormal
   behavior of the captured signals and indicate component malfunctions or
   faults using the prediction error. 33 different standard SCADA signals
   are used and described, for which 45 normal behavior models are
   developed. The performance of these models is evaluated in terms of the
   prediction error standard deviations to show the applicability of ANFIS
   models for monitoring wind turbine SCADA signals. The computational time
   needed for model training is compared to Neural Network (NN) models
   showing the strength of ANFIS in training speed. (2) For automation of
   fault diagnosis Fuzzy Interference Systems (FIS) are used to analyze the
   prediction errors for fault patterns. The outputs are both the condition
   of the component and a possible root cause for the anomaly. The output
   is generated by the aid of rules that capture the existing expert
   knowledge linking observed prediction error patterns to specific faults.
   The work is based on continuously measured wind turbine SCADA data from
   18 turbines of the 2 MW class covering a period of 30 months.
   The system proposed in this paper shows a novelty approach with regard
   to the usage of ANFIS models in this context and the application of the
   proposed procedure to a wide range of SCADA signals. The applicability
   of the set up ANFIS models for anomaly detection is proved by the
   achieved performance of the models. In combination with the FIS the
   prediction errors can provide information about the condition of the
   monitored components.
   In this paper the condition monitoring system is described. Part two
   will entirely focus on application examples and further efficiency
   evaluation of the system. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{264-280}},
Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of production planning of unreliable
   batch processing manufacturing systems. The finished goods are produced
   in lots, and are then transported to a storage area in order to
   continuously meet a constant demand rate. The main objective of this
   work is to jointly determine the optimal lot sizing and optimal
   production control policy that minimise the total expected cost of
   inventory/backlog and transportation, over an infinite time horizon. The
   decision variables are the lot sizing and the production rate. The
   problem is formulated with a stochastic dynamic programming model and
   the impulse control theory is applied to establish the
   Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. Based on a numerical resolution
   of the HJB equations, it is shown that the optimal control policy is
   governed by a base stock policy for production rate control and economic
   lot size for batch processing. A thorough analysis and practical issues
   are addressed with a simulation-based approach. Thus, a combined
   discrete-continuous simulation model is developed to determine the
   optimal parameters of the proposed policy when the failure and repair
   times follow general distributions. The results are illustrated with
   numerical examples and confirmed through sensitivity analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous samples of magnetite@silica and magnetite@silica@silane
   core-shell nanoparticles, previously used as prodrugs, were prepared by
   an experienced chemist, using the same identical equipment and the same

   variations: no two batches were found to have the same surface
   chemistries, showing unexpected Si-O bond scission and amine oxidation.
   Because the preparations used reactions recognized to be mild, and bond
   scission and oxidation were never previously reported for similar
   reactions on larger surfaces, the Fe3O4 nanoparticles that form the
   nanoparticle core appear to have acted as catalysts for these side
   reactions. The intended use of these nanoparticles, as drug carriers, is
   discussed in terms of cytotoxicological and biomedical consequences. (C)

Abstract = {{The development of molecular probes and novel imaging modalities,
   allowing better resolution and specificity, is associated with an
   increased potential for molecular imaging of atherosclerotic plaques
   especially in basic and pre-clinical research applications. In that
   context, a photoacoustic molecular probe based on gold nanoshells
   targeting VCAM-1 in mice (immunonanoshells) was designed. The molecular
   probe was validated in vitro and in vivo, showing no noticeable acute
   toxic effects. We performed the conjugation of gold nanoshells
   displaying near-infrared absorption properties with VCAM-1 antibody
   molecules and PEG to increase their biocompatibility. The resulting
   immunonanoshells obtained under different conditions of conjugation were
   then assessed for specificity and sensitivity. Photoacoustic tomography
   was performed to determine the ability to distinguish gold nanoshells
   from blood both in phantoms and in vivo. Ex vivo optical projection
   tomography of hearts and aortas from atherosclerotic and control mice
   confirmed the selective accumulation of the immunonanoshells in
   atherosclerotic-prone regions in mice, thus validating the utility of
   the probe in vivo in small animals for pre-clinical research. These
   immunonanoshells represent an adequate mean to target atherosclerotic
   plaques in small animals, leading to new tools to follow the effect of
   therapies on the progression or regression of the disease. Copyright (C)

   second-nearest-neighbor formalism (2NN). The Al-Zr MEAM-2NN potential is
   parameterized in this work using ab initio and experimental data found
   in the literature for the AlZr3-L1(2) structure, while its predictive
   ability is confirmed for several other solid structures and for the
   liquid phase. The thermodynamic integration (TI) method is implemented
   in a general MC algorithm in order to evaluate the absolute Gibbs energy
   of the liquid and the fcc solutions. The entropy of mixing calculated
   from the TI method, combined to the enthalpy of mixing and the heat
   capacity data generated from MD/MC simulations performed in the
   isobaric-isothermal/canonical (NPT/NVT) ensembles are used to
   parameterize the Gibbs energy function of all the condensed phases in
   the Al-rich side of the Al-Zr system in a CALculation of PHAse Diagrams
   (CALPHAD) approach. The modified quasichemical model in the pair
   approximation (MQMPA) and the cluster variation method (CVM) in the
   tetrahedron approximation are used to define the Gibbs energy of the
   liquid and the fcc solid solution respectively for their entire range of
   composition. Thermodynamic and structural data generated from our MD/MC
   simulations are used as input data to parameterize these thermodynamic
   models. A detailed analysis of the validity and transferability of the
   Al-Zr MEAM-2NN potential is presented throughout our work by comparing
   the predicted properties obtained from this formalism with available ab
   initio and experimental data for both liquid and solid phases. DOI:

Abstract = {{Au nanoparticle chains embedded in helical Al2O3 nanotubes (nanopeapods)
   are synthesized by annealing carbon nanocoils coated with Au by
   sputtering and Al2O3 by atomic layer deposition. Regular spacing between
   nanoparticles with a sharp size distribution is achieved by
   fragmentation of the Au coating in agreement with the pitch of the
   nanocoils arising from three-dimensional periodical topography of the
   carbon nanocoil templates. A strong plasmonic resonance behavior of the
   fabricated nanopeapods manifests itself in confocal laser scanning
   microscopy by a clear polarization contrast at red wavelengths, which is
   absent in the blue. Numerical simulations confirm an incisive resonance
   enhancement for longitudinal polarization and suggest the nanopeapods as
   promising candidates for highly efficient, ultrathin waveguides. The
   waveguiding properties of the nanopeapods are investigated by electron
   energy-loss spectroscopy and energy-filtered TEM imaging.}},

Abstract = {{The use of direct chill (DC) cast ingot plates of AA2195 alloys has been
   recently extended for large mold applications in the plastics and
   automotive industries. The microstructural evolution of the as-cast
   AA2195 alloy was investigated using the Factsage thermodynamic software
   under both equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions, and was compared
   with the results from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis
   and microstructural observations. The as-cast microstructure exhibited
   the presence of Al2CuMg. Al2Cu and Al2CuLi intermetallic phases formed
   at the aluminum dendrite boundaries, which can be completely dissolved
   in the alpha-Al matrix during the solution treatment. A significant
   improvement in the mechanical properties of the AA2195 cast alloy after
   the T6 heat treatment is attributed to the formation of nano-scale
   theta' (Al2Cu) and T1 (Al2CuLi) precipitates. However, the non-uniform
   distribution of T1 precipitates together with the large size and low
   density indicate that the role of theta' precipitates in strengthening
   the AA2195 cast alloy is more dominant than that of the T1 precipitates,
   in contrast with the strengthening mechanism of the pre-deformed
   AA2195-T8 rolled products. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{We report on the magneto-optical activity of MnP nanoclusters embedded
   in GaP epilayers and MnP thin film as a function of temperature,
   magnetic field, and wavelength in the near infrared and visible. The
   measured Faraday rotation originates from the ferromagnetic
   magnetization of the metallic MnP phase and exhibits a hysteretic
   behavior as a function of an externally applied magnetic field closely
   matching that of the magnetization. The Faraday rotation spectrum of MnP
   shows a magnetoplasmonic resonance whose energy depends on the MnP
   filling factor and surrounding matrix permittivity. At resonance, the
   measured rotary power for the epilayer systems increases by a factor of
   2 compared to that of the MnP film in terms of degrees of rotation per
   MnP thickness for an applied magnetic field of 410 mT. We propose an
   effective medium model, which qualitatively reproduces the Faraday
   rotation and the magnetocircular dichroism spectra, quantitatively
   determines the spectral shift induced by variations in the MnP volume
   fraction, and demonstrates the influence of the shape and orientation
   distributions of ellipsoidal MnP nanoclusters on the magneto-optical
   activity and absorption spectra. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.86.245312}},

Abstract = {{A dual-layered six-port front-end circuit on the basis of
   substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW) technology is presented and
   demonstrated. The use of SIW technology allows the development of a
   compact circuit with low radiation loss at millimetre-wave frequencies.
   The six-port architecture makes use of multilayer couplers that provide
   a wide coupling area through two slots; a new broadband SIW phase
   shifter composed of two H-plane stub lines and a reference line; and two
   SIW power dividers. The six-port design is free from loads as in the
   case of classic modified six-port architectures with eight ports. To
   validate the proposed concept, an integrated broadband six-port
   front-end circuit prototype was designed, fabricated and measured.
   Simulation and measurement results show that the proposed six-port
   circuit can easily operate at 60 GHz for V-band system applications. The
   two-layered structure presents interesting technological features
   including low profile, small volume and footprint and high-density
   integration.}},

   calculating the fields scattered by an infinite dielectric cylinder

   analytical solution. The effect of the permittivity of the objects on
   choosing the grid period and of applying the equal area rule to
   determine the radius of the wires on the accuracy of the far field
   radiation is investigated. Based on the results on the accuracy of the
   loaded wire grid, a 2D Luneburg lens is implemented. The issues such as
   the losses in the lens, the use of a coarse mesh to reduce the number of
   the wires, the performance of the lens across a frequency bandwidth, and
   the control of the side lobe level and back radiation are studied.}},

Title = {{MRI signal distribution within the intervertebral disc as a biomarker of
   adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and spondylolisthesis}},
Journal = {{BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: Early stages of scoliosis and spondylolisthesis entail
   changes in the intervertebral disc (IVD) structure and biochemistry. The
   current clinical use of MR T2-weighted images is limited to visual
   inspection. Our hypothesis is that the distribution of the MRI signal
   intensity within the IVD in T2-weighted images depends on the spinal
   pathology and on its severity. Therefore, this study aims to develop the
   AMRSID (analysis of MR signal intensity distribution) method to analyze
   the 3D distribution of the MR signal intensity within the IVD and to
   evaluate their sensitivity to scoliosis and spondylolisthesis and their
   severities.
   Methods: This study was realized on 79 adolescents who underwent a MRI
   acquisition (sagittal T2-weighted images) before their orthopedic or
   surgical treatment. Five groups were considered: low severity scoliosis
   (Cobb angle <= 50 degrees), high severity scoliosis (Cobb angles >50
   degrees), low severity spondylolisthesis (Meyerding grades I and II),
   high severity spondylolisthesis (Meyerding grades III, IV and V) and
   control. The distribution of the MRI signal intensity within the IVD was
   analyzed using the descriptive statistics of histograms normalized by
   either cerebrospinal fluid or bone signal intensity, weighted centers
   and volume ratios. Differences between pathology and severity groups
   were assessed using one-and two-way ANOVAs.
   Results: There were significant (p < 0.05) variations of indices between
   scoliosis, spondylolithesis and control groups and between low and high
   severity groups. The cerebrospinal fluid normalization was able to
   detect differences between healthy and pathologic IVDs whereas the bone
   normalization, which reflects both bone and IVD health, detected more
   differences between the severities of these pathologies.
   Conclusions: This study proves for the first time that changes in the
   intervertebral disc, non visible to the naked eye on sagittal
   T2-weighted MR images of the spine, can be detected from specific
   indices describing the distribution of the MR signal intensity.
   Moreover, these indices are able to discriminate between scoliosis and
   spondylolisthesis and their severities, and provide essential
   information on the composition and structure of the discs whatever the
   pathology considered. The AMRSID method may have the potential to
   complement the current diagnostic tools available in clinics to improve
   the diagnostic with earlier biomarkers, the prognosis of evolution and
   the treatment options of scoliosis and spondylolisthesis.}},

Abstract = {{A far-field microwave imaging technique has been developed using a
   spintronic sensor based on a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ). Such a
   sensor can directly rectify a microwave field into a dc voltage signal
   using the Seebeck effect. Thanks to the high conversion efficiency of
   the microwave rectification in MTJs, the microwave power sensitivity of
   the spintronic sensor is on the order of 1-10mV/mW. This high
   sensitivity allows the sensor to directly measure the coherent spatial
   scattered microwave field distribution, which gives it the ability to
   non-destructively detect hidden objects down to a few wavelengths in
   size. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

   interoperability between various components, allow the integration of
   different energy sources, and ease maintenance and upgrading. Hence it
   is capable of handling autonomous energy consumption management for
   systems with heterogeneous dynamics in multiple time-scales and allows
   seamless integration of diverse techniques for online operation control,
   optimal scheduling, and dynamic pricing. The design of a home energy
   manager based on this architecture is illustrated and the simulation
   results with Matlab/Simulink confirm the viability and efficiency of the

Abstract = {{In this letter, a novel broadband magic-T using a stripline embedded
   hybrid substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) structure is proposed. A
   tapered transition is used to transform the TEM mode of the stripline to
   the waveguide modes of the vertically stacked SIWs. Due to the vertical
   symmetry of the structure, the input signal of the stripline can be
   naturally split into two equal and in-phase signals at the output ports
   on the top and bottom layers. An E-plane SIW power divider is utilized
   to realize the E-plane input/output port of the magic-T. Due to the wide
   bandwidth of the stripline-to-SIW transition, a significant bandwidth
   improvement with respect to conventional SIW magic-Ts is achieved.
   Measured results show that, the proposed magic-T has a fractional
   bandwidth of 49.1\% (8.28-13.68 GHz) with return loss better than 15 dB,
   and the amplitude and phase imbalances are less than 0.24 dB and 3

Abstract = {{This paper presents a continuous approximation model to determine the

   activities. The problem is a realistic variant of the vehicle routing
   problem, in which the fleet size and mix are also decision variables.
   The types of vehicles differ in terms of their capacities, fixed costs
   and variable costs. The objective is to minimize the total cost, subject
   to capacity and route duration constraints. We assume customers are
   distributed over a circular service region partitioned into zones, each
   of which is serviced by a single vehicle. The routing costs are assessed
   through a continuous approximation model. We present a mixed integer
   non-linear formulation for the problem, followed by computationally
   efficient upper and lower bounding procedures. The performance of the
   model and of its bounds is assessed on several test instances. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{In an onshore oil field, the productivity of oil wells decreases when
   they require maintenance. To restore full productivity at a well, it
   must be visited by a specially equipped vehicle, called a workover rig.
   Given a set of wells needing maintenance and a heterogeneous fleet of
   workover rigs, the workover rig routing problem (WRRP) consists of
   finding rig routes that minimize the total production loss of the wells
   over a finite horizon. The wells have different loss rates, require
   various services, and may not be serviced within the horizon due to rig
   availability. The rigs have initial positions and do not have the same
   equipment. This paper presents the first exact algorithm for the WRRP,
   namely, a branch-price-and-cut algorithm that relies on some of the most
   recent techniques introduced for the vehicle routing problem with time
   windows. Our computational experiments show that this exact algorithm
   can solve practical-sized instances in reasonable computational times.

Abstract = {{We present a branch-price-and-cut method to solve a maritime pickup and
   delivery problem with time windows and split loads. The fleet of ships
   is heterogeneous and fixed for the planning horizon, and no common depot
   exists. The cargoes picked up and delivered consist of both mandatory
   and optional cargoes, and each cargo may be split among several ships.
   The objective is to design a route for each ship that will maximize the
   total profit from transporting all the mandatory and a subset of the
   optional cargoes. To solve this problem we introduce a new path-flow
   formulation, which we solve by branch-price-and-cut. The subproblem is a
   new variant of the elementary shortest path problem with resource
   constraints, where a multi-dimensional knapsack problem is solved to
   compute optimal cargo quantities. Further, we present new valid
   inequalities for this problem, and adaptations of existing inequalities
   successfully used to solve related problems in the literature. Finally,
   the computational results show that for certain types of instances, our
   solution method outperforms existing methods proposed in the literature.

Abstract = {{This paper overviews the state-of-the-art of substrate integrated
   waveguide (SIW) techniques in the design and realization of innovative
   low-cost, low-profile and low-loss (L3) millimeter-wave antenna
   elements, feeding networks and arrays for various wireless applications.
   Novel classes of multilayered antenna structures and systems are
   proposed and studied to exploit the vertical dimension of planar
   structures to overcome certain limitations in standard two-dimensional
   (2-D) topologies. The developed structures are based on two techniques,
   namely multi-layer stacked structures and E-plane corners. Different
   E-plane structures realized with SIW waveguide are presented, thereby
   demonstrating the potential of the proposed techniques as in
   multi-polarization antenna feeding. An array of 128 elements shows low
   SLL and height gain with just 200 g of the total weight. Two versions of
   2-D scanning multi-beam are presented, which effectively combine
   frequency scanning with beam forming networks. Adding the benefits of
   wide band performance to the multilayer structure, two bi-layer
   structures are investigated. Different stacked antennas and arrays are
   demonstrated to optimize the targeted antenna performances in the
   smallest footprint possible. These structures meet the requirement for
   developing inexpensive compact millimeter-wave antennas and antenna
   systems. Different structures and architectures are theoretically and
   experimentally studied and discussed for specific space- and
   ground-based applications. Practical issues such as high-density
   integration and high-volume manufacturability are also addressed.}},

Abstract = {{A transient model of a water-to-air geothermal heat pump subjected to
   cycling operation is proposed in this paper. A distributed approach is
   used where each component is modeled individually and then linked into a
   so-called global model. The model can predict the state of the
   refrigerant throughout the circuit during normal operation and at
   compressor shut down where there may still be some small refrigerant
   flow. The governing equations of refrigerant and secondary fluid flows,
   along with tube wall temperatures evolutions, are solved using the
   finite volume method. The originality of the proposed model lies in its
   distributed approach which allows to capture both the on-cycle and the
   off-cycle, with fan on or off at compressor shut-down. Results presented
   in a companion paper show that the model is able to predict with
   relatively good agreement the measured transient behavior of a
   geothermal heat pump. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and IIR. All rights

Abstract = {{The experimental validation of a transient geothermal heat pump model is
   presented. A commercial heat pump unit is fully instrumented to measure
   capacity and power usage by the compressor and the fan. On the
   refrigerant side, flow rates, pressures and temperatures are measured at
   various key points to capture the transient behavior under cycling
   conditions. Flow rates and inlet and outlet temperatures of the
   secondary fluids are also measured to check the energy exchanges at the
   evaporator and condenser. An uncertainty analysis shows that it is
   difficult to maintain a small uncertainty in such elaborate experiments.
   Eight cases corresponding to a combination of operating conditions are
   studied. In the four cases in which the unit was running in heating
   mode, it is seen that, contrary to expectations, the pressures equalize
   in the whole refrigeration circuit before the end of the off-cycle.
   Overall, there is a relatively good agreement between the model and the

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{151-158}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{One of the key requirements for the desirable mechanical behavior of
   buckling restrained braces (BRBs) under severe earthquake loading is to
   prevent global buckling until the brace member reaches sufficient
   plastic deformation and ductility. This paper presents finite element
   analysis results of the proposed all-steel buckling restrained braces.
   The proposed BRBs have identical core sections but different buckling
   restraining mechanisms (BRMs). The objective of the analysis is to
   conduct a parametric study of BRBs with different amounts of gap
   (between the core and the BRM) and initial imperfections to investigate
   the global buckling behavior of the brace. The results of the analysis
   showed that BRM flexural stiffness could significantly affect the global
   buckling behavior of a brace, regardless of the size of the gap. In
   addition, a minimum ratio of the Euler buckling load of the restraining
   member to the yield strength of the core, P-e/P-y is suggested for
   design purposes. This ratio is the principal parameter that controls the
   global buckling of BRBs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The global seismic response of 3- and 8-story eccentrically braced
   frames (EBFs), designed for western and eastern North America locations,
   is studied using nonlinear time history analysis. Analytical models were
   built in three computer programs. Similar maximum forces were obtained,
   but the inelastic deformation predictions at the element and global
   structural levels showed sensitivity to the modeling employed. This
   feature should be considered in seismic performance assessment or
   design. Current design methods failed to predict interstory drifts and
   plastic link rotations, but the study confirmed the strong correlation
   between the two parameters associated with rigid-plastic behavior. The
   influence of yielding and flexural buckling of frame members, other than
   the links on the global frame performance, was evaluated using the
   OpenSees model. It was confirmed that the flexural yielding of outer
   beams is acceptable for EBFs with short and intermediate links, if the
   combined flexural strength of the braces and beams is at least equal to
   the expected end-link moments and the braces can resist the associated
   axial force-bending moment demand. Inelastic response of braces and
   columns in such frames did not negatively impact the overall frame
   behavior. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0000433. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{This paper presents shake table test results on two identical 1:0.429
   scaled, 8-story moderately ductile RC shear wall specimens under the
   expected high-frequency ground motion in eastern North America. The
   walls were designed and detailed according to the seismic provisions of
   the NBCC 2005 and CSA-A23.3-04 standards. The objectives were to
   validate and understand the inelastic responses and interaction of shear
   and flexure and axial loads in the plastic hinge zones of the walls
   taking into consideration the higher-mode effects. One specimen was
   tested under incremental ground motion intensities ranging from 40 to
   120\% of the design level. The intensity range was increased from 100 to
   200\% for the second specimen. The response of the walls was
   significantly affected by the second mode, causing an inelastic flexural
   response to develop at the base as well as at the sixth level. Dynamic
   amplification of the base shear forces was also observed in both walls.
   In the second wall, which was tested in the undamaged condition, peak
   base shear forces occurred prior to significant inelastic rotation and
   the contribution to concrete of shear resistance exceeded the value used
   in the design. Once inelastic rotation had developed that contribution
   corresponded to the value obtained using a value of 0.18 for the
   reduction factor accounting for concrete cracking. Inelastic rotation in
   the upper wall region was found to limit the force demand imposed by the
   higher-mode response. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0000581. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Motor-manual brushcutting is commonly used throughout North America for
   regeneration release. Companies pay for this silvicultural treatment
   according to a piece-rate wage system that does not consider stand and
   site characteristics, though both have been shown to affect worker
   productivity. This study aimed to establish a formal regression model
   relating stand and site conditions to brushcutter productivity for
   regeneration release operations. Time studies were conducted in 0.12 ha
   observation areas, with the participation of 91 brushcutters
   representing 22 silvicultural contractors (32 sites). The best fitted
   regression model (theoretical model) to predict effective time
   consumption (ETC) (R-2 = 0.61, RMSE = 4.3 hours per hectare, n = 91)
   contained three independent variables: (1) percent cover (\%) of three
   brush species (raspberry, ferns, fireweed), (2) density of young trees
   higher than 1 m (number per hectare) and (3) density of obstacles
   hindering worker progression in the field (woody residue, stumps left
   after harvest, boulders and terrain roughness). As workers indicated
   that hindering obstacles significantly affected their productivity,
   principal component analysis was used to discriminate between obstacle
   types. Two components representing woody residue and stumps bypassed by
   the worker were significant predictors of ETC (R-2 = 0.14, RMSE = 6.4
   hours per hectare, n = 91). The findings could be useful for piece-rates
   adjustment. Further research is needed to better understand how
   obstacles impact worker productivity.}},

Journal = {{ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{256-262}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{CANDU and similar designs have higher resistance to large-break
   loss-of-coolant accident (LBLOCA). This is due to lower power density of
   the core, its cool, unpressurised moderator, completely separate from
   coolant, etc. A disadvantage, however, is that coolant voiding in any
   pattern, uniform or checkerboard, causes a power pulse in traditional
   core designs moderated and cooled by heavy water. In cores cooled by
   light, moderated by heavy water, such pulse is temporary, disappearing
   passively by itself and restricted to the case of checkerboard voiding.
   A small reactor remodelling is proposed here to ensure no power pulse in
   LBLOCA. Such result has been a historic goal for designers of reactors
   moderated by heavy water. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An optimization problem arising when planning forest harvesting
   operations is the location of new access roads. The new roads must cover
   several areas to be harvested at minimum cost. This problem is of
   economical and environmental relevance in the domain of forestry. In
   this study, the problem is expressed as a P-forest problem in a graph.
   It consists of determining a set of tree structures in a graph that
   covers a set of vertices corresponding to harvest areas. The objective
   is to minimize the sum of construction costs and harvesting costs. In
   addition to the location of roads, the P-forest problem has several
   relevant applications, including public transport, electricity
   transmission, roads, pipelines, and communication networks design. This
   paper presents a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) to
   solve this problem. The heuristic was implemented on a decision support
   system, and computational experiments were conducted on randomly
   generated and real instances to demonstrate the performance and
   practical efficiency of the proposed approach. A comparison with
   manually designed forest road networks in the real instances shows a
   clear advantage for the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Transit operators face a difficult fiscal environment and an imperative
   to contribute to urban sustainability. Under these circumstances,
   operators must find innovative ways to make public transportation
   attractive to broader segments of the public, while simultaneously
   trying to raise revenue to reduce reliance on public subsidies.
   Development of commercial partnerships is seen as a promising way to
   achieve these goals. Previous research has examined the potential of
   using geodemographics to assist transit agencies in the task of
   identifying potential partners for developing mutually beneficial
   commercial agreements. In this paper we describe an approach to model
   isoexposure to transit users as a tool to assess market potential. The
   approach is based on the analysis of walking behavior of transit users,
   and specifically distance walked at the end of their transit trip.
   Spatial modeling is used to geographically project estimates of walking
   distance for a desired demographic profile at a specific transit
   facility. After expanding the estimates using sample weights, overlays
   of these estimates can be used to generate variations in exposure to
   transit travelers at different locations in space. The approach is
   demonstrated using the case of Metro users in Montreal, Canada. The case
   study demonstrates the use of isoexposure profiles as a novel approach
   to generate marketing intelligence. This should be of interest to
   transit agencies and businesses interested in developing partnerships.

Journal = {{CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{27}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: A numerical based brace design platform, including
   biomechanical simulation, Computer Aided Design and Computer Aided
   Manufacturing (CAD/CAM) was developed to rationalize braces for the
   treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. The objective of this
   study was to test the feasibility of the approach and assess the
   effectiveness of braces issued from this platform as compared to
   standard brace design.
   Methods: The biomechanical finite element model was built using the 3D
   reconstruction of the trunk skeleton from bi-planar radiographs and of
   the torso surface from surface topography. The finite element model is
   linked to a CAD/CAM software (Rodin4D), allowing the iterative design
   and simulation of the correction provided by the brace, as well as
   predicting pressures exerted on the torso. The resulting brace design
   was then fabricated using a numerical controlled carver. A brace
   designed using this platform (New Brace) as well as a standard
   thoraco-lumbo-sacral orthosis (Standard Brace) were built for six
   scoliotic patients. Both brace effectiveness was assessed using
   radiographs and compared to the simulations.
   Findings: The New Brace corrected on average the spine deformities
   within 5 of Cobb angle of the simulated correction and with a similar
   correction as compared to the Standard Brace (average correction of 160
   vs. 11 (MT); P=0.1 and 13 degrees vs. 16 degrees (TL/L); P=0.5 for the
   Standard Brace and the New Brace respectively). The two braces had a
   similar 10 degrees lordosing effect of the thoracic curve. The corona]
   balance was quite similar (7.3 vs. 6.8 mm balance improvement
   respectively for New Brace vs. Standard Brace).
   Interpretation: These first clinical results showed the feasibility of
   building computer-assisted braces, equivalent to standard orthosis. An
   extended study on more cases is under way to fully assess this new
   design paradigm, which in the long term would allow improving brace
   design and rationalize the conservative treatments of scoliosis. (C)

Abstract = {{Microorganisms and specifically motile bacteria have been recently added
   to the list of micro-actuators typically considered for the
   implementation of microsystems and microrobots. Such trend has been
   motivated by the fact these microorganisms are self-powered actuators
   with overall sizes at the lower end of the micrometer range and which
   have proven to be extremely effective in low Reynolds number
   hydrodynamic regime of usually less than 10(-2). Furthermore, the
   various sensors or taxes in bacteria influencing their movements can
   also be exploited to perform tasks that were previously considered only
   for futuristic artificial microrobots. Bacterial implementations and
   related issues are not only reviewed, but this paper also proposes many
   techniques and approaches that can be considered as building blocks for
   the implementations of more sophisticated microsystems and microrobots.}},

Abstract = {{A bianisotropic matrix technique is presented for the development of a
   homogenized surface susceptibility model of metasurfaces with arbitrary
   uniaxially mono-anisotropic scatterers, illuminated by obliquely
   incident TE waves. Based on the sole assumption that the scatterers can
   be described by point-dipoles, the proposed formulation establishes a
   simple relation between the homogenized metasurface susceptibility
   matrix and the scatterer polarizability matrix. For this purpose, the
   exact interaction coefficients, associating the metasurface local field
   vectors with the dipole moment vectors, are extracted in terms of
   rapidly convergent series. The resulting analytical expressions for the
   interaction coefficients are applicable to both near-and far-field
   problems. Moreover, the derived formula for the surface susceptibility
   matrix reveals the existence of off-diagonal terms, corresponding to a
   magnetoelectric coupling effect at the lattice level. The accuracy of
   the method is verified via comparisons with full-wave-simulation results
   for several metasurfaces of planar resonators and magnetodielectric
   spheres. It is observed that the efficiency of the model is contingent
   upon the electrical size of the scatterers rather than the lattice
   periodicity, since the former determines the validity of the
   point-dipole approximation, which is the only assumption throughout the
   analysis.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a novel optical microelectromechanical systems
   (MEMS) accelerometer sensor dedicated to space applications. An in-plane
   Fabry-Perot (FP) microcavity (FPM) with two distributed Bragg reflectors
   (DBRs) is used to detect the acceleration. One of the DBR mirrors is
   attached to two suspended proof masses, allowing the FP gap to change
   while proof masses experience acceleration. Acceleration is then
   detected by measuring the spectral shift of the FPM. The optical
   accelerometer presented here uses silicon strip waveguides integrated
   with MEMS on a single silicon-on-insulator wafer, making it compact and
   robust. All of the device components are fabricated using one single
   fabrication step. Immunity to electromagnetic interference, high
   sensitivity and resolution capability, integrability, reliability, low
   cross-sensitivity, simple fabrication, and possibility of having two-and
   three-axis sensitivities are numerous advantages of our sensor compared
   to the conventional ones. The sensor performance demonstrated a 90-nm/g

Abstract = {{This paper aims to advance regional worldwide source receptor
   relationships, providing fate factors for acidifying and eutrophying air
   emissions (NOx, HNO3, SO2, SO4 and NH3) to be used within life cycle
   impact assessment. A simulation for the reference year 2005 of the
   three-dimensional global scale tropospheric GEOS-Chem model was used as
   the basis of a novel methodological approach to derive source receptor
   matrices (SRMs) whose elements are fate factors at a global 2 degrees x
   2.5 degrees grid. This new approach makes it possible to assess the
   impact of transboundary emissions while maintaining regional scale
   emission differentiation. These 2 degrees x 2.5 degrees grid resolution
   fate factors were later aggregated at continental and country
   resolutions using emission weighting. Continental fate factor results
   showed that 50-70\% of nitrogen oxides (NOx, HNO3) and sulfur oxides
   (SO2, SO4) and approximately 80\% of ammonia (NH3) emissions will
   deposit on the same continent. Results showed that the developed fate
   factor derivation approach was within a +/-10\% agreement with GEOS-Chem
   simulations in which fate factors were determined by withdrawing the
   regional emission inventory over Canada and in +/-50\% agreement with
   current state-of-the-art LCIA fate factors (calculated with the European
   Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) model). The SRMs outlined in
   this paper facilitate further modeling developments without having to
   run the underlying tropospheric model, thus opening the door to the
   assessment of the regional life cycle inventories of a global economy.

Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{A novel method, based on the Debye model of the density of the lattice
   vibration energy {[}1,2], is used to predict the thermal conductivity of
   insulator materials from room temperature up to the melting point. The
   model links the density of the lattice vibration energy and the mean
   free path of the phonons to the high temperature limit of the Debye
   temperature, (theta(D)) over bar(infinity), and to the Graneisen
   parameter, gamma(infinity). The phonon contribution to the thermal
   conductivity can be predicted from the knowledge of (theta(D)) over
   bar(infinity) and gamma(infinity). The contribution of the present work
   is a new CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams) Method, based on
   physical models, where the heat capacity, the thermal expansion and the
   adiabatic bulk modulus are optimized simultaneously in order to
   calculate (theta(D)) over bar(infinity) and gamma(infinity). In
   addition, a simple method to predict (theta(D)) over bar(infinity) and
   gamma(infinity), and thus the thermal conductivity without any
   experimental data, is also presented. Results are given for the thermal
   conductivities of some typical insulator materials such as salts
   (halides), oxides and semiconductors. It is found that the agreement
   between the calculations and the available experimental data is
   excellent. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) exploit electrolyte gating
   to achieve the transduction of ionic currents. Therefore, they are
   ideally suitable to sense different chemo/bio species dissolved in the
   electrolyte. Current modulation in OECTs relies on doping or dedoping of
   the OECT channel by electrolyte ions. Nevertheless the role played by
   the specific physicochemical properties of an electrolyte on OECT
   operation is largely unknown. Here we investigate OECTs, making use of
   aqueous solutions of the micelle-forming cationic surfactant
   cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as the electrolyte.
   Micelle-forming salts are remarkable model systems to study the doping
   and dedoping mechanism of OECTs, because the aggregation of dissociated
   ions into micelles at the critical micelle concentration permits to
   modify the size and the type of the species that dope or dedope the OECT
   channel in situ. The current modulation of OECTs using a CTAB
   electrolyte shows a marked increase close to the critical micellar
   concentration. The measurement of the transistor's drain current as a
   function of CTAB concentration provides a simple, fast method to detect
   the formation of micelles from dissociated ions.}},

Abstract = {{Type-2 fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are gaining in popularity because of
   their capacity to handle rule uncertainties in a more complete way.
   Moreover, higher-order interval type-2 (IT2) FLS can reduce drastically
   the number of rules needed to perform the approximation and improve
   transparency and interpretation in many high-dimensional systems. This
   paper presents architecture and inference engine of generalized IT2
   Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) FLS and the design method of higher-order IT2
   FLS. An experimental acoustic emission (AE) signal modeling using a
   second-order IT2 TSK FLS in turning process is given to demonstrate the
   differences between the first-order and second-order IT2 FLSs and the
   advantage and efficiency of high-order IT2 FLS. The estimation of
   uncertainty of AE could be of great value to a decision maker and used
   to investigate tool wear condition during the machining process.}},

   transistor configuration after the characterization of the film forming
   properties by fluorescence hyperspectral imaging and atomic force
   microscopy. We observed a semiconducting behavior for the azomethines
   investigated, being an oligomer thiophene triad, consisting of two
   azomethine bonds, and its polymer counterpart, consisting of about 15
   azomethines bonds. The charge transport properties of an analogous
   thiophene vinylene triad were also examined for validating the mobility
   measurements, because such compounds are known to have hole transport
   properties. The azomethine triad was found to have a hole mobility of 3

Abstract = {{Polyvinylidene fluoride/poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PVDF/PET)-based
   composites for proton exchange membrane fuel cell bipolar plates (BPs)
   were prepared at different crystallization temperatures and
   characterized by X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry,
   and resistivity setup. Composite conductivity was made possible by using
   a mixture of carbon black (CB) and graphite (GR). To improve composite
   processability, its viscosity was reduced by adding a small amount of
   cyclic butylene terephthalate (c-BT) oligomer and thermoplastic
   polyolefin elastomer. In the PVDF/PET-based composite, it was found that
   PVDF phase could crystallize easily but PET crystallization was
   difficult. Because of the CB/GR additives, the formed crystals in
   PVDF/PET phases had a poor perfection degree and showed a lower melting
   temperature when compared with pure PVDF and PET. It was observed that
   PET nucleation was accelerated but not that of PVDF. According to
   through-plane resistivity results, composite crystallization temperature
   range was divided into two parts (below/above 170 degrees C), in which a
   different variation behavior of through-plane resistivity was observed.
   It has been proved that the resistivity was mainly governed by the
   network of CB/GR developed inside the PET phase, and decreasing the
   crystallinity of PET led to a decrease of through-plane resistivity,
   which is desirable for BPs. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 52:2552-2558, 2012. (C)

Abstract = {{A new approach is presented that introduces interparticle forces induced
   by a change of temperature at which polymer coated particles are
   exposed. The particle cohesive flow behavior is shown for two different
   applications. The first one considers a dense granular flow that is
   typically observed for wet powder granulation using a modified
   spheronizer. The other application shows the possibility of mimicking
   the particle flow behavior observed in high-temperature fluidized beds
   with the advantage of being operated at ambient conditions. For the
   first application, as the temperature increases, significant changes in
   the particle bed surface morphology were observed and an important
   reduction of the dynamic density was noticed. For the gassolid
   fluidized-bed application, pressure drop measurements revealed that the
   behavior of the particles transited from Geldart group B to Geldart
   group A and even Geldart group C as the temperature increased. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{This article is about a multi-agent based algorithm for personnel
   scheduling and rescheduling in a dynamic environment of a paced
   multi-product assembly center. The purpose is first to elaborate daily
   employees' assignment to workstations so as to minimize the operational
   costs as well as personnel dissatisfactions; the second is to generate
   an alternative planning when the first solution has to be rescheduled
   due to disturbances related to absenteeism. The proposed approach takes
   into account individual competencies, mobility and preferences of each
   employee, along with the competency requirements associated with each
   assembly activity, with respect to both the current master assembly
   schedule and the line balancing for each product. We use solutions
   obtained through a simulated annealing algorithm in order to benchmark
   the performance of the multi-agent approach. Experimental results show
   that our multi-agent approach can produce high-quality and efficient
   solutions in a short computational time.}},

Abstract = {{Acid mine drainage (AMD) with high iron concentrations can be a major
   challenge for passive treatment systems, particularly when sulphate
   reducing passive bioreactors (SRPBs) are used. The capacity of wood ash
   filters to act as a polishing step after SRPB treatment of a high-iron
   AMD (4,000 mg L-1 of Fe) was assessed. Five columns (1.7 L) with
   different mixtures of wood combustion ash and sand were investigated for
   their potential to remove metals from an SRPB effluent over 122 days.
   These materials had a high specific surface area (between 46 and 159
   mA(2)A g(-1)), high organic carbon contents (between 12 and 32 \%), and
   a high paste pH (up to 12.2). The Freundlich isotherm model reflects the
   observed iron sorption behavior on the material surface. Column study
   results indicate that the wood ash decreased iron concentrations for
   more than 100 days below 10 mg L-1 (99 \% iron removal), mainly due to
   iron hydroxide precipitation and sorption. The risk of system clogging
   was negligible since the saturated hydraulic conductivity remained
   stable, between 5.0 x 10(-3) and 3.1 x 10(-2) cm s(-1). Between 44 and
   52 \% of the sulphate was also removed due to gypsum precipitation.}},

   and showed that only small instances of this global planning problem can
   be solved to optimality by a commercial MIP solver within a reasonable
   amount of time (St-Hilaire, Chamberland, \& Pierre, 2006). Heuristic
   methods are needed for larger instances. This paper provides the first
   complete formulation for the heuristic sequential method (St-Hilaire,
   Chamberland, \& Pierre, 2006) that re-partitions the global formulation
   into the three conventional subproblems and solves them in sequence
   using a MIP solver. This greatly improves the solution time, but at the
   expense of solution quality. We also develop a new hybrid heuristic that
   uses the results of the sequential method to generate constraints that
   provide tighter bounds for the global planning problem with the goal of
   reaching the provable optimum solution much more quickly. We empirically
   evaluate the speed and solution accuracy of four solution methods: (i)
   the direct MIP solution of the global planning problem, (ii) a local
   search heuristic applied to the global planning problem, (iii) the
   sequential method and (iv) the new hybrid method. The results show that
   the sequential method provides very good results in a fraction of the
   time needed for the direct MIP solution of the global problem, and that
   optimum results can be provided by the hybrid heuristic in greatly
   reduced time. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The multi-activity assignment problem consists of assigning
   interruptible activities to given work shifts so as to match as much as
   possible for each activity a demand curve in function of time. In this
   paper we consider an extension to this problem, called the
   multi-activity and task assignment problem, that additionally considers
   the assignment of uninterruptible pieces of work, called tasks. These
   possess properties such as worker qualifications, time windows for
   completion, fixed lengths and precedence relationships. We propose a
   mixed-integer programming formulation and a two-stage method to solve
   this problem. The first stage consists of an approximation mixed-integer
   programming model to assign tasks approximately taking into account the
   activities and the second involves a column generation heuristic for
   assigning activities and reassigning tasks at the same time. We suggest
   four different strategies for reassigning tasks. We conducted extensive
   computational tests on randomly generated instances in order to validate
   our method and to compare the various strategies. One strategy proved
   universally best when compared to the other three policies. (C) 2012

Journal = {{CLIMATIC CHANGE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{115}},

Abstract = {{In order to properly assess the climate impact of temporary carbon
   sequestration and storage projects through land-use, land-use change and
   forestry (LULUCF), it is important to consider their temporal aspect.
   Dynamic life cycle assessment (dynamic LCA) was developed to account for
   time while assessing the potential impact of life cycle greenhouse gases
   (GHG) emissions. In this paper, the dynamic LCA approach is applied to a
   temporary carbon sequestration project through afforestation, and the
   results are compared with those of the two principal ton-year
   approaches: the Moura-Costa and the Lashof methods. The dynamic LCA
   covers different scenarios, which are distinguished by the assumptions
   regarding what happens at the end of the sequestration period. In order
   to ascertain the degree of compensation of an emission through a LULUCF
   project, the ratio of the cumulative impact of the project to the
   cumulative impact of a baseline GHG emission is calculated over time.
   This ratio tends to 1 when assuming that, after the end of the
   sequestration project period, the forest is maintained indefinitely.
   Conversely, the ratio tends to much lower values in scenarios where part
   of the carbon is released back to the atmosphere due to e.g. fire or
   forest exploitation. The comparison of dynamic LCA with the ton-year
   approaches shows that it is a more flexible approach as it allows the
   consideration of every life cycle stage of the project and it gives
   decision makers the opportunity to test the sensitivity of the results
   to the choice of different time horizons.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to functionalize cotton gauzes with

   according to a two-steps approach: (1) pre-irradiation of the gauzes
   (Gammabeam) to graft glycidyl methacrylate (GMA), and (2) covalent
   binding of cyclodextrins (CDs) to the GMA-grafted gauzes. First the
   dependence of GMA grafting yield on the radiation dose (from 1 to 20
   kGy) and the time of reaction was evaluated in detail. Anchorage of
   beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) and hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin
   (HP-beta-CD) was confirmed by FTIR, TGA, and 3-methylbenzoic acid
   sorption. Differently from pristine gauzes, CD-functionalized
   GMA-grafted gauzes were able to load an anionic antibiotic drug,
   specifically nalidixic acid, and to sustain the release for 6 h.
   Drug-loaded gauzes were tested in vitro against E. coli and the results
   prove the suitability of the functionalization approach to efficiently
   inhibit the growth of this microorganism.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a dynamic vulcanized alloy of brominated
   poly(isobutylene-co-p-methylstyrene) (BIMSM) and polyamide (PA) has been
   investigated. An interfacial reaction between BIMSM and PA and a
   crosslinking reaction between BIMSM molecules is carried out
   simultaneously during melt blending. To form a vulcanized, nanoscale
   elastomer dispersion, the timing of these reactions is key and the
   interfacial reaction should be well advanced before the vulcanization
   reaction initiates. At a blending temperature of 205 degrees C,
   independent of the processing conditions, it is found that the
   interfacial reaction dominates the phase morphology development.
   Increasing the melt processing temperature, however, begins to favor the
   vulcanization reaction over the interfacial reaction. In nonplasticized
   blends, it is found that increasing the temperature above 235 degrees C
   increases the speed of the vulcanization reaction to a level that it
   dominates the phase morphology development. As a result, the phase size
   increases by 2.5-fold because the system is vulcanized before the
   interfacial modification step is complete. Adding plasticizer to the PA
   matrix increases the overall phase size, but shows a similar behavior
   with increase in temperature from 205 to 255 degrees C. The critical
   temperature where the vulcanization reaction starts dominating phase
   morphology in the plasticized systems is at 225 degrees C. Once the
   processing temperature is above the critical temperature, it is found
   that the mixing sequence can be used to time and decouple the reactions.
   The work demonstrates that a close control over the temperature and
   processing conditions can be used to decouple the interfacial and
   vulcanization reactions resulting in vulcanized, nanoscale dispersions
   for the BIMSM and PA system. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Polym

Title = {{Statistical estimation of missing data in life cycle inventory: an
   application to hydroelectric power plants}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{In evaluating the impacts of products and processes, life cycle
   assessment has taken a prominent role. Missing data, however, continue
   to affect the completeness and accuracy of such environmental assessment
   tools. Data are missing for many reasons, for specific processes, at
   random in existing inventories or worse, nonexistent. This article
   proposes a statistical approach to address the lack of data in life
   cycle inventories and applies it to hydroelectric power plants. Among
   large power production technologies, hydroelectricity varies
   considerably in scale and from one site to another. The procedure relies
   on relationships between the technical properties of a system or
   process, in this case hydropower plants, and the embodied material and
   energy flows in construction, operation and eventually dismantling. With
   highly flexible estimators known as kriging, predicting the value of
   material and energy flows becomes more accurate. From relatively small
   sample sizes, kriging allows better estimation without averaging out any
   of the observed data. Similarly, parameter estimation and model
   validation can be performed through cross validation which assumes very
   little on the data itself. Calculations of mean absolute errors for
   various forms of kriging and regression show that the former estimates
   the values of material and energy flows more accurately than the latter,
   more so in cases of incomplete data. Accounting for several technical
   characteristics as well as joint estimation of covariate material and
   energy flows provide different ways to further reduce the errors and
   improve the completeness of inventories where data are missing. The
   specificity of hydroelectric power makes existing inventory data largely
   unrepresentative and kriging offers new possibilities to increase the
   reliability of estimated, representative data. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Space medicine innovation and telehealth concept implementation for
   medical care during exploration-class missions}},
Journal = {{ACTA ASTRONAUTICA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{30-33}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Medical care on the International Space Station (ISS) is provided using
   real-time communication with limited medical data transmission. In the
   occurrence of an off-nominal medical event, the medical care paradigm
   employed is `stabilization and transportation', involving real-time
   management from ground and immediate return to Earth in the event that
   the medical contingency could not be resolved in due time in space. In
   preparation for future missions beyond Low-Earth orbit (LEO), medical
   concepts of operations are being developed to ensure adequate support
   for the new mission profiles: increased distance, duration and
   communication delays, as well as impossibility of emergency returns and
   limitations in terms of medical equipment availability. The current ISS
   paradigm of medical care would no longer be adequate due to these new
   constraints. The Operational Space Medicine group at the Canadian Space
   Agency (CSA) is looking towards synergies between terrestrial and space
   medicine concepts for the delivery of medical care to deal with the new
   challenges of human space exploration as well as to provide benefits to
   the Canadian population. Remote and rural communities on Earth are, in
   fact, facing similar problems such as isolation, remoteness to tertiary
   care centers, resource scarcity, difficult (and expensive) emergency
   transfers, limited access to physicians and specialists and limited
   training of medical and nursing staff, There are a number of researchers
   and organizations, outside the space communities, working in the area of
   telehealth. They are designing and implementing terrestrial telehealth
   programs using real-time and store-and-forward techniques to provide
   isolated populations access to medical care. The cross-fertilization of
   space-Earth research could provide support for increased spin-off and
   spin-in effects and stimulate telehealth and space medicine innovations
   to engage in the new era of human space exploration. This paper will
   discuss the benefits of space-Earth research projects for the
   advancement of both terrestrial and space medicine and will use examples
   of operational space medicine projects conducted at the CSA in areas
   such as remote training, tele-mentoring and remote control of an
   ultrasound. Crown Copyright (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Reactive transport modelling of acid mine drainage within discretely
   fractured porous media: Plume evolution from a surface source zone}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{38}},
Pages = {{259-270}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A numerical model is developed for investigating the transport behaviour
   and geochemical evolution of acidic mine drainage (AMD) in discretely
   fractured porous media. The simulation approach is tested using a
   conceptual model of a reactive mine waste system in which an active
   source of AMD overlies a fractured silicate-rich porous host rock with a
   low but non-zero matrix permeability. Source composition is based on
   measured data from an existing mine tailings site. The numerical model
   includes groundwater flow, AMD infiltration, multi-component
   advective-dispersive transport, equilibrium geochemical speciation and
   water-rock pH-buffering reactions within a discrete fracture network
   (DFN). An analytical solution for parallel-fractures is used to verify
   the model, which is then applied to simulate the evolution of pH, the
   major aqueous species from the AMD source, as well as selected mineral
   buffers. As the acidic drainage water infiltrates into the initially
   uncontaminated fracture networks, high concentration gradients develop
   within the matrix along fracture interfaces inducing diffusion-limited
   pH buffering and precipitation of secondary minerals within the rock
   matrix. A comparison of AMD evolution in three fracture networks shows
   that even within a densely fractured network. AMD plume evolution can be
   significantly different from that obtained from assuming an equivalent
   porous medium (EPM). The paper also addresses issues of time scales and
   matrix diffusion. The results have implications for predicting
   environmental impacts of acid mine drainage in complex mining
   environments and for coupling of hydro-geochemical and geotechnical
   models. The model can also be applied to other hydrogeological systems
   including fractured clays and tills, to other contaminants including
   hydrocarbons or organic solvents, and to simulate geochemical evolution
   in natural flow systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic constraint aggregation (DCA) and dual variable stabilization
   (DVS) are two methods that can reduce the negative impact of degeneracy
   when solving linear programs. The first uses a projection to reduce the

   we develop a new method, called stabilized dynamic constraint
   aggregation (SDCA), that combines DCA and DVS for solving set
   partitioning problems. It allows to fight degeneracy from both primal
   and dual perspectives simultaneously. To assess the effectiveness of
   SDCA, we report computational results obtained for highly degenerate
   multi-depot vehicle scheduling problem instances solved by column
   generation. These results indicate that SDCA can reduce the average
   computational time of the master problem by a factor of up to 7 with
   respect to the best of the two combined methods. Furthermore, they show
   that its performance is robust with regard to increasing levels of
   degeneracy in test problems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive approach to the real-time simulation of power converters
   using a state-space representation is covered in this paper. Systematic
   formulations of state-space equations as well as a new switch model are
   presented. The proposed switch model exhibits a natural switching

   simulation of power converters, thereby allowing individual treatment of
   switching devices irrespective of the converter topology. Successful
   implementations of the proposed switch model on a field programmable
   gate array (FPGA) device are reported, with two alternative approaches:
   1) precomputing network equations for all switch state combinations and
   2) solving network equations on-chip using the Gauss-Seidel iterative
   method. A two-level three-phase voltage source converter is implemented
   using the first approach, with a time step of 80 ns and a switching
   frequency of 200 kHz. Ideal and nonideal boost converters are also
   implemented on FPGA using the second approach, with a time step of 75 ns
   and a switching frequency of 20 kHz. Comparison with SPICE models shows
   that the proposed switch model offers very satisfactory accuracy and

Abstract = {{We consider an inventory routing problem in discrete time where a

   level of the inventory at the customers and at the supplier. The
   objective is the minimization of the sum of the inventory and

Volume = {{472}},
Pages = {{238-253}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Interpolation of solute concentration measurements often yields
   disappointing results, especially when it fails to incorporate some
   knowledge relative to the underlying physics of groundwater flow and
   solute transport. Concentration maps, however, are required in several
   applications such as plume monitoring, evaluation of total dissolved
   mass, design of hydraulic containment and pump-and-treat systems, source
   identification and natural attenuation assessment. Kriged concentration
   maps can be improved by a coordinate transformation based on natural
   flow coordinates, as this allows to consider variations in the local
   anisotropy direction produced by heterogeneous groundwater flow. On the
   other hand, this does not consider nonstationarity induced by local
   dispersion. This paper presents a flexible kriging approach that
   combines a coordinate transformation based on groundwater flow and a
   class of nonstationary (NS) covariance functions that can be
   parameterized to account for the evolution of concentration correlation
   and variance with travel time/distance. We also propose an alternative
   flow coordinate transformation that does not rely on the stream
   function, enabling the computation of approximate 3-D flow coordinates.
   Nonstationary covariance parameters are estimated using maximum
   likelihood, and candidate parametrizations are compared by the
   likelihood ratio test and Akaike Information Criterion. The approach is
   tested on simple 2-D and 3-D synthetic plumes shaped by heterogeneous
   flow and local dispersion Results show that: (1) NS covariance
   parameterizations improve significantly the likelihood compared to the
   stationary models, (2) the combined coordinate transformation and NS
   covariance approach enhances kriging of solute concentrations. Although
   the flow fields are considered known in the case studies, the approach
   can be modified to incorporate flow uncertainty and lends itself to
   various useful extensions, such as mass flux estimation. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{In vivo estimations of Pb particle bioavailability are costly and
   variable, because of the nature of animal assays. The most feasible
   alternative for increasing the number of investigations carried out on
   Pb particle bioavailability is in vitro testing. This testing method
   requires calibration using in vivo data on an adapted animal model, so
   that the results will be valid for childhood exposure assessment. Also,
   the test results must be reproducible within and between laboratories.
   The Relative Bioaccessibility Leaching Procedure, which is calibrated
   with in vivo data on soils, presents the highest degree of validation
   and simplicity. This method could be applied to Pb particles, including
   those in paint and dust, and those in drinking water systems, which
   although relevant, have been poorly investigated up to now for childhood
   exposure assessment.}},

   utilizing detuning of the pump wavelength within the SHG bandwidth. The
   temperature-assisted tuning of QPM pump wavelengths allows shifting the

   results indicate that an overall idler wavelength shift of less than 10
   nm realized by selecting pump wavelengths via temperature tuning, is
   sufficient to cover up to 40 WDM channels for multiple idlers

Title = {{Using a novel sol-gel stir bar sorptive extraction method for the
   analysis of steroid hormones in water by laser diode thermal
   desorption/atmospheric chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry}},
Journal = {{TALANTA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{101}},

Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{A new coating material was used for a stir bar sorptive extraction
   (SBSE) method coupled to a high throughput sample analysis technique.
   This allowed for a simple procedure for fast determinations of eight
   steroid hormones (estriol, estradiol, ethynylestradiol, estrone,
   progesterone, medroxyprogesterone, levonorgestrel, northindrone) in
   water. Sample pre-treatment was performed using an in-house SBSE method
   based on a
   polydimethylsiloxane/phenyltrimethylsiloxane/beta-cyclodextrin sol-gel
   material. The analytes were desorbed by liquid extraction prior to their
   analysis by laser diode thermal desorption/atmospheric pressure chemical
   ionization coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LDTD-APCI-MS/MS).
   Several parameters, including ionic strength, volume and time of
   extraction as well as volume and time of desorption, were investigated
   to maximize extraction efficiency by SBSE in aqueous solutions. The
   in-house stir bar showed good reproducibility and could be used for at
   least 50 extractions without affecting analytical performance. The
   recoveries of the spiked steroid hormones ranged from 55\% to 96\% in
   all water matrices studied (HPLC grade water, tap water and raw
   wastewater). Only one compound showed poor recovery values (<2\% for
   estriol) in all matrices. The method detection limits (MDLs) in real
   matrices were within the range of 0.1-03 mu g L-1 except for estriol at
   48 mu g L-1. The extraction performance of the in-house SBSE for the
   eight selected hormones was also compared with that of a
   commercially-available stir bar coated with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS).
   This novel stir bar coating could prove to be useful method for the
   detection and quantification of trace levels of steroid hormones. (C)

Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of mammalian cells are largely determined by
   their cytoskeletons (CSKs), which comprise several distinct but
   interacting cytoplasmic molecular networks. To examine the influence of
   the CSK on cell mechanical properties, we deformed several mammalian
   cell-types (L929, CHO, HEK293, and U937) in suspension using
   time-varying non-uniform electric fields. Confocal fluorescent
   microscopy was also used to visualize and semi-quantitatively analyze
   CSK dimensions. We found mechanical properties of individually deformed
   cells to depend on cortical actin (CA) thickness. U937 and HEK293 cells
   with thin CA were more easily deformed than CHO and L929 cells, which
   bore thicker CA. In additional experiments, we treated U937 cells with
   latrunculin-A (Lat-A) and acrylamide (ACR), drugs that disrupt
   microfilaments (MF) and intermediate-filaments (IF), respectively, in
   order to assess their effects on the CSK and on the cell mechanical
   properties. We fit strain data using either a power-law or a
   viscoelasticity model of compliance. Our results demonstrated that
   maximal strain values observed under identical loading conditions were
   determined by the structural integrity and thickness of CA in suspended
   cells. Young's modulus values of individually deformed cells that were
   estimated using a power-law model showed a linear dependence on cortical
   actin thickness. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{SPINE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{E1479-E1487}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Study Design. Computer modeling and simulations to analyze correction
   forces at the bone-screw interface in scoliosis instrumentation.
   Objective. To derive the minimum corrective forces applied on vertebrae
   through pedicle screws to achieve desired scoliosis corrections and
   evaluate the actual bone-screw forces associated with 3 types of pedicle
   screws (monoaxial, polyaxial, and dorsoaxial).
   Summary of Background Data. The optimum screw pattern has not been
   established in the literature. The final bone-screw forces in scoliosis
   instrumentation consist of ``true corrective forces{''} (i.e., the
   minimum forces required to achieve the desired corrections without
   considering adequate rod seating at all pedicle screws) and ``extra
   forces{''} (EF) (i.e., supplementary forces applied to ensure proper rod
   seating when the attachment of some screws is not in compliance with the
   attachment of their neighboring screws; they have no benefit to overall
   corrections).
   Methods. Using patient-specific computer models, true corrective forces
   were estimated for 10 spinal instrumentation cases. EF were computed by
   simulating the instrumentations of the 10 cases using respectively
   monoaxial, polyaxial, and dorsoaxial screws.
   Results. The average true corrective forces were 50 +/- 30 N. The
   average bone-screw forces were 229 +/- 140 N, 141 +/- 99 N, and 103 42
   N, respectively, for monoaxial, polyaxial, and dorsoaxial screws; the
   averages of the EF magnitudes were 205 136 N, 125 +/- 93 N, and 65 +/-
   39 N, respectively.
   Conclusion. Bone-screw forces to achieve desired corrections can be
   minimized. However, EF are inevitable to secure the locking of all
   screws. Higher EF were associated with pedicle screws, with less degrees
   of freedom for connecting screw body to rod, that is, monoaxial followed
   by polyaxial and then by dorsoaxial screws.}},

Abstract = {{This study proposes an enhanced version of the five-field motion
   compensated deinterlacing algorithm. The proposed method applies
   bi-directional motion estimation using two previous and two subsequent
   fields. It uses an array of flags to determine if the missing pixels of
   two previous frames are calculated from original pixels or pre-filtered
   data. If the pixels are calculated from pre-filtered data, they are not
   used for deinterlacing in order to decrease error propagation. A new
   method is also proposed to recognise the presence of fast and
   non-uniform motions and to prevent the artefacts they can cause. The
   method calculates two motion vectors within the same parity fields and
   checks their directions to determine whether they are associated with a
   uniform motion or not. Motion compensation is refined in a way that
   pre-filtered data of subsequent fields are never used for missing line
   calculation. Experimental results based on objective and subjective
   criteria show that the proposed algorithm improves vertical resolution,
   prevents artefacts caused by fast and non-uniform motions and achieves
   better overall image quality than previously reported methods.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, asymmetric non-pipelined large size unsigned and signed
   multipliers are implemented using symmetric and asymmetric embedded
   multipliers, look-up tables and dedicated adders in field programmable
   gate arrays (FPGAs). Decompositions of the operands are performed for
   the efficient use of the embedded blocks. Partial products are organised
   in various configurations, and the additions of the products are
   realised in an optimised manner. The additions used in the
   implementation of the multiplication include compressor-based,
   Delay-Table and Ternary-adder-based approaches. These approaches have
   led to the minimisation of the total critical path delay with reduced
   utilisation of FPGA resources. The asymmetric multipliers were
   implemented in Xilinx FPGAs using 18 x 18-bit and 25 x 18-bit embedded
   signed multipliers. Implementation results demonstrate an improvement of
   up to 32\% in delay and up to 37\% in the number of embedded blocks
   compared with the performance of designs generated by commercial
   synthesis tools.}},

Abstract = {{A methodology for early design-stage evaluation of biorefinery processes
   that uses multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) panels was developed with
   the goal of screening out less promising options. Panel members were
   asked to rate the relative importance of a set of evaluation criteria
   for biorefinery process implementation at a pulp and paper mill. Three
   different panels were conducted, each with this same objective. This
   report compares and assesses the results from the panels. Two of the
   MCDM panels were comprised of biorefinery specialists of similar
   backgrounds from government and academia, and the third panel consisted
   of pulp and paper industry decision makers. In general, consensus was
   high between all three panels, and especially between the two
   biorefinery specialist panels; however, certain differences were noted
   with the industry panel. For three out of eight criteria, these
   differences were attributable to a difference in the perspective of the
   forest industry decision makers and biorefinery specialists. For
   example, for the return on investment criteria, the specialist panels
   gave a significantly higher importance to current information from
   technology suppliers because it provides an important short-term
   perspective. In contrast, the forest industry decision makers thought
   that information about a particular technology should be critiqued and
   adjusted based on a systematic assessment of likely future process
   performance. Differences between the other criteria were attributed to
   differing interpretations of the criteria.}},

Abstract = {{A new experimental method for the incorporation of residual stresses
   (RS) in standard fatigue steels specimens was developed. RS were
   introduced by means of high frequency (360 kHz) induction heating.
   Surface tensile RS resulted from cooling down the specimen subjected to
   a high thermal gradient. To preserve the mechanical properties of the
   steel, it was necessary to circulate a coolant at the center of the
   specimen. The 304L austenitic stainless steel does not undergo phase
   transformation nor micro structural changes in the solid state and was
   thus selected for this purpose. Multiphysics finite element (FE)
   analysis was used to calculate the distributed RS in the fatigue
   samples. These calculations were compared to XRD measurements and a very
   good agreement was obtained. It was therefore demonstrated that RS
   induced with induction heating could be numerically assessed. This
   conditioning method was then proved efficient to study the only
   influence of a predetermined amount of RS on the fatigue properties of
   austenitic 304L steel without undergoing influences of other parameters
   such as microstructure, surface finish and geometry. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{Full three dimensional x-ray diffraction reciprocal space maps combined
   with transmission electron microscopy measurements provide a systematic
   determination of the texture of GaP epilayers containing embedded MnP
   nanoclusters grown on GaP(001) by organometallic vapor phase epitaxy.
   This approach reveals that the texture of the MnP clusters depends on
   the growth surface morphology and bonding configuration and on the
   lattice mismatch at the cluster/matrix interfaces during growth. It
   demonstrates that the orthorhombic MnP nanoclusters are oriented along
   specific GaP crystallographic directions, forming six well defined
   families, whose population is influenced by the growth temperature and
   the film thickness. The clusters principally grow on GaP(001) and
   GaP\{111\} facets with a small fraction of clusters nucleating on
   higher-index GaP\{hhl\} facets. Most epitaxial alignments share a
   similar component: the MnP(001) plane (c-axis plane) is parallel to the
   GaP\{110\} plane family. Axiotaxial ordering between the MnP clusters
   and the GaP matrix is also observed. Furthermore, with this systematic
   approach, all phases present in these heterogeneous films can be
   identified. In particular, traces of hexagonal Mn2P precipitates have
   been observed while their formation can be avoided by lowering the
   growth temperature. Comparing the structural results presented here with
   magnetic measurement carried out on similar samples confirms that the
   effective magnetic properties of the heterogeneous layer can be tuned by
   controlling the texture of the ferromagnetic nanoclusters. (C) 2012

   new adaptive method (called the adaptive discrepancy search), intended
   for search in nonbinary trees, and that is exploitable in a distributed
   optimization context. For the industrial case studied (a supply chain in
   the forest products industry), this allowed reducing nearly half the
   time needed to obtain the best solution in comparison with a standard
   nonadaptive method. The method has also been evaluated for use with
   synthesized problems in order to validate the results that are obtained

Abstract = {{Several concrete hydraulic structures, such as spillway piers, must be
   considered three-dimensional (3D) components subjected to 3D loads. A
   very convenient approach to perform stability analysis of concrete dams
   is the so-called gravity method, leading to the solution of a PMM
   problem (axial force P and biaxial bending moments M-x, M-y) assuming
   linear normal stress distribution. If cracking takes place, water
   penetrates into the cracks, inducing the development of full uplift
   pressures (UPs). Sliding safety factors (SSFs) are computed using shear
   force resultants V-x, V-y, and a Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion while
   ignoring torsion T (VVT). This paper presents a 3D extension of the
   gravity method for cracked planar concrete sections of arbitrary
   geometry subjected to arbitrary loads (PMM-VVT). To compute the shear
   stress distribution, a VVT sectional analysis algorithm has been
   developed based on the theory of elasticity (TE), including Saint-Venant
   and warping torsional components combined with triangular 2D finite
   elements (FEs). Afterward, the SSF on the failure plane is computed from
   the integration of normal stresses on the remaining uncracked area where
   the Mohr-Coulomb criterion (considering the shear stresses from the VVT
   solution) has not been locally exceeded. Two validation examples and a
   case study of an actual pier are presented to illustrate the accuracy
   and efficiency of the proposed approach compared with full 3D FE
   analyses. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0000579. (C) 2012 American

   applications in orthopedic and cardiovascular medicine: we discuss the
   influence of surface properties on the observed behaviors of two
   particular cell lines, human U937 monocytes, and Chinese hamster ovary
   cells. Particular emphasis is placed on possible electrostatic

Abstract = {{As the forest products industry evolves into a modern industry based on
   cutting-edge industrial and management research, the prevalence and
   importance of university research centres have gained importance.
   Although there has been increased funding and attention given to
   university-industry research centres from policy makers and researchers,
   little is still known about the benefits or value that these
   collaborations provide and create for firms. Applied academic research
   requires the active participation of researchers and practitioners. In
   the Canadian forest products industry, there are other important actors
   that need to be considered, the federal and provincial governments as
   owners and regulators of the resource and funders of research and
   development projects and intermediary organisations who are often
   charged with transforming academic results into tools and methods able
   to be implemented into industry firms. This paper presents the results
   of three comparative case studies of university-industry research
   centres operating in the Canadian forest products industry through an
   exploration of their knowledge and technology transfer processes. The
   goal is to better understand the value that has been created for the
   four main groups of actors involved though informal and formal transfer
   processes and which processes are best suited for different types of
   knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{We study large population leader-follower stochastic multi-agent systems
   where the agents have linear stochastic dynamics and are coupled via
   their quadratic cost functions. The cost of each leader is based on a
   trade-off between moving toward a certain reference trajectory which is
   unknown to the followers and staying near their own centroid. On the
   other hand, followers react by tracking a convex combination of their
   own centroid and the centroid of the leaders. We approach this large
   population dynamic game problem by use of so-called Mean Field (MF)
   linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) stochastic control theory. In this
   model, followers are adaptive in the sense that they use a likelihood
   ratio estimator (on a sample population of the leaders' trajectories) to
   identify the member of a given finite class of models which is
   generating the reference trajectory of the leaders. Under appropriate
   conditions, it is shown that the true reference trajectory model is
   identified by each follower in finite time with probability one as the
   leaders' population goes to infinity. Furthermore, we show that the
   resulting sets of mean field control laws for both leaders and adaptive
   followers possess an almost sure epsilon(N)-Nash equilibrium property
   for a system with population where epsilon(N) goes to zero as goes to
   infinity. Numerical experiments are presented illustrating the results.}},

Title = {{Measuring accessibility: positive and normative implementations of
   various accessibility indicators}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{25}},
Pages = {{141-153}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Accessibility is a concept of continuing relevance in transportation
   research. A number of different measures of accessibility, defined as
   the potential to reach spatially dispersed opportunities, have been
   proposed in the literature, and used to address various substantive
   planning and policy questions. Our objective in this paper is to conduct
   a review of various commonly used measures of accessibility, with a
   particular view to clarifying their normative (i.e. prescriptive), as
   well as positive (i.e. descriptive) aspects. This is a distinction that
   has seldom been made in the literature and that helps to better
   understand the meaning of alternative ways to implement the concept of
   accessibility. Our discussion of the positive and normative aspects of
   accessibility measurements is illustrated using the city of Montreal,
   Canada, as a case study. The example highlights the differences in the
   measured levels of accessibility depending on implementation. Comparison
   of the two by means of a relative indicator of accessibility helps to
   identify the gap between desired (as normative defined) and actual (as
   revealed) accessibility levels. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A permeability test in a monitoring well (MW) is used to assess the
   hydraulic conductivity, k, of clay. To interpret the test data, the
   piezometric level (PL) during the test must be known. A previous paper
   has concluded that due to a long time lag, the water level in the pipe
   is never a PL and any extrapolation of water level versus time gives an
   unreliable prediction of the PL. As a result, an incorrect PL yields an
   incorrect k value. This paper shows that a variable-head permeability
   test can provide a fair estimate of both the PL and the k value when it
   is interpreted using the central portion of the velocity graph. The
   first portion of the graph, when the head difference and the gradients
   are high, is curved by the expansion of the injection zone (undrained
   and drained wall displacement with eventually some creep), and thus
   cannot be used. The last portion of the graph primarily reflects, with
   some time lag, the natural variations of hydraulic heads in adjacent
   aquifers, and thus must not be used.}},

Abstract = {{A multifunctional polymeric chain extender (Joncryl) was used in the
   melt processing of a neat polylactide and polylactide/clay
   nanocomposites. The effects of Joncryl on morphology, rheology, thermal
   and mechanical properties, barrier properties and biodegradability were
   investigated. Three Joncryl loadings (0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 wt\%) were used
   in this study, and the 0.5 wt\% loading induced a long-chain branched
   structure in the PLA matrix, as indicated by the melt rheology results.
   It is believed that the property variations are all related to the
   long-chain branched structure as well as on the molecular weight
   recovery. The use of Joncryl did not change the intercalated and
   partially exfoliated clay structures in the PLA/clay nanocomposites, as
   observed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM). The tensile modulus and maximum strength slightly increased with
   Joncryl loading. The oxygen barrier properties were also improved by
   adding Joncryl. However, the addition of Joncryl prevented the formation
   of large spherulitic crystals and decreased the creep resistance at low
   stress level. Joncryl could not only control the thermal degradation of
   PLA during processing, but also affected its biodegradation in compost:
   higher Joncryl loading led to slower biodegradation and less molecular
   weight reduction with time.}},

Abstract = {{Multilayer films consisting of a core layer of nylon 6 (PA6) sandwiched
   between two linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) layers by using a
   tie layer were produced using a semi industrial cast film extrusion
   line. The core layer of the films was produced from neat PA6 and
   PA6/clay nanocomposite resins. The films were consequently uniaxially
   stretched in machine direction. The effect of stretching on crystalline
   structure, orientation as well as mechanical and barrier properties of
   the samples were investigated. Orientation of the films for both layers:
   polyethylene and nylon was assessed using FTIR (Fourier Transform
   Infrared Spectroscopy) and it was found that clay inclusion hindered
   orientation of the core nylon layer. Interaction of nylon molecules with
   clay influences the crystalline structure for nylon/clay nanocomposite
   film during the stretching as it hindered crystal transformation of
   gamma to alpha phase. The effect of clay interaction on phase structure
   was also observed in DSC (Dynamic Scanning Calorimetry) results.
   Stretching improved barrier to oxygen for the samples. Oxygen
   transmission rate was reduced about 62.5\% for the films having a nylon
   core and 50\% for those with nylon/clay core when stretched to a draw
   ratio of 1.5 and remained nearly constant for higher draw ratios up to
   3. Haze of the films was reduced with stretching; however the effect was
   more effective for the sample with neat nylon in the core layer when
   compared to the nylon/clay core one. Finally, it was observed that
   puncture resistance of the samples was improved significantly with
   stretching.}},

Title = {{Analytical solution for a vibrating simply-supported cylinder subjected

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{35}},
Pages = {{1-20}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{An analytical model of annular-flow-induced vibration of a pinned-pinned
   cylinder is proposed. The model is based on three main assumptions: (i)
   small perturbations in flow components, (ii) negligible radial flow to
   reduce the annular flow to two-dimensional flow, and axial flow only for
   reduction to a one-dimensional flow, and (iii) perturbation frictional
   loss depending on the variation of axial perturbation velocity in terms
   of space and time. In this study, it is concluded that (a) the
   difference in fluidelastic forces between two- and one-dimensional flow
   models mostly depends on cylinder radius, and on whether perturbation
   flow is mainly allowed in the axial or circumferential direction, (b)
   the one-dimensional flow model should be limited to 1-d.o.f. vibration
   analysis or the case of a cylinder having a large radius-to-length
   ratio, and (c) the perturbation assumption has little effect on the
   dynamics of annular-flow-induced vibrations; however, the critical flow
   velocity is diminished considerably. Finally, preliminary results
   suggest that fluid friction may significantly modify the predicted model
   dynamics. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{One of the fundamental elements that determines the precision of
   coordinate measuring machines (CMMs) is the probe, which locates
   measuring points within measurement volume. In this paper genetically
   generated fuzzy knowledge based models of three-dimensional (3-D)
   probing accuracy for one-and two-stage touch trigger probes are
   proposed. The fuzzy models are automatically generated using a dedicated
   genetic algorithm developed by the authors. The algorithm uses hybrid
   coding, binary for the rule base and real for the database. This hybrid
   coding, used with a set of specialized operators of reproduction, proved
   to be an effective learning environment in this case. Data collection of
   the measured objects' coordinates was carried out using a special setup
   for probe testing. The authors used a novel method that applies a
   low-force high-resolution displacement transducer for probe error
   examination in 3-D space outside the CMM measurement. The genetically
   generated fuzzy models are constructed for both one stage (TP6) and two
   stage (TP200) types of probes. First, the optimal number of settings is
   defined using an analysis of the influence of fuzzy rules on TP6
   accuracy. Then, once the number of settings is obtained, near optimal
   fuzzy knowledge bases are generated for both TP6 and TP200 triggering
   probes, followed by analysis of the finalized fuzzy rules bases for
   knowledge extraction about the relationships between physical setup
   values and error levels of the probes. The number of fuzzy sets on each
   premise leads to the number of physical setups needed to get
   satisfactory error profiles, whereas the fuzzy rules base adds to the
   knowledge linking the design experiment parameters to the pretravel
   error of CMM machines. Satisfactory fuzzy logic equivalents of the 3-D
   error profiles were obtained for both TP6 and TP200 with root mean
   squsre errors ranging from 0.00mm to a maximum of 0.58 mm.}},

Abstract = {{Despite widespread use, the efficacy of epidural corticosteroid
   injections (ESI) for osteoarthritis-associated neck or radicular pain
   remains uncertain, so even rare serious complications enter into
   discussions about use. However, various factors impede investigation and
   publication of serious adverse events. To that end, we developed new
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques for spinal cord white matter
   quantification and used the best available physiological tests to
   characterize a cervical spinal cord lesion caused by inadvertent
   intramedullary injection of Depo-Medrol. A 29-year-old woman with mild
   cervical osteoarthritis had 2 years of headache and neck pain
   (concussion and whiplash) after 2 minor motor vehicle accidents. During
   C5-6 ESI, she developed new left-sided motor and sensory symptoms, and
   MRI demonstrated a new left dorsal spinal cord cavity. Mild left-sided
   motor and sensory symptoms have persisted for more than 2.5 years,
   during which time we performed serial neurological examinations,
   standard electrodiagnostics, somatosensory evoked potentials, and
   transcranial measurement of cortico-spinal central motor conduction time
   (CMCT). We used 3-Tesla MRI with a 32-channel coil developed for
   high-resolution cervical spinal cord structural imaging, diffusion
   tensor imaging (DTI), and magnetization transfer (MT). T-2({*})-weighted
   signal and DTI and MT metrics showed delayed spread of the lesion across
   4 vertebral levels rostrally, consistent with Wallerian degeneration
   within the ascending left dorsal columns. However, only CMCT metrics
   detected objective correlates of her left hemiparesis and bilateral
   hyperreflexia. DTI and MT metrics may better distinguish between
   post-traumatic demyelination and axonal degeneration than conventional
   MRI. These tests should be considered to better characterize similar
   spinal cord injuries. (C) 2012 International Association for the Study

Abstract = {{During the last decade, important improvements have been made in the
   application of thermodynamic models for studying the molten cryolite
   system used in the Hall-Heroult process. This approach allows a better

   modeling is used to explore the operating windows in the reduction of
   alumina in molten cryolite. The impact of a range of concentrations of
   AlF3, CaF2, and Al2O3 in conventional or ``lithium-free{''} baths is
   also discussed. Subsequently, the model was also used to evaluate the
   impact of additions of lithium fluoride to the bath. Conditions allowing
   an operation at lower cell voltages and lower bath temperatures were
   identified. The modeling approach described in this article is
   considered as an important innovation to revisit fundamentals, to
   constantly re-examine paradigms, and to identify potential modifications

Abstract = {{A total dominating set in a digraph G is a subset W of its vertices such
   that every vertex of G has an immediate successor in W. The total
   domination number of G is the size of the smallest total dominating set.
   We consider several lower bounds on the total domination number and
   conjecture that these bounds are strictly larger than g(G) - 1, where
   g(G) is the number of vertices of the smallest directed cycle contained
   in G. We prove that these new conjectures are equivalent to the
   Caccetta-Haggkvist conjecture which asserts that g(G) - 1 < n/r in every
   digraph on n vertices with minimum outdegree at least r > 0. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{The evolution of the job market has resulted in traditional methods of
   recruitment becoming insufficient. As it is now necessary to handle
   volumes of information (mostly in the form of free text) that are
   impossible to process manually, an analysis and assisted categorization
   are essential to address this issue. In this paper, we present a
   combination of the E-Gen and CORTEX systems. E-Gen aims to perform
   analysis and categorization of job offers together with the responses
   given by the candidates. E-Gen system strategy is based on vectorial and
   probabilistic models to solve the problem of profiling applications
   according to a specific job offer. CORTEX is a statistical automatic
   summarization system. In this work, E-Gen uses Cortex as a powerful
   filter to eliminate irrelevant information contained in candidate
   answers. Our main objective is to develop a system to assist a
   recruitment consultant and the results obtained by the proposed
   combination surpass those of E-Gen in standalone mode on this task. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the manufacturing distortion of curved composite
   parts manufactured by a new Liquid Composite Molding (LCM) process
   called Flexible Injection (FI). This technique uses a deformable tool to
   speed up the fabrication but may generate manufacturing defects when
   strongly curved shapes are processed. The goal of the study is to
   evaluate the impact of such heterogeneities on the dimensional stability
   of the product. Curved components were first manufactured with varying
   processing conditions to achieve a wide range of layup quality. The
   shape stability of the samples was then recorded as a function of
   temperature to measure the thermoelastic component of distortion and
   experimental results were compared with predictions made by two modeling
   techniques. Under certain conditions, manufacturing defects can
   significantly affect the distortion behavior. This suggests that a
   robust preforming procedure is of primary importance to produce curved
   parts by Flexible Injection with a high level of repeatability. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{The paper investigates numerically the effects of a magnetic field upon
   natural convection of electrically conducting fluids contained in
   differentially heated square enclosures filled with fluid-saturated
   porous media. The magnetic field is induced by two electric currents
   flowing parallel to the vertical walls of the enclosures. The Darcy flow
   model is used to describe the fluid flow inside the fluid-saturated
   porous media. It is shown that the magnetic field depends only on the
   distance to the vertical electric currents and, based on the physical
   model, is demonstrated that the overall effect of the induced magnetic
   field is to decrease the intensity of natural convection inside the
   enclosure; therefore, the overall heat transfer crossing the enclosure
   also decreases. Results are obtained for some particular combinations of
   the dimensionless governing parameters, and especially for some
   particular values of the Hartmann number, showing that a reduction in
   natural convection occurs, when the intensity of the magnetic field
   increases. Fluid flow structure and thermal field are analyzed through
   the streamlines and the isotherms. For the physical configuration under
   analysis, it is shown the effect of the induced magnetic field is always
   a reduction of the natural convection taking place inside the enclosure,
   and the consequent reduction of the overall heat transfer crossing it.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a systematic approach to the design of
   application-specific instruction-set processors for high speed
   computation of local neighborhood functions and intra-field
   deinterlacing. The intended application is real-time processing of high
   definition video. The approach aims at an efficient utilization of the
   available memory bandwidth by fully exploiting the data parallelism
   inherent to the target algorithm class. An appropriate choice of custom
   instructions and application-specific registers is used together with a
   very long instruction word architecture in order to mimic a pipelined
   systolic array. This leads to a processing speed close to the limit
   imposed by memory bandwidth constraints. For three intra-field
   deinterlacing algorithms and 2-D convolution with four kernel sizes, the
   design approach yields speedup factors between 36 and 1330, Area-Time
   (AT) product improvements between 12x and 243x, and energy consumption
   reduction factors between 13 and 262.}},

Volume = {{86}},

Month = {{OCT 26}},
Abstract = {{We study the effect of a static magnetic field on the band structure of
   a two-dimensional metallic photonic crystal (MPC). The band structure of
   the MPC has been calculated using the transfer matrix method. It is
   found that the position of the photonic band gap and the band edges of
   the MPC depends on the polarization of the incident light and intensity
   of the applied magnetic field. In our calculations we consider linearly
   polarized light as well as right-and left-circularly polarized light. In
   the case of right-circularly polarized light it is found that as the
   intensity of the magnetic field increases the width of the band gap of
   the crystal decreases. At a certain magnetic field strength the band gap
   disappears altogether. In other words there is a transition from a
   metallic photonic band gap material to a transparent dielectric
   material. This is an interesting effect which is similar to the
   metal-insulator transition that occurs in semiconductors. On the other
   hand, for left-circularly and linear polarized light the band edges
   shift to the higher energy and the band gap increases in the presence of
   a magnetic field. This implies that the MPC switches from a transparent
   state to reflecting states due to the application of the magnetic field.
   This is an interesting effect which might be used to make photonic
   switches.}},

   (with the composition range of Al25Ca25Zn50 to Al20Ca25Zn55) and IM3
   (Al15Ca63Zn22) have been found in this system. In addition, the
   existence of two ternary compounds: C36 and Al2CaZn2 were confirmed.
   Their solubility at 623 K was found to be: C36 (from Al58Ca33Zn9 to
   Al43Ca33Zn24) and Al2CaZn2 (from Al55Ca20Zn25 to Al40Ca20Zn40). Ternary
   solubility of the binary compounds was determined. Based on the current
   results and experimental literature data, the isothermal section of the
   Al-Ca-Zn phase diagram at 623 K was constructed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{106-117}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{Granulation processes can be modeled with the help of population balance
   models. Numerous studies have considered mechanisms such as coalescence
   or breakage to predict the evolution of granulation with respect to
   time. Although these mechanisms play a fundamental role in representing
   the real behavior of such systems, it has become apparent that the flow
   pattern of the particles also needs to be modeled. This work
   investigates granulation with a rotor processor by means of a multiscale
   model involving a population balance model at the process scale, a
   compartmental approach that takes into account specific flow behaviors
   in different zones of the equipment, and a discrete element based model
   at the particle scale. The population balance model is based on an
   event-driven Monte-Carlo algorithm and a time-continuous Markov chain to
   reproduce the particle motion in each compartment. The markov chain
   properties are obtained from a discrete element simulation of the
   particle flow dynamics in the whole domain. The results show that the
   proposed approach improves the accuracy of the population balance model
   when the particle flow is considered. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this study, the authors provide an analytical framework to assess
   network-level quality of service (QoS) measures for differentiated,
   non-saturated traffic in infrastructure-mode 802.11 wireless local area
   networks using the distributed coordination function access mechanism.
   The authors build on a general analytical framework that takes into
   account the medium access control (MAC) access mechanism, the MAC layer
   packet buffer and the characteristics of the offered load to obtain the
   probability of a collision with M classes of traffic. The authors then
   derive analytical expressions for the throughput, the end-to-end packet
   delay and the packet delay outage probability for differentiated
   traffic. A case study of voice-over-IP (VoIP) traffic in 802.11b/g
   networks is used to validate the theoretical framework. The analytical
   results are in good agreement with the simulation results, showing that
   although the collision probability for packets transmitted at the access
   point (AP) is lower than for packets transmitted from the clients, the
   end-to-end delay in the downlink is much longer than that in the uplink
   because of the large queuing delay because of the multiplexing of
   several VoIP connections at the AP. The authors also compare the maximum
   number of VoIP connections that can be admitted in an 802.11 network
   while respecting their QoS constraints; these were computed with the
   proposed theoretical model, an ns-2 simulation model and other schemes
   previously proposed in the literature. The results indicate that their
   approach is more accurate over a wide range of parameter values, thus
   demonstrating the validity, the flexibility and the robustness of the
   proposed theoretical framework.}},

Abstract = {{The evaluation of spinal cord neuronal activity in humans with
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is technically challenging.
   Major difficulties arise from cardiac and respiratory movement artifacts
   that constitute significant sources of noise. In this paper we assessed
   the Correction of Structured noise using spatial Independent Component
   Analysis (CORSICA). FMRI data of the cervical spinal cord were acquired
   in 14 healthy subjects using gradient-echo EPI. Nociceptive electrical
   stimuli were applied to the thumb. Additional data with short TR (250
   ms, to prevent aliasing) were acquired to generate a spatial map of
   physiological noise derived from Independent Component Analysis (ICA).
   Physiological noise was subsequently removed from the long-TR data after
   selecting independent components based on the generated noise map.
   Stimulus-evoked responses were analyzed using the general linear model,
   with and without CORSICA and with a regressor generated from the
   cerebrospinal fluid region. Results showed higher sensitivity to detect
   stimulus-related activation in the targeted dorsal segment of the cord
   after CORSICA. Furthermore, fewer voxels showed stimulus-related signal
   changes in the CSF and outside the spinal region, suggesting an increase
   in specificity. ICA can be used to effectively reduce physiological
   noise in spinal cord fMRI time series. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{A field study was performed in a building complex to investigate the
   extent and sources of lead (Pb) release in tap water and brass material
   was found to be the main contributor in the very first draw (250 mL).
   Based on these results, a pilot installation was built to study Pb
   leaching from old and new faucets in the presence and absence of a
   connection to Cu piping. Four water quality conditions were tested: i)
   no treatment; ii) addition of 0.8 mg P/L of orthophosphate; iii) pH
   adjustment to 8.4; and iv) adjustment to a higher chloride to sulfate
   mass ratio (CSMR; ratio from 0.3 to 2.9). Pb concentrations in samples
   taken from the faucets without treatment ranged from 1 to 52 mu g/L,
   with a mean of 11 mu g/L. The addition of orthophosphate @ 0.8 mg P/L
   (OrthoP) was the most effective treatment for all types of faucets
   tested. On average, OrthoP reduced mean Pb leaching by 41\%, and was
   especially effective for new double faucets (70\%). In the presence of
   orthophosphates, the relative proportion of particulate Pb (Pbpart)
   (>0.45 mu m) increased from 31\% to 54\%. However, OrthoP was not
   efficient to reduce Zn release. The higher CSMR condition was associated
   with greater dezincification of yellow brass but not of red brass.
   Corrosion control treatment influenced Pb concentration equilibrium,
   directly impacting maximal exposure. Significantly higher Pb release (3
   fold) was observed for 1 of the 8 faucets connected to Cu exposed to
   high CSMR water, suggesting the presence of galvanic corrosion. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The presence of natural organic matter (NOM) poses several challenges to
   the commercial practice of UV/H2O2 process for micropollutant removal.
   During the commercial application of UV/H2O2 advanced oxidation
   treatment, NOM is broken down into smaller species potentially affecting
   biostability by increasing Assimilable Organic Carbon (AOC) and
   Biodegradable Organic Carbon (BDOC) of water. This work investigated the
   potential impact of UV/H2O2 treatment on the molecular weight
   distribution of NOM and biostability of different water sources. A
   recently developed flow cytometric method for enumeration of bacteria
   was utilized to assess biological stability of the treated water at
   various stages through measurement of AOC. BDOC was also assessed for
   comparison and to better study the biostability of water. Both AOC and
   BDOC increased by about 3-4 times over the course of treatment,
   indicating the reduction of biological stability. Initial TOC and the
   source of NOM were found to be influencing the biostability profile of
   the treated water. Using high performance size exclusion chromatography,
   a wide range of organic molecule weights were found responsible for AOC
   increase; however, low molecular weight organics seemed to contribute
   more. Positive and meaningful correlations were observed between BDOC
   and AOC of different waters that underwent different treatments. (C)

Title = {{Assessment of mechanical properties of isolated bovine intervertebral
   discs from multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging}},
Journal = {{BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{OCT 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: The treatment planning of spine pathologies requires
   information on the rigidity and permeability of the intervertebral discs
   (IVDs). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers great potential as a
   sensitive and non-invasive technique for describing the mechanical
   properties of IVDs. However, the literature reported small correlation
   coefficients between mechanical properties and MRI parameters. Our
   hypothesis is that the compressive modulus and the permeability of the
   IVD can be predicted by a linear combination of MRI parameters.
   Methods: Sixty IVDs were harvested from bovine tails, and randomly
   separated in four groups (in-situ, digested-6h, digested-18h,
   digested-24h). Multi-parametric MRI acquisitions were used to quantify
   the relaxation times T1 and T2, the magnetization transfer ratio MTR,
   the apparent diffusion coefficient ADC and the fractional anisotropy FA.
   Unconfined compression, confined compression and direct permeability
   measurements were performed to quantify the compressive moduli and the
   hydraulic permeabilities. Differences between groups were evaluated from
   a one way ANOVA. Multi linear regressions were performed between
   dependent mechanical properties and independent MRI parameters to verify
   our hypothesis. A principal component analysis was used to convert the
   set of possibly correlated variables into a set of linearly uncorrelated
   variables. Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering was performed on the 3
   principal components.
   Results: Multilinear regressions showed that 45 to 80\% of the Young's
   modulus E, the aggregate modulus in absence of deformation H-A0, the
   radial permeability k(r) and the axial permeability in absence of
   deformation k(0) can be explained by the MRI parameters within both the
   nucleus pulposus and the annulus pulposus. The principal component
   analysis reduced our variables to two principal components with a
   cumulative variability of 52-65\%, which increased to 70-82\% when
   considering the third principal component. The dendograms showed a
   natural division into four clusters for the nucleus pulposus and into
   three or four clusters for the annulus fibrosus.
   Conclusions: The compressive moduli and the permeabilities of isolated
   IVDs can be assessed mostly by MT and diffusion sequences. However, the
   relationships have to be improved with the inclusion of MRI parameters
   more sensitive to IVD degeneration. Before the use of this technique to
   quantify the mechanical properties of IVDs in vivo on patients suffering
   from various diseases, the relationships have to be defined for each
   degeneration state of the tissue that mimics the pathology. Our MRI
   protocol associated to principal component analysis and agglomerative
   hierarchical clustering are promising tools to classify the degenerated
   intervertebral discs and further find biomarkers and predictive factors
   of the evolution of the pathologies.}},

Abstract = {{During the last decade, studies have shown that 3D list-mode
   ordered-subset expectation-maximization (LM-OSEM) algorithms for
   positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction could be effectively
   computed and considerably accelerated by graphics processing unit (GPU)
   devices. However, most of these studies rely on pre-calculated
   sensitivity matrices. In many cases, the time required to compute this
   matrix can be longer than the reconstruction time itself. In fact, the
   relatively long time required for the calculation of the
   patient-specific sensitivity matrix is considered as one of the main
   obstacle in introducing a list-mode PET reconstruction algorithm for
   routine clinical use. The objective of this work is to accelerate a
   fully 3D LM-OSEM algorithm, including the calculation of the sensitivity
   matrix that accounts for the patient-specific attenuation and
   normalization corrections. For this purpose, sensitivity matrix
   calculations and list-mode OSEM reconstructions were implemented on
   GPUs, using the geometry of a commercial PET system. The system matrices
   were built on-the-fly by using an approach with multiple rays per
   detector pair. The reconstructions were performed for a volume of
   188x188x57 voxels of 2x2x3.15 mm(3) and for another volume of 144x144x57
   voxels of 4x4x3.15 mm(3). The time to compute the sensitivity matrix for
   the 188x188x57 array was 9 s while the LM-OSEM algorithm performed at a
   rate of 1.1 millions of events per second. For the 144x144x57 array, the
   respective numbers are 8 s for the sensitivity matrix and 0.8 million of
   events per second for the LM-OSEM step. This work lets envision fast
   reconstructions for advanced PET applications such as real time dynamic
   studies and parametric image reconstructions.}},

   with HIV to use therapy self-management: study protocol for an online
   randomized controlled trial}},
Journal = {{TRIALS}},

Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Background: Living with HIV makes considerable demands on a person in
   terms of self-management, especially as regards adherence to treatment
   and coping with adverse side-effects. The online HIV Treatment, Virtual
   Nursing Assistance and Education (Virus de I'immunodeficience
   Humaine-Traitement Assistance Virtuelle Infirmiere et Enseignement;
   VIH-TAVIE (TM)) intervention was developed to provide persons living
   with HIV (PLHIV) with personalized follow-up and real-time support in
   managing their medication intake on a daily basis. An online randomized
   controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of
   this intervention primarily in optimizing adherence to combination
   anti-retroviral therapy (ART) among PLHIV.
   Methods/design: A convenience sample of 232 PLHIV will be split evenly
   and randomly between an experimental group that will use the web
   application, and a control group that will be handed a list of websites
   of interest. Participants must be aged 18 years or older, have been on
   ART for at least 6 months, and have internet access. The intervention is
   composed of four interactive computer sessions of 20 to 30 minutes
   hosted by a virtual nurse who engages the PLHIV in a skills-learning
   process aimed at improving self-management of medication intake.
   Adherence constitutes the principal outcome, and is defined as the
   intake of at least 95\% of the prescribed tablets. The following
   intermediary measures will be assessed: self-efficacy and attitude
   towards antiretroviral medication, symptom-related discomfort, and
   emotional support. There will be three measurement times: baseline (T0),
   after 3 months (T3) and 6 months (T6) of baseline measurement. The
   principal analyses will focus on comparing the two groups in terms of
   treatment adherence at the end of follow-up at T6. An intention-to-treat
   (ITT) analysis will be carried out to evaluate the true value of the
   intervention in a real context.
   Discussion: Carrying out this online RCT poses various challenges in
   terms of recruitment, ethics, and data collection, including participant
   follow-up over an extended period. Collaboration between researchers
   from clinical disciplines (nursing, medicine), and experts in behavioral
   sciences information technology and media will be crucial to the
   development of innovative solutions to supplying and delivering health
   services.}},

Abstract = {{A new formulation to investigate the seismic response of symmetric and
   asymmetric rectangular liquid-containing structures is developed and
   validated in this paper. The proposed method is based on a
   substructuring approach, where the flexible liquid-containing structure
   is modeled using finite elements, while the impulsive effects of the
   fluid domain are modeled analytically through interaction forces at the
   fluid-structure interfaces. The technique takes account of geometrical
   or material asymmetry of the liquid-containing structure, fluid
   compressibility, and energy dissipation through reservoir-bottom
   absorption. The formulation is presented in such a way that it can be
   easily coded into a practical and computationally efficient program and
   is applied to illustrative examples highlighting the effects of
   geometrical and material asymmetry on the dynamic responses of
   liquid-containing structures. The obtained frequency-and time-domain
   results are successfully validated against advanced finite-element

Title = {{Non invasive classification system of scoliosis curve types using
   least-squares support vector machines}},
Journal = {{ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{99-107}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To determine scoliosis curve types using non invasive surface
   acquisition, without prior knowledge from X-ray data.
   Methods: Classification of scoliosis deformities according to curve type
   is used in the clinical management of scoliotic patients. In this work,
   we propose a robust system that can determine the scoliosis curve type
   from non invasive acquisition of the 3D back surface of the patients.
   The 3D image of the surface of the trunk is divided into patches and
   local geometric descriptors characterizing the back surface are computed
   from each patch and constitute the features. We reduce the
   dimensionality by using principal component analysis and retain 53
   components using an overlap criterion combined with the total variance
   in the observed variables. In this work, a multi-class classifier is
   built with least-squares support vector machines (LS-SVM). The original
   LS-SVM formulation was modified by weighting the positive and negative
   samples differently and a new kernel was designed in order to achieve a
   robust classifier. The proposed system is validated using data from 165
   patients with different scoliosis curve types. The results of our non
   invasive classification were compared with those obtained by an expert
   using X-ray images.
   Results: The average rate of successful classification was computed
   using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure. The overall accuracy
   of the system was 95\%. As for the correct classification rates per
   class, we obtained 96\%, 84\% and 97\% for the thoracic, double major
   and lumbar/thoracolumbar curve types, respectively.
   Conclusion: This study shows that it is possible to find a relationship
   between the internal deformity and the back surface deformity in
   scoliosis with machine learning methods. The proposed system uses non
   invasive surface acquisition, which is safe for the patient as it
   involves no radiation. Also, the design of a specific kernel improved
   classification performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the glass forming ability of Al-Zr alloys is quantified
   using Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations as well as
   classical thermodynamic calculations. The total energy of each studied
   structure of the Al-Zr system is described using the modified embedded
   atom model in the second-nearest-neighbour formalism. The parameterized
   Al-Zr cross potential which has been extensively validated using
   available experimental and ab initio data for several solid structures
   and for the liquid phase is used to evaluate thermodynamic, structural,
   and physical properties of the glass state and of the fully disordered
   (FD) face-centered cubic (FCC) solid solution with no short range order
   (SRO). The local environment of the Al-Zr amorphous phase is identified
   to be similar to that of a FCC solid structure with short range chemical
   order. A new approach to model the Gibbs energy of the amorphous phase
   based on the cluster variation method in the tetrahedron approximation
   is presented. The Gibbs energy of the fully disordered FCC solid
   solution with no short range order is determined and compared to the
   Gibbs energy of the amorphous phase. According to our volumetric and
   energetic criteria defined in our work to evaluate the possible
   formation of a glass structure at room temperature and zero pressure, a
   glass forming range of (0.25 <= X-Zr <= 0.75) and of (0.21 <= X-Zr <=
   0.75) are identified, respectively. All the available quantitative
   experimental data regarding the amorphization of Al-Zr alloys are
   compared to the prediction of our MD/MC simulations throughout this
   study. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Incentive programs and tax rebates are commonly offered to offset the
   high initial costs of small-scale renewable energy systems (RES) and
   foster their implementation. However, the economic costs of RES grid
   integration must be fully known in order to determine whether such
   subsidies are justified. The objective of this paper is to assess the
   economic value of RES, including their environmental benefits, using
   hourly generation information in conjunction with hourly wholesale price
   data. Reaching the paper's objective will provide a better estimate of
   the bias that could result from neglecting 1) the time pattern of the
   hourly wholesale price, 2) the impacts of carbon taxes on the hourly
   wholesale price and 3) the value of the marginal hourly GHG emissions.
   Selected RES include two types of grid-connected photovoltaic panels (3
   kWp mono- and poly-crystalline) and three types of micro-wind turbines
   (1, 10 and 30 kW) modeled for different climatic conditions in the
   province of Quebec (Canada). The cost of electricity is based on the
   technical performance of these RES using a life cycle costing
   methodology. The economic value of RES electricity is estimated using
   the hourly wholesale electricity price in Northeastern American markets
   in 2006-2008. Results show that distributed generation (DG) has no
   economic benefits using the selected RES, even with a US\$100/tonne of
   CO2-equivalent carbon tax. This finding remains the same when the value
   of the avoided GHG emissions is fully internalized, except for one
   scenario (micro-wind 30 kW). Our results are key to understanding the
   extent to which subsidies for distributed RES can be economically
   sustainable when the latter are integrated into regional networks driven
   by centralized electricity production. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Improving technology readiness and government support have helped some
   forestry companies to continue to develop their biorefinery strategies
   over the past few years, including that for ethanol production in some
   cases. These developing technologies have been proven at various scales,
   and data required for their evaluation are typically scarce and
   uncertain. How can forestry companies select the ``best{''} technology
   among the many options available to them, given this complex and
   uncertain landscape? The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the
   use of an early stage design tool for screening biorefinery
   technologies, using ethanol production as an example. A set of
   multidisciplinary criteria are defined that can be interpreted by a
   stakeholder panel, and calculated based on publically-available data.
   Then, the criteria are interpreted and weighed using multi-criteria
   decision-making (MCDM) analysis in order to make a global evaluation of
   technologies relative to each other, and identify those that should not
   be further considered.}},

Abstract = {{Background/Aim: Multidrug resistance poses a serious challenge in cancer
   therapy. To address this problem, we designed and synthesized Adva-27a,
   a novel non-ester GEM-difluorinated C-glycoside derivative of
   podophyllotoxin. Materials and Methods: Adva-27a activity was evaluated
   in a variety of assays including inhibition of topoisomerase Ha,
   cytotoxic activity in drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cancer cell
   lines, metabolic stability in human liver microsomes and pharmacokinetic
   properties in rats. Results: Adva-27a exhibited dose-dependent human
   topoisomerase II alpha inhibitory activity and dose-dependent growth
   inhibitory activity in several drug-sensitive and two
   multidrug-resistant cancer cell lines. In the multidrug-resistant cell
   lines, MCF-7/MDR (breast cancer) and H69AR (small-cell lung cancer),
   Adva-27a was significantly more potent than etoposide. The metabolic
   stability of Adva-27a in human liver microsomes and its pharmacokinetic
   properties in rats were better than those of etoposide. Conclusion: Our
   studies have identified Adva-27a as a novel topoisomerase II inhibitor
   with superior cytotoxic activity against multidrug-resistant human
   cancer cells and more desirable pharmacokinetic properties than
   etoposide.}},

Abstract = {{A class of three-dimensional planar arrays in substrate integrated
   waveguide (SIW) technology is proposed, designed and demonstrated with 8
   x 16 elements at 35 GHz for millimeter-wave imaging radar system
   applications. Endfire element is generally chosen to ensure initial high
   gain and broadband characteristics for the array. Fermi-TSA (tapered
   slot antenna) structure is used as element to reduce the beamwidth.
   Corrugation is introduced to reduce the resulting antenna physical width
   without degradation of performance. The achieved measured gain in our
   demonstration is about 18.4 dBi. A taper shaped air gap in the center is
   created to reduce the coupling between two adjacent elements. An SIW
   H-to-E-plane vertical interconnect is proposed in this three-dimensional
   architecture and optimized to connect eight 1 x 16 planar array sheets
   to the 1 x 8 final network. The overall architecture is exclusively
   fabricated by the conventional PCB process. Thus, the developed SIW
   feeder leads to a significant reduction in both weight and cost,
   compared to the metallic waveguide-based counterpart. A complete antenna
   structure is designed and fabricated. The planar array ensures a gain of
   27 dBi with low SLL of 26 dB and beamwidth as narrow as 5.15 degrees in
   the E-plane and 6.20 degrees in the 45 degrees-plane.}},

Abstract = {{A wideband planar dielectric rod antenna with substrate integrated
   non-radiative dielectric (SINRD) waveguide feed, is presented in this
   communication for W-band and up-millimeter-wave applications. The
   antenna and its feeding structure are integrated into a single layer
   substrate, which decreases the fabrication cost and integration
   complexity. Simulated and measured results show that the antenna has a
   wide bandwidth. Due to the structure of the SINRD guide which is
   shielded on top and bottom of the substrate, the proposed antenna is
   suitable for multilayer structure techniques such as LTCC or on-chip
   antenna. This antenna presents numerous features such as broad
   bandwidth, relatively high and stable gain, use of high dielectric
   constant substrate, and substrate-oriented end-fire radiation. The
   proposed antenna is suitable for gigabyte chip-to-chip communications.
   Measured bandwidth of the antenna is 10 GHz (93-103 GHz) while a
   relatively flat gain of 9.5 +/- 1 dB is obtained over the bandwidth of

Abstract = {{This communication presents a low-cost 77-GHz switched-beam slot antenna
   array driven by a Butler matrix. In the proposed configuration, four
   broadband couplers are combined and crossovers are effectively avoided.
   In this case, the overall circuit and beamforming network losses are
   considerably reduced. A 4 4 planar SIW Butler matrix is designed and
   demonstrated for integrated beamforming network applications, which
   exhibits about 7 degrees phase error and +/- 0.75 dB coupling imbalance
   over 11\% bandwidth. This experimentally proto-typed matrix is
   integrated with a four-array slot antenna on the same substrate. An
   alternating displacement of the slots in subsequent radiating waveguides
   is proposed to save the arrangement of the input ports and to achieve
   broadband performances. Measured radiation patterns are in good
   agreement with simulated counterparts over the proposed 77-GHz frequency
   range.}},

Abstract = {{A polarization-independent metamaterial analog of electromagnetically
   induced transparency (EIT) at microwave frequencies for normal incidence
   and linearly polarized waves is experimentally and numerically
   demonstrated. The metamaterial consists of coupled ``bright{''}
   split-ring resonators (SRRs) and ``dark{''} spiral resonators (SRs) with
   virtually equal resonance frequencies. Normally incident plane waves
   with linear polarization strongly couple to the SRR, but are weakly
   interacting with the SR, regardless of the polarization state. A sharp
   transmission peak (i.e., the transparency window) with narrow spectral
   width and slow wave property is observed for the metamaterial at the
   resonant frequency of both, the bright SRR and the dark SR. The
   influence of the coupling strength between the SRR and SR on the
   frequency, width, magnitude, and quality factor of the metamaterial's
   transparency window is theoretically predicted by a two-particle model,
   and numerically validated using full-wave electromagnetic simulation. In
   addition, it is numerically demonstrated that the EIT-like metamaterial
   can be employed as a refractive-index-based sensor with a sensitivity of
   77.25 mm/RIU, which means that the resonance wavelength of the sensor
   shifts 77.25 mm per unit change of refractive index of the surrounding
   medium.}},
