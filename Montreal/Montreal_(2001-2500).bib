Abstract = {{As part of a system wide optimization problem in smart grids it is
   required that the mean temperature of a massive number of space heating
   devices associated with energy storage follows a computed target
   temperature trajectory. The classical control approach is to compute the
   required signal centrally for each device and to send that signal.
   However, the corresponding computational and communication requirements
   can be forbidding. Instead, in this paper the presence of large numbers
   of heaters justifies the use of a decentralized mean field control based
   approach to the problem. A novel agent cost structure including an
   integral term is utilized for this purpose. The corresponding system of
   mean field equations is developed, a fixed point analysis is given, an
   is an element of-Nash theorem is presented, and numerical simulation
   results are provided.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are novel devices capable of producing
   electricity while cleaning wastewater. Developing dynamic
   control-oriented models for such systems represents a crucial tool for
   the future design of software sensors and model-based control
   strategies. To this end, this work presents a MFC process
   control-oriented model obtained by combining fundamental equations based
   on mass and electron balances with equations describing an equivalent
   electrical circuit. Such model accounts for the double layer capacitance
   effect and complex nonlinear dynamics observed during pulse-width
   modulated operation of the external resistance and therefore, it is able
   to describe the observed biological or long-term dynamics as well as the
   electrical or short-term dynamics. The parameter estimation for a
   simulation and a prediction MFC process control-oriented model is here
   described.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider linear continuous-time models of evolution of
   opinions in large-scale dynamical networks. Our focus is on dynamical
   networks that are defined on general exogenously given time-varying
   graphs, where the nodes of the underlying graph model individuals (or
   agents) with first-order linear opinion dynamics. In such a network, for
   an arbitrary fixed initial time, a subset of individuals is said to form
   an eminence grise coalition (EGC) if its members are capable of leading
   the entire network to agreeing on any desired value through a
   cooperative choice of their own initial opinions. The coalition members
   are assumed to have access to full profile of the underlying graph of
   the network as well as the initial opinions of all other individuals.
   While the complete coalition of individuals in an opinion network
   trivially qualifies as an EGC, we establish the existence of a minimum
   size EGC for an arbitrary time-varying network and develop a non-trivial
   set of upper and lower bounds on that size. As a result, we show that
   even when the underlying graph does not guarantee convergence to a
   single or multiple consensus, a generally restricted coalition of agents
   can steer public opinion towards a desired consensus without affecting
   any of the predefined graph interactions by having its members
   collectively adjust their own initial opinions. Geometric insights into
   the structure of EGC's are also developed.}},

Abstract = {{We present an original approach to introduce Operating Systems concepts
   to Computer Engineering undergraduate students. These concepts are the
   basis on which students build a mental model of the whole computer in
   order to make important design decisions throughout their career. One
   major challenge in teaching operating systems is the complex,
   intangible, and nondeterministic nature of an actual computer system
   containing many cores operating in parallel.
   We propose a global approach to address this challenge involving a
   full-scale open source operating system, a carefully designed set of
   experiments and novel execution visualization tools. In order to
   deconstruct their preconceptions, students are exposed to phenomena that
   seem contradictory at first glance, but are the result of the
   interaction between the microarchitecture, the operating system and the
   libraries. In the spirit of constructivism, students are invited to
   observe the effect of running their own programs as part of a problem
   solving challenge. Participants can thus observe the duration of
   underlying system calls and the actual scheduling performed by the
   operating system which is otherwise hidden. Experiments are proposed to
   compare the impact of design choices and to lead to improved awareness
   of performance implications. We describe five problem solving activities
   that we developed and expose the purpose of each tool used. In the
   context of the first semester of deployment, we evaluated the activities
   using a qualitative method. We conducted online surveys and a focus
   group, and observed a high learning satisfaction level for students.
   This validates the proposed approach with a high level of confidence.}},

   periodic element of the proposed FSS is built up by a square substrate
   integrated waveguide (SIW) cavity resonator with two stepped-impedance
   resonators (SIRs) orthogonally etched on the its front and back sides.
   Coupling scheme of the proposed FSS element has been presented in
   theoretical analysis and applied in the FSS design. As an example, a
   prototype of the proposed FSS has been designed, fabricated and measured
   at 35GHz. Both the simulated and measured results demonstrate that the
   FSS exhibits polarization rotation characteristic, good frequency
   selectivity and stable frequency response in the passband with a large

Abstract = {{The design, simulation, optimization and experimental demonstration of
   an electrooptic SiO2-CBN-MgO rib waveguide structure are reported in
   this paper. The proposed structure is modeled and optimized by
   simulations. CBN thin film is deposited epitaxially by a pulsed laser
   deposition technique. The CBN rib waveguide structure is patterned using
   plasma etching. The fabricated waveguides are characterized and the
   measured wave profiles are compared with simulated results. The
   agreement between simulation and experiment is found remarkably good,
   thus validating our design approach.}},

Abstract = {{We applied multimodal microscopic imaging of intravascular partial
   pressure of O-2 (PO2) and blood flow complemented by numerical modeling
   to reveal the properties of the cortical microvascular oxygenation that
   allow uninterrupted oxygen delivery to all tissue regions in a very
   dynamic and energetically demanding brain. Our measurements show that at
   the baseline level of neuronal activity small arterioles are responsible
   for a significant oxygen extraction, while the most of the remaining
   oxygen release is taking place at the level of the first few capillary
   branches after precapillary arterioles. The majority of capillaries
   (i.e. high branching order capillaries) release little O-2 at rest and
   our measurements and modeling show that they act as a dynamic O-2
   reserve that is recruited on demand to ensure adequate tissue
   oxygenation during increased neuronal activity or decrease in blood
   flow. These findings have potential to overturn our textbook knowledge
   of the capillary oxygen delivery, impact our understanding of
   progression of diseases that affect cerebral microcirculation, and help
   improving the quantitative interpretation of brain imaging modalities.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents reflection coefficient measurements in order to
   analyze the scattering effect of rough walls and floor on mm-Wave
   propagation at 60 GHz in an underground mine. A 60 GHz frequency domain
   measurement system with directional antennas is considered. Reflection
   coefficients are obtained by individual reflected signals and line of
   sight (LOS) signals with a particular reflective angle then compared
   with theoretical models. Results suggest a distinguishable reflection
   and scattering characteristics between mine wall and floor. In specular
   directions, the path loss difference between the LOS and the reflected
   signal lies between 11 dB to 18 dB. In both surfaces, strong reflections
   on specular directions and scattering on non specular directions have
   been observed. Moreover, wall surface of the mine produces more
   scattering with strong reflections than floor surface. These reflection
   coefficient parameters are useful to estimate multipath signal strength
   in channel modelling for propagation prediction in underground mine.}},

Abstract = {{Non-Gaussian impulsive interference mitigation is of great interest in
   robust and reliable communication over wired and wireless channels. One
   of the most popular impulsive noise cancellation methods used along with
   the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is blanking
   nonlinearity. Although its simplicity and efficiency, the blanking
   method suffers from inter-carrier interference (ICI) problem due to its
   nonlinear characteristic. In this paper, an enhanced version of the
   blanking technique is proposed to cope with the detrimental effects of
   nonlinear characteristic of blanking method. To do so, an iterative
   successive interference cancellation technique is proposed to
   reconstruct ICI and subtract it from received signal in frequency
   domain. Simulation results show that the proposed enhancement in
   blanking method significantly decreases the level of the error floors.
   For instance, a BER of 1.1 x 10(-7) is achievable for highly impulsive
   environments while conventional OFDM systems experience an error floor
   at 1.8 x 10(-2).}},

Abstract = {{We consider distributed estimation of a class of large population
   multi-agent systems where the agents have linear stochastic dynamics and
   are coupled via their partial observations. The measurements
   interference model is assumed to depend only on the empirical mean of
   agents states. In addition, a structural assumption is made on the
   agents' controls which are constrained to be linear constant feedbacks
   on a locally based state estimate.
   In previous work {[}19], we solved precisely the decentralized optimal
   estimation problem for a finite population of agents. In particular, we
   developed a non-sequential bulk estimation algorithm whereby at every

Abstract = {{As part of a system wide optimization problem in smart grids it is
   required that the mean temperature of a massive number of space heating
   devices associated with energy storage follow a precomputed target
   temperature trajectory. The classical control approach is to evaluate
   the required signal centrally for each device and to send that signal.
   However, the corresponding computational and communication requirements
   can be forbidding. In previous work {[}1] an integral error based
   decentralized mean field control approach was followed, the
   corresponding system of mean field equations was developed, and an
   epsilon-Nash theorem was presented. In this work a cooperative mean
   field formulation {[}2] is utilized whereby the resulting set of
   strategies asymptotically achieves the social optimum as N -> infinity.
   The corresponding system of mean field equations is developed, an
   epsilon-Nash theorem is presented, and numerical simulations are
   provided for comparing results based on the two approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud patterns are described as good solutions to recurring design
   problems in a cloud context. These patterns are often inherited from
   Service Oriented Architectures or Object-Oriented Architectures where
   they are considered good practices. However, there is a lack of studies
   that assess the benefits of these patterns for cloud applications. In
   this paper, we conduct an empirical study on a RESTful application
   deployed in the cloud, to investigate the individual and the combined
   impact of three cloud patterns (i.e., Local Database proxy, Local
   Sharding-Based Router and Priority Queue Patterns) on Quality of Service
   (QoS). We measure the QoS using the application's response time,
   average, and maximum number of requests processed per seconds. Results
   show that cloud patterns doesn't always improve the response time of an
   application. In the case of the Local Database proxy pattern, the choice
   of algorithm used to route requests has an impact on response time, as
   well as the average and maximum number of requests processed per second.
   Combinations of patterns can significantly affect the QoS of
   applications. Developers and software architects can make use of these
   results to guide their design decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Like any other software systems, service-based systems (SBSs) evolve
   frequently to accommodate new user requirements. This evolution may
   degrade their design and implementation and may cause the introduction
   of common bad practice solutions-antipatterns-in opposition to patterns
   which are good solutions to common recurring design problems. We believe
   that the degradation of the design of SBSs does not only affect the
   clients of the SBSs but also the maintenance and evolution of the SBSs
   themselves. This paper presents the results of an empirical study that
   aimed to quantify the impact of service patterns and antipatterns on the
   maintenance and evolution of SBSs. We measure the maintenance effort of
   a service implementation in terms of the number of changes and the size
   of changes (i.e., code churns) performed by developers to maintain and
   evolve the service; two effort metrics that have been widely used in
   software engineering studies. Using data collected from the evolutionary
   history of the SBS FraSCAti, we investigate if (1) services involved in
   patterns require less maintenance effort; (2) services detected as
   antipatterns require more maintenance effort than other services; and
   (3) if some particular service antipatterns are more change-prone than
   others. Results show that (1) services involved in patterns require less
   maintenance effort, but not at statistically significant level; (2)
   services detected as antipatterns require significantly more maintenance
   effort than non-antipattern services; and (3) services detected as God
   Component, Multi Service, and Service Chain antipatterns are more
   change-prone (i.e., require more maintenance effort) than the services
   involved in other antipatterns. We also analysed the relation between
   object-oriented code smells and service patterns/antipatterns and found
   a significant difference in the proportion of code smells contained in
   the implementations of service patterns and antipatterns.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for secondary networks improves the
   spectrum utilization by finding spectrum opportunities and exploiting
   them efficiently. A key factor to design a DSA network is the spectrum
   sensing algorithms for multiple channels with multiple users. Multi-user
   cooperative channel sensing reduces the sensing time, thus increasing
   the transmission throughput. However, in a multi-channel system, the
   problem becomes more complex since a sensing schedule, indicating to
   each user the channel that it must sense at different sensing moments,
   must be created to optimize system performance. In this paper, we first
   propose a general sensing strategy to schedule the users according to
   network parameters. We propose three sensing strategies, and within each
   one of them several solutions striking a balance between throughput
   performance, memory usage, and computational complexity are proposed. In
   addition, we show that the proposed sequential sensing strategy is the
   one to be preferred when the sensing time is small, the number of
   channels is large, and the number of users is small. For all the other
   cases, the parallel sensing strategy is recommended in terms of
   throughput performance. We also show that a proposed hybrid
   sequential-parallel sensing strategy achieves the best performance in
   all scenarios at the cost of extra complexity.}},

Abstract = {{To detect integration errors as quickly as possible, organizations use
   automated build systems. Such systems ensure that (1) the developers are
   able to integrate their parts into an executable whole; (2) the testers
   are able to test the built system; (3) and the release engineers are
   able to leverage the generated build to produce the upcoming release.
   The flipside of automated builds is that any incorrect change can break
   the build, and hence testing and releasing, and (even worse) block other
   developers from continuing their work, delaying the project even
   further. To measure the impact of such build breakage, this empirical
   study analyzes 3,214 builds produced in a large software company over a
   period of 6 months. We found a high ratio of build breakage (17.9\%),
   and also quantified the cost of such build breakage as more than 336.18
   man-hours. Interviews with 28 software engineers from the company helped
   to understand the circumstances under which builds are broken and the
   effects of build breakages on the collaboration and coordination of
   teams. We quantitatively investigated the main factors impacting build
   breakage and found that build failures correlate with the number of
   simultaneous contributors on branches, the type of work items performed
   on a branch, and the roles played by the stakeholders of the builds (for
   example developers vs. integrators).}},

Abstract = {{Written communications recorded through channels such as mailing lists
   or issue trackers, but also code co-changes, have been used to identify
   emerging collaborations in software projects. Also, such data has been
   used to identify the relation between developers' roles in communication
   networks and source code changes, or to identify mentors aiding
   newcomers to evolve the software project. However, results of such
   analyses may be different depending on the communication channel being
   mined. This paper investigates how collaboration links vary and
   complement each other when they are identified through data from three
   different kinds of communication channels, i.e., mailing lists, issue
   trackers, and IRC chat logs. Also, the study investigates how such links
   overlap with links mined from code changes, and how the use of different
   sources would influence (i) the identification of project mentors, and
   (ii) the presence of a correlation between the social role of a
   developer and her changes. Results of a study conducted on seven open
   source projects indicate that the overlap of communication links between
   the various sources is relatively low, and that the application of
   networks obtained from different sources may lead to different results.}},

Abstract = {{The paper highlights the potential use of wind energy conversion systems
   for the mitigation of Subsynchronous Resonance (SSR) and Subsynchronous
   Interaction (SSI). SSR and SSI damping is attained by introducing
   supplemental control signals in the reactive power control loops of the
   grid side converters of Full-Frequency Converter (FFC) and Doubly-Fed
   Induction Generator (DFIG) wind turbines. The effectiveness of the
   supplemental control in mitigating the two phenomena is demonstrated on
   a test benchmark through time domain simulation studies using EMTP-RV.}},

Abstract = {{General Bayesian network classifier (GBNC) contains only features
   necessary for classification, so an ideal structure learning solution is
   to learn GBNC without having to learn the whole Bayesian network (BN). A
   local search based algorithm called LAS-GBNC is proposed. Given
   faithfulness assumption, LAS-GBNC relies on the information about each
   variable's appearance in the so-called d-separator(cut set) to sort
   candidate CI tests dynamically, performing `effective' ones with
   priority. Experimental studies indicate that (1) LAS-GBNC achieves the
   same quality of networks as PC and IPC-BNC, (2) It is much more
   efficient than PC due to its local search design, and (3) It is
   obviously faster than IPC-BNC because of its adaptive search strategy.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a Multi-Level Artificial Bee Colony (called MLABC) is
   presented. In MLABC two species are used. The first species employs n
   colonies in which each of the them optimizes the complete solution
   vector. The cooperation between these colonies is carried out by
   exchanging information througha leader colony, which contains a set of
   elite bees. The second species uses a cooperative approach in which the
   complete solution vector is divided to k sub-vectors, and each of these
   sub-vectors is optimized by a colony. The cooperation between these
   colonies is carried out by compiling sub-vectors into the complete
   solution vector. Finally, the cooperation between two species is
   obtained by exchanging information between them. The proposed algorithm
   is tested on a set of well known test functions. The results show that
   MLABC algorithms provide efficiency and robustness to solve numerical
   functions.}},

Abstract = {{The design of complex substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) circuits
   requires the use of sophisticated full-wave simulation tools. When the
   complexity of the circuit increases, the computational effort required
   for the analysis and especially for the optimization of complex SIW
   circuits becomes prohibitive. For this reason the use of equivalent
   circuit models is very beneficial. This paper presents the derivation of
   parametric and multimodal equivalent circuit models of SIW
   discontinuities, based on the boundary integral-resonant mode expansion
   (BI-RME) method. To proof the validity of the models, the use of these
   equivalent circuits for the modeling and design of some SIW circuits, as
   well as for fast sensitivity study, is presented.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a universal and efficient algorithm of domain

   microwave structures but also be used to analyze sparse multi-domain
   electromagnetic fields. The algorithm can greatly increase the accuracy
   of numerical simulations and save computation time and memory space.
   Moreover, by combining the DD-FDTD method with a numerical thru-line
   (TL) calibration technique, an efficient hybrid algorithm is developed
   for the accurate parameter extraction of microwave circuits and
   structures, such as substrate integrated circuits (SICs). The SICs that
   are studied in this work are based on substrate integrated waveguides

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to evaluate the applicability of
   different cavitation models and determine appropriate numerical
   parameters for cavitating flows around a-hydrofoil. The simulations are
   performed for a NACA 66 foil at 6 degrees angle of attack, Reynolds
   number of 750 000 and for a cavitation number of 1.49 corresponding to
   the partial sheet cavitating regime. The incompressible, multiphase
   Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations are solved by the CFD
   solver CFX with Kubota and Merkle cavitation models. As part of the
   work, the Merkle model is implemented into CFX by User Fortran code
   because this model has shown good cavitation prediction capability
   according to the literature. The effects of the k-epsilon and SST
   turbulence models on the cavitating flow dynamics are compared. Also, an
   investigation on structured and hybrid meshes with different mesh sizes
   and concentrations is carried out in order to better understand the mesh
   influence for this cavitation simulation. The local compressibility
   effect is considered by correcting the turbulent eddy viscosity inside
   the mixture vapor/liquid zones. The numerical results are validated by
   experiments conducted in a cavitation tunnel at the French Naval
   Academy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a relation for the added mass coefficient of
   spherical bubbles depending on void fraction based on results obtained
   by a semi-analytical method.
   This information is essential to completely characterize finely
   dispersed bubbly flows, where small spherical gas bubbles are present in
   a continuous liquid phase. Most of the closure relations for Euler-Euler
   or Euler-Lagrange models are obtained from experiments involving single
   bubbles. Their applicability to systems with high void fraction is
   therefore questionable.
   This paper uses solid harmonics to solve 3D potential flow around
   bubbles. Several configurations were calculated for different numbers of
   particles and spatial arrangements. Our results are compared with
   previous studies. Depending on the model proposed by previous authors,
   added mass forces could increase or decrease with the void fraction.
   This paper solves these discrepancies.
   The main purpose of this work is to develop simple formulas fitting our
   semi-analytical results. These simple formulas are suitable for further
   use, particularly as added mass models for multiphase flow averaged

Abstract = {{Predicting vibration effects in steam generators requires good knowledge
   of two-phase damping. The purpose of this work is to correlate two-phase
   damping in axial flow with tube transversal excitation frequency and
   magnitude. The test section consists of a stiff square tube subjected to
   internal axial flow of air-water mixture. The hydraulic diameter is 3
   inches. The tube is supported with linear bearings and fitted with
   flexible tubing on both ends to allow motion in the transverse
   direction. Compression springs allow setting the natural frequency of
   the tube oscillation. A motor provides transverse sinusoidal excitation
   to the tube assembly zeta(2 phi) is determined from the frequency
   response function. As a result of this study, zeta(2 phi) is represented
   as a function of excitation frequency and amplitude, void fraction and
   flow rate. Specific information is gained through high frame rate videos
   of the oscillating tube, including bubble transverse velocity and size
   for low void fraction, and flow pattern transitions. Indeed, it is
   suspected that two-phase damping is partly caused by the work rate of
   virtual mass forces of the gas phase. Better knowledge of the physical
   process involved in two-phase damping will allow better modeling and
   prediction of tube behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Fretting wear of steam generator tubes due to vibration induced by fluid
   flow remains a serious problem in the nuclear industry. Azizian and
   Mureithi {[}1] have recently developed a hybrid friction model to
   simulate the friction behavior of tube support interaction. However,
   identification of the model parameters remains unresolved.
   To identify the parameters of the friction model, the following
   quantities are required: contact forces (tangential force (friction) and
   normal force (impact)), the slip velocity and displacement in the
   contact region. Direct measurement of these quantities by using a steam
   generator tube interacting with its supports is difficult. To simplify
   the problem, a beam, clamped at one end and simply supported with
   consideration of friction effect at the other is used. The beam acts as
   a mechanical amplifier of the friction effects at the microscopic level.
   Using this simple setup, the contact forces, the sliding velocity and
   the displacement can be indirectly obtained from the beam's vibration
   response measurements.
   A new method based on nonlinear modal analysis was developed to
   calculate the contact forces. This method is based on the modal
   superposition principle and Fourier series expansion. The nonlinear
   normal modes (NNMs) and the generalized coordinates (GCs) have been
   identified experimentally as functions of the excitation level, the
   frequency, the preload in the contact area, with and without
   lubrication.
   Three hypotheses and related analyses to identify the NNMs and GCs were
   tested; the analysis based on the harmonic balance method gives the best
   results for reconstructing the accelerometer signals with an error less
   than 2\% for all excitation levels compared to more than 2\% for other
   methods.
   The successful signal reconstruction makes it possible to accurately
   identify the parameters of the Dahl friction model. This is also the
   first step to identify the parameters of the hybrid friction model.}},

   90\%. Additionally, the streamwise steady forces were measured in
   two-phase flow at a Reynolds number (based on the pitch velocity), Re =
   7.2 x 10(4). The results are compared to those previously obtained for
   transverse direction oscillations. The measurement results show that the
   magnitude of the force coefficients for both directions (drag and lift)
   is comparable both in trend and quantitatively. However, the phase in
   the drag direction is negative while that for the lift is positive. The
   range of variation of the phase is also significantly smaller for the
   drag direction. Noting that negative phase corresponds to positive
   damping and vice versa, this observation confirms previous findings of
   lack of instability in the drag direction for a single flexible tube in
   a rotated triangular tube array. The drag steady fluid force
   coefficients were found to increase with dimensionless displacement in
   the flow direction for the entire range of void fractions considered.
   The derivative of the measured steady fluid force coefficient, which is
   an important factor in fluidelastic instability study using the
   quasi-steady model, was found to remain positive in the drag direction.
   The effect of void fraction on the unsteady fluid force coefficient and
   other dynamic parameters such as hydrodynamic mass and damping are also
   discussed.}},

   rigid horizontal wall based on potential flow theory. The model is then
   compared with experiments of air bubbles surrounded by water impacting a

   and different trajectory types (helicoidal, zig-zag). Deformation and
   height of the first impact are the main comparison points. The proposed
   model is in good agreement with the height of the rebound but tends to
   overestimate the maximal compression for both types of trajectories.
   We also propose a new relation for the viscous drag coefficient
   correction induced by the wall confinement as well as the definition of
   potential pressure forces acting on bubbles close to a wall.}},

Abstract = {{Flow-induced vibration in two-phase flows requires the knowledge of flow
   regime and detailed flow characteristics. This paper outlines the
   development of fiber-optic probes to measure void fraction, local flow
   velocity and characteristic size (i.e., bubble diameter) of the
   two-phase mixture. The principle of operation of such probes is based on
   the difference in index of refraction between the liquid phase and the
   gas phase when in contact with a fiber-optic probe supplied with a laser
   light. The reflected signal levels for the gas phase and the liquid
   phase are very different thus providing a reliable measure of void
   fraction.
   The paper describes the development of fiber-optic probes for
   measurements of internal two-phase flow in pipes and of external flow
   across a tube bundle. The use of double probes allows the measurements
   of local flow velocity and bubble size. Some detail measurements of flow
   in the gap between tubes in cross flow are presented. The fabrication of
   the very small and fragile probes required much development effort. The
   paper describes the difficulties and the solutions to assure good
   quality probes. Some data processing and data interpretation issues are
   also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the possibility to use potential theory to predict
   fluidelastic instability critical velocity in tube bundles. Potential
   flow is calculated semi analytically using Laurent expansions with the
   addition of discrete vortices behind the tube. The only experimental
   criterion used in this approach is the location of vortices behind the
   tubes. Using the linearized unsteady Bernoulli theorem we are able to
   model fluid forces as added mass, damping and stiffness effects. Fluid
   forces include coupling terms; that is the force on another tube induced
   by tube acceleration, velocity and location. The tube array is then
   described by a mass, damping and stiffness. The fluidelastic instability
   critical velocity becomes the solution of a linear eigenvalue problem.
   This approach has been compared with several experimental values of
   mass, damping and stiffness measurements, as well as the critical
   velocity. Mass matrix is in a very good agreement with experimental
   values, however damping and stiffness models still need some
   improvement. In the end, the model is able to predict the critical
   velocity within 20\% of experimental values. This approach does not need
   stiffness experimental values (stability derivative) nor time delay as
   the stiffness, damping and mass matrices are calculated independently.
   The main purpose of this work is to understand the effect of induced
   forces involved in the fluidelastic instability.}},

Abstract = {{VIBIC (Vibration of Beams with Intermittent Contacts) is a non-linear
   dynamics computer code developed and maintained by Atomic Energy of
   Canada Limited over the past 40 years in collaboration with
   universities. Its main application is the assessment of possible
   vibration damage to steam-generator and heat exchanger tubes. This
   assessment is done by performing simulations of the vibration response
   of beam-like structures to various flow-induced excitation mechanisms,
   such as turbulence buffeting, vortex shedding, and fluidelastic
   excitation. Fluidelastic excitation is potentially the most damaging
   flow-induced excitation mechanism. The fluidelastic effect has, until
   now, been incorporated in VIBIC using the frequency-based Connors model.
   To properly perform a time-domain simulation of fluidelastic-induced
   vibration, a time-domain fluidelastic force model is needed. In the
   present work, a time-domain formulation of the fluidelastic forces based
   on the quasi-steady model is implemented in VIBIC. The time delay
   inherent to the quasi-steady model is taken into account by using a
   delayed displacement in the expression of the fluidelastic forces. The
   resulting modal equations are delay differential equations that are
   solved using a continuous extension of the Runge-Kutta method. Both
   linear and nonlinear fluid force models are incorporated. The
   fluidelastic instability results predicted by the models are compared to
   known theoretical and experimental results for validation. The
   predictions of the models are in good agreement with those results. The
   results given by the nonlinear quasi-steady fluidelastic forces are
   found to be more realistic than those of the linear quasi-steady
   fluidelastic forces. A realistic simulation of the post-instability
   behaviour is made possible through the use of the nonlinear fluidelastic
   forces.}},

Abstract = {{To reduce the damage caused by induced vibrations due to two-phase cross
   flow on tube bundles in heat exchangers, a deep understanding of the
   different sources of this phenomenon is required. For this purpose, a
   numerical model was previously developed to simulate the quasi periodic
   forces on the tube bundle due to two-phase cross flow. An Euler-Lagrange
   approach is adopted to describe the flow. The Euler approach describes
   the continuous phase (liquid) using potential flow. The dispersed phase
   is assumed to have no interaction on liquid flow. Based on visual
   observation, static vortices behind the tube are introduced. The
   Lagrange approach describes the dispersed phase (gas). The model allows
   bubbles to split up or to coalesce. The forces taken into account acting
   on the bubbles are the buoyancy, the drag and induced drag, the added
   mass and induced added mass and impact force (bubble-bubble and
   bubble-tube). Forces taken into account acting on the tubes are impact
   forces and induced drag and added mass forces. This model allows us to
   obtain quasi periodic force on tube induced by two-phase cross flow of
   relative good magnitude and frequency contains. The model still needs
   improvement to bring us closer to experimental data of force, for
   example by introducing a dependency between the void ratio and the
   intensity of the vortex and by taking into account the bubbles
   deformation.}},

   expression of bone regenerating molecules in cases of distraction
   osteogenesis}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Abstract = {{Distraction osteogenesis (DO) is a surgical technique where gradual and
   controlled separation of two bony fragments following an osteotomy leads
   to the induction of new bone formation in the distracted gap. DO is used
   for limb lengthening, correction of bony deformities, and the
   replacement of bone loss secondary to infection, trauma, and tumors.
   Although DO gives satisfactory results in most cases, one major drawback
   of this technique is the prolonged period of time the external fixator
   has to be kept on until the newly formed bone consolidates thus leading
   to numerous complications. Numerous attempts at accelerating bone
   formation during DO have been reported. One specific approach is
   manipulation of the mechanical environment during DO by applying changes
   in the standard protocol of distraction. Attempts at changing this
   mechanical environment led to mixed results. Increasing the rate or
   applying acute distraction, led to poor bone formation in the distracted
   zone. On the other hand, the addition of compressive forces (such as
   weight bearing, alternating distraction with compression or by
   over-lengthening, and then shortening) has been reported to increase
   bone formation. It still remains unclear why these alterations may lead
   to changes in bone formation. While the cellular and molecular changes
   occurring during the standard DO protocol, specifically increased
   expression of transforming growth factor-beta 1, platelet-derived growth
   factor, insulin-like growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor,
   vascular endothelial growth factor, and bone morphogenic proteins have
   been extensively investigated, the literature is sparse on the changes
   occurring when this protocol is altered. It is the purpose of this
   article to review the pertinent literature on the changes in the
   expression of various proteins and molecules as a result of changes in
   the mechanical loading technique in DO and try to define potential
   future research directions.}},

Title = {{An exploration of the effect of hemodynamic changes due to normal aging
   on the fNIRS response to semantic processing of words}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Abstract = {{Like other neuroimaging techniques assessing cerebral blood oxygenation,
   near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been applied in many
   neurocognitive studies. With NIRS, neural activation can be explored
   indirectly via hemodynamic changes in the imaged region. In studies of
   aging, changes in baseline physiology and brain anatomy confound NIRS
   measures seeking to investigate age-related changes in neuronal
   activity. The field is thus hampered by the complexity of the aging
   process itself, and statistical inferences from functional data acquired
   by optical imaging techniques must be interpreted with care. Multimodal
   integration of NIRS with both structural and baseline physiological
   assessments is crucial to avoid misinterpreting neuroimaging signals. In
   this study, a combination of two different optical techniques,
   anatomical MRI and Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL), was used to investigate
   age-related changes in activation during a lexical-semantic processing
   task. Quantitative analysis revealed decreased baseline oxyhemoglobin
   and cerebral blood flow in the older adults. Using baseline physiology
   measures as regressors in the investigation of functional concentration
   changes when doing analyses of variance, we found significant changes in
   task-induced areas of activity. In the right hemisphere, more
   significant age-related activity was observed around the junction of the
   inferior frontal gyrus and inferior precentral sulcus, along with
   engagement of Wernicke's area. In the left hemisphere, the degree and
   extent of frontal activation, including the dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex and inferior frontal gyrus, differed between age groups.
   Measuring background physiological differences and using their values as
   regressors in statistical analyses allowed a more appropriate,
   age-corrected understanding of the functional differentiations between
   age groups. Age-corrected baselines are thus essential to investigate
   which components of the NIRS signal are altered by aging.}},

   stored in each sub-modules. This paper deals with the modeling and the
   control of modular multilevel converters. Since the voltage fluctuations
   between the arms of each phase introduce circulating currents containing
   a second harmonic component, which distorts the arm currents and may
   increase the ripple on capacitor voltages, a control approach based on
   resonant controller is proposed to eliminate the circulating currents.
   The effectiveness of the proposed control method is illustrated by
   numerical simulations and compared with a classical approach commonly
   used in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Load control has traditionally been viewed as a useful tool for peak
   load reduction in power systems. With the increasing renewable energy
   penetration in the grid, load control is also considered as a tool to
   exploit the storage in dispersed devices naturally present in power
   systems such as electric water heaters to mitigate generation
   variability. Tapping into the storage dispersed across the power system
   is challenging because of the large number of devices that need to be
   coordinated to produce desirable system level behavior. In this paper a
   mean field game theoretic based control architecture is proposed as a
   load control mechanism to limit the required flows of information, and
   produce local constraints conscious decentralized individual controls
   which aggregate to a desired mean behavior. A Markovian jump-driven
   model of individual electric water heating loads is employed where the
   mean field effect is mediated through the quadratic cost function
   parameters under the form of an integral error. The corresponding system
   of mean field Nash equilibrium inducing equations is developed and
   numerical simulation results are presented.}},

Abstract = {{In the work of Huang (2010) and Nguyen and Huang (2012) the linear
   quadratic mean field systems and control problem is solved in the case
   where there is a major agent (i.e. non-asymptotically vanishing as the
   population size goes to infinity) together with a population of minor
   agents (i.e. individually asymptotically negligible). The new feature in
   this case is that the mean field becomes stochastic and by minor agent
   state extension Nguyen and Huang (2012) establish the existence of
   epsilon-Nash equilibria together with the individual agents' control
   laws that yield the equilibria. This paper presents results initially
   announced in Caines and Kizilkale (2013); Caines (2013) where it is
   shown that if the major agent's state is partially observed by the minor
   agents, and if the major agent completely observes its own state, all
   agents can recursively generate estimates (in general individually
   distinct) of the major agent's state and the mean field, and thence
   generate feedback controls yielding epsilon-Nash equilibria.}},

Title = {{Influence of tubificid worms on nutrient fluxes across water-sediment
   interface in fish farm settling ponds}},
Journal = {{KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{413}},
Abstract = {{The influence of tubificid worms on nutrient translocation from water to
   fish farm sediments accumulating in settling ponds was addressed under
   laboratory conditions. Small microcosms of 0.5 L were filled up with 35
   g of sludge from a fish farm settling pond and 0.15 L of filtered
   settling pond water. The experimental set up consisted of one control
   line (no worms added), a second experimental line with 1 mg of tubificid
   worms center dot g(-1) fresh sediment (550 individuals center dot m(-2))
   and a third experimental line with 40 mg of tubificid worms center dot
   g(-1) fresh sediment (22 000 individuals center dot m(-2)). Nutrients
   translocation was determined by monitoring overlaying water
   concentration of ammonia, nitrate and phosphate for ten days. Results
   showed that abundances of 550 individuals center dot m(-2) had no
   significant influence on the fluxes of nutrients here considered.
   However, the influence of higher abundances of tubificids (22 000
   individuals center dot m(-2)) was of significant extent on the
   translocation of nitrate and phosphate. Accordingly, bioturbation of
   tubificids caused 55\% lower nitrate uptake by the sediment when
   compared to control conditions. Phosphorus released by the sediments of
   the control condition was ca. 90\% higher than that recorded under
   abundances of tubificids (22 000 individuals center dot m(-2)). Results
   obtained allowed us to estimate that fish farm settling ponds highly
   colonized by tubificid worms (22 000 individuals center dot m(-2)) may
   contribute to decrease phosphorus discharge (in terms of soluble
   phosphorus) in ca. 5 g of P center dot ton(-1) of fish produced.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with a numerical modelling technique based on finite
   elements method (FEM) in microwave frequency for computing the
   dielectric constant and loss factor of a homogeneous dielectric material
   by using conical-type coaxial probe. This sort of probe can be easily
   inserted into a wide range of biological tissue types and semi-rigid
   materials like rubber, some plastics, and organic materials (ex: dairy,
   butter, etc. for measuring moisture content). Where his feature is
   considered to be very important in biological and industrial
   applications. The measuring principle is based on detecting conductance
   and capacitance change with respect to the dielectric mass movement in
   the fringe electrical field. A three-dimensional finite-element
   formulation is employed in the dielectric material region and a small
   neighbouring region of the probe structure on which it is mounted. The
   electrical input admittance as well as the reflection coefficient are
   found from the finite-element analysis. From this, the conductance and
   capacitance related to the conical probe and fringing field are
   calculated and consequently the dielectric constant and loss factor are
   determined. In contrast to many other modelling techniques used for
   coaxial probe which are approximate and hence limited, the
   finite-element model is more exact and is applicable to complicated
   geometries. To demonstrate the accuracy of the numerical model, a
   parallel experimental study was carried out in the laboratory for the
   same geometric dimensions. The two results are compared and show
   excellent agreement, and also demonstrating that finite-element
   modelling is a good approach for optimized conical coaxial probe design.}},

   for derivative free optimization. We present different formulations for

   framework. The proposed formulations are tested on two simulation-based
   multidisciplinary design optimization problems. Numerical results

Abstract = {{Human movement modeling can be of great interest for the design of
   pattern recognition systems relying on the understanding of the fine
   motor control (such as on-line handwriting recognition or signature
   verification) as well as for the development of intelligent systems
   involving in a way or another the processing of human movements. In this
   paper, we briefly list the different models that have been proposed in
   order to characterize the handwriting process and focus on a
   representation involving a vectorial summation of lognormal functions:
   the Sigma-lognormal model. Then, from a practical perspective, we
   describe a new stroke extraction algorithm suitable for the reverse
   engineering of handwriting signals. In the following section it is shown
   how the resulting representation can be used to study the writer and
   signer variability. We then report on two joint projects dealing with
   the automatic generation of synthetic specimens for the creation of
   large databases. The first application concerns the automatic generation
   of totally synthetic signature specimens for the training and evaluation
   of verification performances of automatic signature recognition systems.
   The second application deals with the synthesis of handwritten gestures
   for speeding up the learning process in customizable on-line recognition
   systems to be integrated in electronic pen pads. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This paper introduces the multi-district team orienteering problem. In
   this problem, one must schedule a set of mandatory and optional tasks
   located in several districts, within a planning horizon. The total
   available time determined by the length of the planning horizon must be
   distributed among the districts. All mandatory tasks within each
   district must be performed, while the other tasks can be performed if
   time allows. A positive profit or score is collected whenever an
   optional task is performed. Additionally, some incompatibility
   constraints between tasks are taken into account. The objective is to
   determine a schedule for a set of tasks to be performed daily within
   each district, while maximizing the total collected profit. A mixed
   integer formulation and an adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic
   are proposed for this problem. The performance of the proposed algorithm
   is assessed over a large set of randomly generated instances.
   Computational results confirm the efficiency of the algorithm. (C) 2013

Title = {{An adaptive large neighborhood search for a vehicle routing problem with
   multiple routes}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& OPERATIONS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Pages = {{167-173}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The vehicle routing problem with multiple routes consists in determining
   the routing of a fleet of vehicles when each vehicle can perform
   multiple routes during its operations day. This problem is relevant in
   applications where the duration of each route is limited, for example
   when perishable goods are transported. In this work, we assume that a
   fixed-size fleet of vehicles is available and that it might not be
   possible to serve all customer requests, due to time constraints.
   Accordingly, the objective is first to maximize the number of served
   customers and then, to minimize the total distance traveled by the
   vehicles. An adaptive large neighborhood search, exploiting the
   ruin-and-recreate principle, is proposed for solving this problem. The
   various destruction and reconstruction operators take advantage of the
   hierarchical nature of the problem by working either at the customer,
   route or workday level. Computational results on Euclidean instances,
   derived from well-known benchmark instances, demonstrate the benefits of
   this multi-level approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We study the finite element approximation of two methods to weakly
   impose a slip boundary condition for incompressible fluid flows: the
   Lagrange multiplier method and Nitsche's method. For each method, we can
   distinguish several formulations depending on the values of some real

   polyhedral boundary, we prove convergence results of their finite
   element approximations, extending previous results of Verfurth {[}33]
   and we show numerical results confirming them. In the case of a spatial
   domain with a smooth curved boundary, numerical results show that
   approximations computed on polygonal domains approximating the original
   domain may not converge to the exact solution, depending on the values
   of the aforementioned parameters and on the finite element
   discretization. These negative results seem to highlight Babuska's like
   paradox, due to the approximation of the boundary by polygonal ones. In
   particular, they seem to contradict some of Verfurth's theoretical
   convergence results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Program comprehension is an essential part of any maintenance activity.
   It allows developers to build mental models of the program before
   undertaking any change. It has been studied by the research community
   for many years with the aim to devise models and tools to understand and
   ease this activity. Recently, researchers have introduced the use of
   eye-tracking devices to gather and analyze data about the developers'
   cognitive processes during program comprehension. However, eye-tracking
   devices are not completely reliable and, thus, recorded data sometimes
   must be processed, filtered, or corrected. Moreover, the analysis
   software tools packaged with eye-tracking devices are not open-source
   and do not always provide extension points to seamlessly integrate new
   sophisticated analyses. Consequently, we develop the TAUPE software
   system to help researchers visualize, analyze, and edit the data
   recorded by eye-tracking devices. The two main objectives of TAUPE are
   compatibility and extensibility so that researchers can easily: (1)
   apply the system on any eye-tracking data and (2) extend the system with
   their own analyses. To meet our objectives, we base the development of
   TAUPE: (1) on well-known good practices, such as design patterns and a
   plug-in architecture using reflection, (2) on a thorough documentation,
   validation, and verification process, and (3) on lessons learned from
   existing analysis software systems. This paper describes the context of
   development of TAUPE, the architectural and design choices made during
   its development, and its documentation, validation and verification
   process. It also illustrates the application of TAUPE in three
   experiments on the use of design patterns by developers during program
   comprehension. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Previous work from our group suggested that the giant magnetoimpedance

   removing a hypothetical hard magnetic shell on the surface of the

   treatment. Although we measured a reduction in diameter of the
   microwires and ensured that their bulk magnetic properties remained
   unchanged, it was found that the surface treatment did not improve the

Title = {{Imaging of an Inflammatory Injury in the Newborn Rat Brain with
   Photoacoustic Tomography}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Background: The precise assessment of cerebral saturation changes during
   an inflammatory injury in the developing brain, such as seen in
   periventricular leukomalacia, is not well defined. This study
   investigated the impact of inflammation on locoregional cerebral oxygen
   saturation in a newborn rodent model using photoacoustic imaging.
   Methods: 1 mg/kg of lipopolysaccharide(LPS) diluted in saline or saline
   alone was injected under ultrasound guidance directly in the corpus
   callosum of P3 rat pups. Coronal photoacoustic images were carried out
   24 h after LPS exposure. Locoregional oxygen saturation (SO2) and
   resting state connectivity were assessed in the cortex and the corpus
   callosum. Microvasculature was then evaluated on cryosection slices by
   lectin histochemistry.
   Results: Significant reduction of SO2 was found in the corpus callosum;
   reduced SO2 was also found in the cortex ipsilateral to the injection
   site. Seed-based functional connectivity analysis showed that bilateral
   connectivity was not affected by LPS exposure. Changes in locoregional
   oxygen saturation were accompanied by a significant reduction in the
   average length of microvessels in the left cortex but no differences
   were observed in the corpus callosum.
   Conclusion: Inflammation in the developing brain induces marked
   reduction of locoregional oxygen saturation, predominantly in the white
   matter not explained by microvascular degeneration. The ability to
   examine regional saturation offers a new way to monitor injury and
   understand physiological disturbance non-invasively.}},

Abstract = {{Solid particle erosion (SPE) degradation of components in aircraft
   operating in harsh environments is a well known issue causing severe
   maintenance and reliability problems. In order to enhance the lifetime
   of engine components, many different hard protective coatings have been
   developed and present varying material removal mechanisms depending on
   their phase constitution and microstructure, and on erodent
   characteristics. Studying these mechanisms in detail is quite
   challenging given that SPE testing is notoriously inaccurate due to its
   aggressive nature and its many methodological uncertainties. In the
   present work, a novel in situ real-time erosion testing methodology has
   been developed using a quartz crystal microbalance in order to study the
   SPE of hard protective coating systems. Using conventional mass loss SPE
   testing, we validate and discuss the advantages and challenges related
   to such a method. Finally, this time-resolved technique enables us to
   discuss some transient events present during SPE testing of hard coating
   systems leading to new insights into the erosion process. (C) 2013

Title = {{The lognormal hand en learning, performing, and declining}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC 19}},
Abstract = {{The generation of handwriting is a complex neuromotor skill requiring
   the interaction of many cognitive processes. It aims at producing a
   message to be imprinted as an ink trace left on a writing medium. The
   generated trajectory of the pen tip is made up of strokes superimposed
   over time. The Kinematic Theory of rapid human movements and its family
   of lognormal models provide analytical representations of these strokes,
   often considered as the basic unit of handwriting. This paradigm has not
   only been experimentally confirmed in numerous predictive and
   physiologically significant tests but it has also been shown to be the
   ideal mathematical description for the impulse response of a
   neuromuscular system. This latter demonstration suggests that the
   lognormality of the velocity patterns can be interpreted as reflecting
   the behavior of subjects who are in perfect control of their movements.
   To illustrate this interpretation, we present a short overview of the
   main concepts behind the Kinematic Theory and briefly describe how its
   models can be exploited, using various software tools, to investigate
   these ideal lognormal behaviors. We emphasize that the parameters
   extracted during various tasks can be used to analyze some underlying
   processes associated with their realization. To investigate the
   operational convergence hypothesis, we report on two original studies.
   First, we focus on the early steps of the motor learning process as seen
   as a converging behavior toward the production of more precise lognormal
   patterns as young children practicing handwriting start to become more
   fluent writers. Second, we illustrate how aging affects handwriting by
   pointing out the increasing departure from the ideal lognormal behavior
   as the control of the fine motricity begins to decline. Overall, the
   paper highlights this developmental process of merging toward a
   lognormal behavior with learning, mastering this behavior to succeed in
   performing a given task, and then gradually deviating from it with
   aging.}},

Journal = {{TECTONOPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{609}},
Number = {{SI}},

Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{The seismic Moho discontinuity is not always consistent with a chemical
   boundary (the ``petrological Moho{''}) that separates the mafic lower
   crust from the ultramafic upper mantle. We summarize the effects of
   pressure, temperature and metamorphism on seismic and electrical
   properties of lower crustal and mantle rocks. The sharpness of the Moho
   discontinuity is generally related with the petrological transition from
   olivine-poor to olivine-rich compositions. Due to serpentinizatlion, the
   seismic Moho may not correspond with the petrological Moho beneath the
   oceanic crust and forearcs. More precise velocity-density relationships
   are established for typical oceanic and continental crust-mantle
   boundaries, as well as for serpentinization of peridotites at low and
   high temperatures. Combined with Poisson's ratio, the occurrence of
   continental lowest crust with Vp >7.2 km/s may reflect pyroxenites and
   garnet gabbros by magma underplating, or eclogitization of gabbros and
   mafic granulites by crustal thickening. On the other hand, the
   ``electrical Moho{''} is defined as the bottom of the relatively
   conductive continental lower crust (10(-4) to 10(-1) S/m). Electrical
   conductivity of granulites and peridotites is mainly controlled by
   temperature, composition (iron content and water content) and oxygen
   fugacity, but weakly depends on pressure. Even a small amount of
   hydrogen can significantly enhance electrical conductivity of olivine,
   pyroxene and garnet. Although amphibole and serpentine are resistive
   under their stability conditions, their electrical conductivity will be
   remarkably increased by dehydration reaction at temperature >600 degrees
   C. Granulites and eclogites show similar conductivity of 10(-4) to
   10(-2) S/m at 500-1000 degrees C, about one order more conductive than
   water-poor garnet pyroxenites and spinel peridotites. Therefore the
   depth of the electrical Moho varies with temperature and water content
   at the crust-mantle boundary. The discrepancy between the seismic,
   electrical and petrological Moho in different tectonic provinces
   highlights the Moho as an active transition zone in the crust-mantle
   system. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Eumelanin is a ubiquitous pigment in the human body, animals, and
   plants, with potential for bioelectronic applications because of its
   unique set of physical and chemical properties, including strong UV-vis
   absorption, mixed ionic/electronic conduction, free radical scavenging
   and anti-oxidant properties. Herein, a detailed investigation is
   reported of eumelanin thin films grown on substrates patterned with gold
   electrodes as a model system for device integration, using electrical
   measurements, atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy,
   fluorescence microscopy, and time-of-flight secondary ion mass
   spectroscopy. Under prolonged electrical biasing in humid air, one can
   observe gold dissolution and formation of gold-eumelanin nanoaggregates,
   the assembly of which leads to the formation of dendrites forming
   conductive pathways between the electrodes. Based on results collected
   with eumelanins from different sources, a mechanism is proposed for the
   formation of the nanoaggregates and dendrites, taking into account the
   metal binding properties of eumelanin. The surprising interaction
   between eumelanin and gold points to new opportunities for the
   fabrication of eumelanin-gold nanostructures and biocompatible memory
   devices and should be taken into account in the design of devices based
   on eumelanin thin films.}},

Journal = {{IET SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{863-878}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In applying Shannon's sampling theorem, evaluation of the sampled signal
   Fourier spectrum is based on the fact that sampling the continuous-time
   signal is the result of multiplying the signal by distributions. If the
   signal has discontinuities, a multiplication of distributions - an
   undefined operation - is encountered. Such undefined operation has led
   to errors in the literature which to date accompany the formulation of
   sampling of signals containing discontinuities. This paper presents an
   approach to evaluating the product of distributions as a means of
   sampling discontinuous signals, eliminating such errors. It is shown
   that the value of the product of distributions may be found by invoking
   the Mittag-Leffler expansion. As an illustration of errors that have
   existed for decades and still exist in the digital signal processing
   literature whenever discontinuous signals are sampled the approach of
   impulse invariance provides a case in point. It was already noted that
   this approach has an inherent error. Yet, impulse invariance is still
   considered as one of the two main approaches for converting analogue to
   digital filters. In this study, the true spectra of sampled
   discontinuous signals are evaluated, and a new approach to the
   transformations between continuous-time and discrete-time systems
   eliminating the error, is proposed.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Like any other large and complex software systems, Service-Based Systems
   (SBSs) must evolve to fit new user requirements and execution contexts.
   The changes resulting from the evolution of SBSs may degrade their
   design and quality of service (QoS) and may often cause the appearance
   of common poor solutions in their architecture, called antipatterns, in
   opposition to design patterns, which are good solutions to recurring
   problems. Antipatterns resulting from these changes may hinder the
   future maintenance and evolution of SBSs. The detection of antipatterns
   is thus crucial to assess the design and QoS of SBSs and facilitate
   their maintenance and evolution. However, methods and techniques for the
   detection of antipatterns in SBSs are still in their infancy despite
   their importance. In this paper, we introduce a novel and innovative
   approach supported by a framework for specifying and detecting
   antipatterns in SBSs. Using our approach, we specify 10 well-known and
   common antipatterns, including Multi Service and Tiny Service, and
   automatically generate their detection algorithms. We apply and validate
   the detection algorithms in terms of precision and recall two systems
   developed independently, (1) Home-Automation, an SBS with 13 services,
   and (2) FraSCAti, an open-source implementation of the Service Component
   Architecture (SCA) standard with more than 100 services. This validation
   demonstrates that our approach enables the specification and detection
   of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) antipatterns with an average
   precision of 90\% and recall of 97.5\%.}},

Abstract = {{Microsimulation of urban systems evolution requires synthetic population
   as a key input. Currently, the focus is on treating synthesis as a
   fitting problem and thus various techniques have been developed,
   including Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) and Combinatorial
   Optimization based techniques. The key shortcomings of these procedures
   include: (a) fitting of one contingency table, while there may be other
   solutions matching the available data (b) due to cloning rather than
   true synthesis of the population, losing the heterogeneity that may not
   have been captured in the microdata (c) over reliance on the accuracy of
   the data to determine the cloning weights (d) poor scalability with
   respect to the increase in number of attributes of the synthesized
   agents. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we propose a Markov
   Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation based approach. Partial views of the
   joint distribution of agent's attributes that are available from various
   data sources can be used to simulate draws from the original
   distribution. The real population from Swiss census is used to compare
   the performance of simulation based synthesis with the standard IPF. The
   standard root mean square error statistics indicated that even the worst
   case simulation based synthesis (SRMSE = 0.35) outperformed the best
   case IPF synthesis (SRMSE = 0.64). We also used this methodology to
   generate the synthetic population for Brussels, Belgium where the data
   availability was highly limited. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Summer methane fluxes from a boreal bog in northern Quebec, Canada,
   using eddy covariance measurements}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{464-474}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A boreal bog located in the James Bay lowlands, Canada, was instrumented
   with an open-path gas analyzer to monitor the turbulent fluxes of
   methane throughout the summer of 2012. The mostly continuous eddy
   covariance measurements permitted the study of methane dynamics at the
   hourly, daily and seasonal scales. To exclude data segments for which
   the biological methane fluxes were underestimated due to inefficient
   atmospheric transport under stable stratification, we applied a novel
   approach based on both the atmospheric stability parameter zeta = z/L
   and the friction velocity u{*}, where z is the measurement height and L
   the Obukhov length. The field measurements revealed the existence of at
   least one sustained ebullition event, triggered by low barometric
   pressures, a declining water table and increasing mechanical turbulence
   - suggesting that large-scale release of methane bubbles can be an
   important transport mechanism of methane in boreal bogs. The validity of
   similarity scaling for atmospheric methane under convective conditions
   was also assessed and the normalized standard deviations of methane
   concentrations did not scale well with C, highlighting the heterogeneity
   in natural methane production and release across the bog. Overall the
   hourly emissions ranged between -2.0 and 32.1 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1), with a
   summertime mean of 2A mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1). At the daily scale, the two
   main controls on methane emissions were found to be the water table
   position and the peat temperature at 03 m under the surface. Contrary to
   other studies, seasonal methane emissions peaked when the water table
   was at its maximum distance from the surface, around mid-August. No
   clear diurnal pattern could be found in methane emissions, indicating
   that methane was produced quite deep within the peat. The seasonal
   emissions were estimated at 4.4 g CH4 m(-2), and compared well with
   other observations over similar landscapes using different measurement
   techniques. Given that methane releases and transport are greatly
   affected by local characteristics such as climate and vegetative cover,
   this study emphasizes the need for further in situ continuous
   measurements of methane fluxes across northern peatlands. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{A mixture of modes is considered a key element towards sustainable
   transportation. New technologies that provide information about various
   modes and environments can help to inform choices regarding travel and
   accessibility. In this paper we describe the development of a web-based
   accessibility calculator prototype for the Greater Montreal Area in
   Canada. The core of this tool is a statistical model of trip length
   developed using the spatial expansion method. The model is used to
   obtain estimates of trip length for a desired profile, based on
   attributes such as age, gender, family structure, and mode of travel, as
   well as geographical location. These estimates are used to calculate a
   cumulative opportunities accessibility measure to different types of
   essential destinations. Travel behavior information is drawn from
   Montreal's 2008 Household Travel Surveys. Geocoded information about
   trip origins and destinations is used to calculate trip length. A broad
   array of covariates related to individual and household attributes, and
   urban form are used. A geocoded business point database is used for the
   calculation of cumulative opportunities. To simplify the use of the
   accessibility calculator, the model is implemented in a user-friendly
   way using Google Maps API v3 and a convenient interface. Different
   possible uses of the accessibility calculator are illustrated in the
   paper. The accessibility calculator can be used by members of the public
   or planners/policy makers to measure the level of accessibility for a
   specific address and personal profile by various modes of
   transportation. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Effect of plant species on sludge dewatering and fate of pollutants in
   sludge treatment wetlands}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{B}},
Pages = {{593-600}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Plants are assumed to play a central role in sludge treatment wetlands
   (STWs) by preventing clogging, favouring dewatering and improving sludge
   mineralisation. However, few comparative studies have been made to
   assess the influence of plants presence or species on the treatment of
   sludge in STWs. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the
   effect of three plant species on sludge dewatering and mineralisation,
   and on the general fate of water and pollutants in STWs. The
   experimental setup consisted of mesocosm sized STWs planted with
   monocultures of Phragmites australis, Typha angustifolia and Scirpus
   fluviatilis, in addition to an unplanted control, each in duplicate. The
   mesocosms were fed with settled fish farm sludge for three summers, and
   the effect of plants was assessed according to the percentage of
   pollutants per mass of dry sludge (pollutant content), in addition to a
   mass balance analysis of pollutants in the STWs.
   Results revealed that the standard method for assessing STW efficiency
   (i.e. sludge pollutants content) is inadequate when comparing the subtle
   effect of plant species and that a mass balance analysis should be used
   instead. Mass balance showed that pollutants were mainly retained within
   the sludge cake, while the rest was considered trapped inside the STWs
   or mineralised. Only a small percentage of pollutants was discharged at
   the effluent (from <0.1\% to 5\% of total pollutants input). Plant
   species had a distinct effect on pollutants, which differed according to
   the sampling location in the STWs. At the outlet, pollutant removal was
   more efficient in the planted system and was significantly different
   according to plant species. In the sludge cake, contrary to common
   assumptions, STWs planted with T. angustifolia and S. fluviatilis had
   generally higher sludge cake volume, mass of organic matter, nitrogen
   and phosphorus, when compared to the unplanted control. This was
   attributed to the presence of plant litter in the sludge cake, which
   mitigated mineralisation. In contrast, STWs planted with P. australis
   resulted in the highest reduction in sludge volume and were the most
   efficient for sludge dewatering and mineralisation of organic matter in
   comparison to other species and the unplanted control. A fraction of the
   nitrogen and phosphorus was also sequestered in plant tissues, which
   represented close to a quarter of the nitrogen input by the sludge in P.
   australis STWs. This study shows that the presence of plants and the
   choice of plant species is an important factor that affects sludge
   dewatering and mineralisation, but also the general fate of water and
   pollutants in STWs. Further studies should be done in a full size STW to
   validate the finding obtained in this mesocosm experiment. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{In this paper, analyses of photovoltaic (PV) and photovoltaic/thermal
   (PV/T) systems, based on the exergy method are presented. To this aim,
   explicit electrical and thermal models are developed and used to
   characterize each system. Furthermore, energy and exergy balances are
   combined in order to identify the different sources of exergy losses
   involved in both thermal and electrical energy fluxes. Electrical
   current and voltage reduction factors are defined and used to express
   the exergy as well as its destruction in PV/T system, while two
   thermodynamic diagrams are proposed to visualize these losses. The first
   one illustrates exergies expended, produced and destroyed during the
   conversion of solar radiation. The second one allows individual effects
   of both electrical potential and current losses to be explicitly
   revealed. The proposed methodology is applied to study a PV/T system
   operating under different environmental conditions, i.e., solar
   intensity and ambient temperature, where irreversibility in addition to
   energy and exergy efficiencies are calculated and analyzed. (C) 2013

Title = {{Thermal capacity effects in borehole ground heat exchangers}},
Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{352-364}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A one-dimensional transient ground heat exchanger model is proposed to
   account for fluid and grout thermal capacities in borehole ground heat
   exchangers with the objective of predicting the outlet fluid temperature
   for varying inlet temperature and flow rate. The standard two-pipe
   configuration is replaced with an equivalent geometry consisting of a
   single pipe and a cylinder core filled with grout. Transient radial heat
   transfer in the grout is solved numerically while the ground outside the
   borehole is treated analytically using the cylindrical heat source
   method. The proposed model is validated successfully against analytical
   solutions, experimental data, a three-dimensional transient numerical
   model, and TRNSYS's Type 451.
   For a typical two-pipe configuration, it is shown that the fluid outlet
   temperature predicted with and without borehole thermal capacity differs
   by 1.4, 0.35, and 0.23 degrees C after 0.1, 0.2 and 1 h, respectively.
   Annual simulations are also performed over an entire heating season
   (5600 h) with a 6 min time step. Results show that the outlet fluid
   temperature is always higher when borehole thermal capacity is included.
   Furthermore, the difference in fluid outlet temperature prediction with
   and without borehole thermal capacity increases when the heat pump
   operates infrequently. The end result is that the annual COP predicted
   is approximately 4.5\% higher when borehole thermal capacity is
   included. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel resonator method is presented to extract the attenuation

   attenuation constant of the SIW transmission line and the
   unloaded-factor of SIW cavity resonator at its resonant frequency. Thus,
   the attenuation constant of SIW transmission line can be extracted using
   SIW cavity resonator. Good agreement between the resonator method and
   Thru-Line (TL) method has been achieved in both full-wave simulation and
   experimental results. Besides, good robustness of the resonator method
   has been demonstrated, suggesting it is a promising technique for

Abstract = {{This paper explores new connections between the satisfiability problem
   and semidefinite programming. We show how the process of resolution in
   satisfiability is equivalent to a linear transformation between the

   this transformation semidefinite programming resolution, and we
   demonstrate the potential of this novel concept by using it to obtain a
   direct proof of the exactness of the semidefinite formulation of
   satisfiability without applying Lasserre's general theory for
   semidefinite relaxations of 0/1 problems. In particular, our proof
   explicitly shows how the exactness of the semidefinite formulation for
   any satisfiability formula can be interpreted as the implicit
   application of a finite sequence of resolution steps to verify whether
   the empty clause can be derived from the given formula. (C) 2013

   design of microwave dispersive delay structures (DDSs). DDSs are
   components providing specified group delay versus frequency responses

   formed by cascaded coupled C-sections. It is first shown that aggressive
   space mapping does not provide sufficient accuracy in the synthesis of

   technique. Compared to aggressive space mapping, this technique provides
   enhanced accuracy, while compared to output space mapping, it provides
   greater implementation simplicity. Two full-wave and one experimental
   examples are provided to illustrate the proposed predistortion space

Abstract = {{In many cases, model validation requires that legacy data be partitioned
   into calibration and validation sets, but how to do so is a nontrivial
   and open area of research. We present a systematic procedure to
   partition the data, adapted from cross-validation and in the context of
   predictive modeling. By considering all possible partitions, we proceed
   with post-processing steps to find the optimal partition of the data
   subject to given constraints. We are concerned here with mathematical
   models of physical systems whose predictions of a given unobservable
   quantity of interest are the basis for critical decisions. Thus, the
   proposed approach addresses two critical issues: (1) that the model be
   evaluated with respect to its ability to reproduce the data and (2) that
   the model be highly challenged by the validation set with respect to
   predictions of the quantity of interest. This framework also relies on
   the interaction between the experimentalist and/or modeler, who
   understand the physical system and the limitations of the model; the
   decision-maker, who understands and can quantify the cost of model
   failure; and the computational scientists, who strive to determine if
   the model satisfies both the modeler's and decision-maker's
   requirements. The framework is general and may be applied to a wide
   range of problems. It is illustrated here through an example using
   generated experiments of a nonlinear one degree-of-freedom oscillator.

Abstract = {{Bit-width allocation has a crucial impact on hardware efficiency and
   accuracy of fixed-point arithmetic circuits. This paper introduces a new
   accuracy-guaranteed word-length optimization approach for feed-forward

   well-known analytical technique, for both range and precision analyses.
   This paper introduces an acceleration technique and two new
   semianalytical algorithms for precision analysis. While the first
   algorithm follows a progressive search strategy, the second one uses a
   tree-shaped search method for fractional width optimization. The
   algorithms offer two different time-complexity/cost efficiency
   tradeoffs. The first algorithm has polynomial complexity and achieves
   comparable results with existing heuristic approaches. The second
   algorithm has exponential complexity, but it achieves near-optimal
   results compared to the exhaustive search method. A commonly used set of
   case studies is used to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed
   techniques and algorithms in terms of optimization time and hardware
   cost. The first and second algorithms achieve 10.9\% and 13.1\%
   improvements in area, respectively, over uniform fractional width
   allocation. The proposed acceleration technique reduces the complexity
   of the fractional width selection problem by an average of 20.3\%.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a parametric model to study the transient bending
   wave propagation in a viscoelastic sandwich plate due to impact loading.
   The effect of partial constrained layer damping (PCLD) geometry on wave
   propagation is investigated by comparing with propagation in single
   layer elastic plate. Several boundary conditions are also considered,
   and their effect on wave propagation is highlighted.
   The equation of motion is obtained from Lagrange's equations. For the
   single layer plate, the governing equation is solved in time domain
   using Newman and Wilson method. For the plate with PCLD, the frequency
   dependant viscoelastic behavior of the core is represented by Prony
   series; the equation of motion is converted into frequency domain using
   Fourier transform the displacement is obtained in the frequency domain
   and is converted into time domain with the Inverse Fast Fourier
   Transform.
   The model was validated in our previous paper (Khalfi and Ross (2013))
   with experimental results, additional validation is carried in this
   paper with literature, and good agreement is recorded. The results show
   that the plate covered with PCLD remains a dispersive medium. The shape
   of the wave is mainly related to the sandwich stiffness while the
   viscoelastic layer contributes in reducing the amplitude and speed of
   propagation. The particularity of this transient model lies in its
   ability to follow the shape of the bending wave at all times to observe
   formation, propagation and disappearance. With this model, the influence
   of any structural input parameters on the bending wave can be studied.
   The findings presented will also serve as a research base for more
   advanced horizons. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Trip assignment is still a modelling and prediction challenge. For
   aggregate analyses, it may suffice to use traditional trip assignment
   approaches. However, investigations of drivers' choices with respect to
   network infrastructure changes require disaggregate and behavioural
   approaches. It is often crucial to investigate the effects of critical
   infrastructure elements in the network on drivers' route choice
   behaviour. The case of Montreal is of particular interest because the
   city, an island, is completely separated from the rest of the region by
   two important rivers. Consequently, drivers have to select one of the
   available bridges to reach their destination. A large-scale travel
   survey conducted in Montreal in 2008 is used for empirical
   investigations. It is a one-day trip diary of approximately 4\% of the
   city's population and includes the bridge chosen in the itinerary for
   car driver trips. An advanced discrete choice model that jointly models
   choice set formation and final choice is then formulated and estimated
   using the observed trips. The empirical model correctly identifies the
   effects of travel time interacting with time of day and destination trip
   purpose. Empirical results show that age, gender and household auto
   ownership explain the variation of scale parameters of route/bridge
   choice. A discussion of the model's performance is provided along with
   further result analysis and perspectives for further work. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel stereo method for registering

   close-range scenes. In our stereo matching, we use Local Self-Similarity
   (LSS) as similarity metric between thermal and visible images. In order
   to accurately assign disparities to depth discontinuities and occluded
   Region Of Interest (ROI), we have integrated color and motion cues as
   soft constraints in an energy minimization framework. The optimal
   disparity map is approximated for image ROIs using a Belief Propagation
   (BP) algorithm. We tested our registration method on several challenging
   close-range indoor video frames of multiple people at different depths,
   with different clothing, and different poses. We show that our global
   optimization algorithm significantly outperforms the existing
   state-of-the art method, especially for disparity assignment of occluded
   people at different depth in close-range surveillance scenes and for
   relatively large camera baseline. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Enhanced equilibrium distribution functions for simulating immiscible
   multiphase flows with variable density ratios in a class of lattice
   Boltzmann models}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIPHASE FLOW}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{57}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This research examines the behavior of a class of lattice Boltzmann (LB)
   models designed to simulate immiscible multiphase flows. There is some
   debate in the scientific literature as to whether or not the ``color
   gradient{''} models, also known as the Rothman-Keller (RK) models, are
   able to simulate flow with density variation. In this paper, we show
   that it is possible, by modifying the original equilibrium distribution
   functions, to capture the discontinuity present in the analytical
   momentum profile of the two-layered Couette flow with variable density
   ratios. Investigations carried out earlier were not able to simulate
   such a flow correctly. Now, with the proposed approach, the new scheme
   is compatible with the analytical solution, and it is also possible to
   simulate the two-layered Couette flow with simultaneous density ratios
   of 0(1000) and viscosity ratios of 0(100). To test the model in a more
   complex flow situation, i.e. with non-zero surface tension and a curved
   interface, an unsteady simulation of an oscillating bubble with variable
   density ratio is undertaken. The numerical frequency of the bubble is
   compared to that of the analytical frequency. It is demonstrated that
   the proposed modification greatly increases the accuracy of the model
   compared to the original model, i.e. the error can be up to one order of
   magnitude lower with the proposed enhanced equilibrium distribution
   functions. The authors believe that this improvement can be made to
   other RK models as well, which will allow the range of validity of these
   models to be extended. This is, in fact, what the authors found for the
   method proposed in this article. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The first-melting projection of the phase diagram of a ternary or
   higher-order system shows the temperature at which a liquid phase first
   appears upon heating at any given composition in a system at
   thermodynamic equilibrium. In most systems, first-melting projections
   are identical to solidus projections. It is shown that they obey the
   same well-known topological rules as isothermal sections of phase
   diagrams. Hence, their interpretation is straightforward. Only in
   systems with catatectic invariants or retrograde solid solubility do
   exceptions to these rules occur, and then only over limited composition
   regions. In these regions the first-melting and solidus projections are
   not identical. In such cases it is preferable to plot the first-melting
   projection which is always single-valued at all compositions. A general
   algorithm for calculating first-melting projections thermodynamically is
   outlined. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a decentralized self-adjusting reactive power
   controller for the autonomous operation of a multi-bus medium voltage
   (MV) microgrid. The main objective of the proposed control strategy of
   each distributed generation (DG) unit is to compensate the reactive
   power of its local loads and to share the reactive power of the nonlocal
   loads among itself and other DG units. The proposed control strategy
   includes an improved droop controller whose parameters are adjusted
   according to the reactive power of the local loads. A virtual inductive
   impedance loop is augmented to the voltage controller to enhance the
   steady state and transient responses of the proposed reactive power
   management scheme. The small signal analysis of the proposed method is
   presented to ensure stability of the system for different reactive power
   values. The presented strategy considerably enhances the voltage
   profiles of the microgrid buses as compared with the conventional droop
   methods. The proposed method does not require any communication link and
   minimizes the reactive power flow in the MV lines, thus reducing the
   losses of the overall microgrid. The performance of the proposed control
   scheme is verified by using digital time-domain simulation studies in
   the PSCAD/EMTDC software environment.}},

Title = {{Interfacial coarsening of ternary polymer blends with partial and
   complete wetting structures}},
Journal = {{POLYMER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{25}},
Pages = {{6739-6751}},
Month = {{NOV 27}},
Abstract = {{The coarsening of polymer mixtures is an important route towards major
   morphology modification in multiphase polymer systems. To date however
   the coarsening of ternary systems has not been significantly examined.
   In this study the phase coarsening mechanism via annealing for partial
   wetting, and complete wetting morphologies in ternary polymer blends is
   characterized. This is a route towards the examination of interfacial
   coarsening in polymer blends since ternary partially wet systems involve
   the presence of interfacial droplets while completely wet ternary
   systems are comprised of a complete interfacial layer. A partial wetting
   type of morphology is obtained for polybutylene succinate
   (PBS)/poly(lactic acid) (PLA)/polycaprolactone (PCL). Three different
   compositions for that system with composition ratios of phi((PBS/PLA)) =
   1.5; phi((PBS/PLA)) = 3; and phi((PBS/PLA)) = 10 are prepared to show
   the effect of the concentration of the self-assembled PLA droplets
   located at the interface of PBS/PCL As the concentration of PLA
   decreases, the growth rate of the PLA phase during the annealing process
   sharply decreases due to a significant increase of the ``surface to
   volume ratio{''} of the PLA droplets required in order to cover the
   interface. In this case, due to the short inter-droplet distances
   between PLA droplets at the interface, coalescence is controlled by the
   drainage time. This mechanism is confirmed by the observation of a
   linear relationship between the third power of droplet size and
   annealing time. For the 37.5\%PBS/12.5\%PLA/50\%PCL blend, the
   conservation of interfacial-angles confirms that the annealing time has
   no effect on the angle values between phases, as predicted by Harkins
   spreading theory.
   The annealing process for complete wetting is studied at four
   compositions for an HDPE/PS/PCL blend where the PS phase is located as a
   continuous layer at the interface of co-continuous HDPE/PCL. In 33.3\%
   HDPE/33.3\%PS/33.3\%PCL after 30 min of annealing, the PS phase
   thickness increases 49 times from 2.3 mu m to 112 mu m. Even for very
   low concentrations of 3\%PS, a high coarsening rate of 0.0039 mu m/s is
   observed. This sharp linear increase in PS phase size implies a
   capillary pressure mechanism and an impeded growth of Tomotika-like
   capillaries for all three phases that cause a confinement effect for
   coarsening of the middle PS phase. (C)2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{In order to assess the material loss mechanisms of monolithic coatings
   subjected to solid particle erosion (SPE) using angular alumina
   particles with relatively low velocities (<100 m/s), we studied the
   erosion behavior of several hard coatings deposited by pulsed DC
   magnetron sputtering. We first validated a new methodology for the
   measurement of volume loss and optimized the testing conditions to
   obtain a measured erosion rate (ER) free from experimental artifacts. We
   then correlated the measured ERs to the mechanical properties, measured
   by depth sensing indentation, and found that the ER was strongly
   dependent on the target hardness (H-t) of the materials (ER proportional
   to H-t(-6.8 +/- 0.5)). In order to understand the material loss
   mechanisms, we studied three coating systems in greater detail with the
   help of fracture characterization and a morphological study of the
   eroded surfaces. It was found that fracture toughness was not a good
   predictor of ER and that the material removal was the result of ductile
   indentation and cutting. Finally, in an effort to understand the role of
   particle fracture, we measured the particle size distributions of the
   powders before and after erosion testing and found that particle breakup
   was proportional to the target hardness but not sufficiently large to
   explain the large drop in ERs with increasing H-t. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In a recent paper, Anthony et al. {[}Opt. Express 21, 2903 ( 2013)]
   demonstrated broadband terahertz pulse propagation through the hollow
   core fibers with two embedded Indium wires. In another paper by A.
   Markov et al. {[}Opt. Express 21, 12728 ( 2013)], we proposed a
   plasmonic THz fiber featuring two metallic wires held in place by the
   porous dielectric cladding functioning as a mechanical support. Although
   the cross sections of the two waveguides look very similar, we were
   surprised to find that the guidance mechanisms for these two waveguides
   are quite different. In fact, waveguide considered by A. Markov et al.
   was guiding a plasmonic mode, while the waveguide presented by Anthony
   et al. was guiding a dielectric waveguide-like mode. Finally, we have
   realized that by reducing the waveguide dimensions by a factor of
   similar to 10-20 one can transition from the dielectric waveguide
   guidance as it is demonstrated by Anthony et al. to plasmonic guidance
   as reported in A. Markov et al. Therefore, we conclude that both
   waveguide are essentially identical, while their guidance mechanism
   changes as a function of the waveguide overall size. (C) 2013 Optical

Abstract = {{Our study assessed the impact of hazelnuts (Coryllus avellena L) in
   land-use conversion from forest (F) to agricultural land (AL) on various
   attributes of soil respiration dynamics, such as soil elemental carbon
   (C \%) content, microbial respiration, bulk density, soil pH, electrical
   conductivity, and seasonal variations. We developed soil C\% models to
   compare soil C\% between F and AL soils. Four field trips were conducted
   in the winter and summer of 2008 and the spring and fall of 2009 in the
   Karasu region of Turkey. During each trip, 42 sites were visited F (n =
   21) and AL (n = 21). Our results showed that hazelnuts plantations in AL
   could reduce elemental C\% by 27\% (winter 2008), 16\% (summer 2008),
   41\% (spring 2009), and 22\% (fall 2009) in the four seasons studied
   when compared to F soils. In situ soil respiration was also reduced by
   31\% (spring 2008), 67\% (fall 2008), 88\% (spring 2009), and 79\% (fall
   2009) in AL soils over F soils. The percent of organic matter of AL
   soils was declined by 36\% (winter 2008), 23\% (summer 2008), 34\%
   (spring 2009), and 26\% (fall 2009) in comparison to F soils.
   Significant reductions in the correlation between C \%-percent clay and
   C\%-electrical conductivity were also recorded for AL soils over F
   soils. Furthermore, AL soils showed higher bulk density (7.4\% and 7\%)
   when compared to F soils. We also found that in situ soil respiration
   had significant seasonal correlations (p < 0.05) with soil pH (0.537),
   soil temperature, and percent clay (-0.486) in F soils (summer 2008,
   spring 2009). Additionally, we found that seasonal variations of four
   sampling seasons had a moderate impact on in situ respiration and that
   the differences were statistically significant, except for the
   winter-summer and spring-fall seasonal pairs. Linear regression C models
   showed significant differences for F and AL soils. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We present a novel optical fiber surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor
   scheme using reflected guided cladding modes captured by a double-clad
   fiber coupler and excited in a gold-coated fiber with a tilted Bragg

   spectrum, provides an improvement in the operating range of the device
   over previous techniques. The device allows detection of SPR in the
   reflected guided cladding modes and also in the transmitted spectrum,
   allowing comparison with standard techniques. The sensor has a large
   operating range from 1.335 to 1.432 RIU, and a sensitivity of 510.5
   nm/RIU. The device shows strong dependence on the polarization state of
   the guided core mode which can be used to turn the SPR on or off. (C)

Volume = {{253}},
Pages = {{471-490}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a computationally-efficient algorithm for generating
   random periodic packings of hard ellipsoids. The algorithm is based on
   molecular dynamics where the ellipsoids are set in translational and
   rotational motion and their volumes gradually increase. Binary collision
   times are computed by simply finding the roots of a non-linear function.
   In addition, an original and efficient method to compute the collision
   time between an ellipsoid and a cube face is proposed. The algorithm can
   generate all types of ellipsoids (prolate, oblate and scalene) with very
   high aspect ratios (i.e., > 10). It is the first time that such packings
   are reported in the literature. Orientations tensors were computed for
   the generated packings and it has been shown that ellipsoids had a
   uniform distribution of orientations. Moreover, it seems that for low
   aspect ratios (i.e., <= 10), the volume fraction is the most influential
   parameter on the algorithm CPU time. For higher aspect ratios, the
   influence of the latter becomes as important as the volume fraction. All
   necessary pseudo-codes are given so that the reader can easily implement
   the algorithm. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Two hundred fifty Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolates were studied
   to determine their susceptibilities to beta-lactam antibiotics. Among
   these isolates, 16 were methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), 207 were
   methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and 27 were borderline
   oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (BORSA). Currently, the reported mechanism
   of methicillin resistance in S. aureus is the production of a
   distinctive penicillin binding protein 2a (PBP2a), which exhibits low
   affinity toward beta-lactams. A surface plasmon resonance biosensor was
   evaluated for its ability to identify MRSA and to distinguish these
   strains from MSSA and BORSA, by specifically detecting PBP2a. We found
   that the system permits label-free, real-time, specific detection of
   pathogens for concentrations as low as 10 colony forming
   units/milliliter (CFU/ml), in less than 20 min. This system promises to
   become a diagnostic tool for bacteria that cause major public concern in
   clinical settings. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we investigated the effect of four different
   configurations at the exit of a single-screw extruder on the induction
   of beta phase in PP for four different rotational speeds. The
   configuration of a breaker plate with 120 orifices of 1-mm diameter and
   7-mm length each, give the highest content of beta-phase (56.92\%), for
   a screw rotational speed of 20 rpm. It was due to the shear caused
   separation of the melt when it passes through the orifices of the
   breaker plate. The breaker plate of configuration 4 (breaker plate with
   the greatest number of orifices) provided the largest number of contacts
   between the melt and the orifice walls resulting in chain alignment. The
   results show that the beta-phase can be induced in the polymer without
   any further additives, especially without any nucleating agents, but
   rather by using a special breaker plate configuration at the exit of the
   single-screw extruder. The skin-core structure of the polymer was only
   developed with one type of extruder configuration. (c) 2013 Wiley

Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to evaluate the use of passive bioreactors to
   reduce water-borne plant pathogens (Pythium ultimum and Fusarium
   oxysporum) and nutrient load (NO- (3) and SO2- (4)) in greenhouse
   effluent. Sterilized and unsterilized passive bioreactors filled with a
   reactive mixture of organic carbon material were used in three
   replicates. After a startup period of 2 (sterilized) or 5 (unsterilized)
   weeks, the bioreactor units received for 14 weeks a reconstituted
   commercial greenhouse effluent composed of 500mg L-1 SO2- (4) and 300mg
   L-1 NO- (3) and were inoculated three times with P. ultimum and F.
   oxysporum (10(6) CFU mL(-1)). Efficacy in removing water-borne plant
   pathogens and nitrate reached 99.9\% for both the sterilized and
   unsterilized bioreactors. However, efficacy in reducing the SO2- (4)
   load sharply decreased from 89\% to 29\% after 2 weeks of NO- (3)-supply
   treatment for the unsterilized bioreactors. Although SO2- (4) removal
   efficacy for the sterilized bioreactors did not recover after 4 weeks of
   NO- (3)-supply treatment, the unsterilized bioreactor nearly reached a
   similar level of SO2- (4) removal after 4 weeks of NO- (3)-supply
   treatment compared with affluent loaded only with SO2- (4), where no
   competition for the carbohydrate source occurred between the
   denitrification process and sulfate-reducing bacteria activity.
   Performance differences between the sterilized and unsterilized
   bioreactors clearly show the predominant importance of sulfate-reducing
   bacteria. Consequently, when sulfate-reducing bacteria reach their
   optimal activity, passive bioreactors may constitute a cheap,
   low-maintenance method of treating greenhouse effluent to recycle
   wastewater and eliminate nutrient runoff, which has important
   environmental impacts.}},

Abstract = {{A far-field drag prediction and decomposition method has been applied to
   the results of the AIAA Drag Prediction Workshop 5 held in Louisiana
   during the summer of 2012. The method has two principal advantages: it
   allows the removal of spurious drag inherent to computational fluid
   dynamics solutions, and it allows the decomposition of drag into
   viscous, wave, and induced physical drag components. This research shows
   that accurate drag coefficients can be predicted on coarse grids when
   the spurious drag is extracted with the far-field method and that these
   results are closer to experimental values than drag coefficients
   computed on finer meshes when spurious drag is not extracted. The
   research also investigated the reasons behind the lift and drag losses
   found by some participants in the workshop. It is shown that the lift
   loss is caused by the boundary-layer separation at the wing root,
   inducing a reduction of 20\% of the shock wave drag and a significant
   change in the wing loading. The initiation of buffet is also analyzed.
   The study shows that mesh refinement is critical to capture the physical
   effects of the flow, such as its separation, and provides an explanation
   of the discrepancies in results observed at the Drag Prediction Workshop

   possible resistance. What is the potential involved in such
   optimization? It is often suggested that it is entropy or entropy

   understand by a mesoscopic entropy of externally driven systems and how

   between the chitosan particles and A549 human epithelial cells, which
   demonstrated that the modifications incurred on sterilization are

Abstract = {{Two similar code segments, or clones, form a clone pair within a
   software system. The changes to the clones over time create a clone
   evolution history. In this work, we study late propagation, a specific
   pattern of clone evolution. In late propagation, one clone in a clone
   pair is modified, causing the clone pair to diverge. The code segments
   are then reconciled in a later commit. Existing work has established
   late propagation as a clone evolution pattern and suggested that the
   pattern is related to a high number of faults. In this study, we examine
   the characteristics of late propagation in three long-lived software
   systems using the Simian ( Simon Harris, Victoria, Australia,
   http://www.harukizaemon.com/simian), CCFinder, and NiCad (Software
   Technology Laboratory, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada) clone
   detection tools. We define eight types of late propagation and compare
   them to other forms of clone evolution. Our results not only verify that
   late propagation is more harmful to software systems but also establish
   that some specific types of late propagations are more harmful than
   others. Specifically, two types are most risky: (1) when a clone
   experiences diverging changes and then a reconciling change without any
   modification to the other clone in a clone pair; and (2) when two clones
   undergo a diverging modification followed by a reconciling change that
   modifies both the clones in a clone pair. We also observe that the
   reconciliation in the former case is more prone to faults than in the
   latter case. We determine that the size of the clones experiencing late
   propagation has an effect on the fault proneness of specific types of
   late propagation genealogies. Lastly, we cannot report a correlation
   between the delay of the propagation of changes and its faults, as the
   fault proneness of each delay period is system dependent. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{In this study, a novel technique is presented to enable the
   characterization of the dimensional changes and evolution of mechanical
   properties of a resin during cure. This is achieved using an innovative
   in situ device called thermal flux cell combined with a Dynamical
   Mechanical thermal Analyser (DMA). With this system, it is now possible
   to eliminate the sources of error induced while combining two or more
   instruments. This device consists into a mold containing the resin where
   the upper and lower surfaces acting as heat flux sensors. Changes in
   temperature and thermal flux are directly monitored as well as the
   dynamical displacement and the stiffness during the curing process. In
   this work, an epoxy DGEBA resin was used to demonstrate the innovative
   approach. The tested resin was characterized using different vibration
   frequencies and amplitudes of the DMA. The results were then processed
   in order to provide accurate data on gel time and cure kinetics
   behavior. The volume and mechanical changes were also derived from
   experimental data and linked to the degree of cure. Chemo and
   thermo-mechanical models were created to predict the changes in chemical
   shrinkage and stiffness during cure. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, a substrate integrated waveguide power divider is
   proposed on the basis of a recombinant topology that provides in-phase
   power division with an odd or even number of branches. The aim is to
   generate different types of power distribution to control sidelobe level
   in the antenna array. In this study, several power-divider designs were
   designed to demonstrate and validate the design approach. Each design
   consists of a cascade of steps and nfurcations, which were initially
   designed based on sinusoidal basis functions. These designs were
   simulated using the High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) and shown
   to closely match the performance estimated using the basis functions. A
   substrate with thickness of 0.508 mm and dielectric constant of 2.94 is
   used. A three-way power divider with a binominal output taper is
   optimized and fabricated, showing good results in the bandwidth of
   interest from 72 to 81 GHz. Measurement results for a 3 x 8 slot array
   antenna designed in conjunction with the proposed feeding network are
   presented and discussed. This design can be used to build up rectangular
   waveguide structures. The novel structure is expected to be useful in
   building sub-arrays of antenna in the development of millimeter-wave

Abstract = {{Near-infrared (NIR)-to-NIR upconverting NaY(Gd)F-4:Tm3+,Yb3+
   paramagnetic nanoparticles (NPs) are efficiently detected by NIR imaging
   techniques. As they contain Gd3+ ions, they also provide efficient
   positive contrast in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Water-dispersible
   small (approximate to 25 nm, S-) and ultrasmall (<5 nm diam., US-)
   NaY(Gd)F-4:Tm3+,Yb3+ NPs are synthesized by thermal decomposition and
   capped with citrate. The surface of citrate-coated US-NPs shows sodium
   depletion and high Gd elemental ratios, as confirmed by a comparative
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)/neutron absorption analysis
   study. US-NaGd0.745F4:Tm-0.005,Y-b0.25 NPs have hydrodynamic diameters
   close to that measured by TEM, with the lowest relaxometric ratios
   (r(2)/r(1) = 1.18) reported for NaGdF4 nanoparticle suspensions (r(1) =
   3.37 mM(-1) s(-1) at 1.4 T and 37 degrees C). Strong relaxivity peaks in
   the range of 20 (0.47 T) - 300 MHz (7.05 T) are revealed in nuclear
   magnetic resonance dispersion profiles, with high r(2)/r(1) ratios at
   increasing field strengths for S-NPs. This indicates the superiority of
   US-NPs over S-NPs for achieving high positive contrast at clinical MRI
   field strengths. I.-v. injected citrate-coated US-NPs evidence long
   blood retention times (>90 min) in mice. Biodistribution studies (48 h,

Title = {{Very short-term effect of brace wearing on gait in adolescent idiopathic
   scoliosis girls}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN SPINE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2399-2406}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Adolescent idiopathic scoliotic (AIS) deformity induces excessive oxygen
   consumption correlated to a bilateral increase of lumbo-pelvic muscles
   timing activity (EMG) during gait. Wearing a brace, the usual treatment
   for AIS, by supporting the spine and the pelvis, would generate
   lumbo-pelvic muscular relaxation and consequently reduce excessive
   oxygen consumption. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the
   short-term effect of bracing on gait biomechanics in scoliotic spine
   when compared with normal braced spine.
   Thirteen healthy volunteers were compared to 13 AIS girls. In both
   samples, gait analysis was assessed using a three-dimensional motion
   analysis, including synchronous kinematic, electromyographic, mechanical
   and energy measurements, first without brace, then wearing a brace.
   For scoliotic patients, comparison of in-brace and out-brace situations
   revealed a significant decrease of frontal pelvis (p < 0.001), hip (p <
   0.001) and shoulder (p = 0.004) motion in brace associated with a
   significant reduction of pelvis rotation (p = 0.003). However, the brace
   did not change significantly the lumbo-pelvic muscle activity duration
   (EMG) or the mechanical and energetic parameters. Transversal pelvis
   motion was reduced by 39 \% (p = 0.04), frontal hip and shoulder motions
   by 23 \% (p = 0.004) and 30 \% (p = 0.01) respectively, and energy cost
   of walking remained increased by 37 \% in braced AIS girls relatively to
   braced healthy subjects. Mechanical and electromyographic variables were
   not significantly different between the two braced populations during
   gait except for the gluteus medius muscle that showed bilaterally an
   increase of duration of electrical activity in healthy subjects and
   contrarily a decrease in AIS patients (healthy: -3.5 +/- A 9.6 \% of
   gait cycle vs. scoliotic: 3.7 +/- A 7.7 \% of gait cycle; p = 0.04).
   Bracing changed neither the oxygen consumption nor the timing of the
   lumbo-pelvic muscles activity in both groups during gait. However, in
   brace the timing activity of bilateral gluteus medius muscles tended to
   decrease in AIS patients and increase in healthy subjects. Moreover,
   braced AIS patients had more restricted frontal hips and shoulder motion
   as well as pelvis rotation than braced healthy subjects.}},

Title = {{A study on heat transfer enhancement using flow channel inserts for
   thermoelectric power generation}},
Journal = {{ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{532-541}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Thermoelectric power production has many potential applications that
   range from microelectronics heat management to large scale industrial
   waste-heat recovery. A low thermoelectric conversion efficiency of the
   current state of the art prevents wide spread use of thermoelectric
   modules. The difficulties lie in material conversion efficiency, module
   design, and thermal system management. The present study investigates
   thermoelectric power improvement due to heat transfer enhancement at the
   channel walls of a liquid-to-liquid thermoelectric generator brought
   upon by flow turbulating inserts. Care is taken to measure the adverse
   pressure drop due to the presence of flow impeding obstacles in order to
   measure the net thermoelectric power enhancement relative to an absence
   of inserts. The results illustrate the power enhancement performance of
   three different geometric forms fitted into the channels of a
   thermoelectric generator. Spiral inserts are shown to offer a minimal
   improvement in thermoelectric power production whereas inserts with
   protruding panels are shown to be the most effective. Measurements of
   the thermal enhancement factor which represents the ratio of heat flux
   into heat flux out of a channel and numerical simulations of the
   internal flow velocity field attribute the thermal enhancement resulting
   in the thermoelectric power improvement to thermal and velocity field
   synergy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{935-944}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In confined aquifers, the influence of neighboring active wells is often
   neglected when interpreting a pumping test. This can, however, lead to
   an erroneous interpretation of the pumping test data. This paper
   presents simple methods to evaluate the transmissivity (T) and
   storativity (S) of a confined aquifer under Theis conditions, when an
   interfering well starts pumping in the neighborhood of the tested well
   before the beginning of the test. These new methods yield better
   estimates of the T and especially S values than when the interfering
   well influence is neglected. They also permit to distinguish between
   interfering wells and other deviations from the Cooper-Jacob straight
   line, such as impermeable boundaries. The new methods were then applied
   on data obtained from a numerical model. The new methods require knowing
   the pumping rate of the interfering well and the time elapsed since the
   pumping started in each well, but contrary to previous methods, they do
   not require the aquifer natural level at the beginning of the test,
   which is often unknown if the interfering well has started pumping
   before the tested well.}},

   Natural Seepage}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{960-967}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Closed-form solutions are proposed for natural seepage in semiconfined
   (leaky) aquifers such as those existing below the massive Champlain Sea
   clay layers in the Saint-Lawrence River Valley. The solutions are for an
   ideal horizontal leaky aquifer below an ideal aquitard that may have
   either a constant thickness and a constant hydraulic head at its
   surface, or a variable thickness and a variable hydraulic head at its
   surface. A few simplifying assumptions were needed to obtain the
   closed-form solutions. These have been verified using a finite element
   method, which did not make any of the assumptions but gave an excellent
   agreement for hydraulic heads and groundwater velocities. For example,
   the difference between the two solutions was smaller than 1 mm for
   variations in the 5 to 8 m range for the hydraulic head in the
   semiconfined aquifer. Note that fitting the hydraulic head data of
   monitoring wells to the theoretical solutions gives only the ratio of
   the aquifer and aquitard hydraulic conductivities, a clear case of
   multiple solutions for an inverse problem. Consequently, field
   permeability tests in the aquitard and the aquifer, and pumping tests in
   the aquifer, are still needed to determine the hydraulic conductivity
   values.}},

Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{In this communication, a new broadband antenna with a very low profile
   is proposed. The antenna inherits the wide bandwidth of the blade
   antenna, while its height is considerably reduced to 0.03 lambda(0),
   where lambda(0) is the wavelength of the lowest operating frequency.
   This new design consists of a top loaded monopole with several shorting
   pins and an inductive loading. The antenna resonates at two distinctive
   frequencies determined by the shorting pins and inductive loading and
   the wideband characteristic is achieved by the control of the resonance
   separations. The inductive loading is created by a shorted metallic disk
   embedded into the antenna structure. This newmethod of inductive loading
   facilitates the antenna fabrication while the physical size of the
   antenna is kept compact. A prototype was fabricated and its VSWR and far
   field radiation pattern were measured. The antenna provides a bandwidth
   of 17\% for VSWR smaller than 3. Also, a minimum realized gain of 1 dBi
   was achieved over the frequency bandwidth in which the antenna is well
   matched.}},

Abstract = {{The optical properties of a novel type of open waveguiding structure for
   surface plasmon-polaritons (SPPs) are experimentally investigated. The
   waveguide consists of a strip-like region of a gold surface confined by
   a periodic sequence of dielectric ridges forming a Bragg-type reflector.
   This bandgap structure resembles the plasmonic analogue of an
   antiresonant reflecting optical waveguide (ARROW) for SPPs, providing
   direct access to the guided plasmonic field. The main structural
   parameters are evaluated by numerical modeling using the finite element
   and finite-difference time-domain methods. We investigate field
   distributions of the plasmonic modes in the antiresonant Bragg-reflector
   waveguides with varied numbers of dielectric ridges and demonstrate a
   large mode-area single-mode performance at a telecom wavelength of 1550
   nm. Furthermore, for an excitation wavelength of 974 nm, it is shown
   that different low-order modes can be selectively excited using multiple
   laser beams with variable phase relation. Selective excitation of single
   longitudinal and transversal modes of the waveguide is realized by
   coherent two-beam excitation. Possible sensing applications of these
   large-mode open waveguides are discussed. (C) 2013 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{The need to target, deliver and subsequently evaluate the efficacy of
   therapeutics in the treatment of a disease has provided added impetus in
   developing novel and highly efficient contrast agents. Superparamagnetic
   iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) have offered tremendous potential in
   designing advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diagnostic agents,
   due to their unique physicochemical properties. There has been
   tremendous effort devoted in the recent past in developing synthetic
   methodologies through which their size, hydrodynamic radii, chemical
   composition and morphologies could be tailored at the nanoscale. This
   enables one to fine tune their magnetic behavior, and thus their MRI
   response. While novel synthetic strategies are being assembled for
   directing SPIONs to the diseased site as well as imparting them stealth
   and biocompatibility, it is also essential to evaluate their biological
   toxicological profiles. This review highlights recent advances that have
   been made in the synthesis of SPIONs, subsequent functionalization with
   desired entities, and a discussion on their use as MRI contrast agents

Abstract = {{Power consumption is a major concern for wireless sensor networks (WSNs)
   nodes, and it is often dominated by the power consumption of
   communication means. For such networks, devices are most of the time
   battery-powered and need to have very low power consumption. Moreover,
   for WSNs, limited amount of data are periodically sent and then the
   radio should be in idle or deep sleep mode most of the time. Thus using
   event-triggered radios is well suited and could lead to significant
   reduction of the overall power consumption of WSNs. Therefore this paper
   explores the design of an asynchronous module that can wake up the main
   receiver when another node is trying to send data. Furthermore, we
   implement the proposed solution in an FPGA to decrease the fabrication
   cost for low volume applications and make it easier to design, re-use
   and enhance. To decrease the static power consumption, we explore the
   possibility of reducing the supply voltage. The observed overall power
   consumption is under 5 mu W at 250 kbps. Moreover, using a new
   asynchronous design technique, we observed that power consumption can be
   further reduced.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a multiple-round timber auction simulation,
   developed in order to study various configurations of auction design. In
   this study, simultaneous sequential timber auctions are modelled and
   analysed using agent-based simulation technology. As there are many
   individual items in the auction to be sold, the auction designer defines
   several rounds that are sequential at pre-defined intervals. At each
   round, the auction designer announces several simultaneous auctions.
   Since bidders are offered different items at each round, a mathematical
   linear programing model for selecting the best set of items to bid for
   is presented. Different bidding patterns are simulated and compared in
   various setup configurations. The most advanced of these strategies are
   adaptive and use agent-learning capability. The comparisons include the
   success rate of winning the auction and the winning price per m(3). This
   study suggests an efficient bidding pattern for bidders to bid in order
   to achieve to their goal and increase their profit. Similarly, in order
   to increase profit, the auctioneer (i.e. the government) needs to
   control several auction parameters including the number of auctions per
   year, the lot size, the auction periodicity, and the number of bidders.
   This study also suggests parameters configurations that to maximise
   revenue for the auctioneer. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: A new technique called electroarthrography (EAG) measures
   electrical potentials on the surface of the knee during joint loading.
   The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of EAG to
   assess joint cartilage degeneration.
   Design: FAG recordings were performed on 20 asymptomatic subjects
   (Control group) and on 20 patients with bilateral knee osteoarthritis
   (OA) who had had a unilateral total knee replacement (TKR), both the TKR
   knee and the remaining knee were analyzed. EAG signals were recorded at
   eight electrode sites over one knee as the subjects shifted their weight
   from one leg to the other to achieve joint loading. The EAG signals were
   filtered, baseline-corrected and time-averaged.
   Results: EAG repeatability was assessed with a test-retest protocol
   which showed statistically significant high intraclass correlation
   coefficients (ICC) for four electrode sites near the joint line. These
   sites also showed the highest mean EAG values. The mean EAG potentials
   of the Control group were significantly higher compared with the OA
   group for three sites overlying the joint line. The potentials overlying
   the TKR were statistically nul. In the Control group, no statistically
   significant correlation was found between the EAG amplitude and age,
   weight, height or body mass index (BMI); no statistical difference was
   found in mean EAG potentials between women and men.
   Conclusions: This study indicates that EAG signals arise from the
   streaming potentials in compressed articular cartilage which are known
   sensitive indicators of joint cartilage health. EAG is a promising new
   technique for the non-invasive assessment of cartilage degeneration and
   arthritis. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of

Abstract = {{This study provides a general methodology to integrate LCA into a
   single- or multi-objective process design optimization context. It uses
   specific weightings for foreground emissions, for preventable background
   emissions and for unpreventable background emissions, for each impact
   category. It is illustrated for a natural gas combined cycle power plant
   with three scenarios to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions: CO2 capture
   and sequestration, fuel substitution with biogas or fuel substitution
   with synthetic gas from wood.
   Assuming that the opportunity to prevent emissions elsewhere is an
   implicit part of the process design decision space, the optimal solution
   cannot waste such opportunities and is shown to minimize total life
   cycle costs, including emission avoidance costs based on the optimal
   combination of prevention and compensation measures in the background
   system. In the case study, background emissions are inventoried from the
   ecoinvent database, their compensation costs are derived from the
   Ecocosts 2007 impact assessment method and their prevention costs are
   estimated from the literature. The calculated avoidance costs
   (weightings) then show how the background system affects the final
   choice of CO2 reduction scenario.
   In the case study, all three options partially shift environmental
   burdens to the background system, which can be prevented or compensated.
   The corresponding minimum avoidance cost is highest overall for the
   biogas option, thus putting it at a disadvantage. For a vast majority of
   ecoinvent processes, energy efficiency is important to minimize total
   avoidance costs because they are dominated by background CO2.
   Furthermore, prevention cost data gathering can be simplified in some
   cases, without distorting design decisions, using a CO2-only background
   inventory. The non-CO2 background inventory is more useful after process
   design, for procurement decisions.
   Over-investing in design modifications cannot achieve the same
   background impact reductions as a sensible green procurement policy.
   Thus, the proposed weighting methodology ensures that all types of
   design decisions integrate LCA without incorrectly assuming that
   emissions are necessarily unavoidable when in the background. Within a
   context of future emission taxes or tradable permits, the weightings can
   also anticipate the after-tax cost passed on by suppliers-a marketable
   benefit of LCA.
   Since many LCA studies are equivalent to design optimization problems,
   the proposed weighting methodology provides a single-score impact method
   relevant to decision-making as well as a straightforward approach to LCA
   interpretation in terms of detailing the optimal combination of
   applicable design modifications, prevention measures and compensation
   measures.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate numerical homogenization necessitates the thorough
   determination of the Representative Volume Element (RVE). There exists
   several seminal works on the notion of the RVE in homogenization, its
   definitions and methods of determination for efficient computation of
   composite effective properties. The objective of the current work is to
   assess the ability of numerical RVE determination methods to deliver
   accurate effective properties of composite materials. This paper
   demonstrates that common and well-established RVE determination methods,
   based on studying the convergence rate of the effective properties with
   respect to the volume element size, are invalid for the case of
   composites reinforced by randomly oriented fibers and yield erroneous
   estimates of their effective properties. Following the failure of
   traditional RVE determination methods, we proposed a new RVE
   determination criterion that is not based on the average property
   stability, but its statistical variations. Our new proposed criterion
   has been shown to be more accurate than other criteria in computing the
   effective properties of composites for aspect ratios up to 60. Moreover,
   the proposed criterion does not necessitate a convergence study over the
   volume element size, hence reducing considerably the RVE determination
   cost. Finally, our work questions the validity of many published works
   dealing with composites including heterogeneities of high aspect ratios.

Abstract = {{Scoliosis is a 3D deformity of the spine and rib cage. Extensive
   validation of 3D reconstruction methods of the spine from biplanar
   radiography has already been published. In this article, we propose a
   novel method to reconstruct the rib cage, using the same biplanar views
   as for the 3D reconstruction of the spine, to allow clinical assessment
   of whole trunk deformities. This technique uses a semi-automatic
   segmentation of the ribs in the postero-anterior X-ray view and an
   interactive segmentation of partial rib edges in the lateral view. The
   rib midlines are automatically extracted in 2D and reconstructed in 3D
   using the epipolar geometry. For the ribs not visible in the lateral
   view, the method predicts their 3D shape. The accuracy of the proposed
   method has been assessed using data obtained from a synthetic bone model
   as a gold standard and has also been evaluated using data of real
   patients with scoliotic deformities. Results show that the reconstructed
   ribs enable a reliable evaluation of the rib axial rotation, which will
   allow a 3D clinical assessment of the spine and rib cage deformities.

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of efficient routing in backbone
   wireless mesh networks (WMNs) where each mesh router is equipped with
   multiple radio interfaces and a subset of nodes serve as gateways to the
   Internet. Most routing schemes have been designed to reduce routing
   costs by optimizing one metric, e.g., hop count and interference ratio.
   However, when considering these metrics together, the complexity of the
   routing problem increases drastically. Thus, an efficient and adaptive
   routing scheme that takes into account several metrics simultaneously
   and considers traffic congestion around the gateways is needed. In this
   paper, we propose an adaptive scheme for routing traffic in WMNs, called
   Reinforcement Learning-based Distributed Routing (RLBDR), that (1)
   considers the critical areas around the gateways where mesh routers are
   much more likely to become congested and (2) adaptively learns an
   optimal routing policy taking into account multiple metrics, such as
   loss ratio, interference ratio, load at the gateways and end-to end
   delay. Simulation results show that RLBDR can significantly improve the
   overall network performance compared to schemes using either Metric of
   Interference and Channel switching, Best Path to Best Gateway, Expected
   Transmission count, nearest gateway (i.e., shortest path to gateway) or
   load at gateways as a metric for path selection.}},

Abstract = {{We describe, in this paper, a new digital input-output power
   configurable PAD (CPAD) for a wafer-scale-based rapid prototyping
   platform for electronic systems. This wafer-scale platform includes a
   reconfigurable wafer-scale circuit that can interconnect any digital
   components manually deposited on its active alignment-insensitive
   surface. The whole platform is powered using a massive grid of embedded
   voltage regulators. Power is fed from the bottom side of the wafer using
   through silicon vias. The CPAD can be configured to provide CMOS
   standard voltages of 1.0, 1.5, 1.8, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.3 V using a single
   3.3 V power supply. The digital I/O includes transistors sharing and is
   embedded within the regulation circuit by combining it with a turbo mode
   that insures high-speed operation. Fast load regulation is achieved with
   a 5.5-ns response time to a current step load for a maximum current of
   110 mA per CPAD. The proposed circuit architecture benefits from a
   hierarchical arborescence topology where one master stage drives 16
   CPADs with a very small quiescent current of 366 nA. The CPAD circuit
   and the master stage occupy a small area of 0.00847 and 0.00726 mm(2),
   respectively, in CMOS 0.18-mu m technology.}},

Title = {{Is lines of code a good measure of effort in effort-aware models?}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1981-1993}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Context: Effort-aware models, e.g., effort-aware bug prediction models
   aim to help practitioners identify and prioritize buggy software
   locations according to the effort involved with fixing the bugs. Since
   the effort of current bugs is not yet known and the effort of past bugs
   is typically not explicitly recorded, effort-aware bug prediction models
   are forced to use approximations, such as the number of lines of code
   (LOC) of the predicted files.
   Objective: Although the choice of these approximations is critical for
   the performance of the prediction models, there is no empirical evidence
   on whether LOC is actually a good approximation. Therefore, in this
   paper, we investigate the question: is LOC a good measure of effort for
   use in effort-aware models?
   Method: We perform an empirical study on four open source projects, for
   which we obtain explicitly-recorded effort data, and compare the use of
   LOC to various complexity, size and churn metrics as measures of effort.
   Results: We find that using a combination of complexity, size and churn
   metrics are a better measure of effort than using LOC alone.
   Furthermore, we examine the impact of our findings on previous
   effort-aware bug prediction work and find that using LOC as a measure
   for effort does not significantly affect the list of files being
   flagged, however, using LOC under-estimates the amount of effort
   required compared to our best effort predictor by approximately 66\%.
   Conclusion: Studies using effort-aware models should not assume that LOC
   is a good measure of effort. For the case of effort-aware bug
   prediction, using LOC provides results that are similar to combining
   complexity, churn, size and LOC as a proxy for effort when prioritizing
   the most risky files. However, we find that for the purpose of
   effort-estimation, using LOC may under-estimate the amount of effort
   required. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   lower O'Driscoll scores (p<0.05). 3D micro-CT analysis showed that
   repaired TR defects regained normal un-operated values of bone volume
   fraction, trabecular thickness, and trabecular number, whereas in MFC
   defects the repaired bone architecture appeared immature and less dense
   compared to intact un-operated MFC controls (p<0.0001). Severe medial
   meniscal damage was found in 28\% of operated animals and was strongly
   correlated with (i) low cartilage defect fill, (ii) incomplete bone
   repair in MFC, and (iii) with a more posterior defect placement in the
   weight-bearing region. We conclude that the location of cartilage
   lesions influences cartilage repair, with better outcome in TR versus
   MFC defects in rabbits. Meniscal degeneration is associated with
   cartilage damage. (c) 2013 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by

Abstract = {{Accurate predictive models can support the exploitation of Polymer-Clay
   Nanocomposites (PCN) in their evergrowing applications. The purpose of
   this paper is to validate commonly used analytical micromechanical
   models for the prediction of PCN's elastic properties with the help of
   3D periodic Finite Element (FE) simulations of the same microstructures,
   considered as reference data. The effect of the interphase was taken
   into account in a two-step homogenization procedure that exploits the
   effective particle concept. The predictions of a range of procedures
   relying on the different micromechanical models (i.e. Mori-Tanaka,
   self-consistent and Lielens's) were tested. An elaborate series of FE
   simulations was performed to determine Representative Volume Elements
   (RVEs). In addition, a simplified procedure to guide the definition of
   the RVE based on statistical and transverse isotropy symmetry criteria
   was developed. The predicted elastic properties of PCN were studied as a
   function of the thickness and the elastic properties of the formed
   interphase around the nanoclay platelets. It was found that the
   Mori-Tanaka model was the most reliable method for the simulated cases.
   Furthermore, numerical model predictions were compared with experimental
   results extracted from the literature for aligned exfoliated Nylon-6
   Montmorillonite nanocomposites. Finally, a comparison between the
   parametric study results and the experimental data was used to estimate
   the properties and the thickness of the interphase. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.

   reconstruction method was designed to deal with only two materials. In
   this paper we present the generalisation of the method to more than two
   materials. The design principles remain the same as for the two material
   method. Nevertheless some specific treatments have been added, like an
   automatic order of treatment of materials using material centres of mass
   in the so-called condensate. Interestingly the method can accept any
   interface reconstruction method. For simplicity, the crude onion skin
   approach with unique material normal has been chosen. The entire scheme
   has been tested on the four material disc embedded into a reversible
   incompressible velocity field test case for which numerical error can be
   computed. Then several more demanding hydrodynamics impacts of droplets
   on thin film have been simulated to show the ability of the method to
   qualitatively capture three material complex behaviours (sliding,
   impact). (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Inverse identification of constitutive parameters of materials might be
   adversely influenced by noise in the measured data. This study is
   concerned with an improved Finite Element Model Updating (FEMU) for
   accurate identification of mechanical properties of composite materials
   components from full-field measured displacement data. This
   numerical-analytical approach, namely Regularized Model Updating (RMU),
   is developed based on a hybrid constrained optimization algorithm. For
   this purpose, mechanical constraints, consisting of an appropriate
   homogenization model, are added as regularization factors to the
   optimization algorithm. The proposed method is validated by conducting
   several virtual experiments through elastic constitutive parameters
   identification of 2D composites. The sensitivity of the developed
   algorithm to different levels of noises of measured displacement fields
   is investigated. The identification results indicate that the proposed
   RMU methodology leads to higher accuracy of mechanical properties in
   comparison with FEMU method, particularly in the presence of random
   noise. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The authors observe that the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the
   Iridium (III) bis(4-phenylthieno
   {[}3,2-c]pyridinato-N,C-2')acetylacetonate (PO-01) based yellow organic
   light-emitting diode (OLED) is significantly increased by uniformly

   (FIrpic) and PO-01 into the same wide band-gap host of
   N,N'-dicarbazolyl-3, 5-benzene (mCP). Detailed investigation indicates
   that the efficiency enhancement is ascribed to effective triplet exciton
   gathering by FIrpic, followed by energy transfer to PO-01. Compared to
   the control device, which has maximum EQE of 10.5\%, an improved maximum
   EQE of 13.2\% is obtained in the optimization white device based on
   FIrpic and PO-01 emission according to this principle. This work makes
   it easier for a single host white OLED to simultaneously harvest high

Abstract = {{Terahertz plasmons and magnetoplasmons propagating along electrically

   and split away from the middle of the junction in the other direction
   under the application of an external static magnetic field. This
   phenomenon follows from the combined effects of circular birefringence

Abstract = {{An analytical method based on on-line SPE-LC-APCI-MS/MS has been
   developed for the detection and quantification of eight selected
   estrogenic and progestagenic steroid hormones; estrone (El), 17
   beta-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2),
   levonorgestrel (LEVO), medroxyprogesterone (MEDRO), norethindrone (NORE)
   and progesterone (PROG) in wastewater matrices. The injection volume
   could range from 1 to 10-mL according to the expected concentration of
   steroid hormones in matrix. The method characteristics are: analysis
   time per sample (<15 min), acceptable recovery values (71-95\%), good
   precision (RSD <= 10\%) and limits of detection at the low-nanogram per
   liter levels in affluent and effluent wastewaters (8-60 ng L-1). In
   particular, a detailed discussion of optimization parameters impacting
   overall performance of the method has been presented (sample collection,
   filtration and storage). All optimization and validation experiments for
   the on-line SPE method and chromatographic separation were performed in
   environmentally-relevant wastewater matrices. This method represents a
   compromise between analysis time, higher sample throughput capabilities,
   sample volume and simplicity for the analysis of both progestagenic and
   estrogenic steroid hormones in a single run, with LODs and LOQs
   sufficiently low to detect and quantify them in environmental wastewater
   matrices. Thus, the applicability of the method was tested on affluent
   and effluent wastewaters from two wastewater treatment facilities using
   different processes (biological and physico-chemical) to evaluate their
   removal efficiency for the detected steroid hormones. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{162-171}},

Abstract = {{Efficient inducible mammalian expression systems are becoming
   increasingly available and are particularly attractive from a process
   optimization point of view in that they allow decoupling the growth and
   production phases. In biphasic processes, the timing of induction is one
   of the most critical factors to consider for maximizing the
   productivity, since it will affect both the cumulative biomass
   concentration and the cell specific productivity. In an effort to assess
   how these two factors must be balanced for optimal productivity, we have
   performed a metabolic characterization of CHO cells expressing a
   recombinant antibody and harboring an efficient inducible expression
   system. Cells taken at different stages of growth were transferred and
   induced in fresh medium at their corresponding cell densities, and the
   kinetics of growth, nutrient consumption and product formation were
   compared during the production phase. Low cell density inductions
   achieved lower maximum cell concentrations, but exhibited higher cell
   specific productivity and greater culture longevity, and ultimately led
   to increased final product titers. To gain more physiological insights
   into the observed differences, C-13 metabolic flux analysis was
   performed to characterize and compare the metabolism of cells induced at
   respectively low and high cell concentrations. A number of key
   intracellular fluxes were found to be affected by the cell density and
   the corresponding availability of nutrients during the induction phase.
   While glucose utilization efficiency is increased in high cell density
   induction, thereby reducing the specific lactate production rate, it
   appears to be compensating for the decreased catabolic rates of amino
   acids. The comprehensive metabolic characterization performed in this
   work can help guide the development of an efficient feeding strategy
   pre- and post-induction. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the importance of polymer-polymer multiphase systems, very
   little work has been carried out on the preferred localization of solid
   inclusions in such multiphase systems. In this work, carbon nanotubes
   (CNT) are dispersed with polycaprolactone (PCL) and thermoplastic starch
   (TPS) at several CNT contents via a combined solution/twin-screw
   extrusion melt mixing method. A PCL/CNT masterbatch was first prepared
   and then blended with 20 wt\% TPS. Transmission and scanning electron
   microscopy images reveal a CNT localization principally in the TPS phase
   and partly at the PCL/TPS interface, with no further change by
   annealing. This indicates a strong driving force for the CNTs toward
   TPS. Young's model predicts that the nanotubes should be located at the
   interface. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of extracted CNTs
   quantitatively confirms an encapsulation by TPS and reveals a covalent
   bonding of CNTs with thermoplastic starch. It appears likely that the
   nanotubes migrate to the interface, react with TPS and then are
   subsequently drawn into the low viscosity TPS phase. In a low shear
   rate/low shear stress internal mixer the nanotubes are found both in the
   PCL phase and at the PCL/TPS interface and have not completed the
   transit to the TPS phase. This latter result indicates the importance of
   choosing appropriate processing conditions in order to minimize kinetic
   effects. The addition of CNTs to PCL results in an increase in the
   crystallization temperature and a decrease in the percent crystallinity
   confirming the heterogeneous nucleating effect of the nanotubes.
   Finally, DMA analysis reveals a dramatic decrease in the starch rich
   phase transition temperature (similar to 26 degrees C), for the system
   with nanotubes located in the TPS phase. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Chitosan-glycerol-phosphate (GP) solutions undergo a sol-gel transition
   upon heating. A model of heat-induced transfer of protons from chitosan
   to GP in solution has been proposed to explain this sol-gel transition.
   This model suggests that reduced inter-chain electrostatic repulsion by
   a decreased protonation of positively charged amino groups - via proton
   transfer to GP(2-) thereby reduced to GP(-) - would allow chitosan
   polymer chains to precipitate together and form a solid hydrogel
   structure. The hypothesis that GP has the single role of acting as a
   proton acceptor and not as a divalent electrostatic cross-linker of
   chitosan amine groups suggests that it should freely diffuse out of the
   gel after the gel formation. We found indeed that GP is free to diffuse
   and the experimental diffusion profile corresponds to a free diffusion
   model indicating that it plays no role in electrostatic cross-linking.
   Finally since chitosan amine groups in the gel are not bound to GP, we
   examined whether they are titratable in the gel. We show that chitosan
   in the hydrogel indeed possesses titratable amine groups with
   significant fixed charge up to +80 mM and follows the same ionization
   behavior as chitosan in solution. The results of these studies are
   significant in light of the current and future biomedical applications
   of this system, including its recent clinical approval as a biomaterial
   for cartilage repair. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) region is organized into distinct
   subregions that coordinate survival-related responses during threat and
   stress {[}Bandler R, Keay KA, Floyd N, Price J (2000) Brain Res 53
   (1):95-104]. To examine PAG function in humans, researchers have relied
   primarily on functional MRI (fMRI), but technological and methodological
   limitations have prevented researchers from localizing responses to
   different PAG subregions. We used high-field strength (7-T) fMRI
   techniques to image the PAG at high resolution (0.75 mm isotropic),
   which was critical for dissociating the PAG from the greater signal
   variability in the aqueduct. Activation while participants were exposed
   to emotionally aversive images segregated into subregions of the PAG
   along both dorsal/ventral and rostral/caudal axes. In the rostral PAG,
   activity was localized to lateral and dorsomedial subregions. In caudal
   PAG, activity was localized to the ventrolateral region. This shifting
   pattern of activity from dorsal to ventral PAG along the rostrocaudal
   axis mirrors structural and functional neurobiological observations in
   nonhuman animals. Activity in lateral and ventrolateral subregions also
   grouped with distinct emotional experiences (e. g., anger and sadness)
   in a factor analysis, suggesting that each subregion participates in
   distinct functional circuitry. This study establishes the use of
   high-field strength fMRI as a promising technique for revealing the
   functional architecture of the PAG. The techniques developed here also
   may be extended to investigate the functional roles of other brainstem
   nuclei.}},

Abstract = {{The engineering of a 3 T human MRI scanner equipped with 300 mT/m
   gradients - the strongest gradients ever built for an in vivo human MRI
   scanner - was a major component of the NIH Blueprint Human Connectome
   Project (HCP). This effort was motivated by the HCP's goal of mapping,
   as completely as possible, the macroscopic structural connections of the
   in vivo healthy, adult human brain using diffusion tractography. Yet,
   the 300 mT/m gradient system is well suited to many additional types of
   diffusion measurements. Here, we present three initial applications of
   the 300 mT/m gradients that fall outside the immediate scope of the HCP.
   These include: 1) diffusion tractography to study the anatomy of
   consciousness and the mechanisms of brain recovery following traumatic
   coma; 2) q-space measurements of axon diameter distributions in the in
   vivo human brain and 3) postmortem diffusion tractography as an adjunct
   to standard histopathological analysis. We show that the improved
   sensitivity and diffusion-resolution provided by the gradients are
   rapidly enabling human applications of techniques that were previously
   possible only for in vitro and animal models on small-bore scanners,
   thereby creating novel opportunities to map the microstructure of the
   human brain in health and disease. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{The effect of biomass particles on the gas distribution and dilute phase

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{102}},

Abstract = {{The gas distribution between the dilute (bubble) and dense (emulsion)
   phases of a fluidized bed is studied locally and globally in the
   bubbling regime for mixtures composed of sand and different weight
   fractions of biomass (2-16\%). The dilute phase has been characterized
   by analyzing the pressure and voidage signals. A suite of pressure
   transducers was used to measure pressure fluctuations at different
   locations along the bed. A reflective optical probe measured local
   voidage signals and was placed at different radii (0 < r/R < 0.87) at a
   height of h=175 mm above the distributor plate. The mean voidage of the
   bed is increased with higher biomass loading, primarily because of
   dilution of the emulsion phase. Changing the quantity of biomass in the
   bed does not significantly affect the voidage of the bubble and emulsion
   phases. The void (bubble) fraction increases at the center of the bed,
   whereas it decreases and then increases at the wall region with
   increasing weight fraction of biomass. Higher quantities of biomass
   reduce the mean bubble size and boost the bubble frequency at the center
   of the bed. The core-annulus structure of the bed is intensified for
   mixtures with relatively low quantities of biomass, while increasing the
   biomass load leads to a more uniform distribution of small bubbles
   across the bed improving the fluidization quality. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We report the synthesis and characterization of gold bacteriophage
   hybrids for biodetection purposes. The physical and optical properties
   of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and the biological features of the phages
   offer a multifunctional scaffold with great potential for
   nanotechnologically based biomedical applications. AuNPs, stabilized
   (PEGylated) using heterobifunctional polyethylene glycol (PEG), were
   coupled to methicillin-resistant S. aureus-specific phages. The PEG
   ligands contain a thiol group for stable anchoring to the gold surface
   and a terminal carboxylic acid group for further coupling to the outside
   of the PEG shell by carbodiimide chemistry. Transmission electron
   microscopic analysis showed that the NP-phage bioconjugates are highly
   stable, with a median diameter of 90 nm. X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy was used to chemically characterize the surfaces of the
   PEG-functionalized AuNPs, the bacteriophages, and the gold phage
   hybrids. The role of the interface and the covalent coupling chemistry
   employed to attach the phages to the AuNPs have been delineated.
   Successful attachment of phages to AuNPs was confirmed by the presence
   of amide between the primary amines of the phages and the carboxylic
   acid terminal groups of the NPs and by the presence of carboxyl and
   amine species, which form hydrogen bonds.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid human movements can be assimilated to the output of a
   neuromuscular system with an impulse response modeled by a
   Delta-Lognormal equation. In such a model, the main assumption concerns
   the cumulative time delays of the response as it propagates toward the
   effector following a command. To verify the validity of this assumption,
   delays between bursts in electromyographic (EMG) signals of agonist and
   antagonist muscles activated during a rapid hand movement were
   investigated. Delays were measured between the surface EMG signals of
   six muscles of the upper limb during single rapid handwriting strokes.
   From EMG envelopes, regressions were obtained between the timing of the
   burst of activity produced by each monitored muscle. High correlation
   coefficients were obtained supporting the proportionality of the
   cumulative time delays, the basic hypothesis of the Delta-Lognormal
   model. A paradigm governing the sequence of muscle activities in a rapid
   movement could, in the long run, be useful for applications dealing with
   the analysis and synthesis of human movements. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This paper reports the results of a model-based analysis of movements
   gathered in a 4 x 4 experimental design of speed/accuracy tradeoffs with
   variable target distances and width. Our study was performed on a large
   (120 participants) and varied sample (both genders, wide age range,
   various health conditions). The delta-lognormal equation was used for
   data modeling to investigate the interaction between the output of the
   agonist and the antagonist neuromuscular systems. Empirical observations
   show that the subjects must correlate more tightly the impulse commands
   sent to both neuromuscular systems in order to achieve good performances
   as the difficulty of the task increases whereas the correlation in the
   timing of the neuromuscular action co-varies with the size of the
   geometrical properties of the task. These new phenomena are discussed
   under the paradigm provided by the Kinematic Theory and new research
   hypotheses are proposed for further investigation of the speed/accuracy
   tradeoffs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Rock specimens collected from lower, middle, and upper portions of the
   exhumed Himalayan mid-crust in the upper Tama Kosi region of
   east-central Nepal yield pressure-temperature-time-deformation (P-T-t-D)
   paths that demonstrate the presence of a structural, metamorphic, and
   geochronologic discontinuity. A P-T-t-D path from below the
   discontinuity defines a loading path with deformation at
   staurolite-grade metamorphic conditions occurring at similar to 10-8 Ma.
   P-T-t-D paths from above the discontinuity, in contrast, record an
   earlier and protracted metamorphic history that includes decompressional
   heating. Monazite ages from specimens collected above the discontinuity
   constrain prograde garnet growth to be >21 Ma with decompression-related
   garnet breakdown initiating at c.19 Ma and likely continuing until c.15
   Ma. These contrasting P-T-t-D histories separated by a
   tectonometamorphic discontinuity are consistent with an evolutionary
   model for the Himalaya in which rocks above the discontinuity were
   metamorphosed in the deep hinterland of the orogen and deformed during
   lateral extrusion from beneath Tibet while rocks below the discontinuity
   were deformed and metamorphosed later within the shallower foreland of
   the orogen. These results demonstrate the spatial and temporal
   relationships and compatibility between lateral midcrustal extrusive
   flow and wedge taper processes within an evolving orogen. (C) 2013

   on the characteristics of Al-Mg-B films (Al-Mg-B-Ti) prepared by sputter
   deposition using unbalanced planar magnetrons equipped with Al-Mg alloy,
   TiB2 and B targets in a closed magnetic field configuration. The
   mechanical properties of Al-Mg-B-Ti films were investigated as a
   function of titanium concentration. We show that the maximum hardness of
   40.7 GPa and Young's modulus of 298 GPa were achieved with a titanium
   concentration of 20.5 at.\%. Detailed XPS, XRD and TEM analyses support
   a structural model that relates the experimentally reached superhardness
   (>40 GPa) to the formation of AlMgB14 and TiB2 nanoparticles imbedded in
   an amorphous Al-Mg-B matrix. The presence of the densely packed matrix
   is also shown to be responsible for enhanced corrosion resistance
   documented by exposures to saturated vapors of hydrochloric acid (HCl).

   Effect of wavelength and pulse duration}},
Journal = {{SURFACE \& COATINGS TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{232}},
Pages = {{758-766}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The lifetime of titanium-alloy aerospace parts can be greatly enhanced
   by the application of erosion-resistant coatings (ERC). After many hours
   in service, the coating will inevitably begin to deteriorate. To permit
   re-coating and repair of the parts, the coating should be removed. We
   present here a first attempt to strip TiN-based, 20 mu m-thick, coatings
   while comparing the suitability of two pulsed lasers: a femtosecond
   Ti:Sapphire laser emitting at 800 nm, and a nanosecond excimer laser
   centered at 248 nm. Following initial comparison of ablation thresholds
   for each laser, we optimized four critical laser parameters: power, beam
   diameter, stage speed and step distance. The results indicate that
   surface roughness can be improved by 35\% with the femtosecond laser in
   comparison with the nanosecond laser, while the higher energy per pulse
   offered by the latter one accelerates the etch rate by one order of
   magnitude. Surface composition analysis confirmed full removal of the
   coating and higher oxidization of the substrate with the excimer laser.
   Nanoindentation measurements on the polished cross-section of stripped
   samples show that the ablation process does not influence the hardness
   of the remaining substrate. To increase selectivity, plume emission
   spectroscopy has been investigated, in order to control, in real time,
   the material removal in regions where the coating thickness may vary.

Journal = {{ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{This paper builds upon the recent progress made in the field of
   thermoelectric energy conversion when using Bismuth Telluride Bi2Te3
   semiconductor modules. These commercially available modules have been
   the subject of many recent studies in which the common goal is to better
   understand their thermoelectric behavior when converting a low cost heat
   source to electricity. The present experimental work investigates the
   thermopower properties of a single module relative to the electrical
   load resistance with the use of two experimental apparatuses. The first
   test stand is built with a precision control of the injection and
   rejection of heat to and from the module; the second test stand is a
   novel demonstration of the module's application to thermoelectric solar
   energy conversion. The thermopower characteristics of the module are
   measured over a wide range of thermal input conditions. The results
   highlight the importance in calibrating to an optimal electrical load
   for peak power output. A normalized thermopower theoretical evolution
   curve relative to load resistance is presented. Furthermore, a method of
   thermoelectric recovery of solar radiation is demonstrated using
   laboratory controlled working conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Doxorubicin chemotherapy is effective and widely used to treat acute
   lymphoblastic leukemia. However, its effectiveness is hampered by a wide
   spectrum of dose-dependent cardiotoxicity including both morphological
   and functional changes, affecting primarily the myocardium. Non-invasive
   imaging techniques are used for the diagnosis and monitoring of these
   cardiotoxic effects. The purpose of this review is to summarize and
   compare the most common imaging techniques used in early detection and
   therapeutic monitoring of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and the
   suggested mechanisms of such side effects. Imaging techniques using
   echocardiography including conventional 2D and 3D echocardiography along
   with MRI sequences including Tagging, Cine, and quantitative MRI in
   detecting early myocardial damage are also reviewed. As there is a
   multitude of reported indices and imaging methods to assess particular
   functional alterations, we limit this review to the most relevant
   techniques based on their clinical application and their potential to
   early detection of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxic effects.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is aimed at understanding the mechanics of
   steel-fibre-reinforced concrete (SFRC) in the context of designing for
   structural applications. It focuses on the testing procedures adopted to
   obtain the tensile response of SFRC that are used in finite-element
   models of structural elements submitted to bending. Modelling of
   standardised material test specimens enabled validating the assumptions
   used in inverse analysis to determine the post-cracking sigma-w response
   from bending tests on notched beams and round panels. The effect of
   fibre orientation, the testing procedure and the validity of
   standardised test are discussed. Modelling of SFRC structural beams of
   different scales, shapes, with and without conventional reinforcement,
   emphasises the importance of using non-uniform material properties
   within the model to correctly predict the member stiffness and strength,
   and the crack opening evolution. The paper confirmed that the
   integration point spacing must be used as the reference length for
   converting sigma-w post-cracking response to sigma-epsilon material
   properties for carrying out finite-element analysis. Moreover this
   approach is not affected by the element size and member depth.}},

Abstract = {{Discrete choice models are increasingly implemented using geographical
   data. When this is the case, it may not be sufficient to project market
   shares accurately, but also to correctly replicate the spatial pattern
   of choices. Analysts might then be interested in assessing the results
   of a model's fit relative to the spatial distribution of the observed
   responses. While canonical approaches exist for the exploratory spatial
   analysis of continuous variables, similar tools have not been widely
   implemented for discrete choice models, where the variable of interest
   is categorical. For this reason, despite recent progress with spatial
   models for discrete outcomes, there is still not a simple and intuitive
   tool to assess the quality of the spatial fit of a discrete choice
   model. The objective of this paper is to introduce a new indicator of
   spatial fit that can be applied to the results of discrete choice
   models. Utility of the indicator is explored by means of numerical
   experiments and then demonstrated by means of a case study of vehicle
   ownership in Montreal, Canada. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This letter presents a study of image substrate integrated dielectric
   (iSINRD) guide arms at 94 GHz, from which a cruciform 3 dB coupler is
   conceived by superimposing their respective reflection coefficients.
   Four configurations are analyzed by investigating the boundary value
   problem in light of the electric and magnetic symmetries of the iSINRD
   guide. Mode conversion, and thus double bends, is totally avoided thanks
   to the PEC image plane. Thus, in addition to being planar, the coupler
   is very compact which makes it easily integrable in millimeter-wave
   circuits. The lateral dimensions of each arm are 0.413 x 0.635 mm(2).
   Perforation is done using square air-vias, each having a side length of
   0.35 mm. The total size of the circuit is 4.413 x 4.413 mm(2). Measured
   results agree well with simulated ones. A coupling level of 3.5 dB and
   isolation better than 17 dB are obtained for a bandwidth of 15\%.}},

Abstract = {{For emerging millimeter-wave wireless applications at W-and E-bands,
   active components including LNA and power amplifier are preferably
   fabricated or surface-mounted on the materials of a high dielectric
   constant (such as CMOS and MHMIC). On the other hand, antennas or
   radiating elements should be developed on relatively low-dielectric
   constant substrates for the enhancement of gain and bandwidth.
   Therefore, the development of a wideband transition from high-to-low
   dielectric constant substrates becomes necessary because the use of wire
   bonding schemes brings up packaging, interconnects, and manufacturing
   problems at millimeter-wave frequencies. This paper presents a novel
   integrated wideband transition of substrate integrated waveguide (SIW)
   on high-to-low dielectric constant substrates. The transition is made of
   a single-layer structure, which consists of a tapered high-dielectric
   constant substrate that connects two SIWs. Because of the
   waveguide-based structure of the transition, it has a self-shielded
   configuration, and its interference is minimum. Simulated and measured
   results show that the bandwidth of the proposed transition covers almost
   the entire W-and E-bands with low insertion loss.}},

   Value of RFID}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology is expected to play a
   vital role in the healthcare arena, especially in times when cost
   containments are at the top of the priorities of healthcare management
   authorities. Medical equipment represents a significant share of yearly
   healthcare operational costs; hence, ensuring an effective and efficient
   management of such key assets is critical to promptly and reliably
   deliver a diversity of clinical services at the patient bedside.
   Empirical evidence from a phased-out RFID implementation in one European
   hospital demonstrates that RFID has the potential to transform asset
   management by improving inventory management, enhancing asset
   utilization, increasing staff productivity, improving care services,
   enhancing maintenance compliance, and increasing information visibility.
   Most importantly, RFID allows the emergence of intelligent asset
   management processes, which is, undoubtedly, the most important benefit
   that could be derived from the RFID system. Results show that the added
   intelligence can be rather basic (auto-status change) or a bit more
   advanced (personalized automatic triggers). More importantly, adding
   intelligence improves planning and decision-making processes.}},

Title = {{A New Framework to Accurately Quantify Soil Bacterial Community
   Diversity from DGGE}},
Journal = {{MICROBIAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{647-658}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) has been and remains
   extensively used to assess and monitor the effects of various treatments
   on soil bacterial communities. Considering only abundant phylotypes, the
   diversity estimates produced by this technique have been proven to be
   uncorrelated to true community diversity. The aim of this paper was to
   develop a framework to estimate a community's true diversity from DGGE.
   Developed using in silico DGGE profiles generated from published
   pyrosequencing datasets, this framework elongates the rank-abundance
   distributions (RADs) drawn by band quantification using the
   peak-to-signal ratio (PSR) parameter, which was proven to be related to
   bacterial richness. The ability to compare DGGE-based diversity
   estimates to the true diversity of communities led to a unique
   opportunity to identify potential pitfalls when analyzing DGGE gels with
   commercial analysis software programs and gain insight into the process
   of DNA band clustering in the profiles. Bacterial diversity was compared
   through richness, Shannon, and Simpson's 1/D indices. Intermediate
   results demonstrated that, even though commercial gel analysis software
   programs were unable to produce consistent results throughout all
   samples, a newly developed Matlab-based framework unraveled the
   dominance profiles of communities from band quantification. Elongating
   these partial RADs using the PSRs extracted from the DGGE profiles
   chiefly made it possible to accurately estimate the true diversity of
   communities. For all the samples analyzed, the estimated Shannon and
   Simpson's 1/D were accurate at +/- 10 \%. Richness estimations were less
   accurate, ranging from -11 to 31 \% of the expected values. The
   framework showed great potential to study the structure and diversity of
   soil bacterial communities.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{347-382}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of a denial of service (DoS) attack is to render a network
   service unavailable for legitimate users. We address the problem of DoS
   attacks on connection-oriented protocols where the attacker tries to
   deplete the server connection by initiating communication with the
   server and then abandoning the communication. The most exploited attack
   in this category is the SYN-flood attack but other attacks using the
   same approach in stateful communication protocols also fall into this
   category. Our goals are twofold: first, to develop a mathematical model
   allowing us to analyse the trade-off between the attacker and the
   defender resources and second, to offer prevention mechanisms that can
   be used to defend against this category of attacks. We model the server
   queue of connections using Markov chains to establish a relationship
   between the server capacity, the attack rate and the impact on the
   service level. We analyse two methods of adjusting the timeout,
   threshold and linear, and we couple them with three policies of
   assigning the timeout to connections: the deterministic policy, the
   deferred policy and the utopian Poisson policy. First, theoretical
   modelling confirms that for any given strategy, there exists a linear
   trade-off between attack rate and targeted server queue size. However,
   the ratio that needs to be kept between them in order to maintain a
   similar level of quality of service differs between strategies; in that
   sense some are better than others. In particular, theoretical modelling
   also indicates that the linear deferred timeout strategy is very similar
   in performance to the linear Poisson timeout strategy, which in turn
   outperforms all the other dynamic timeout strategies. The dynamic
   timeout strategies always outperform the classical fixed timeout method.
   Our model is very general and can be used to capture the behaviour of
   the server queue during connection depletion attacks at various levels
   in the TCP protocol stack. We confirm the theoretical findings using
   stochastic simulations and network experiments of SYN-flood attacks. We
   also show how the model can be used when analysing a TCP connection
   establishment flood or a ticket reservation flood. The protection
   strategies we suggest are robust to changes in the attack model and our
   implementation is very efficient and transparent with respect to the
   server and applications it tries to protect. The strategies could
   therefore be easily integrated into existing operating systems and
   applications, or implemented in separate network devices.}},

   The work shifts of regular employees are often established several weeks
   in advance of the operations when the activity and task demands are
   still uncertain. Just a few days before the operations when these
   demands are unveiled with more certainty, the planned schedules can be
   slightly modified and on-call temporary employees can be scheduled to
   satisfy the demands as best as possible. As acceptable modifications,
   extending the planned shifts and moving workers' meal breaks are
   considered. In this paper, we are interested in the scheduling problem
   encountered in this second step, which also involves assigning
   activities and tasks to the scheduled work shifts. To produce
   good-quality solutions in fast computational times for large-sized
   instances, we develop a two-phase heuristic. In the first phase, an
   approximate mixed-integer programming model is used to suggest temporary
   shifts and extensions to regular shifts and to schedule and assign
   tasks. In the second phase, a column-generation heuristic embedded in a
   rolling horizon procedure determines the final shifts and assigns
   activities to them. Computational results obtained on randomly generated
   instances are reported to evaluate the validity of the proposed solution
   method.}},

Abstract = {{Microfracture (MFX) is a cartilage repair technique that depends on cell
   migration from marrow-rich trabecular bone cavities into the cartilage
   lesion. This study tested the hypothesis that MFX awls with distinct
   geometry generate different hole shapes and variable bone marrow access
   in condyles with Grade III to IV lesions. Lateral and medial condyles
   from total knee arthroplasty (N = 24 male and female patients, 66 +/- 9
   years) were systematically microfractured ex vivo to 2 and 4 mm deep and
   the bone holes analyzed by micro-computed tomography. Subchondral bone
   in lesional condyles showed different degrees of sclerosis up to 2 mm
   deep ({''}porous,{''} sclerotic, extremely dense). MFX holes ranged from
   1.1 to 2.0 mm in diameter, and retained the awl shape with evidence of
   slight bone elastic rebound and bone compaction lining the holes that
   were increased by wider awl diameter and deeper MFX. Marrow access was
   significantly diminished by sclerosis for all three awls, with an
   average marrow access varying from 70\% (nonlesional bone) to 40\%
   (extremely dense bone). This study revealed that subchondral bone
   sclerosis can reach a critical limit beyond which MFX creates bone
   compaction and fissures instead of marrow access.}},

Abstract = {{The morphology influencing rheological properties of suspensions of

   the rigid spheres are replaced by rigid fibers, the collective order in
   the position of the spheres is replaced by the flow induced orientation
   of the fibers that suffices to be characterized by one-fiber orientation
   distribution function. A flow induced collective ordering of fibers
   (both in position and orientation), that can only be characterized by
   two or more fiber distribution functions, can still however constitute
   an important part of the morphology. We show that two types of
   interaction among fibers, one being the Onsager-type topological
   interaction entering the free energy and the other the hydrodynamics
   interaction entering the dissipative part of the time evolution, give
   indeed rise to a collective order in the orientation influencing the

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a modified primal-dual interior-point method
   for nonlinear programming that relaxes the requirement of closely
   following the central path and lends itself to dynamic updates of the
   barrier parameter. The latter promote better synchronization between the
   barrier parameter and the optimality residual and increase robustness.
   In the framework of a generic outer iteration, we show that the dynamic
   barrier parameter converges to zero, that the unit Newton step is
   asymptotically accepted and that linear or superlinear convergence
   occurs when the barrier parameter goes to zero linearly or
   superlinearly. A salient feature of our algorithm resides in the
   transparent transition between the global and local regimes. Where a
   typical implementation of an interior-point method consists in chaining
   a globalization algorithm with a fast locally convergent algorithm, the
   method that we propose remains one and the same in the global and local
   phases. Numerical experiments show that our method improves the standard
   interior-point implementation substantially by dramatically reducing the
   number of inner iterations per outer iteration and by controlling the
   barrier parameter dynamically. It also compares favourably with other
   recent and less recent heuristic dynamic updates.}},

Abstract = {{Bug fixing accounts for a large amount of the software maintenance
   resources. Generally, bugs are reported, fixed, verified and closed.
   However, in some cases bugs have to be re-opened. Re-opened bugs
   increase maintenance costs, degrade the overall user-perceived quality
   of the software and lead to unnecessary rework by busy practitioners. In
   this paper, we study and predict re-opened bugs through a case study on
   three large open source projects-namely Eclipse, Apache and OpenOffice.
   We structure our study along four dimensions: (1) the work habits
   dimension (e.g., the weekday on which the bug was initially closed), (2)
   the bug report dimension (e.g., the component in which the bug was
   found) (3) the bug fix dimension (e.g., the amount of time it took to
   perform the initial fix) and (4) the team dimension (e.g., the
   experience of the bug fixer). We build decision trees using the
   aforementioned factors that aim to predict re-opened bugs. We perform
   top node analysis to determine which factors are the most important
   indicators of whether or not a bug will be re-opened. Our study shows
   that the comment text and last status of the bug when it is initially
   closed are the most important factors related to whether or not a bug
   will be re-opened. Using a combination of these dimensions, we can build
   explainable prediction models that can achieve a precision between
   52.1-78.6 \% and a recall in the range of 70.5-94.1 \% when predicting
   whether a bug will be re-opened. We find that the factors that best
   indicate which bugs might be re-opened vary based on the project. The
   comment text is the most important factor for the Eclipse and OpenOffice
   projects, while the last status is the most important one for Apache.
   These factors should be closely examined in order to reduce maintenance
   cost due to re-opened bugs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an efficient Multi-Start Iterated Local Search for
   Packing Problems (MS-ILS-PPs) metaheuristic for Multi-Capacity Bin
   Packing Problems (MCBPP) and Machine Reassignment Problems (MRP). The
   MCBPP is a generalization of the classical bin-packing problem in which
   the machine (bin) capacity and task (item) sizes are given by multiple
   (resource) dimensions. The MRP is a challenging and novel optimization
   problem, aimed at maximizing the usage of available machines by
   reallocating tasks/processes among those machines in a cost-efficient
   manner, while fulfilling several capacity, conflict, and
   dependency-related constraints. The proposed MS-ILS-PP approach relies
   on simple neighborhoods as well as problem-tailored shaking procedures.
   We perform computational experiments on MRP benchmark instances
   containing between 100 and 50,000 processes. Near-optimum multi-resource
   allocation and scheduling solutions are obtained while meeting specified
   processing-time requirements (on the order of minutes). In particular,

   solution value and a lower bound measure is smaller than 0.1\%. Our
   optimization method is also applied to solve classical benchmark
   instances for the MCBPP, yielding the best known solutions and optimum
   ones in most cases. In addition, several upper bounds for non-solved

Abstract = {{The south coast of Newfoundland (Canada) includes both open sea and
   semi-enclosed waterways which collectively account for over 20,000
   vessel movements annually. Every such movement poses the risk of an oil
   spill which can endanger the fragile marine life and tourism locales in
   the region, and is a source of concern to the communities. In an effort
   to analyze the problem, we present a two-stage stochastic programming
   approach which tackles both the location and stockpile of equipment at
   the emergency response facilities. The proposed optimization program was
   tested on realistic data collected from publicly available reports and
   through personal communications with emergency response personnel. These
   data were then varied to solve a number of scenarios which account for
   the stochastic nature of the problem parameters. Although only two
   response facilities seem to be appropriate for almost all scenarios, the
   size of equipment stockpile is a function of both the societal
   disutility factor and the trade-off between environmental cost and
   facility and equipment acquisition cost. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Finite element analysis is a powerful tool routinely used to study
   complex biological systems. For the last four decades, the lumbar
   intervertebral disc has been the focus of many such investigations. To
   understand the disc functional biomechanics, a precise knowledge of the
   disc mechanical, structural and biochemical environments at the
   microscopic and macroscopic levels is essential. In response to this
   need, finite element model studies have proven themselves as reliable
   and robust tools when combined with in vitro and in vivo measurements.
   This paper aims to review and discuss some salient findings of reported
   finite element simulations of lumbar intervertebral discs with special
   focus on their relevance and implications in disc functional
   biomechanics. Towards this goal, the earlier investigations are
   presented, discussed and summarized separately in three distinct groups
   of elastic, multi-phasic transient and transport model studies.
   The disc overall response as well as the relative role of its
   constituents are markedly influenced by loading rate, magnitude,
   combinations/preloads and posture. The nucleus fluid content and
   pressurizing capacity affect the disc compliance, annulus strains and
   failure sites/modes. Biodynamics of the disc is affected by not only the
   excitation characteristics but also preloads, existing mass and nucleus
   condition. The role of fluid pressurization and collagen fiber
   stiffening diminish with time during diurnal loading. The endplates
   permeability influences the time-dependent response of the disc in both
   loaded and unloaded recovery phases. The transport of solutes is
   substantially influenced by the disc size, tissue diffusivity and
   endplates permeability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Anterior shear has been implicated as a risk factor in spinal injuries.
   A 3D nonlinear poroelastic finite element model study of a lumbar motion
   segment L4-L5 was performed to predict the temporal shear response under
   various single and combined shear loads. Effects of nucleotomy and
   facetectomy as well as changes in the posture and facet gap distance
   were analyzed as well.
   Comparison of the predicted anterior displacement and stiffness response
   with available measurements indicates satisfactory agreement. Under
   shear loads up to 400 N, the model predicted an almost linear
   displacement response. With increasing shear load and/or compressive
   preload, the stiffening behavior becomes evident, primarily due to
   stretched collagen fibers and greater facet interactions. Removal of the
   facets markedly decreases the segmental stiffness in shear and thus
   highlights the importance of the facets in resisting shear force;
   61-87\% of the applied shear force is transmitted through the facets
   depending on the magnitude of the applied shear and compressive preload.
   Fluid exudation during the day as well as reduced facet gap distance and
   a more extended posture yielded higher facet joint forces. The shear
   resistance of the motion segment remains almost the same with time
   despite the transfer of load sharing from the disc to facets.
   Large forces on facet joints are computed especially under greater
   compression preloads, shear forces and extension rotations, as time
   progresses and with smaller gap distances. The disc contribution on the
   other hand increases under larger shear loads, smaller compression
   preloads, flexed postures, larger facet gap distances and at transient
   periods. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A general and efficient converging iterative process is used to
   determine the heat flux emanating from heat sources kept at prescribed
   temperatures. The algorithm uses analytical models, whose source is
   represented by a Neumann boundary condition or a source term. As a final
   result, the algorithm provides a heat flux signal that ensures the
   reproduction of a prescribed temperature signal at a source. The
   algorithm can manage several interacting sources and can handle
   different time varying temperatures at each source. To account for
   time-varying heat flux, the temporal superposition principle is used and
   expressed as a convolution product, and then solved with a fast Fourier
   transform to significantly cut down the computation time. It is shown
   that the proposed algorithm is fast and accurate. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{We have studied the influence of different statistical distributions of

   function of the CNT density observed experimentally can be accurately
   reproduced through simulations by considering a tube-tube resistance
   centered at 0.1-1.0 M Omega, in agreement with the experimental
   estimation. Since the number of tube-tube contacts is increasing rapidly
   with the size of the simulated network, a statistical representation of
   tube-tube resistances for large CNT network models does not introduce a

Abstract = {{Considerable amount of experimental work has been performed to elucidate
   the behavior of granular flow inside a rotating drum and it has yet to
   be clearly understood. However, a majority of these investigations have
   involved spherical or nearly spherical particles. The extent of the
   experiments involving non spherical particles previously carried out was
   limited by the experimental technique used for the investigation or the
   inability to single out the effect of the particle shape. In this work,
   the radioactive particle tracking technique (RPT) is adapted to follow
   large non spherical particles inside a rotating drum. The particles
   consist of pharmaceutical tablets containing a suitable compound, thus
   enabling their use as a tracer particle. Three crucial aspects of
   particle dynamics inside a rotating drum are studied: residence time in
   the active and passive layers, mixing and segregation, as well as axial
   dispersion. The results obtained for non spherical particles are
   compared to those which would be predicted using models developed for
   spherical of nearly spherical particles. For the different shapes
   studied in this work, it is found that particles having an aspect ratio
   greater than two can lead to significant deviations in velocity profile
   and residence time In addition, the mixing of different shaped particles
   is observed to lead to unexpected core segregation patterns. Lastly, it
   is found that the non-spherical particle higher degree of spatial
   orientation in the active layer leads to a lower axial dispersion
   coefficient than the ones obtained with spherical particles. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Plasmon waveguide resonance (PWR) sensors are particularly useful for
   biosensing due to their unique ability to perform sensing with two
   different polarizations. In this paper we report a comprehensive
   performance comparison between the surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
   sensor and the PWR sensor in terms of the sensitivity and the refractive
   index resolution. Both sensors were optimized using a genetic algorithm
   to acquire their best performance for bulk sensing applications. The
   experimental results show that the PWR sensor has a refractive index
   resolution of 5 x 10(-7) RIU which is 6 times smaller than that of the
   optimized SPR sensor. The TE polarization in the PWR sensor has a
   resolution of 1.4 x 10(-6) RIU which is smaller than the SPR sensor. The
   polarization diversity in the PWR sensor is another advantage which can
   be used to improve the measurement reliability. (C) 2013 Optical Society

Abstract = {{Determination of the trunk maximum voluntary exertion moment capacity
   and associated internal spinal forces could serve in proper selection of
   workers for specific occupational task requirements, injury prevention
   and treatment outcome evaluations. Maximum isometric trunk exertion
   moments in flexion and extension along with surface EMG of select trunk
   muscles are measured in 12 asymptomatic subjects. Subsequently and under
   individualized measured harness-subject forces, kinematics and upper
   trunk gravity, an iterative kinematics-driven finite element model is
   used to compute muscle forces and spinal loads in 4 of these subjects.
   Different co-activity and intra-abdominal pressure levels are simulated.
   Results indicate significantly larger maximal resistant moments and
   spinal compression/shear forces in extension exertions than flexion
   exertions. The agonist trunk muscles reach their maximum force
   generation (saturation) to greater extent in extension exertions
   compared to flexion exertions. Local lumbar extensor muscles are highly
   active in extension exertions and generate most of the internal spinal
   forces. The maximum exertion attempts produce large spinal compression
   and shear loads that increase with the antagonist co-activity level but
   decrease with the intra-abdominal pressure. Intra-abdominal pressure
   decreases agonist muscle forces in extension exertions but generally
   increase them in flexion exertions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A constitutive model to describe the triaxial load-response spectrum of
   plain concrete in both tension and shear was developed. The inelastic
   phenomena are described using the plastic flow with direction determined
   by the gradient of the plastic potential. A new plastic potential is
   introduced and experimentally fitted to ensure better estimate of the
   load direction. This approach allows to control the inelastic dilatancy
   in terms of the inelastic deformation of the material. By overlaying the
   plastic potential on modified Etse and Willam's yield surface (both
   defined on the Haigh-Westergaard coordinates), the results showed that
   the two curves do not undergo similar stress states for a given strength
   level. It is, therefore, necessary that each surface goes through the
   current stress state to ensure adequate evaluation of normal vectors. A
   closed-form solution to accurately predict the triaxial stress state in
   concrete has been proposed. The predictive capabilities of the proposed
   model are evaluated by comparing predicted and measured stresses. The
   proposed model is shown to be accurate in predicting stress state of

Abstract = {{The phase formation sequence during the thermally induced solid-state

   substrate amorphized by ion implantation (a-Si) is investigated using a
   combination of in situ temperature-resolved x-ray diffraction and ex
   situ x-ray pole figure analyses, transmission electron microscopy, and
   Rutherford backscattering spectrometry. Our results reveal (1) that the
   metastable theta-phase grows from delta-Ni2Si and directly transforms
   into NiSi and (2) that cleaving the as-prepared, amorphized samples are
   often subject to a spontaneous reaction possibly resulting from
   cleaving. In the spontaneously reacted samples, a mixture of theta and
   NiSi is observed from the beginning of the thermal treatment. The theta
   phase exhibits a (110) fiber texture with a +/- 10 degrees
   misorientation, which is then inherited by NiSi. The rest of the phase
   sequence is the same as for nonreacted samples, the NiSi2 growing from
   390 degrees C if the amorphized Si is not completely consumed. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Thromboelastography uses cups and pins made of Cyrolite (R) plastic to

   plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD): carboxylated,
   amine-rich, hydrophobic, SiO2, and analyzed for surface chemistry and
   wettability. We tested the hypothesis that the coagulation kinetics of
   recalcified citrated blood plasma is controlled by surface chemistry, in
   the absence of clot activator. Only carboxylated surfaces became
   negatively charged upon wetting, and accelerated clot formation in a
   highly reproducible manner, whereas Cyrolite (R) and the other coatings
   had delayed and unpredictable clotting times. These data are consistent
   with a model whereby carboxylated surfaces selectively adsorb and
   activate factor XII while repelling other more abundant anionic blood
   proteins, resulting in reproducible clot kinetics.}},

Abstract = {{We present a mathematical model of a biological synapse based on
   stochastic processes to establish the temporal behavior of the
   postsynaptic potential following a quantal synaptic transmission. This
   potential form is the basis of the neural code. We suppose that the
   release of neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft follows a Poisson
   process, and that they diffuse according to integrated
   Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes in 3-D with random initial positions and
   velocities. The diffusion occurs in an isotropic environment between two
   infinite parallel planes representing the pre-and postsynaptic membrane.
   We state that the presynaptic membrane is perfectly reflecting and that
   the other is perfectly absorbing. The activation of the receptors
   polarizes the postsynaptic membrane according to a parallel RC circuit
   scheme. We present the results obtained by simulations according to a
   Gillespie algorithm and we show that our model exhibits realistic
   postsynaptic behaviors from a simple quantal occurrence.}},

Abstract = {{A large portion of the middle to lower crust beneath the continents and
   oceanic island arcs consists of amphibolites dominated by hornblende and
   plagioclase. We have measured P and S wave velocities (V-p and V-s) and
   anisotropy of 17 amphibole-rich rock samples containing 34-80vol\%
   amphibole at hydrostatic pressures (P) up to 650MPa. Combined
   petrophysical and geochemical analyses provide a new calibration for
   mean density, average major element contents, mean V-p-P and V-s-P
   coefficients, intrinsic V-p and V-s anisotropy, Poisson's ratios, the
   logarithmic ratio R-s/p, and elastic moduli of amphibole-rich rocks. The
   V-p values decrease with increasing SiO2 and Na2O+K2O contents but
   increase with increasing MgO and CaO contents. The maximum
   (0.38-0.40km/s) and minimum S wave birefringence values occur generally
   in the propagation direction parallel to Y and normal to foliation,
   respectively. Amphibole plays a critical role in the formation of
   seismic anisotropy, whereas the presence of plagioclase, quartz,
   pyroxene, and garnet diminishes the anisotropy induced by amphibole
   crystallographic preferred orientations (CPOs). The CPO variations cause
   different anisotropy patterns illustrated in the Flinn diagram of
   V-p(X)/V-p(Y)-V-p(Y)/V-p(Z) plots. The results make it possible to
   distinguish, in terms of seismic properties, the amphibolites from other
   categories of lithology such as granite-granodiorite, diorite,
   gabbro-diabase, felsic gneiss, mafic gneiss, eclogite, and peridotite
   within the Earth's crust. Hence, amphibole, aligned by dislocation
   creep, anisotropic growth, or rigid-body rotation, is the most important
   contributor to the seismic anisotropy of the deep crust beneath the
   continents and oceanic island arcs, which contains rather little
   phyllosilicates such as mica or chlorite.}},

Title = {{Giant non-reciprocity at the subwavelength scale using angular
   momentum-biased metamaterials}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Breaking time-reversal symmetry enables the realization of
   non-reciprocal devices, such as isolators and circulators, of
   fundamental importance in microwave and photonic communication systems.
   This effect is almost exclusively achieved today through magneto-optical
   phenomena, which are incompatible with integrated technology because of
   the required large magnetic bias. However, this is not the only option
   to break reciprocity. The Onsager-Casimir principle states that any odd
   vector under time reversal, such as electric current and linear
   momentum, can also produce a non-reciprocal response. These recently
   analysed alternatives typically work over a limited portion of the
   electromagnetic spectrum and/or are often characterized by weak effects,
   requiring large volumes of operation. Here we show that these
   limitations may be overcome by angular momentum-biased metamaterials, in
   which a properly tailored spatiotemporal modulation is azimuthally
   applied to subwavelength Fano-resonant inclusions, producing largely
   enhanced non-reciprocal response at the subwavelength scale, in
   principle applicable from radio to optical frequencies.}},

   of the city of Toronto in Canada, an urban area that has seen an
   increase in absolute and relative numbers of single-parent households in
   recent years, is presented. Analysis is based on the application of
   relative accessibility deprivation indicators (RADI), which are
   calculated using model-based estimates of distance traveled for various
   population segments, as well as employment data for the city and its
   surroundings. The results of the analysis indicate that there are
   substantial differences in the levels of accessibility to jobs between
   members of single-parent households, in particular females, and members

Abstract = {{The complete Mn-Nd phase diagram was established experimentally by means
   of key samples and diffusion couple techniques. The phase transformation
   temperatures, crystal structures and phase equilibria were studied using
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD),
   electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), and scanning electron microscope
   (SEM) techniques. Three compounds in the Mn-rich side and two terminal
   solid solutions in the Nd-rich side were observed. The compounds Mn2Nd,
   Mn23Nd6, and Mn17Nd2 form peritectically at 850, 940, and 1025 degrees
   C, respectively. The eutectoidal decompositions of the compounds, Mn2Nd,
   and Mn23Nd6, were confirmed in the temperature ranges of 650-550 and
   550-400 degrees C, respectively, using EPMA. The maximum solubility of
   Mn in DHCP-Nd was found to be 2.3 at\% Mn at the 685 degrees C eutectic
   temperature. The solvus line of DHCP-Nd was determined using EPMA. The
   solubility of Mn in BCC-Nd was extrapolated from DSC data to be 5.0 at\%
   Mn at 728 degrees C. The existence of a Mn17Nd2 phase of the Th2Ni17
   type structure was confirmed using EPMA and XRD. The system was modelled
   using CALPHAD methodology. The quasi-chemical model (QCM) was used to
   describe the liquid phase, the terminal solution phases were modeled as
   substitutional solutions using the random mixing model, and the
   intermetallic compounds were treated as stoichiometric phases. The
   enthalpies of formation of the system compounds were calculated using
   the electronic density functional method. The resulting enthalpy of
   mixing was in good agreement with the literature. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Refractive urinary dysfunction in individuals suffering from neurogenic
   bladder syndrome can be treated with implanted neurostimulators that
   restore, to some degree, the control of the urinary bladder. A sensor
   capable of relaying feedback from bladder activity to the implanted
   neurostimulator is required to implement a closed-loop system to improve
   overall implant efficacy and minimize deleterious effects to neural
   tissue caused by continuous electrical stimulation. In this paper, we
   present a method that allows real-time estimation of bladder volume from
   the primary afferent activity of bladder mechanoreceptors. Our method
   was validated with data acquired from anesthetized rats in acute
   experiments. It was possible to qualitatively estimate three states of
   bladder fullness in 100\% of trials when the recorded afferent activity
   exhibited a Spearman's correlation coefficient of 0.6 or better.
   Furthermore, we could quantitatively estimate bladder volume, and also
   its pressure, using timeframes of properly chosen duration. The mean
   volume estimation error was 5.8 +/- 3.1\%. Our results also demonstrate
   that it is possible to quantify both phasic and tonic bladder responses
   during slow filling and isovolumetric measurements, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate an amplitude-based bending/displacement sensor that uses
   a plastic photonic bandgap Bragg fiber with one end coated with a silver
   layer. The reflection intensity of the Bragg fiber is characterized in
   response to different displacements (or bending curvatures). We note
   that the Bragg reflector of the fiber acts as an efficient mode stripper
   for the wavelengths near the edge of the fiber bandgap, which makes the
   sensor extremely sensitive to bending or displacements at these
   wavelengths. Besides, by comparison of the Bragg fiber sensor to a
   sensor based on a standard multimode fiber with similar outer diameter
   and length, we find that the Bragg fiber sensor is more sensitive to
   bending due to the presence of a mode stripper in the form of a
   multilayer reflector. Experimental results show that the minimum
   detection limit of the Bragg fiber sensor can be as small as 3 mu m for
   displacement sensing. (C) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{A monitoring program was initiated for two sewage outfalls (OA and OB)
   with different land uses (mainly residential versus institutional) over
   the course of a year. Eleven CSO events resulting from fall and summer
   precipitations and a mixture of snowmelt and precipitation in late
   winter and early spring were monitored. Median concentrations measured
   in CSOs were 1.5 x 10(6) Escherichia coli/100 mL, 136.0 mg/L of Total
   Suspended Solids (TSS), 4599.0 ng/L of caffeine (CAF), 158.9 ng/L of
   carbamazepine (CBZ), in outfall OA and 5.1 x 10(4) E. coli/100 mL, 167.0
   mg TSS/L, 300.8 ng CAF/L, 4.1 ng CBZ/L, in outfall OB. Concentration
   dynamics in CSOs were mostly related to the dilution by stormwater and
   the time of day of the onset of overflows. Snowmelt was identified as a
   critical period with regards to the protection of drinking water sources
   given the high contaminant concentrations and long duration of events in
   addition to a lack of restrictions on overflows during this period.
   Correlations among measured parameters reflected the origins and
   transport pathways of the contaminants, with E. coli being correlated
   with CBZ. TSS were not correlated with E. coli because E. coli was found
   to be mostly associated with raw sewage whereas TSS were additionally
   from the resuspension of in-sewer deposits and surface runoff. In
   receiving waters, E. coli remained the best indicator of fecal
   contamination in strongly diluted water samples as compared to WWMPs
   because WWMPs can be diluted to below their detection limits. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This paper presents a control strategy for an islanded medium voltage
   microgrid to coordinate hybrid power source (HPS) units and to control
   interfaced multilevel inverters under unbalanced and nonlinear load
   conditions. The proposed HPS systems are connected to the loads through
   a cascaded H-bridge (CHB) multilevel inverter. The CHB multilevel
   inverters increase the output voltage level and enhance power quality.
   The HPS employs fuel cell (FC) and photovoltaic sources as the main and
   supercapacitors as the complementary power sources. Fast transient
   response, high performance, high power density, and low FC fuel
   consumption are the main advantages of the proposed HPS system. The
   proposed control strategy consists of a power management unit for the
   HPS system and a voltage controller for the CHB multilevel inverter.
   Each distributed generation unit employs a multiproportional resonant
   controller to regulate the buses voltages even when the loads are
   unbalanced and/or nonlinear. Digital time-domain simulation studies are
   carried out in the PSCAD/EMTDC environment to verify the performance of
   the overall proposed control system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel hybrid genetic algorithm (GA)-particle swarm

   The proposed approach maximizes overall system reliability while
   minimizing system cost, system weight and volume, simultaneously, under
   nonlinear constraints. To meet these objectives, an adaptive hybrid
   GA-PSO approach is developed to identify the optimal solutions and
   improve computation efficiency for these NP-hard problems. An
   illustrative example is applied to show the capability and effectiveness
   of the proposed approach. According to the results, in all three cases,
   reliability values are improved. Moreover, computational time and
   variance are decreased compared to the similar studies. The proposed
   approach could be helpful for engineers and managers to better
   understand their system reliability and performance, and also to reach a

Abstract = {{The self-centering energy dissipative (SCED) brace is a new steel
   bracing member that provides both damping to the structure and a
   re-centering capability. The goal of this study was to confirm the
   behavior of SCED braces within complete structural systems and to
   confirm the ability to model these systems with both a state-of-the-art
   computer model as well as a simplified model that would be useful to
   practicing engineers. To these ends, a three-story SCED-braced frame was
   designed and constructed for testing on a shake table. Two concurrent
   computer models of the entire frame were constructed: one using the
   opensees nonlinear dynamic modeling software, and a simplified model
   using the commercial structural analysis software sap2000. The frame
   specimen was subjected to 12 significant earthquakes without any
   adjustment or modification between the tests. The SCED braces prevented
   residual drifts in the frame, as designed, and did not show any
   significant degradation due to wear. Both numerical models were able to
   predict the drifts, story shears, and column forces well. Peak story
   accelerations were overestimated in the models; this effect was found to
   be caused by the absence of transitions at stiffness changes in the
   hysteretic model of the braces. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Flexible Injection is a new processing technique for the manufacture of
   advanced composites made of continuous reinforcing fibers and
   thermosetting polymer matrix. The primary objective of this new process
   is to provide faster and less expensive manufacturing than traditional
   methods like autoclave processing or Resin Transfer Molding. The present
   paper investigates the effectiveness of the proposed method to produce
   composite structures possessing sharp corners. A specially devised setup
   is used to manufacture out of glass fibers and vinyl ester resin a
   series of Z-shaped parts with small radii. The quality of the fabricated
   parts is assessed to detect possible defects induced by the
   manufacturing process. Each stage of the production cycle is analyzed
   thoroughly to develop a simplified finite element model reproducing the
   fiber bed behavior during processing. Parametric studies are conducted
   to evaluate the impact of processing conditions on the quality of final
   products. The combination of numerical simulations and experimental
   observations demonstrates clearly the importance of the preforming
   stage. At the same time, it provides useful insights on the physical
   phenomena occurring during Flexible Injection.}},

Abstract = {{Contamination of permafrost by hydrocarbons is an important issue in
   northern regions. In addition to harmful environmental impacts,
   diesel-fuel spills in permafrost associated with vehicle-storage areas,
   storage tanks, and pipelines can also lead to loss of strength of the
   frozen soils. Investigations of the reduction in strength of
   contaminated frozen soils have typically been restricted to salt
   contamination. However, the mechanical behavior of diesel-contaminated
   frozen soils may vary from that of salt-contaminated frozen soils. This
   paper presents the results of two series of unconfined uniaxial
   compression tests on artificial (laboratory produced)
   diesel-contaminated and uncontaminated frozen silty-soil specimens at
   two different temperatures ( and ). A total of 58 specimens were tested.
   The influence of total liquid content (water and diesel), density,
   freezing method, and amount of diesel contamination on the decrease in
   compressive strength of the specimens is examined.}},

   obtained from the sensors. In the micro-milling experimental case study,
   four sets of cutting force data are used to generate the learning

Abstract = {{In this paper, the performance of variable-rate adaptive modulation
   schemes in the amplify-and-forward cooperative systems with relay
   selection is analyzed over Rayleigh fading channels. We consider
   constant power and discrete-rate adaptive multi-level modulation
   techniques. The switching levels required for discrete-rate adaptive
   modulation have been determined for two schemes, namely fixed switching
   levels and optimum switching levels, both respecting a target bit error
   rate requirements, where in the later scheme, the switching levels are
   optimally determined in a way that the average spectral efficiency of
   the system is maximized. Two M-ary modulation schemes, namely quadrature
   amplitude modulation and phase shift keying, are considered. Closed-form
   expressions are derived for three performance metrics, namely average
   spectral efficiency, outage probability, and average bit error rate, for
   two cases: independent and identically distributed fading relay links
   and independent and non-identically distributed links. It is shown that,
   compared with using fixed switching levels, employing optimum switching
   levels provides a slight improvement in the spectral efficiency and
   moderate improvements in the signal-to-noise ratio gain and in the
   outage probability of the system. It is also shown that compared with
   the independent and identically distributed links, independent and
   non-identically distributed relay links yield a slight increase in the
   signal-to-noise ratio gain and a slight decrease in the diversity order
   of the system. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Ubiquitous positioning provides continuous positional information in
   both indoor and outdoor environments for a wide spectrum of location
   based service (LBS) applications. With the rapid development of the
   low-cost and high speed data communication, Wi-Fi networks in many

   access points (APs) namely received signal strength (RSS) have been
   cleverly adopted for indoor positioning. In this paper, a Wi-Fi
   positioning algorithm based on neural network modeling of Wi-Fi signal
   patterns is proposed. This algorithm is based on the correlation between
   the initial parameter setting for neural network training and output of
   the mean square error to obtain better modeling of the nonlinear highly
   complex Wi-Fi signal power propagation surface. The test results show
   that this neural network based data processing algorithm can

   spatially discretized dynamical equations are derived using Lagrange's
   equation based on the expression of the kinetic and potential energies
   of the flexible link system. The effect of the links foreshortening on
   the dynamical response is shown for a sinusoidal torque input at the
   links hub. The simulation results showed that for small torque
   amplitudes the difference between linear and nonlinear kinematics is
   small. However, for large amplitudes, this difference is prominent.}},

Abstract = {{The low coefficient of thermal expansion and good wear resistance of
   hypereutectic Al-Si-Mg alloys with high Mg contents, together with the
   increasing demand for lightweight materials in engine applications have
   generated an increasing interest in these materials in the automotive
   industry. In the interests of pursuing the development of new
   wear-resistant alloys, the current study was undertaken to investigate
   the effects of Mg additions ranging from 6 to 15 pct on the
   solidification behavior of hypereutectic Al-15Si-4Cu-Mg alloy using
   thermodynamic calculations, thermal analysis, and extensive
   microstructural examination. The Mg level strongly influenced the
   microstructural evolution of the primary Mg2Si phase as well as the
   solidification behavior. Thermodynamic predictions using ThermoCalc
   software reported the occurrence of six reactions, comprising the
   formation of primary Mg2Si; two pre-eutectic binary reactions, forming
   either Mg2Si + Si or Mg2Si + alpha-Al phases; the main ternary eutectic
   reaction forming Mg2Si + Si + alpha-Al; and two post-eutectic reactions
   resulting in the precipitation of the Q-Al5Mg8Cu2Si6 and theta-Al2Cu
   phases, respectively. Microstructures of the four alloys studied
   confirmed the presence of these phases, in addition to that of the
   pi-Al8Mg3FeSi6 (pi-Fe) phase. The presence of the pi-Fe phase was also
   confirmed by thermal analysis. The morphology of the primary Mg2Si phase
   changed from an octahedral to a dendrite form at 12.52 pct Mg. Any
   further Mg addition only coarsened the dendrites. Image analysis
   measurements revealed a close correlation between the measured and
   calculated phase fractions of the primary Mg2Si and Si phases.
   ThermoCalc and Scheil calculations show good agreement with the
   experimental results obtained from microstructural and thermal analyses.}},

Abstract = {{Liquid composite molding (LCM) is an increasingly used family of
   processes to manufacture composite parts. In LCM, the fibrous
   reinforcement is first laid in a mold cavity. After closure of the mold
   or covering of the reinforcement with a plastic bag, a liquid polymer
   resin is injected or infused under vacuum through the fiber bed. A key
   issue and novel feature of this investigation lies in the dual-scale
   architecture of engineering fabrics: microscopic pores exist between the
   filaments of the fiber tows, while macroscopic pores are created between
   the tows as a result of the stitching/weaving process. On a microscopic
   scale, capillary flows in fiber tows and gaps between tows play a major
   role on the quality of impregnation of the fiber bed by the liquid
   resin. In order to better understand the mechanisms that govern the
   impregnation of fibrous reinforcements in LCM, an experimental study of
   wicking behavior was carried out based on capillary rise experiments. A
   new monitoring technique based on fluorescent dye penetration inspection
   (DPI) and digital imaging was implemented in this investigation to track
   the capillary flow front. Visual monitoring of the capillary front is
   coupled with Wilhelmy's approach based on real-time fluid mass
   acquisition with a high resolution balance. Experimental observations of
   the height of the capillary front and the uptake fluid mass absorbed by
   the fabric were analyzed by two different imbibition models.}},

Abstract = {{Existing methods for surface matching are limited by the tradeoff
   between precision and computational efficiency. Here, we present an
   improved algorithm for dense vertex-to-vertex correspondence that uses
   direct matching of features defined on a surface and improves it by
   using spectral correspondence as a regularization. This algorithm has
   the speed of both feature matching and spectral matching while
   exhibiting greatly improved precision (distance errors of 1.4 percent).
   The method, FOCUSR, incorporates implicitly such additional features to
   calculate the correspondence and relies on the smoothness of the
   lowest-frequency harmonics of a graph Laplacian to spatially regularize
   the features. In its simplest form, FOCUSR is an improved spectral
   correspondence method that nonrigidly deforms spectral embeddings. We
   provide here a full realization of spectral correspondence where
   virtually any feature can be used as an additional information using
   weights on graph edges, but also on graph nodes and as extra embedded
   coordinates. As an example, the full power of FOCUSR is demonstrated in
   a real-case scenario with the challenging task of brain surface matching
   across several individuals. Our results show that combining features and
   regularizing them in a spectral embedding greatly improves the matching
   precision (to a submillimeter level) while performing at much greater
   speed than existing methods.}},

Abstract = {{With mobile phones evolving every year, it is no surprise that recent
   surveys have shown that the worldwide number of mobile phone
   subscriptions reached 5.6 billion in 2011, becoming the largest pool of
   interconnected devices. Since mobile IP is the most-used protocol by
   mobile operators, the obvious solution to support more users in their
   network would be to replace it with MIPv6. In addition to integrating
   the newest IP stack, MIPv6 adds an important feature meant to replace
   the inefficient triangle routing by allowing an MN to communicate
   bidirectionally with the CN without passing through its home agent.
   However, the lack of preshared information between the MN and CN makes
   security for this RO mechanism a difficult challenge. MIPv6 adopts the
   RR mechanism that is only to verify the MN reachability in both its home
   address and care-of address without being a security feature. Other
   works have attempted to solve the multiple security issues in RR, but
   either their design was flawed or their assumptions were unrealistic.
   This paper presents a secure MIPv6 with a secure and efficient RO that
   uses DNSSEC to validate CGAs from trusted domains and provides strong
   authentication rather than the weak sender invariance security property.
   It integrates an enhanced cryptographically generated address (ECGA)
   based on a backward key chain that offers support to bind multiple
   logically linked CGAs together. ECGA tackles the time-memory tradeoff
   attacks with high efficiency. The validation through both AVANTSSAR and
   AVISPA platforms show that the proposed solution has no security flaw
   while still being lightweight in signaling messages on the radio
   network.}},

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{111}},
Pages = {{316-323}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Propane combustion experiments were conducted in the freeboard of a
   fluidized bed of sand particles at temperatures between 818 K and 923 K
   and at superficial gas velocity twice the minimum fluidization velocity.
   The freeboard region was characterized by simultaneous measurements of
   solids flux, chemical composition, temperature and pressure.
   Autoignition was recorded within 0.06 m of the bed surface for bed
   temperatures greater than 833 K. Propane conversion predicted by six
   different microkinetic mechanistic models were compared to the
   experimental measurements: all six models underestimated the reaction
   rate above the bed surface. However, accounting for the production of
   intermediate species and H2O2 during in-bed combustion significantly
   increased the calculated reaction rates and resulted in a better
   agreement between predicted and measured propane conversion. (C) 2013

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{703}},
Pages = {{108-116}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on Pd-Co electro-catalyst has been
   studied in acidic media. The palladium alloys were prepared by coating
   glassy (GC) carbon substrates using a R-F magnetron sputtering equipment
   with a palladium and cobalt wafers as targets. The dual sputtering
   allowed us to obtain a thin film of 40-60 nm thick. The ORR kinetics was
   studied on these catalysts in 0.05 M H2SO4. An increase in the hydrogen
   adsorption charge, the oxide formation and the oxide reduction or
   desorption was observed with the Co content in the alloy for the alloys
   containing 20-84\% of Co. It was further shown that the ORR on Pd-Co
   alloys proceeds through four transferred electrons mechanism and a Tafel
   slope of 60 mV/dec. The electro catalytic performance of the ORR on the
   various electrodes studied here is: in the order Pd16Co84 < Pd42Co58 <
   Pd < Pd50Co50 < Pd75Co25 < Pd65Co35 < Pt. This result clearly shows that
   alloying Pd with a specific composition of Co enhances significantly the
   electro-catalytic properties of the ORR on Pd-Co alloys in comparison to
   Pd alone. The enhancement of the electro catalytic activity is
   attributed to an optimal d band property that makes easier the OOH
   dissociative adsorption which is considered as chemical rate-determining
   step (RDS) for the ORR. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   produced by a uniform electric-current-sheet source normally incident on
   a two-layered medium. The derivation is next generalized to the case of
   multilayered media. The problem is solved for the case where both the

Abstract = {{The alkyne-azide cycloaddition, popularly known as the ``click{''}
   reaction, has been extensively exploited in molecule/macromolecule

   including biology. Some advantageous characteristics of this coupling
   include high efficiency, and adaptability to the environment in which
   the desired covalent linking of the alkyne and azide terminated moieties
   needs to be carried out. The efficient delivery of active pharmaceutical
   agents to specific organelles, employing nanocarriers developed through
   the use of ``click{''} chemistry, constitutes a continuing topical area

Abstract = {{Alternatives to efficient viral vectors in gene therapy are desired
   because of their poor safety profiles. Chitosan is a promising non-viral
   nucleotide delivery vector because Fits biocompatibility,
   biodegradability, low immunogenicity and ease of manufacturing. Since
   the transfection efficiency of chitosan polyplexes is relatively low
   compared to viral counterparts, there is an impetus to gain a better
   understanding of the structure-performance relationship. Recent progress
   in preparation and characterisation has enabled coupling analysis of
   chitosans structural parameters that has led to increased TE by
   tailoring of chitosan's structure. In this review, we summarize the
   recent advances that have lead to a more rational design of chitosan
   polyplexes. We present an integrated review of all major areas of
   chitosan-based transfection, including preparation, chitosan and
   polyplexes physicochemical characterisation, in vitro and in vivo
   assessment. In each, we present the obstacles to efficient transfection
   and the strategies adopted over time to surmount these impediments. (C)

Abstract = {{The goal of this work is to develop a methodical approach for analytical
   soft error sensitivity analysis in SRAM-based FPGAs. Compared to other
   non-destructive techniques, the proposed approach can be applied very
   early in a design flow. This is achieved by extracting information about
   an application under development from high level models (e.g. C/C++
   descriptions or Matlab Simulink models) and then invoking
   pre-established libraries where other information related to soft error
   sensitivity of primitive components are stored beforehand. Our
   library-based approach is validated by comparing our early estimation
   results to those obtained through synthesis, placement and routing of
   complete designs, for two different ways of estimating the number of
   potentially critical configuration bits. We first explore two different
   design architectures for implementing Finite Impulse Response filters.
   The design architectures are explored under two different implementation
   options, for a Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA: LUT based and DSP48E block based.
   Then we apply our estimation technique on a more complex design. namely
   a GMSK demodulator. Results show that the worst case relative error,
   caused by our estimation technique with respect to the results obtained
   after synthesis, placement and routing is 7,2 \%, and in most cases, it
   is less than 5 \%. Mean time between failures are provided for the
   different design architecture and implementation options, to illustrate
   how our technique can help designers make early choices to build more
   reliable designs without performing the whole implementation, as our
   early estimation results are close to those obtained later in the design
   process.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an original time-sensitive traffic management

   applications require to deal with data streams that may be subject to

   An expert provides imprecise labels based on video recordings of the

   class-and the stability of learning in a stream, this paper presents new
   ensemble methods based on incremental algorithms that rely on their
   sensitivity to the processing order of instances. Different data
   selection criteria, many used in active learning methods, are studied in
   a comprehensive experimental evaluation, including benchmark datasets
   from the UCI machine learning repository and the prediction of severity
   indicators. The best performance is obtained with a criterion that
   selects instances which are misclassified by the current hypothesis. The

Abstract = {{Distribution system state estimation (DSSE) is becoming an essential
   element of many distribution management systems (DMS), serving as the
   basis of numerous smart grid applications. In this paper, a new DSSE
   approach is proposed based on the modified augmented nodal analysis
   formulation, which is known to have advantageous numerical
   characteristics. Special consideration is given to the estimation of
   transformer and regulator tap positions, as they are seldom telemetered
   on the distribution level. The proposed approach can be easily derived
   from existing power flow and short-circuit calculation algorithms, thus

   The proposed DSSE algorithm is tested on the IEEE 8500-Node Test Feeder,

Abstract = {{Increased insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signalling has been observed
   in breast cancer, including endocrine-responsive cancers, and has been
   linked to disease progression and recurrence. In particular, IGF-1 has
   the ability to induce and promote lymphangiogenesis through the
   induction of vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGFC). In the
   present study, we analyzed serum and tumour samples from 60 patients
   with endocrine-positive breast cancer to determine the expression and
   the possible relationship of circulating IGF-1, IGF binding protein 3
   (IGFBP3), and VEGFC with the presence of lymphatic metastasis and other
   immunohistochemical parameters. The analysis revealed a clear and
   significant correlation between high basal levels of IGF-1, IGFBP3, and
   VEGFC and lymph node metastasis in endocrine-responsive breast cancer.
   In addition, expression of those molecules was significantly higher in
   breast cancer patients than in healthy control subjects. Those findings
   may enable more accurate prediction of prognosis in patients with breast
   cancer.}},

   dependency of the radiation efficiency of an infinitesimal horizontal
   electric dipole on grounded and ungrounded substrates versus the

   the observed radiation efficiency is explained with the help of a novel
   substrate dipole approach, which reduces the actual structure to an
   equivalent source dipole composed of the original dipole and the
   substrate dipole radiating into free space. Finally, two solutions for
   enhancing the efficiency at electrical thicknesses where the efficiency

   Matrix Formulation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{485-492}},

Abstract = {{Inventory data and characterization factors in life cycle assessment
   (LCA) contain considerable uncertainty. The most common method of
   parameter uncertainty propagation to the impact scores is Monte Carlo
   simulation, which remains a resource-intensive option-probably one of
   the reasons why uncertainty assessment is not a regular step in LCA. An
   analytical approach based on Taylor series expansion constitutes an
   effective means to overcome the drawbacks of the Monte Carlo method.
   This project aimed to test the approach on a real case study, and the
   resulting analytical uncertainty was compared with Monte Carlo results.
   The sensitivity and contribution of input parameters to output
   uncertainty were also analytically calculated. This article outlines an
   uncertainty analysis of the comparison between two case study scenarios.
   We conclude that the analytical method provides a good approximation of
   the output uncertainty. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis reveals that
   the uncertainty of the most sensitive input parameters was not initially
   considered in the case study. The uncertainty analysis of the comparison
   of two scenarios is a useful means of highlighting the effects of
   correlation on uncertainty calculation. This article shows the
   importance of the analytical method in uncertainty calculation, which
   could lead to a more complete uncertainty analysis in LCA practice.}},

Journal = {{BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{142}},
Pages = {{390-399}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the techno-economics of greenfield projects of an
   integrated first and second-generation sugarcane biorefinery in which
   pentose sugars obtained from sugarcane biomass are used either for
   biogas (consumed internally in the power boiler) or n-butanol production
   via the ABE batch fermentation process. The complete sugarcane
   biorefinery was simulated using Aspen Plus (R). Although the pentoses
   stream available in the sugarcane biorefinery gives room for a
   relatively small biobutanol plant (7.1-12 thousand tonnes per year), the
   introduction of butanol and acetone to the product portfolio of the
   biorefinery increased and diversified its revenues. Whereas the IRR of
   the investment on a biorefinery with biogas production is 11.3\%, IRR
   varied between 13.1\% and 15.2\% in the butanol production option,
   depending on technology (regular or engineered microorganism with
   improved butanol yield and pentoses conversion) and target market
   (chemicals or automotive fuels). Additional discussions include the
   effects of energy-efficient technologies for butanol processing on the
   profitability of the biorefinery. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents performance of steel buildings and nonstructural
   elements during the 27 February 2010 Maule Earthquake in Chile.
   Structural steel buildings are not common in Chile, due to the
   relatively high cost of material. The majority of damage to steel
   structures was observed in industrial facilities. In general, the
   structural steel buildings performed well. Limited damage was observed
   in some of the older buildings. Extensive damage was sustained by
   nonstructural elements, including masonry infill walls, suspended
   ceilings, partition walls, and architectural features. Brick masonry
   partition walls, commonly used in Chilean buildings, suffered damage
   when used in frame buildings with little drift control. The paper
   presents a summary of observed damage and a comparison of Chilean and
   Canadian design practices for steel buildings, with lessons drawn from
   observed structural performance.}},

Abstract = {{Matching algorithms play a fundamental role in many important but

   analysis and model comparison. We present MADMatch, a fast and scalable
   many-to-many approximate diagram matching approach based on an
   error-tolerant graph matching (ETGM) formulation. Diagrams are
   represented as graphs, costs are assigned to possible differences
   between two given graphs, and the goal is to retrieve the cheapest
   matching. We address the resulting optimization problem with a tabu
   search enhanced by the novel use of lexical and structural information.
   Through several case studies with different types of diagrams and tasks,
   we show that our generic approach obtains better results than dedicated
   state-of-the-art algorithms, such as AURA, PLTSDiff, or UMLDiff, on the
   exact same datasets used to introduce (and evaluate) these algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a musculoskeletal pathology. It
   is a complex spinal curvature in a 3-D space that also affects the
   appearance of the trunk. The clinical follow-up of AIS is decisive for
   its management. Currently, the Cobb angle, which is measured from full
   spine radiography, is the most common indicator of the scoliosis
   progression. However, cumulative exposure to X-rays radiation increases
   the risk for certain cancers. Thus, a noninvasive method for the
   identification of the scoliosis progression from trunk shape analysis
   would be helpful. In this study, a statistical model is built from a set
   of healthy subjects using independent component analysis and genetic
   algorithm. Based on this model, a representation of each scoliotic trunk
   from a set of AIS patients is computed and the difference between two
   successive acquisitions is used to determine if the scoliosis has
   progressed or not. This study was conducted on 58 subjects comprising 28
   healthy subjects and 30 AIS patients who had trunk surface acquisitions
   in upright standing posture. The model detects 93\% of the progressive
   cases and 80\% of the nonprogressive cases. Thus, the rate of false
   negatives, representing the proportion of undetected progressions, is
   very low, only 7\%. This study shows that it is possible to perform a
   scoliotic patient's follow-up using 3-D trunk image analysis, which is
   based on a noninvasive acquisition technique.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{65}},

Abstract = {{Exposure to mercury (Hg)-contaminated soils may pose a health risk to
   children by way of oral, dermal, and inhalatory pathways. However, risk
   characterization studies, including contaminant bioaccessibility with
   child-specific exposure parameters and scenarios, are lacking. The
   objectives of this study were (1) to assess children's Hg exposure using
   characterization and oral bioaccessibility data from Hg-contaminated
   soils characterized in previous studies (n = 8); and (2) to characterize
   probabilistic risk in terms of hazard index (HI) considering ingestion,
   dermal, and inhalation pathways. Total Hg concentrations in soils ranged
   from 2.61 to 1.15 x 10(4) mg kg(-1). For moderately contaminated soils
   (S1-S5: Hg a parts per thousand currency sign 12.15 mg kg(-1)), low oral
   bioaccessibility values (1.5-7.5 \%) lead to HI < 1 in all scenarios.
   However, exposure to highly contaminated soils (S6-S8) may pose serious
   risks to children under normal exposure (HI 0.89-66.5) and soil-pica
   behaviour scenarios (HI up to 131). All three pathways significantly
   contributed to the risk. Using total Hg concentrations in calculations
   (assuming 100 \% bioavailability) instead of considering Hg
   bioavailability leads to risk overestimation. Further research on oral,
   inhalatory, and dermal bioavailability of Hg, as well as child play
   behaviour, is recommended to obtain more accurate risk estimates.}},

Title = {{Scenario-based strategic supply chain design and analysis for the forest

Volume = {{144}},

Abstract = {{Supply chain (SC) design involves decisions for the long term, e.g.
   determining products, process technologies, number, location and
   capacity of different SC nodes, production rates, as well as suppliers,
   markets and partners. The forest biorefinery (FBR) is emerging as a new
   possibility for improving forestry companies' business models, however
   introduces significant technological, economic and financial
   challenges-which can be systematically addressed in strategic SC design.
   In order to reduce the burden of such challenges, partnership with
   companies whose expertise brings value and experience to the forestry
   companies' new business model is essential for FBR implementation. In
   this regard, redesigning the forestry SC in order for it to be aligned
   and consistent with the partners SC, and in other words, designing a new
   integrated SC is of crucial importance.
   This paper presents a scenario-based approach to strategic SC design for
   the FBR, designing the SC based on the impacts of the design on
   operational SC activities. Two kinds of scenarios are used; market
   scenarios representing market volatility and SC network scenarios
   (referred to as alternatives) representing different biorefinery
   options/strategies. In order to analyze the impacts of SC alternatives
   on operational activities, a tactical/operational SC model examines the
   advantages and disadvantages of each alternative by exploiting the
   capability of the SC for flexibility in the case of the market scenario
   realization. This demonstrates the impact of each scenario on SC
   profitability. It will also show how integration scenarios may result in
   better economic performances compared to the case when the forestry
   company implements the biorefinery on its own and hence, it reveals how
   forestry companies can benefit from the created synergies. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Introduction: Adequate neuromuscular control of the lumbar spine is
   required to prevent lumbar injuries. A trunk postural stability test has
   been proposed earlier, using a chair wobbling on a central pivot and
   four springs with adjustable positions to modulate task difficulty. An
   inertial sensor is fixed on the chair to measure postural sway. The aim
   of this study is to assess the criterion validity and between-day
   reliability of the calibration and testing components.
   Methods: Thirty six subjects (with and without low back pain) followed a
   calibration procedure, four practice trials and three 60-s trials on 2
   days. The criterion validity of the inertial sensor was tested against
   an optoelectronic system and a force platform. The reliability of 38
   body sway measures obtained from the inertial sensor angular measures
   was estimated.
   Results: The inertial sensor led to valid estimates of postural sway.
   The reliability of the calibration procedure was moderate. Practically
   no learning effect was detected except for a few body sway measures in
   patients with CLBP. Three 60-s trials provided acceptable reliability
   for approximately half of the body sway measures, although this is more
   difficult to achieve in patients with CLBP.
   Discussion: The use of an easy to use inertial sensor led to valid
   measures of postural sway. A number of body sway measures were
   identified as reliable tools for individual follow-ups but inter-subject
   comparisons were anticipated as more difficult when patients with CLBP
   are involved. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The stable-set problem is an NP-hard problem that arises in numerous
   areas such as social networking, electrical engineering, environmental
   forest planning, bioinformatics clustering and prediction, and
   computational chemistry. While some relaxations provide high-quality
   bounds, they result in very large and expensive conic optimization
   problems. We describe and test an integrated interior-point
   cutting-plane method that efficiently handles the large number of
   nonnegativity constraints in the popular doubly-nonnegative relaxation.
   This algorithm identifies relevant inequalities dynamically and
   selectively adds new constraints in a build-up fashion. We present
   computational results showing the significant benefits of this approach
   in comparison to a standard interior-point cutting-plane method.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical and numerical investigation is conducted to study the
   effect of an electromagnetic field on natural convection in a horizontal
   shallow porous cavity filled with an electrically conducting fluid. The
   magnetic field is assumed to be induced by two long wires, carrying
   current, parallel to the horizontal boundaries of the system. A uniform
   heat flux is applied to the horizontal walls of the layer while the
   vertical walls are adiabatic. The governing parameters of the problem
   under study are the thermal Rayleigh number, Ra, Hartmann number, Ha,
   position of the electrical wires, d, current intensity ratio, r, and
   aspect ratio of cavity, A. An analytical solution, valid for a shallow
   layer (A a parts per thousand << 1), is derived on the basis of the
   parallel flow approximation. The critical Rayleigh number, Ra (c) , for
   the onset of motion is derived in closed form in terms of the parameters
   of the problem. For finite-amplitude convection the heat and flow
   characteristics predicted by the analytical model are found to agree
   well with a numerical study of the full governing equations.}},

Abstract = {{Lattice Boltzmann models for simulating multiphase flows are relatively
   new, and much work remains to be done to demonstrate their ability to
   solve fundamental test cases before they are considered for engineering
   problems. From this perspective, a hydrodynamic lattice Boltzmann model
   for simulating immiscible multiphase flows with high density and high
   viscosity ratios, up to O(1000) and O(100) respectively, is presented
   and validated against analytical solutions. The method is based on a two
   phase flow model with operators extended to handle N immiscible fluids.
   The current approach is O(N) in computational complexity for the number
   of different gradient approximations. This is a major improvement,
   considering the O(N-2) complexity found in most works. A sequence of
   systematic and essential tests have been conducted to establish
   milestones that need to be met by the proposed approach (as well as by
   other methods). First, the method is validated qualitatively by
   demonstrating its ability to address the spinodal decomposition of
   immiscible fluids. Second, the model is quantitatively verified for the
   case of multilayered planar interfaces. Third, the multiphase Laplace
   law is studied for the case of three fluids. Fourth, a quality index is
   developed for the three-phase Laplace-Young's law, which concerns the
   position of the interfaces between the fluids resulting from the
   different surface tensions. The current model is compatible with the
   analytical solution, and is shown to be first order accurate in terms of
   this quality index. Finally, the multilayered Couette's flow is studied.
   In this study, numerical results can recover the analytical solutions
   for all the selected test cases, as long as unit density ratios are
   considered. For high density and high viscosity ratios, the analytical
   solution is recovered for all tests, except that of the multilayered
   Couette's flow. Numerical results and a discussion are presented for
   this unsuccessful test case. It is believed that other LB models may
   have the same problem in addressing the simulation of multiphase flows
   with variable density ratios. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The color stability of all-phosphor white organic light-emitting diodes
   (WOLEDs) is crucial and remains a challenge that must be overcome before
   the wide application of phosphor WOLEDs technology. Besides, color
   stable all-phosphor WOLEDs should also offer high color rendering index
   (CRI) and ideal correlated color temperature (CCT) simultaneously to
   make the technology competitive against other alternative technologies
   such as inorganic LEDs. In this work, we demonstrate a series of color
   stable all-phosphor WOLEDs with two emitters (blue and yellow), three
   emitters (blue, green/red, and yellow) and four emitters (blue, green,
   yellow and red) by introducing tris (phenylpyrazole) Iridium
   {[}Ir(ppz)(3)] as interlayer. The results show that appropriate
   thickness of Ir(ppz)(3) interlayer not only can control exciton
   distribution in the emission zone, but also can improve the spectra
   stability. In particular, one efficient four-color device with
   double-interlayer yields fairly high CRI of 92 and 90, ideal CCT of 3703
   K and 3962 K at illumination-relevant luminance of 100 cd m(-2) and 1000
   cd m(-2), respectively, which is very appropriate to indoor lighting
   application. By further employing appropriate hosts to regulate the
   carrier injection, ultrahigh stable four-color devices with applicable
   CRI are finally achieved. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In order to study the effects of particle properties on the solid
   particle erosion mechanisms of brittle bulk materials, six target
   materials were tested using two different powders (alumina and glass) at
   velocities ranging from 25 to 75 m/s. Following in depth
   characterizations of the targets and of the particles before and after
   testing, it was found that lateral fracture was the dominant material
   removal mechanism as predicted by the elasto-plastic theory of erosion.
   In the case of glass powder, for which the hardness of the particle is
   lower than the hardness of the target, particle deformation and
   fragmentation were found to be important factors explaining lower
   erosion rates. The higher than predicted velocity exponents point toward
   a velocity-dependent damage accumulation mechanism which was found to be
   correlated to target yield pressure (H (3) /E (2)). Although damage
   accumulation seems to be necessary for material removal when using both
   powders, the effect is more pronounced for the softer glass powder
   because of kinetic energy dissipation through different means.}},

Abstract = {{Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifactorial disease known to result
   from a variety of factors. Although age is the principal risk factor,
   other etiological mechanisms have been identified, including gene
   mutations and exposure to toxins. Deregulation of energy metabolism,
   mostly through the loss of complex I efficiency, is involved in disease
   progression in both the genetic and sporadic forms of the disease. In
   this study, we investigated energy deregulation in the cerebral tissue
   of animal models (genetic and toxin induced) of PD using an approach
   that combines metabolomics and mathematical modelling. In a first step,
   quantitative measurements of energy-related metabolites in mouse brain
   slices revealed most affected pathways. A genetic model of PD, the Park2
   knockout, was compared to the effect of CCCP, a complex I blocker. Model
   simulated and experimental results revealed a significant and sustained
   decrease in ATP after CCCP exposure, but not in the genetic mice model.
   In support to data analysis, a mathematical model of the relevant
   metabolic pathways was developed and calibrated onto experimental data.
   In this work, we show that a short-term stress response in nucleotide
   scavenging is most probably induced by the toxin exposure. In turn, the
   robustness of energy-related pathways in the model explains how genetic
   perturbations, at least in young animals, are not sufficient to induce
   significant changes at the metabolite level.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio (CR) systems allow unlicensed secondary users to

   scheme considers one multi-antenna relay node that, by selecting the
   antenna(s) to use, can assist either the primary, the secondary or both
   transmissions simultaneously. Expressions of the conditional primary
   outage probability for Rayleigh fading channels are derived and used to

Abstract = {{The impact of outdated channel state information (CSI) on the
   performance of variable-rate adaptive M-ary quadrature amplitude
   modulation in amplify-and-forward (AF) opportunistic relaying systems

   is based on the receiver's CSI, the transmission rate is selected based
   on the predicted CSI at the transmitter after the feedback delay. The
   impact of imperfect CSI prediction on the system performance is also
   evaluated. For each scheme, analytical expressions are derived for the
   average spectral efficiency, outage probability and the average

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{81}},

Month = {{JUL 20}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates natural convection in a shallow porous cavity
   filled with a binary fluid. Constant fluxes of heat and concentration
   are imposed on the vertical walls of the enclosure. Both
   double-diffusive convection and Soret-induced convection are considered.
   An analytical solution, valid for shallow enclosures, is derived on the
   basis of the parallel flow approximation. The work focuses, among other
   things, on the existence of multiple solutions when the buoyancy ratio
   is in the vicinity of phi = -1, for which a trivial steady state
   solution corresponding to the rest state exists. For this particular
   value of phi, it is well known that the onset of motion occurs above a
   subcritical Rayleigh number. The present analytical model reveals that,
   under certain conditions, such a subcritical Rayleigh number also exists
   when phi < -1. In the range of the governing parameters considered in
   this study, a good agreement is found between the analytical predictions
   and the numerical results obtained by solving the full governing
   equations. Heat, solute and flow characteristics predicted by the
   analytical model are found to agree well with a numerical study of the
   full governing equations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Transmission through a subwavelength terahertz fiber, which is
   positioned in parallel to a frequency selective surface, is studied
   using several finite element tools. Both the band diagram technique and
   the portbased scattering matrix technique are used to explain the nature
   of various resonances in the fiber transmission spectrum. First, we
   observe that spectral positions of most of the transmission peaks in the
   port-based simulation can be related to the positions of Van Hove
   singularities in the band diagram of a corresponding infinite periodic
   system. Moreover, spectral shape of most of the features in the fiber
   transmission spectrum can be explained by superposition of several
   Fano-type resonances. We also show that center frequencies and
   bandwidths of these resonances and, as a consequence, spectral shape of
   the resulting transmission features can be tuned by varying the
   fiber-metamaterial separation. (C) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a variety of chromium-free protective coatings were

   prepared by chemical vapor deposition. A series of laboratory tests
   including hardness, micro scratch, pin-on-disk and electrochemical
   polarization measurements were performed in order to compare the
   performance of the different coatings. In addition, mechanical
   resistance and fatigue resistance were evaluated using prototype valves
   with coated ball under severe tribo-corrosion conditions. It was shown
   that W/WC coating exhibits superior resistance to wear and corrosion due
   to high hardness and high resistance to pitting, respectively while NCP
   exhibits better wear resistance than HC with alumina ball and low
   corrosion potential which allow to use it as protective (sacrificial)
   coating. Both nanostructured coatings exhibited attractive

Abstract = {{A theoretical model for dc conductivity under high electric field in
   chalcogenide glasses is developed. This model, of correlated barrier
   hopping is used to treat both low field conductivity, which obeys
   Meyer-Neldel rule (MNR), and high field Poole-Frenkel (PF) effect. Both
   are incorporated in one model because the origin of electronic emission
   is the same: a deep well in which a polaron is trapped. We show that the
   characteristic temperatures associated with MNR and PF should be the
   same, as has been predicted using a rigorous adiabatic polaron hopping
   model, and previously demonstrated experimentally for fullerene films.
   We also predict that the extrapolated conductivity prefactors will be
   the same in the two cases. Experimental evidence from the literature
   suggests, but does not demonstrate conclusively, that the two
   predictions are satisfied for chalcogenide glasses. Finally, we
   interpret the result in terms of the multi-excitation entropy model for
   MNR. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Metrics for evaluating the forest biorefinery supply chain performance}},

Abstract = {{For sustainable decision-making regarding biorefinery strategies,
   different criteria, i.e. economic, environmental, social, should be
   considered. However, the economic criteria typically do not consider
   market volatility, whereas today's market involves price and demand
   volatilities. Biorefinery strategies must be flexible to be robust to
   market volatility. Therefore, relevant metrics must be developed to
   quantify the system's performance against volatility. This paper
   presents metrics of flexibility and robustness which analyze the
   performance of the supply chain in a dynamic environment, providing
   additional information along with economic metrics. In this paper, the
   link between the two metrics, and how profitability and robustness
   change with flexibility are discussed. The results reveal that, although
   profitability does not always increase with more flexibility and there
   is an optimum level of flexibility, the system's robustness is improved
   by increasing flexibility. Moreover, a ``conditional value-at-risk{''}
   parameter is introduced to show what patterns of sale lead to highest
   profit and robustnestness. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Four data-mining approaches for wind turbine power curve monitoring are
   compared. Power curve monitoring can be applied to evaluate the turbine
   power output and detect deviations, causing financial loss. In this
   research, cluster center fuzzy logic, neural network, and kappa-nearest
   neighbor models are built and their performance compared against
   literature. Recently developed adaptive neuro-fuzzy-interference system
   models are set up and their performance compared with the other models,
   using the same data. Literature models often neglect the influence of
   the ambient temperature and the wind direction. The ambient temperature
   can influence the power output up to 20\%. Nearby obstacles can lower
   the power output for certain wind directions. The approaches proposed in
   literature and the ANFIS models are compared by using wind speed only
   and two additional inputs. The comparison is based on the mean absolute
   error, root mean squared error, mean absolute percentage error, and
   standard deviation using data coming from three pitch regulated turbines
   rating 2 MW each. The ability to highlight performance deviations is
   investigated by use of real measurements. The comparison shows the
   decrease of error rates and of the ANFIS models when taking into account
   the two additional inputs and the ability to detect faults earlier.}},

Abstract = {{Single base mismatched oligonucleotides related to the rpoB gene of
   Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the mutations of which cause drug resistance
   of the infectious agent, were detected and discriminated using a surface
   plasmon resonance biosensor system. Thiol-modified oligonucleotides of
   the selected sequence (the probe) and 1-mercapto-6-hexanol were
   immobilized on a gold sensor surface. Hybridization between immobilized
   probe P2 and perfectly matched target T2 as well as a single base
   mismatched target TN was investigated in buffer solutions of various
   stringencies. Discrimination of perfectly matched and single base
   mismatched targets is achieved due to a difference in the level of their
   hybridization with the immobilized probe depending on stringency of the
   buffer solution. In 0.5xSSC buffer solution (7.5 mM sodium citrate, pH
   7, containing 75 mM NaCl), sensor response at T2 injection into the
   measuring sensor cell was 16 times that at TN injection. The
   experimental results on surface hybridization between the studied
   oligonucleotides demonstrated a good correlation with theoretical
   calculations of thermodynamic parameters of these interactions in the
   solution. The described approach could be proposed as a basis for
   creating a biosensor for real-time label-free diagnostics of

Abstract = {{We propose a novel way to consider the max-min fairness (MMF) paradigm
   in traffic engineering. Since MMF appears as a reference model for a
   fair capacity allocation when the traffic flows are elastic and rates
   are adapted based on resource availability, we consider it as a
   requirement due to the way resources are shared by the distributed rate
   control scheme (like that of the transport protocol), rather than the
   routing objective. In particular, we define the traffic engineering
   problem where, given a network topology with link capacities and a set
   of elastic traffic demands to route, we must select a single path for
   each demand so as to maximize a network utility function, assuming an
   MMF bandwidth allocation. We propose a compact mixed-integer linear
   programming formulation as well as a restricted path formulation. We
   show with computational experiments that the exact formulation can be
   solved in a reasonable amount of computing time for medium-size networks
   and that the restricted path model provides solutions of comparable
   quality much faster.}},

Abstract = {{In this work two types of montmorillonite, a pristine and an
   organo-modified clay (Cloisite 30B), were employed to produce
   (polyethylene terephthalate)-based nanocomposites via in situ
   polymerization. Using water as an intermediate medium, a stable
   dispersion of pristine clay in ethylene glycol was achieved. However,
   after polymerization, no significant gain was obtained in terms of
   delamination of silicate platelets. The polycondensation reaction when
   using Cloisite 30B was carried out at a temperature as low as 250
   degrees C in order to retain a considerable portion of the
   organo-modifier. The results showed that Cloisite 30B was successfully
   intercalated by the polymer chains, resulting in a d-spacing increase
   from 1.9 nm to about 3.6 nm. Although some mono and double silicate
   layers were observed in microscopy images, the major part of the
   organoclay remained in a tactoid intercalated form. Sampling during the
   polycondensation reaction revealed that, in this process, clay was first
   swelled efficiently by the monomer, and this structure was preserved in
   the early stage of polycondensation. However, the silicate platelets
   collapsed with time as the polycondensation progressed and larger
   molecular weight oligomers were formed. An investigation on the type of
   impeller used in the polymerization process showed that a slight
   improvement was achieved in terms of aggregate size and distribution
   when the anchor impeller was replaced by a helical one.}},

Abstract = {{A newly developed two-dimensional ice accretion and antiicing simulation
   code, CANICE2D-NS, is presented. The method is used to predict iced
   airfoil shapes and performance degradation with a multistep approach. A
   multiblock Navier-Stokes code, NSMB, has been coupled with the CANICE2D
   icing framework, supplementing the existing panel method-based flow
   solver. Attention is paid to the roughness implementation within the
   turbulence model and to the convergence of the steady and quasi-steady
   iterative procedure. The new coupling allows fully automated multilayer
   icing simulation, whereas also permitting flow analysis and performance
   prediction of iced airfoils. Effects of uniform surface roughness in
   quasi-steady ice accretion simulation are analyzed through different
   validation test cases. The results demonstrates the benefits and
   robustness of the new framework in predicting ice shapes and aerodynamic
   performance parameters, as well as iced airfoil surface pressure
   coefficients. Finally, the convergence of the quasi-steady algorithm is
   verified and identifies the need for an order of magnitude increase in
   the number of multitime steps in icing simulations.}},

Title = {{Optical imaging of acute epileptic networks in mice}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The potential of intrinsic optical imaging and resting-state analysis
   under anesthetized conditions as a tool to study brain networks
   associated with epileptic seizures is investigated. Using an acute model
   of epileptiform activity, the 4-aminopyridine model in live mice, we
   observe the changes in resting-state networks with the onset of seizure
   activity and in conditions of spiking activity. Resting-state networks
   identified before and after the onset of epileptiform activity show both
   decreased and increased homologous correlations, with a small dependence
   on seizure intensity. The observed changes are not uniform across the
   different hemodynamic measures, suggesting a potential decoupling
   between blood flow and metabolism in the low-frequency networks. This
   study supports the need for a more extensive investigation of epileptic
   networks including more than one independent hemodynamic measurement.

Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{While macrophages have been implicated in the failure of bioprosthetic
   heart valves, the macrophage response to crosslinked native pericardial
   collagen has not been previously investigated. Using decellularized
   bovine pericardium (DBP) as a model for native collagen, this study
   investigated the response of macrophage-like cells (U937s) to DBP,
   either: (i) untreated, or (ii) exogenously crosslinked with
   glutaraldehyde or 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC).
   We have previously validated the use of U937 cells as models for the
   response of human monocyte-derived macrophages to decellularized
   pericardial materials and, per our previous work, differentiated the
   U937 cells directly on the three material surfaces. After 72 h in
   culture, the cells and medium were analyzed for DNA content, acid
   phosphatase activity, and cytokine and matrix metalloproteinase release.
   As well, cell/substrate samples were fixed for SEM. Fewer cells attached
   to or survived on the glutaraldehyde-treated substrate, and some showed
   an abnormal morphology compared to cells cultured on the other surfaces.
   Further, cells on glutaraldehyde-treated surfaces released more
   pro-inflammatory cytokines, more MMP-1 and less MMP-2 and MMP-9. The
   poor performance of the U937 macrophage-like cells on the
   glutaraldehyde-treated surfaces appears to be due to surface
   characteristics rather than to soluble aldehyde or other components
   leaching from the crosslinked material. These results provide evidence
   that crosslinking with glutaraldehyde is cytotoxic to macrophage-like
   cells, and that crosslinking with a zero-length crosslinker like EDC can
   be an acceptable alternative crosslinking treatment for biomaterials.

   unwanted specular reflection on the size of the patches is examined.
   Moreover, in a global analysis of the reflectarray, we show that this

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the early repair
   response of cartilage defects in trochlea (TR) and medial femoral
   condyle (MFC) at 2-3 weeks after bone marrow stimulation.
   Design: Bilateral full-thickness cartilage defects were generated in
   central trochlear groove and MFC of skeletally mature rabbits. Four
   subchondral perforations were made on each defect, either by
   micro-fracture to 2 mm deep, or by drilling to 2 mm or 6 mm deep.
   Rabbits were sacrificed either on Day 14 post-operatively or on Day 21.
   Defects were analyzed by histology, stereology, histomorphometry and
   micro-computed tomography (CT). Intact femurs (N = 4) served as
   controls.
   Results: Stromal cell density recruitment was similar in all defects,
   irrespective of defect location and surgical techniques used. There was
   a robust appearance of chondrocytes at Day 21 in TR defects with
   significantly higher volume fraction of chondrocytes in TR compared to
   MFC (P = 0.013). Chondrogenic foci were observed in marrow penetrating
   holes, with a significantly higher frequency and larger foci in TR vs
   MFC defects at Day 21 (P = 0.043 and P = 0.0014, respectively). Micro-CT
   analysis showed that deep drilling elicited significantly more
   mineralized bone fill compared to shallower perforations at 2 and 3
   weeks repair (all at P <= 0.0008).
   Conclusions: Bone marrow stimulation induced greater chondrogenesis in
   TR vs MFC defects in adult rabbits, with more chondrocytes and larger
   chondrogenic foci appearing in TR vs MFC on Day 21 post-operation. (C)

Abstract = {{The potential effectiveness for long-term closure of a desulphurized
   tailings cover placed on reactive tailings at the Detour Lake Mine was
   assessed. The single-layer cover was aimed at reducing oxygen ingress
   using high water saturation to limit oxygen diffusion and consumption of
   oxygen in the cover by residual sulphide minerals. The cover was 1.0 to
   1.5 m thick and met desulphurization targets, but was coarser grained
   than the design. One-dimensional unsaturated flow and oxygen diffusion
   modelling was used to predict water content profiles, depth of oxygen
   penetration, and diffusive oxygen fluxes. Effective diffusion and
   reaction rate coefficients estimated from field data matched laboratory
   measurements. Depth to water table was identified as the most important
   factor for reducing tailings oxidation. The deeper (4 m) water tables
   measured at the cover edges led to a lower degree of saturation and
   higher oxygen flux. Finer grain size and higher air-entry values in the
   cover materials helped maintain saturation, and a capillary break (fine
   over coarse) cover reduced oxygen fluxes to <5\% of fluxes to uncovered
   tailings. The as-built cover (coarse over fine) reduced oxygen influx by
   at most 50\% and as low as <1\% of uncovered tailings.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the performance of three compacted clay liners for
   holding and treating municipal wastewater in three lagoons. The quality
   controls for the liners included verification of compaction conditions
   (dry density and water content) and full-scale leakage tests. These were
   made by filling each lagoon with clear water and monitoring the leakage
   rate versus water level in the lagoon. This paper presents the quality
   control data, the predicted local values of the hydraulic conductivity k
   versus void ratio e, and degree of saturation S-r as achieved by
   compaction, and a statistical prediction of the large-scale k value for
   each liner. For this case history, one full-scale test was performed
   before winter and the measured large-scale k value agreed with the
   predicted value. Two full-scale tests were performed the following
   spring, and revealed that frost had seriously damaged the liners of the
   two lagoons, which had been left empty during winter. The paper thus
   validates a previously proposed model for predicting hydraulic
   conductivity, and it also provides a statistical approach to predict the
   large-scale k value of undamaged clay liners.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a novel approach for segmenting articulated spine shape
   models from medical images. A nonlinear low-dimensional manifold is
   created from a training set of mesh models to establish the patterns of
   global shape variations. Local appearance is captured from neighborhoods
   in the manifold once the overall representation converges. Inference
   with respect to the manifold and shape parameters is performed using a
   higher-order Markov random field (HOMRF). Singleton and pairwise
   potentials measure the support from the global data and shape coherence
   in manifold space respectively, while higher-order cliques encode
   geometrical modes of variation to segment each localized vertebra
   models. Generic feature functions learned from ground-truth data assigns
   costs to the higher-order terms. Optimization of the model parameters is
   achieved using efficient linear programming and duality. The resulting
   model is geometrically intuitive, captures the statistical distribution
   of the underlying manifold and respects image support. Clinical
   experiments demonstrated promising results in terms of spine
   segmentation. Quantitative comparison to expert identification yields an
   accuracy of 1.6 +/- 0.6 mm for CT imaging and of 2.0 +/- 0.8 mm for MR
   imaging, based on the localization of anatomical landmarks.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new robust control strategy for an islanded
   microgrid in the presence of load unmodeled dynamics. The microgrid
   consists of parallel connection of several electronically interfaced
   distributed generation units and a local load. The load is
   parametrically uncertain and topologically unknown and, thus, is the
   source of unmodeled dynamics. The objective is to design a robust
   controller to regulate the load voltage in the presence of unmodeled
   dynamics. To achieve the objective, the problem is first characterized
   by a two-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) feedback-feedforward controller. The
   2DOF control design problem is then transformed to a nonconvex
   optimization problem. Furthermore, the nonconvex optimization problem is
   reduced to a convex linear matrix inequality-based optimization problem
   which can be easily solved. To achieve optimal performance for the
   system, unlike the most conventional 2DOF design approaches, the
   feedback and feedforward controllers are jointly designed. Finally,
   simulation case studies performed in the MATLAB/SimPowerSystems Toolbox
   show that the proposed control scheme is strongly robust against
   uncertainties in the load parameters and against the unknown dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the effect of electrospun polyethylene terephthalate

   diameters (740 +/- 200 nm and 1.8 +/- 0.2 mu m); orientations (low and
   high); NaOH-treated and untreated were prepared. NaOH treatment altered
   mats physical properties. AlamarBlue assay revealed that all four test
   mats supported cell adhesion and growth. Cell growth was observed to be
   faster for mat with large fiber diameter than for the small fiber
   diameter mat. Fluorescent staining and scanning electron microscopy
   showed that fiber diameter and orientation influenced cell morphology.
   Cells were randomly spread on the 740-nm diameter fibers whereas most of
   them were oriented along the fibers with 1.8 mu m diameter. Mat with
   higher fiber alignment showed higher cell orientation. Cells penetrated
   into the mats having 1.8 +/- 0.2 mu m fiber diameter but remained on the
   surface of the mat with 740 +/- 200 nm, as determined from histological
   analysis. These findings highly suggest that the two mats may be

Abstract = {{We produced six different composites of p-type bismuth antimony
   telluride alloys and studied their structure and thermoelectric
   properties. The components of the composites were obtained in powder
   form by mechanical alloying. Mixed powders of two different compositions
   were consolidated by hot extrusion to obtain each bulk composite. The
   minimum grain size of bulk composites as revealed by scanning electron
   microscopy shows a 50\% reduction compared with the conventional
   (Bi0.2Sb0.8)(2)Te-3. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis only shows peak
   broadening with no clear indication of separate phases, and indicates a
   systematic decrease of crystallite size in the composite materials.
   Scattering mechanisms of charge carriers were evaluated by Hall-effect
   measurements. The thermoelectric properties were investigated via the
   Harman method from 300 K up to 460 K. The composites show no significant
   degradation of the power factor and high peak ZT values ranging from
   0.86 to 1.04. The thermal conductivity of the composites slightly
   increases with respect to the conventional alloy. This unexpected
   behavior can be attributed to two factors: (1) the composites do not yet
   contain a significant number of grains whose sizes are sufficiently
   small to increase phonon scattering, and (2) each of the combined
   components of the composites corresponds to a phase with thermal
   conductivity higher than the minimum value corresponding to the
   (Bi0.2Sb0.8)(2)Te-3 alloy.}},

   the basal (00l) planes of the hexagonal crystal cell oriented parallel

   orientation factor, f, by the Lotgering method, increased with
   decreasing final thickness of the samples. It was about f = 45\% for

Abstract = {{Microwave sintering is well known as an expeditious process in
   applications involving ceramics and biomaterials. For powders in the
   nanometer range, rapid microwave heating could reduce material exposure
   to elevated temperatures, thus preserving nanostructures in the
   resulting materials. To investigate the potential of this technique for
   thermoelectric (TE) materials, we have prepared samples of
   bismuth-telluride- and lead-telluride-based alloys from powders, for
   both materials, having sizes of partially agglomerated particles
   distributed from 0.15 mu m to 7 mu m. Sintering of the cold-pressed
   powders was carried out in a microwave furnace for 900 s at temperatures
   in the range of 583 K to 623 K for bismuth telluride and 793 K to 813 K
   for lead telluride specimens. For optimized sintering times and
   temperatures, the samples obtained showed relative densities of almost
   95\%. Scanning electron microscopy shows some residual porosity and a
   reduction of grain size, up to a factor of 5 for PbTe, compared with
   optimized hot-extruded specimens. For bismuth telluride samples, the TE
   performance in the range of 300 K to 460 K is poor, which is attributed
   to the arbitrary texture obtained from cold pressing of a highly
   anisotropic alloy prior to its sintering. In contrast, PbTe exhibits
   isotropic properties, hence deficiency of texturing is not expected to
   have a negative impact on its TE properties. Harman measurements show a
   value of ZT = 0.42 at 617 K for PbTe p-type sintered samples, which is
   comparable to hot-extruded alloys from similar powders. The present work
   demonstrates that microwave sintering is a promising alternative to
   other powder consolidation techniques for polycrystalline materials
   exhibiting isotropic TE properties.}},

Abstract = {{The approach of using segmented legs to build thermoelectric (TE)
   modules can enhance the performance of TE generators. This approach is
   based on the selection of materials for different segments that are
   optimized in terms of their TE properties with respect to the
   temperature range to which they are exposed during module operation. For
   this purpose, by carefully controlling the chemical composition of
   ternary and quaternary bismuth-telluride-based alloys, we have optimized
   the figure of merit ZT of p-type and n-type alloys implemented by a
   powder technology approach. The alloys were prepared by mechanical
   alloying followed by hot extrusion, and their mechanical and TE
   properties were fully characterized as a function of temperature, which
   gave us a solid database for simulation of modules containing these
   materials. Finite-element numerical simulation was applied to evaluate
   the impact of TE materials properties on the level of mechanical
   stresses generated by thermal gradients in modules made of segmented
   legs. Keeping the same total length of two-segment p- and n-type legs,
   the relative length of each segment was varied to obtain an 8\% relative
   increase of generated electrical power compared with homogeneous legs of
   the same total length. Under these conditions, the presence of solder
   interface between the two segments and between the segments and the
   copper conductors of the module concentrates plastic strain, leading to
   a significant reduction of the stress level in the TE materials compared
   with that resulting from using nonsegmented legs. Leg segmentation not
   only leads to improved TE performance but could also significantly
   modify the maximum values and distribution of thermomechanical stresses
   in the modules, depending on how it is realized. The study presents how
   this numerical simulation tool can be used to optimize the design of
   segmented modules.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the effectiveness of C-enriched subsurfaceflow
   constructed wetlands in reducing high concentrations of nitrate (NO 3 -)
   and sulfate (SO 4 2-) in greenhouse wastewaters. Constructed wetlands
   were filled with pozzolana, planted with common cattail (Typha
   latifolia), and supplemented as follows: (i) constructed wetland with
   sucrose (CW+ S), wetland units with 2 g L-1 of sucrose solution from
   week 1 to 28; (ii) constructed wetland with compost (CW+ C), wetland
   units supplemented with a reactive mixture of compost and sawdust; (iii)
   constructed wetland with compost and no sucrose (CW+ CNS) from week 1 to
   18, and constructed wetland with compost and sucrose (CW+ CS) at 2 g L-1
   from week 19 to 28; and (iv) constructed wetland (CW). During 28 wk, the
   wetlands received a typical reconstituted greenhouse wastewater
   containing 500 mg L-1 SO(4)(2-)and 300 mg L-1 NO3-. In CW+ S, CW+ C, and
   CW+ CS, appropriate C: N ratio (7: 3.4) and redox potential (-53 to 39
   mV) for denitrification resulted in 95 to 99\% NO3- removal. Carbon
   source was not a limiting factor for denitrification in C-enriched
   constructed wetlands. In CW+ S and CW+ CS, the dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC)/SO(4)(2-)ratios of 0.36 and 0.28 resulted in high sulfate-reducing
   bacteria (SRB) counts and high SO 4 2-removal (98\%), whereas low
   activities were observed at DOC/SO(4)(2-)ratios of 0.02 (CW) to 0.11
   (CW+ C, CW+ CNS). On week 19, when organic C content was increased by
   sucrose addition in CW+ CS, SRB counts increased from 2.80 to 5.11
   log{[}CFU+ 1] mL(-1), resulting in a level similar to the one measured
   in CW+ S (4.69 log{[}CFU+ 1] mL(-1)). Consequently, high sulfate
   reduction occurred after denitrification, suggesting that low DOC (38-54
   mg L-1) was the limiting factor. In CW, DOC concentration (9-10 mg L-1)
   was too low to sustain efficient denitrification and, therefore, sulfate
   reduction. Furthermore, the high concentration of dissolved sulfides
   observed in CW+ S and CW+ CS treated waters were eliminated by adding
   FeCl3}},

   The solution to each of these problems is trivially unbounded when the

Abstract = {{As a consequence of the multi-functionality of land, the impact
   assessment of land use in Life Cycle Impact Assessment requires the
   modelling of several impact pathways covering biodiversity and ecosystem
   services. To provide consistency amongst these separate impact pathways,
   general principles for their modelling are provided in this paper. These
   are refinements to the principles that have already been proposed in
   publications by the UNEP-SETAC Life Cycle Initiative. In particular,
   this paper addresses the calculation of land use interventions and land
   use impacts, the issue of impact reversibility, the spatial and temporal
   distribution of such impacts and the assessment of absolute or relative
   ecosystem quality changes. Based on this, we propose a guideline to
   build methods for land use impact assessment in Life Cycle Assessment
   (LCA).
   Recommendations are given for the development of new characterization
   models and for which a series of key elements should explicitly be
   stated, such as the modelled land use impact pathways, the land
   use/cover typology covered, the level of biogeographical differentiation
   used for the characterization factors, the reference land use situation
   used and if relative or absolute quality changes are used to calculate
   land use impacts. Moreover, for an application of the characterisation
   factors (CFs) in an LCA study, data collection should be transparent
   with respect to the data input required from the land use inventory and
   the regeneration times. Indications on how generic CFs can be used for
   the background system as well as how spatial-based CFs can be calculated
   for the foreground system in a specific LCA study and how land use
   change is to be allocated should be detailed. Finally, it becomes
   necessary to justify the modelling period for which land use impacts of
   land transformation and occupation are calculated and how uncertainty is
   accounted for.
   The presented guideline is based on a number of assumptions: Discrete
   land use types are sufficient for an assessment of land use impacts;
   ecosystem quality remains constant over time of occupation; time and
   area of occupation are substitutable; transformation time is negligible;
   regeneration is linear and independent from land use history and
   landscape configuration; biodiversity and multiple ecosystem services
   are independent; the ecological impact is linearly increasing with the
   intervention; and there is no interaction between land use and other
   drivers such as climate change. These assumptions might influence the
   results of land use Life Cycle Impact Assessment and need to be
   critically reflected.
   In this and the other papers of the special issue, we presented the
   principles and recommendations for the calculation of land use impacts
   on biodiversity and ecosystem services on a global scale. In the
   framework of LCA, they are mainly used for the assessment of land use
   impacts in the background system. The main areas for further development
   are the link to regional ecological models running in the foreground
   system, relative weighting of the ecosystem services midpoints and
   indirect land use.}},

Abstract = {{To assess the diverse environmental impacts of land use, a
   standardization of quantifying land use elementary flows is needed in
   life cycle assessment (LCA). The purpose of this paper is to propose how
   to standardize the land use classification and how to regionalize land
   use elementary flows.
   In life cycle inventories, land occupation and transformation are
   elementary flows providing relevant information on the type and location
   of land use for land use impact assessment. To find a suitable land use
   classification system for LCA, existing global land cover classification
   systems and global approaches to define biogeographical regions are
   reviewed.
   A new multi-level classification of land use is presented. It consists
   of four levels of detail ranging from very general global land cover
   classes to more refined categories and very specific categories
   indicating land use intensities. Regionalization is built on five
   levels, first distinguishing between terrestrial, freshwater, and marine
   biomes and further specifying climatic regions, specific biomes,
   ecoregions and finally indicating the exact geo-referenced information
   of land use. Current land use inventories and impact assessment methods
   do not always match and hinder a comprehensive assessment of land use
   impact. A standardized definition of land use types and geographic
   location helps to overcome this gap and provides the opportunity to test
   the optimal resolution of land cover types and regionalization for each
   impact pathway.
   The presented approach provides the necessary flexibility to providers
   of inventories and developers of impact assessment methods. To simplify
   inventories and impact assessment methods of land use, we need to find
   archetypical situations across impact pathways, land use types and
   regions, and aggregate inventory entries and methods accordingly.}},

Abstract = {{Rarely considered in environmental assessment methods, potential land
   use impacts on a series of ecosystem services must be accounted for in
   widely used decision-making tools such as life cycle assessment (LCA).
   The main goal of this study is to provide an operational life cycle
   impact assessment characterization method that addresses land use
   impacts at a global scale by developing spatially differentiated
   characterization factors (CFs) and assessing the extent of their spatial
   variability using different regionalization levels.
   The proposed method follows the recommendations of previous work and
   falls within the framework and principles for land use impact assessment
   established by the United Nations Environment Programme/Society of
   Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry Life Cycle Initiative. Based on
   the spatial approach suggested by Saad et al. (Int J Life Cycle Assess
   16: 198-211, 2011), the intended impact pathways that are modeled
   pertain to impacts on ecosystem services damage potential and focus on
   three major ecosystem services: (1) erosion regulation potential, (2)
   freshwater regulation potential, and (3) water purification potential.
   Spatially-differentiated CFs were calculated for each biogeographic
   region of all three regionalization scale (Holdridge life regions,
   Holdridge life zones, and terrestrial biomes) along with a nonspatial
   world average level. In addition, seven land use types were assessed
   considering both land occupation and land transformation interventions.
   A comprehensive analysis of the results indicates that, when compared to
   all resolution schemes, the world generic averaged CF can deviate for
   various ecosystem types. In the case of groundwater recharge potential
   impacts, this range varied up to factors of 7, 4.7, and 3 when using the
   Holdridge life zones, the Holdridge regions, and the terrestrial biomes
   regionalization levels, respectively. This validates the importance of
   introducing a regionalized assessment and highlights how a finer scale
   increases the level of detail and consequently the discriminating power
   across several biogeographic regions, which could not have been captured
   using a coarser scale. In practice, the implementation of such
   regionalized CFs suggests that an LCA practitioner must identify the
   ecosystem in which land occupation or transformation activities occur in
   addition to the traditional inventory data required-namely, the land use
   activity and the inventory flow.
   The variability of CFs across all three regionalization levels provides
   an indication of the uncertainty linked to nonspatial CFs. Among other
   assumptions and value choices made throughout the study, the use of
   ecological borders over political boundaries was deemed more relevant to
   the interpretation of environmental issues related to specific
   functional ecosystem behaviors.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{118-129}},

Abstract = {{The modified Doorstopper stress measurement technique consists in
   recording the recovered strains caused by stress relief at the bottom of
   a borehole drilled in a rock mass and converting the relieved strains
   into stresses by using the deformability parameters at the measuring
   point. This conversion is usually based on the assumption of a linear
   elastic behaviour. Hence, when plastic strains are induced at or near
   the borehole bottom prior to or during stress relief, the stress tensor
   calculated by assuming an elastic behaviour can be wrong. Plastic
   strains develop at the borehole bottom or in its vicinity, causing local
   damage. Core discing is probably the most visible manifestation of core
   failure, however, even if no visible signs of damage are present,
   plastic strains can be induced at or near the borehole bottom, affecting
   the recovered strains and the calculated stresses. Using Flac(3D), the
   stress relief process for different 3D in situ stress states in an
   elasto-plastic cohesion softening friction hardening model is simulated
   in order to determine if the non-elastic behaviour can be detected
   from.the strain recovery curves. Errors on the far-field stress state
   obtained by assuming an elastic behaviour are calculated. Finally, means
   of minimizing core damage in the presence of high in situ stresses are
   briefly explored and discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Bubbles generated in water by focusing femtosecond and picosecond laser
   pulses in the presence of 100 nm gold nanoparticles have been

   nanoscale, direct observation using optical microscopy is not possible.
   An optical in-situ method has been developed to monitor the
   time-resolved variation in the extinction cross-section of an irradiated
   nanoparticle solution sample. This method is used to measure the bubbles
   lifetime and deduce their average diameter. We show that bubbles
   generated with femtosecond pulses (40-500 fs) last two times longer and
   are larger in average than those generated with picosecond pulses (0.5-5
   ps). Controlling those bubble properties is necessary for optimizing

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the problem of the joint determination of the
   optimal lot sizing and optimal production control policy for an
   unreliable and imperfect manufacturing system, where the quality control
   of lots produced is performed using an acceptance sampling plan. The
   proportion of defective items, the time between failures and the time to
   repair are generally distributed. The incurred total cost includes
   manufacturing cost, transportation cost, inspection costs, rejection
   cost of defective items, replacement cost for returned defective items
   from customers, and holding and backlog costs. The associated cost
   minimization problem is formulated with a stochastic dynamic programming
   model where the lot sizing and production rate are considered as
   decision variables. Given the difficulties in solving such a highly
   stochastic model analytically or numerically, we adopted a modified
   hedging point policy (HPP) to control the production rate, as well as an
   economic lot sizing policy for batch processing control; we also relied
   on a simulation-based experimental approach to determine a close
   approximation of the optimal control parameters. It is shown that
   production should be accelerated at the maximum production rate, not
   only when building the safety stock, as in the classical HPP, but also
   after rejecting a lot, in order to recuperate the loss in inventory and
   to maintain the on-hand safety stock. Numerical experiments and thorough
   sensitivity analyses are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed control policy and the robustness of the resolution approach.
   Some interesting behaviours regarding the impact of different parameters
   on the optimal decision variables are observed and discussed. (C) 2013

   thermodynamic modeling of phase diagrams and thermodynamic properties of
   all oxide phases in the MgO-NiO-SiO2 system at 1 atm total pressure are
   presented. To resolve the contradictions in the literature data, anew
   experimental investigation has been carried out over the temperature
   range from (1400 to 1650) degrees C using an equilibration and quenching
   technique followed by electron probe X-ray microanalysis (EPMA).
   Tie-lines between olivine and monoxide, olivine and proto-pyroxene,
   liquid and olivine and liquid and cristobalite have been measured. The
   whole set of experimental data, including the new experimental results
   and previously published data, has been taken into consideration in
   thermodynamic modeling of oxide phases in the MgO-NiO-SiO2 system. The
   Modified Quasichemical Model has been used for the liquid phase. A
   simple random mixing model with a polynomial expansion of the excess
   Gibbs energy has been used for the monoxide solid solution. The models
   for olivine and proto-pyroxene were developed within the framework of

Abstract = {{The quality of the convergence process in genetic algorithms depends on
   the specific choice of strategies and combinations of operators. In this
   paper, we address this problem and introduce an adaptive evolutionary
   approach that uses a genetic algorithm in an adaptive process. An
   application of this approach to the dynamic vehicle routing problem with
   time windows is presented. We compare the adaptive version of a hybrid
   genetic algorithm with the non-adaptive one with respect to the
   robustness and the quality of the generated solutions. The results
   obtained show the ability of our operator combination adaptation
   approach to produce solutions that are superior to hand-tuning and other
   adaptive methods with respect to performance sensitivity and robustness.

Journal = {{FINITE ELEMENTS IN ANALYSIS AND DESIGN}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{48-61}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Peen forming is a manufacturing process commonly used in the aerospace
   industry to shape large and thin panels such as wing and fuselage skins
   and rocket panels. Due to the large size of the components, this process
   is generally performed by moving the parts through a peening enclosure
   or by moving peening equipment following a trajectory on the parts.
   Previous research on peen forming simulation has rarely considered the
   influence of the peening pattern on the resulting deformed shape. The
   purpose of this work was therefore to evaluate experimentally and
   numerically this effect using small scale tests. A simple model was
   proposed to simulate incremental deflections as the shot stream traveled
   over the samples. Model parameters were calibrated experimentally and
   then applied to a different geometry for validation. Finite element
   analyses correctly predicted the complex radius distribution arising
   from the peening path and the constraints applied to the sample during
   peening. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We report the improvement of the operational stability of dye-sensitized

   DSSCs were prepared by adding various concentrations of MWCNTs (up to
   1.0\% wt.) to TiO2 anatase nanoparticles. Optimization of MWCNT
   concentration leads to photoconversion efficiency as high as 4.1\% as
   opposed to 3.7\% for pure TiO2 photoanodes. The performance of the solar
   cells was measured for 10 consecutive days of continuous ambient light
   exposure. MWCNT addition results in the decrease of efficiency from
   4.1\% to 3.7\%, while a decrease from 3.7\% to 2.4\% was recorded in
   pure TiO2 photoanodes. These results are encouraging toward the
   commercial exploitation of DSSCs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{97}},
Pages = {{354-365}},
Month = {{JUN 28}},
Abstract = {{Known limitations of tumbling blenders (weak diffusive axial mixing and
   segregation of free flowing granules) have provided the motivation to
   investigate the flow and mixing of granules inside a tetrapodal blender.
   This blender can be thought of as two V-shaped pairs of arms connected
   and twisted at their bottom ends. In this work, more than 100
   experiments were carried out under a wide set of operating conditions
   and geometrical configurations. Compared to the conventional V-blender,
   this geometry is shown to provide shorter mixing times and better axial
   and radial mixing efficiency, especially when its upper or lower
   V-shaped part is twisted by 45 with respect to the rotation axis.
   Segregation of granules with different sizes and densities was
   investigated for varying rotational speeds (5-30 RPM) and fill levels
   (35-65\%V). It is observed that the segregation intensity is far less
   important in the tetrapodal blender than in the V-blender, and that it
   decreases significantly with an increase in rotational speed, the effect
   of the fill level being insignificant. It is also shown that kinetic
   sieving is the main governing mechanism for the segregation of granules.
   Finally, a criterion is proposed for the scale-up of the tetrapodal
   blender and the V-blender so that they may operate efficiently, without
   pronounced segregation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Design and validation of an intelligent wheelchair towards a
   clinically-functional outcome}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION}},

Abstract = {{Background: Many people with mobility impairments, who require the use
   of powered wheelchairs, have difficulty completing basic maneuvering
   tasks during their activities of daily living (ADL). In order to provide
   assistance to this population, robotic and intelligent system
   technologies have been used to design an intelligent powered wheelchair
   (IPW). This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the design and
   validation of the IPW.
   Methods: The main contributions of this work are three-fold. First, we
   present a software architecture for robot navigation and control in
   constrained spaces. Second, we describe a decision-theoretic approach
   for achieving robust speech-based control of the intelligent wheelchair.
   Third, we present an evaluation protocol motivated by a meaningful
   clinical outcome, in the form of the Robotic Wheelchair Skills Test
   (RWST). This allows us to perform a thorough characterization of the
   performance and safety of the system, involving 17 test subjects (8
   non-PW users, 9 regular PW users), 32 complete RWST sessions, 25 total
   hours of testing, and 9 kilometers of total running distance.
   Results: User tests with the RWST show that the navigation architecture
   reduced collisions by more than 60\% compared to other recent
   intelligent wheelchair platforms. On the tasks of the RWST, we measured
   an average decrease of 4\% in performance score and 3\% in safety score
   (not statistically significant), compared to the scores obtained with
   conventional driving model. This analysis was performed with regular
   users that had over 6 years of wheelchair driving experience, compared
   to approximately one half-hour of training with the autonomous mode.
   Conclusions: The platform tested in these experiments is among the most
   experimentally validated robotic wheelchairs in realistic contexts. The
   results establish that proficient powered wheelchair users can achieve
   the same level of performance with the intelligent command mode, as with
   the conventional command mode.}},

Abstract = {{To obtain potentially applicable microorganisms to an effective in situ
   microbial enhanced oil recovery operation, bacteria that were compatible
   with the harsh conditions of a petroleum reservoir were isolated from a
   crude oil sample. The application of an oil spreading technique showed
   that all of the isolates were capable of producing biosurfactants from
   both the glucose and crude oil as carbon sources. The secreted
   biosurfactants could at least reduce the surface tension 20 mN/m and for
   one of the isolates; the surface tension value dropped below 40 mN/m. In
   addition, the contact angle measurements revealed that the produced
   biosurfactants could effectively alter the wettability of the oil
   saturated rock samples. At last, the effect of isolates and their
   biosurfactants on improving oil production from oil saturated rock
   samples was investigated. It was observed that the presence of bacteria
   in the system could increase the amount of produced oil in comparison
   with the case where cell free biosurfactants were utilized.}},

Abstract = {{Maintaining wakefulness is associated with a progressive increase in the
   need for sleep. This phenomenon has been linked to changes in synaptic
   function. The synaptic adhesion molecule Neuroligin-1 (NLG1) controls
   the activity and synaptic localization of N-methyl-D-aspartate
   receptors, which activity is impaired by prolonged wakefulness. We here
   highlight that this pathway may underlie both the adverse effects of
   sleep loss on cognition and the subsequent changes in cortical
   synchrony. We found that the expression of specific Nlg1 transcript
   variants is changed by sleep deprivation in three mouse strains. These
   observations were associated with strain-specific changes in synaptic
   NLG1 protein content. Importantly, we showed that Nlg1 knockout mice are
   not able to sustain wakefulness and spend more time in nonrapid eye
   movement sleep than wild-type mice. These changes occurred with
   modifications in waking quality as exemplified by low theta/alpha
   activity during wakefulness and poor preference for social novelty, as
   well as altered delta synchrony during sleep. Finally, we identified a
   transcriptional pathway that could underlie the sleep/wake-dependent
   changes in Nlg1 expression and that involves clock transcription
   factors. We thus suggest that NLG1 is an element that contributes to the
   coupling of neuronal activity to sleep/wake regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) is a promising polymer for the production
   of bio-based and biodegradable materials. This study focuses on the
   development of novel tunable morphological states based on ternary
   blends comprising PBS. The other biodegradable polymers are selected
   from a set of poly(lactic acid) (PLA), poly(butylene
   adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT), and polycaprolactone(PCL). Three
   completely different morphological states are observed here for the
   ternary blends and are reported for the first time including: partial
   wetting for PBS/PLA/PCL in which PLA droplets self-assemble at the
   interface of PBS and PCL; complete wetting tri-continuous morphology for
   PBS/PLA/PBAT; and a highly unusual state combining both partial and
   complete wetting cases for the PBS/PBAT/PCL blend. The dramatic
   variation of morphology for these blends is possible due to very low
   interfacial tensions between the polymer pairs. Within these
   morphological wetting states a significant variety of specific
   structures can be obtained through control of the relative compositions.
   For example, for the partially wet xPBS/yPLA/50\%PCL blend, changing the
   volume fraction of PBS to PIA from (phi PBS/phi PLA = 10 to (phi pgs/phi
   pLA = 0.1 results in a transformation from PLA droplets at the PBS/PCL
   interface to PBS droplets at the PLA/PCL interface. From the
   thermodynamic standpoint, the observed partial and complete wetting
   cases are supported by Harkins theory. This work opens the door to a
   wide range of novel and stable PBS-based ternary blend structures
   comprising biodegradable polymers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Microalgae are microscopic plants that exist in an aquatic environment.
   They are involved in the production of high value compounds and also
   have applications in energy production. In this work, the regulation of
   biomass concenteration in a bioreactor is investigated by using an
   observer-based backstepping control approach. The process is controlled
   to operate in a constant biomass concentration mode, in order to
   maintain the culture at a desired concentration and to sustain high
   biomass productioin levels. Combined with the backstepping controller, a
   nonlinear Lipschitz observer is proposed. On the basis of the Droop
   model, which describes the dynamic behavior of the microalgae process
   and based on the biomass measurements, the stability of the state error
   dynamics can be guarnateed. Finally, simulations and comparisons with a
   PI controller are developed to show the performance of the nonlinear
   observer-based controller in set point tracking and load rejection in
   the presence of parameter uncertainties.}},

Abstract = {{Toys and children's jewelry may contain metals to which children can be

   total concentrations (TC's) of As, Ba, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb, and
   Se in toys and jewelry (n = 72) bought on the North American market and
   compare TC's to regulatory limits, and (2) to estimate oral metal
   bioavailability in selected items (n = 4) via bioaccessibility testing.
   For metallic toys and children's jewelry (n = 24) 20 items had TC's
   exceeding migratable concentration limits (European Union). Seven of
   seventeen jewelry items did not comply with TC limits in U.S. and
   Canadian regulations. Samples included articles with very high Cd (37\%
   {[}w/w]), Pb (65\%), and Cu (71\%) concentrations. For plastic toys (n =
   18), toys with paint or coating (n = 12), and brittle or pliable toys (n
   = 18), TC's were below the EU migration limits (except in one toy for
   each category). Bioaccessibility tests showed that a tested jewelry item
   strongly leached Pb (gastric: 698 mu g, intestinal: 705 mu g) and some
   Cd (1.38 and 1.42 mu g). Especially in metallic toys and jewelry,

Abstract = {{Momentum variation in two-phase flow generates significant low frequency
   forces, capable of producing unwanted and destructive vibrations in
   nuclear or petroleum industries. Two-phase flow-induced forces in piping
   were previously studied over a range of diameters from 6 mm to 70 mm in
   different piping element geometries, such as elbows, U-bends, and tees.
   Dimensionless models were then developed to estimate the rms forces and
   generate vibration excitation force spectra. It was found that slug flow
   generates the largest forces due to the large momentum variation between
   Taylor bubbles and slugs. The present study was conducted with a 52 mm
   diameter U-bend tube carrying a vertical upward flow. Two-phase
   flow-induced forces were measured. In addition, two-phase flow
   parameters, such as the local void fraction, bubble size and velocity,
   and slug frequency were studied to understand the relationship between
   the force spectra and the two-phase flow patterns. A new two-phase flow
   pattern map, based on existing transition models and validated using our
   own local void fraction measurements and force spectra, is proposed.
   This paper also presents a comparison of the present dimensionless
   forces with those of previous studies, thus covers a wide range of
   geometries and Weber numbers. Finally, a dimensionless spectrum is
   proposed to correlate forces with large momentum variations observed for
   certain flow patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Having previously verified the quasi-steady model under two-phase flow
   laboratory conditions, the present work investigates the feasibility of
   practical application of the model to a prototypical steam generator
   (SG) tube subjected to a nonuniform two-phase flow. The SG tube
   vibration response and normal work-rate induced by tube-support
   interaction are computed for a range of flow conditions. Similar
   computations are performed using the Connors model as a reference case.
   In the quasi-steady model, the fluid forces are expressed in terms of
   the quasi-static drag and lift force coefficients and their derivatives.
   These forces have been measured in two-phase flow over a wide range of
   void fractions making it possible to model the effect of void fraction
   variation along the tube span. A full steam generator tube subjected to
   a nonuniform two-phase flow was considered in the simulations. The
   nonuniform flow distribution corresponds to that along a prototypical
   steam-generator tube based on thermal-hydraulic computations.
   Computation results show significant and important differences between
   the Connors model and the two-phase flow based quasi-steady model. While
   both models predict the occurrence of fluidelastic instability, the
   predicted pre-instability and post instability behavior is very
   different in the two models. The Connors model underestimates the
   flow-induced negative damping in the pre-instability regime and vastly
   overestimates it in the post instability velocity range. As a result the
   Connors model is found to underestimate the work-rate used in the
   fretting wear assessment at normal operating velocities, rendering the
   model potentially nonconservative under these practically important
   conditions. Above the critical velocity, this model largely
   overestimates the work-rate. The quasi-steady model on the other hand
   predicts a more moderately increasing work-rate with the flow velocity.
   The work-rates predicted by the model are found to be within the range
   of experimental results, giving further confidence to the predictive
   ability of the model. Finally, the two-phase flow based quasi-steady
   model shows that fluidelastic forces may reduce the effective tube
   damping in the pre-instability regime, leading to higher than expected
   work-rates at prototypical operating velocities.}},

Abstract = {{Eslami and Talebi (2011) {[}25] proposed an untraceable electronic cash

   illustrating Eslami and Talebi's scheme, as one of the latest
   untraceable electronic cash schemes, and showing its weaknesses (in
   fulfilling the properties of perceptibility of double spender,
   unforgeability and date attainability of coins) and its faults (related
   to exchange protocol), we propose a new untraceable electronic cash
   scheme which is immune to the weaknesses of the former. Our scheme
   contains anonymity, double-spending detection, unforgeability and date
   attachability properties and prevents forging. To do this, we described
   a special construction which injects the expiration date and the
   identity of the customer onto the coin and detects the identity in the
   case of double spending. Lastly, we show that the efficiency of our
   scheme is comparable with other schemes. (C) 2013 Sharif University of

Abstract = {{We are reporting the results of density functional calculations of the

   contact is more characteristic of a physisorbed state, the adsorption of
   Pd and Ti involves much stronger state mixing as in chemisorption.
   Metal-induced gap states, which can potentially short-circuit the
   device, are clearly revealed for the first time, allowing us to evaluate
   their penetration length. The evanescence of MIGS is primarily governed
   by the band gap of the nanoribbon, and we can estimate an acceptable
   minimal length for an effective transport channel to a few nanometers.
   Different impacts of the presence of metal-induced gap states on the
   properties of graphene nanoribbons are discussed in terms of charge

   Parameters of thermodynamic models have been optimized to reproduce all

Abstract = {{Davis and Cavanagh (1993) have proposed a solution to avoid the footstep

   develop a method that decomposes left and right GRF profiles from the
   GRF profile recorded on a single platform. This method aims to include a
   systematic detection of the single to double stand-phase-instants in
   order to lead to accurate measurement of the vertical GRF component in
   typically developing children. Methods: Six children were asked to walk
   without targeting their footsteps on a set-up composed of independent
   force platforms. The vertical GRF component, independently measured on
   the different platforms, was numerically summed to obtain the
   corresponding global vertical GRF, to which the decomposition method was
   applied. Then, the validation consisted in comparing the vertical GRF
   computed from this decomposition to the independently measured vertical
   GRF. Results: the mean relative error between the computed vertical GRF
   and the corresponding measured vertical GRF of 36 double stances (6
   double stances x 6 children) is equal to 3.8+/-2.6 \%. Conclusion:
   implemented a new method to assess with known accuracy the vertical GRF

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Rapid demographic aging in countries around the world has prompted an
   interest in understanding the mobility patterns of seniors. While much
   research has been conducted in terms of motorized modes, the promotion
   of healthy aging argues for new research to investigate the multi-modal
   travel behavior of seniors including active travel. The objective of
   this paper is to investigate the factors that influence the use of two
   motorized and one active mode of transportation, and their corresponding
   trip length. A joint discrete-continuous modeling framework allows us to
   examine the tendency to travel by different modes using a multinomial
   structure, and trip length using a hazard formulation. Data are drawn
   from Montreal's Household Travel Survey of 2008. A broad array of
   covariates related to individual and household attributes and urban form
   are used. The results of the analysis reveal a significant degree of
   geographical variability in the travel behavior of seniors in Montreal.
   In particular, estimates for seniors with different socio-economic and
   demographic profiles show substantial intra-urban variability in walking
   behavior, and the role of neighborhood design attributes in influencing
   the mobility of seniors. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background. - Given the undesired metabolic side effects of atypical
   antipsychotic medication it is important to understand the neuronal
   basis related to processing of appetite regulation in patients affected
   by schizophrenia.
   Methods. - Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
   assess brain activity in response to food cues and neutral stimuli in
   twenty patients with schizophrenia and eleven healthy individuals. In
   addition to clinical and dietary habits assessments, we collected, in
   patients, measurements of fasting glucose, ghrelin, leptin, insulin,
   prolactin and lipids blood concentration and we correlated the cerebral
   activity with clinical and metabolic measures.
   Results. - Both groups engaged a common neuronal network while
   processing food cues, which included the left insula, primary
   sensorimotor areas, and inferior temporal and parietal cortices.
   Cerebral responses to appetitive stimuli in thalamus, parahippocampus
   and middle frontal gyri were specific only to schizophrenic patients,
   with parahippocampal activity related to hunger state and increasing
   linearly over time. Antipsychotic medication dosage correlated
   positively with a cognitive measure reflecting food cravings, whereas
   the severity of the disease correlated negatively with a cognitive
   measure indicating dietary restraint in eating habits. These cognitive
   variables correlated, in turn, with parahippocampal and thalamic
   neuronal activities, respectively.
   Conclusions. - We identified a specific neural substrate underlying
   cognitive processing of appetitive stimuli in schizophrenia, which may
   contribute to appetite dysfunction via perturbations in processing of
   homeostatic signals in relation to external stimuli. Our results also
   suggest that both antipsychotic medication and the disease severity per
   se could amplify these effects, via different mechanisms and neuronal
   networks. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed propulsion in aircraft brings many advantages in terms of
   efficiency and noise reduction. While the distribution can be done
   mechanically through the use of gears and transmissions, electrical
   propulsion allows for lower maintenance needs, higher efficiency, and
   lower emissions through the complete decoupling of the gas turbines and
   the propulsion fans. Such systems have been investigated in the past and
   NASA is executing on a development plan to bring turbo-electric
   propulsion systems for transportation aircraft by 2035. The very high
   specific power required for the airborne generators and motors can only
   be achieved by using superconductors. Analytical 2-D sizing models have
   been created and showed very promising results. NASA is now funding the
   development of higher fidelity models for superconducting machines in
   which an actual 3-D representation of the geometry is considered. The
   magnetic flux distribution is calculated using Biot-Savart's law coupled
   with the magnetic moment method for the backiron. The code also includes
   thermal and mechanical models allowing for a full and accurate design.
   The paper describes the model architecture and the methods used to
   perform high-temperature superconducting machine sizing and
   optimization.}},

Abstract = {{The software engineering literature reports empirical evidence on the
   relation between various characteristics of a software system and its
   quality. Among other factors, recent studies have shown that a proper
   choice of identifiers influences understandability and maintainability.
   Indeed, identifiers are developers' main source of information and guide
   their cognitive processes during program comprehension when high-level
   documentation is scarce or outdated and when source code is not
   sufficiently commented. This paper proposes a novel approach to
   recognize words composing source code identifiers. The approach is based
   on an adaptation of Dynamic Time Warping used to recognize words in
   continuous speech. The approach overcomes the limitations of existing
   identifier-splitting approaches when naming conventions (e.g., Camel
   Case) are not used or when identifiers contain abbreviations. We apply
   the approach on a sample of more than 1000 identifiers extracted from
   340 C programs and compare its results with a simple Camel Case splitter
   and with an implementation of an alternative identifier splitting
   approach, Samurai. Results indicate the capability of the novel
   approach: (i) to outperform the alternative ones, when using a
   dictionary augmented with domain knowledge or a contextual dictionary
   and (ii) to expand 48\% of a set of selected abbreviations into
   dictionary words. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Chimeric growth factors may represent a powerful alternative to their
   natural counterparts for the functionalization of tissue-engineered
   scaffolds and applications in regenerative medicine. Their rational
   design should provide a simple, readily scalable production strategy
   while improving retention at the site of action. In that endeavor, we
   here report the synthesis of a chimeric protein corresponding to human
   vascular endothelial growth factor 165 being N-terminally fused to an E5
   peptide tag (E5-VEGF). E5-VEGF was successfully expressed as a homodimer
   in mammalian cells. Following affinity purification, in vitro surface
   plasmon resonance biosensing and cell survival assays confirmed
   diffusible E5-VEGF ability to bind to its receptor ectodomains, while
   observed morphological phenotypes confirmed its anti-apoptotic features.
   Additional surface plasmon resonance assays highlighted that E5-VEGF
   could be specifically captured with high stability when interacting with
   covalently immobilized K5 peptide (a synthetic peptide designed to bind
   to the E5 moiety of chimeric hVEGF). This immobilization strategy was
   applied to glass substrates and chimeric hVEGF was shown to be
   maintained in a functionally active state following capture. Altogether,
   our data demonstrated that stable hVEGF capture can be performed via
   coiled-coil interactions without impacting hVEGF bioactivity, thus
   opening up the way to future applications in the field of tissue
   engineering and regenerative medicine. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{Far-field drag-prediction and decomposition methods are powerful tools

   designed for three-dimensional viscous, subsonic, and transonic flows,
   is defined for both inertial and noninertial coordinate systems and
   allows drag decomposition to be performed on either static or

Abstract = {{Purpose. - Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is a powerful analytical
   tool that allows the study of interactions between commonly used
   biomaterials and the human body. In conventional SEM (HiVac), hydrated
   biological samples cannot be analyzed in their natural state and must be
   dried and metallized. The primary goal of this study is to present
   recent developments in SEM, notably Environmental SEM (ESEM). The
   secondary objective is to define the potential utility of these new
   technologies in the study of periprosthetic breast capsules.
   Materials and methods. - Our pilot study group prospectively included 10
   patients with breast cancer undergoing 2-stage expander to implant
   reconstruction. Periprosthetic breast capsule specimens were sampled
   during expander removal. Each sample was analyzed using both HiVac and
   ESEM modalities. Energy dispersive X-ray ({[}DX) studies were also
   conducted in order to assess the chemical composition of the capsular
   tissue samples. Under each observation mode, comparisons of samples'
   three-dimensional surface relief, cellular composition and biofilm
   presence were made. For each image, a score from 1-3 on a Likert scale
   was attributed by three independent experts in electron microscopy.
   Results. - HiVac mode was found to be superior to ESEM for the
   assessment of the three main study parameters (surface relief,
   cellularity, biofilm). The quality of the {[}DX analysis was equivalent
   under both SEM modalities.
   Conclusion. - HiVac mode was shown to be more appropriate than ESEM for
   the global analysis of periprosthetic breast capsules. EDX analysis
   permits the identification of atypical chemical elements in tissue
   samples. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

   such as polyethylenimine (PEI), are known to be efficient at delivering
   nucleic acids by overcoming lysosomal sequestration possibly through the
   proton sponge effect, although other mechanisms such as membrane
   disruption arising from an interaction between the polycation and the
   endosome/lysosome membrane, have been proposed. Chitosan is an efficient
   delivery vehicle for nucleic acids, yet its buffering capacity has been
   thought to be significantly lower than that of PEI, suggesting that the
   molecular mechanism responsible for endolysosomal escape was not proton
   sponge based. However, previous comparisons of PEI and chitosan
   buffering capacity were performed on a mass concentration basis instead
   of a charge concentration basis, the latter being the most relevant
   comparison basis because polycation-DNA complexes form at ratios of
   charge groups (amine to phosphate), rather than according to mass. We
   hypothesized that chitosan has a high buffering capacity when compared
   to PEI on a molar basis and could therefore possibly mediate
   endolysosomal release through the proton sponge effect. In this study,
   we examined the ionization behavior of chitosan and chitosan-DNA
   complexes and compared to that of PEI and polylysine on a charge
   concentration basis. A mean field theory based on the use of the
   Poisson-Boltzmann equation and an Ising model were also applied to model
   ionization behavior of chitosan and PEI, respectively. We found that
   chitosan has a higher buffering capacity than PEI in the endolysosomal
   pH range, while the formation of chitosan-DNA complexes reduces chitosan
   buffering capacity because of the negative electrostatic environment of
   nucleic acids that facilitates chitosan ionization. These data suggest
   that chitosans have a similar capacity as PEI to mediate endosomal
   escape through the proton sponge effect, possibly in a manner which
   depends on the presence of excess chitosan.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Cartilage repair elicited by bone marrow stimulation can be
   enhanced by a chitosan-glycerol phosphate (GP)/blood implant, through
   mechanisms involving therapeutic inflammatory angiogenesis. The implant
   is formed by in situ coagulation, which can be accelerated by adding
   coagulation factors. We hypothesized that coagulation factors enhance
   acute subchondral angiogenesis in repairing drilled defects.
   Design: Full-thickness cartilage defects were created bilaterally in 12
   skeletally mature rabbit knee trochlea, microdrilled, then allowed to
   bleed as a control (N = 6) or treated with chitosan-GP/blood implant (N
   = 6), or implant solidified with thrombin (IIa), tissue factor (TF) with
   recombinant human factor Vila (rhFVIIa), or rhFVIIa alone (N = 4 each
   condition). At 3 weeks post-operative, quantitative stereology was used
   to obtain blood vessel length (L-V), surface (S-V), and volume (V-V)
   density at systematic depths in two microdrill holes per defect.
   Collagen type I, type II and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) percent stain in
   non-mineralized repair tissue were analysed by histomorphometry.
   Results: All drill holes were healing, and showed a depth-dependent
   increase in granulation tissue blood vessel density (Lv, Sv, and Vv, P <
   0.005). Residual chitosan implant locally suppressed blood vessel
   ingrowth into the granulation tissue, whereas holes completely cleared
   of chitosan amplified angiogenesis vs microdrill-only (P = 0.049), an
   effect enhanced by IIa. Chitosan implant suppressed strong Col-I,
   Col-II, and GAG accumulation that occurred spontaneously in drill-only
   bone defects (P < 0.005) and coagulation factors did not alter this
   effect.
   Conclusions: Subchondral angiogenesis is promoted by chitosan implant
   clearance. Chitosan implant treatment suppresses fibrocartilage scar
   tissue formation, and promotes bone remodeling, which allows more blood
   vessel migration and woven bone repair towards the cartilage lesion
   area. (C) 2013 Osteoarthritis Research Society International. Published

Abstract = {{Defect prediction models are a well-known technique for identifying
   defect-prone files or packages such that practitioners can allocate
   their quality assurance efforts (e. g., testing and code reviews).
   However, once the critical files or packages have been identified,
   developers still need to spend considerable time drilling down to the
   functions or even code snippets that should be reviewed or tested. This
   makes the approach too time consuming and impractical for large software
   systems. Instead, we consider defect prediction models that focus on
   identifying defect-prone ({''}risky{''}) software changes instead of
   files or packages. We refer to this type of quality assurance activity
   as ``Just-In-Time Quality Assurance,{''} because developers can review
   and test these risky changes while they are still fresh in their minds
   (i.e., at check-in time). To build a change risk model, we use a wide
   range of factors based on the characteristics of a software change, such
   as the number of added lines, and developer experience. A large-scale
   study of six open source and five commercial projects from multiple
   domains shows that our models can predict whether or not a change will
   lead to a defect with an average accuracy of 68 percent and an average
   recall of 64 percent. Furthermore, when considering the effort needed to
   review changes, we find that using only 20 percent of the effort it
   would take to inspect all changes, we can identify 35 percent of all
   defect-inducing changes. Our findings indicate that ``Just-In-Time
   Quality Assurance{''} may provide an effort-reducing way to focus on the
   most risky changes and thus reduce the costs of developing high-quality
   software.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports an analytical and numerical study of natural
   convection in a shallow enclosure filled with a non-Newtonian fluid.
   Thermal boundary conditions of the Neumann type are applied on the
   horizontal walls of the enclosure while the vertical walls are assumed
   adiabatic. A power law model is used to characterize the non-Newtonian
   fluid behavior of the fluid. The governing parameters for the problem
   are the thermal Rayleigh number Re, power-law index n, Prandtl number Pr
   and cavity aspect ratio A. An analytical solution, valid for an infinite
   layer, is derived on the basis of the parallel flow approximation.
   Rigid-rigid, free-free and rigid-free hydrodynamic boundary conditions
   are considered. It is demonstrated that, for shear-thinning fluids, the
   onset of convection is subcritical. For shear thickening fluids,
   convection is found to occur at a supercritical Rayleigh number equal to
   zero. The effects of the non-Newtonian behavior on the fluid flow,
   temperature field and heat transfer are discussed, A good agreement is
   found between the analytical predictions and the numerical results
   obtained by solving the full governing equations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Digital Image Correlation algorithms capable of determining continuous
   displacement fields are receiving growing attention in the field of
   mechanical properties identification. In this paper, we develop an
   Improved Spectral Approach (ISA) to reconstruct continuous displacements
   based on their Fourier decomposition. This approach leads to a time and
   memory-efficient algorithm, thanks to the fast Fourier transform.
   Moreover, the Fourier-based decomposition enables accurate heterogeneous
   measurements. Improvements consist in increasing the accuracy and
   convergence rate as well as dealing with non-periodic displacements and
   images. Furthermore, a theoretical framework is presented to quantify
   the noise sensitivity of the ISA from which useful information is
   retrieved. The approach is evaluated using synthetic images deformed by
   heterogeneous displacement fields. Comparisons show that the introduced
   modifications lead to lower uncertainties by one order of magnitude in
   the case of non-periodic images and displacement field studied.
   Moreover, first-order (SO1) and second-order (SO2) subset-based Digital
   Image Correlation algorithms are compared with the ISA. The comparisons
   herein reveal that the uncertainties of the ISA are 6-9 times smaller
   than those of the SO1 due to insufficiency of the first-order shape
   function for the estimation of heterogeneous displacements, while being
   slightly smaller than those of the SO2. Moreover, as the image
   smoothness decreases, the uncertainties of the SO2 deviate from those of
   the ISA and the exact displacements. The presented approach shows great
   potentials for challenging applications such as strain measurements at

Abstract = {{The mechanisms of segregation in solids mixing, even in simple rotating
   drums, are not clearly understood. Although most past studies have
   focused on binary mixtures, this work investigates the effect of
   polydispersity on granular flow, mixing, and segregation in a rotating
   drum operated in rolling regime through particle trajectories obtained
   from the radioactive particle tracking technique. Velocity profiles,
   radial segregation, and axial dispersion coefficients for monodisperse
   and polydisperse systems of glass beads are analyzed with respect to
   rotational speed and particle size. A model is introduced to predict the
   residence times along streamlines and evaluate the rate at which the
   material renews at the free surface and within the inner layers of the
   bed. Our results reveal similar velocity profiles and residence times
   for monodisperse and polydisperse systems. They also indicate that the
   particles distribute along the radial direction of the drum, although
   not necessarily in a core/shell configuration. (c) 2012 American

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new formulation to investigate the effects of
   floating ice blocks on seismically-excited rectangular water-containing
   structures. The proposed method is based on a sub-structuring approach,
   where the flexible containing structure and ice-added mass are modeled
   using finite elements, while hydrodynamic effects are modeled
   analytically through interaction forces at the water-structure and
   water-ice interfaces, thus eliminating the need for reservoir finite
   element discretization. In addition to accounting for the influence of
   floating ice blocks and container walls' flexibility, the developed
   frequency- and time-domain techniques also include the effects of
   container geometrical or material asymmetry as well as the coupling
   between convective and impulsive components of hydrodynamic pressure.
   The proposed formulation is illustrated through a numerical example
   illustrating the dynamic response of symmetric and asymmetric
   water-containing structures covered with floating ice blocks. Obtained
   time- and frequency-domain responses are successfully validated against
   advanced finite element analyses including fluid-structure interaction
   capabilities. For the water-containing structures studied, the results
   show that the presence of floating ice blocks affects the frequency
   content and amplitudes of the dynamic responses corresponding to
   convective and impulsive modes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this article is to experimentally study the damping of
   composite sandwich beams with lightweight honeycomb core. The top and
   bottom facesheets are made of carbon/epoxy layers with partial
   interleaved viscoelastic layers. A new damping approach consisting of
   selectively targeting the inflection points of the bending mode shapes
   is proposed. At the nodes, the shearing deformation in the beam is
   maximal, and so is the strain in the viscoelastic layers. The
   experimental investigation of damping is made by means of standard
   impact tests using an instrumented hammer performed on beam specimens.
   The nodes are determined experimentally by moving a small accelerometer
   along the beam axis and by measuring the amplitude of the acceleration
   at each point. This novel damping approach keeps the damping ratio as
   high as the ratio obtained with standard (full coverage) surface damping
   treatment while reducing the added mass by almost 50\%. A comparison of
   the results obtained in this study with experimental and numerical
   results found in the literature leads to the conclusion that the most
   efficient way of damping this type of sandwich structure is to modify
   and/or improve the viscoelastic properties of the core.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider a multi-depot periodic vehicle routing
   problem which is characterized by the presence of a homogeneous fleet of
   vehicles, multiple depots, multiple periods, and two types of
   constraints that are often found in reality, i.e., vehicle capacity and
   route duration constraints. The objective is to minimize total travel
   costs. To tackle the problem, we propose an efficient path relinking
   algorithm whose exploration and exploitation strategies enable the
   algorithm to address the problem in two different settings: (1) As a
   stand-alone algorithm, and (2) As a part of a co-operative search
   algorithm called integrative co-operative search. The performance of the
   proposed path relinking algorithm is evaluated, in each of the above
   ways, based on standard benchmark instances. The computational results
   show that the developed PRA performs well, in both solution quality and
   computational efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Controlled rocking steel frames have been proposed as an efficient way
   to avoid the structural damage and residual deformations that are
   expected in conventional seismic force resisting systems. Although the
   base rocking response is intended to limit the force demands, higher
   mode effects can amplify member design forces, reducing the viability of
   the system. This paper suggests that seismic forces may be limited more
   effectively by providing multiple force-limiting mechanisms. Two
   techniques are proposed: detailing one or more rocking joints above the
   base rocking joint and providing a self-centring energy dissipative
   (SCED) brace at one or more levels. These concepts are applied to the
   design of an eight-storey prototype structure and a shake table model at
   30\% scale. A simple numerical model that was used as a design tool is
   in good agreement with frequency characterization and low-amplitude
   seismic tests of the shake table model, particularly when multiple
   force-limiting mechanisms are active. These results suggest that the
   proposed mechanisms can enable better capacity design by reducing the
   variability of peak seismic force demands without causing excessive
   displacements. Similar results are expected for other systems that rely
   on a single location of concentrated nonlinearity to limit peak seismic
   loads. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of 56 large-amplitude shake table tests
   of a 30\% scale eight-storey controlled rocking steel frame. No
   significant damage or residual deformations were observed after any of
   the tests. The frame had four possible configurations on the basis of
   combinations of two higher mode mitigation mechanisms. The first
   mitigation mechanism was formed by allowing the upper section of the
   frame to rock, so as to better control the mid-height overturning
   moment. The second mitigation mechanism was formed by replacing the
   conventional first-storey brace with a self-centering energy dissipative
   (SCED) brace, so as to better control the base shear. The mechanisms had
   little effect during records where higher mode effects were not
   apparent, but they substantially reduced the shear and overturning
   moment envelopes, as well as the peak floor accelerations, during more
   demanding records. The reduction in storey shears led to similarly
   reduced brace force demands. Although the peak force demands in the
   columns were not reduced by as much as the frame overturning moments,
   using an upper rocking joint allowed the column demands to be estimated
   without the need to assume a lateral force distribution. The tests
   demonstrated that multiple force-limiting mechanisms can be used to
   provide better control of peak seismic forces without excessive
   increases in drift demands, thus enabling more reliable capacity design.
   These results are expected to be widely applicable to structures where
   the peak seismic forces are significantly influenced by higher mode
   effects. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Pre-ozonation of cyanobacterial (CB) cells in raw water and

   species after exposure (CT) to ozone of <0.2 mg min L-1, although no
   significant decrease in total cell numbers was observed. Maximum
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) releases of 0.96 mg L-1 and 1.63 mg L-1
   were measured after zonation of 250,000 cells mL(-1) of M. aeruginosa
   and A. flos-aquae, respectively. DOC release was found to be pH and
   ozone dose dependent. Ozonation of CB cells increased formation of
   trihalomethanes (THM) and haloacetic acids (HAA), mainly for suspensions
   of A. flos-aquae at pH 8 (by 174\% and 65\% for THM and HAA
   respectively). Utilities considering using ozone for oxidising CB cells
   should weigh out the benefit of CB control with the potential increased
   formation of chlorinated DBPs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   performance of several M-ary modulations, and the average SNR gains
   obtained from AF opportunistic relaying. Asymptotic analyses for the BER
   and achievable diversity order of the system are also presented. Using

Journal = {{ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{1-6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we are presenting the method of computation of three
   dimensional (3D) neutron fluxes in one pin hexagonal cell. Carlvik's
   collision probability method of solving neutron transport equation for
   computing fluxes has been used here. This method can consider exact
   geometrical details of the given geometry. While using this method,
   track length computations are required to be done. We have described
   here the method of computing tracks in one 3D hexagon. A program HX7 has
   been developed for this purpose. This program has been implemented in
   the NXT module of the code DRAGON, where tracks in the pins are
   computed.
   For computing tracks in 3D, first we use the tracks computed in the two
   dimensions (2D) and then we project them in the third dimension. We have
   developed equations for this purpose. In both the regions, fuel pin as
   well as in the moderator surrounding the pin the fluxes are assumed to
   be uniform. A uniform source is assumed in the moderator region.
   Reflecting boundary conditions are applied on all the sides as well as
   on the top and bottom surfaces. One group 2D and 3D fluxes are compared
   with the respective results obtained by the EXCELT module of DRAGON. To
   check the computations, tracks are plotted and errors in the
   computations are obtained. It is observed by using both the modules
   EXCELT and NXT that the fluxes in the pins converge faster and in the
   moderator region fluxes converge very slowly. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Influence of local heterogeneity on Doorstopper stress measurements}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND MINING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{288-300}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{When using so-called overcoring techniques to estimate stresses in rock
   masses for site investigation or in concrete structures for monitoring
   purposes, stresses are derived from recovered strains using elastic
   stress-strain relationships for which the media is assumed to be
   homogeneous at all the scales involved in the measurement. As we know,
   rock, rock masses and concrete are not homogeneous and this will affect
   the accuracy of stress measurements. By simulating stress measurements
   with the modified Doorstopper technique which can be applied to a
   variety of conditions including measurements in concrete structures, it
   is shown how heterogeneities found at the measurement scale can be
   accounted for and how the estimated stresses are influenced by
   heterogeneities found at different scales. Using a numerical model, a
   two phase heterogeneous medium resembling concrete is modelled and the
   complete modified Doorstopper stress measurement operations, including
   stress relief drilling and recovered core reloading are simulated. The
   RPR method allowing calculating four far-field stress components from a
   single measurement had been developed for a homogeneous medium and is
   tested here for its effectiveness in heterogeneous materials. The
   results show the error on the estimated stresses is little affected by
   the scale at which the deformability parameters are determined and the
   main source of error is linked to the estimation of the stress component
   parallel to the borehole axis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{On the effect of the orientation of sheet rolling direction in shot peen
   forming}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{213}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{926-938}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Peen forming is commonly used in the aerospace industry to shape large
   and thin panels, such as wing skins. This manufacturing process uses
   shot peening to introduce unbalanced compressive stresses near the
   surface of the component. These stresses tend to bend the panel and,
   when optimized, lead to the desired contour. Sheet materials often
   exhibit both elastic and plastic anisotropy, which can alter the
   development of curvatures. Since peen forming relies on compressive
   stresses to upset equilibrium, resulting curvatures may also be affected
   by initial stresses in the part. In this work, the influence of the
   rolling direction orientation with respect to the sample was
   investigated experimentally and numerically for the first time for
   aluminium alloy 2024-T3 specimens. Although maximum deflections were
   only slightly dependent on the rolling direction orientation, it was
   found that radii of curvature varied by as much as 10\% with respect to
   this parameter. Finite element simulations allowed quantification of the
   individual effects of non-equibiaxial initial stresses and elastic
   orthotropy. It was found that these factors can significantly influence
   curvature development. Comparison of experimental and numerical results
   suggested that plastic anisotropy should also be taken into account in
   future studies. The tools developed in this study show promises for the
   accurate prediction of peen forming process for large scale components.

Abstract = {{The oxidation behavior of SiC powders was studied using a

   analysis showed that intra-particle diffusion and chemical reaction
   controls the oxidation rate. Moreover, a new kinetics model was proposed
   to describe the oxidation rate of where all diffusion steps (bulk,
   inter- and intra-diffusion) and the chemical reaction may affect the
   overall reaction rate. The model was validated through a comparison with
   the experimental results obtained from the oxidation of SiC powders in
   TGA experiments. It was found that during the experiments, inter
   diffusion must also be taken account to describe adequately the
   oxidation rate. Numerical analysis indicated that inter-particle

Abstract = {{Pd-Co alloys electro catalysts were synthesized for the oxygen reduction
   reaction (ORR) for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells by a new
   ultrasonic spray method. This allows for the first time the preparation
   of reproducible small particle size with dominant dimensions between 2.5
   and 6.5 nm for all samples of the Pd-Co electro catalysts. This method
   is also based on less time consuming and steps than the classical
   methods. The physico-chemical properties of Pd-Co electro catalysts from
   different compositions were characterized. Samples of Pd/C, Pd5Co1/C,
   Pd3Co1/C, Pd2Co1/C, and 5 Pd1Co1/C where synthesized and Pt/C for
   comparison. The samples of Pd-Co alloys prepared here are substitution
   solid solutions where some atoms of Pd are replaced by Co atoms. Based
   on experimental bending energies, the main composition of the samples is
   found to be metallic Pd and Co. The physic-chemical composition and
   properties of the alloys were correlated to the ORR electro catalytic
   activity in an acid medium. A volcano plot was observed between the
   variation of the mass activity and the Pd content or Pd-Pd distance of
   the Pd-Co alloys. The optimum value of the mass activity was obtained
   for Pd3Co. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   bonds are achieved by a thorough optimization of surface conditioning
   using fast atom beams. Bonding at room temperature under high-vacuum
   conditions is systematically investigated after in situ surface
   deoxidization using either argon or helium fast atom beams. Using argon,
   high bond energies of up to 900 mJ/m(2) are obtained and further
   enhanced to achieve bulk strength through rapid annealing at 290 degrees
   C, thereby enabling the production of thermally stable and mechanically
   robust hybrid substrates. Moreover, the interface conductivity is
   significantly improved by an additional thermal annealing at 400 degrees
   C. Although it is anticipated to induce higher quality interfaces,
   helium treatment yields, however, limited and unstable bonding. This
   difference is attributed to an important surface nano-texturing that
   occurs during fast atom beam processing, a phenomenon that is peculiar
   to helium and absent in argon treatment. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Width bifurcation and dynamical phase transitions in open quantum
   systems}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 28}},
Abstract = {{The states of an open quantum system are coupled via the environment of
   scattering wave functions. The complex coupling coefficients omega
   between system and environment arise from the principal value integral
   and the residuum. At high-level density where the resonance states
   overlap, the dynamics of the system is determined by exceptional points.
   At these points, the eigenvalues of two states are equal and the
   corresponding eigenfunctions are linearly dependent. It is shown in the
   present paper that Im(omega) and Re(omega) influence the system
   properties differently in the surrounding of exceptional points.
   Controlling the system by a parameter, the eigenvalues avoid crossing in
   energy near an exceptional point under the influence of Re(omega) in a
   similar manner as it is well known from discrete states. Im(omega),
   however, leads to width bifurcation and finally (when the system is
   coupled to one channel, i.e., to one common continuum of scattering wave
   functions), to a splitting of the system into two parts with different
   characteristic time scales. The role of observer states is discussed.
   Physically, the system is stabilized by this splitting since the
   lifetimes of some states are longer than before, while that of one state
   is shorter. In the cross section the short-lived state appears as a
   background term in high-resolution experiments. The wave functions of
   the long-lived states are mixed in those of the original ones in a
   comparably large parameter range. Numerical results for the eigenvalues
   and eigenfunctions are shown for N = 2,4, and 10 states coupled mostly
   to one channel.}},

Title = {{Stress redistribution in individual ultrathin strained silicon
   nanowires: a high-resolution polarized Raman study}},
Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{MAY 28}},
Abstract = {{Strain nano-engineering provides valuable opportunities to create
   high-performance nanodevices by a precise tailoring of semiconductor
   band structure. Achieving these enhanced capabilities has sparked a
   surge of interest in controlling strain on the nanoscale. In this work,
   the stress behavior in ultrathin strained silicon nanowires directly on
   oxide is elucidated using background-free, high-resolution polarized
   Raman spectroscopy. We established a theoretical framework to quantify
   the stress from Raman shifts taking into account the anisotropy
   associated with the nanowire quasi-one-dimensional morphology. The
   investigated nanowires have lateral dimensions of 30, 50 and 80 nm and a
   length of 1 mu m top-down fabricated by patterning and etching 15 nm
   thick biaxially tensile strained silicon nanomembranes generated using
   heteroepitaxy and ultrathin layer transfer. The concern over the
   contribution of Raman scattering at the nanowire < 110 > oriented
   sidewalls is circumvented by precisely selecting the incident
   polarization relative to the sidewalls of the nanowire, thus enabling an
   accurate and rigorous analysis of stress profiles in individual
   nanowires. Unlike suspended nanowires, which become uniaxially strained
   as a result of free surface-induced relaxation, we demonstrated that
   stress profiles in single nanowires are rather complex and non-uniform
   along different directions due to the oxide-nanowire interface. As a
   general trend, higher stresses are observed at the center of the
   nanowire and found to decrease linearly as a function of the nanowire
   width. Using multi-wavelength high-resolution Raman spectroscopy, we
   also extracted the stress profiles at different depths in the nanowire.
   The residual stress in the top similar to 10 nm of the nanowire was
   found to be nearly uniaxial and increase from the edge toward the
   center, which remains highly strained. In contrast, the average stress
   profiles measured over the whole nanowire thickness exhibit different
   behavior characterized by a plateau in the region similar to 200 nm away
   from the edges. Our observations indicate that the lattice near the
   newly formed free surface moves inwards and drags the underlying
   substrate leading to a complex redistribution of stress. This nanoscale
   patterning-induced relaxation has direct implications for electrical and
   mechanical properties of strained silicon nanowires and provides myriad
   opportunities to create entirely new strained-engineered nanoscale
   devices.}},

Title = {{Deposition rate enhancement in HiPIMS without compromising the ionized
   fraction of the deposition flux}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{20}},

Abstract = {{We systematically investigate and quantify different physical phenomena
   influencing the deposition rate, a(D), of Nb coatings prepared by high
   power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS), and propose a
   straightforward approach for deposition rate enhancement through the
   control of the magnetron's magnetic field. The magnetic field strength
   at the target surface, B, of a 50 mm diameter magnetron was controlled
   by the application of paramagnetic spacers with different thicknesses in
   between the magnetron surface and the target. We found that lowering B
   achieved by the application of a 2.8 mm thick spacer led to an increase
   in a(D) by a factor of similar to 4.5 (from 10.6 to 45.2 nm min(-1))
   when the discharge was operated at a fixed average pulse target power
   density (2.5 kW cm(-2)). However, the ionized fraction of the deposition
   flux onto the substrate was found to be comparable, despite a large
   difference in B-dependent discharge characteristics (magnetron voltage
   and discharge current). We show that the decrease in a(D) commonly
   observed in HiPIMS (ranging from 33\% to 84\% in comparison with dc
   magnetron sputtering in the presented experiments) is governed by
   different physical processes, depending on the value of B: for high B,
   the back-attraction of the target ions towards the target is the
   dominant effect, while for low B the ion back-attraction, the sub-linear
   dependence of the sputtering yield on the ion energy, and the variation
   in material transport effects are all important. Finally, we offer a
   theoretical background for the observed results, demonstrating that the
   here-presented conclusions may be applicable to HiPIMS discharges using
   different metal targets and different inert gases.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{80}},
Pages = {{47-54}},
Month = {{MAY 17}},
Abstract = {{3-D reconstruction of Halloysite nanotube (HNT) polypropylene composite
   has been performed using two different methods. In the first method,
   several slices of the composite material were obtained using focused ion
   beam (FIB), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A representative
   volume element (RVE) of the real material's micro/nanostructures was
   then constructed by stacking these morphological images using VCAT (R)
   software. In the second method, SEM images of the nano-composite were
   used to extract statistical two-point correlation function (TPCF), for
   reconstruction of an RVE of the nano-composite.
   The resulting RVEs obtained from both methods were meshed for finite
   element (FE) simulation of deformation under tension and shear loadings.
   The FE results were then used to compute the stiffness tensor of the
   nano-composite.
   In the statistical approach, the TPCF was obtained from a none-Eigen
   microstructure which can partially reflect statistical information of
   the microstructure. The mechanical constants obtained from statistical
   RVEs using FEM approach shows a 5.7\% error compared with those obtained
   from real RVE, which could be attributed to the approximation using TPCF
   {[}1].
   It is concluded that the statistical method using TPCF alone can produce
   an approximate microstructure that should be modified using other
   statistical descriptor such as two-point cluster function and lineal
   path function to have better reconstruction of heterogeneous
   nano-composites {[}2]. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: This study investigated the oxidation of selected
   progestagenic steroid hormones by potassium permanganate at pH 6.0 and
   8.0 in ultrapure water and wastewater effluents, using bench-scale
   assays. Second order rate constants for the reaction of potassium
   permanganate with progestagens (levonorgestrel, medroxyprogesterone,
   norethindrone and progesterone) was determined as a function of pH,
   presence of natural organic matter and temperature. This work also
   illustrates the advantages of using a novel analytical method, the laser
   diode thermal desorption (LDTD-APCI) interface coupled to tandem mass
   spectrometry apparatus, allowing for the quick determination of
   oxidation rate constants and increasing sample throughput.
   Results: The second-order rate constants for progestagens with
   permanganate determined in bench-scale experiments ranged from 23 to 368

   6.0 and 8.0. Two pairs of progestagens exhibited similar reaction rate
   constants, i.e. progesterone and medroxyprogesterone (23 to 80 M-1
   sec(-1) in ultrapure water and 26 to 149 M-1 sec(-1) in wastewaters, at
   pH 6.0 and 8.0) and levonorgestrel and norethindrone (179 to 224 M-1
   sec(-1) in ultrapure water and 180 to 368 M-1 sec(-1) in wastewaters, at
   pH 6.0 and 8.0). The presence of dissolved natural organic matter and
   the pH conditions improved the oxidation rate constants for progestagens
   with potassium permanganate only at alkaline pH. Reaction rates measured
   in Milli-Q water could therefore be used to provide conservative
   estimates for the oxidation rates of the four selected progestagens in
   wastewaters when exposed to potassium permanganate. The progestagen
   removal efficiencies was lower for progesterone and medroxyprogesterone
   (48 to 87\%) than for levonorgestrel and norethindrone (78 to 97\%) in
   Milli-Q and wastewaters at pH 6.0-8.2 using potassium permanganate
   dosages of 1 to 5 mg L-1 after contact times of 10 to 60 min.
   Conclusion: This work presents the first results on the
   permanganate-promoted oxidation of progestagens, as a function of pH,
   temperature as well as NOM. Progestagen concentrations used to determine
   rate constants were analyzed using an ultrafast laser diode thermal
   desorption interface coupled to tandemmass spectrometry for the analysis
   of water sample for progestagens.}},

Abstract = {{Accumulation and breakthrough of several potentially toxic
   cyanobacterial species within drinking water treatment plants (DWTP)
   have been reported recently. The objectives of this project were to test
   the efficiency of different treatment barriers in cyanobacterial
   removal. Upon observation of cyanobacterial blooms, intensive sampling
   was conducted inside a full scale DWTP at raw water, clarification,
   filtration and oxidation processes. Samples were taken for microscopic
   speciation/enumeration and microcystins analysis. Total cyanobacteria
   cell numbers exceeded World Health Organisation and local alert levels
   in raw water (6,90,000 cells/mL). Extensive accumulation of
   cyanobacteria species in sludge beds and filters, and interruption of
   treatment were observed. Aphanizomenon cells were poorly coagulated and
   they were not trapped efficiently in the sludge. It was also
   demonstrated that Aphanizomenon cells passed through and were not
   retained over the filter. However, Microcystis, Anabaena, and
   Pseudanabaena cells were adequately removed by clarification and
   filtration processes. The breakthrough of non toxic cyanobacterial cells
   into DWTPs could also result in severe treatment disruption leading to
   plant shutdown. Application of intervention threshold values restricted
   to raw water does not take into consideration the major long term
   accumulation of potentially toxic cells in the sludge and the risk of
   toxins release. Thus, a sampling regime inside the plant adapted to
   cyanobacterial occurrence and intensity is recommended. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Two artificial neural networks (ANNs) are constructed, trained, and
   tested to map inputs of a complex trunk finite element (FE) model to its
   outputs for spinal loads and muscle forces. Five input variables (thorax
   flexion angle, load magnitude, its anterior and lateral positions, load
   handling technique, i.e., one- or two-handed static lifting) and four
   model outputs (L4-L5 and L5-S1 disc compression and anterior-posterior
   shear forces) for spinal loads and 76 model outputs (forces in
   individual trunk muscles) are considered. Moreover, full quadratic
   regression equations mapping input-outputs of the model developed here
   for muscle forces and previously for spine loads are used to compare the
   relative accuracy of these two mapping tools (ANN and regression
   equations). Results indicate that the ANNs are more accurate in mapping
   input-output relationships of the FE model (RMSE= 20.7 N for spinal
   loads and RMSE= 4.7 N for muscle forces) as compared to regression
   equations (RMSE= 120.4 N for spinal loads and RMSE=43.2 N for muscle
   forces). Quadratic regression equations map up to second order
   variations of outputs with inputs while ANNs capture higher order
   variations too. Despite satisfactory achievement in estimating overall
   muscle forces by the ANN, some inadequacies are noted including
   assigning force to antagonistic muscles with no activity in the
   optimization algorithm of the FE model or predicting slightly different
   forces in bilateral pair muscles in symmetric lifting activities. Using
   these user-friendly tools spine loads and trunk muscle forces during
   symmetric and asymmetric static lifts can be easily estimated. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{We present a theoretical and experimental study that reveals the
   physical mechanism underlying the response of an in-resonance gold
   nanorod (AuNR) in water to a near-infrared ultrafast laser pulse.
   Results reveal the presence of two different regimes of interaction,
   depending on the irradiation fluence. For fluences below 3 mJ/cm(2),
   AuNRs are in the so-called absorption regime and are shown to strongly
   absorb energy, leading to a fast temperature increase revealed by the
   onset of characteristic mechanical vibration of the structure. In situ
   measurement demonstrates a permanent deformation of the AuNRs occurring
   for fluences over 100 mu J/cm(2). In the absorption regime, we show the
   formation of a nanoscale plasma around the structure, dominated by a
   photothermal emission from the AuNR, and the generation of a pressure
   wave. However, no cavitation occurs under the deformation threshold
   fluence (100 mu J/cm(2)). For fluences over 3 mJ/cm(2), in the
   near-field regime, the energy transfer is dominated by the enhanced
   near-field around the particle that directly ionizes and heats a
   nanoplasma in the surrounding water. We theoretically show that bubbles
   with diameters approximate to 490 nm can be generated in this near-field
   regime for an incident fluence of 200 mJ/cm(2). In situ optical
   characterization of the produced bubbles supports this result and shows
   that bubbles with diameters approximate to 200-600 nm can be generated
   for fluences ranging 100-400 mJ/cm(2). Important shielding of the
   laser-nanostructure interaction by the surrounding plasma is shown to
   decrease considerably the near-field enhancement, the energy absorption,
   and the diameter of the generated bubbles and may explain the smaller
   bubbles generated around in-resonance 10 x 41 nm(2) AuNRs when compared
   to off-resonance 25 X 60 nm(2) AuNRs and 100 nm AuNPs.}},

Title = {{Analytical technologies for influenza virus-like particle candidate
   vaccines: challenges and emerging approaches}},
Journal = {{VIROLOGY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{MAY 4}},
Abstract = {{Influenza virus-like particle vaccines are one of the most promising
   ways to respond to the threat of future influenza pandemics. VLPs are
   composed of viral antigens but lack nucleic acids making them
   non-infectious which limit the risk of recombination with wild-type
   strains. By taking advantage of the advancements in cell culture
   technologies, the process from strain identification to manufacturing
   has the potential to be completed rapidly and easily at large scales.
   After closely reviewing the current research done on influenza VLPs, it
   is evident that the development of quantification methods has been
   consistently overlooked. VLP quantification at all stages of the
   production process has been left to rely on current influenza
   quantification methods (i.e. Hemagglutination assay (HA), Single Radial
   Immunodiffusion assay (SRID), NA enzymatic activity assays, Western
   blot, Electron Microscopy). These are analytical methods developed
   decades ago for influenza virions and final bulk influenza vaccines.
   Although these methods are time-consuming and cumbersome they have been
   sufficient for the characterization of final purified material.
   Nevertheless, these analytical methods are impractical for in-line
   process monitoring because VLP concentration in crude samples generally
   falls out of the range of detection for these methods. This consequently
   impedes the development of robust influenza-VLP production and
   purification processes. Thus, development of functional process
   analytical techniques, applicable at every stage during production, that
   are compatible with different production platforms is in great need to
   assess, optimize and exploit the full potential of novel manufacturing
   platforms.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an ultra-fast algorithm for the computation of multiphase
   short-circuit currents at all buses is proposed by addressing the
   concept of selected inversion. The short circuit summary is achieved
   through the computation of multiphase Thevenin equivalent at each bus by
   using the augmented nodal matrix. This typically requires the sequential
   solution of linear system of equations, i.e., direct inversion which can
   be demanding in terms of CPU time. In this paper, it is shown that
   dramatic gains in computational time can be obtained when the selected
   inversion (SelInv) technique is performed where only a subset of entries
   of the inverse of augmented nodal matrix is computed. These entries
   include the phase domain Thevenin impedances seen from network buses
   which are used in the computation of short-circuit currents with the
   predefined boundary conditions specific to the fault type. The
   performance of the method is demonstrated with very large scale and
   realistic distribution systems.}},

Abstract = {{Processor customisation is an effective technique to enhance performance
   across an application domain. In this study, the authors present a new
   customised soft processor development environment called polytechnique
   customised soft processor (PolyCuSP), which bridges the gap between
   architecture description languages (ADLs) and extensible soft
   processors. The main objective of this environment is to facilitate
   rapid design space exploration while preserving a wide range of
   customisation flexibility. For this purpose, PolyCuSP offers full
   flexibility in instruction-set description, while limiting the datapath
   customisation to a predefined set of tunable microarchitectural
   parameters. The environment avoids extensive datapath description that
   is unnecessary for usual microarchitectural customisation techniques in
   order to simplify the development process. A new XML-based description
   format is introduced for instruction-set modelling. Experimental results
   evaluate and compare the design and customisation complexities offered
   by PolyCuSP with competitive approaches. Results demonstrate the
   efficiency of applying customisation techniques in the proposed
   environment. For the Sobel edge detection algorithm, the results show
   that microarchitectural tuning and instruction-set architecture
   customisation improve the performance-per-cost ratio by an average of 44
   and 27\%, respectively. Furthermore, in a case study of a tone-mapping
   algorithm, PolyCuSP achieves an average improvement of 38\% in
   performance-per-cost ratio over an ADL-based design applying the same
   customisations.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time simulation allows rapid deployment and thorough testing of
   prototyped hardware in the automotive and aerospace industries. However,
   the simulation of power electronic circuits (PECs) in the context of
   PC-based simulations is challenging for several reasons, and imposes a
   limit in the 1-5 kHz range to the achievable switching frequencies. As
   FPGA devices gain computing power, conducting the real-time simulation
   of PECs on chip becomes an attractive alternative. This paper
   demonstrates the feasibility of high-performance floating-point
   calculation engines aimed for the real-time simulation of PECs on
   high-end and low-cost FPGAs as well. The paper discusses emerging
   paradigms for reconfigurable floating-point computing that favor optimal
   performance and offer near double precision arithmetic at a minimal
   hardware cost. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by
   considering three different circuit topologies and simulating their
   high-frequency stimulation (20 kHz) using the same automated calculation
   engine. The considered circuits are a boost converter, a two-level
   three-phase bridge, and a two-level-three-phase bridge driven by a boost
   converter. (c) 2012 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Operational planning is an activity carried out by all manufacturing and
   logistical companies. Its co-ordination with supply chain partners aims
   at synchronising resources utilisation in order to minimise
   inefficiencies, such as unnecessary inventory holding, or in order to
   improve revenue through better resource utilisation. It is a rather
   complex process as partners have different objectives and information
   asymmetry is part of any effort to find good co-ordination solutions.
   Furthermore, because supply chains evolve in a dynamic and uncertain
   environment, once a co-ordination of operations plans is achieved, input
   data, such as forecasts or resources' status, can change and affect on
   hand plans. These dynamic changes not only require updating the plan
   that is directly affected by the changes, but it also requires the
   adjustment of all plans that are part of the same co-ordination solution
   (Stadtler, H. 2009. A framework for collaborative planning and
   state-of-the-art. OR Spectrum, 31 (1), 530). Therefore, the development
   of a practical co-ordination approach should be capable of dealing with
   these dynamic changes. This paper proposes a dynamic mutual adjustment
   search heuristic, which can be used to co-ordinate the operations plans
   of two independent supply chain partners, linked by material and
   non-strategic information flows. Computational analysis shows that the
   proposed approach produces a win-win strategy in the context of two
   supply chain partners, and improves the results of upstream planning in

Abstract = {{The influence of reactive compatibilization on the foaming behavior of
   thermoplastic olefin blends of polypropylene and a metallocene-catalyzed
   ethylene octene copolymer was investigated. A batch setup was used to
   foam the samples using carbon dioxide as blowing agent. Solubility
   measurements were performed to determine the relative amount of gas
   concentration in the pressurized polymers before foaming. A microscopic
   method based on the back-scattered electron imaging technique was used
   to determine the respective locations of the bubbles and the dispersed
   elastomeric domains in the polypropylene matrix. It was shown that the
   bubbles are preferentially formed in the dispersed elastomeric domains.
   A clear relationship was established between the microstructure of the
   blends prepared with different levels of compatibilizer and the final
   cellular morphology of the microcellular thermoplastic olefin foams. The
   initial morphology of the blends was also altered by quiescent
   coarsening as well as shear-induced phase coalescence, and the impact of
   the morphological transitions on the cellular structure of the resulting
   foams was investigated. Dynamic shear and transient measurements of
   elongation were performed to characterize the viscoelastic behavior of
   the thermoplastic olefins. It was shown that the addition of a
   compatibilizer resulted in enhanced viscoelastic properties at low
   frequencies as well as increased levels of strain hardening, especially
   at low strain rates. The reactive compatibilization could significantly
   improve the melt foamability through control of the blend microstructure
   as well as enhancement of the melt rheological properties.}},

Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON RECONFIGURABLE TECHNOLOGY AND SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Advances in semiconductor technology brings to the market incredibly
   dense devices, capable of handling tens to hundreds floating-point
   operators on a single chip; so do the latest field programmable gate
   arrays (FPGAs). In order to alleviate the complexity of resorting to
   these devices in computationally intensive applications, this article
   proposes hardware schemes for the realization of addition-related
   floating-point operators based on the self-alignment technique (SAT).
   The article demonstrates that the schemes guarantee an accuracy as if
   summation was computed accurately in the precision of operator's
   internal mantissa, then faithfully rounded to working precision. To
   achieve such performance, the article adopts the redundant high radix
   carry-save (HRCS) format for the rapid addition of wide mantissas.
   Implementation results show that combining the SAT and the HRCS format
   allows the implementation of complex operators with reduced area and
   latency, more so when a fused-path approach is adopted. The article also
   proposes a new hardware operator for performing endomorphic HRCS
   additions and presents a new technique for speeding up the conversion
   from the redundant HRCS to a conventional binary format.}},

Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Traceability is the only means to ensure that the source code of a
   system is consistent with its requirements and that all and only the
   specified requirements have been implemented by developers. During
   software maintenance and evolution, requirement traceability links
   become obsolete because developers do not/cannot devote effort to
   updating them. Yet, recovering these traceability links later is a
   daunting and costly task for developers. Consequently, the literature
   has proposed methods, techniques, and tools to recover these
   traceability links semi-automatically or automatically. Among the
   proposed techniques, the literature showed that information retrieval
   (IR) techniques can automatically recover traceability links between
   free-text requirements and source code. However, IR techniques lack
   accuracy (precision and recall). In this paper, we show that mining
   software repositories and combining mined results with IR techniques can
   improve the accuracy (precision and recall) of IR techniques and we
   propose Trustrace, a trust-based traceability recovery approach. We
   apply Trustrace on four medium-size open-source systems to compare the
   accuracy of its traceability links with those recovered using
   state-of-the-art IR techniques from the literature, based on the Vector
   Space Model and Jensen-Shannon model. The results of Trustrace are up to
   22.7 percent more precise and have 7.66 percent better recall values
   than those of the other techniques, on average. We thus show that mining
   software repositories and combining the mined data with existing results
   from IR techniques improves the precision and recall of requirement
   traceability links.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Geometrically nonlinear free vibrations of closed isotropic cylindrical
   shells are investigated through an analytical-numerical model. The
   method developed is a combination of Sanders-Koiter nonlinear shell
   theory and the finite element method. The cylindrical shell is
   subdivided into cylindrical finite elements and the displacement
   functions are derived from exact solutions of Sander's equations for
   thin cylindrical shells. Expressions for the mass, linear and nonlinear
   stiffness matrices are determined by exact analytical integration.
   Various boundary conditions of shell and in-plane effects are
   considered. Nonlinear responses are analyzed using the Runge-Kutta
   numerical method. The nonlinear frequency ratio is determined with
   respect to the amplitude thickness ratio of the motion for different
   study cases. Detailed numerical results are presented for various
   parameters for a closed isotropic shell, indicating either hardening or
   softening types of nonlinear behaviors, depending on the structure data.
   The present results show good agreement with the published ones for
   several cases of shells. This research clarifies the current
   disagreement about various types of cylindrical shells with geometric
   nonlinearities.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and its variants, is a more viable
   technology than the addition of surface active agents to modify
   nanoparticle surfaces. While thermally-activated CVD simply works by
   initiating the monomers using heat, some other techniques are more
   powerful and versatile. Indeed, higher energy CVD methods open up
   possibilities to a wider range of monomers. Unfortunately, different
   terminologies and classifications due to parallel work have led to
   confusion. This paper presents and explains the different techniques as
   well as their equivalent terminologies to clarify the big picture. While
   the demand for functionalized nanoparticles grows rapidly, current
   functionalization methods are still too expensive for most applications.
   This paper is intended to be a practical review of the gas phase methods
   available in order to identify a potential candidate for large scale
   functionalization of nanoparticles. This study identifies

Abstract = {{In this paper, we analyze the promising yet mostly unexplored ability of
   opportunistic spectrum access (USA) based on cognitive radios (CR) to
   provide a robust infrastructure for wireless networks operating in
   challenging environments with frequent transmission link disruptions. We
   consider a general network model where the CR users can utilize spectrum
   sensing and channel switching to determine the status of a channel and
   use a restoration process when a link failure occurs. We first classify
   the reliability metrics in CR networks based on the perspective and
   severity of the failures. We then derive analytical relations for the
   mean time to failure (MTTF) and mean time to repair (MTTR) of the CR
   users. With the proposed USA channel restoration scheme, we show that
   the MTTF between hard failures, where a user cannot communicate for a
   long interval, increases exponentially with the number of channels
   available to the CR users. When a failure occurs, the MTTR also
   decreases exponentially with the number of channels, thereby providing a
   highly robust communication environment. Finally, we provide design
   guidelines that can be used to evaluate the tradeoffs between the number
   of users and channels versus the required reliability. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Introduction: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive
   neurodegenerative disorder affecting lower and upper motor neurons.
   Degeneration of the lateral corticospinal tract (CST) is a key finding
   in ALS cervical spinal cord autopsies. We hypothesized that in vivo
   ultra-high-field MRI of the cervical spinal cord can detect abnormality
   in the CST. Methods: A patient with ALS (disease duration 23 months) and
   a healthy control were scanned at 7-T MRI using a 19-channel coil.
   Multi-echo T2{*}-weighted imaging was performed in the spinal cord,
   covering C2C6. Cross-sectional resolution was 0.37 x 0.37 mm2. Results:
   We detected clear signal hyperintensity in both segments of the lateral
   CST in the ALS patient, which was significant when compared with the
   normal control subject (P < 107). Conclusion: We believe there are
   potential benefits of 7-T MRI for increased sensitivity and spatial
   accuracy in characterizing pathology in the spinal cord. Muscle Nerve

Abstract = {{The effect of clay and chain extender on the nonisothermal, isothermal
   crystallization kinetics, and morphology of polylactide (PLA) was
   investigated in this study. PLA and PLA-based nanocomposites containing
   2 wt\% organoclay were prepared via melt compounding. Three commercially
   available chain extenders were used: polycarbodiimide (PCDI),
   tris(nonylphenyl) phosphite (TNPP), and Joncryl ADR4368F. The nanoclay
   particles were found to act as nucleating agents. Chain extender
   incorporation, however, had diverse effects on both crystallization rate
   and degree of crystallinity. Nonisothermal DSC results revealed that the
   addition of PCDI increased the cold-crystallization temperature (Tc)
   from 106 to 114 degrees C, reduced the degree of crystallinity from 6.3
   to 5.3\%, and resulted in the formation of bimodal melting peaks in PLA.
   On the other hand, the reduction of chain ends in the presence of TNPP
   resulted in a significant increase of the crystallization rate and
   degree of crystallinity from 6.3 to 15.2\%. In the case of Joncryl, its
   incorporation led to the formation of a long-chain branching structure,
   which disrupted the chain packing. Therefore, the degree of
   crystallinity (from 6.3 to 1.6\%) and the rate of crystallization
   decreased, while Tc was increased from 106 to 122 degrees C in the
   presence of Joncryl. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 2013. (c) Society of Plastics

   measurements of the dynamic density of the particle bed. Four different
   flow states were observed as the level of interparticle forces was
   increased. The results are reported in a flow map that compares the
   forces that come into play in the spheronizer with other interparticle
   forces encountered during wet granulation processes. By isolating the

Journal = {{SUPERCONDUCTOR SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{High temperature superconductor Roebel cables are well known for their
   large current capacity and low AC losses. For this reason they have
   become attractive candidates for many power applications. The continuous
   transposition of their strands reduces the coupling losses while
   ensuring better current sharing among them. However, since Roebel cables
   have a true 3D structure and are made of several high aspect ratio
   coated conductors, modelling and simulation of their electromagnetic
   properties is very challenging. Therefore, a realistic model taking into
   account the actual layout of the cable is unavoidably a large scale
   computational problem. In this work, we present a full 3D model of a
   Roebel cable with 14 strands. The model is based on the H-formulation,
   widely used for 2D problems. In order to keep the 3D features of the
   cable (in particular the magnetization currents near the
   transpositions), no simplifications are made other than the reduction of
   the modelled length according to the periodicity of the cable structure.
   The 3D model is used to study the dependence of AC losses on the
   amplitude of the AC applied magnetic field or transport current. Beyond
   the importance of simulating the Roebel cable layout, this work
   represents a further step into achieving 3D simulation of
   superconducting devices for real applications.}},

Abstract = {{Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and
   polarization tests were used to monitor the progress of the anode
   colonization by electrode-reducing microorganisms in a single-chamber
   membraneless microbial fuel cell seeded with anaerobic sludge. The
   electrochemical methods showed that an increase in microbial fuel cell
   power output coincided with a progressive decrease of the anode internal
   resistance and a more negative open circuit potential. Two redox systems
   were observed in cyclic voltammograms shortly after microbial fuel cell
   startup, while a redox system with a peak around -330 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl)
   was predominant in the mature biofilm. The redox systems were also
   dependent on the external resistance chosen for microbial fuel cell
   operation. This suggests that within the diverse microbial populations
   several species are capable of electron transfer to the anode, and that
   the microorganisms with the highest electron transfer rate become
   predominant. Furthermore, the growth of these electrode-reducing
   microorganisms can be accelerated by optimizing the microbial fuel cell

Abstract = {{A study was conducted to assess the impact of media aging on
   Cryptosporidium parvum transport and retention in granular filters.
   Column experiments were conducted with sand, anthracite, and granular
   activated carbon (GAC) filters. All columns possessed an identical
   filter design and grain size distribution. Oocyst removal was evaluated
   with both new and aged media. The variation in performance among new
   media was attributed to the shape of the tested granular media and to
   the concentration of extractable metals on the surface of collector
   grains. Media aging significantly increased the treatment performance of
   sand (26\%) and GAC (31\%) but had no influence on the performance of
   anthracite. This enhanced performance of aged media correlated well with
   the extent of biofilm development. The best removal performance was
   observed with aged GAC ( 71 +/- 2\%), which supported the highest amount
   of biomass according to polysaccharide and protein measurements. The
   results of this investigation are of particular interest because they
   suggest that media aging increases the removal of protozoan parasites in
   full-scale granular filters. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0000672.

Abstract = {{The modified Kovacs (MK) model is a versatile and practical tool to
   estimate the water retention curve (WRC) of soils from their basic
   properties. However, the MK model has not yet been introduced in many
   codes or analytical solutions; most applications rather use the Brooks
   and Corey (BC) and/or van Genuchten (vG) formulations to express the
   WRC. The authors propose in this paper a direct conversion of the MK
   model parameters to the BC and vG equations parameters for sandy and
   silty materials. The proposed equations were developed using data from
   15 types of sandy soils and 14 low-plasticity silts and validated using
   16 other soils. The results presented in this paper indicate how the BC
   and vG equations parameters can be successfully predicted from the MK
   model parameters. The conversion procedure provides a practical means to
   estimate the WRC from the basic geotechnical properties of soils and to
   express this curve using three different mathematical formulations: MK,
   vG, and BC. These expressions allow obtaining a rapid estimation of the
   BC and vG model parameters that are frequently used in analytical
   solutions and commercial numerical codes to simulate unsaturated soil
   water flow. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)IR.1943-4774.0000563.(C) 2013 American

Journal = {{INFOR}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{64-75}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In the service industry, the multi-activity and task assignment problem
   consists of assigning various activities and tasks to given work shifts.
   An activity has a time-dependent continuous demand (number of employees
   required to service the customers) and is interruptible, i.e., an
   employee assigned to it can be relieved at any time. At the opposite, a
   task has a specific duration, is performed once by a single employee,
   and is uninterruptible. In this paper, we consider an extension of this
   problem, called the multi-activity and team task assignment problem
   where the tasks can be undertaken in different ways by several employees
   simultaneously. We propose a mixed integer programming formulation and a
   two-module approach to find solutions to this problem. In the first
   module, an approximation model for assigning tasks without activities is
   solved by a mixed integer programming solver. The second module consists
   of a column generation model for assigning activities by allowing task
   reassignments during the process. These modules are used within a
   variable neighborhood descent heuristic. We have performed extensive
   computational experiments to validate our approach.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THERMODYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{19-24}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The observed ``flattened{''} shape of liquid miscibility gaps in binary
   alloys is not easily reproduced by a simple Gibbs energy equation
   involving a random-mixing Bragg-Williams (BW) expression for the
   configurational entropy and a polynomial expansion of the excess Gibbs
   energy since short-range-ordering (SRO) is not taken into account. It is
   shown that accounting for the SRO through a simple application of the
   modified quasi-chemical model (MQM) in the nearest-neighbour pair
   approximation is sufficient to provide a good representation of
   miscibility gaps using only a very few temperature-independent
   coefficients. For the many systems in which the only data available are
   the miscibility gap boundaries at lower temperatures, the MQM can
   therefore provide a good prediction of the gap boundaries at higher
   temperatures, as well as of the excess enthalpy. Furthermore, the MQM
   provides a significantly better prediction of the miscibility gap in a
   ternary system based only upon optimized model parameters of its three
   binary sub-systems than does the BW polynomial model. For binary systems
   in which deviations from ideal behaviour are not too large, it is shown
   that the MQM can be approximated by one additional term in the
   polynomial BW expression involving no additional empirical coefficients.

Abstract = {{Bioaccessibility is a measurement of a substance's solubility in the
   human gastro-intestinal system, and is often used in the risk assessment
   of soils. The present study was designed to determine the variability
   among laboratories using different methods to measure the
   bioaccessibility of 24 inorganic contaminants in one standardized soil
   sample, the standard reference material NIST 2710. Fourteen laboratories
   used a total of 17 bioaccessibility extraction methods. The variability
   between methods was assessed by calculating the reproducibility relative
   standard deviations (RSDs), where reproducibility is the sum of
   within-laboratory and between-laboratory variability. Whereas
   within-laboratory repeatability was usually better than (<) 15\% for
   most elements, reproducibility RSDs were much higher, indicating more
   variability, although for many elements they were comparable to typical
   uncertainties (e.g., 30\% in commercial laboratories). For five trace
   elements of interest, reproducibility RSDs were: arsenic (As), 2244\%;
   cadmium (Cd), 1141\%; Cu, 1530\%; lead (Pb), 4583\%; and Zn, 1856\%.
   Only one method variable, pH, was found to correlate significantly with
   bioaccessibility for aluminum (Al), Cd, copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), Pb
   and zinc (Zn) but other method variables could not be examined
   systematically because of the study design. When bioaccessibility
   results were directly compared with bioavailability results for As
   (swine and mouse) and Pb (swine), four methods returned results within
   uncertainty ranges for both elements: two that were defined as simpler
   (gastric phase only, limited chemicals) and two were more complex
   (gastric + intestinal phases, with a mixture of chemicals).}},

Abstract = {{Internet energy consumption is rapidly becoming a critical issue due to
   the exponential traffic growth and the rapid expansion of communication
   infrastructures worldwide. We address the problem of energy-aware
   intra-domain traffic engineering in networks operated with a shortest
   path routing protocol. We consider the problem of switching off (putting
   in sleep mode) network elements (links and routers) and of adjusting the
   link weights so as to minimize the energy consumption as well as a
   network congestion measure. To tackle this multi-objective optimization
   problem with priority (first minimize the energy consumption and then
   the network congestion), we propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming
   based algorithm for Energy-aware Weights Optimization (MILP-EWO). Our
   heuristic exploits the Interior Gateway Protocol Weight Optimization
   (IGP-WO) algorithm for optimizing the OSPF link weights so as to
   minimize the total cost of link utilization. The computational results
   obtained for eight real network topologies and different types of
   traffic matrices show that it is possible to switch off a substantial
   number of nodes and links during low and moderate traffic periods, while
   guaranteeing that network congestion is low enough to ensure service
   quality. The proposed approach is also validated on two networks of
   emulated Linux routers. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The multi-vehicle covering tour problem (m-CTP) involves finding a
   minimum-length set of vehicle routes passing through a subset of
   vertices, subject to constraints on the length of each route and the
   number of vertices that it contains, such that each vertex not included
   in any route lies within a given distance of a route. This paper tackles
   a particular case of m-CTP where only the restriction on the number of
   vertices is considered, i.e., the constraint on the length is relaxed.
   The problem is solved by a branch-and-cut algorithm and a metaheuristic.
   To develop the branch-and-cut algorithm, we use a new integer
   programming formulation based on a two-commodity flow model. The
   metaheuristic is based on the evolutionary local search (ELS) method
   proposed in {[}23]. Computational results are reported for a set of test
   problems derived from the TSPLIB. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In an effort to quantitatively assess the impact of recombinant protein
   expression on the primary metabolism of mammalian cells in culture, we
   have employed an efficient inducible expression system and conducted a
   comparative study of the intracellular flux map distribution with and
   without the induction of recombinant protein synthesis. Cells were grown
   in parallel semi-continuous cultures with various singly and uniformly
   labeled substrates and the resulting mass isotopomer distributions of
   lactate and extracellular amino acids were measured by mass
   spectrometry. These distributions were used to quantify the main
   intracellular fluxes. The analysis revealed that, under mild hypothermic
   conditions, the onset of protein expression is correlated with small but
   significant changes in several key pathways related to ATP and NADPH
   formation. More specifically, we observed that induced cells exhibit a
   more efficient utilization of glucose, characterized by an increased
   flux of pyruvate into the TCA cycle. In contrast, the catabolic rates of
   most amino acids remained relatively unaffected. Such analysis is
   instrumental to guide the identification of robust biomarkers of
   productivity, as well as the development of medium formulations
   optimized for recombinant protein production. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{172-180}},
Month = {{APR 5}},
Abstract = {{In dynamic optimization problems, the optimal input profiles are
   typically obtained using models that predict the system behavior. In
   practice, however, process models are often inaccurate, and on-line
   model adaptation is required for appropriate prediction and
   re-optimization. In most dynamic real-time optimization schemes, the
   available measurements are used to update the plant model, with
   uncertainty being lumped into selected uncertain plant parameters;
   furthermore, a piecewise-constant parameterization is used for the input
   profiles. This paper argues that the knowledge of the necessary
   conditions of optimality (NCO) can help devise more efficient and more
   robust real-time optimization schemes. Ideally, the structuring
   decisions involve the NCO as follows: (i) one measures or estimates the
   plant NCO, (ii) a NCO-based input parameterization is used, and (iii)
   model adaptation is performed to meet the plant NCO. The benefit of
   using the NCO in dynamic real-time optimization is illustrated in
   simulation through the comparison of various schemes for solving a
   final-time optimal control problem in the presence of uncertainty. (C)

   efficiency of phage-functionalized surfaces was studied. We found that
   whereas the physisorption of phages to gold surfaces affects their
   biofunctionality, as expressed by their lysing efficiency of bacteria,
   phages bound via mixed self-assembled monolayers of L-cysteine and
   11-mercaptoundecanoic acid permitted both the recognition and disruption
   of bacterial membranes. This is due to the formation of uniform islands
   on the gold surfaces, permitting an oriented positioning of the phages,
   thus better exposing their recognition proteins.}},

   L-cysteine is a rapid process, involving both amino- and thiol-Au
   interactions, followed by the exchange of amino-Au to thiol-Au species
   and the physisorption of a second cysteine layer. The formation of MUA
   is also rapid, followed by a slower structural rearrangement of the
   monolayer. We find that monolayer formation, For both L-cysteine and
   MUA, is described by the Langmuir isotherm at low concentrations only.
   Numerical models are introduced to describe the assembly of both higher

Title = {{Colossal injection of catalyst atoms into silicon nanowires}},
Journal = {{NATURE}},

Abstract = {{The incorporation of impurities during the growth of nanowires from the
   vapour phase alters their basic properties substantially, and this
   process is critical in an extended range of emerging nanometre-scale
   technologies(1-4). In particular, achieving precise control of the
   behaviour of group III and group V dopants has been a crucial step in
   the development of silicon (Si) nanowire-based devices(5-7).
   Recently(8-11) it has been demonstrated that the use of aluminium (Al)
   as a growth catalyst, instead of the usual gold, also yields an
   effective p-type doping, thereby enabling a novel and efficient route to
   functionalizing Si nanowires. Besides the technological implications,
   this self-doping implies the detachment of Al from the catalyst and its
   injection into the growing nanowire, involving atomic-scale processes
   that are crucial for the fundamental understanding of the catalytic
   assembly of nanowires. Here we present an atomic-level, quantitative
   study of this phenomenon of catalyst dissolution by three-dimensional
   atom-by-atom mapping of individual Al-catalysed Si nanowires using
   highly focused ultraviolet-laser-assisted atom-probe tomography.
   Although the observed incorporation of the catalyst atoms into nanowires
   exceeds by orders of magnitude the equilibrium solid solubility(12) and
   solid-solution concentrations in known non-equilibrium processes(13,14),
   the Al impurities are found to be homogeneously distributed in the
   nanowire and do not form precipitates or clusters. As well as the
   anticipated effect on the electrical properties, this kinetics-driven
   colossal injection also has direct implications for nanowire morphology.
   We discuss the observed strong deviation from equilibrium using a model
   of solute trapping at step edges, and identify the key growth parameters
   behind this phenomenon on the basis of a kinetic model of step-flow
   growth of nanowires. The control of this phenomenon provides
   opportunities to create a new class of nanoscale devices by precisely
   tailoring the shape and composition of metal-catalysed nanowires.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel method to investigate the grasp sequence of

   considers the magnitude and the sign of the torques generated on the
   phalanges of the finger through the contact points. By using these
   torques as indices, the algorithm calculates the values of the joint
   angles during the grasping sequence until the finger reaches its final
   configuration. To illustrate the effectiveness of this method a class of
   a 3-DOF adaptive finger is chosen and analyzed and then, using the
   proposed methodology, its grasp configuration is calculated when
   grasping different fixed objects. Finally, simulations are repeated
   using a dynamic simulation package and the obtained results are compared
   to the proposed method. The results show that the method can properly
   estimate the final configuration of the grasp.}},

Abstract = {{Bessel beams are proposed as a practical way to generate well collimated
   and confined beams at mm-waves or THz for quasi-optical applications. To
   achieve that, we propose the use of two-dimensional antenna arrays as
   realizable launchers. Truncated Bessel beams with a main lobe width of
   few wavelengths (lambda) can propagate over several hundreds of lambda
   if the antenna aperture is electrically large. Because such a large
   aperture would require a large number of antenna elements, sub-sampling
   distributions are proposed in this work. It is found that arrays with
   spacings of approximately 4 lambda generate high quality beams with very
   low amplitude oscillations over distances of about 300 lambda in vacuum.
   The optimal excitation function for such arrays greatly departs from the
   Bessel one. It is synthesized with an analytical method based on a least
   mean square error minimization. The synthesis method is scalar, but the
   pseudo-Bessel beams obtained are vectorial and linearly polarized.
   Theoretical predictions are confirmed by full-wave simulations using
   Ansoft Designer.}},

   a result, a fast or a slow scanning is possible by appropriate choice of
   the periodicity without changing the substrate parameters. Leakage
   characteristics of an SINRD waveguide for different parametric
   variations are discussed. Measurement results are provided.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses two variants of the shortest path method and their
   parallel implementation on a shared-memory system. One variant is
   designed to perform raytracing in models with stepwise distributions of
   interval velocity while the other is better suited for continuous
   velocity models. Both rely on a discretization scheme where primary
   nodes are located at the corners of cuboid cells and where secondary
   nodes are found on the edges and sides of the cells. The parallel
   implementations allow raytracing concurrently for different sources,
   providing an attractive framework for ray-based tomography. The accuracy
   and performance of the implementations were measured by comparison with
   the analytic solution for a layered model and for a vertical gradient
   model. Mean relative error less than 0.2\% was obtained with 5 secondary
   nodes for the layered model and 9 secondary nodes for the gradient
   model. Parallel performance depends on the level of discretization
   refinement, on the number of threads, and on the problem size, with the
   most determinant variable being the level of discretization refinement
   (number of secondary nodes). The results indicate that a good trade-off
   between speed and accuracy is achieved with the number of secondary
   nodes equal to 5. The programs are written in C-Hand rely on the
   Standard Template Library and OpenMP. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The electrodynamics of type-II superconductors is considered in the
   quasi-static limit when the concept of the so-called critical state is
   well applicable to the superconductors. We review analytical techniques
   and formulas used to describe the critical states in the superconductors
   of the various shapes characteristic of high-temperature superconducting
   materials. In particular, it is explained how 3-D critical-state
   problems for thin planar superconductors can be reduced to more simple
   2-D problems. Within this approach, the critical states in a thin
   infinitely long superconducting strip are analytically described not
   only in the simplest case of a constant critical current density j(c)
   but also in the case of anisotropic flux-line pinning and for simple
   model dependence of jc on the magnetic-field magnitude. We also present
   the analytical solutions of the critical-state problem for
   superconducting strips with ferromagnetic substrates and for various
   arrays of superconducting strips with a transport current or in an
   external magnetic field. In particular, one of the discussed
   configurations of the strips can model superconducting power
   transmission cables. We also describe some analytical solutions of the
   electrodynamic equations for type-II superconductors with power-law
   voltage-current characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report a light driven, non-invasive cell membrane
   perforation technique based on the localized field amplification by a
   nanosecond pulsed laser near gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The
   optoporation phenomena is investigated with pulses generated by a Nd:YAG
   laser for two wavelengths that are either in the visible (532 nm) or
   near infrared (NIR) (1064 nm). Here, the main objective is to compare on
   and off localized surface plasmonic resonance (LSPR) to introduce
   foreign material through the cell membrane using nanosecond laser
   pulses. The membrane permeability of human melanoma cells (MW278) has
   been successfully increased as shown by the intake of a fluorescent dye
   upon irradiation. The viability of this laser driven perforation method
   is evaluated by propidium iodide exclusion as well as MTT assay. Our
   results show that up to 25\% of the cells are perforated with 532 nm
   pulses at 50 mJ/cm(2) and around 30\% of the cells are perforated with
   1064 nm pulses at 1 J/cm(2). With 532 nm pulses, the viability 2 h after
   treatment is 64\% but it increases to 88\% 72 h later. On the other
   hand, the irradiation with 1064 nm pulses leads to an improved 2 h
   viability of 81\% and reaches 98\% after 72 h. Scanning electron
   microscopy images show that the 5 pulses delivered during treatment
   induce changes in the AuNPs size distribution when irradiated by a 532
   nm beam, while this distribution is barely affected when 1064 nm is
   used. (C) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge management from a strategic planning point of view often
   requires having an accurate understanding of a firm's or a nation's
   competences in a given technological discipline. Knowledge maps have
   been used for the purpose of discovering the location, ownership and
   value of intellectual assets. The purpose of this article is to develop
   a new method for assessing national and firm-level competences in a
   given technological discipline. To achieve this goal, we draw a
   competence map by applying agglomerative hierarchical clustering on a
   sample of patents. Considering the top levels of the resulting
   dendrogram, each cluster represents one of the technological branches of
   nanotechnology and its children branches are those that are most
   technologically proximate. We also assign a label to each branch by
   extracting the most relevant words found in each of them. From the
   information about patents inventors' cities, we are able to identify
   where the largest invention communities are located. Finally, we use
   information regarding patent assignees and identify the most productive
   firms. We apply our method to the case of the emerging and
   multidisciplinary Canadian nanotechnology industry.}},

Abstract = {{A kinetic-metabolic model approach describing and simulating Chinese
   hamster ovary (CHO) cell behavior is presented. The model includes
   glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle, respiratory chain,
   redox state and energetic metabolism. Growth kinetic is defined as a
   function of the major precursors for the synthesis of cell building
   blocks. Michaelis-Menten type kinetic is used for metabolic
   intermediates as well as for regulatory functions from energy shuttles
   (ATP/ADP) and cofactors (NAD/H and NADP/H). Model structure and
   parameters were first calibrated using results from bioreactor cultures
   of CHO cells expressing recombinant t-PA. It is shown that the model can
   simulate experimental data for all available experimental data, such as
   extracellular glucose, glutamine, lactate and ammonium concentration
   time profiles, as well as cell energetic state. A sensitivity analysis
   allowed identifying the most sensitive parameters. The model was then
   shown to be readily adaptable for studying the effect of sodium butyrate
   on CHO cells metabolism, where it was applied to the cases with sodium
   butyrate addition either at mid-exponential growth phase (48 h) or at
   the early plateau phase (74 h). In both cases, a global optimization
   routine was used for the simultaneous estimation of the most sensitive
   parameters, while the insensitive parameters were considered as
   constants. Finally, confidence intervals for the estimated parameters
   were calculated. Results presented here further substantiate our
   previous findings that butyrate treatment at mid-exponential phase may
   cause a shift in cellular metabolism toward a sustained and increased
   efficiency of glucose utilization channeled through the TCA cycle.}},

Abstract = {{A modelling approach for volumetric error prediction taking into account
   geometric and servo dynamic errors in a five-axis high-speed machine
   tool is proposed in this paper. Polynomial functions are used to
   represent and then predict the geometric errors. A simple second-order
   transfer function model is used to model and predict the servo dynamic
   error. The servo dynamic errors are added to the axis position geometric
   errors and propagated to the tool and workpiece using matrix
   transformations. The validity of the error integration concept is tested
   for a XYC three-axis motion trajectory. Two experimental setups are
   used. The first experimental test used the KGM grid encoder instrument
   to estimate the parameters of the servo dynamic error models of the X-
   and Y-axes. The second experimental test used a programmed end point
   constraint procedure with measurement of the 3D volumetric positioning
   errors between a point on the tool holder and another fixed to the
   machine table. The tests involve maintaining the nominal coincidence of
   these two points whilst exercising the three axes. These last tests are
   used to estimate the geometric error parameters and also to validate the
   prediction performance of the integrated geometric and dynamic model.
   The result shows the effectiveness of the error integration concept.}},

Title = {{Computation of self-field hysteresis losses in conductors with
   helicoidal structure using a 2D finite element method}},
Journal = {{SUPERCONDUCTOR SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that twisting current-carrying conductors helps to
   reduce their coupling losses. However, the impact of twisting on
   self-field hysteresis losses has not been as extensively investigated as
   that on the reduction of coupling losses. This is mostly because the
   reduction of coupling losses has been an important issue to tackle in
   the past, and it is not possible to consider twisting within the
   classical two-dimensional (2D) approaches for the computation of
   self-field hysteresis losses. Recently, numerical codes considering the
   effect of twisting in continuous symmetries have appeared. For general
   three-dimensional (3D) simulations, one issue is that no robust, widely
   accepted and easy to obtain model for expressing the relationship
   between the current density and the electric field is available. On the
   other hand, we can consider that in these helicoidal structures currents
   flow only along the helicoidal trajectories. This approach allows one to
   use the scalar power-law for superconductor resistivity and makes the
   eddy current approach to a solution of a hysteresis loss problem
   feasible. In this paper we use the finite element method to solve the
   eddy current model in helicoidal structures in 2D domains utilizing the
   helicoidal symmetry. The developed tool uses the full 3D geometry but
   allows discretization which takes advantage of the helicoidal symmetry
   to reduce the computational domain to a 2D one. We utilize in this tool
   the non-linear power law for modelling the resistivity in the
   superconducting regions and study how the self-field losses are
   influenced by the twisting of a 10-filament wire. Additionally, in the
   case of high aspect ratio tapes, we compare the results computed with
   the new tool and a one-dimensional program based on the integral
   equation method and developed for simulating single layer power cables
   made of ReBCO coated conductors. Finally, we discuss modelling issues
   and present open questions related to helicoidal structures and AC-loss
   computations in three dimensions.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Delivery of chitosan to subchondral bone is a novel approach
   for augmented marrow stimulation. We evaluated the effect of 3
   presolidified chitosan-blood implant formulations on osteochondral
   repair progression compared with untreated defects. Design: In N = 5
   adult sheep, six 2-mm diameter Jamshidi biopsy holes were created
   bilaterally in the medial femoral condyle and treated with presolidified
   chitosan-blood implant with fluorescent chitosan tracer (10 kDa, 40 kDa,
   or 150k Da chitosan, left knee) or left to bleed (untreated, right
   knee). Implant residency and osteochondral repair were assessed at 1 day
   (N = 1), 3 weeks (N = 2), or 3 months (N = 2) postoperative using
   fluorescence microscopy, histomorphometry, stereology, and
   micro-computed tomography. Results: Chitosan implants were retained in
   89\% of treated Jamshidi holes up to 3 weeks postoperative. At 3 weeks,
   biopsy sites were variably covered by cartilage flow, and most bone
   holes contained cartilage flow fragments and heterogeneous granulation
   tissues with sparse leukocytes, stromal cells, and occasional adipocytes
   (volume density 1\% to 3\%). After 3 months of repair, most Jamshidi
   bone holes were deeper, remodeling at the edges, filled with angiogenic
   granulation tissue, and lined with variably sized chondrogenic foci
   fused to bone trabeculae or actively repairing bone plate. The 150-kDa
   chitosan implant elicited more subchondral cartilage formation compared
   with 40-kDa chitosan-treated and control defects (P < 0.05, N = 4).
   Treated defects contained more mineralized repair tissue than control
   defects at 3 months (P < 0.05, N = 12). Conclusion: Bone plate-induced
   chondroinduction is an articular cartilage repair mechanism. Jamshidi
   biopsy repair takes longer than 3 months and can be influenced by
   subchondral chitosan-blood implant.}},

Abstract = {{The thermodynamic stability of precipitated phases at the steel-Ni-Mg
   alloy interface during laser brazing of Ni-plated steel to AZ31B
   magnesium sheet using AZ92 magnesium alloy filler wire has been
   evaluated using FactSage thermochemical software. Assuming local
   chemical equilibrium at the interface, the chemical
   activity-temperature-composition relationships of intermetallic
   compounds that might form in the steel-Ni interlayer-AZ92 magnesium
   alloy system in the temperature range of 873 K to 1373 K (600 A degrees
   C to 1100 A degrees C) were estimated using the Equilib module of
   FactSage. The results provided better understanding of the phases that
   might form at the interface of the dissimilar metal joints during the
   laser brazing process. The addition of a Ni interlayer between the steel
   and the Mg brazing alloy was predicted to result in the formation of the
   AlNi, Mg2Ni, and Al3Ni2 intermetallic compounds at the interface,
   depending on the local maximum temperature. This was confirmed
   experimentally by laser brazing of Ni electro-plated steel to AZ31B-H24
   magnesium alloy using AZ92 magnesium alloy filler wire. As predicted,
   the formation of just AlNi and Mg2Ni from a monotectic and eutectic
   reaction, respectively, was observed near the interface.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the underlying relationship between pedestrian injury
   severity outcomes and factors leading to more severe injuries is very
   important in addressing the problem of pedestrian safety. This research
   combines data mining and statistical regression methods to identify the
   main factors associated with the levels of pedestrian injury severity
   outcomes. This work relies on the analysis of two unique pedestrian
   injury severity datasets from New York City, US (2002-2006) and the City
   of Montreal, Canada (2003-2006). General injury severity models were
   estimated for each dataset and for sub-populations obtained through
   clustering analysis. This paper shows how the segmentation of the
   accident datasets helps to better understand the complex relationship
   between the injury severity outcomes and the contribution of geometric,
   built environment and socio-demographic factors. While using the same
   methodology for the two datasets, different techniques were tested.
   Within the New York dataset, a latent class with ordered probit method
   provides the best results. However, for Montreal, K-means with a
   multinomial logit model proves most appropriate. Among other results, it
   was found that pedestrian age, location type, driver age, vehicle type,
   driver alcohol involvement, lighting conditions, and several built
   environment characteristics influence the likelihood of fatal crashes.
   Finally, the research provides recommendations for policy makers,
   traffic engineers, and law enforcement in order to reduce the severity
   of pedestrian-vehicle collisions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{DuPont's vanadium phosphorous oxide catalyst (VPO) deactivated with
   time-on-stream in a commercial butane to maleic anhydride reactor.
   Coincidentally, V5+ phases formed on the surface (based on XPS) -
   principally beta-VOPO4 but also V2O5. This catalyst was reactivated by
   introducing a small amount of a VPO (theoretical P/V atomic ratio =
   0.86) phase. The maleic anhydride production rate of the reactivated
   catalyst was higher by about 60\% compared to the used catalyst.
   n-Butane conversion increased by about 50\% and the selectivity to
   maleic anhydride improved by 15\%. The analyses of the modified catalyst

Abstract = {{The visualization of microstructures including blood vessels with an
   inner overall cross-sectional area below approximately 200 mu m remains
   beyond the capabilities of current clinical imaging modalities. But with
   magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, magnetic entities cause susceptibility
   artifacts in the images by disrupting the homogeneous magnetic field in
   a much larger scale than their actual size. As validated in this paper
   through simulation and in-vitro experiments, these artifacts can serve
   as a source of contrast, enabling microvessels with an inner diameter
   below the spatial resolution of any medical imaging modalities to be
   visualized using a clinical MR scanner. For such experiments,
   micron-sized agglomerations of iron-oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles were
   injected in microchannels with internal diameters of 200 and 50 mu m
   equivalent to a narrower artery or a larger arteriole, and down to a
   smaller arteriole, respectively. The results show the feasibility of the
   proposed method for micro-particle detection and the visualization of
   microvessels using a 1.5 T clinical MR scanner. It was confirmed that
   the method is reproducible and accurate at the sub-pixel level. (C) 2013

Title = {{Multi-parametric MRI as an indirect evaluation tool of the mechanical
   properties of in-vitro cardiac tissues}},
Journal = {{BMC CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{MAR 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Early detection of heart failure is essential to effectively
   reduce related mortality. The quantification of the mechanical
   properties of the myocardium, a primordial indicator of the viability of
   the cardiac tissue, is a key element in patient's care. Despite an
   incremental utilization of multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) for cardiac tissue characteristics and function, the link between
   multi-parametric MRI and the mechanical properties of the heart has not
   been established. We sought to determine the parametric relationship
   between the myocardial mechanical properties and the MR parameters. The
   specific aim was to develop a reproducible evaluative quantitative tool
   of the mechanical properties of cardiac tissue using multi-parametric
   MRI associated to principal component analysis.
   Methods: Samples from porcine hearts were submitted to a
   multi-parametric MRI acquisition followed by a uniaxial tensile test.
   Multi linear regressions were performed between dependent (Young's
   modulus E) and independent (relaxation times T1, T2 and T2{*},
   magnetization transfer ratio MTR, apparent diffusion coefficient ADC and
   fractional anisotropy FA) variables. A principal component analysis was
   used to convert the set of possibly correlated variables into a set of
   linearly uncorrelated variables.
   Results: Values of 46.1 +/- 12.7 MPa for E, 729 +/- 21 ms for T1, 61 +/-
   6 ms for T2, 26 +/- 7 for T2{*}, 35 +/- 5\% for MTRx100, 33.8 +/- 4.7
   for FAx10(-2), and 5.85 +/- 0.21 mm(2)/s for ADCx10(-4) were measured.
   Multi linear regressions showed that only 45\% of E can be explained by
   the MRI parameters. The principal component analysis reduced our seven
   variables to two principal components with a cumulative variability of
   63\%, which increased to 80\% when considering the third principal
   component.
   Conclusions: The proposed multi-parametric MRI protocol associated to
   principal component analysis is a promising tool for the evaluation of
   mechanical properties within the left ventricle in the in vitro porcine
   model. Our in vitro experiments will now allow us focused in vivo
   testing on healthy and infracted hearts in order to determine useful
   quantitative MR-based biomarkers.}},

Abstract = {{Shot peening is a mechanical surface treatment that consists of
   projecting numerous small particles onto a ductile surface. Repeated and
   random hammering leads to compressive residual stresses as well as
   work-hardening near the surface resulting in a potentially significant
   improvement of the fatigue performance. On the other hand, shot peening
   also increases surface roughness and can produce surface damage which
   are detrimental to fatigue properties. Fatigue life prediction models
   have been proposed to predict the combined influence of these factors.
   Most of these models assume that shot peening leads to a uniform
   material state parallel to the surface. The current work investigated
   the heterogeneities present in peened aluminium alloy AA2024-T351 after
   repeated random impacts in terms of residual stresses, work-hardening,
   surface roughness, and damage while also considering the initial
   non-uniformities in the material. Experimental and numerical methods
   were combined to obtain a detailed description of the material state at
   various length scales. The implications of the heterogeneities in terms
   of fatigue performance as well as the potential contributions of
   numerical simulation were also discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We present a novel measurement scheme using a double-clad fiber coupler

   measurement of the optical spectra and power in the cladding modes is
   obtained through the use of a specially designed DCFC spliced to a
   highly reflective FBG written into slightly etched standard
   photosensitive single mode fiber to match the inner cladding diameter of
   the DCFC. The DCFC is made by tapering and fusing two double-clad fibers
   (DCF) together. The device is capable of capturing backward propagating
   low and high order cladding modes simply and efficiently. Also, we
   demonstrate the capability of such a device to measure the surrounding
   refractive index (SRI) with an extremely high sensitivity of 69.769 +/-
   0.035 mu W/RIU and a resolution of 1.433 x 10(-5) x 8 x 10(-9) RIU
   between 1.37 and 1.45 RIU. The device provides a large SRI operating
   range from 1.30 to 1.45 RIU with sufficient discrimination for all

Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{145-161}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the performance of different boundary condition
   strategies for the lattice Boltzmann simulation of industrial viscous
   mixing flows. Three different strategies were chosen from the most
   popular approaches, which are the staircase approaches (bounce-back
   rules), the extrapolation or interpolation methods, and the immersed
   boundary methods. First, the order of convergence of the selected
   methods to impose boundary conditions is verified on the 3D Couette
   flow. This work clearly shows that only the extrapolation method is
   capable of preserving the second order accuracy of the lattice Boltzmann
   method. Second, a highly parallel LBM scheme is used to simulate fluid
   flow with close-clearance mixing systems in the Lagrangian frame of
   reference. The convergence rates obtained with the different boundary
   condition strategies are compared on the basis of two characteristic
   mixing numbers, the power number and the pumping rate. The results agree
   well with experimental data and finite element simulation results, and
   surprisingly enough, the modified bounce back rule provides a reliable
   accuracy despite its simplicity. Finally, the impact of the boundary
   condition strategies on the workload balance and the memory usage is
   analyzed. It appears that only the immersed boundary condition strategy
   modifies the parallel efficiency of the lattice Boltzmann method, yet no
   significant effect is observed on the memory usage. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Uniaxial deformation of amorphous L-polylactic acid films was performed
   at two different temperatures at which thermal degradation was minimal,
   70 degrees C or Tg + 10 and 90 degrees C or Tg + 30. Samples were
   annealed postdeformation for long times (either 15 or 45 min) to
   approach equilibrium conditions. Samples deformed and annealed at 70
   degrees C showed low crystallinity and poor crystalline order or crystal
   size, as determined by wide-angle X-ray diffraction. At 90 degrees C,
   high crystallinity and order parameters were observed. In addition, once
   the oriented chains had crystallized at this temperature, nonoriented
   chains also underwent crystallization, and a small fraction of
   nonordered crystal phase was therefore observed after long annealing
   times. These observations are explained on the basis of different
   morphologies in samples drawn at the two temperatures. (c) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {{The purpose of this article is to help managers early in the design of
   new product families. Based on product structures, sales forecasts, and
   constraints imposed by the marketplace, like quality and cost, the
   proposed method selects the product modules that meet customer
   requirements for the products, while respecting those constraints. The
   proposal includes a single-level module design formulation that
   considers quality and cost simultaneously. The method for testing the
   proposed algorithm is based on a case study of an electromechanical
   assembly device (headlamp). The performance of the algorithm is compared
   to that of the zero module case, where often the constraint problem
   cannot be resolved. The main result is a model and an algorithm that
   optimise quality and cost under the constraints of quality and cost. It
   shows what modules to manufacture, in what quantities, and in which
   products to use them. The output also provides the predicted quality and
   cost, based on improvements made to the modules. To conclude, this
   research enables the joint optimisation of quality and cost by defining
   the modules to be manufactured. It provides input for managers seeking
   modules designed for their supply chain. The algorithm provides key
   input for managing production ramp-up.}},

Abstract = {{It is well-known that optical properties of semiconductor quantum dots
   can be controlled using optical cavities or near fields of localized
   surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) of metallic nanoparticles. In this
   paper we study the optics, energy transfer pathways, and exciton states
   of quantum dots when they are influenced by the near fields associated
   with plasmonic meta-resonances. Such resonances are formed via coherent
   coupling of excitons and LSPRs when the quantum dots are close to
   metallic nanorods and driven by a laser beam. Our results suggest an
   unprecedented sensitivity to the refractive index of the environment,
   causing significant spectral changes in the Forster resonance energy
   transfer from the quantum dots to the nanorods and in exciton transition
   energies. We demonstrate that when a quantum dot-metallic nanorod system
   is close to its plasmonic meta-resonance, we can adjust the refractive
   index to: (i) control the frequency range where the energy transfer from
   the quantum dot to the metallic nanorod is inhibited, (ii) manipulate
   the exciton transition energy shift of the quantum dot, and (iii)
   disengage the quantum dot from the metallic nanoparticle and laser
   field. Our results show that near meta-resonances the spectral forms of
   energy transfer and exciton energy shifts are strongly correlated to
   each other. (C) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{This article proposes a fully forward on-the-fly algorithm to synthesise

   Petri net (TPN) with controllable and uncontrollable transitions and a

   firing intervals of controllable transitions to satisfy the property of
   interest. This algorithm, based on the state class graph method,
   computes on-the-fly the reachable state classes of the TPN while
   collecting progressively firing subintervals to be avoided so that to
   satisfy the property. It does not need to compute controllable
   predecessors and then split state classes as it is the case for other
   approaches based on exploration of state space of the system (backward
   and forward approaches). Moreover, in the category of state-dependent
   controllers based on the restriction of firing intervals, the algorithm,
   proposed here, synthesises maximally permissive controllers.}},

Abstract = {{Besides the spinal deformity, scoliosis modifies notably the general
   appearance of the trunk resulting in trunk rotation, imbalance, and
   asymmetries that constitutes patients' major concern. Existing
   classifications of scoliosis, based on the type of spinal curve as
   depicted on radiographs, are currently used to guide treatment
   strategies. Unfortunately, even though a perfect correction of the
   spinal curve is achieved, some trunk deformities remain, making patients
   dissatisfied with the treatment received. The purpose of this study is
   to identify possible shape patterns of trunk surface deformity
   associated with scoliosis. First, trunk surface is represented by a
   multivariate functional trunk shape descriptor based on 3-D clinical
   measurements computed on cross sections of the trunk. Then, the
   classical formulation of hierarchical clustering is adapted to the case
   of multivariate functional data and applied to a set of 236 trunk
   surface 3-D reconstructions. The highest internal validity is obtained
   when considering 11 clusters that explain up to 65\% of the variance in
   our dataset. Our clustering result shows a concordance with the
   radiographic classification of spinal curves in 68\% of the cases. As
   opposed to radiographic evaluation, the trunk descriptor is 3-D and its
   functional nature offers a compact and elegant description of not only
   the type, but also the severity and extent of the trunk surface
   deformity along the trunk length. In future work, new management
   strategies based on the resulting trunk shape patterns could be thought
   of in order to improve the esthetic outcome after treatment, and thus
   patients satisfaction.}},

Abstract = {{This study assessed the contribution of electron microscopy to the
   characterization of nanoparticles and compared the degree of variability
   in sizes observed within each stage when sampled by two cascade
   impactors: an Electrical Low Pressure Impactor (ELPI) and a
   Micro-Orifice Uniform Deposit Impactor (MOUDI). A TiO2 nanoparticle
   (5nm) suspension was aerosolized in an inhalation chamber. Nanoparticles
   sampled by the impactors were collected on aluminum substrates or TEM
   carbon-coated copper grids using templates, specifically designed in our
   laboratories, for scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM,
   TEM) analysis, respectively. Nanoparticles were characterized using both
   SEM and TEM. Three different types of diameters (inner, outer, and
   circular) were measured by image analysis based on count and volume, for
   each impactor stage. Electron microscopy, especially TEM, is well suited
   for the characterization of nanoparticles. The MOUDI, probably because
   of the rotation of its collection stages, which can minimize the
   resuspension of particles, gave more stable results and smaller
   geometric standard deviations per stage. Our data suggest that the best
   approach to estimate particle size by electron microscopy would rely on
   geometric means of measured circular diameters. Overall, the most
   reliable data were provided by the MOUDI and the TEM sampling technique
   on carbon-coated copper grids for this specific experiment. This study
   indicates interesting findings related to the assessment of impactors
   combined with electron microscopy for nanoparticle characterization. For
   future research, since cascade impactors are extensively used to
   characterize nano-aerosol exposure scenarios, high-performance field
   emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) should also be considered.}},

   nonstationary covariance were compared to the results from the
   stationary covariance for two synthetic models. The nonstationary

Abstract = {{We present in this paper a robust strategy to determine the equilibrium
   state, in the isobaric-isothermal (NPT) ensemble, of complex
   multicomponent systems in which solid solutions presenting
   order/disorder transitions are stable. The algorithm specifically
   designed to construct the first estimate of the phase assemblage
   describing the equilibrium state of the system is presented in detail in
   this work and tested on different binary and ternary systems in which
   solid solutions are modeled using i) the cluster site approximation or
   the cluster variation method in the tetrahedron approximation for both
   the face-centered and body-centered cubic solutions. The performance of
   the sequential quadratic strategy using an exact Newton method and a
   linesearch method, implemented in this work for the specific resolution
   of Gibbs free energy minimization problems, is compared to the one of
   other large-scale optimization software packages: SNOPT, IPOPT, and
   KNITRO. Key subroutines implemented in the strategy to locate local
   minima, and specifically implemented to improve the convergence toward
   targeted local minima, are also presented in this work and highlight the
   robustness of our approach.}},

Abstract = {{Antigorite, the high-temperature (HT) form of serpentinite, is believed
   to play a critical role in various geological processes of subduction
   zones. We have measured P-and S- wave velocities (V-p and V-s),
   anisotropy and shear-wave splitting of 17 serpentinite samples
   containing > 90\% antigorite at pressures up to 650 MPa. The new
   results, combined with data for low-temperature (LT) lizardite and/or
   chrysolite, reveal distinct effects of LT and HT serpentinization on the
   seismic properties of mantle rocks. At 600 MPa, V-p = 5.10 and 6.68
   km/s, V-s = 2.32 and 3.67 km/s, and V-p/V-s = 2.15 and 1.81 for pure LT
   and HT serpentinites, respectively. Above the crack-closure pressure
   (similar to 150 MPa), the velocity ratio of antigorite serpentinites
   displays little dependence on pressure or temperature. Serpentine
   contents within subduction zones and forearc mantle wedges where
   temperature is > 300 degrees C should be at least twice that of previous
   estimates based on LT serpentinization. The presence of seismic
   anisotropy, high-pressure fluids, or partial melt is also needed to
   interpret HT serpentinized mantle with V-p< 6.68 km/s, V-s< 3.67 km/s,
   and V-p/V-s> 1.81. The intrinsic anisotropy of the serpentinites
   (3.8-16.9\% with an average value of 10.5\% for V-p, and 3.6-18.3\% with
   an average value of 10.4\% for V-s) is caused by dislocation
   creep-induced lattice-preferred orientation of antigorite. Three
   distinct patterns of seismic anisotropy correspond to three types of
   antigorite fabrics (S-, L-, and LS-tectonites) formed by three
   categories of strain geometry (i.e., coaxial flattening, coaxial
   constriction, and simple shear), respectively. Our results are thought
   to provide a new explanation for various anisotropic patterns of
   subduction systems observed worldwide.}},

   algorithmic enhancements over the best previously published searching

   optimal-span CDO/S-CDO codes (having order J is an element of \{9\} and
   J. \{10, 11\} respectively), as well as new codes having the shortest

Abstract = {{The hydrodynamics and residence time distribution (RTD) of two
   microreactors based on the split-and-recombination (SAR), and

   was found that the design of the distribution manifolds of the SAR
   mechanism produces an unbalanced flow distribution. For feeding ratios
   different than one, bypassing and recirculation occur within the SAR
   manifolds. For equal flow rates the SAR flow behavior can be accurately
   described by the pure convection model. The manifold used in the
   multilamination microreactor achieves a homogeneous distribution of flow
   and its interdigital mixing structure generates an alternated pattern of
   fluid layers which is maintained for Re 140. After this point the
   ordered arrangement is broken and two large segregated zones are formed.
   In the absence of molecular diffusion both microreactors reach limiting
   values of scale and intensity of segregation that were found to be
   independent of the energy applied to the system. (C) 2012 American

Journal = {{CANADIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{This paper summarizes a detailed geotechnical and geochemical
   characterization program for the Champlain clay deposit in Lachenaie,
   Quebec. Presently, the clay pore water is saline. The main objective of
   the testing program was to study the leaching of the clay saline pore
   water since its deposition. Four issues are discussed in this paper.
   First, the deposit is shown to comprise two distinct clay layers with
   contrasting geotechnical properties. The liquid limit and grain-size
   distribution are the properties that best distinguish the two materials.
   The upper layer is more plastic while the lower one is relatively silty.
   The occurrence of these two layers is shown to be in agreement with some
   recent findings in Quaternary geology. Second, the relatively high
   pre-consolidation pressures of the clay in the Lachenaie area are shown
   to be coherent with an erosion scenario and the elevation of a
   neighbouring bluff previously interpreted as an erosion terrace. Third,
   the relatively constant hydraulic conductivity values obtained from
   permeability tests throughout the deposit are shown to be consistent
   with the variations of liquid limit and void ratio in the two clay
   sublayers. Fourth, the occurrence of sensitive clay pockets (sensitivity
   greater than 50) in this otherwise saline clay body is elucidated.}},

Title = {{Development of a granular normal contact force model based on a
   non-Newtonian liquid filled dashpot}},
Journal = {{POWDER TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{237}},
Pages = {{202-212}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Normal contact force models often suffer from a weak prediction of
   collisions between particles. They regularly fail to predict an adequate
   energy restitution behavior with increasing normal impact velocity. In
   particular, most non-linear models predict a net attraction force
   between two impacting particles near the end of a collision, which is
   unrealistic according to reported results. Such limitations have
   provided the impetus for the development of a normal contact force model
   that better predicts the unfolding of a collision between two particles.
   This model comprises a Hertz elastic force and a dissipative force that
   is evaluated by the motion of a non-Newtonian liquid in a dashpot The
   model parameters are set using experimental restitution data for
   particle/particle and particle/wall contacts. In the current work, the
   measurement of energy restitution for particle/wall collision was
   carried out using several materials over a wide range of impact
   velocities, whereas particle/particle collision data were obtained from
   the literature. Model predictions for microscopic (e.g. particle
   velocity) and macroscopic (e.g. collision time) quantities are presented
   and compared with those from other non-linear models and experimental
   data. The model is observed to adequately,predict the coefficient of
   restitution and to decrease the attraction force at the end of a
   collision. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Multilayer films consisting of a core layer of nylon 6 sandwiched
   between two linear low-density polyethylene layers were produced using a
   semi-industrial cast film extrusion line. The core film was produced at
   different draw ratios from neat nylon and nylon/clay nanocomposite
   resins. The objective was to assess the replacement of neat nylon with a
   nylon/clay nanocomposite for the core layer of a multilayer film.
   Rheological experiments were carried out to characterize the resins and
   study the aspects of the extrusion process. It was observed that clay
   platelets could restrict chain mobility and intensify thermal
   degradation in melt processing; however, that could be balanced to some
   degree with a polycondensation reaction that increases the chain length
   and molecular weight. The crystalline structure of the films was
   examined by X-ray, differential scanning calorimetry, and Fourier
   transform infrared measurements. The clay inclusion favored the -phase
   crystalline phase, which showed a lower melting point. Increasing the
   draw ratio from 6.5 to 13 during the extrusion process did not have a
   significant impact on the orientation of either nylon or nylon/clay in
   the core layer. The physical and mechanical properties of the films were
   studied and discussed. Replacement of nylon with the nylon/clay
   nanocomposite in the core layer did not yield a notable improvement in
   the tensile properties of multilayer films. However, the oxygen barrier
   property was improved by 48\% when the nylon/clay nanocomposite was used
   as the core layer. The haze property was not affected by either changing
   the draw ratio or using the nanocomposite instead of nylon. (c) 2011

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to synthesize initial mean consensus
   behavior of a set of agents from the fundamental optimization principles
   of i) stochastic dynamic games, and ii) optimal control. In the
   stochastic dynamic game model each agent seeks to minimize its
   individual quadratic discounted cost function involving the mean of the
   states of all other agents. In this formulation we derive the limiting
   infinite population mean field equation system and explicitly compute
   its unique solution. The resulting mean field (MF) control strategies
   drive each agent to track the overall population's initial state
   distribution mean, and by applying these decentralized strategies, any
   finite population system reaches mean consensus asymptotically as time
   goes to infinity. Furthermore, these control laws possess an
   epsilon(N)-Nash equilibrium property where epsilon(N) goes to zero as
   the population size goes to infinity. Finally, the analysis is extended
   to the case of random mean field couplings. In the social cooperative
   formulation the basic objective is to minimize a social cost as the sum
   of the individual cost functions containing mean field coupling. In this
   formulation we show that for any individual agent the decentralized mean
   field social (MF Social) control strategy is the same as the mean field
   Nash (MF Nash) equilibrium strategy. Hence
   MF - Nash Controls U-Nash(N) = MF - Social Controls U-Soc(N).
   On the other hand, the solution to the centralized LQR optimal control
   formulation yields the Standard Consensus (SC) algorithm whenever the
   graph representing the corresponding topology of the network is
   Completely Connected (CC). Hence
   Cent. LQR Controls U-Cent(N) = SC - CC Conrols U-SC(N).
   Moreover, a system with centralized control laws reaches consensus on
   the initial state distributionmean as time and population size N go to
   infinity. Hence, asymptotically in time
   MF - Nash Controls U-Nash(N) = MF - Social Controls U-Soc(N) = Cent. LQR
   Controls U-Cent(infinity) = SC - CC Controls U-SC(infinity).
   Finally, the analysis is extended to the long time average (LTA) cost
   functions case.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers deployment problems where a mobile robotic network
   must optimize its configuration in a distributed way in order to
   minimize a steady-state cost function that depends on the spatial
   distribution of certain probabilistic events of interest. Moreover, it
   is assumed that the event location distribution is a priori unknown, and
   can only be progressively inferred from the observation of the actual
   event occurrences. Three classes of problems are discussed in detail:
   coverage control problems, spatial partitioning problems, and dynamic
   vehicle routing problems. In each case, distributed stochastic gradient
   algorithms optimizing the performance objective are presented. The
   stochastic gradient view simplifies and generalizes previously proposed
   solutions, and is applicable to new complex scenarios, such as adaptive
   coverage involving heterogeneous agents. Remarkably, these algorithms
   often take the form of simple distributed rules that could be
   implemented on resource-limited platforms.}},

Title = {{Transient response of a plate with partial constrained viscoelastic

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{68}},
Pages = {{304-312}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper deals with the analytical modeling of a plate with partial
   constrained layer damping (PCLD), to obtain the harmonic and transient
   responses due to an impact. The governing equation is obtained from the
   Lagrange's equations. The stiffness of the viscoelastic core is assumed
   to be complex and frequency dependent. Prony series is used to account
   for core properties. The equation of motion is converted into the
   frequency domain using fast Fourier transform (FFT). Once solved, the
   transverse displacement obtained in the frequency domain is converted to
   the time domain with the inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT). Two
   validations are made; the first is done in harmonic motion by comparing
   the natural frequencies of the plate with PCLD with results available in
   the literature. The second validation is done in transient response by
   comparing displacements to the ones obtained by an experimental set-up.
   Excellent agreement is noted between results. Once the model is
   validated, graphs of the transient response are presented and discussed.

Abstract = {{We here report the development of a new generation of enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that takes advantage of a low-fouling
   carboxymethylated dextran (CMD) layer chemically grafted on ELISA wells.
   In our approach, the overnight capture antibody adsorption step found in
   classical ELISA was replaced by a covalent attachment step to the CMD
   layer completed in 15 min. As a model, the potential of our approach was
   highlighted using commercially available anti-human epidermal growth
   factor (EGF) antibodies to quantify EGF present in various samples. Of
   interest, the grafted CMD layer was found to be as efficient as the
   commonly used bovine serum albumine (BSA) to reduce non-specific
   adsorption, thus eliminating the need of a time-consuming BSA blocking
   step normally required in classical ELISA. Our results demonstrated
   similar specificity, affinity, and intra- and inter-assay variations
   regardless of the diluent used in the assay (BSA-based diluent or
   protein-free buffer solution) when compared to standard ELISA. Finally,
   accuracy and precision of the CMD-based ELISA were verified by a spike
   and recovery test. Dilutions of recombinant human EGF in serum from
   healthy human volunteers showed almost-perfect linearity and mean
   recovery rates ranging between 90 and 110\%. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Pulp and paper mills receive much attention from environmentalist and

   aiming for simultaneous water and energy saving for BSWS in the pulp and
   paper mills. A mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model has
   been developed to optimize the water network design. The synthesized
   water network results in significant reduction in energy and water

   for the variation of heat extraction rates among boreholes due to
   thermal interaction among boreholes and for the buried depth to borehole
   height ratio (D/H) which was not included in Eskilson's original work.
   The new method is based on the analytical finite line source and the
   solution is not limited to regular borehole spacing.
   Borehole-to-borehole and group-to-borehole response factors are
   evaluated and then temporal super-position of heat extraction rates is
   applied in the Laplace domain. The heat extraction rates obtained with
   the proposed method showed good agreement with Eskilson's numerical
   model. The differences observed can be explained by the fact that two
   different boundary conditions are used at the borehole wall. However,
   for small simulation times, the differences are small and the response
   factors are almost identical for up to 10 and 6 years for 3 x 2 and 10 x
   10 bore fields, respectively. For large bore fields, thermal
   interactions among boreholes become important and the differences
   observed between the proposed model and the g-function increase. For
   instance, the g-function of a 10 x 10 bore field obtained with the
   proposed method overestimates the g-function by 32\% at steady-state.
   Finally, the effect of the buried depth (D) is examined using the
   proposed method. It is shown that the response factor of a 5 m borehole
   buried at depths of 1 and 3 m differ by 19\%. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

   order-namely, half-compared to that of previously reported synthesis
   techniques for linear-phase filters. Once it has been constructed, the
   transfer function is transferred into coupling matrices that can be
   implemented in arbitrary cross-coupled-resonator technologies. Several

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A new algorithm to optimize stope design for the sublevel stoping mining
   method is described. The model is based on a cylindrical coordinate
   defined around the initial vertical raise. Geotechnical constraints on
   hanging wall and footwall slopes are translated as precedence relations
   between blocks in the cylindrical coordinate system. Two control
   parameters with clear engineering meaning are defined to further
   constrain the solution: (a) the maximum distance of a block from the
   raise and (b) the horizontal width required to bring the farthest block
   to the raise. The graph obtained is completed by the addition of a
   source and a sink node allowing to transform the optimization program to
   a problem of maximum flow over the graph. The (conditional) optimal
   stope corresponding to the current raise location and height is
   obtained. The best location and height for the raise are determined by
   global optimization. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated with
   three simple synthetic deposits and one real deposit. Comparison is made
   with the floating stope technique. The results show that the algorithm
   effectively meets the geotechnical constraints and control parameters,
   and produce realistic optimal stope for engineering use. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{This paper presents a methodology for an optimal design of interference
   fit subjected to fatigue loads. Optimization consists in finding a
   trade-off between mass and competing safety factors at hub and shaft
   contact zone as well as in shaft fillet. Developing an effective
   calculation method for fatigue strength of an interference fitted
   assembly using the finite element method is one of the main steps of the
   procedure. Meanwhile, coupling the finite elements model of interference
   fit with an optimization algorithm is not adequate considering the
   computing time and the significant number of calculations necessary to
   portrait the assembly behavior. Therefore, a sequential approximate
   multi-objective optimization algorithm (SAMOO) is presented. The method
   involves Design Of Experiments (DOE), interpolation with kriging
   functions, and multi-objective optimization. Preliminary study of
   parameter variance, and advanced post-processing of multi-objective
   optimization, provide engineers with valuable information for
   identifying an optimal design of interference fit assembly using fewer

Abstract = {{The authors present a method for the fast and efficient measurement of
   volumes of reciprocal space by x-ray diffraction using linear and area
   detectors. The goal of this technique is to obtain a complete overview
   of the reciprocal space to detect and characterize the nature and
   orientation of all the phases present. They first explain the detailed
   procedures and scan strategies required for transforming raw scattering
   data into three-dimensional maps of reciprocal space and present a
   complete open-source software package for advanced data processing,
   analysis, and visualization. Several case studies, chosen to highlight
   the overall capabilities of the technique, are then introduced. First,
   thermal diffuse scattering from a monocrystalline Si substrate is
   characterized by the presence of lines linking diffraction peaks in
   reciprocal space. Second, a detailed investigation of texture in
   multiphase thin layers permits us to reveal the unambiguous presence of
   fiber, axiotaxial, and epitaxial components in oriented films. The
   visualization of a significant fraction of reciprocal space has allowed
   us to identify an unexpected metastable phase, which could not be
   deduced from measurements carried out in the Bragg-Brentano geometry.
   The technique is then used to study planar defects in nickel silicides
   formed by solid-state reactions and micro twins in a GaP matrix
   containing coherent MnP precipitates. Overall, the authors show that the
   systematic acquisition of significant volumes of reciprocal space
   permits us to observe behaviors that might otherwise remain undetected
   when analyses are restricted to typical measurement scans. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Direct chlorination of toxic cyanobacteria cells can occur at various
   stages of treatment. The objectives of this work are to determine and
   model the extent of Microcystis aeruginosa cells lysis, toxins and
   organic compounds release and oxidation, and quantify the subsequent
   disinfection by-products formation. Chlorine exposure (CT) values of 296
   and 100 mg min/L were required to obtain 76\% cell lysis and oxidation
   of released cell-bound toxins at levels below the provisional World
   Health Organisation guideline value (1 mu g/L MC-LR). Toxin oxidation
   rates were similar or faster than cell lysis rates in ultrapure water.
   This work presents much needed unit M. aeruginosa cellular chlorine
   demand (5.6 +/- 0.2 pgCl(2)/cell) which could be used to adjust the
   chlorination capacity to satisfy the total chlorine demand associated
   with the presence of cells. Furthermore, a novel successive reaction
   kinetics model is developed using the kinetics of the chlorine reaction
   with cyanobacterial cells and cell-bound toxins. Chlorination of dense
   cell suspensions (500,000 cells/mL) in ultrapure water at CT up to 3051
   mg min/L resulted in modest concentrations of trihalomethanes (13 mu
   g/L) and haloacetic acids (below detection limit). (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The Marangoni flows in a shallow cavity subject to uniform heat fluxes
   on all sides are investigated. A power law model is used to characterize
   the non-Newtonian fluid behavior of the fluid. The system with an
   underformable free upper surface is assumed to be under a zero gravity
   environment. The governing parameters for the problem are the thermal
   Marangoni number Ma, power-law index n, Prandtl number Pr and cavity
   aspect ratio aspect ratio A. An analytical solution, valid for an
   infinite layer (A >> 1), is derived on the basis of the parallel flow
   approximation. For the case of a layer heated from the bottom it is
   demonstrated that, for shear-thinning fluids (n < 1), the onset of
   convection is subcritical. For shear thickening fluids (n > 1),
   convection is found to occur at a supercritical Rayleigh equal to zero.
   For the case of a layer heated from all sides it is shown that multiple
   steady state solutions are possible, some of which are unstable. The
   effects of the non-Newtonian behavior on the fluid flow, temperature
   field and heat transfer are discussed. A good agreement is found between
   the analytical predictions and the numerical results obtained by solving
   the full governing equations. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights
