Abstract = {{The synergistic effect of organo-modified montmorillonite (Nanomer I28E
   and Cloisite 20A) and metal hydroxides (magnesium hydroxide MH and
   alumina trihydrate ATH) as flame retardants in LDPE/EVA nanocomposites
   compatibilized with amino alcohol grafted polyethylene (PEgDMAE) was
   studied. Morphological characterization of nanocomposites was carried
   out by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning transmission
   electron microscopy (STEM). Flame-retardant properties of nanocomposites
   were evaluated by the UL-94 horizontal burning and cone calorimeter
   tests and limiting oxygen index (LOI). Thermal degradation behavior was
   analyzed with a Fourier transform infrared coupled with the
   thermogravimetric analyzer (TG-FTIR). The XRD analysis showed a
   displacement of the d(001) plane characteristic peak of clay to lower
   angles, which indicates an intercalated exfoliated morphology. From STEM
   images it was observed a good dispersion of flame retardants (MH and
   ATH) throughout the polymer matrix which was reflected in
   flame-retardant properties. TG-FTIR showed a better thermal stability of
   nanocomposites and the gases evolved during combustion showed an
   important reduction. Based on thermal stability and thermal degradation
   results, the flame-retardant mechanism of LDPE/PEgDMAE/EVA/Clay/MH
   nanocomposites was proposed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hierarchically porous polymers with controllable pore size were
   generated through a novel polymer blending strategy in an A/B/C-B-C
   ternary blend system. Polylactide/high-density
   polyethylene/poly(styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene) triblock copolymer
   (PLA/HDPE/SEBS) was used as a model system to demonstrate this
   technique. During melt blending, the SEBS was driven into the HDPE phase
   owing to the presence of the PE block in the copolymer. With proper
   volume fractions of PLA/HDPE/SEBS (e.g., 50/25/25), a bi-modal, dual
   co-continuous morphology was obtained and hierarchically porous
   polymeric materials were further generated by selectively removing the
   PLA and SEBS phases. Annealing and compositional variation were further
   employed to control the pore size and it is shown that the length scales
   of the two co-continuous morphologies can be controlled independently.

Abstract = {{This study investigates the role of polymer chain mobility, through the
   addition of a plasticizer, N-butylbenzene sulfonamide (BBSA), on the
   overall blending dynamics and interfacial copolymer chain formation in
   the reactive blending of brominated poly(isobutylene-co-p-methylstyrene)
   (BIMSM) and polyamide (PA). Compared to a non-reactive
   poly(isobutylene-co-p-methylstyrene) (IMSM)/PA blend, the reactive
   BIMSM/PA blend demonstrates a rapid, order of magnitude increase in
   viscosity, and attains a plateau viscosity at higher temperatures. The
   addition of a BBSA plasticizer (5-10 wt\%) surprisingly increases the
   viscosity even further, suggesting an enhancement in interfacial
   reaction due to increased chain mobility. It is also found to increase
   the level of grafting from about 46 to 57\% and has a significant
   influence on the morphology of the blend system. It is shown that the
   reactive grafting has an onset at lower temperatures for the blend
   system with 10 and 43\% plasticizer. The morphologies of the blends with
   5-10\% plasticizer have a more uniform distribution (d(v)/d(n)) with a
   reduced d(v) for the dispersed BIMSM particles. At 43 wt\% plasticizer
   the blends show an increased phase size resulting from the significantly
   enhanced phase coalescence. These results indicate that enhanced chain
   mobility through plasticizer usage can impact interfacial
   compatibilization and phase coalescence and that a threshold level of
   5-10 wt\% plasticizer provides an optimum level of chain mobility for
   this reactive blending system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The effects of nanoclay (Cloisite 30B) on the foamability of polylactide
   (PLA) were investigated in continuous extrusion foaming using
   supercritical CO2 as the blowing agent. PLA samples containing 0-5 wt\%
   of nanoclay were prepared. The X-ray diffraction and transmission
   electron microscopy images showed a high degree of exfoliation of clay
   nanoparticles within PLA. A single-screw tandem extruder was used to
   produce foams with 5 wt\% and 9 wt\% supercritical CO2. The
   crystallization behavior of the samples was analyzed using regular and
   high-pressure differential scanning calorimeters and using a rotational
   rheometer under small amplitude oscillatory shearing. In the presence of
   dissolved CO2, clay, and shear action, the PLA crystallization kinetics
   was significantly enhanced. The foamed results showed that both the cell
   density and the expansion ratio were greatly promoted with increased
   clay content and the dissolved CO2, as well as by the possibly nucleated
   crystals. By further use of Cloisite 20A nanoclay particles with poor
   disperse-ability in PLA, we also proved that a high degree of dispersion
   significantly promoted the cell density and the expansion ratio of the
   PLA nanocomposites. Further, by varying the temperature profile within
   second extruder of the tandem-line, it was confirmed that the more rapid
   crystallization along the second extruder was responsible for the
   enhanced cell density and expansion ratio. The final crystallinity of
   the foamed samples was also enhanced at higher expansion ratios due to
   the strain induced crystallization. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a digital signal processor (DSP) capable of
   monitoring the urinary bladder volume through afferent neural pathways.
   The DSP carries out real-time detection and can discriminate
   extracellular action potentials, also known as on-the-fly spike sorting.
   Next, the DSP performs a decoding method to estimate either three
   qualitative levels of fullness or the bladder volume value, depending on
   the selected output mode. The proposed DSP was tested using both
   realistic synthetic signals with a known ground-truth, and real signals
   from bladder afferent nerves recorded during acute experiments with
   animal models. The spike sorting processing circuit yielded an average
   accuracy of 92\% using signals with highly correlated spike waveforms
   and low signal-to-noise ratios. The volume estimation circuits, tested
   with real signals, reproduced accuracies achieved by offline simulations
   in Matlab, i.e., 94\% and 97\% for quantitative and qualitative
   estimations, respectively. To assess feasibility, the DSP was deployed
   in the Actel FPGA Igloo AGL1000V2, which showed a power consumption of
   0.5 mW and a latency of 2.1 ms at a 333 kHz core frequency. These
   performance results demonstrate that an implantable bladder sensor that
   perform the detection, discrimination and decoding of afferent neural
   activity is feasible.}},

Abstract = {{In the quest to reduce risk of thrombosis in vascular grafts, it is
   essential to provide a surface with morphological and mechanical
   properties close to those of the extracellular matrix beneath the
   luminal endothelium, and to favor the growth of a confluent, stable
   monolayer of endothelial cells. This is accomplished here by combining
   electrospun poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) mats with an amine-rich
   thin plasma-polymerized coating, designated ``L-PPE:N.'' Its deposition
   does not modify the open, highly porous mats and leads only to small
   changes in mechanical properties. L-PPE:N significantly improves the
   adhesion and growth of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC)
   and their resistance to flow-induced shear stress. These properties
   favor the formation of desired confluent HUVEC monolayers on the topmost
   surface, unlike conventional vascular grafts (ePTFE or woven PET), where
   cells migrate inside the material. This combination is therefore highly
   advantageous for the pre-endothelialization of the luminal side of
   small-diameter vascular prostheses.}},

Abstract = {{Earthfill dams, and even all dams, are designed to withstand different
   factors ( meteorological, seismic, and human), which might be

   and the possibilities of failure exist. With a view to optimize the
   safety of downstream areas, dam failures by overtopping can be studied
   from a probabilistic point of view, in order to go further than a simple
   failure - non failure evaluation. Probability calculation of the
   failure, mainly with flood studies, is the first step. Then, in order to
   improve the prediction of the failure, the failure hydrograph is

Title = {{Seasonal Thermal Cracking of Concrete Dams in Northern Regions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PERFORMANCE OF CONSTRUCTED FACILITIES}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In several northern regions around the world, concrete dams are
   subjected to severe seasonal temperature variations, with up to 75
   degrees C changes from summer to winter. Those variations contribute to
   the degradation of the stiffness, strength, and durability of concrete
   dams. Thermal stresses and related concrete cracking also need to be
   evaluated to ensure the structural stability of the dam and to define
   the initial conditions for unusual or extreme load combinations, such as
   floods and earthquakes. This paper presents finite-element modeling
   procedures for assessing the thermomechanical behaviors of concrete
   dams. The stress relaxation and mechanical properties that depend on the
   temperature of the concrete are first investigated by considering the
   thermomechanical responses of simple notched beam models. Heat transfer
   and thermomechanical analyses are then presented for a 31-m concrete
   gravity dam and a 214-m multiple arch dam located in Canada. It is shown
   that temperature-dependent material properties do not significantly
   affect the structural response of the dam. Oblique cracks present on the
   downstream face of the multiple arch dam are successfully reproduced by
   the proposed numerical model. Modeling of the related cracked arch
   flexibility using equivalent linear continuum concrete constitutive
   models is also discussed. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

   of the PWR sensor to simultaneously operate in both TM and TE modes is
   used to decouple the background index variations (bulk effects) from the

Title = {{Effect of long-term orthotic treatment on gait biomechanics in
   adolescent idiopathic scoliosis}},
Journal = {{SPINE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1510-1519}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND CONTEXT: A previous study showed subtle biomechanical changes
   in the gait of unbraced adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients
   such as a reduction of pelvic, hip, knee, and ankle displacements.
   However, lumbopelvic muscles' timing activity was bilaterally increased
   during gait and correlated to excessive oxygen consumption as compared
   with healthy subjects. Usually, a brace, when indicated, is worn
   strictly for 22 hours every day in skeletally immature idiopathic
   scoliotic girls. To our knowledge, no study has assessed the long-term
   brace effect (6 months) on functional activities such as level walking.
   PURPOSE: To assess the stiffening effects of 6 months' brace wearing on
   instrumented gait analysis in girls with thoracolumbar/lumbar adolescent
   idiopathic scoliosis.
   STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Clinical prospective study. PATIENT SAMPLE:
   Thirteen girls diagnosed as progressive adolescent idiopathic scoliosis
   with left thoracolumbar/lumbar curves (curves ranging 25 degrees-40
   degrees).
   OUTCOME MEASURES: All patients underwent a radiographic and instrumented
   gait analysis, including assessment of kinematics, mechanics,
   electromyography (EMG), and energetics of walking.
   METHODS: The scoliotic girls were prospectively studied at S1 (before
   bracing) and 6 months later at S2 (out-brace: treatment effect). The
   gait parameters were compared with those of 13 matched healthy girls. A
   t paired test was conducted to evaluate the effect of the 6-month
   orthotic treatment in AIS girls. Student t test was performed to compare
   the scoliotic group at S2 and the healthy subjects to identify if the
   observed changes in gait parameters meant improvement or worsening of
   gait.
   RESULTS: After 6 months of orthotic treatment in AIS,
   thoracolumbar/lumbar curves and apical rotation remained reduced by 25\%
   and 61\%, respectively. During gait, frontal pelvis and hip motions were
   significantly increased. Muscular mechanical work increased becoming
   closer but still different as compared with healthy subjects. Bilateral
   lumbopelvic muscles were almost 40\% more active in AIS at S1 compared
   with healthy subjects and did not change at S2 except for the erector
   spinae muscles EMG activity, which decreased significantly. Energy cost
   exceeded by 30\% in AIS at S1 compared with healthy subjects and did not
   change at 6 months' follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: After 6 months of orthotic treatment, in an out-brace
   situation, the main structural thoracolumbar/lumbar curve remained
   partly corrected. Frontal pelvis and hip motion increased, contributing
   to an improvement of muscular mechanical work during walking. EMG
   activity duration of lumbopelvic muscles did not change except for the
   erector spinae muscles, which was decreased but without any beneficial
   change in the energy cost of walking. In summary, brace treatment, after
   6 months, did not significantly influence the gait variables in AIS
   girls deleteriously, but did not reduce the excessive energy cost, which
   was 30\% above the values of normal adolescents. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{The removal of free fatty acids (FFA) in vegetable oils is an important
   pretreatment in the production of biodiesel, in particular, when the
   starting materials are low-cost feedstocks. Heterogeneously catalyzed
   esterification with methanol transforms FFA in fatty acid methyl ester
   (FAME), decreasing the oil acidity and producing biodiesel
   simultaneously. The equilibrium of this reaction shifts toward the
   desired product when increasing the methanol content, but at the same
   time, a double-liquid-phase system forms when the methanol content is
   higher than 6-8 wt \%. The presence of a double liquid phase can be an
   important drawback in the reactor. A detailed study about the
   optimization of the methanol quantity is presented, both using a batch
   and a packed-bed reactor (PBR) at different temperatures (between 60 and
   105 degrees C) using Amberlyst 46 (ion-exchange resin) as the
   heterogeneous catalyst. The deacidification of sunflower oil in a
   monophasic liquid system leads to satisfactory results (final FFA lower
   than 0.5 wt \%) for both of the reactors. The experimental results
   demonstrate that the excess of methanol is not convenient in terms of
   both slower reaction rates and mass of reactant used. The stability of
   Amberlyst 46 in the PBR was positively verified after 600 h of work.}},

   time delay extraction}},

Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Fluidelastic instability is a key issue in steam generator tube bundles
   subjected to cross-flow. The extension to two-phase flow of the existing
   theoretical models, developed and tested mostly for single phase flow,
   is investigated in this paper. The time delay is one of the key
   parameter for modeling fluidelastic instability, especially the damping
   controlled mechanism. The direct measurement of the time delay between
   the tube motion and the fluid force faces certain difficulties in
   two-phase flow since the high turbulence due to the interaction of the
   two components of the flow may increase the randomness of the measured
   force. To overcome this difficulty, an innovative method for extracting
   the time delay inherent to the quasi-steady model for fluidelastic
   instability is proposed in this study.
   Firstly, experimental measurements of unsteady and quasi-static fluid
   forces (in the lift direction) acting on a tube subjected to air water
   two-phase flow were conducted. The unsteady fluid forces were measured
   by exciting the tube using a linear motor. These forces were measured
   for a wide range of void fractions, flow velocities and excitation
   frequencies. The experimental results showed that the unsteady fluid
   forces could be represented as single valued function of the reduced
   flow velocity. It was also found that for a given frequency, the
   unsteady fluid force phase was weakly dependent on the void fraction for
   the range of flow velocities considered.
   The time delay was determined by equating the unsteady fluid forces with
   the quasi-steady forces. The results given by this innovative method of
   measuring the time delay in two-phase flow were consistent with
   theoretical expectations. The time delay could be expressed as a linear
   function of the convection time and the time delay parameter was
   determined for void fractions ranging from 60\% to 90\%. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The extension of the existing theoretical models for fluidelastic
   instability to two-phase flow is investigated in this paper. Experiments
   were conducted on a single flexible tube in a rotated triangular tube
   array subjected to air-water cross-flow. The flow independent damping,
   added mass and critical velocity for fluidelastic instability were
   measured. A new formulation of the added mass as a function of the void
   fraction is proposed. This formulation takes into consideration the
   reduction of the void fraction around the tubes in a rotated triangular
   tube array and yields better agreement with the experimental data
   compared to previous formulations.
   The quasi-steady and unsteady models were also used to compute the
   critical velocity for fluidelastic instability. The results of the
   unsteady model were in very good agreement with the experimental data
   and subsequently were used to assess the validity of the quasi-steady
   model over a wider range of mass-damping parameter. The predictions of
   the quasi-steady model were found to be in good agreement with the
   experimental data for high void fractions. The use of the time delay
   parameter, experimentally determined in the first part of this paper,
   was found to significantly improve the results, especially for high void
   fractions. However, the limitation of the current setup did not allow
   measurements at high values of the reduced flow velocity (U/fD) for low
   void fractions. Nevertheless, this study confirms the validity of the
   measured time delay parameter and validates the quasi-steady model for
   the range of void fraction considered (60\%-90\%). (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Large-amplitude vibrations of liquid-filled cantilevered (clamped-free)
   circular cylindrical tanks are studied theoretically for the first time.
   The influence of liquid height and initial geometric imperfections is
   investigated in detail. The tank motions are described by a nonlinear
   model based on Flugge's shell theory, and the liquid motions are
   modelled by means of linearized potential flow theory. Equations of
   motion are obtained using the extended Hamilton's principle and are
   discretized by expanding the solution with trigonometric functions in
   the circumferential direction and the cantilevered beam eigenfunctions
   in the axial direction. The geometric boundary conditions are satisfied
   exactly, while the natural ones are satisfied in an energy minimization
   sense. The system is integrated numerically by employing the appropriate
   modal composition of the solution to guarantee convergence. Results are
   presented in the form of frequency-response curves in the neighbourhood
   of the lowest natural frequency. It is found that the response may be of
   softening or hardening type, depending on the liquid height and the

Abstract = {{An melt-mixing process has been used to prepare Poly(ethylene
   terephthalate) (PET)/clay nanocomposites with high degree of clay
   delamination. In this method, steam was fed into a twin-screw extruder
   (TSE) to reduce the PET molecular weight and to facilitate their
   diffusion into the gallery spacing of organoclays. Subsequently, the
   molecular weight (MW) reduction of the PET matrix due to hydrolysis by
   water was compensated by solid-state polymerization (SSP). The effect of
   the thermodynamic compatibility of PET and organoclays on the exfoliated
   microstructure of the nanocomposites was also examined by using three
   different nanoclays. The dispersion of Cloisite 30B (C30B) in PET was
   found to be better than that of Nanomer I.28E (I28E) and Cloisite Na+.
   The effect of feeding rate and consequently residence time on the
   properties of PET nanocomposites was also investigated. The results
   reveal more delamination of organoclay platelets in PET-C30B
   nanocomposites processed at low feeding rate compared to those processed
   at high feeding rate. Enhanced mechanical and barrier properties were
   observed in PET nanocomposites after SSP compared to the nanocomposites
   prepared by conventional meltmixing. (C) 2013 Society of Plastics

Abstract = {{Avionics Full Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX) is a standard proposed to
   implement deterministic networks by providing predictable performance
   guarantees. The determinism is enforced through the concept of Virtual
   Link, which defines a logical unidirectional connection between end
   systems. Although an upper bounded end-to-end delay can be obtained
   using analysis based on, e. g., network calculus, frame arrival
   uncertainty in destination End-System is a source of nondeterminism that
   introduces a problem with respect to real-time fault detection. In this
   paper, a mechanism based on frame insertion is proposed to enhance the
   determinism of frame arrival within AFDX networks. In order to mitigate
   network load increase due to frame insertion, a Sub-Virtual Link
   aggregation strategy, formulated as a multiobjective optimization
   problem, is introduced. In addition, a brute force algorithm, a greedy
   algorithm, and a greedy algorithm with preprocessing have been developed
   to find solutions to the optimization problem. Experiments are carried
   out and the obtained results confirm the validity and applicability of
   the developed approaches.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, it will be shown that morphologically tailored
   tricontinuous ternary blends, comprising polybutylene succinate (PBS),
   polylactic acid (PLA), and poly (butylene
   adipate-co-terephthalate)(PBAT), can generate new materials with
   excellent properties. Detailed morphological analysis is used to
   establish that all three phases in the ternary 33\%PBS/33\%PLA/33\%PBAT
   blend morphology are highly continuous with a phase structure dominated
   by complete wetting dynamics. PBS is shown to situate itself between PLA
   and PBAT. This melt processed, self-assembled, multiple percolated,
   blend possesses a high elongation at break (567\%), high Young's modulus
   (1130 MPa), high impact strength (271 J/m), and a storage modulus about
   50\% higher than pure PBS at room temperature. None of the neat
   materials demonstrate this combination of high properties and the
   synergy derives from the tricontinuous structure of the system. The
   ternary nature of the blend allows for a modulation of the crystallinity
   behavior as examined by differential scanning calorimeter and X-ray

Abstract = {{Objective: Children with a neuromuscular disease are prone to early
   muscular fatigue. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the
   effects of fatigue induced by a walking exercise on the strength,
   postural control, and gait of children with a neuromuscular disease.
   Design: Maximal isometric knee strength (extension and flexion), quiet
   standing postural control, and gait were evaluated in 12 children (8.8
   {[}1.4] yrs) with a neuromuscular disease before and after a walking
   exercise. The participants were asked to stop walking when they
   considered themselves ``very fatigued.{''}
   Results: After the exercise-induced fatigue, a significant increase in
   range of motion in pelvis obliquity, hip abduction and adduction, and
   ankle flexion and extension during gait was reported along with an
   increase in stride length variability. Fatigue also reduced the knee
   flexor strength and had a detrimental effect on postural control.
   Conclusions: Fatigue affects the strength, postural control, and gait of
   children with a neuromuscular disease and could notably increase the
   risks of falling and the occurrence of serious injuries.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a novel approach for automated intrusion response systems to
   assess the value of the loss that could be suffered by a compromised
   resource. A risk assessment component of the approach measures the risk
   impact and is tightly integrated with our response system component.
   When the total risk impact exceeds a certain threshold, the response
   selection mechanism applies one or more responses. A multi-level
   response selection mechanism is proposed to gauge the intrusion damage
   (attack progress) relative to the response impact. This model proposes a
   feedback mechanism, which measures the response goodness and helps
   indicate the new risk level following application of the response(s).
   Not only does our proposed model constitutes a novel online mechanism
   for response activation and deactivation based on the online risk
   impact, it also addresses the factors inherent in assessing risk and
   calculating response effectiveness that are more complex in terms of
   detail. We have designed a sophisticated multi-step attack to penetrate
   Web servers, as well as to acquire root privilege. Our simulation
   results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed model and confirm the
   feasibility of the approach in real time. At the end of paper, we
   discuss the various ways in which an attacker might succeed in
   completely bypassing our response system.}},

Title = {{CIGI2011: A heuristic method for resource-constrained project scheduling

Abstract = {{The overlapping of activities is a common practice to accelerate the
   execution of engineering projects. This technique consists in executing
   in parallel two activities, normally executed in a sequential way, by
   allowing the downstream activity to start before the end of the upstream
   activity based on preliminary information. In this paper, we propose a
   constructive heuristic for the resource-constrained project scheduling
   problem with overlapping modes (RCPSP-OM). Given a set of activities to
   execute, the RCPSP-OM consists in determining the order of execution in
   time of a set of activities so as to minimize the total project
   duration, while respecting precedence relations, resource constraints
   and overlapping possibilities. The heuristic implies that rework tasks
   related to overlapping are added to downstream activities and that the
   consumption of the resources is constant throughout the execution of the
   project (including rework). The method also considers that the possible
   overlapping modes for every couple of activities and the duration of
   rework tasks associated with every mode are known in advance. Results
   show that, when the objective consists in minimizing the project
   duration, the consideration of the costs associated to activity
   overlapping allows to significantly reducing the cost of reworks. On the
   other hand, when the objective consists in maximizing the gains related
   to the project execution, the search for the best trade-off between
   acceleration and increase of project costs enables to avoid losses.}},

Abstract = {{The Pt-doped LiFePO4/C cathode material was synthesized for the first
   time. LiFePO4 and LiFe0.96Pt0.04PO4 composites were synthesized using a
   hydrothermal method. The physical and chemical properties of samples
   were characterized by XRD, XPS, SEM and BET. For electrochemical
   property investigation, the samples were mixed with sucrose as carbon
   source, and calcined at 700 degrees C for 5 h. The XRD results showed
   that the platinum has been successfully doped into LiFePO4 bulk
   structure. The XPS results indicated that platinum doping does not
   change the chemical state of Fe (II). The SEM and BET results showed
   that platinum doping reduces the size of the particles. The
   electrochemical characterization of the electrodes using discharge
   capacity, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy (EIS) showed that the Li-ion cell based on
   LiFe0.96Pt0.04PO4/C electrode exhibited better charge/discharge
   performance than that of LiFePO4/C sample. The LiFe0.96Pt0.04PO4/C based
   cell delivered the specific capacity of 168, 162, 135, 120 and 102 mAh

Abstract = {{This paper formulates an optimal design model for assembly/disassembly

   The buffers are also characterized by their total cost of ownership

Pages = {{135-150}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a rigorous and exhaustive evaluation of the
   analytical homogenization models accuracy for the case of randomly
   distributed and oriented ellipsoidal fibers reinforced composites.
   Artificial random microstructures were generated using a molecular
   dynamics (MD) algorithm. Numerical effective properties were computed
   using a Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) based technique. The numerical
   predictions were,compared to those of the analytical models for a wide
   range of phases mechanical properties, fibers volume fractions and
   aspect ratios. The validation campaign involved a rigorous
   Representative Volume Element (RVE) determination process and
   approximately, 66,000 simulations were performed. The results show that
   the analytical models accuracy is more sensitive to the mechanical
   properties contrasts than to the fibers volume fraction and aspect
   ratio. Among all the studied models, Lielens' model remains the most
   accurate, especially for high contrasts and volume fractions. For high
   aspect ratio fibers, Lielens's model and Beveniste's interpretation of
   the Mori-Tanaka model provide similar estimates, especially when
   predicting the effective shear modulus. In this case, the latter could
   be an alternative to Lielens' model, especially for composites where the
   fibers are not completely stiffer than the matrix. All conclusions of
   this study apply to both prolate and oblate ellipsoidal fibers. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{In order to evaluate the performance of a novel batch fluidized
   microreactor, called ``the Jiggle Bed Reactor'', in producing reliable
   and reproducible data and its functionality in relation to changes in
   operating parameters, non-catalytic and catalytic steam reforming of a
   model compound (acetic acid) was investigated. Silica sand was used as
   the bed material for non-catalytic tests and a commercial steam
   reforming catalyst was used for the catalytic tests. Testing parameters
   included temperatures between 650 degrees C and 750 degrees C, reaction
   times between 10 s and 90 s and molar steam to carbon ratio ( S/C) equal
   to 0, 3 and 6. Such long reactions times were selected to investigate
   extend of conversion of acetic acid and yield of product gases in the
   absence of catalyst. Atmospheric pressure was used in all experiments.
   Analysis of the product gas yield shows that the Jiggle Bed Reactor
   allows for a series of precise experiments over a short period of time
   in a small scale setup. In addition, the effects of operating
   parameters, such as temperature, reaction time, S/C ratio as well as
   type and mass of the bed particles on product gas yields, were clearly
   observed and reliable consistency between trends from the Jiggle Bed
   Reactor data and the literature was confirmed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Implantation of artificial urinary sphincters (AUSs) is considered to be
   the gold standard treatment in severe cases of stress urinary
   incontinence. The functioning of these implants is purely
   hydromechanical, as they apply constant pressure around the bulbous
   urethra. Common reasons for device revision are insufficient cuff
   pressure and, in contrast, urethral atrophy secondary to this constant
   pressure. Furthermore, functioning requires some dexterity, limiting
   their implantation in some patients. We present in this study a novel
   electronic AUS that offers the possibility of remotely controlling the
   sphincter rapidly and without mechanical effort. The implant's embedded
   software can also be updated remotely. Its design eliminates the manual
   pump, making implantation easier in men and women. Furthermore, it is
   compatible with already-implanted AUS and can be employed for treating
   other sphincter deficiencies. The device has been tested on a custom
   test bed and on pig bladders in vitro. Different occlusive cuff pressure
   ranges were employed and acceptable performance was obtained. Design
   challenges and results are reported and discussed here.}},

Abstract = {{We study a vehicle routing problem with soft time windows and stochastic
   travel times. In this problem, we consider stochastic travel times to
   obtain routes which are both efficient and reliable. In our problem
   setting, soft time windows allow early and late servicing at customers
   by incurring some penalty costs. The objective is to minimize the sum of
   transportation costs and service costs. Transportation costs result from
   three elements which are the total distance traveled, the number of
   vehicles used and the total expected overtime of the drivers. Service
   costs are incurred for early and late arrivals; these correspond to
   time-window violations at the customers. We apply a column generation
   procedure to solve this problem. The master problem can be modeled as a
   classical set partitioning problem. The pricing subproblem, for each
   vehicle, corresponds to an elementary shortest path problem with
   resource constraints. To generate an integer solution, we embed our
   column generation procedure within a branch-and-price method.
   Computational results obtained by experimenting with well-known problem

Abstract = {{The Pickup and Delivery Problem with Shuttle routes (PDPS) is a special
   case of the Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (PDPTW) where
   the trips between the pickup points and the delivery points can be
   decomposed into two legs. The first leg visits only pickup points and
   ends at some delivery point. The second leg is a direct trip - called a
   shuttle - between two delivery points. This optimization problem has
   practical applications in the transportation of people between a large
   set of pickup points and a restricted set of delivery points.
   This paper proposes three mathematical models for the PDPS and a
   branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm to solve it. The pricing sub-problem,
   an Elementary Shortest Path Problem with Resource Constraints (ESPPRC),
   is solved with a labeling algorithm enhanced with efficient dominance
   rules. Three families of valid inequalities are used to strengthen the
   quality of linear relaxations. The method is evaluated on generated and
   real-world instances containing up to 193 transportation requests.
   Instances with up to 87 customers are solved to optimality within a
   computation time of one hour. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Considering the effects of globalisation, the increase of production and
   energy costs, and the introduction of advanced technologies, companies
   need to change their way of doing business if they want to stay
   competitive. One way of doing this is to establish collaborations with
   suppliers, distributors and retailers, in order to exchange products
   efficiently and create value for customers. Nevertheless, the structure
   of the collaboration must be designed carefully and some coordination
   mechanisms must be implemented to support this way of doing business. In
   this article, we first analyse: why companies work together, how they
   should build their partnership, and which strategies they can implement
   to facilitate coordination of supply chain activities. We then report a
   case study of collaboration in the forest industry that shows the
   benefits of implementing coordination mechanisms as well as the
   necessity of using incentives to better share these benefits.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{406}},
Pages = {{307-319}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{A new multiphase lattice Boltzmann model based on the cascaded collision
   operator is developed to study the spinodal decomposition of critical
   quenches in the inertial hydrodynamic regime. The proposed lattice
   Boltzmann model is able to investigate simulations of multiphase
   spinodal decomposition with a very high Reynolds number. The law
   governing the growth of the average domain size, i.e. L proportional to
   t(alpha), is studied numerically in the late-time regime, when multiple
   immiscible fluids are considered in the spinodal decomposition. It is
   found numerically that the growth exponent, alpha, is inversely
   proportional to the number, N. of immiscible fluids in the system. In
   fact, a = 6/(N + 7) is a simple law that matches the numerical results
   very well, even up to N = 20. As the number of immiscible fluids
   increases, the corresponding drop in the connectivity of the various
   fluid domains is believed to be the main factor that drives and slows
   down the growth rate. Various videos that accurately demonstrate
   spinodal decomposition with different transport mechanisms are provided
   (see Appendix A). The remarks and statement made in this research are
   based on the analysis of 5120 numerical simulations and the
   postprocessing of about 3.5 TB of data. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Off-axis electron holography of ferromagnetic multilayer nanowires}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUL 14}},
Abstract = {{We have used electron holography to investigate the local magnetic
   behavior of isolated ferromagnetic nanowires (NWs) in their remanent
   states. The NWs consisted of periodic magnetic layers of soft,
   high-saturation magnetization CoFeB alloys, and non-magnetic layers of
   Cu. All NWs were fabricated by pulsed-potential electrodeposition in
   nanoporous alumina membranes. The NW composition and layer thicknesses
   were measured using scanning transmission electron microscopy and energy
   dispersive spectroscopy. The magnetization of individual NWs depended
   upon the thicknesses of the layers and the direction of an external
   magnetic field, which had been applied in situ. When the CoFeB was
   thicker than the diameter (50 nm), magnetization was axial for all
   external field directions, while thinner layers could be randomized via
   a perpendicular field. In some cases, magnetization inside the wire was
   detected at an angle with respect to the axis of the wires. In thinner
   Cu/CoFeB (<10 nm each) multilayer, magnetic field vortices were
   detected, associated with opposing magnetization in neighbouring layers.
   The measured crystallinity, compositions, and layer thicknesses of
   individual NWs were found to be significantly different from those
   predicted from calibration growths based on uniform composition NWs. In
   particular, a significant fraction of Cu (up to 50 at. \%) was present
   in the CoFeB layers such that the measured magnetic induction was lower
   than expected. These results will be used to better understand
   previously measured effective anisotropy fields of similar NW arrays.

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUL 8}},
Abstract = {{This paper uses human movement analyses to assess the susceptibility of
   brain stroke, one of the most important causes of disability in elders.
   To that end, a computerized battery of nine neuromuscular tests has been
   designed and evaluated with a sample of 120 subjects with or without
   stoke risk factors. The kinematics of the movements produced was
   analyzed using a computational neuromuscular model and predictive
   characteristics were extracted. Logistic regression and linear
   discriminant analysis with leave-one-out cross-validation was used to
   infer the probability of presence of brain stroke risk factors. The
   clinical potential value of movement information for stroke prevention
   was assessed by computing area under the receiver operating
   characteristic curve (AUC) for the diagnostic of risk factors based on
   motion analysis. AUC mostly varying between 0.6 and 0.9 were obtained,
   depending on the neuromuscular test and the risk factor investigated
   (obesity, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, cigarette
   smoking, and cardiac disease). Our results support the feasibility of
   the proposed methodology and its potential application for the
   development of brain stroke prevention tools. Although further research
   is needed to improve this methodology and its outcome, results are
   promising and the proposed approach should be of great interest for many
   experimenters open to novel approaches in preventive medicine and in
   gerontology. It should also be valuable for engineers, psychologists,
   and researchers using human movements for the development of diagnostic
   and neuromuscular assessment tools.}},

Abstract = {{For the first time, an in situ polymerization technique was applied to
   produce mullite-bonded porous SiC ceramics via a reaction bonding
   technique. In this study, SiC microsized particles and alumina
   nanopowders were successfully coated by polyethylene (PE), which was
   synthesized from the particle surface in a slurry phase reactor with a
   Ziegler-Natta catalyst system. The thermal studies of the resulting
   samples were performed with differential scanning calorimetry and
   thermogravimetric analysis. The morphology analysis obtained by
   transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
   confirmed that PE was successfully grafted onto the particle surface.
   Furthermore, the obtained porous ceramics were characterized in terms of
   their morphologies, phase composition, open porosity, pore size
   distribution, and mechanical strength. SEM observations and mercury
   porosimtery analysis revealed that the quality of the dispersion of
   nanosized alumina powder into the microsized SiC particles was strongly
   enhanced when the particles were coated by polymers with in situ
   polymerization. This resulted in a higher strength and porosity of the
   formed ceramic porous materials with respect to the traditional process.
   In addition, the X-ray diffraction results reveal that the amount of
   mullite as the binder increased significantly for the samples fabricated
   by this novel method. The effects of the sintering temperature, forming
   pressure, and polymer content on the physical and mechanical properties
   of the final porous ceramic were also evaluated in this study. (c) 2014

Abstract = {{Void minimization is an important issue in Resin Transfer Molding (RTM)
   because concentrated porosity can significantly decrease the quality of
   final composite parts. The injection stage is critical, since the
   impregnation of the fibers can generate voids by entrapment of residual
   air. The optimal velocity of the flow front in RTM injections can be
   determined by capillary rise experiments carried out through the fibrous
   reinforcement. Classical wicking investigation techniques are based on
   the visualization of the liquid front during the capillary rise, which
   can be enhanced by fluorescence. However, this technique can only be
   applied to transparent fibers such as glass. For this reason, a new
   approach based on InfraRed Thermography (IRT) is proposed in this paper
   for non-transparent carbon fibers. An inverse algorithm is used to
   estimate the optimal velocity of the flow front during resin injection
   from the thermal images obtained by IRT. This new experimental method
   was validated by comparison with capillary rise experiments carried out
   by fluorescence through glass fibers, after which it was applied to
   carbon fibers in order to determine the optimal impregnation velocity.

Abstract = {{A priori evaluations of inductance, stray capacitance, and dc resistance
   are important aspects in optimizations of inductors. In this paper,
   analytical formulas of the inductance (self and mutual), dc resistance
   (solid and litz wires), and the stray capacitances of coaxial inductors
   were derived for both hexagonal and orthogonal windings. Possible
   imperfections that occurred during the fabrication process were
   accounted by the inclusion of axial and azimuth filling factors into the
   formulations. The formulas presented here were validated using several
   coaxial coils with rectangular cross sections as reported in the
   literature and double tested by measurements. Discrepancies between
   estimated and measured values were less than 1\%. The advantage of the
   present formulation is that optimization efforts are addressed at the
   earliest stages possible of inductor conception and construction.}},

Abstract = {{In rotating ac machines, the saturated flux density waveforms contain
   harmonics, which create minor hysteresis loops. The minor hysteresis
   loops in machine laminations constitute an additional loss which
   requires modifications in traditional core loss formulas. This causes a
   serious challenge in core loss estimation. The task becomes more
   competitive under rotating magnetic fields, where the minor loop
   behavior has not been investigated yet. This paper highlights the
   problem of harmonics in rotating fields and its effect on the core loss
   estimation. In addition, the behavior of minor loops under rotating
   fields is compared with the minor loops under pulsating fields.
   Measurements were carried out on a nonoriented silicon steel sample of
   M36G29 with different fundamental frequencies of interest to the
   industry, 60 Hz and 400 Hz, with consideration of the third harmonic at
   each frequency. A design of magnetizing test fixture based on an
   electromagnetic Halbach array is used to perform these measurements.
   Results are presented and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This study highlights the advantages of chondroitin sulfate (CS) as a
   sublayer combining selective low-fouling properties, low-platelet
   adhesion and pro-adhesive properties on endothelial cells, making CS
   promising for vascular graft applications. These properties were
   evaluated by comparing CS with well-known low-fouling coatings such as
   poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and carboxymethylated dextran (CMD), which
   were covalently grafted on primary amine-rich plasma polymerized (LP)
   films. Protein adsorption studies by quartz crystal microbalance with
   dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) and fluorescence measurements showed that
   CS is as effective as PEG in reducing fibrinogen adsorption (similar to
   90\% reduction). CS also largely reduced adsorption of bovine serum
   albumin (BSA) as well as fetal bovine serum (FBS) but to a lower extent
   than PEG and CMD surfaces (72\% vs 85\% for BSA and 66\% vs 89\% for
   FBS). Whole blood perfusion assays indicated that, while LP surfaces
   were highly reactive with platelets, PEG, CMD, and CS grafted surfaces
   drastically decreased platelet adhesion and activation to levels
   significantly lower than polyethylene terephthalate (PET) surfaces.
   Finally, while human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) adhesion
   and growth were found to be very limited on PEG and CMD, they were
   significantly increased on CS compared to that on bare PET and reached
   similar values as those for tissue culture polystyrene positive
   controls. Interestingly, HUVEC retention during perfusion with blood was
   found to be excellent on CS but poor on PET. Overall, our results
   suggest that the CS surface has the advantage of promoting HUVEC growth
   and resistance to flow-induced shear stress while preventing fibrinogen
   and platelet attachment. Such a nonthrombogenic but endothelial-cell
   adhesive surface is thus promising to limit vascular graft occlusion.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-center study has been set up to accurately characterize the
   optical properties of diffusive liquid phantoms based on Intralipid and
   India ink at near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths. Nine research laboratories
   from six countries adopting different measurement techniques,
   instrumental set-ups, and data analysis methods determined at their best
   the optical properties and relative uncertainties of diffusive dilutions
   prepared with common samples of the two compounds. By exploiting a
   suitable statistical model, comprehensive reference values at three NIR
   wavelengths for the intrinsic absorption coefficient of India ink and
   the intrinsic reduced scattering coefficient of Intralipid-20\% were
   determined with an uncertainty of about 2\% or better, depending on the
   wavelength considered, and 1\%, respectively. Even if in this study we
   focused on particular batches of India ink and Intralipid, the reference
   values determined here represent a solid and useful starting point for
   preparing diffusive liquid phantoms with accurately defined optical
   properties. Furthermore, due to the ready availability, low cost,
   long-term stability and batch-to-batch reproducibility of these
   compounds, they provide a unique fundamental tool for the calibration
   and performance assessment of diffuse optical spectroscopy
   instrumentation intended to be used in laboratory or clinical
   environment. Finally, the collaborative work presented here demonstrates
   that the accuracy level attained in this work for optical properties of
   diffusive phantoms is reliable. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Strain engineering is ubiquitous in the design and fabrication of
   innovative, high-performance electronic, optoelectronic, and
   photovoltaic devices. The increasing importance of strain-engineered
   nanoscale materials has raised significant challenges at both
   fabrication and characterization levels. Raman scattering spectroscopy
   (RSS) is one of the most straightforward techniques that have been
   broadly utilized to estimate the strain in semiconductors. However, this
   technique is incapable of measuring the individual components of stress,
   thus only providing the average values of the in-plane strain. This
   inherit limitation severely diminishes the importance of RSS analysis
   and makes it ineffective in the predominant case of nanostructures and
   devices with a nonuniform distribution of strain. Herein, we circumvent
   this major limitation and demonstrate for the first time the application
   of RSS to simultaneously probe the two local stress in-plane components
   in individual ultrathin silicon nanowires based on the imaging of the
   splitting of the two forbidden transverse optical phonons.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a methodology to use the communication network
   infrastructure, in particular WiFi traces, to detect the sequence of
   activity episodes visited by pedestrians. Due to the poor quality of
   WiFi localization, a probabilistic method is proposed that infers
   activity-episode locations based on WiFi traces and calculates the
   likelihood of observing these traces in the pedestrian network, taking
   into account prior knowledge. The output of the method consists of
   candidates of activity-episodes sequences associated with the likelihood
   to be the true one. The methodology is validated on traces generated by
   a known sequence of activities, while the performance being evaluated on
   a set of anonymous users. Results show that it is possible to predict
   the number of episodes and the activity-episodes locations and
   durations, by merging information about the activity locations on the
   map, WiFi measurements and prior information about schedules and the
   attractivity in pedestrian infrastructure. The ambiguity of each
   activity episode in the sequence is explicitly measured. (C) 2014

Title = {{Optimization of detector positioning in the radioactive particle
   tracking technique}},
Journal = {{APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{89}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The radioactive particle tracking (RPT) technique is a non-intrusive
   experimental velocimetry and tomography technique extensively applied to
   the study of hydrodynamics in a great variety of systems. In this
   technique, arrays of scintillation detector are used to track the motion
   of a single radioactive tracer particle emitting isotropic gamma-rays.
   This work describes and applies an optimization strategy developed to
   find an optimal set of positions for the scintillation detectors used in
   the RPT technique. This strategy employs the overall resolution of the
   detectors as the objective function and a mesh adaptive direct search
   (MADS) algorithm to solve the optimization problem. More precisely,
   NOMAD, a C+ + implementation of the MADS algorithm is used. First, the
   optimization strategy is validated using simple cases with known optimal
   detector configurations. Next, it is applied to a three-dimensional
   axisymmetric system (i.e. a vertical cylinder, which could represent a
   fluidized bed, bubble column, riser or else). The results obtained using
   the optimization strategy are in agreement with what was previously
   recommended by Roy et al. (2002) for a similar system. Finally, the
   optimization strategy is used for a system consisting of a partially
   filled cylindrical tumbler. The application of insights gained by the
   optimization strategy is shown to lead to a significant reduction in the
   error made when reconstructing the position of a tracer particle. The
   results of this work show that the optimization strategy developed is
   sensitive to both the type of objective function used and the
   experimental conditions. The limitations and drawbacks of the
   optimization strategy are also discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper presents a risk-based approach for quality control planning
   of complex discrete manufacturing processes, to prevent massive scraps
   to occur. An analytical model is developed to optimize the quality
   control plan (QCP) subject to inspection capacity limitation and risk
   exposure objectives. The problem is then formulated as a constrained
   capacity allocation problem. A dedicated heuristic that solves a
   simplified instance of an industrial case study, from semiconductor
   manufacturing, is presented to provide insights into the applicability
   and the operational use of the approach and its potential gains in terms
   of risk exposure reduction. The main advancement resulting from this
   work is the proposal of a model of quality control allocation and an
   understandable algorithm to prevent the production of excessive amounts
   of scrap. The industrial illustration shows a decrease in potential

Abstract = {{Three single site catalysts metallocene polyethylenes (mPE) different in
   molecular structure were selected and films from them were produced
   using a semi-industrial cast film extrusion line. Rheological and gel
   permeation chromatography tests were performed on the mPE resins to
   assess their molecular structure. Mechanical, physical and sealability
   properties of the films were evaluated as well as flexural cracking and
   particles encapsulation (caulkability) and the results are discussed in
   relation to the molecular structures of the resins. It was found that
   molecular weight and distribution of short chain branching (comonomer)
   on the backbone of the polyethylene chains are the main factors that
   control sealability, flexural cracking and mechanical properties. The
   placement of comomoner on medium length chains generated crystals with
   smaller size that show a lower melting peak. Sealing was controlled by
   crystal distribution, chain diffusion and entanglement formation at the
   interface. mPE with lower melting point and linear molecular structure
   showed greater hot tack and seal strength. Polydispersity along with
   molecular weight contributed to toughness and puncture resistance.
   Flexural cracking resistance was revealed to be related to
   crystallinity, tie chain density and more importantly to fraction of
   amorphous phase. The amorphous part could absorb flexural energy and
   hinders crack initiation and propagation. Seal through contamination
   (caulkability) was found to be related to flowability of the melt. The
   resin with stronger shear thinning in melt state and lower heat seal
   initiation temperature showed an improved caulkability.}},

Abstract = {{Electroarthrography (EAG) is a novel technology recently proposed to
   detect cartilage degradation. EAG consists of recording electrical
   potentials on the knee surface while the joint is undergoing compressive
   loading. Previous results show that these signals originating from
   streaming potentials in the cartilage reflect joint cartilage health.
   The aim of this study is to contribute to the understanding of the
   generation of the EAG signals and to the development of interpretation
   criteria using computer models of the human knee. The knee is modeled as
   a volume conductor composed of different regions characterized by
   specific electrical conductivities. The source of the EAG signal is the
   load-induced interstitial fluid flow that transports ions within the
   compressed cartilage. It is modeled as an impressed current density in
   different sections of the articular cartilage. The finite-element method
   is used to compute the potential distribution in two knee models with a
   realistic geometry. The simulated potential distributions correlate very
   well with previously measured potential values, which further supports
   the hypothesis that the EAG signals originate from compressed cartilage.
   Also, different localized cartilage defects simulated as a reduced
   impressed current density produce specific potential distributions that
   may be used to detect and localize cartilage degradation. In conclusion,
   given the structural and electrophysiological complexity of the knee,
   computer modeling constitutes an important tool to improve our
   understanding of the generation of EAG signals and of the various
   factors that affect the EAG signals so as to help develop the EAG
   technology as a useful clinical tool.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To design and validate a radiofrequency (RF) array coil for
   cervical spinal cord imaging at 7T.
   Methods: A 19-channel receive array with a four-channel transmit array
   was developed on a close-fitting coil former at 7T. Transmit efficiency
   and specific absorption rate were evaluated in a B-1(+) mapping study
   and an electromagnetic model. Receive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and
   noise amplification for parallel imaging were evaluated and compared
   with a commercial 3T 19-channel head-neck array and a 7T four-channel
   spine array. The performance of the array was qualitatively demonstrated
   in human volunteers using high-resolution imaging (down to 300 mm
   in-plane).
   Results: The transmit and receive arrays showed good bench performance.
   The SNR was approximately 4.2-fold higher in the 7T receive array at the
   location of the cord with respect to the 3T coil. The g-factor results
   showed an additional acceleration was possible with the 7T array. In
   vivo imaging was feasible and showed high SNR and tissue contrast.
   Conclusion: The highly parallel transmit and receive arrays were
   demonstrated to be fit for spinal cord imaging at 7T. The high
   sensitivity of the receive coil combined with ultra-high field will
   likely improve investigations of microstructure and tissue segmentation
   in the healthy and pathological spinal cord. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{The integer least squares problem is an important problem that arises in
   numerous applications. We propose a real relaxation-based
   branch-and-bound (RRBB) method for this problem. First, we define a
   quantity called the distance to integrality, propose it as a measure of
   the number of nodes in the RRBB enumeration tree, and provide
   computational evidence that the size of the RRBB tree is proportional to
   this distance. Since we cannot know the distance to integrality a
   priori, we prove that the norm of the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse
   of the matrix of coefficients is a key factor for bounding this
   distance, and then we propose a preconditioning method to reduce this
   norm using lattice reduction techniques. We also propose a set of valid
   box constraints that help accelerate the RRBB method. Our computational
   results show that the proposed preconditioning significantly reduces the
   size of the RRBB enumeration tree, that the preconditioning combined
   with the proposed set of box constraints can significantly reduce the
   computational time of RRBB, and that the resulting RRBB method can
   outperform the Schnorr and Eucher method, a widely used method for
   solving integer least squares problems, on some types of problem data.}},

Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{In highly urbanized areas, surface water and groundwater are
   particularly vulnerable to sewer exfiltration. In this study, as an
   alternative to Microbial Source Tracking (MST) methods, we propose a new
   method combining microbial and chemical fecal indicators (Escherichia
   coli (E. coli)) and wastewater micropollutants (WWMPs) analysis both in
   water and sediment samples and under different meteorological
   conditions. To illustrate the use of this method, wastewater
   exfiltration and subsequent infiltration were identified and quantified
   by a three-year field study in an urban canal. The gradients of
   concentrations observed suggest that several sources of fecal
   contamination of varying intensity may be present along the canal,
   including feces from resident animal populations, contaminated surface
   run-off along the banks and under bridge crossings, release from
   contaminated banks, entrainment of contaminated sediments, and most
   importantly sewage exfiltration. Calculated exfiltration-infiltration
   volumes varied between 0.6 and 15.7 m(3)/d per kilometer during dry
   weather, and between 1.1 and 19.5 m(3)/d per kilometer during wet
   weather. WWMPs were mainly diluted and degraded below detection limits
   in water. E. coli remains the best exfiltration indicator given a large
   volume of dilution and a high abundance in the wastewater source. WWMPs
   are effective for detecting cumulated contamination in sediments from a
   small volume source and are particularly important because E. coli on
   its own does not allow source tracking. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Tracking algorithms for multi-hexagonal assemblies (2D and 3D)}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY}},

Volume = {{69}},

Abstract = {{Background: There has been a continuous effort to design new reactors
   and study these reactors under different conditions. Some of these
   reactors have fuel pins arranged in hexagonal pitch. To study these
   reactors, development of computational methods and computer codes is
   required. For this purpose, we have developed algorithms to track two
   dimensional and three dimensional cluster geometries. These algorithms
   have been implemented in a subprogram HX7, that is implemented in the
   code DRAGON (Version 3.06F) to compute neutron flux distributions in
   these systems.
   Methods: Computation of the neutron flux distribution requires solution
   of neutron transport equation. While solving this equation, by using
   Carlvik's method of collision probabilities, computation of tracks in
   the hexagonal geometries is required. In this paper we present equations
   that we have developed for the computation of tracks in two dimensional
   (2D) and three dimensional (3D) multi-hexagonal assemblies (with two
   rotational orientations). These equations have been implemented in a
   subprogram HX7, to compute tracks in seven hexagonal assemblies. The
   subprogram HX7 has been implemented in the mcr module of the DRAGON
   code, where tracks in the pins are computed.
   Results: The results of our algorithms NXT(+HX7) have been compared with
   the results obtained by the EXCELT module of DRAGON (Version 3.06F).
   Conclusions: We find that all the fluxes in 2D and fluxes in the outer
   pin (3D) are converging to their 3rd decimal places, in both the modules
   EXCELT and NXT(+HX7). For other regions 3D fluxes, in general, are
   converging to their first decimal places. To improve convergence of
   fluxes, we plan to analyze more lattices in future and study some of the
   reasons behind convergence. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Mass flux in extended and classical hydrodynamics}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 30}},
Abstract = {{In classical hydrodynamics, the mass flux is universally chosen to be
   the momentum field. In extended hydrodynamics, the mass flux acquires
   different terms. The extended hydrodynamics introduced and investigated
   in this paper uses a one-particle distribution function as the extra
   state variable chosen to characterize the microstructure. We prove that
   the extended hydrodynamics is fully autonomous in the sense that it is
   compatible with thermodynamics (i.e., the entropy does not decrease
   during the time evolution) and with mechanics (i.e., the part of the
   time evolution that leaves the entropy unchanged is Hamiltonian).
   Subsequently, we investigate its possible reductions. In some situations
   the emerging reduced dynamical theory is the classical hydrodynamics
   that is fully autonomous (i.e., all the structure that makes the
   extended theory fully autonomous is kept in the reduced theory). In
   other situations (for example, when the fluids under investigation have
   large density gradients) the reduced theories are not fully autonomous.
   In such a case the reduced theories constitute a family of mutually
   related dynamical theories (each of them involving a different amount of

Abstract = {{Smart phones and tablets have become ubiquitous. Corning (R) Gorilla (R)
   Glass is well-known to provide durability and scratch-resistance to many
   smart phones and other mobile devices. Using femtosecond lasers, we
   report high quality photonic devices, such as a temperature sensor and
   an authentication security system, we believe for the first time. It was
   found that this kind of glass is an exceptional host for three
   dimensional waveguides. High quality multimode waveguides are
   demonstrated with the lowest measured loss value (0.027 dB/cm loss) to
   our knowledge in any glass using fs laser inscription. High quality
   (0.053 dB/cm loss) single-mode waveguides have been also fabricated
   using a fs laser scan speed of 300 mm/s, the fastest fabrication speed
   reported to date. The longest high quality waveguides (up to 1m) are
   also reported. Experiments reveal that Gorilla Glass seems to be an
   ideal glass to write waveguides just below the surface, which is of
   great interest in sensing applications. (C) 2014 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new interpretation method for pulse tests, a field
   permeability test that allows for rapid measurements of hydraulic
   conductivity k in aquitards. This new method applies to soft clay
   deposits. To initiate a pulse test, a known volume of water is injected
   into the sand filter of a monitoring well isolated by a packer. The
   resulting pressure increase yields an outward movement of the sand
   filter cavity wall. After presenting the usual interpretation methods
   and their limits, this paper proposes a new interpretation method based
   on a coupled analysis of the pressure and displacement fields in the
   soil using the Biot-Darcy formulation. A series of analytical and
   numerical non-dimensional velocity graphs, normalized plots of the mean
   hydraulic head difference versus its rate of change, are given. For a
   linear elastic material, these type curves show relatively small
   variations with the sand filter aspect ratio and the Poisson ratio of
   the tested clay. The type curves are also found to be independent of the
   clay compressibility (mv) and k, an important result. A series of pulse
   tests conducted in a soft marine clay deposit near Montreal, Canada, are
   interpreted with the proposed method. The hydraulic conductivity values
   calculated from these tests are closely correlated with independent
   estimates obtained using long-duration variable-head tests. Compared
   with previous interpretation methods, the proposed method allows soil
   volume changes to be reconciled with cavity expansion phenomena and the
   range of type curves available for the interpretation of test data to be
   constrained. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   An ecotoxicological perspective}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{484}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Functional stability (FS) is an ecosystem attribute that is increasingly
   promoted in soil health assessment. However, FS is currently assessed
   comparatively, and it is therefore impossible to generate toxicity
   parameters. Additionally, the FS scores in the literature do not
   consider site and contamination history within the score. To address
   these issues, three new FS scores adapted to an ecotoxicological context
   and based on the Relative Soil Stability Index (RSSI) method were
   developed. The aim of the study was then to determine the FS score(s)
   that best describe the toxicity of metal-contaminated field-collected
   soils. Twenty pairs of Zn-contaminated soils (contaminated and reference
   soils) were collected on the field, and their enzymatic FS
   (arylsulfatase, protease, phosphatase and urease) and metal fractions
   (total and bioavailable) were analyzed. New RSSI-based and existing FS
   scores were calculated for each enzyme and correlated to the Zn
   fractions. One of the new RSSI-based scores was well correlated with the
   bioavailable labile Zn concentration for the arylsulfatase, phosphatase
   and urease (coefficients of regression higher than 0.50). Furthermore,
   this FS score was not affected by the soil organic matter and depended
   little on other soil properties. Other FS scores were correlated to
   labile Zn for only one enzyme, which varied according to the score. The
   new RSSI-based score thus better attributed Zn toxicity to
   field-collected soils than other FS scores. Crown Copyright (C) 2014

Title = {{Effect of Corneal Hydration on the Quality of the Femtosecond Laser
   Anterior Lamellar Cut}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 9}},
Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to assess the effect of corneal hydration on
   the quality of the femtosecond laser (FSL) anterior lamellar cut. The
   Visumax FSL was used to dissect an 8-mm-diameter corneal flap in 22 eye
   bank corneas showing various levels of hydration. The intended ablation
   depth was 220 mm in all eyes, which corresponded to the maximal depth
   available with this laser. After the cut, the achieved ablation depth
   was measured using optical coherence tomography images, flap
   separability was assessed by measuring the mean force generated to
   detach the flap, and stromal bed roughness was assessed by measuring the
   Haralick contrast level on the 1000 x scanning electron microscopy
   images of the ablated surfaces. The preoperative central corneal
   thickness ranged from 547 to 1104 mu m (mean +/- SEM: 833 +/- 30 mu m).
   A negative correlation was found between the level of corneal hydration
   and the ablation depth measured in the midperipheral cornea (r = -0.626,
   p = 0.003), the ablation being more superficial in more edematous
   corneas. The Haralick contrast also tended to increase as a function of
   corneal hydration ( r = 0.416, p = 0.061), suggesting that laser
   ablation in edematous corneas results in rougher stromal surfaces. These
   results support the hypothesis that the quality of the FSL lamellar cut
   decreases as the level of corneal hydration increases. Although FSL is
   still considered in the field as the tool of the future for corneal
   dissection, a better understanding of the limits of this tool will be
   needed before it can replace manual or automated stromal dissection
   techniques in hydrated corneas.}},

Abstract = {{The microbial electrolysis process allows producing hydrogen (H-2) as a
   result of the cathodic reaction of the protons coming from the oxidation
   of the organic matter contained in waste water. For the application of
   this technology it is necessary to study the optimal operating
   conditions that allow to scale-up a microbial electrolysis cell to
   produce hydrogen efficiently at low cost. This study used a new approach
   to get high hydrogen production rate in a MEC by achieving in a very
   short time the process for making the anode's bacteria enrichment for
   the biofilm formation. The hydrogen production efficiency was optimized
   through the change of the electrolyte conductivity and the electrode
   surface area/electrolyte volume ratio. It was found that the hydrogen
   production rate increased with the increase of the electrolyte
   conductivity. Its rate (Q(H2)) increased from 0.13 to 0.82 m(3)H(2)/m(3)
   per day when the electrolyte conductivity increased from 7.5 mS/cm to 15
   mS/cm. From the optimization of the electrolyte conductivity and the
   electrode surface area/electrolyte volume ratio, the highest cathodic
   reaction efficiency of 97\% and coulombic efficiency of 21\% were
   obtained. These results show for the first time that the improvement of
   the electrodes bacteria enrichment process at the anode is an important
   approach to enhance the hydrogen production rate in a MEC. The results
   in this study were verified by repeating the experiments more than once
   and comparing our results with similar studies already published in the
   literature. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Abstract = {{Finite element (FE) model studies have made important contributions to
   our understanding of functional biomechanics of the lumbar spine.
   However, if a model is used to answer clinical and biomechanical
   questions over a certain population, their inherently large
   inter-subject variability has to be considered. Current FE model
   studies, however, generally account only for a single distinct spinal
   geometry with one set of material properties. This raises questions
   concerning their predictive power, their range of results and on their
   agreement with in vitro and in vivo values.
   Eight well-established FE models of the lumbar spine (L1-5) of different
   research centers around the globe were subjected to pure and combined
   loading modes and compared to in vitro and in vivo measurements for
   intervertebral rotations, disc pressures and facet joint forces.
   Under pure moment loading, the predicted L1-5 rotations of almost all
   models fell within the reported in vitro ranges, and their median values
   differed on average by only 2 degrees for flexion-extension, 1 degrees
   for lateral bending and 5 degrees for axial rotation. Predicted median
   facet joint forces and disc pressures were also in good agreement with
   published median in vitro values. However, the ranges of predictions
   were larger and exceeded those reported in vitro, especially for the
   facet joint forces. For all combined loading modes, except for flexion,
   predicted median segmental intervertebral rotations and disc pressures
   were in good agreement with measured in vivo values.
   In light of high inter-subject variability, the generalization of
   results of a single model to a population remains a concern. This study
   demonstrated that the pooled median of individual model results, similar
   to a probabilistic approach, can be used as an improved predictive tool
   in order to estimate the response of the lumbar spine. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {{Improving process representation in conceptual hydrological model

Abstract = {{Different sets of calibrated model parameters can yield divergent
   hydrological simulations which in turn can lead to different operational
   decisions or scientific conclusions. In order to obtain reliable
   hydrological results, proper calibration is therefore fundamental. This
   article proposes a new calibration approach for conceptual hydrological
   models based on the paradigm that hydrological process representation,
   along with the reproduction of observed streamflows, need to be taken
   into account when assessing the performance of a hydrological model.
   Several studies have shown that complementary data can be used to
   improve hydrological process representation and make hydrological
   modeling more robust. In the current study, the process of interest is
   actual evapotranspiration (AET). In order to obtain a more realistic
   representation of AET, meteorological variables and the AET mean annual
   cycle simulated by a regional climate model (RCM) driven by reanalysis
   are used to impose constraints during the optimization procedure. This
   calibration strategy is compared to a second strategy which relies on
   AET derived from reference data and to the classical approach based
   solely on the reproduction of observed discharges. The different
   methodologies are applied to calibrate the lumped conceptual model
   HSAMI, used operationally at Hydro-Quebec, for six Canadian
   snow-dominated basins with various hydrometeorological and
   physiographical characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{A new heuristic sublevel mining stope optimizer is presented. The
   optimizer seeks the best locations and lengths of a series of vertical
   raises that, together with the blocks linked to each raise, define a
   mining stope. Five design constraints - the footwall angle, the
   hangingwall angle, the number of raises, the maximum distance of a block
   from a raise, and the minimum width required to move the farthest block
   towards the raise - allow the shape of the sub-stopes associated with
   each raise to be controlled. The optimization is done on the locations
   and lengths of raises using a genetic algorithm to efficiently sample
   the parameters' space. For each raise, a local network is defined in
   cylindrical coordinates around the raise such as to impose the design
   constraints. A maxflow algorithm on the local network is used to
   determine the optimal sub-stope for each raise. All sub-stopes are
   combined to define the global stope for the entire deposit. The best
   global stope is obtained using a genetic algorithm to find the raise
   parameters providing the best profit over the entire deposit. Two
   synthetic cases and one real deposit are used to evaluate the new
   algorithm and compare the results with the single-raise optimizer. The
   multiple raises approach leads to significantly improved economics
   compared with the single-raise stope optimizer, and the dilution is also
   substantially reduced compared to the single-raise-Case.}},

Abstract = {{The Mesh Adaptive Direct Search algorithm (MADS) algorithm is designed
   for nonsmooth blackbox optimization problems in which the evaluation of

   algorithm is not designed for problems with a large number of variables.
   The present paper uses a statistical tool based on variance
   decomposition to rank the relative importance of the variables. This
   statistical method is then coupled with the MADS algorithm so that the
   optimization is performed either in the entire space of variables or in
   sub-spaces associated with statistically important variables. The
   resulting algorithm is called STATS-MADS and is tested on bound
   constrained test problems having up to 500 variables. The numerical
   results show a significant improvement in the objective function value

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Nowadays, the same piece of code should run on different architectures,
   providing performance guarantees in a variety of environments and
   situations. To this end, designers often integrate existing systems with
   ad-hoc adaptive strategies able to tune specific parameters that impact
   performance or energy-for example, frequency scaling. However, these
   strategies interfere with one another and unpredictable performance
   degradationmay occur due to the interaction between different entities.
   In this article, we propose a software approach to reconfiguration when
   different strategies, called loops, are encapsulated in the system and
   are available to be activated. Our solution to loop coordination is
   based on machine learning and it selects a policy for the activation of
   loops inside of a system without prior knowledge. We implemented our
   solution on top of GNU/Linux and evaluated it with a significant subset

Abstract = {{In this paper, we derive analytical expressions to compute the
   covariance matrix of the signals impinging on a reconfigurable antenna
   array. We consider a receiver equipped with a linear antenna array where
   each antenna element can be independently configured to create a
   directive radiation pattern toward a selected direction. In our
   derivation, we assume a multimodal truncated Laplacian distribution to
   model the power angular spectrum (PAS) of the signals arriving at the
   array. Using the derived expressions, we are able to evaluate the
   correlation between the received signals as a function of the signal
   spatial distribution, the antenna array topology, and the radiation
   pattern characteristics of each element in the array. We also study the
   capacity of a reconfigurable multiple-input multiple-output (RE-MIMO)
   system and illustrate its relation to radiation pattern configurations
   and characteristics. We demonstrate how the derived expressions can be
   used to efficiently choose the configuration for each reconfigurable
   antenna element in the array that leads to an optimal compromise between
   low receive correlation and high receive power in order to maximize the
   link capacity. Simulation results are provided to validate our
   analytical expressions.}},

Abstract = {{The orthogonal LSM10 and TE10 modes that are supported by the image
   SINRD (iSINRD) guide and substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) is
   exploited to develop a planar millimeter-wave hybrid orthogonal-mode
   transducer (OMT) within the same dielectric substrate. The two output
   arms are iSINRD guide and an SIW. The proposed co-layered planar OMT
   belongs to a narrowband acute angle class. The design process is
   explained and measurements at 94GHz are presented. No septa or step
   changes in thickness are required. Both modes are excited using WR10
   transitions, where the transition of one mode is orthogonal to the
   other. Therefore, the OMT is fabricated as a back-to-back 4-port OMT;
   two inputs and two outputs for each mode respectively. The lateral
   dimensions of all guiding arms are 0.6x0.635mm(2). An insertion loss of
   around 1.2dB is obtained for both LSM10 and TE10 modes, while isolation
   better than 17dB is obtained for both modes (30dB for the LSM10 mode).}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents some ongoing research carried out in the context of
   the PRISE Project (Research Platform for Embedded Systems Engineering).
   This platform has been designed to evaluate and validate new embedded
   system concepts and techniques through a special hardware and software
   environment. Since much actual embedded equipment is not available,
   corresponding behavior is simulated within a high-level architecture
   (HLA) federation implemented with a run-time infrastructure (RTI) called
   CERTI and developed at ONERA. HLA is currently largely used in many
   simulation applications, but the limited performances of the RTIs raise
   doubts over the feasibility of HLA federations with real-time
   requirements. This paper addresses the problem of achieving real-time
   performances with the HLA standard. Several experiments are discussed
   using well-known aircraft simulators such as Microsoft Flight Simulator,
   FlightGear, and X-plane connected with the CERTI RTI. The added value of
   these activities is to demonstrate that according to a set of innovative
   solutions, HLA architecture is well suited to achieve hard real-time
   constraints. Finally, a formal model guaranteeing the schedulability of
   concurrent processes is also proposed.}},

Title = {{Generalized Solution for Mining Backfill Design}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Underground backfill plays an important role in the mining industry, and
   is one of the key elements in the routine operation of many underground
   mines. Its main role is to improve ground stability and reduce ore
   dilution. Its other advantages include the reduction of surface mining
   waste disposal, which in turn reduces and even eliminates some problems,
   such as tailing dam failure or acid mine drainage (AMD), associated with
   mining waste management. To ensure a safe and economical backfill
   design, the strength of the backfill must be high enough to allow it to
   remain stable during the exploitation of adjacent stopes, at the very
   least. This minimum required strength is usually estimated using a
   solution proposed in the early 1980s. However, this solution includes
   several limitations, including the following: it assumed a zero friction
   angle of backfill; it neglected the surcharge on top of the exposed
   backfill; it assumed an equivalency between the backfill cohesion and
   the bond cohesion (adherence) along the interfaces between the backfill
   and side walls; it neglected the shear strength contributed by friction
   along the interfaces between the backfill and back and side walls, as
   well as the shear strength contributed by cohesion along the interface
   between the backfill and back wall; and it assumed a high aspect ratio
   (height-over-width) stope. Recently, a modified solution was proposed,
   using the same basic approach and many of the same assumptions. In this
   article, the original and modified solutions are first reviewed. Further
   modifications are given, leading to a generalized solution that
   overcomes the limitations involved in the original and modified
   solutions. The generalized solution is validated against experimental
   results available in the literature. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{Microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technology, and surface
   micromachining in particular, have led to the development of
   miniaturized optical devices with a substantial impact in a large number
   of application areas. The reason is the unique MEMS characteristics that
   are advantageous in fabrication, systems integration, and operation of
   micro-optical systems. The precision mechanics of MEMS, microfabrication
   techniques, and optical functionality all make possible a wide variety
   of movable and tunable mirrors, lenses, filters, and other optical
   structures. In these systems, electrostatic, magnetic, thermal, and
   pneumatic actuators provide mechanical precision and control. The large
   number of electromagnetic modes that can be accommodated by
   beam-steering micromirrors and diffractive optical MEMS, combined with
   the precision of these types of elements, is utilized in fiber-optical
   switches and filters, including dispersion compensators. The potential
   to integrate optics with electronics and mechanics is a great advantage
   in biomedical instrumentation, where the integration of miniaturized
   optical detection systems with microfluidics enables smaller, faster,
   more-functional, and cheaper systems. The precise dimensions and
   alignment of MEMS devices, combined with the mechanical stability that
   comes with miniaturization, make optical MEMS sensors well suited to a
   variety of challenging measurements. Micro-optical systems also benefit
   from the addition of nanostructures to the MEMS toolbox. Photonic
   crystals and microcavities, which represent the ultimate in miniaturized
   optical components, enable further scaling of optical MEMS.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the idea of using cable differentials in the architecture
   of planar cable-driven parallel robots is introduced. Cable
   differentials are a type of mechanisms with several outputs driven by a
   single input. Using them in cable parallel manipulators can decrease
   their cost and control complexity. However, due to their kinematic
   constrains, cable differentials cannot be arbitrarily used in the design
   of these manipulators. Thus, a synthesis method is proposed to tackle
   this issue. First, the general requirements and characteristics of
   differentially driven planar cable mechanisms are reviewed. Then, the
   advantages of using these differentials instead of typically actuated
   cables are shown through a comparison between differentially actuated
   planar cable robots and fully actuated ones. The results reveal that
   with the same number of actuators, using differentials may lead to
   larger workspaces and improved kinetostatic properties. Subsequently,
   the systematic synthesis of differentially driven planar cable
   mechanisms is presented. For this, a method to find the different
   arrangements of q cables in a differential is proposed. Then, valid
   arrangements with 2, 3, and 4 cables are investigated. Finally, several
   differential actuation schemes are considered and all possible
   differentials with q = 2, 3, and 4 cables are found.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the successful navigation of a 1-mm Chrome-Steel bead
   along three consecutive polymethyl methacrylate channels inside the bore
   of a 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. The bead traveled
   at a mean velocity of 14 cm.s(-1). This was accomplished using an
   imaging gradient coil (IGC) insert located inside the MRI tube. While
   targeting one side of a bifurcation has been previously demonstrated
   using unidirectional gradient coils, this is the first time that
   magnetic resonance navigation (MRN) of a bead along consecutive channels
   is reported. Experimental results confirm that a clinical regular MRI
   can be used to propel a 1-mm device. In addition, when used at maximum
   power, IGC temperature rise becomes a serious issue that can ultimately
   damage the insert and limit the overall performance. Consequently, this
   paper aims to give some insight into coil temperature management for
   IGC-assisted procedures. A 33-min thermal stress test was carried out
   using 100\% of the IGC power. Steady-state oscillation can be reached by
   interleaving propulsion periods with cooling periods, thus enabling
   longer propulsion procedures. Experimental data showed that the cooling
   time can be used for imaging purposes with no performance loss, thus
   enabling MRN-assisted procedures with multiplexed particle distribution
   assessment.}},

Title = {{Effect of Suppression of Grain Growth of Hot Extruded

Abstract = {{Nanostructured bulk materials are regarded as a means of enhancing the
   performance of thermoelectric (TE) materials and devices. Powder
   metallurgy has the distinct advantage over conventional synthesis that
   it can start directly from nanosized particles. However, further
   processing, for example extrusion, usually requires elevated
   temperatures, which lead to grain growth. We have found that
   introduction of semiconductor nanoparticles of molybdenum disulfide
   (MoS2), a well-known solid lubricant, suppresses grain growth in bismuth
   telluride-based alloys, thus improving the extrusion process. Scanning
   electron microscope images show that adding MoS2 particles at
   concentrations of 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 wt\% to p-type (Bi0.2Sb0.8)(2)Te-3,
   under otherwise identical extrusion conditions, reduces average grain
   size by a factor of four. Scherer's formula applied to x-ray diffraction
   data indicates that average crystallite sizes (similar to 17 nm) of
   powders are not significantly different from those of alloys extruded
   with MoS2 (similar to 18 nm), which is in stark contrast with those for
   conventional alloy (Bi0.2Sb0.8)(2)Te-3 extruded under the same
   conditions (similar to 80 nm). Harman measurements of TE properties
   reveal a decrease of the thermal conductivity accompanied by reduction
   of the room-temperature figure of merit (ZT) from 0.9 to 0.7, because of
   a lower power factor. Above 370 K, however, the performance of alloys
   containing MoS2 surpasses that of (Bi0.2Sb0.8)(2)Te-3, with reduction of
   the thermal conductivity which is more significant at temperatures above
   the cross point of the ZT values.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of copper particles dispersed into Bi1.9Sb0.1Te2.85Se0.15
   nanopowders and sintered by open die pressing (ODP) have been
   investigated. Submicrometric copper particles were obtained by
   decomposing copper acetate molecules dispersed into chalcogenides
   nanopowders. The acetate powders were decomposed during the sintering
   process at 390 A degrees C obtaining a fine dispersion of copper
   particles with dimensions in the order of 500 nm. Contents up to 0.2
   wt.\% of copper were investigated. ODP, previously introduced as a
   forming process for sintering and texturing p-type (Bi0.2Sb0.8)(2)Te-3
   nanopowders, has been applied to n-type chalcogenide: the mixed alloy
   nanopowders and copper acetate were compacted inside a metallic
   protective shell and fast pressed between two heated plates, keeping the
   composite under load for sintering. ODP processing ensures complete
   consolidation of nanopowders and material texturing with the basal (00l)
   planes of the hexagonal crystal cell oriented parallel to the plates.
   The X-ray diffraction pattern shows an orientation factor, f, obtained
   by the Lotgering method, up to 64 \%. Thermoelectric performance of the
   samples was measured by the Harman method in the range of 20-170 A
   degrees C. Figure of merit (ZT) behavior with temperature was improved
   in copper-dispersed samples showing a shift of the maximum value at
   higher temperatures. This effect can be mainly associated with an
   improvement of electrical conductivity, due to the presence of the
   copper particles.}},

Abstract = {{Studies have shown that T-2{*} contrast can reveal features of cortical
   anatomy. However, understanding the relationship between T-2{*} contrast
   and the underlying cyto- and myelo-architecture is not an easy task,
   given the number of confounds, such as myelin, iron, blood vessels and
   structure orientation. Moreover, it is difficult to obtain reliable
   T-2{*} measurements in the cortex due to its thin and folded geometry
   and the presence of artifacts. This review addresses issues associated
   with T-2{*} mapping in the human cortex. After describing the theory
   behind T-2{*} relaxation, a list of practical steps is proposed to
   reliably acquire and process T-2{*} data and then map these values
   within the cortex using surface-based analysis. The last section
   addresses the question: ``What can we gain from T-2{*} cortical
   mapping?{''}, with particular emphasis on Brodmann mapping. (C) 2013

Title = {{Numerical Analysis of Fretting-Wear With a Hybrid Elastoplastic Friction
   Model}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PRESSURE VESSEL TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Fretting-wear is a common problem in different industries, especially
   when it comes to interactions between metallic components. Flow-induced
   excitation forces in heat exchangers for instance cause tube-support
   interactions. The long-term interaction is an important phenomenon,
   which may cause fretting-wear of the tubes. Experimental tests of the
   interaction show the occurrence of stick-slip intermittent behavior in
   the tube response. To precisely simulate the intermittent stick-slip
   behavior, it is crucial to refine the conceptual model of the
   coefficient of friction for the entire motion from absolute zero
   velocity to gross slip phase. The incorporated friction model plays an
   important role in the determination of the level of fretting-wear in the
   system. The friction model should satisfy two important criteria. The
   first important aspect is the strategy of the friction model to detect
   the cessation of sticking, the beginning of partial-slipping, and
   establishment of the sliding region. The second important aspect is
   defining a friction coefficient function for the entire system response
   to precisely represent the transient stick-slip regions. In the present
   work, the velocity-limited friction model was compared with the LuGre
   model, which is a rate-dependent friction model. The effect of varying
   the break-away force and Stribeck effect on the stick-slip region were
   also investigated. Furthermore, the criteria to demarcate the stick-slip
   region in the LuGre model are discussed, and a different method to
   incorporate the Stribeck effect and presliding damping in the Dahl
   friction model is proposed. Using the tangential stress distribution in
   the contact area, a new hybrid spring-damper friction model is
   developed. The model is able to estimate the elastic, plastic, and
   partial-slipping distances during the relative motion. The ability of
   the model to reproduce experimental tests is investigated in the present
   work.}},

Abstract = {{Thermochromic VO2 windows have the potential of managing heat transfer
   in an efficient way. However, several problems such as a high transition
   temperature 68 degrees C and high deposition temperatures (over 400
   degrees C) limit their applicability. We present a novel approach for
   the fabrication of thermochromic VO2 films in which High Power Impulse
   Magnetron Sputtering (HiPIMS) is used for deposition. Indeed, HiPIMS is
   known for its high ionization degree of sputtered species that allows
   one to control the evolution of the film microstructure by ion
   bombardment. The optical and other physical properties of the obtained
   HiPIMS VO2 coatings are first presented. Based on spectrophotometry,
   ellipsometry, AFM, SEM, TOF-SIMS, Raman spectroscopy and XRD results, we
   show that it is possible to deposit dense stoichiometric crystalline VO2
   films at lower substrate temperatures (300 degrees C) compared to other
   approaches. These films exhibit a high infrared modulation (Delta T-2500
   (nm) of 61\% between 30 degrees C and 90 degrees C), low surface
   roughness (R-rms. under 10\% of total thickness for films approximately
   100 nm thick), and lower transition temperatures than the bulk material
   (T-c down to 50 degrees C for thicker films). (C) 2014 Published by

Title = {{Estimating the risk of cyanobacterial occurrence using an index

Abstract = {{The sudden appearance of toxic cyanobacteria (CB) blooms is still
   largely unpredictable in waters worldwide. Many post-hoc explanations
   for CB bloom occurrence relating to physical and biochemical conditions
   in lakes have been developed. As potentially toxic CB can accumulate in
   drinking water treatment plants and disrupt water treatment, there is a
   need for water treatment operators to determine whether conditions are
   favourable for the proliferation and accumulation of CB in source waters
   in order to adjust drinking water treatment accordingly. Thus, a new
   methodology with locally adaptable variables is proposed in order to
   have a single index, f(p), related to various environmental factors such
   as temperature, wind speed and direction. The index is used in
   conjunction with real time monitoring data to determine the probability
   of CB occurrence in relation to meteorological factors, and was tested
   at a drinking water intake in Missisquoi Bay, a shallow transboundary
   bay in Lake Champlain, Quebec, Canada. These environmental factors alone
   were able to explain a maximum probability of 68\% that a CB bloom would
   occur at the drinking water treatment plant. Nutrient limitation also
   influences CB blooms and intense blooms only occurred when the dissolved
   inorganic nitrogen (DIN) to total phosphorus (TP) mass ratio was below
   3. Additional monitoring of DIN and TP could be considered for these
   source waters prone to cyanobacterial blooms to determine periods of
   favourable growth. Real time monitoring and the use of the index could
   permit an adequate and timely response to CB blooms in drinking water
   sources. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the results of single phase CFD simulations of mixing
   vessels with four baffles agitated by a Rushton turbine are used to
   determine the parameters of a two-compartment model that describes the
   turbulent non-homogeneities therein. An improved method is proposed to
   find the boundary between the two characteristic regions. Using this
   method, the effects of different conventional scale-up criteria
   including constant impeller speed, constant impeller tip speed and
   constant power consumption per liquid volume, on the value of the
   compartmental model parameters are investigated. It can be observed that
   the distribution of the turbulent energy dissipation rate and, as a
   result, the compartmental model parameters change considerably when
   following conventional scale-up rules. The concept of a general map of
   compartment energy dissipation rate and volume ratios, which can be used
   for the scale-up of stirred tanks, is introduced.}},

Volume = {{59}},

Abstract = {{Based on the concept of isotropic centered finite differences, this work
   generalizes the spatial order of accuracy of the 2D and 3D isotropic
   discrete gradient operators to a higher order. A suitable methodology is
   used to obtain a set of equations from which it is possible to deduce
   stencil weights to achieve numerical approximations of both high order
   spatial and high order isotropic gradients. We consider that the
   suggested discretization will be useful for enhancing the quality of the
   results in various scientific fields. The spatial order () controls the
   spatial order of accuracy of the gradient norm and direction, while the
   isotropic order () controls, in some situations, the spatial order of
   accuracy of the gradient direction. A useful list of the stencil weights
   needed to construct different high order spatial and isotropic gradients
   is given. Numerical tests show that the numerical spatial orders of
   accuracy of the gradient approximation are the same as those predicted
   theoretically. Also, to illustrate the benefit of the new
   discretizations, some simulations with a multiphase lattice Boltzmann
   model are presented. Then, a series of benchmarks comparing various
   efficient convolution algorithms used to compute function or image
   gradients is presented. Different platforms implemented on CPUs and GPUs
   are studied, namely: plain MATLAB; the Jacket plugin for MATLAB; and
   CUDA. The results show situations in which substantial computational
   speedup can be obtained with CUDA and the Jacket plugin for MATLAB
   versus MATLAB on a CPU. Examples of 2D and 3D gradient computations
   using convolution products performed with our code are available for
   download as electronic supplementary material.}},

Abstract = {{Log-domain Delta-Sigma () modulators are attractive for implementing
   analog-to-digital (A/D) converters (ADCs) targeting low-power
   low-voltage applications. Previously reported log-domain modulators were
   limited to 1-bit quantization and, hence, could not benefit from the
   advantages associated with multibit quantization (namely, reduced
   in-band quantization noise, and increased modulator stability). Unlike
   classical modulators, directly extending a log-domain modulator with a
   1-bit quantizer to a log-domain modulator with a multibit quantizer is
   challenging, in terms of CMOS circuit implementation. Additionally, the
   realization of log-domain modulators targeting high-resolution
   applications necessitates minimization of distortion and noise in the
   log-domain loop-filter. This paper discusses the challenges of multibit
   quantization and digital-to-analog (D/A) conversion in the log-domain,
   and presents a novel multibit log-domain modulator, practical for CMOS
   implementation. SIMULINK models of log-domain modulator circuits are
   proposed, and the effects of various circuit non-idealities are
   investigated, including the effects of log-domain compression-expansion
   mismatch. Furthermore, this paper proposes novel low-distortion
   log-domain analog blocks suitable for high-resolution analog-to-digital
   (A/D) conversion applications. Circuit simulation results of a proposed
   third-order 3-bit class AB log-domain loop-filter demonstrate 10.4-bit
   signal-to-noise-and-distortion-ratio (SNDR) over a 10 kHz bandwidth with
   a differential signal input, while operating from a 0.8 V supply and
   consuming a total power of.}},

Abstract = {{In this second international permeability benchmark, the in-plane
   permeability values of a carbon fabric were studied by twelve research
   groups worldwide. One participant also investigated the deformation of
   the tested carbon fabric. The aim of this work was to obtain comparable
   results in order to make a step toward standardization of permeability
   measurements. Unidirectional injections were thus conducted to determine
   the unsaturated in-plane permeability tensor of the fabric. Procedures
   used by participants were specified in the guidelines defined for this
   benchmark. Participants were asked to use the same values for parameters
   such as fiber volume fraction, injection pressure and fluid viscosity to
   minimize sources of scatter. The comparison of the results from each
   participant was encouraging. The scatter between data obtained while
   respecting the guidelines was below 25\%. However, a higher dispersion
   was observed when some parameters differed from the recommendations of
   this exercise. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Forces at different heights and orientations are often carried by hands
   while performing occupational tasks. Trunk muscle activity and spinal
   loads are likely dependent on not only moments but also the orientation
   and height of these forces. Here, we measured trunk kinematics and
   select superficial muscle activity of 12 asymptomatic subjects while
   supporting forces in hands in upright standing. Magnitude of forces in 5
   orientations (-25 degrees, 0 degrees,25 degrees, 50 degrees and 90
   degrees) and 2 heights (20 cm and 40 cm) were adjusted to generate
   flexion moments of 15, 30 and 45 N m at the L5-S1 disc centre. External
   forces were of much greater magnitude when applied at lower elevation or
   oriented upward at 25 degrees. Spinal kinematics remained nearly
   unchanged in various tasks.
   Changes in orientation and elevation of external forces substantially
   influenced the recorded EMG, despite similar trunk posture and identical
   moments at the L5-S1. Greater EMG activity was overall recorded under
   larger forces albeit constant moment. Increases in the external moment
   at the L5-S1 substantially increased EMG in extensor muscles (p < 0.001)
   but had little effect on abdominals; e. g., mean longissimus EMG for all
   orientations increased by 38\% and 75\% as the moment level altered from
   15 N m to 30 N m and to 45 N m while that in the rectus abdominus
   increased only by 2\% and 4\%, respectively. Under 45 N m moment and as
   the load orientation altered from 90 degrees to 50 degrees, 25 degrees,
   0 degrees and -25 degrees, mean EMG dropped by 3\%, 12\%, 12\% and 1\%
   in back muscles and by 17\%, 17\%, 19\% and 13\% in abdominals,
   respectively. As the load elevation increased from 20 cm to 40 cm, mean
   EMG under maximum moment decreased by 21\% in back muscles and by 17\%
   in abdominals.
   Due to the lack of EMG recording of deep lumbar muscles, changes in
   relative shear/compression components and different net moments at
   cranial discs despite identical moments at the caudal L5-S1 disc,
   complementary model studies are essential for a better comprehension of
   neuromuscular strategies in response to alterations in load height and
   orientation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   the perturbation itself as well as initial trunk conditions. The effect
   of four parameters (preload, sudden load, initial trunk flexed posture,
   initial abdominal antagonistic activity) on trunk kinematics and back
   muscles reflex response were evaluated. Twelve asymptomatic subjects
   participated in sudden forward perturbation tests under six distinct
   conditions. Preload did not change the reflexive response of back
   muscles and the trunk displacement; while peak trunk velocity and
   acceleration as well as the relative load peak decreased. Sudden load
   increased reflex response of muscles, trunk kinematics and loading
   variables. When the trunk was initially flexed, back muscles latency was
   delayed, trunk velocity and acceleration increased; however, reflex
   amplitude and relative trunk displacement remained unchanged. Abdominal
   antagonistic preactivation increased reflexive response of muscles but
   kinematics variables were not affected. Preload, initial flexed posture
   and abdominal muscles preactivation increased back muscles preactivity.
   Both velocity and acceleration peaks of the trunk movement decreased
   with preload despite greater total load. In contrast, they increased in
   the initial flexed posture and to some extent when abdominal muscles
   were preactivated demonstrating the distinct effects of pre-perturbation
   variables on trunk kinematics and risk of injury. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{We show that the residual measures the difference in L-1 between the

   is an extension of earlier work by Ha on the stability of Boltzmann's
   model, and more specifically on a nonlinear interaction functional that
   controls the growth of waves. The two kinetic models that are compared
   in this research are given by (possibly different) inverse power laws,
   such as the hard spheres and pseudo-Maxwell models. The main point of
   the estimate is that the modeling error is measured a posteriori, that
   is to say, the difference between the solutions to the first and second
   model can be bounded by a term that depends on only one of the two
   solutions. This work allows the stability estimate to be used to assess
   uncertainty, modeling or numerical, present in the solution of the first
   model without solving the second model.}},

Abstract = {{Counterfeiting of products and important documents is at an all-time
   high and is costing the world economy hundreds of billions of dollars
   yearly as well as posing significant safety and health hazards through
   the production of uncertified goods, e. g., pharmaceutical products. To
   limit these effects, interference-based optical security devices
   offering an angular color shift are still widely in use. Unfortunately,
   commercial iridescent materials are now readily available and represent
   a potential source of counterfeiting. In this short review, we first
   describe the basic principles behind passive interference security image
   structures (ISIS) and the qualities which have resulted in their
   integration into most important documents. Various features which have
   been added to ISIS in order to make them harder to duplicate yet simpler
   to authenticate are also presented (metamerism, magnetic materials,
   diffraction, etc.). We then address the implementation of active
   materials, mainly electrochromic WO3 as a means of generating two-level
   authentication devices. Finally, we discuss some general considerations
   to keep in mind when developing features for security applications. (C)

Title = {{Compliance potential mapping: a tool to assess potential contributions
   of walking towards physical activity guidelines}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{MAY 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Walking for transport is increasingly considered an
   important component for meeting physical activity guidelines. This is
   true for individuals of all ages, and particularly important for
   seniors, for whom other physical activities may not be recommended. In
   order to evaluate the potential contributions of walking to physical
   activity, in this paper the concept of Compliance Potential Mapping is
   introduced. The concept is illustrated using seniors as a case study.
   Methods: Based on estimates of walking trip distance and frequency,
   estimates of expected total daily walking distance are obtained. These
   estimates are converted to weekly walking minutes, which are in turn
   compared to recommended physical activity guidelines for seniors. Once
   estimates of travel behavior are available, the approach is
   straightforward and based on relatively simple map algebra operations.
   Results: Compliance Potential Mapping as a tool to assess the potential
   contributions of walking towards physical activity is demonstrated using
   data from Montreal's 2008 travel survey. The results indicate that the
   central parts of Montreal Island display higher potential for compliance
   with physical activity guidelines, but with variations according to age,
   income, occupation, possession of driver's license and vehicle, and
   neighborhood and accessibility parameters.
   Conclusions: Compliance Potential Maps offer valuable information for
   public health and transportation planning and policy analysis.}},

Abstract = {{I present several classes of analytical and semi-analytical solutions
   for the design of high-speed rotary optical delay lines that use a
   combination of stationary and rotating curvilinear reflectors. Detailed
   analysis of four distinct classes of optical delay lines is presented.
   Particularly, I consider delay lines based on a single rotating
   reflector, a single rotating reflector and a single stationary
   reflector, two rotating reflectors, and two rotating reflectors and a
   single stationary reflector. I demonstrate that in each of these cases
   it is possible to design an infinite variety of the optical delay lines
   featuring linear dependence of the optical delay on the rotation angle.
   This is achieved via shape optimization of the rotating and stationary
   reflector surfaces. Moreover, in the case of two rotating reflectors a
   convenient spatial separation of the incoming and outgoing beams is
   possible. For the sake of example, all the blades presented in this
   paper are chosen to fit into a circle of 10cm diameter and these delay
   lines feature in excess of 600ps of optical delay. Finally, two
   prototypes of rotary delay lines were fabricated using CNC machining,
   and their optical properties are characterized. (C) 2014 Optical Society

Abstract = {{Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), a subset of Mobile Ad hoc NETworks
   (MANETs), refer to a set of smart vehicles used on the road. These
   vehicles provide communication services among one another or with Road
   Side Infrastructure (RSU) based on wireless Local Area Network (LAN)
   technologies.
   The main benefits of VANETs are that they enhance road safety and
   vehicle security while protecting drivers' privacy from attacks
   perpetrated by adversaries. Security is one of the most critical issues
   related to VANETs since the information transmitted is distributed in an
   open access environment.
   VANETs face many challenges. This paper presents a survey of the
   security issues and the challenges they generate. The various categories
   of applications in VANETs are introduced, as well as some security
   requirements, threats and certain architectures are proposed to solve
   the security problem. Finally, global security architecture for VANETs

Abstract = {{Medial knee osteoarthritis is a debilitating disease. Surgical and
   conservative interventions are performed to manage its progression via
   reduction of load on the medial compartment or equivalently its
   surrogate measure, the external adduction moment. However, some studies
   have questioned a correlation between the medial load and adduction
   moment. Using a musculoskeletal model of the lower extremity driven by
   kinematics-kinetics of asymptomatic subjects at gait midstance, we aim
   here to quantify the relative effects of changes in the knee adduction
   angle versus changes in the adduction moment on the joint response and
   medial/lateral load partitioning. The reference adduction rotation of
   1.6 is altered by + 1.5 to 3.1 and 0.1 or the knee reference adduction
   moment of 17 N m is varied by + 50\% to 25.5 N m and 8.5 N m.
   Quadriceps, hamstrings and tibiofemoral contact forces substantially
   increased as adduction angle dropped and diminished as it increased. The
   medial/lateral ratio of contact forces slightly altered by changes in
   the adduction moment but a larger adduction rotation hugely increased
   this ratio from 8.8 to a 90 while in contrast a smaller adduction
   rotation yielded a more uniform distribution. If the aim in an
   intervention is to diminish the medial contact force and medial/lateral
   load ratio, a drop of 1.5 in adduction angle is much more effective
   (causing respectively 12\% and 80\% decreases) than a reduction of 50\%
   in the adduction moment (causing respectively 4\% and 13\% decreases).
   Substantial role of changes in adduction angle is due to the associated
   alterations in joint nonlinear passive resistance. These findings
   explain the poor correlation between knee adduction moment and
   tibiofemoral compartment loading during gait suggesting that the

Abstract = {{The problem of steering a dynamical system toward optimal steady-state
   performance is considered. For this purpose, a static optimization
   problem can be formulated and solved. However, because of uncertainty,
   the optimal steady-state inputs can rarely be applied directly in an
   open-loop manner. Instead, plant measurements are typically used to help
   reach the plant optimum. This paper investigates the use of optimizing
   control techniques for input adaptation. Two apparently different
   techniques of enforcing steady-state optimality are discussed, namely,
   neighboring-extremal control and self-optimizing control based on the
   null-space method. These two techniques are compared for the case of
   unconstrained real-time optimization in the presence of parametric
   variations. It is shown that, in the noise-free scenario, the two
   methods can be made equivalent through appropriate tuning. Note that
   both approaches can use measurements that are taken either at successive
   steady-state operating points or during the transient behavior of the
   plant. Implementation of optimizing control is illustrated through a
   simulated continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) example.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{1-12}},
Month = {{MAY 7}},
Abstract = {{One aspect that must be addressed when designing tumbling blenders is
   poor axial mixing, which can lead to non-homogeneous mixtures,
   especially when the particle physical and flow properties are different.
   To overcome these limitations, we recently undertook an interest in a
   tetrapodal mixing device patented in 1964. It can be described as two
   V-shaped pairs of arms connected at their bottoms, one of which is
   twisted by 90 degrees. In this work, particle mixing and segregation are
   investigated using the discrete element method in both the V-blender and
   this tetrapodal blender. Results of mixing time and uniformity are
   compared for different loading profiles, fill levels and rotational
   speeds. Compared to the V-blender, this geometry is shown to provide
   better axial and radial mixing efficiency. Good behavior was also
   observed for size segregating granules, yet more investigation would be
   needed for worse cases involving granules with large size ratios and
   different densities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio (CR) systems allow unlicensed secondary users to
   transmit on the licensed frequency bands without degrading the
   transmissions of licensed primary users. Combining CR with other
   emerging techniques such as multi-antenna relaying may bring many
   benefits for the secondary transmissions. In this study, the authors
   propose and investigate a new relay-based cooperation scheme for a CR
   network to improve the secondary access to the licensed spectrum band
   without causing additional interference to the simultaneous primary
   transmission. The proposed scheme considers one multi-antenna relay node
   that can assist either the primary or the secondary transmission using
   beam-forming (BF). In the proposed new scheme, the BF weights are
   designed in the presence of imperfect channel state information (CSI).
   Simulation results show that the secondary's channel capacity is
   significantly improved and outperforms conventional transmission
   schemes. The results also reveal the impact of imperfect CSI on the
   primary outage performance and the efficiency of the proposed solution
   for minimising the interference due to imperfect CSI.}},

   distribution and dynamic weight loss were performed. Five different wood
   species Fagus sylvatica (Beech), Populus nigra (Poplar), Fraxinus
   excelsior (Ash), Pinus sylvestris (Pine) and Abies pectinata (Silver
   Fir) were investigated. The unsteady-state mathematical model equations
   were solved numerically using the commercial package Femlab 2.0. A
   detailed discussion of the computational model and the solution

Abstract = {{Inducible mammalian expression systems are increasingly being used for
   the production of valuable therapeutics. In such system, maximizing the
   product yield is achieved by carefully balancing the biomass
   concentration during the production phase and the specific productivity
   of the cells. These two factors are largely determined by the
   availability of nutrients and/or the presence of toxic waste metabolites
   in the culture environment. Glutamine is one of the most important
   components of cell culture medium, since this substrate is an important
   building block and source of energy for biomass and recombinant protein
   production. Its metabolism, however, ultimately leads to the formation
   of ammonia, a well known inhibitor of cellular growth and productivity.
   In this work, we show that nutrient feeding post-induction can greatly
   enhance the product yield by alleviating early limitations encountered
   in batch. Moreover, varying the amount of glutamine in the feed yielded
   two distinct culture behaviors post-induction; whereas excess glutamine
   allowed to reach greater cell concentrations, glutamine-limited
   fed-batch led to increased cell specific productivity. These two
   conditions also showed distinctive lactate metabolism. To further assess
   the physiological impact of glutamine levels on the cells, a comparative
   13C-metabolic flux analysis was conducted and a number of key
   intracellular fluxes were found to be affected by the amount of
   glutamine present in the feed during the production phase. Such
   information may provide useful clues for the identification of
   physiological markers of cell growth and productivity that could further
   guide the optimization of inducible expression systems. (c) 2014

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{12-20}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Future SuperCritical Water-cooled nuclear Reactors (SCWRs) will operate
   at a coolant pressure close to 25 MPa and at outlet temperatures ranging
   from 500 degrees C to 625 degrees C, i.e., above the critical pressure
   and temperature of the water (22.06 MPa and 373.95 degrees C,
   respectively). Coolant pressures higher than critical values will be
   used to avoid boiling and eventual critical heat flux that may occur. In
   addition, the outlet flow enthalpy in future supercritical water-cooled
   nuclear reactors will be much higher than those of actual ones, which
   can increase overall nuclear plant efficiencies of up to 48\%. However,
   under such flow conditions, thermal-hydraulic behaviors of supercritical
   water are not fully known, i.e., pressure drop, the deterioration of
   forced convection heat transfer, critical (choked) flow, blow-down flow
   rate, etc. In particular, the knowledge of critical discharge of
   supercritical fluids is mandatory to perform nuclear-reactor safety
   analyses and to design key mechanical components. Nevertheless, existing
   choked-flow data have been collected from experiments at atmospheric
   discharge pressure conditions, but in most cases using working fluids
   different than water. Therefore, a supercritical water facility has been
   built at the Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal. In this paper, a new
   database containing 524 data points is obtained using this facility and
   compared with available information from the open literature. Crown

Abstract = {{In recent years, impressive demonstrations related to quantum
   information processing have been realized. The scalability of quantum
   interactions between arbitrary qubits within an array remains however a
   significant hurdle to the practical realization of a quantum computer.
   Among the proposed ideas to achieve fully scalable quantum processing,
   the use of photons is appealing because they can mediate long-range
   quantum interactions and could serve as buses to build quantum networks.
   Quantum dots or nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond can be coupled to
   light, but the former system lacks optical homogeneity while the latter
   suffers from a low dipole moment, rendering their large-scale
   interconnection challenging. Here, through the complete quantum control
   of exciton qubits, we demonstrate that nitrogen isoelectronic centres in
   GaAs combine both the uniformity and predictability of atomic defects
   and the dipole moment of semiconductor quantum dots. This establishes
   isoelectronic centres as a promising platform for quantum information
   processing.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasound imaging, having the advantages of low-cost and
   non-invasiveness over MRI and X-ray CT, was reported by several studies
   as an adequate complement to fluorescence molecular tomography with the
   perspective of improving localization and quantification of fluorescent
   molecular targets in vivo. Based on the previous work, an improved
   dual-modality Fluorescence-Ultrasound imaging system was developed and
   then validated in imaging study with preclinical tumor model. Ultrasound
   imaging and a profilometer were used to obtain the anatomical prior
   information and 3D surface, separately, to precisely extract the tissue
   boundary on both sides of sample in order to achieve improved
   fluorescence reconstruction. Furthermore, a pattern-based fluorescence
   reconstruction on the detection side was incorporated to enable
   dimensional reduction of the dataset while keeping the useful
   information for reconstruction. Due to its putative role in the current
   imaging geometry and the chosen reconstruction technique, we developed
   an attenuation compensated Born-normalization method to reduce the
   attenuation effects and cancel off experimental factors when collecting
   quantitative fluorescence datasets over large area. Results of both
   simulation and phantom study demonstrated that fluorescent targets could
   be recovered accurately and quantitatively using this reconstruction
   mechanism. Finally, in vivo experiment confirms that the imaging system
   associated with the proposed image reconstruction approach was able to
   extract both functional and anatomical information, thereby improving
   quantification and localization of molecular targets. (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{General purpose processors, graphics processing units (GPUs) and
   field-programmable gate-arrays (FPGAs) compete and collaborate to offer
   ever increasing performances. Nevertheless, despite fruitful decades of
   research, FPGA are still a lot more difficult to exploit than
   processor-based approaches. It is today possible to automatically map
   C/C++/SystemC algorithms into circuits. However, exploiting fine grain
   parallelism for control dominant applications is still reserved to
   highly specialized people in hardware design. This paper presents the
   application of our synchronized-transfer-level hardware design
   methodology to the implementation of pipelined floating point operators.
   The methodology builds on a hardware description language for which the
   designer manages dynamic connections between data token sources and
   sinks. A compiler automates the generation and the optimization of the
   synchronization logic, whose low-level complexity is thus hidden to the
   designer. Applied to the design of a floating-point matrix
   multiplication hardware accelerator, the proposed methodology leads to
   similar computing performances than the dedicated designs reported in
   the literature but within shorter design times (hours instead of days),
   simpler source code and no need for advanced hardware design skills. (C)

Journal = {{INFRARED PHYSICS \& TECHNOLOGY}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{When dealing with the registration of information from different image
   sources, the de facto similarity measure used is Mutual Information
   (MI). Although MI gives good performance in many image registration
   applications, recent works in thermal-visible registration have shown
   that other similarity measures can give results that are as accurate, if
   not more than MI. Furthermore, some of these measures also have the
   advantage of being calculated independently from each image to register,
   which allows them to be integrated more easily in energy minimization
   frameworks. In this article, we investigate the accuracy of similarity
   measures for thermal-visible image registration of human silhouettes,
   including MI, Sum of Squared Differences (SSD), Normalized
   Cross-Correlation (NCC), Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Local
   Self-Similarity (LSS), Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT),
   Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF), Census, Fast Retina Keypoint (FREAK),
   and Binary Robust Independent Elementary Feature (BRIEF). We tested the
   various similarity measures in dense stereo matching tasks over 25,000
   windows to have statistically significant results. To do so, we created
   a new dataset in which one to five humans are walking in a scene in
   various depth planes. Results show that even if MI is a very strong
   performer, particularly for large regions of interest (ROI), LSS gives
   better accuracies when ROI are small or segmented into small fragments
   because of its ability to capture shape. The other tested similarity
   measures did not give consistently accurate results. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Ultraviolet-assisted three-dimensional (3D) printing (UV-3DP) was used
   to manufacture photopolymer-based microdevices with 3D self-supported
   and freeform features. The UV-3DP technique consists of the robotized
   deposition of extruded filaments, which are rapidly photopolymerized
   under UV illumination during the deposition process. This paper
   systematically studies the processing parameters of the UV-3DP technique
   using two photo-curable polymers and their associated nanocomposite
   materials. The main processing parameters including materials'
   rheological behavior, deposition speed and extrusion pressure, and UV
   illumination conditions were thoroughly investigated. A processing map
   was then defined in order to help choosing the proper parameters for the
   UV-3DP of microstructures with various geometries. Compared to
   self-supported features, the accurate fabrication of 3D freeform
   structures was found to take place in a narrower processing region since
   a higher rigidity of the extruded filament was required for structural
   stability. Finally, various 3D self-supported and freeform
   microstructures with high potential in micro electromechanical systems,
   micro-systems and organic electronics were fabricated to show the
   capability of the technique.}},

Abstract = {{Parks are elemental components of urban landscapes that provide
   environmental and social function value. In particular, urban parks
   provide spaces for open-air physical activity. In order to enjoy the
   opportunities for activities in parks, users must have reasonable access
   to these resources. A starting point for inquiries about utilization and
   potential benefits of urban green spaces is an assessment of their
   geographical accessibility. Of particular interest, in terms of
   potential users of parks, are children, whose geographical range is
   limited by their ability to traverse space using nonmotorized modes of
   transportation, or by their dependence on adults for common forms of
   motorized mobility. The objective of this paper is to measure
   accessibility to urban parks from the perspective of children traveling
   by walking in Montreal, Canada. Implementation of accessibility measures
   is supported by statistical analysis of trip length using Montreal's
   2008 Household Travel Surveys database. Estimates of trip length based
   on attributes such as age, gender, income class, family structure, as
   well as geographical location are used to calculate accessibility to
   urban parks. We evaluate the relationship between the distribution of
   children population and conditions of accessibility to urban parks to
   understand the potential for use and possible spatial disparities in the
   distribution of urban parks. This research contributes to the assessment
   of the distribution of access to urban parks by children, and can assist
   planners and policy makers to improve the supply of parks, while
   accounting for the mobility patterns of children. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{One of the major concerns of scoliosis patients undergoing surgical
   treatment is the aesthetic aspect of the surgery outcome. It would be
   useful to predict the postoperative appearance of the patient trunk in
   the course of a surgery planning process in order to take into account
   the expectations of the patient. In this paper, we propose to use least
   squares support vector regression for the prediction of the
   postoperative trunk 3D shape after spine surgery for adolescent
   idiopathic scoliosis. Five dimensionality reduction techniques used in
   conjunction with the support vector machine are compared. The methods
   are evaluated in terms of their accuracy, based on the leave-one-out
   cross-validation performed on a database of 141 cases. The results
   indicate that the 3D shape predictions using a dimensionality reduction
   obtained by simultaneous decomposition of the predictors and response
   variables have the best accuracy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{An anti-apoptotic coating combining chondroitin sulfate (CS) and
   coiled-coil-based tethering of epidermal growth factor (EGF) is designed
   for vascular applications. The oriented tethering strategy enables to
   reach higher EGF surface densities compared to the commonly used random
   covalent grafting, while using much lower concentrations of EGF during
   incubation. It also significantly improves vascular smooth muscle cell
   (VSMC) survival and resistance to apoptosis in serum-free conditions.
   The comparison of CS and low-fouling carboxymethylated dextran as a
   sublayer for growth factors highlights the tremendous benefit of CS
   thanks to its selective protein resistance and good cell adhesion
   properties. This approach can be tuned by capturing other growth factors
   on CS through coiled-coil interactions.}},

Title = {{Analytical solution for determining the required strength of a

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Backfilling is well known in the mining industry. A basic issue
   associated with mine backfill design is the determination of the
   strength of the backfill required to maintain the stability of the
   backfill body upon removal of a side wall when an adjacent secondary
   stope is excavated. This task is usually accomplished using a solution
   proposed by Mitchell et al. in the early 1980s. Recently, this solution
   has been reviewed and a modified solution has been proposed. These
   existing solutions, however, were developed for a uniform backfill. In
   practice, mine stopes are usually divided into primary and secondary
   stopes. Primary stopes are often backfilled in two stages: a plug pour
   and a final pour. In many cases, the cement content of the plug pour is
   higher than that of the final pour. The positive effect of the stronger
   plug is neglected in both the original and the modified Mitchell et al.
   solutions. Here, a new analytical solution is developed for estimating
   the required strength of a laterally exposed backfill by taking the plug
   into account. The proposed solution reduces to the modified Mitchell et
   al. solution if the plug pour and final pour have the same cement
   content. If the plug pour has a cement content higher than that of the
   final pour, the required backfill strength calculated with the proposed
   solution is lower than the values estimated with the modified Mitchell
   et al. solution; the same conclusion can be drawn to the comparison
   between the proposed solution and the original Mitchell et al. solution
   when the bond cohesion along the side walls is close to the cohesion of
   the backfill. Furthermore, the proposed solution indicates that an
   optimal cohesion ratio between the plug and final pours exists: there is
   no benefit in using excessively high cement content in the plug pour. It
   is noted that the proposed solution is valid only for high, narrow
   backfilled stopes, solutions for low and wide backfilled stopes are
   under development.}},

Abstract = {{Combining Fluorescent Molecular Tomography (FMT) with anatomical

   Furthermore, using a heterogeneous model for light propagation has been

   heart and aorta molecular imaging, a challenging area due to strong
   tissue heterogeneity and the presence of air-voids due to lungs. First
   investigating performance in a phantom and mouse corpse, the MRI-enabled
   heterogeneous models resulted in an improved quantification of
   fluorescence reconstructions. The system was then used in mice for in
   vivo atherosclerosis molecular imaging. Results show that, when using
   the heterogeneous model, reconstructions were in agreement with the ex
   vivo measurements. Therefore, the proposed system might serve as a
   powerful imaging tool for atherosclerosis in mice. (C) 2014 Optical

Abstract = {{At Ecole Polytechnique Montreal, the philosophy in performing neutron
   activation analysis (NAA) is long-term and application oriented.
   Thinking long-term implies a good understanding of the fundamentals of
   the method, of the samples, of the tools, reactor and detectors, and
   there must be constant innovation that is experimentally validated with
   extensive measurements. Application oriented means a NAA method
   developed to provide users with fast, sensitive, accurate and reliable
   analyses for various types of materials. This philosophy dictates the
   manner in which the developments in the areas of NAA software, peak-area
   calculation, dead-time correction, detection efficiency model, k (0) and
   Q (0) values, neutron moderation and neutron self-shielding are carried
   out. This paper presents a survey of the Laboratory's methodology,
   reviewing a few of its unique features such as detector efficiency
   calibration and sample related perturbations of the neutron activation.
   These features are used as examples to provide the reader with an
   understanding of the philosophy and the evolution of the NAA method at

Volume = {{300}},

Abstract = {{The Westcott formalism was developed to accurately describe the
   activation of nuclides whose neutron capture cross-sections do not
   follow the 1/v-law and it was incorporated in the k (0)-method about 20
   years ago. However, its implementation in the original fashion is not
   easy, requiring the use of a different formalism for the non-1/v
   nuclides, with a g(T (n)) factor for the thermal neutron activation and
   an s (0) factor for epithermal activation, the measurement of the
   neutron spectral index of the irradiation channel and the irradiation of
   a temperature monitor with each batch of samples as well. In this work
   we investigated the accuracy of maintaining the simpler formula of the
   Hogdahl convention for all nuclides and introducing the g(T (n)) factor
   for the thermal neutron activation for non-1/v nuclides. The epithermal
   activation is calculated using a Q (0)-value estimated from the measured
   s (0)-value for non-1/v nuclides. This new approach has been shown, by
   calculations with the parameters of the neutron spectra of five
   irradiation channels, not to give a significant loss of accuracy
   relative to the Westcott formalism.}},

Abstract = {{Solids and powders can be analysed directly and with good accuracy by
   neutron activation analysis without sample preparation because of the
   excellent penetrating powers of neutrons and gamma rays. However, if the
   sample contains high concentrations of gamma-absorbing heavy elements or
   neutron-absorbing elements, the analysis results must be corrected for
   neutron self-shielding and gamma-ray attenuation. These effects are
   coupled and depend on the chemical composition of the sample, which is
   the final result of the analysis. Thus, the correction calculation must
   be iterative. In this work we performed the first coupled iterative
   corrections of the two effects. Six test samples were prepared by mixing
   powders containing compounds of Cd, a neutron absorber, and the
   rare-earth elements Ce, Pr and Nd with concentrations as high as 47 \%.
   The samples were irradiated in the SLOWPOKE research reactor and counted
   with a germanium gamma-ray detector. In the samples with the highest
   heavy element concentrations, the uncorrected Neutron activation
   analysis results were in error by as much as 55 \%. The results were
   corrected iteratively using the neutron self-shielding model coupled
   with the gamma-ray attenuation model, and the final corrected results
   were accurate to 5 \% or better.}},

   the two laboratories, k (0)-values were measured for Ir-192 and Ir-194

Abstract = {{Low-temperature plasma science and technology has made enormous strides
   during the past half-century. To a significant extent, the driver has
   been integrated circuit (IC) processing, because without plasma-based
   etching and deposition techniques, the progression of Moore's law would
   have ceased its course long ago. Scientific and technological advances
   no less spectacular than those in the IC sector, and of comparable
   economic impact, have occurred in the area of plasmas and polymers,
   where a third process type, surface modification, can be added to those,
   etching-or ablation, and deposition, mentioned above. In this article,
   we start by listing a number of particular features associated with the
   exposure of polymers to low-temperature plasmas, for example the
   liberation of volatile molecular fragments from the surface due to bond
   scissions, the accompanying creation of free radicals, cross-linking and
   grafting reactions induced by this and by vacuum-ultraviolet photon
   irradiation from excited species in the plasma, etc. All these aspects
   are of far lesser impact, if any at all, when the same plasmas are in
   contact with inorganic surfaces. We then list some high-volume
   industrial processes and operational details drawn from diverse economic
   sectors. These are accompanied by detailed example-cases from our own
   laboratories, based on both low- and atmospheric-pressure
   low-temperature plasma processes.}},

Abstract = {{In order to improve the throughput of surface plasmon resonance-based
   biosensors, an on-line iterative optimization algorithm has been
   presented aiming at reducing experimental time and material consumption
   without any loss of confidence on kinetic parameters {[}De Crescenzo
   (2008) J. Mol Recognit., 21, 256-66.]. This algorithm was based on a
   simple Langmuirian model to compute the confidence and predict optimal
   injections. However, this kinetic model is not suitable for all
   interactions, as it does not include mass transfer limitation that may
   occur for fast interaction kinetics. If a simple model was to be used
   when this phenomenon influenced the interactions, kinetic parameters
   would be biased. On the other hand, we show in this paper that data
   analysis with a kinetic model including a mass transfer limitation step
   would lead to longer experiments and poorer confidence if the
   interactions were simple. So, in this manuscript, we present an on-line
   model discrimination and optimization approach to increase the
   throughput of surface plasmon resonance biosensors. Copyright (c) 2014

Abstract = {{This review paper describes the past, present and future design of
   therapeutic magnetic carriers (TMMC) being guided in the vascular
   network using a novel technique known as magnetic resonance navigation
   (MRN). This targeting method is an extension of magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) technologies. MRN, based on magnetic gradient variation,
   aims to navigate carriers in real-time along a pre-planned trajectory
   from their injection site to a targeted area. As such, this approach
   should minimize systemic distribution of toxic agents loaded into the
   carriers and improve therapeutic efficacy by delivering a larger
   proportion of the drug injected. MRN-compatible carriers (shape,
   material, size, magnetic properties, biocompatibility) have to be
   designed by taking into consideration the constraints of the medical
   task and MRN. In the past, as a proof of concept of MRN feasibility, a
   1.5-mm ferromagnetic bead was guided in the artery of a living swine
   with a clinical MRI system. Present day, to aim at medical applications,
   TMMC have been designed for targeted liver chemoembolization by MRN.
   TMMC are 50-mu m biodegradable microparticles loaded with iron-cobalt
   nanoparticles and doxorubicin as an antitumor drug. TMMC were
   selectively guided to the right or left liver lobes in a rabbit model
   with a clinical MRI scanner upgraded with steering coils. To treat human
   liver tumor, according to the theoretical MRN model, future TMMC design
   should take into consideration magnetic nanoparticle properties (nature
   and loading), MRN platform performances (gradient amplitude and rise
   time) and vascular hepatic network properties (blood flow velocity and
   geometry) to optimize the carrier diameter for efficient
   chemoembolization.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new framework for capturing large and complex
   deformations in image registration and atlas construction. This
   challenging and recurrent problem in computer vision and medical imaging
   currently relies on iterative and local approaches, which are prone to
   local minima and, therefore, limit present methods to relatively small
   deformations. Our general framework introduces to this effect a new
   direct feature matching technique that finds global correspondences
   between images via simple nearest-neighbor searches. More specifically,
   very large image deformations are captured in Spectral Forces, which are
   derived from an improved graph spectral representation. We illustrate
   the benefits of our framework through a new enhanced version of the
   popular Log-Demons algorithm, named the Spectral Log-Demons, as well as
   through a groupwise extension, named the Groupwise Spectral Log-Demons,
   which is relevant for atlas construction. The evaluations of these
   extended versions demonstrate substantial improvements in accuracy and
   robustness to large deformations over the conventional Demons
   approaches.}},

Abstract = {{If an initially homogeneous system at high temperature is rapidly
   cooled, a temporary para-equilibrium state may result in which rapidly
   diffusing elements have reached equilibrium but more slowly diffusing
   elements have remained essentially immobile. The best known example
   occurs when homogeneous austenite is quenched. A para-equilibrium phase
   assemblage may be calculated thermodynamically by Gibbs free energy
   minimization under the constraint that the ratios of the slowly
   diffusing elements are the same in all phases. Several examples of
   calculated para-equilibrium phase diagram sections are presented and the
   application of the Phase Rule is discussed. Although the rules governing
   the geometry of these diagrams may appear at first to be somewhat
   different from those for full equilibrium phase diagrams, it is shown
   that in fact they obey exactly the same rules with the following
   provision. Since the molar ratios of non-diffusing elements are the same
   in all phases at para-equilibrium, these ratios act, as far as the
   geometry of the diagram is concerned, like ``potential'' variables (such
   as T, pressure or chemical potentials) rather than like ``normal''
   composition variables which need not be the same in all phases. A
   general algorithm to calculate para-equilibrium phase diagrams is
   presented. In the limit, if a para-equilibrium calculation is performed
   under the constraint that no elements diffuse, then the resultant phase
   diagram shows the single phase with the minimum Gibbs free energy at any
   point on the diagram; such calculations are of interest in physical
   vapor deposition when deposition is so rapid that phase separation does
   not occur. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicle routing attributes are extra characteristics and decisions that
   complement the academic problem formulations and aim to properly account
   for real-life application needs. Hundreds of methods have been
   introduced, in recent years for specific attributes, but the development
   of a single, general-purpose algorithm, which is both efficient and
   applicable to a wide family of variants remains a considerable
   challenge. Yet, such a development is critical for understanding the
   proper impact of attributes on resolution approaches, and to answer the
   needs of actual applications. This paper contributes towards addressing
   these challenges with a component-based design for heuristics, targeting
   multi-attribute vehicle routing problems, and an efficient
   general-purpose solver. The proposed Unified Hybrid Genetic Search
   metaheuristic relies on problem-independent unified local search,
   genetic operators, and advanced diversity management methods. Problem
   specifics are confined to a limited part of the method and are addressed
   by means of assignment, sequencing, and route-evaluation components,
   which are automatically selected and adapted and provide the fundamental
   operators to manage attribute specificities. Extensive computational
   experiments on 29 prominent vehicle routing variants, 42 benchmark
   instance sets and overall 1099 instances, demonstrate the remarkable
   performance of the method which matches or outperforms the current
   state-of-the-art problem-tailored algorithms. Thus, generality does not
   necessarily go against efficiency for these problem classes. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Contamination problem in jewelry and toys and children's exposure
   possibility have been previously demonstrated. For this study, risk from
   oral exposure has been characterized for highly contaminated metallic
   toys and jewelry ((MJ), n = 16) considering three scenarios. Total and
   bioaccessible concentrations of Cd, Cu, Ni, and Pb were high in selected
   MJ. First scenario (ingestion of parts or pieces) caused unacceptable
   risk for eight items for Cd, Ni, and/or Pb (hazard index (HI) > 1, up to
   75, 5.8, and 43, respectively). HI for ingestion of scraped-off material
   scenario was always <1. Finally, saliva mobilization scenario caused HI
   > 1 in three samples (two for Cd, one for Ni). Risk characterization
   identified different potentially hazardous items compared to United
   States, Canadian, and European Union approaches. A comprehensive
   approach was also developed to deal with complexity and drawbacks caused
   by various toy/jewelry definitions, test methods, exposure scenarios,
   and elements considered in different regulatory approaches. It includes
   bioaccessible limits for eight priority elements (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg,
   Ni, Pb, and Sb). Research is recommended on metals bioaccessibility
   determination in toys/jewelry, in vitro bioaccessibility test
   development, estimation of material ingestion rates and frequency,
   presence of hexavalent Cr and organic Sn, and assessment of prolonged
   exposure to MJ. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},

Number = {{16}},

Abstract = {{We studied the impact excitation power on the plasmonic enhancement of
   Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between CdSe/ZnS colloidal
   dots. We showed that when such quantum dots (QDs) were in the vicinity
   of metallic nanoparticles (MNPs), with the increase of the excitation
   laser intensity the spectral width of their emission was initially
   increased and then decreased, reaching its original value when the laser
   intensity was low. Such a spectral lineshape recovery happened while the
   emission peak wavelength of the quantum dots underwent a significant
   amount of red shift. By tuning the exciton-plasmon coupling strength and
   including the effects of the heat generated by plasmonic absorption, we
   showed that these results could be explained in terms of transition from
   a donor-dominated spectrum at low laser intensity to an
   acceptor-dominated one at high laser intensity. This suggests that
   excitation intensity can increase the rate of FRET between colloidal QDs
   when they are in close proximity to MNPs.}},

Abstract = {{New definitions of the Reynolds and power numbers proposed by Farhat,

   extended to some other types of multishaft mixers not considered

   applicable for the dual shaft mixer configurations and the Superb lend
   mixer. This universal applicability allowed the authors to
   experimentally investigate and compare the power consumption and the
   mixing time in the coaxial, the dual shaft, and the Superb lend mixers
   based on uniform criteria. It was found that the Mixel TT-Anchor
   combination is the most power-efficient combination, whereas the Superb
   lend mixer requires the most power. Besides, a general approach was
   introduced to predict the power constant of these multishaft mixers.
   Finally, the limitations of the new correlations were pointed out
   through the extension study of their applicability in Superb lend and
   Rotor Stator-Paravisc dual shaft mixer.}},

   Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 22}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate multimodal MRI of the spinal cord in predicting
   disease progression and one-year clinical status in amyotrophic lateral
   sclerosis (ALS) patients.
   Materials and Methods: After a first MRI (MRI1), 29 ALS patients were
   clinically followed during 12 months; 14/29 patients underwent a second
   MRI (MRI2) at 1163 months. Cross-sectional area (CSA) that has been
   shown to be a marker of lower motor neuron degeneration was measured in
   cervical and upper thoracic spinal cord from T2-weighted images.
   Fractional anisotropy (FA), axial/radial/mean diffusivities (lambda(1),
   lambda(H1), MD) and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) were measured
   within the lateral corticospinal tract in the cervical region. Imaging
   metrics were compared with clinical scales: Revised ALS Functional
   Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) and manual muscle testing (MMT) score.
   Results: At MRI1, CSA correlated significantly (P < 0.05) with MMT and
   arm ALSFRS-R scores. FA correlated significantly with leg ALFSRS-R
   scores. One year after MRI1, CSA predicted (P < 0.01) arm ALSFSR-R
   subscore and FA predicted (P, 0.01) leg ALSFRS-R subscore. From MRI1 to
   MRI2, significant changes (P < 0.01) were detected for CSA and MTR. CSA
   rate of change (i.e. atrophy) highly correlated (P < 0.01) with arm
   ALSFRS-R and arm MMT subscores rate of change.
   Conclusion: Atrophy and DTI metrics predicted ALS disease progression.
   Cord atrophy was a better biomarker of disease progression than
   diffusion and MTR. Our study suggests that multimodal MRI could provide
   surrogate markers of ALS that may help monitoring the effect of disease-
   modifying drugs.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of optical coatings may be negatively affected by the
   deleterious effects of mechanical stress. In this work, we propose an
   optimization tool for the design of optical filters taking into account
   both the optical and mechanical properties of the substrate and of the
   individual deposited layers. The proposed method has been implemented as
   a supplemental module in the OpenFilters open source design software. It
   has been experimentally validated by fabricating multilayer stacks using
   e-beam evaporation, in combination with their mechanical stress
   assessment performed as a function of temperature. Two different
   stress-compensation strategies were evaluated: (a) design of two
   complementary coatings on either side of the substrate and (b)
   implementing the mechanical properties of the individual materials in
   the design of the optical coating on one side only. This approach has
   been tested by the manufacture of a Fabry-Perot etalon used in astronomy
   while using evaporated SiO2 and TiO2 films. We found that the substrate
   curvature can be decreased by 85\% and 49\% for the first and second
   strategies, respectively. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{The biorefinery concept offers a promising solution to transform the
   struggling forestry industry. Not only will the implementation of new
   products and processes help to diversify revenues, it will also offer an
   opportunity to change the manufacturing culture by better managing the
   flexibility of assets to react to volatile market conditions. In this
   paper, an integrated supply-chain planning framework is presented. It is
   based on optimizing a superstructure to help decision makers identify
   different supply-chain policies to adapt to different market conditions.
   It integrates revenue management concepts, activity-based cost
   accounting principles, manufacturing flexibility and supply-chain
   flexibility in a tactical model to maximize profit in a price-volatile
   environment. A case study of a newsprint mill implementing a parallel
   biomass fractionation line producing several biochemicals is used to
   illustrate this approach. Results and benefits are presented for the
   traditional pulp and paper business and for the transformed biorefinery
   in different market scenarios. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In order to derive higher value operational knowledge from raw process
   measurements, advanced techniques and methodologies need to be
   exploited. In this paper a methodology for online steady-state detection
   in continuous processes is presented. It is based on a wavelet
   multiscale decomposition of the temporal signal of a measured process
   variable, which simultaneously allows for two important pre-processing
   tasks: filtering-out the high frequency noise via soft-thresholding and
   correcting abnormalities by analyzing the maximums of wavelet transform
   modulus. Wavelet features involved in the pre-processing task are
   simultaneously exploited in analyzing a process trend of measured
   variable. The near steady state starting and ending points are
   identified by using the first and the second order of wavelet transform.
   Simultaneously a low filter with a probability density function is
   employed to approximate the duration of a near stationary condition. The
   method provides an improvement in the quality of steady-state data sets,
   which will directly improve the outcomes of data reconciliation and
   manufacturing costs. A comparison with other steady-state detection
   methods on an example of case study indicates that the proposed
   methodology is efficient in detecting steady-state and suitable for
   online implementation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are electromagnetic excitations
   coupled to electron-charge density waves at metal-dielectric interfaces.
   They have recently been found to enable a range of nanophotonic devices
   for controlling systems at the quantum level, including single-photon
   sources, transistors, and ultracompact quantum circuitry. An important
   quantum feature of SPPs yet to be fully explored is their bosonic
   nature. In this work, we report direct evidence of the bosonic nature of
   SPPs in a scattering-based beam splitter. A parametric down-conversion
   source is used to produce two indistinguishable photons, each of which
   is converted into a SPP on a metal-stripe waveguide and then made to
   interact through a semitransparent Bragg mirror. In this plasmonic
   analog of the Hong-Ou-Mandel experiment, we measure a coincidence dip
   with a visibility of 72\%, a key signature that SPPs are bosons and that
   quantum interference is clearly involved. Our work opens up
   possibilities for the study of fundamental quantum effects in plasmonic
   systems and their related applications.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrophilic and hydrophobic thin films have been deposited onto flat
   metallic substrates through photo-initiated chemical vapor deposition
   (PICVD), using syngas as a precursor, and affordable UVC germicidal
   lamps as a source of light. This study is the first experimental
   investigation of what has been previously concluded to be the potential
   solution to the current widespread nanoparticle functionalization
   problem. This study addresses the current limiting factor, namely the
   cost issue, by using simple gas precursors, using an affordable
   initiation source and operating under normal conditions. This approach
   differs from the current approaches which use expensive solvents as
   precursors, energy consuming-sources of initiation (e.g. high
   temperature, plasma and VUV) and operate under high vacuum and/or high
   temperatures. While the current paradigm is to target the peak
   absorption of a molecule, the present study indicates that long chain
   polymerized products can be formed from off-peak wavelengths. It has
   been found that photo-initiated deposition occurs and that a wide range
   of water contact angles, from 5 to 118, can be obtained by manipulating
   the experimental conditions. A multilinear empirical model has been
   derived, and it predicts fairly well the contact angles obtained as a
   function of the different experimental parameters. (c) 2014 Elsevier

Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: It is our aim to understand the mechanisms that make calcium
   phosphates, such as bioactive calcium hydroxyapatite (HA), and biphasic
   calcium (BCP) and p-tricalcium (I3-TCP) phosphates, desirable for a
   variety of biological applications, such as the filling of bone defects.
   Methods: Here, we have characterized these materials by X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR),
   time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOP-SIMS) and laser
   granulometry. Results: SEM shows clearly that BCP is a matrix made of
   macro-organized microstructure, giving insight to the specially chosen
   composition of the BCP that offers both an adequate scaffold and good
   porosity for further bone growth. As revealed by laser granulometry, the
   particles exhibit a homogeneous size distribution, centered at a value
   somewhat larger than the expected 500 p.m. XPS has revealed the presence
   of adventitious carbon at all sample surfaces, and has shown that Ca/P
   and 0/Ca ratios in the outer layers of all the samples differ
   significantly from those expected. A peak-by-peak XPS comparison for all
   samples has revealed that TCP and BCP are distinct from one another in
   the relative intensities of their oxygen peaks. The PO/PO i and
   CaOH+/Ca+ TOF-SIMS intensity ratios were used to distinguish among the
   samples, and to demonstrate that the OH- fragment, present in all the
   samples, is not formed during fragmentation but exists at the sample
   surface, probably as a contaminant. Conclusions: This study provides
   substantial insight into the nanoscale surface properties of BCP, HA and
   13-TCP. Further research is required to help identify the effect of
   surfaces of these bioceramics with proteins and several biological
   fluids. Clinical relevance: The biological performance of implanted
   synthetic graft bone biomaterials is strongly influenced by their
   nanosurface characteristics, the structures and properties of the outer
   layer of the biomaterial. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   Lateral Geniculate Nucleus with Optogenetics}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 11}},
Abstract = {{Optogenetics allows the control of cellular activity using focused
   delivery of light pulses. In neuroscience, optogenetic protocols have
   been shown to efficiently inhibit or stimulate neuronal activity with a
   high temporal resolution. Among the technical challenges associated with
   the use of optogenetics, one is the ability to target a spatially
   specific population of neurons in a given brain structure. To address
   this issue, we developed a side-illuminating optical fiber capable of
   delivering light to specific sites in a target nucleus with added
   flexibility through rotation and translation of the fiber and by varying
   the output light power. The designed optical fiber was tested in vivo in
   visual structures of ChR2-expressing transgenic mice. To assess the
   spatial extent of neuronal activity modulation, we took advantage of the
   hallmark of the visual system: its retinotopic organization. Indeed, the
   relative position of ganglion cells in the retina is transposed in the
   cellular topography of both the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN)
   in the thalamus and the primary visual cortex (V1). The optical fiber
   was inserted in the LGN and by rotating it with a motor, it was possible
   to sequentially activate different neuronal populations within this
   structure. The activation of V1 neurons by LGN projections was recorded
   using intrinsic optical imaging. Increasing light intensity (from 1.4 to
   8.9 mW/mm(2)) led to increasing activation surfaces in V1. Optogenetic
   stimulation of the LGN at different translational and rotational
   positions was associated with different activation maps in V1. The
   position and/or orientation of the fiber inevitably varied across
   experiments, thus limiting the capacity to pool data. With the
   optogenetic design presented here, we demonstrate for the first time a
   transitory and spatially-concise activation of a deep neuronal
   structure. The optogenetic design presented here thus opens a promising
   avenue for studying the function of deep brain structures.}},

Title = {{Steeper posterior tibial slope markedly increases ACL force in both

Abstract = {{The role of the posterior tibial slope (PTS) in anterior cruciate
   ligament (ACL) risk of injury has been supported by many imaging studies
   but refuted by some in vitro works. The current investigation was
   carried out to compute the effect of +/- 50 degrees change in PTS on
   knee joint biomechanics in general and ACL force/strain in particular.
   Two validated finite element (FE) models of the knee joint were
   employed; one active lower extremity musculoskeletal model including a
   complex FE model of the knee joint driven by in vivo kinematics/kinetics
   collected in gait of asymptomatic subjects, and the other its isolated
   unconstrained passive tibiofemoral (TF) joint considered under 1400 N
   compression at four different knee flexion angles (0 degrees-45
   degrees). In the TF model, the compression force was applied at the
   joint mechanical balance point causing no rotations in sagittal and
   frontal planes.
   Changes in PTS moderately affected muscle forces and joint contact
   forces at mid-stance period. Both active (at mid-stance) and passive (at
   all flexion angles) models showed a substantial increase in the anterior
   tibial translation and ACL force as PTS increased with reverse trends as
   PTS decreased. In the active model of gait at mid-stance, ACL force
   increased by 75\% (from 181 N to 317 N) in steeper PTS but decreased by
   44\% (to 102 N) in flatter PTS. The posterolateral bundle of ACL carried
   the load at smaller flexion angles with a shift to its anteromedial
   bundle as flexion increased. In accordance with earlier imaging studies,
   greater PTS is a major risk factor for ACL rupture especially in
   activities involving large compression forces. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

   of bimetallic nanoparticles}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{13}},
Month = {{APR 7}},
Abstract = {{We studied plasmonic features of bimetallic nanostructures consisting of
   gold nanoisland cores semi-coated with a chromium layer and explored how
   they influence emission of CdSe/ZnS quantum dots. We showed that,
   compared with chromium-covered glass substrates without the gold cores,
   the bimetallic nanostructures could significantly enhance the emission
   of the quantum dots. We studied the impact of the excitation intensity
   and thickness of the chromium layer on this process and utilized
   numerical means to identify the mechanisms behind it. Our results
   suggest that when the chromium layer is thin, the enhancement process is
   the result of the bimetallic plasmonic features of the nanostructures.
   As the chromium layer becomes thick, the impact of the gold cores is
   screened and the enhancement mostly happens mostly via the field
   enhancement of chromium nanoparticles in the absence of significant
   energy transfer from the quantum dots to these nanoparticles. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{This study aimed the optimization of culture condition and composition
   for production of Cryptococcus laurentii 11 biomass and lipids in cheese
   whey medium supplemented with sugarcane molasses. The optimization of
   pH, fermentation time, and molasses concentration according to a full
   factorial statistical experimental design was followed by a
   Plackett-Burman experimental design, which was used to determine whether
   the supplementation of the culture medium by yeast extract and inorganic
   salts could provide a further enhancement of lipids production. The
   following conditions and composition of the culture medium were found to
   optimize biomass and lipids production: 360 h fermentation, 6.5 pH and
   supplementation of (g L-1): 50 molasses, 0.5 yeast extract, 4 KH2PO4, 1
   Na2HPO4, 0.75 MgSO4 center dot 7H(2)O and 0.002 ZnSO4 center dot H2O.
   Additional supplementation with inorganic salts and yeast extract was
   essential to optimize the production, in terms of product concentration
   and productivity, of neutral lipids by C. laurentii 11. Under this
   optimized condition, the production of total lipids increased by 133\%
   in relation to control experiment (from 1.27 to 2.96 g L-1). The total
   lipids indicated a predominant (86\%) presence of neutral lipids with
   high content of 16- and 18-carbon- chain saturated and monosaturated
   fatty acids. This class of lipids is considered especially suitable for
   the production of biodiesel.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEURISTICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{143-164}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a heuristic algorithm to solve a new variant
   of the partial set covering problem. In this variant, each element e(i)
   has a gain gi (i.e., a positive profit), each set s(j) has a cost c(j)
   (i. e., a negative profit), and each set s(j) is part of a unique group
   G(k) that has a fixed cost f(k) (i. e., a negative profit). The
   objective is to maximize profit and it is not necessary to cover all of
   the elements. We present an industrial application of the model and
   propose a hybrid heuristic algorithm to solve it; the proposed algorithm
   is an iterated-local-search algorithm that uses two levels of
   perturbations and a tabu-search heuristic. Whereas the first level of
   perturbation diversifies the search around the current local optimum,
   the second level of perturbation performs long jumps in the search space
   to help escape from local optima with large basins of attraction. The
   proposed algorithm is evaluated on thirty real-world problems and
   compared to a memetic algorithm. Computational results show that most of
   the solutions found by ITS are either optimal or very close to
   optimality.}},

Abstract = {{The development of inorganic nanocrystals (NCs) based
   bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells provides an alternative way to
   harvest sunlight for energy conversion. BHJ solar cells attract
   significant interest due to their simple fabrication, low cost and high
   performance. Among all the inorganic NCs, Pb and Cd chalcogenide (PbX
   and CdX, X=S, Se or Te) NCs as electron acceptor materials theoretically
   improve the performance of BHJ solar cells due to their enhanced
   absorption and multiple exciton generation (MEG). However, their
   performance in BHJ solar cell devices still does not match with the BHJ
   solar cell devices made from phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester
   (PCBM). The initial part of this review introduces the concept,
   materials, structure, device fabrication, working principles and
   characterization of BHJ solar cells. Then, the different solution
   processed approaches and details on reported BHJ solar cell devices
   based on Pb and Cd chalcogenide NCs are summarized. Finally, critical
   factors limiting the performance of BHJ solar cell devices are discussed
   and strategies for the improvement of the power conversion efficiency
   (PCE) are demonstrated by presenting recent examples from literature.

Abstract = {{The laser-induced generation of vapor bubbles around gold nanoparticles
   (AuNPs) is a promising diagnostic and therapeutic avenue for various
   pathologies. The physical mechanism that leads to their formation
   strongly depends on the time regime of the irradiation. While the
   plasmonic nanobubbles induced by nanosecond and picosecond laser pulses
   are known to be triggered by the energy that is absorbed in the
   nanoparticles and diffused in the medium (thermo-mediated cavitation),
   we show that a different plasma-mediated mechanism occurs in the case of
   femtosecond pulses. In this paper, we present experimental evidence that
   the dimensions of laser-induced bubbles depend on the polarization of
   the incident laser pulse when the pulse duration is reduced below
   similar to 1 ps. This result cannot be explained by the standard
   thermo-mediated cavitation process and, thus, reveals the onset of a new
   mechanism in the ultrafast regime. We further show that the discrepancy
   between the dimensions of bubbles generated from linearly and circularly
   polarized laser pulses can be explained using a simple model, revealing
   the polarization cavitation dependence as a clear signature of the
   plasma mechanism. This paper presents in detail the transition between
   both cavitation regimes and provides insight into the precise control of
   the cavitation dynamics at the nanoscale.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces balanced location-allocation design problem to
   tackle a real-world health-care application. The problem involves
   strategic decisions on locating a predefined number of facilities and
   allocating a set of customers to the facilities such that minimizes
   total travel, operating and congestion costs in an uncertain
   environment. To face more appropriately with the uncertainties, a
   comprehensive model which takes into account all sources of uncertainty
   is proposed. Moreover, in order to have a balanced use of installed
   capacities and/or reduce delays in servicing, congestion-related costs
   are defined as a power-law function of the trespassed facility's
   operating capacity. The developed model is extremely hard to solve
   because of its inherently high combinatorial nature combined with the
   uncertainties and the nonlinearities associated to the congestion.
   Therefore, a new search mechanism based on variable neighborhood search
   is put forward. This algorithm employs both random and mathematical
   programming techniques to generate a set of initial solutions. On the
   other hand, to examine the quality of each move, a linear model which is
   scenario decomposable is extracted. The validation of the model is
   studied on an existing application, and the algorithm's performance is
   tested on a wide range of instances taken from literature.}},

Abstract = {{Due to an abundance of low cost waste-heat in the industrial and
   residential sector, many studies in recent years have focused on
   applications of low grade heat for local energy needs. These include
   heat reutilization, thermal conversion to mechanical energy and thermal
   conversion to electricity. The thermoelectric effect presents a
   promising potential for effective conversion of low grade waste-heat yet
   is currently limited in application due to a conversion efficiency that
   is not cost effective. The present work focuses on mechanical methods to
   improve the thermal tension driving the electromotive force responsible
   for thermoelectric power production. More specifically, flow impeding
   geometries are inserted into the flow channels of a liquid-to-liquid
   thermoelectric generator thereby enhancing the heat transfer near its
   embedded thermoelectric modules. Consequentially, the thermal dipole
   across the modules is increased improving the overall power output. Care
   is taken to measure the adverse pressure drop caused by the use of the
   flow impeding geometries in order to evaluate the net power output. This
   net thermoelectric power output is measured, reported and discussed for
   a fixed inlet temperature difference, a fixed electrical load, varying
   flow rates and varying insert geometries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A wireless power transmission (WPT) system based on a magnetically
   coupled coil-based resonance is the predominating technology in most WPT
   applications. In the field of implantable medical devices, however, the
   energy transfer operation is highly limited by the size of the receiver
   and also the loss properties of dispersive human tissue. Since the low
   gigahertz range has been considered as the optimal transfer frequency,
   an alternative to the lossy coil resonator should be studied and
   developed. In this paper, an original transmitter solution is presented
   that considers the needs for strong magnetic dominant near-field and
   weak far-field radiation even at low gigahertz frequency. A half-closed
   partially ceramic-filled cavity resonator is described on the basis of
   an accurate, but analytical model. Design parameters are also studied
   using a full-wave simulation software package and measurement results of
   a resonator-to-resonator transfer scheme are presented, which show a
   good agreement with simulation results. An efficiency above 65\% can be
   obtained within the distance comparable to the diameter of the resonator
   (60.5 mm) in this case study. Subsequently, energy transmission between
   the proposed cavity resonator and a small-sized copper coil of 3 mm of
   diameter is investigated. Measurement results show that the efficiency
   is above 34\% within 20 mm and above 8.2\% within 40 mm, which is much
   higher than the conventional coil-to-coil transmission scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Since the very beginning of RF and microwave integrated techniques and
   energy harvesting, Schottky diodes are most often used in mixing and
   rectifying circuits. However, in specific W power-harvesting
   applications, the Schottky diode technique fails to provide a
   satisfactory RF-dc conversion efficiency mainly because of its high
   zero-bias junction resistance. This paper examines the state-of-the-art
   low-power microwave-to-dc energy conversion techniques. A comprehensive
   picture of the state-of-the-art on this aspect is given graphically,
   which compares different technologies such as transistor, diode, and
   CMOS schemes. Subsequent to the highlighted limitations of current
   devices, this work introduces, for the first time, a nonlinear component
   for low-power rectification based on a recent discovery in spintronics,
   namely, the spindiode. Along with an analysis of the role of
   nonlinearity and zero bias resistance in the rectification process of
   the spindiode, it is shown how the spindiode could enhance the
   rectification efficiency even at a very low-power level and how this
   technique would shift the design paradigms of diode-based devices and
   circuits.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the development and demonstration of a
   high-efficiency rectifier for millimeter-wave-to-dc energy conversion.
   It is a critical circuit block that renders possible the use of a single
   CMOS chip die with no substrate and wiring, as the implementation of a
   batteryless, yet active tag for next-generation high data-rate
   millimeter-wave identification technologies. We also propose an
   architecture of a reader-tag system that addresses the underlying
   technical challenges. The rectifier is based on a differential drive
   cross-coupled topology that has been shown to work at UHF frequencies
   only so far. In this paper, we investigate significant challenges in
   implementing this topology at millimeter-wave frequencies with good
   power conversion efficiency (PCE). The analyses, design, and results
   presented in this work demonstrate the feasibility of achieving this by
   minimizing simultaneously the small on-resistance and the reverse
   leakage current in the MOS transistors, and by reducing losses and
   parasitic capacitances through proper transistor sizing and layout
   optimization. Using a standard 65-nm bulk CMOS process, a chip was
   designed, fabricated, and tested under different input and output
   loading conditions. The rectifier exhibits an overall PCE of 20\% at 24
   GHz, 18\% at 35 GHz, and 11\% at 60 GHz under RF available driving power
   of 6, 6, and 3 dBm, respectively, and output load resistance of 1, 1,
   and 2 k Omega respectively. These PCE performances at millimeter- wave
   frequencies have never been reported in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies optimization methods for a routing problem

   Stochastic service and travel times on road segments are considered. The
   problem is formulated as a variation of the capacitated arc routing
   problem (CARP). A chance-constrained programming model is firstly
   developed and solved by a branch-and-cut algorithm. A stochastic
   programming model with recourse is also proposed to take into account
   the recourse costs in case of route failure. The problem is solved by an
   adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm. The computational
   experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{This paper presents the effects of a continuous wave electromagnetic

   Susceptibility of the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) is first
   studied as a standalone circuit before being integrated into the PLL.
   The effects observed on the VCO alone and when it is integrated into the
   PLL are analyzed as a function of the frequency and power of the
   interference signal. Most of the effects observed are due to intrinsic
   nonlinearities of the VCO. Some of them, like intermodulation and
   injection pulling can be predicted by the small-signal perturbation
   theory, while others such as a phase unlocking condition generated by
   strong EMI injection cannot. Finally, the consequence of using such an
   EMI affected PLL used as a local oscillator in a QPSK receiver, is
   examined. In all cases, the EMI is injected at the output of the VCO
   through inductive coupling.}},

Abstract = {{Tests on animals of different species with large differences in
   intervertebral disc size are commonly used to investigate the
   therapeutic efficacy of intravenously injected solutes in the disc. We
   hypothesize that disc size markedly affects outcome.
   Here, using a small non-metabolized molecule, glucosamine (GL) as a
   model solute, we calculate the influence of disc size on transport of GL
   into rat, rabbit, dog and human discs for 10 h post
   intravenous-injection. We used transient finite element models and
   considered an identical GL supply for all animals.
   Huge effects of disc size on GL concentration profiles were found.
   Post-injection GL concentration in the rat disc reached 70 \% blood
   concentration within 15 min but remained below 10 \% in the human disc
   nucleus throughout. The GL rapidly penetrated post-injection into
   smaller discs resulting in homogeneous concentrations. In contrast, GL
   concentration, albeit at much lower levels, increased with time in the
   human disc with a small outward flux at the annulus periphery at longer
   periods.
   Changes in the disc size hugely influenced GL concentrations throughout
   the disc at all regions and times. Increases in administered dose can
   neither remedy the very low concentration levels in the disc center in
   larger human disc at early post-injection hours nor alter the
   substantial differences in concentration profiles estimated among
   various species. The size effect will only be exacerbated as molecular
   weight of the solute increases and as the endplate calcifies.
   Extrapolation of findings from animal to human discs on the efficacy of
   intravenously administered solutes must proceed with great caution.}},

Title = {{Uncertainty and spatial variability in characterization factors for

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{19}},

Pages = {{882-890}},

Abstract = {{Characterization factors (CFs) quantifying the potential impact of
   acidifying emissions on inland aquatic environments in life cycle
   assessment are typically available on a generic level. The lack of
   spatial differentiation may weaken the relevance of generic CFs since it
   was shown that regional impact categories such as aquatic acidification
   were influenced by the surroundings of the emission location. This paper
   presents a novel approach for the development of spatially
   differentiated CFs at a global scale for the aquatic acidification
   impact category.
   CFs were defined as the change in relative decrease of lake fish species
   richness due to a change in acidifying chemicals emissions. The
   characterization model includes the modelling steps linking emission to
   atmospheric acid deposition (atmospheric fate factor) change, which lead
   to lake H+ concentration (receiving environment fate factor) change and
   a decrease in relative fish species richness (effect factor). We also
   evaluated the significance of each factor (i.e. atmospheric fate,
   receiving environment fate and effects) to the overall CFs spatial
   variability and parameter uncertainty.
   The highest CFs were found for emissions occurring in Canada,
   Scandinavia and the northern central Asia because of the extensive lake
   areas in these regions (lake areas being one of the parameters of the
   CFs; the bigger the lake areas, the higher the CFs). The CFs' spatial
   variability ranged over 5, 6 and 8 orders of magnitude for NOx, SO2 and
   NH3 emissions, respectively. We found that the aquatic receiving
   environment fate factor is the dominant contributor to the overall
   spatial variability of the CFs, while the effect factors contributed to
   98 \% of the total parameter uncertainty.
   The resulting characterization model and factors enable a consistent
   evaluation of spatially explicit acidifying emissions impacts at the
   global scale.}},

Abstract = {{Ex vivo biomechanical testing of growth plate samples provides essential
   information about its structural and physiological characteristics.
   Experimental limitations include the preservation of the samples since
   working with fresh tissues involves significant time and transportation
   costs. Little information is available on the storage of growth plate
   explants. The aim of this study was to determine storage conditions that
   could preserve growth plate biomechanical properties. Porcine ulnar
   growth plate explants (n = 5 per condition) were stored at either 4
   degrees C for periods of 1, 2, 3, and 6 days or frozen at -20 degrees C
   with slow or rapid sample thawing. Samples were tested using stress
   relaxation tests under unconfined compression to assess five
   biomechanical parameters. The maximum compressive stress (sigma(max))
   and the equilibrium stress (sigma(eq)) were directly extracted from the
   experimental curves, while the fibril-network reinforced biphasic model
   was used to obtain the matrix modulus (E-m), the fibril modulus (E-f),
   and the permeability (k). No significant changes were observed in
   sigma(eq) and E-m in any of the tested storage conditions. Significant
   decreases and increases, respectively, were observed in sigma(max) and k
   in the growth plate samples refrigerated for more than 48 h and in the
   frozen samples, when compared with the fresh samples. The fibril modulus
   E-f of all stored samples was significantly reduced compared to the
   fresh samples. These results indicate that the storage of growth plates
   in a humid chamber at 4 degrees C for a maximum of 48 h is the condition
   that minimizes the effects on the measured biomechanical parameters,
   with only E-f significantly reduced. Refrigerating growth plate explants
   for less than 48 h maintains their maximal stress, equilibrium stress,
   matrix modulus, and permeability. However, cold storage at 4 degrees C
   for more than 48 h and freezing storage at -20 degrees C significantly
   alter the biomechanical response of growth plate samples. Appropriate
   growth plate sample storage will be beneficial to save time and reduce
   transportation costs to pick up fresh samples.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study was undertaken to develop an extension of

   using various confining stress levels. The applied confining pressures
   varied between 1.4 and 24MPa, corresponding to 3 and 54\% of the
   uniaxial compressive strength. Test results indicated that the increase
   in temperature and/or confining pressure lead to a significant change in
   the mechanical properties of concrete. Furthermore, the Mohr-Coloumb and
   Newman models did not provide good fitting of the experimental data
   obtained on concrete subjected to high temperature of up to 700 degrees

Abstract = {{Plaque rupture in atherosclerosis is the primary cause of potentially
   deadly coronary events, yet about 40\% of ruptures occur away from the
   plaque cap shoulders and cannot be fully explained with the current
   biomechanical theories. Here, cap buckling is considered as a potential
   destabilizing factor which increases the propensity of the
   atherosclerotic plaque to rupture and which may also explain plaque
   failure away from the cap shoulders. To investigate this phenomenon,
   quasistatic 2D finite element simulations are performed, considering the
   salient geometrical and nonlinear material properties of diverse
   atherosclerotic plaques over the range of physiological loads. The
   numerical results indicate that buckling may displace the location of
   the peak von Mises stresses in the deflected caps. Plaque buckling,
   together with its deleterious effects is further observed experimentally
   in plaque caps using a physical model of deformable mock coronary
   arteries with fibroatheroma. Moreover, an analytical approach combining
   quasistatic equilibrium equations with the Navier-Bresse formulas is
   used to demonstrate the buckling potential of a simplified arched
   slender cap under intraluminal pressure and supported by foundations.
   This analysis shows that plaque caps - calcified, fibrotic or cellular -
   may buckle in specific undulated shapes once submitted to critical
   loads. Finally, a preliminary analysis of intravascular ultrasonography
   recordings of patients with atherosclerotic coronary arteries
   corroborates the numerical, experimental and theoretical findings and
   shows that various plaque caps buckle in vivo. By displacing the sites
   of high stresses in the plaque cap, buckling may explain the
   atherosclerotic plaque cap rupture at various locations, including cap
   shoulders. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Several attempts have been made to measure geometrical torsion in
   adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) and quantify the three-dimensional
   (3D) deformation of the spine. However, these approaches are sensitive
   to imprecisions in the 3D modeling of the anatomy and can only capture
   the effect locally at the vertebrae, ignoring the global effect at the
   regional level and thus have never been widely used to follow the
   progression of a deformity. The goal of this work was to evaluate the
   relevance of a novel geometric torsion descriptor based on a parametric
   modeling of the spinal curve as a 3D index of scoliosis. First, an
   image-based approach anchored on prior statistical distributions is used
   to reconstruct the spine in 3D from biplanar X-rays. Geometric torsion
   measuring the twisting effect of the spine is then estimated using a
   technique that approximates local arc-lengths with parametric curve
   fitting centered at the neutral vertebra in different spinal regions. We
   first evaluated the method with simulated experiments, demonstrating the
   method's robustness toward added noise and reconstruction inaccuracies.
   A pilot study involving 65 scoliotic patients exhibiting different types
   of deformities was also conducted. Results show the method is able to
   discriminate between different types of deformation based on this novel
   3D index evaluated in the main thoracic and thoracolumbar/lumbar
   regions. This demonstrates that geometric torsion modeled by parametric
   spinal curve fitting is a robust tool that can be used to quantify the
   3D deformation of AIS and possibly exploited as an index to classify the
   3D shape.}},

Abstract = {{To explain the shear-thinning behavior of untreated carbon nanotube
   (CNT) suspensions in a Newtonian matrix, a new set of rheological
   equations is developed. The CNTs are modeled as rigid rods dispersed in
   a Newtonian matrix and the evolution of the system is controlled by
   hydrodynamic and rod-rod interactions. The particle-particle
   interactions is modeled by a nonlinear lubrication force, function of
   the relative velocity at the contact point, and weighted by the contact
   probability. The stress tensor is calculated from the known fourth-order
   orientation tensor and a new fourth-order interaction tensor. The
   Fokker-Planck equation is numerically solved for steady simple shear
   flows using a finite volume method. The model predictions show a good
   agreement with the steady shear data of CNTs dispersed in a Newtonian
   epoxy matrix as well as for suspensions of glass fibers in
   polybutene,(1) demonstrating its ability to describe the behavior of
   micro- and nanoscale particle suspensions. (c) 2013 American Institute

Abstract = {{This paper examines the pumping mechanisms generated by the Maxblend
   impeller. Simulation results obtained with the lattice Boltzmann method
   (LBM) are presented for Newtonian fluids (Re=2-140) and strongly
   shear-thinning fluids (Re-g=0.1-50) obeying the Carreau-Yasuda model
   with a very small power index (n=0.05). In the Newtonian case, the
   pumping numbers predicted by the LBM are shown to compare favourably to
   those obtained with the finite element (FEM) as well as to experimental
   data based on the decolourisation method. These results indicate a small
   pumping capacity in the deep laminar regime followed by its sharp
   increase in the transitional regime, a phenomenon which is explained by
   examining the flow field simulated with the LBM and the FEM and measured
   through PIV. In the case of the strongly shear thinning fluids, the
   impact of the rheology on pumping is investigated. The flow fields and
   so-called pumping volumes predicted with the LBM reveal, similarly to
   the Newtonian case, a change in the structure of the axial and
   (secondary) radial flow when the Reynolds number is increased. Viscosity
   contours suggest that this phenomenon is in fact related to the
   occurrence of zones with very different apparent viscosities, which
   explains the problematic flow patterns observed experimentally with the
   PIV.}},

Volume = {{136}},

Abstract = {{In this study, aeroelastic analysis of a spherical shell subjected to
   external supersonic airflow is carried out. The structural model is
   based on a combination of the linear spherical shell theory and the
   classic finite element method (FEM). In this hybrid method, the nodal
   displacements are found from the exact solution of shell governing
   equations rather than approximated by polynomial functions. Therefore,
   the number of elements chosen is a function of the complexity of the
   structure. Convergence is rapid. It is not necessary to choose a large
   number of elements to obtain good results. Linearized first-order
   potential (piston) theory with the curvature correction term is coupled
   with the structural model to account for pressure loading. The linear
   mass, stiffness, and damping matrices are found using the hybrid finite
   element formulation. Aeroelastic equations are numerically derived and
   solved. The results are validated using the numerical and theoretical
   data available in literature. The analysis is accomplished for spherical
   shells with different boundary conditions, geometries, flow parameters,
   and radius to thickness ratios. the results show that the spherical
   shell loses its stability through coupled-mode flutter. This proposed
   hybrid FEM can be used efficiently for the design and analysis of
   spherical shells employed in high speed aircraft structures.}},

Abstract = {{Nanocomposites based on isotactic polypropylene (iPP) and titanium
   dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticle containing 1-15 vol\% (4.6-45.5 wt\%) of the
   nanoparticle were prepared by the melt blending process. The effect of
   an anhydride-modified polypropylene as a compatibilizer on dispersion of
   TiO2 nanoparticles was assessed using SEM. TGA and DSC analysis were
   performed to study the thermal properties of the nanocomposites.
   Crystalline structures of iPP in the presence of TiO2 were analyzed by
   XRD. Mechanical properties of the nanoparticles were measured and a
   micromechanical analysis was applied to quantify interface interaction
   between the polymer and particle. SEM results revealed improvement of
   TiO2 particle dispersion by adding the compatibilizer. It was shown that
   the thermal stability and crystalline structure of the nanocomposite are
   significantly affected by the state of particle dispersion. TiO2
   nanoparticles were shown to be strong -nucleating agents for iPP,
   especially at concentrations less than 5 vol\%. Presence of the
   -structure crystals reduced the elastic modulus and yield strength of
   the nanocomposites. Micromechanical analysis showed enhanced interaction
   between organic and inorganic phases of the compatibilized

Title = {{High resolution measurement of internal full-field displacements and
   strains using global spectral digital volume correlation}},
Journal = {{OPTICS AND LASERS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{44-52}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Thanks to its ability to non-destructively access internal strains in
   materials, Digital Volume Correlation (DVC) is gaining growing interest
   from both experimental and theoretical mechanics communities. One
   important issue in the implementation of DVC is the considerable
   computational costs associated with the huge amount of data, which
   hinders the applications of the technique, especially for
   high-resolution displacement and strain measurements. In this paper, we
   propose an accurate global DVC approach based on a Fourier decomposition
   for the kinematic basis of the sought displacement field. The approach,
   referred to as IS-DVC, leads to an algorithm whose computational
   complexity is not considerably increased by increasing the number of
   Degrees of Freedom (DOE) of the kinematic basis, thus being
   computationally efficient using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
   Artificial experiments have been used to evaluate the uncertainties of
   IS-DVC at high resolutions. Especially, displacement fields of 3D
   composites with spherical and non-aligned ellipsoidal particles at small
   scales were reconstructed. Resulting measurements revealed close
   similarities in terms of strain heterogeneities throughout the volume
   with the benchmark strains. Furthermore, it was shown that, in the
   presence of a discontinuity, the measurement uncertainties are not
   significantly affected, except for regions surrounding the
   discontinuity, hence validating the robustness of the reconstructed
   displacement field at a large number of DOF. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{MAR 28}},
Abstract = {{Mechano-chemical coupling has been recently recognised as an important
   effect in various systems as chemical reactivity can be controlled
   through an applied mechanical loading. Namely, Belousov-Zhabotinskii
   reactions in polymer gels exhibit self-sustained oscillations and have
   been identified to be reasonably controllable and definable to the
   extent that they can be harnessed to perform mechanical work at specific
   locations. In this paper, we use our theoretical work of nonlinear
   mechanochemical coupling and investigate the possibility of providing an
   explanation of phenomena found in experimental research by means of this
   theory. We show that mechanotransduction occurs as a response to both
   static and dynamic mechanical stimulation, e. g., volume change and its
   rate, as observed experimentally and discuss the difference of their
   effects on oscillations. Plausible values of the quasi-stoichiometric
   parameter f of Oregonator model are estimated together with its
   dependence on mechanical stimulation. An increase in static loading, e.
   g., pressure, is predicted to have stimulatory effect whereas dynamic
   loading, e. g., rate of volume change, is predicted to be stimulatory
   only up to a certain threshold. Further, we offer a physically
   consistent explanation of the observed phenomena why some
   Belousov-Zhabotinskii gels require an additional mechanical stimulation
   to show emergence of oscillation or why ``revival{''} of oscillations in
   Belousov-Zhabotinskii reactions is possible together with indications
   for further experimental setups. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   Intrinsic optical imaging was used to measure oxy (HbO), deoxy (HbR) and
   total (HbT) hemoglobin concentration changes, laser speckle for cerebral
   blood flow (CBF) changes, and MRI for the BOLD signal. Older rats had
   smaller HbO (41\% smaller), HbT (50\%) and CBF (34\%) responses, but the
   temporal dynamics did not exhibit significant age differences. The ratio
   of CBV to CBF responses was also smaller in older adults, potentially

Abstract = {{Step-meandering instabilities can manifest during step-flow growth on
   vicinal surfaces {[}Bales and Zangwill, Phys. Rev. B 41, 5500 (1990);
   Pierre-Louis, D'Orsogna, and Einstein, Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 3661
   (1999)]. A phase diagram based on the various growth regimes of a
   vicinal surface allows us to study the impact of nucleation on these
   meanders and to predict a meandering instability caused by the
   nucleation and the coalescence of both islands and steps. Using an
   accelerated kinetic Monte Carlo method, we find that the coalescence of
   islands with steps produces large protrusions and deep ripples and that
   the resulting meandering instability is reinforced by the growth of the
   islands at almost the same positions from one monolayer to the other. A
   coarsening phenomenon occurs for the instability wavelength until mounds
   appear, favored by a large Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier. Such a meandering
   instability could be exploited for periodic self-assembly.}},

Title = {{Comparison of black water source-separation and conventional sanitation
   systems using life cycle assessment}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{45-57}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{The municipal sanitation system based on black water source-separation
   (BWS) is often advanced as a viable environmental alternative to
   conventional systems (CONV). However, current studies have not led to
   any formal conclusions on the environmental advantage of such a system.
   The objective of this study is to compare the environmental performances
   of BWS and CONV in terms of environmental damage using the life cycle
   assessment method. The functional unit is to ensure wastewater and
   kitchen refuse collection and treatment and by-product (digestate/sludge
   and biogas) recycling for one inhabitant for one year. The results show
   that BWS generates higher impact scores than CONV: 100\%, 89\%, 24\% and
   25\% more for the human health, ecosystem quality, climate change and
   resources indicators, respectively, when metal emission impacts from
   fertilizers are excluded. If metal emission impacts were accounted for
   the conclusions are reversed for human health and ecosystem quality. The
   exclusion of metal emission impacts from fertilizers for the
   interpretation of the results is based on acknowledged overestimation
   and high degree of uncertainty of (eco)toxicity impacts by existing
   assessment methods. However, even with such exclusion, the impact scores
   of both systems for the ecosystem quality indicator are still not
   significantly different because of the large contribution of metal
   emissions from the background data, which still remained in the
   inventory. Depending on the grid mix and organic fertilizer transport
   distance assumptions, the study conclusions may be inverted for the
   climate change and resources indicators, since BWS may obtain lower
   impact scores than CONV. The main contributors to BWS impact scores are
   ammonia emissions from applied digestate and digestate management
   (transport, storage and spreading). Suggestions for significant
   enhancements are required for BWS to attain better environmental
   performances than CONV. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Lines Using an In Silico Metabolomic Platform}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 14}},
Abstract = {{Monoclonal antibody producing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells have
   been shown to undergo metabolic changes when engineered to produce high
   titers of recombinant proteins. In this work, we have studied the
   distinct metabolism of CHO cell clones harboring an efficient inducible
   expression system, based on the cumate gene switch, and displaying
   different expression levels, high and low productivities, compared to
   that of the parental cells from which they were derived. A kinetic model
   for CHO cell metabolism was further developed to include metabolic
   regulation. Model calibration was performed using intracellular and
   extracellular metabolite profiles obtained from shake flask batch
   cultures. Model simulations of intracellular fluxes and ratios known as
   biomarkers revealed significant changes correlated with clonal variation
   but not to the recombinant protein expression level. Metabolic flux
   distribution mostly differs in the reactions involving pyruvate
   metabolism, with an increased net flux of pyruvate into the
   tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in the high-producer clone, either being
   induced or non-induced with cumate. More specifically, CHO cell
   metabolism in this clone was characterized by an efficient utilization
   of glucose and a high pyruvate dehydrogenase flux. Moreover, the
   high-producer clone shows a high rate of anaplerosis from pyruvate to
   oxaloacetate, through pyruvate carboxylase and from glutamate to
   a-ketoglutarate, through glutamate dehydrogenase, and a reduced rate of
   cataplerosis from malate to pyruvate, through malic enzyme. Indeed, the
   increase of flux through pyruvate carboxylase was not driven by an
   increased anabolic demand. It is in fact linked to an increase of the
   TCA cycle global flux, which allows better regulation of higher redox
   and more efficient metabolic states. To the best of our knowledge, this
   is the first time a dynamic in silico platform is proposed to analyze
   and compare the metabolomic behavior of different CHO clones.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{47}},

Abstract = {{The lattice Boltzmann modeling of immiscible multiphase flows needs to
   be further validated, especially when density variation occurs between
   the different flow phases. From this perspective, the goal of this
   research is to introduce the multiple-relaxation-time operator into a
   lattice Boltzmann model in order to improve its numerical stability in
   the presence of large density and viscosity ratios. Essentially, this
   research shows that the introduction of this operator greatly improves
   the numerical stability of the approach compared to the original
   single-relaxation-time collision operator. In many lattice Boltzmann
   research studies, multiphase lattice Boltzmann methods are validated
   using a reduced number of test cases, and unsteady flow test cases are
   frequently omitted before much more complex flow configurations are
   simulated. In this context, several test cases are proposed to evaluate
   the behavior of a lattice Boltzmann method for simulating immiscible
   multiphase flows with high density and viscosity ratios. These are: (1)
   two-phase Couette flow; (2) three-phase Laplace law; (3) three-phase
   Zalesak disk; (4) two-phase flow between oscillating plates; (5)
   two-phase capillary wave; and (6) the two-phase oscillating cylindrical
   bubble. The first two involve a steady regime, and the remaining four an
   unsteady regime.}},

Title = {{Energy-Optimal Electrical-Stimulation Pulses Shaped by the Least-Action
   Principle}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Electrical stimulation (ES) devices interact with excitable neural
   tissue toward eliciting action potentials (AP's) by specific current
   patterns. Low-energy ES prevents tissue damage and loss of specificity.
   Hence to identify optimal stimulation-current waveforms is a relevant
   problem, whose solution may have significant impact on the related
   medical (e. g. minimized side-effects) and engineering (e. g. maximized
   battery-life) efficiency. This has typically been addressed by
   simulation (of a given excitable-tissue model) and iterative numerical
   optimization with hard discontinuous constraints - e.g. AP's are
   all-or-none phenomena. Such approach is computationally expensive, while
   the solution is uncertain - e. g. may converge to local-only
   energy-minima and be model-specific. We exploit the Least-Action
   Principle (LAP). First, we derive in closed form the general template of
   the membrane-potential's temporal trajectory, which minimizes the ES
   energy integral over time and over any space-clamp ionic current model.
   From the given model we then obtain the specific energy-efficient
   current waveform, which is demonstrated to be globally optimal. The
   solution is model-independent by construction. We illustrate the
   approach by a broad set of example situations with some of the most
   popular ionic current models from the literature. The proposed approach
   may result in the significant improvement of solution efficiency:
   cumbersome and uncertain iteration is replaced by a single quadrature of
   a system of ordinary differential equations. The approach is further
   validated by enabling a general comparison to the conventional
   simulation and optimization results from the literature, including one
   of our own, based on finite-horizon optimal control. Applying the LAP
   also resulted in a number of general ES optimality principles. One such
   succinct observation is that ES with long pulse durations is much more
   sensitive to the pulse's shape whereas a rectangular pulse is most
   frequently optimal for short pulse durations.}},

Abstract = {{Semiconductor nanocomposites, which are composed of titanium dioxide
   (TiO2) nanorods, cadmium sulphide (CdS) nanoparticles (NPs), and Ni
   clusters, were synthesized. The following steps were adopted: (i)
   surfactant-capped TiO2 nanorods with controlled length were synthesized
   in an autoclave using oleic acid and amino hexanoic acid as surfactants.
   By using a ligand-exchange procedure, in which nitrosonium
   tetrafluoroborate (NOBF4) was used to replace the original surfactants,
   hydrophilic NOBF4-TiO2 nanorods were obtained; (ii) the resulting
   nanorods were deposited with CdS NPs and (iii) then deposited
   selectively with Ni clusters (as cocatalyst) on the nanocomposite
   surface. Under visible-light illumination of the nanocomposite, the
   generated electrons from the conduction band of CdS are transferred to
   TiO2 via TiO2/CdS interface, then to metallic Ni cluster. As a result,
   the electron hole separation was highly enhanced, leading to a
   Ni-TiO2/CdS nanocomposite with high photocatalytic performance for the
   production of hydrogen (H-2).}},

Abstract = {{Given a graph G, an integer k, and a cost c(uv) associated with all
   pairs uv of non-adjacent vertices in G, the robust graph coloring
   problem is to assign a color in \{1, ..., k\} to every vertex of G so
   that no edge has both endpoints with the same color, and the total cost
   of the pairs of vertices having the same color is minimum. We propose a
   branch-and-price algorithm for the solution of this problem. The pricing
   problem consists in finding a stable set of minimum total weight, and we
   propose both an exact and a heuristic algorithm for its solution.

   and 330 degrees C), and Mg-Sn-Zn (at 300 degrees C) ternary systems were
   determined by quenching experiments, electron probe micro-analyzer
   (EPMA), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The ternary isoplethal
   sections with constant 5 In and 10 Sn at.\% of Mg-In-Sn system, and 10
   Sn at.\% of Mg-In-Zn system were determined by differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC). No ternary compounds were found in the Mg-Sn-Zn and
   Mg-Sn-In isothermal sections. Critical evaluation and thermodynamic
   optimization of the Mg-Sn-In-Zn quaternary system were carried out using
   CALPHAD (Calculation of Phase Diagrams) technique. The Modified
   Quasichemical Model in the Pair Approximation (MQMPA) was used for
   modeling the liquid solution, which exhibits a high degree of
   short-range ordering behavior. The solid phases were modeled with the
   Compound Energy Formalism (CEF). All available and reliable experimental
   data were reproduced within experimental error limits. A self-consistent
   thermodynamic database was constructed for the Mg-Sn-In-Zn quaternary
   system, which can be used as a guide for Mg-based alloys development.

Abstract = {{A detailed physical investigation of the H-induced microstructural
   damage in (0001) AlN epitaxial layers at various implantation
   temperatures is presented. Cross-sectional transmission electron

   C, extended defects (nanocracks) were formed only within similar to 50
   nm region situated below the H-concentration peak in the damage band of
   width similar to 280 nm compared with lower implantation temperatures.
   This implantation temperature-dependent behavior of the microstructural
   damage decides the morphology of the top buckled surface. Various

   through Microfluidic Infiltration}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Microstructured composite beams reinforced with complex
   three-dimensionally (3D) patterned nanocomposite microfilaments are
   fabricated via nanocomposite infiltration of 3D interconnected
   microfluidic networks. The manufacturing of the reinforced beams begins
   with the fabrication of microfluidic networks, which involves
   layer-by-layer deposition of fugitive ink filaments using a dispensing
   robot, filling the empty space between filaments using a low viscosity
   resin, curing the resin and finally removing the ink. Self-supported 3D
   structures with other geometries and many layers (e.g. a few hundreds
   layers) could be built using this method. The resulting tubular
   microfluidic networks are then infiltrated with thermosetting
   nanocomposite suspensions containing nanofillers (e.g. single-walled
   carbon nanotubes), and subsequently cured. The infiltration is done by
   applying a pressure gradient between two ends of the empty network
   (either by applying a vacuum or vacuum-assisted microinjection). Prior
   to the infiltration, the nanocomposite suspensions are prepared by
   dispersing nanofillers into polymer matrices using ultrasonication and
   three-roll mixing methods. The nanocomposites (i.e. materials
   infiltrated) are then solidified under UV exposure/heat cure, resulting
   in a 3D-reinforced composite structure. The technique presented here
   enables the design of functional nanocomposite macroscopic products for
   microengineering applications such as actuators and sensors.}},

Title = {{Getting Information from Modal Decomposition of Grain Size Distribution
   Curves}},
Journal = {{GEOTECHNICAL TESTING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Soil samples may be difficult-to-identify mixtures of different layers.
   For environmental and groundwater projects, a detailed stratigraphy is
   needed because the coarse layers are highways for both water and
   dissolved contaminants. The paper proposes a method to decompose a grain
   size distribution curve (GSDC) into its 1, 2, or 3 log-normal components
   and their proportions. The proposed method can accurately decompose
   synthetic mixes of three lognormal modes, except when a mode contributes
   for less than about 2 \%. In such a case, it is suggested to ignore this
   mode and describe the mix as a two mode mix. An example is given for an
   experimental site with many split-spoon soil samples. The suspected
   stratification was confirmed by the decomposition method, which found
   mixtures of only two soil components, fine sand and clayey silt, each of
   them with little variability. The large-scale permeability, as provided
   by a pumping test, corresponds to the horizontally composed permeability
   of the soil components: thus, it confirms the adequacy of the soil
   sample decomposition method.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the electrical conductivity and percolation behavior of
   binary and ternary nanocomposites based on multiwalled carbon nanotubes
   (MWCNs) using polypropylene (PP) and a blend of PP with cyclic butylene
   terephthalate (CBT). The nanocomposites were prepared by diluting a
   commercial 20\% wtMWCNT PP masterbatch using optimized melt-mixing
   conditions. The concentration of carbon nanotubes in the diluted PP
   samples was as low as 0.5\% and as high as 15 \% in weight. For the
   PP/CBT blend CBT concentration was varied up to 40\% wt while the
   loading of CNT was from 0 to 5\% wt. SEM and TEM techniques were used to
   examine the quality of the dispersion and the formation of nanotube
   networks within the polymer matrix. TEM and Raman spectroscopy results
   showed that for the diluted PP/MWCNT composites the nanotubes are well
   aligned in samples obtained the microinjection molding process, although
   the level of alignment is less with crystalline PP than in an amorphous
   matrix such as polycarbonate (PC). FTIR and XRD results revealed that
   the orientation of both polymer chains and crystals decreased with the
   incorporation of nanotubes into PP. The electrical conductivity was also
   significantly altered by the nanotube alignment in a PP matrix, as was
   previously observed for PC/MWCNT composites; the conductivity decreased
   and the percolation threshold rose in highly sheared samples; however,
   the presence of a crystalline phase improved the conductivity even for
   high shear conditions through the phenomenon of double percolation
   threshold. This last concept refers to the requirement that the
   filler-rich phase be continuous and conductive and not to the existence
   of two percolation thresholds at two different CNT concentrations. The
   electrical conductivity of PP/CBT blends was also improved through a
   double percolation that is the basic requirement for the conductivity of
   the ternary nanocomposites.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL POLYMER PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{Seal strength behavior of low density polyethylene and ethylene vinyl
   acetate copolymer (PE/EVA) blends as well as that of blends of a seal
   grade PLA with aliphatic polyester (PCL) was studied. Polyethylene is
   commonly used for seal application in packaging multilayer structures
   and amorphous PLA is considered to be its counterpart for compostable
   and/or biodegradables ones. Incorporation of EVA in polyethylene
   improves its sealability in terms of a decrease in seal initiation
   temperature and broadness of sealability plateau. This was interpreted
   as due to the formation of finer crystals, a decrease in the melting
   point and presence of vinyl acetate polar group. These were supported by
   results obtained from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and
   Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). For the PLA/PCL system, the
   dispersed phase was stretched into elongated ellipsoidal domains. This
   type of morphology affected the mechanical and seal properties of the
   blends. As a result of blending, both hot-tack initiation temperature
   and strength as well as seal initiation temperature were enhanced. The
   enhancement in these seal properties was significant when the
   concentration of the dispersed phase exceeded 20 wt\% in the blend.
   Hot-tack strength of up to twice of pure PLA was achieved through
   blending. This was attributed to the lower glass transition temperature
   of PCL, resulting in enhanced mobility of PLA chains and also the high
   aspect ratio of the dispersed phase. The maximum obtained hot-tack
   strength (1200 g/25 mm) at 40\% dispersed content compared
   advantageously to commercially available polyolefin based sealant
   resins. The seal and hot-tack initiation temperatures were shifted to
   lower temperatures by as much as 30 degrees C, which can allow faster
   and more energy efficient sealing process.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The use of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-induced
   protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) fluorescence has shown promise as a surgical
   adjunct for maximizing the extent of surgical resection in gliomas. To
   date, the clinical utility of 5-ALA in meningiomas is not fully
   understood, with most descriptive studies using qualitative approaches
   to 5-ALA-PpIX.
   OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic performance of 5-ALA-PpIX
   fluorescence during surgical resection of meningioma.
   METHODS: ALA was administered to 15 patients with meningioma undergoing
   PpIX fluorescence-guided surgery at our institution. At various points
   during the procedure, the surgeon performed qualitative, visual
   assessments of fluorescence by using the surgical microscope, followed
   by a quantitative fluorescence measurement by using an intra-operative
   probe. Specimens were collected at each point for subsequent
   neuropathological analysis. Clustered data analysis of variance was used
   to ascertain a difference between groups, and receiver operating
   characteristic analyses were performed to assess diagnostic
   capabilities.
   RESULTS: Red-pink fluorescence was observed in 80\% (12/15) of patients,
   with visible fluorescence generally demonstrating a strong, homogenous
   character. Quantitative fluorescence measured diagnostically significant
   PpIX concentrations (c(PpIx)) in both visibly and nonvisibly fluorescent
   tissues, with significantly higher c(PpIx) in both visibly fluorescent
   (P < .001) and tumor tissue (P = .002). Receiver operating
   characteristic analyses also showed diagnostic accuracies up to 90\% for
   differentiating tumor from normal dura.
   CONCLUSION: ALA-induced PpIX fluorescence guidance is a potential and
   promising adjunct in accurately detecting neoplastic tissue during
   meningioma resective surgery. These results suggest a broader reach for
   PpIX as a biomarker for meningiomas than was previously noted in the
   literature.}},

Title = {{Antigorite-induced seismic anisotropy and implications for deformation

Abstract = {{The present study, which is a follow-up of the Journal of Geophysical
   Research paper by Ji et al. (2013a), provides a new calibration for both
   seismic and fabric properties of antigorite serpentinites. Comparisons
   of the laboratory velocities of antigorite serpentinites measured at
   high pressures with crystallographic-preferred orientation data measured
   using electron backscatter diffraction techniques demonstrate that
   seismic anisotropy in high T serpentinite, which is essentially
   controlled by the antigorite c axis fabric, is independent on the
   operating slip system but strongly dependent on the regime and magnitude
   of finite strain experienced by the rock. Extrapolation of the
   experimental data with both pressure and temperature suggests that V-p
   anisotropy decreases but shear wave splitting (Delta V-s) and V-p/V-s
   increase with increasing pressure in either cold or hot subduction
   zones. For a cold, steeply subducting slab, antigorite is most likely
   deformed by nearly coaxial flattening or trench-parallel movements,
   forming trench-parallel seismic anisotropy. For a hot, shallowly
   subducting slab, however, antigorite is most likely deformed by simple
   shear or transpression. Trench-normal seismic anisotropy can be observed
   when the subducting dip angle is smaller than 30 degrees. The
   geophysical characteristics of the Tibetan Plateau such as strong
   heterogeneity in Vp, Vs and attenuation, shear wave splitting and
   electric conductivity may be explained by the presence of strongly
   deformed serpentinites in lithospheric shear zones reactivated along
   former suture zones between amalgamated blocks, hydrated zones of
   subducting lithospheric mantle, and the crust-mantle boundary if the
   temperature is below 700 degrees C in the region of interest.}},

   a new intensification mechanism to thoroughly explore very large
   neighborhoods of elite solutions restricted using information from the

Volume = {{108}},

Abstract = {{Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) acquired with
   electroencephalography (EEG) is a relatively new non-invasive
   neuroimaging technique with potential for long term monitoring of the
   epileptic brain. Simultaneous EEG-fNIRS recording allows the
   spatio-temporal reconstruction of the hemodynamic response in terms of
   the concentration changes in oxyhemoglobin (HbO) and deoxy-hemoglobin
   (HbR) associated with recorded epileptic events such as interictal
   epileptic discharges (IEDs) or seizures. While most previous studies
   investigating fNIRS in epilepsy had limitations due to restricted
   spatial coverage and small sample sizes, this work includes a
   sufficiently large number of channels to provide an extensive bilateral
   coverage of the surface of the brain for a sample size of 40 patients
   with focal epilepsies. Topographic maps of significant activations due
   to each IED type were generated in four different views (dorsal,
   frontal, left and right) and were compared with the epileptic focus
   previously identified by an epileptologist.
   After excluding 5 patients due to the absence of IEDs and 6 more with
   mesial temporal foci too deep for fNIRS, we report that significant HbR
   (respectively HbO) concentration changes corresponding to IEDs were
   observed in 62\% (resp. 38\%) of patients with neocortical epilepsies.
   This HbR/HbO response was most significant in the epileptic focus region
   among all the activations in 28\%/21\% of patients. (c) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This article presents a detailed overview and the experimental
   comparison of 15 multi-objective design-space exploration (DSE)
   algorithms for high-level design. These algorithms are collected from
   recent literature and include heuristic, evolutionary, and statistical
   methods. To provide a fair comparison, the algorithms are classified
   according to the approach used and examined against a large set of
   metrics. In particular, the effectiveness of each algorithm was
   evaluated for the optimization of a multiprocessor platform, considering
   initial setup effort, rate of convergence, scalability, and quality of
   the resulting optimization. Our experiments are performed with
   statistical rigor, using a set of very diverse benchmark applications (a
   video converter, a parallel compression algorithm, and a fast Fourier
   transformation algorithm) to take a large spectrum of realistic
   workloads into account. Our results provide insights on the effort
   required to apply each algorithm to a target design space, the number of
   simulations it requires, its accuracy, and its precision. These insights
   are used to draw guidelines for the choice of DSE algorithms according
   to the type and size of design space to be optimized.}},

Abstract = {{As a special type of low-grade metamorphic rocks, slate has a wide
   distribution in China, which is limited between the layered shale and
   schist. The therefore the fine distinction of such transitional rocks by
   the anslysis of its seismic properties is thus very important and it
   will help for the study of the upper crust anisotropy. Measurements of
   P- and S-wave velocities (V-P and V-S) and their directional dependence
   (shear wave splitting and velocity anisotropy) of the slate samples from
   Bingzhongluo, Yunnan, were performed during both pressurization and
   depressurization in laboratory at hydrostatic confining pressures up 10
   to 600 MPa using the pulse transmission technique. Wave velocities in
   different directions were obtained (X is parallel to the stretching
   lineation, Y parallel to the foliation but perpendicular to the
   lineation, and Z normal to the foliation),and the V-p of the slate in
   X,Y and Z are 6.58, 6.46 and 5.91 km/s, respectively; with an arerage
   V-P value of 6.30 km/s. The mean Vs is 3.62 km/s, yielding V-P/V-S =
   1.74. The pressure dependence of P- and S-wave velocities, seismic
   anisotropy and shear wave splitting in the slate rocks were observed and
   analyzed in this paper, and their relationships have been described. For
   the samples, both the pressurization and depressurization
   (anisotropy-confinig) curves display a rapid, nonliner increase in
   velocity with pressure at low pressure which was caused by the closure
   of microcracks in samples with increasing hydrostatic pressure, and then
   increase slowly and linearly in velocity at high pressures which the
   lattice preferred orientation of the constituent minerals such as mica
   and actinolite became the main factor. The anisotropy of the V-P and V-S
   reached 13\% and 16\%, respectively. The seismic properties of the slate
   documented in this paper will help the development of geodynamics,
   earthquake monitoring, and resource exploration, and also provide an
   experimental basis for the fine distinction of lithology in the upper
   crust.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of P and Sr additions on the primary and eutectic phases in
   Al-15Si-14Mg-4Cu alloy were examined using thermal analysis and
   microstructural examination. With the addition of P, the primary Mg2Si
   particles were refined considerably, accompanied by a change in
   morphology from a coarse dendritic to a fine polygonal shape. Through
   the addition of Sr, eutectic Mg2Si and Si particle morphologies were
   also altered from coarse script-like and coarse acicular-type
   morphologies, respectively, to a fine fibrous form. Iron impurities in
   the alloy resulted in the formation of the pi-Fe phase (Al8Mg3FeSi6) in
   the structure, and the addition of Sr transformed the morphology of the
   pi-Fe from a script-like to a fine twin platelet form. The results show
   that addition of Sr or Sr + P reduces the eutectic temperature and
   reduces the size and therefore increases the number density of Mg2Si
   particles, Si and pi-Fe phases in the alloy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{We investigate the OPTEX reflector model for obtaining few-group
   reflector parameters consistent with a reference power distribution in
   the core. The reference power distribution is obtained using a 142
   872-region calculation defined over a two-dimensional eighth-of-core
   pressurized water reactor (PWR) and performed with the method of
   characteristics. The OPTEX method is based on generalized perturbation
   theory and uses an optimization algorithm known as parametric linear
   complementarity pivoting. The proposed model leads to few-group
   diffusion coefficients or P-1-weighted macroscopic total cross sections
   that can be used to represent the reflector in full-core calculations.
   These few-group parameters can be spatially heterogeneous in order to
   correctly represent steel baffles and thermal shields present in modern
   PWRs. The optimal reflector parameters are compared with those obtained
   with a flux-volume weighting of the reflector cross sections recovered
   from the reference calculation. Important improvements in full-core
   power distribution are observed when the optimal parameters are used.}},

Abstract = {{Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) and dynamic light scattering (DLS)
   were combined to characterize polyplexes formed with 10 kDa chitosan or
   10 kDa PEI and oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN). Combined analysis revealed
   that both polyplexes were highly porous (over 80\%) and that their
   weight average hydrodynamic diameters were of 46 and 55 nm for
   chitosan/ODN and PEI/ODN complexes, respectively. Transformation of the
   sedimentation coefficient distribution to a size and molecular weight
   distribution gave an average molecular weight of 19 and 29 MDa for
   chitosan and PEI polyplexes, respectively. Data from AUC also allowed
   for the calculation of the actual dn/dc and N/P ratios of each polyplex.
   Additional data from scanning electron microscopy and static light
   scattering confirmed the conclusions that were initially derived from
   AUC and DLS, thus validating that the combination of AUC and DLS is a
   powerful approach to characterize polyplexes in terms of refractive
   index increment, size, and molecular weight distributions, as well as

   microstrip ring antenna array (MRAA) is proposed and validated in
   low-cost substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) technology for Ka-band
   applications. The highly efficient, compact, and passive beam forming
   network (BFN) consists of SIW cruciform couplers as coupling unit, and
   its special topology is well adapted for feeding planar arrays. The
   wideband and high radiation efficiency antenna elements are
   aperture-coupled through slots etched on the top of a high permittivity
   SIW feed substrate. Such four antenna elements are used to construct 2 x
   2 MRAA and to form four fixed beams, one in each quadrant at an
   elevation angle of 20 degrees from the broad side array axis. A
   triangular grid arrangement is chosen to avoid grating lobes in the
   visible space. A 50-Omega grounded coplanar waveguide (GCPW) to SIW
   transition is used to avoid spurious input feed radiation loss. The
   array is measured to exhibit 3-dB beam width of 30 degrees in both of
   the orthogonal planes, radiation efficiency of 70\% for each port, and
   stable radiation pattern bandwidth of 7.6\% at 26.5 GHz. The physical
   size of the demonstrated 2 x 2 array is. 2.86 lambda(0) x 2.86 lambda(0)

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new compact monopole surrounded by four switched
   parasitic elements having the ability to work in the directional (beam
   steering) and omnidirectional modes is presented. The antenna is
   designed to operate over a 6\% bandwidth in the both modes. In the
   directional mode, the beam is steered in the azimuth plane and a
   front-to-back ratio greater than 10 dB is achieved over the bandwidth of
   interest. To steer the beam, the parasitic elements surrounding the
   driven element are connected and disconnected to the ground plane
   through switches. The performance of the antenna with both ideal and
   non-ideal switches is discussed based on the simulation and measurement
   results. To overcome the adverse effect of the non-ideal switch on the
   antenna radiation pattern and transmission coefficient, a transformer
   network is used in the switch circuit. It is shown that the accurate
   design of this transformer network can reduce the adverse effects
   significantly.}},

   low-dc-power millimeter-wave (MMW) down-conversion mixer with improved
   linearity using TSMC 90-nm CMOS low-power (LP) process. By employing an
   active load in the bias network, the linearity of the mixer can be
   improved effectively. In addition, the conversion gain (CG) of the mixer
   at high LO power is also improved, whereas the CG at low LO power is not
   appreciable degraded. The operation principle of the added active load
   and the impacts on mixer's linearity and CG are analyzed in detail. With
   a 1.2-V supply voltage and a 0-dBm LO drive power, the proposed mixer
   with the active load exhibits CG of 0 dB with flatness of +/- 2 dB from
   20 to 50 GHz, input P-1dB (IP1dB) of -1 dBm, and IIP3 of 9.5 dBm with RF
   at 43 GHz. The measured IIP3 is 5.6 dB higher than the conventional

Abstract = {{A compact single-layer substrate integrated wave-guide (SIW) monopulse
   network for Ku-band tracking system applications is investigated and
   demonstrated in this work. The feeding network and the monopulse
   comparator are integrated into a substrate with a structure size of 8.2
   lambda(0) x 9 lambda(0) at center frequency while 32 output ports are
   welded perpendicularly for connecting active transmit/receive modules.
   The optimal design of a 3-dB coupler with metallic slots and phase
   shifter with dual steps is presented. The relative frequency bandwidth
   (vertical bar S11 vertical bar, vertical bar S22 vertical bar, and
   vertical bar S33 vertical bar < 10 dB) of the network is 6\%, in which
   the phase imbalance of all ports is less than 5.5 degrees{[}root mean
   square (rms)], the power imbalance is about 0.5 dB (rms). The insertion
   losses are about 3-5 dB and the isolations between the three channels
   are all better than 25 dB. The good performances of this SIW-based
   monopulse network are validated by measurements, showing the advantages
   of low cost, light weight, easy fabrication, etc. It presents an
   excellent candidate for Ku-band tracking systems or up-band
   millimeter-wave systems.}},

Abstract = {{Successful bone tissue culture in a large implant is still a challenge.
   We have previously developed a porous hollow membrane sheet (HMSh) for
   tissue engineering applications (Afra Hadjizadeh and Davod
   Mohebbi-Kalhori, J Biomed. Mater. Res. Part A {[}2]). This study aims to
   investigate culture conditions and nutrient supply in a bioreactor made
   of HMSh. For this purpose, hydrodynamic and mass transport behavior in
   the newly proposed hollow membrane sheet bioreactor including a lumen
   region and porous membrane (scaffold) for supporting and feeding cells
   with a grooved section for accommodating gel-cell matrix was numerically
   studied. A finite element method was used for solving the governing
   equations in both homogenous and porous media. Furthermore, the cell
   resistance and waste production have been included in a 3D mathematical
   model. The influences of different bioreactor design parameters and the
   scaffold properties which determine the HMSh bioreactor performance and
   various operating conditions were discussed in detail. The obtained
   results illustrated that the novel scaffold can be employed in the
   large-scale applications in bone tissue engineering.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the effectiveness of seven ground motion scaling
   methods and two spectral matching methods to achieve compatibility with
   the Canadian National Building Code (CNBC) 2005 uniform hazard spectrum

   historical records and 30 Eastern North America simulated records have
   been selected to compute the reference mean seismic demand and its
   dispersion. The characteristics and destructive capacity of ground
   motions have been studied using a large number of indices computed from
   (i) the records themselves, (ii) a series of single degree of freedom
   structures, as well as (iii) a four-story steel frame. Record scaling
   methods to the target spectrum using (i) spectral intensity, (ii)
   reducing the mean square error, (iii) and minimizing dispersion as well
   as time domain spectral matching generated coherent seismic demand and
   dispersion in agreement with the reference values. Spectral matching to
   a specified elastic design spectrum does not reduce the dispersion of
   the nonlinear response. Therefore close spectral matching cannot be used
   to reduce the number of records to minimize the resources allocated in
   seismic safety assessment. At least seven records, as recommended in
   current CNBC and FEMA (2012) guidelines to compute an average response,
   should be used to characterize the nonlinear behaviour of structural

Journal = {{NDT \& E INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{29-39}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a new characterization technique to measure and
   quantify surface defects in composites. During manufacturing of
   composite sandwich parts, imperfections appear on the skins due to
   molding parameters such as temperature, pressure and humidity. Recurring
   imperfections observed on the surface of composites include surface
   porosities, resin shrinkage and gloss variation. Although several
   methods to characterize such defects were developed in the past, visual
   inspection remains widely used in the industry. In this paper, two
   different types of surface defects often encountered in the composite
   industry are measured: surface porosities and resin shrinkage. The
   proposed measurement method uses an optical system based on
   deflectometry. Unlike other methods, this technique provides real-time
   mapping of reflected light intensity. It also provides surface curvature
   variation which is the most relevant criterion for surface appearance
   analysis. The results further suggest that setting a threshold on a
   given parameter (e.g. total surface area of porosities per unit area of
   sample) and using a fully automated procedure would make this approach
   very efficient for quality control operations of composite parts. (C)

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATERIAL FORMING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{93-116}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Liquid Composite Molding (LCM) is an increasingly used class of
   processes to manufacture high performance composites. Engineering
   fabrics commonly used in LCM generally have a dual scale architecture in
   terms of porosity: microscopic pores exist between the filaments in the
   fiber tows, while macroscopic pores appear between the tows. Capillary
   flows in fiber tows play a major role on the quality of composites made
   by resin injection through fibrous reinforcements. This paper reports on
   an investigation on fabric imbibition characterization and subsequent
   evaluation of the optimal flow front velocity during resin injection
   through fibrous reinforcements. The goal is to devise more robust LCM
   processes and improve part quality. In order to evaluate a priori the
   injection conditions that minimize void formation, an impregnation model
   is developed based on imbibition characterization. This approach allows
   predicting the optimal front velocity without having to model complex
   dual scale flows through fibrous reinforcements and without performing
   expensive and time-consuming fabrication tests. After a summary of
   previous imbibition results obtained with a probe fluid, the optimal
   modified capillary numbers are computed by the new predictive model and
   the values are compared with results reported in the literature on void
   formation in LCM processes. Afterwards, capillary rise measurements are
   carried out with four infiltration fluids in order to evaluate the range
   of optimal flow front velocity that minimizes void formation. This
   characterization is implemented with vinyl ester resin, epoxy anhydride
   resin, styrene and anhydride. Finally, the optimal flow front velocity
   is evaluated for several fabric configurations.}},

Journal = {{NATURE MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{272-279}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Under the right conditions, cavity polaritons form a macroscopic
   condensate in the ground state. The fascinating nonlinear behaviour of
   this condensate is largely dictated by the strength of
   polariton-polariton interactions. In inorganic semiconductors, these
   result principally from the Coulomb interaction between Wannier-Mott
   excitons. Such interactions are considerably weaker for the tightly
   bound Frenkel excitons characteristic of organic semiconductors and were
   notably absent in the first reported demonstration of organic polariton
   lasing. In this work, we demonstrate the realization of an organic
   polariton condensate, at room temperature, in a microcavity containing a
   thin film of
   2,7-bis{[}9,9-di(4-methylphenyl)-fluoren-2-yl]-9,9di(4-methylphenyl)
   fluorene. On reaching threshold, we observe the spontaneous formation of
   a linearly polarized condensate, which exhibits a superlinear power
   dependence, long-range order and a power-dependent blueshift: a clear
   signature of Frenkel polariton interactions.}},

Abstract = {{CFD simulations of cross-flows along in-line and staggered tube bundles
   which emulate those encountered in the calandria of CANDU-6 reactors are
   presented. The knowledge of external wall temperature distributions
   around calandria tubes is a major concern during normal and off-normal
   operating conditions of CANDU reactors. Calculations are performed using
   the FLUENT software with several turbulence models using segregated and
   Coupled algorithms. It is observed that kappa-based models are able to
   reproduce mean velocities in staggered bundles. In most cases, the
   Coupled algorithm yields convergence even if it requires a longer
   computational time. Based on this work, the standard kappa-epsilon model
   is recommended to perform this kind of simulations. Improved
   kappa-epsilon models do not lead to better results while the kappa-omega
   model predicts very well the physics only around the first row but it is
   unable to predict the flow around tubes located far downstream in the
   bundle.}},

Abstract = {{Drinking water intake of arsenic (As) from private wells may represent a

   measured total As concentrations in hair and nails, and concentrations
   of the different species of As and its metabolites as well as 8-OHdG in
   urine of 110 non-smoking adults living in a rural region of the Province
   of Quebec, Canada. Significant differences in exposure biomarker levels
   were observed between individuals consuming drinking water with As
   levels of <= 1.0,> 1.0 - <= 10 and > 10 mu g/l. Multivariate linear
   regression analysis also showed a significant relationship between
   estimated daily drinking water intakes of As and biomarker levels.
   Conversely, 8-O HdG levels were not significantly related to daily
   drinking water intakes of As or to hair, nail or urinary exposure
   biomarker levels, according to multivariate linear regression analysis.
   Even at the relatively low levels of As found in well water of our
   participants, water consumption significantly increases their body load
   of As, as confirmed by multiple matrix measurements, which reflected
   exposure over different time frames. However, this increased internal As
   dose was not associated with higher oxidative damage to DNA as reflected

Abstract = {{Lead is neurotoxic at very low dose and there is a need to better
   characterize the impact of domestic sources of lead on the biological
   exposure of young children. A cross-sectional survey evaluated the
   contribution of drinking water, house dust and paint to blood lead
   levels (BLLs) of young children living in old boroughs of Montreal
   (Canada). Three hundred and six children aged 1 to 5 years and currently
   drinking tap water participated in the study. For each participant,
   residential lead was measured in kitchen tap water, floor dust,
   windowsill dust and house paint and a venous blood sample was analyzed.
   Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the association
   between elevated BLL in the children (>= 75th percentile) and indoor
   lead contamination by means of odds ratios (OR) using 95\% confidence
   intervals (Cl). There was an association between BLL 75th percentile
   (1.78 mu g/dL) and water lead when the mean water concentration was >
   3.3 mu g/L: adjusted OR = 4.7 (95\% Cl: 2.1-10.2). Windowsill dust
   loading > 14.1 mu g/ft(2) was also associated with BLL >= 1.78 mu g/dL:
   adjusted OR=3.2 (95\% Cl: 1.3-7.8). Despite relatively low BLLs, tap
   water and house dust lead contribute to an increase of BLLs in exposed
   young children.}},

Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{24-38}},

Abstract = {{The construction method used to build waste rock piles influences their
   internal structure. Commonly used methods typically lead to the creation
   of compacted material layers within otherwise loose, coarse-grained
   waste rock. These dense layers, which typically have a finer grain size,
   affect the movement and distribution of water inside the pile. Long-term
   numerical simulations of unsaturated flow in a large pile were conducted
   to investigate the effect of such layers. The simulations led to various
   observations that provide a better understanding of the hydrogeological
   behaviour of the modeled pile (based on an actual case). The results
   show how water distribution and seepage within the pile are influenced
   by the presence of these layers. Other factors, including the magnitude
   of precipitation (or recharge) and pile size, were also investigated.
   This article presents the main results of the simulations, with some
   comments on their practical implications for pile design.}},

Title = {{A semi-analytical method to generate g-functions for geothermal bore
   fields}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{641-650}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new methodology for the generation of thermal
   response factors of geothermal bore fields using the concept of
   g-functions introduced by Eskilson. Boreholes are divided into segments
   to consider the variation of the heat extraction rates along the length
   of the boreholes and the analytical finite line source (FLS) solution is
   used to calculate the temperature variations at the wall of each
   borehole segment along the axial direction. The proposed methodology
   accounts for the time variation of the heat extraction rates among
   boreholes and along the length of individual boreholes to obtain a
   uniform borehole wall temperature equal for all boreholes in accordance
   with the original boundary conditions proposed by Eskilson. In addition,
   the methodology is generalized to account for boreholes of different
   lengths and buried depths. g-Functions calculated with the proposed
   methodology are compared to the numerical technique used by Eskilson to
   derive the g-functions for fields of 1 to 12 x 12 boreholes. The
   difference between the two models is within 5\% for all studied bore
   fields, except for fields of boreholes located on a single row. The
   variation of the heat extraction rates of individual boreholes along
   their length as well as in time also showed good agreement with the
   numerical model. It is shown that using 12 borehole segments is adequate
   to calculate the g-functions in most practical cases. For instance, the
   error on the g-function of a 10 x 10 bore field calculated using 12
   borehole segments is 2.2\% after 20 years and 4.7\% at steady-state. (C)

Abstract = {{The standard procedure in Quebec, Canada, for evaluating the failure of
   an embankment dam, per the Loi sur la s,curit, des barrages, specifies a
   30-min-long failure scenario with a breach width equal to four times the
   maximal height of the dam. We demonstrate a new method for evaluating
   the flood overtopping failure scenario for embankment dams with concrete
   upstream slope protection, using Toulnustouc dam for example
   computations. Our new methodology computes safety factors for a range of
   potential failure mechanisms taking into account geotechnical,
   hydraulic, and structural factors. We compile the results of our
   investigations of the various dam failure mechanisms and compare the
   corresponding dam failure hydrographs to the current hydrograph
   specified in the standard analysis procedures. Our investigations tend
   to invalidate the current standard procedures for evaluating the failure
   of rock-fill dams with concrete upstream faces, by indicating that the
   current standard procedures underestimate the peak failure discharge and
   overestimate the time to the peak discharge.}},

Abstract = {{The paper addresses the optimal production control problems for an
   unreliable manufacturing system that produces items that can be regarded
   as conforming or nonconforming. A new stochastic hybrid state Markovian
   model with three discrete states, also called modes is introduced. The
   first two, operational sound and operational defective are not directly
   observable, while the third mode, failure, is observable. Production of
   defective parts is respectively initiated and stopped at the random
   entrance times to and departure times from the defective operational
   mode. The intricate, piecewise-deterministic dynamics of the model are
   studied, and the associated Kolmogorov equations are developed under the
   suboptimal class of hedging policies. The behavior of the model is
   numerically investigated, optimized under hedging policies, and
   subsequently compared to that of a tractable extension of the two-mode
   Bielecki-Kumar single machine model, where both conforming and defective
   parts are simultaneously produced in the operational mode, while the
   ratio of produced non conforming to conforming parts remains fixed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an analysis of flow parameters through a bottom

   A physical model of the regulating bottom outlet of Shahryar dam in Iran
   was used to investigate the hydraulic forces on the service radial gate
   and flow patterns within the conduit. The model was constructed from
   Plexiglas, and discharge and pressure data were recorded for different
   gate openings. The Froude law of similarity was satisfied in the
   hydraulic modelling, allowing for an investigation of the dynamic
   similarity of inertial and gravitational forces. The numerical scheme
   was based on using the natural-element method to study hydraulic forces
   and flow parameters within the conduit and the finite-element method to
   evaluate the natural frequencies of the radial gate. The results of the
   calculations for different radial gate openings showed good agreement
   with those from physical modelling for the pressure distributions

Title = {{A history-aware greedy channel restoration scheme for cognitive
   radio-based LTE networks}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL COMMUNICATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Pages = {{116-126}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Cognitive radio-based Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks benefit from
   the powerful features of cognitive Radios (CR), such as learning and
   reconfigurability, enabling them to perform, if required, channel
   switching to a channel with higher quality. This process of searching
   and sensing other channels is a restoration (recovery) process where the
   objective is to find the best channel in the shortest time. We propose
   in this paper a history-aware greedy restoration scheme triggered not
   only when the quality of the current operating channel of the user goes
   below a threshold, but at regular intervals. Based on the state of the
   current channel, our scheme computes the optimal number of channels to
   be sensed in this restoration period and this number is dynamically
   updated after each channel sensing result. Intrinsic features of
   learning and history-awareness of CRs are used to create the list of
   channels to be sensed based on the channels' background and historical
   information. The sensing order improves the restoration mechanism by
   providing a shorter restoration time or a restored channel with a higher
   quality. We show that the proposed combined scheme provides improvements
   for the CR-based LTE network's throughput, compared to other restoration
   schemes which work based on only greediness or history-awareness. (C)

Journal = {{SOCIO-ECONOMIC PLANNING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{89-103}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Benchmarking methods, primarily non-parametric techniques such as Data
   Envelopment Analysis, have become well-established and informative tools
   for economic regulation, in particular in energy infrastructure
   regulation. The axiomatic features of the non-parametric methods
   correspond closely to the procedural and economic criteria for good
   practice network regulation. However, critique has been voiced against
   the robustness of best-practice regulation in presence of uncertainty
   regarding model specification, data definition and collection. Incorrect
   data may result from structural sources, such as heterogeneous
   technologies; deterministic approaches applied to stochastic data
   generation processes or poorly defined scope of activity. Specifically
   within regulation, reporting may also be biased through individual
   gaming or collusive behavior, including the intentional provision of
   absurd data in order to stall or perturb regulatory process (here called
   maverick reporting). We review three families of outlier detection
   methods in terms of their function and application using a data set from
   Swedish electricity distribution, illustrating the different types of
   outliers, contrasting with the actual analysis ex post. This paper
   investigates the foundation of the critique both conceptually and by
   describing the actual state-of-the-art used in energy network regulation
   using frontier analysis models in Sweden (2000-2003) and in Germany
   (2007-). Finally, the paper concludes on the role of outlier detection
   as a mean to implement regulation with higher robustness. (C) 2013

Title = {{Initial versus tangent stiffness-based Rayleigh damping in inelastic

Journal = {{EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING \& STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{467-484}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In the inelastic time history analyses of structures in seismic motion,
   part of the seismic energy that is imparted to the structure is absorbed
   by the inelastic structural model, and Rayleigh damping is commonly used
   in practice as an additional energy dissipation source. It has been
   acknowledged that Rayleigh damping models lack physical consistency and
   that, in turn, it must be carefully used to avoid encountering
   unintended consequences as the appearance of artificial damping. There
   are concerns raised by the mass proportional part of Rayleigh damping,
   but they are not considered in this paper. As far as the stiffness
   proportional part of Rayleigh damping is concerned, either the initial
   structural stiffness or the updated tangent stiffness can be used. The
   objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive comparison of
   these two types of Rayleigh damping models so that a practitioner (i)
   can objectively choose the type of Rayleigh damping model that best fits
   her/his needs and (ii) is provided with useful analytical tools to
   design Rayleigh damping model with good control on the damping ratios
   throughout inelastic analysis. To that end, a review of the literature
   dedicated to Rayleigh damping within these last two decades is first
   presented; then, practical tools to control the modal damping ratios
   throughout the time history analysis are developed; a simple example is
   finally used to illustrate the differences resulting from the use of
   either initial or tangent stiffness-based Rayleigh damping model.

Abstract = {{The generalized vehicle routing problem (GVRP) involves finding a
   minimum-length set of vehicle routes passing through a set of clusters,
   where each cluster contains a number of vertices, such that the tour
   includes exactly one vertex from each cluster and satisfies capacity

   vehicles is a decision variable. This paper introduces a new
   mathematical formulation based on a two-commodity flow model. We solve
   the problem using a branch-and-cut algorithm and a metaheuristic that is
   a hybrid of the greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) and
   the evolutionary local search (ELS) proposed in {[}18]. We perform
   computational experiments on instances from the literature to

Abstract = {{Surface functionalization is an important process that has been adopted
   to well explore the applications of nanomaterials. In this context, we
   demonstrate the sodium functionalized graphene oxide (NaGO) as an
   excellent candidate for increasing the life time of titanium (Ti) based
   ortho-implants. As-prepared aqueous dispersion of NaGO was used to
   assemble NaGO sheets on commercially pure Ti (CpTi) plates by heat
   controlled spin coating. The resulting wrinkled NaGO sheets play a dual
   role in implant material, i.e., passive layer against corrosion and
   biocompatible scaffold for cell viability. The preparation,
   physicochemical properties, and biocompatibility of NaGO coatings formed
   on CpTi were reported. The electrochemical polarization studies
   demonstrate the relative susceptibility of control GO and NaGO coatings
   to corrosion, which outline that the NaGO coating act as a geometric
   blocking layer and hence prevent the implant surface from contacting
   corrosive media. The immunofluorescence and cell proliferation studies
   performed using human dermal fibroblasts cells showed that NaGO coatings
   significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced the cellular viability for longer in
   vitro culture period (15 days) than control GO and pristine CpTi. (C)

   following the code response spectrum procedure were compared with the
   results from inelastic response history analyses to investigate the
   effect of higher modes on seismic force demands. The results indicate
   that current code provisions for MD shear walls need to be modified. A
   new base shear factor and shear force design envelop are proposed to
   evaluate the seismic shear force demand more realistically. This study
   also recommends that the current CSA 23.3-04 requirements for ductile

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate heuristics for Approximate Graph Matching
   (AGM), in particular when it can be formulated as a Maximum Common Edge
   Subgraph (MCES) problem. First, we observe empirically that initializing
   a local search with a tiny subset of a known optimal solution always
   results in much better solutions than starting with an empty solution.
   The main challenge could then be to retrieve such small subsets for any
   problem instance. For this purpose, we propose several local similarity
   measures and evaluate their ability to predict node matches which could
   be used to start a local search. The resulting algorithm (SIM-T) is a
   classic tabu algorithm that is initialized by a greedy procedure relying
   mainly, in its earliest steps, on similarity measures.
   We conducted experiments on a large collection of random graphs of
   various orders (from 50 to 3000 nodes) and densities. Results obtained
   are mostly excellent, especially on similar pairs of labeled graphs.
   Comparisons made with two recent state-of-the-art algorithms - ``BP{''}
   and ``PATH{''} - indicate a superiority of our approach, in terms of
   both scores and computation times. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{FEB 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: PSEUDOMARKER is a software package that performs joint
   linkage and linkage disequilibrium analysis between a marker and a
   putative disease locus. A key feature of PSEUDOMARKER is that it can
   combine case- controls and pedigrees of varying structure into a single
   unified analysis. Thus it maximizes the full likelihood of the data over
   marker allele frequencies or conditional allele frequencies on disease
   and recombination fraction.
   Results: The new version 2.0 uses the software package NOMAD to maximize
   likelihoods, resulting in generally comparable or better optima with
   many fewer evaluations of the likelihood functions.
   Conclusions: After being modified substantially to use modern
   optimization methods, PSEUDOMARKER version 2.0 is more robust and
   substantially faster than version 1.0. NOMAD may be useful in other
   bioinformatics problems where complex likelihood functions are
   optimized.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we investigate the Resilient Multi-level Hop-constrained
   Network Design (RMHND) problem, which consists of designing hierarchical
   telecommunication networks, assuring resilience against random failures

   formulations are proposed and algorithms based on the proposed
   formulations are evaluated. A Branch-and-price algorithm, which is based
   on a delayed column generation approach within a Branch-and-bound
   framework, is proven to work well, finding optimal solutions for
   practical telecommunication scenarios within reasonable time.
   Computational results show that algorithms based on the compact
   formulations are able to prove optimality for instances of limited size
   in the scenarios of interest while the proposed Branch-and-price

Abstract = {{In industrial processes, heat is transferred from the heating utilities
   to the environment or converted to another form of energy. Process
   operations and heat exchanges decrease the energy quality, i.e. the heat
   is cascaded to lower temperatures. This paper focuses on the energy
   retrofit analysis by screening the transfer of energy across process
   operations and heat exchangers. A new conceptual diagram is proposed to
   capture the flow rate of heat transferred from the heating utilities to
   the environment through each heat exchanger and process operation as a
   function of temperature. The diagram considers heat savings by retrofit
   of the process units and the heat exchanger network (HEN), which was not
   fully addressed by previous methods. As an example of application, the
   diagram is used to identify heat saving modifications in a furfural
   process, alone or hosted in a kraft pulp mill. The heat consumption in
   the furfural process alone can be reduced by 40\% by two modifications
   in the HEN; the net heat consumption in the furfural process hosted in a
   kraft pulp mill can be reduced by 60\%-84\% with a few simple
   modifications in the HEN and process operations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Solvent-cast printing is a highly versatile microfabrication technique
   that can be used to construct various geometries such as filaments,
   towers, scaffolds, and freeform circular spirals by the robotic
   deposition of a polymer solution ink onto a moving stage. In this work,
   we have performed a comprehensive characterization of the solvent-cast
   printing process using polylactide (PLA) solutions by analyzing the flow
   behavior of the solutions, the solvent evaporation kinetics, and the
   effect of process-related parameters on the crystallization of the
   extruded filaments. Rotational rheometry at low to moderate shear rates
   showed a nearly Newtonian behavior of the PLA solutions, while capillary
   flow analysis based on process-related data indicated shear thinning at
   high shear rates. Solvent vaporization tests suggested that the internal
   diffusion of the solvent through the filaments controlled the solvent
   removal of the extrudates. Different kinds of three-dimensional (3D)
   structures including a layer-by-layer tower, nine-layer scaffold, and
   freeform spiral were fabricated, and a processing map was given to show
   the proper ranges of process-related parameters (i.e., polymer content,
   applied pressure, nozzle diameter, and robot velocity) for the different
   geometries. The results of differential scanning calorimetry revealed
   that slow solvent evaporation could increase the ability of PLA to
   complete its crystallization process during the filament drying stage.
   The method developed here offers a new perspective for manufacturing
   complex structures from polymer solutions and provides guidelines to
   optimize the various parameters for 3D geometry fabrication.}},

Abstract = {{Water distribution networks (WDN) are traditionally designed without
   integrating tanks in the optimization process, despite the numerous
   benefits tanks bring to network operation. Since 2004, a number of
   efforts have been made to integrate tanks, and especially consideration

   limitations in these models have impeded their adoption. This paper
   reviews different approaches to including tank consideration in WDN
   optimization, and examines the gap between proposed models and current
   engineering practice. It then analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of
   these models and suggests a procedure for selecting the most suitable
   approach to real-world WDN optimization projects. Further research is
   proposed to improve the validity and applicability of models to decision
   makers and policymakers.}},

Abstract = {{Triaxial compression deformation experiments on Carrara marble were
   performed in a Paterson gas-medium apparatus at a confining pressure of
   300MPa, temperatures of 873 similar to 1173K, and strain rates of ca.
   10(-6) similar to 10(-3) s(-1). The experimental results show that at a
   constant strain rate, the strength of Carrara marble decreases as
   temperature increases. At a constant temperature, the strength increases
   rapidly and then slowly with strain rate increasing. In the log-log plot
   of strain rate vs. differential stress, we find the slopes of the fitted
   lines for constant-temperature experimental data decrease with
   increasing temperature and the data for experiments at 873K and for
   experiments of high strain rates at 973K, best fit the exponential
   relationship. The results at high temperatures (e. g., 1073K, and 1173K)
   and the results for lower strain rates at 973K, however, best fit the
   power law relationship with a stress exponent about 5.3 similar to 7.7.
   Therefore, we can draw that there are two main deformation mechanisms of
   Carrara marble in our laboratory experiments, one of which is
   represented by the exponential relationship for high stresses and the
   other is the power law mechanism for moderate stresses.}},

Title = {{Subchondral chitosan/blood implant-guided bone plate resorption and

   microdrill holes in aged rabbit knees}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Little is known of how to routinely elicit hyaline cartilage
   repair tissue in middle-aged patients. We tested the hypothesis that in
   skeletally aged rabbit knees, microdrill holes can be stimulated to
   remodel the bone plate and induce a more integrated, voluminous and
   hyaline cartilage repair tissue when treated by subchondral
   chitosan/blood implants.
   Design: New Zealand White rabbits (13 or 32 months old, N = 7) received
   two 1.5 mm diameter, 2 mm depth drill holes in each knee, either left to
   bleed as surgical controls or press-fit with a 10 kDa (distal hole: 10K)
   or 40 kDa (proximal hole: 40K) chitosan/blood implant with fluorescent
   chitosan tracer. Postoperative knee effusion was documented. Repair
   tissues at day 0 (N = 1) and day 70 post-surgery (N = 6) were analyzed
   by micro-computed tomography, and by histological scoring and
   histomorphometry (Saf0, Col-2, and Col-1) at day 70.
   Results: All c-hitosan implants were completely cleared after 70 days,
   without increasing transient postoperative knee effusion compared to
   controls. Proximal control holes had worse osteochondral repair than
   distal holes. Both implant formulations induced bone remodeling and
   improved lateral integration of the bone plate at the hole edge. The 40K
   implant inhibited further bone repair inside 50\% of the proximal holes,
   while the 10K implant specifically induced a ``wound bloom{''} reaction,
   characterized by decreased bone plate density in a limited zone beyond
   the initial hole edge, and increased woven bone (WB) plate repair inside
   the initial hole (P = 0.016), which was accompanied by a more voluminous
   and hyaline cartilage repair (P < 0.05 vs control defects).
   Conclusion: In a challenging aged rabbit model, bone marrow-derived
   hyaline cartilage repair can be promoted by treating acute drill holes
   with a biodegradable subchondral implant that elicits bone plate
   resorption followed by anabolic WB repair within a 70-day repair period.

Abstract = {{The study presented here focuses on the use of monolayer covers for
   reclaiming two acid-generating tailings sites located in Quebec, Canada.
   One of these covers is made of non-acid-generating tailings, and the
   other is made of a silty sand (till). The covers are part of the closure
   plans that aim at controlling acidmine (rock) drainage at these two
   sites. Reactive tailings and cover material samples were collected in
   situ and characterised in the laboratory. Large-size columns (230 cm in
   height) were set up to evaluate the hydrogeological and geochemical
   response of the tailings and cover systems. Monthly wetting and drying
   cycles were repeated over nearly 2 years to simulate climatic
   conditions. Water content, suction, and oxygen concentrations were
   monitored, and chemical analyses were performed on the leachate
   collected at the base during each cycle to follow the evolution of water
   quality, in terms of pH and concentrations of sulfates and metals. In
   addition, small columns (45 cm in height) were also set up, with a
   similar testing program, to assess the hydrogeochemical behaviour of
   exposed tailings. The specific objective of this experimental program
   was to evaluate the hydrogeological and geochemical behaviour of the
   tailings-cover systems under controlled conditions. The results indicate
   that, for the imposed conditions, the monolayer covers became
   significantly desaturated, thus insufficiently limiting the oxygen
   diffusion flux. Consequently, these covers do not efficiently prevent
   sulfide oxidation within the tailings. The implications of these results
   are also discussed.}},

   considered the formation of the main pyrolysis products, condensable
   gas, non-condensable gas, and remaining solid, taking into consideration
   each as an individual lump. The second model investigated the liquid
   product while dividing the condensable gas into oil and water products.
   The oil product contains only chemicals, whereas the water product does
   not contain any chemicals. In the third model, the oil product was
   separated into four main groups: (1) phenolics, which contain all of the
   identified phenolic components using a gas chromatography mass
   spectrometry (GC MS) analyzer, (2) heavy-molecular-weight components,
   which contain all of the identified heavy-molecular-weight and undefined
   components, using GC MS, (3) non-phenolic aromatics with a single ring,
   and (4) aliphatics. The comparison of the predicted results using the
   estimated kinetic parameters to the experimental data showed the high
   capability of the presented models to estimate the product yield under
   the selected conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Recent data confirm that the power consumption of the information and
   communications technologies (ICT) and of the Internet itself can no
   longer be ignored, considering the increasing pervasiveness and the
   importance of the sector on productivity and economic growth. Although
   the traffic load of communication networks varies greatly over time and
   rarely reaches capacity limits, its energy consumption is almost
   constant. Based on this observation, energy management strategies are
   being considered with the goal of minimizing the energy consumption, so
   that consumption becomes proportional to the traffic load either at the
   individual-device level or for the whole network. The focus of this
   paper is to minimize the energy consumption of the network through a
   management strategy that selectively switches off devices according to
   the traffic level. We consider a set of traffic scenarios and jointly
   optimize their energy consumption assuming a per-flow routing. We
   propose a traffic engineering mathematical programming formulation based
   on integer linear programming that includes constraints on the changes
   of the device states and routing paths to limit the impact on quality of
   service and the signaling overhead. We show a set of numerical results
   obtained using the energy consumption of real routers and study the
   impact of the different parameters and constraints on the optimal energy
   management strategy. We also present heuristic results to compare the
   optimal operational planning with online energy management operation.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical model is developed to estimate the two-phase damping ratio
   for upward cross-flow through horizontal tube bundles. The present model
   is formulated based on Feenstra's model (2000) for void fraction and
   various models (homogeneous, Levy, Martinelli-Nelson and Marchaterre)
   for two-phase friction multiplier. The analytical results of drag
   coefficient on a cylinder and two-phase Euler number are compared with
   the experimental results by Sim-Mureithi (2013). The correlation factor
   between frictional pressure drop and the hydraulic drag coefficient is
   evaluated by considering the experimental results. The two-phase damping
   ratios given by the analytical model are compared with existing
   experimental results. The model based on Marchaterre's model is suitable
   for air-water mixture, whereas the Martinelli-Nelson's model is suitable
   for steam-water and Freon mixtures. The two-phase damping ratio is
   independent of pitch mass flux for air-water mixture, but is more or
   less influenced by the mass flux for steam-water/Freon (134) mixtures.
   The two-phase damping ratios given by the present model agree well with
   experimental results for a wide range of pitch mass ratio, quality, and
   p/d ratios.}},

Abstract = {{Microwave pyrolysis of lignin, an aromatic polymer byproduct from
   paper-pulping industry, produces char, gases, and lignin pyrolysis oil.
   Within the oil are valuable phenolic compounds such as phenol, guaiacol
   and catechol. In this work, we describe a method using switchable
   hydrophilicity solvents (SHS) to extract phenols as a mixture from
   lignin microwave-pyrolysis oil at the scale of 10 g of bio-oil. Even at
   this small scale, losses are small; 96\% of the bio-oil was recovered in
   its three fractions, 72\% of guaiacol and 70\% of 4-methylguaiacol, the
   most abundant phenols in the bio-oil, were extracted and 91\% of the
   solvent SHS was recovered after extraction. The starting material
   (lignin microwave-pyrolysis oil) and the three fractions resulted from
   SHS extraction were characterized by GC-MS and quantitative C-13\{H-1\}
   and P-31\{H-1\} NMR spectroscopy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The increasing presence of potentially toxic cyanobacterial blooms in

   (DWTPs) has been reported worldwide. The objectives of this study are to
   validate the application of in vivo probes for the detection and
   management of cyanobacteria breakthrough inside DWTPs, and to verify the
   possibility of treatment adjustment based on intensive real-time
   monitoring. In vivo phycocyanin YSI probes were used to monitor the fate
   of cyanobacteria in raw water, clarified water, filtered water, and
   chlorinated water in a full scale DWTP. Simultaneous samples were also
   taken for microscopic enumeration. The in vivo probe was successfully
   used to detect the incoming densities of high cyanobacterial cell number
   into the clarification process and their breakthrough into the filtered
   water. In vivo probes were used to trace the increase in floating cells
   over the clarifier, a robust sign of malfunction of the
   coagulation-sedimentation process. Pre-emptive treatment adjustments,
   based on in vivo probe monitoring, resulted in successful removal of
   cyanobacterial cells. The field results on validation of the probes with
   cyanobacterial bloom samples showed that the probe responses are highly
   linear and can be used to trigger alerts to take action.}},

Abstract = {{An approach for the bandwidth enhancement of a polarization rotating
   frequency selective surface (FSS) based on the substrate integrated
   waveguide (SIW) technology is proposed in this communication. Compared
   with the previously reported polarization rotating FSS, the pass-band
   bandwidth of the proposed FSS is enhanced from 4.6\% to 7.2\% by
   introducing a triple-mode SIW cavity resonator as the periodic element.
   Meanwhile, better frequency response selectivity of filtering
   performance is achieved. The proposed FSS is made up of a periodic array
   of the novel triple-mode SIW cavity resonators with two orthogonal slots
   on the front and back surfaces for polarization rotation. The
   triple-mode SIW cavity resonator is achieved by placing a metallic via
   at the center of a dual-mode SIW cavity resonator. Bandwidth enhancement
   of the FSS is achieved by simultaneously exciting and properly merging
   together these three modes in the SIW cavity resonator. A prototype
   designed at K alpha-band was fabricated and measured. Good agreement
   between the measurement and simulation results has been achieved.}},

Abstract = {{An improved finite difference time-domain (FDTD) method based on the
   telegraph equations of transmission lines is proposed. The original
   time-domain simulation method that resembles the well-established FDTD
   scheme based on the Maxwell's equations has been used in this paper to
   tackle the modeling problems of buried and overhead transmission lines.
   In this paper, a group of time domain responses of the ground impedance
   or ground admittance can be extracted analytically by means of a
   correlation between the ground impedance and the ground admittance.
   Thanks to the analytical technique, the accuracy of this time-domain
   solution is improved significantly. As a result, the application of this
   time-domain algorithm can be greatly expanded beyond the modeling of
   common transmission lines. By combining with the shunt and series
   connection difference equations, the method can be used to analyze an
   entire buried grounding network. Because the correlation between the
   ground impedance and the ground admittance is related to the propagation
   constant of electromagnetic waves, the analytical technique makes the
   propagation velocity unchanged during the iterative calculation.
   Therefore, the improved FDTD method allows the grounding network to be
   analyzed more accurately and efficiently.}},

Journal = {{SOLAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{50-65}},

Abstract = {{Building-integrated photovoltaics with thermal energy recovery (BIPV/T)
   shows great potential for integration into net-zero energy buildings.
   This technology is still not widely used, however. One of the reasons is
   that its advantages compared to traditional PV modules and solar thermal
   collectors are unclear. This study addresses the lack of a methodology
   on how to perform such comparison. It also presents a case study on how
   this novel approach can be used to demonstrate the actual energy and
   economic benefits of BIPV/T air systems compared to side-by-side PV
   modules and solar thermal collectors for residential applications. In
   this methodology, the thermal energy produced by both systems is
   transferred into water using a heat exchanger and the concept of annual
   equivalent useful thermal energy production is used to combine thermal
   and electrical energy. To perform the analysis, a detailed model of a
   BIPV/T system was developed and validated against experimental data.
   Then, the following systems were modeled in TRNSYS: a BIPV/T air system
   and side-by-side PV modules and liquid solar thermal collectors (PV +
   T). A case study was performed by simulating the performance of both
   systems on a 40 m(2) south-facing roof located in Montreal, Canada. The
   total energy produced by both systems was assessed by converting
   electricity into heat with various conversion factors. For a factor of
   2, the BIPV/T system was found to produce 5-29\% more equivalent useful
   thermal energy than the PV + T system for a water temperature at the
   heat exchanger inlet corresponding to 10 degrees C. Under similar
   operating conditions and for systems operating all year long, the
   acceptable cost to recover the heat from the BIPV system in order to
   break even with the cost of the PV + T system was found to be 7000 CAD.

Abstract = {{Emerging systems such as smart grids or intelligent transportation
   systems often require end-user applications to continuously send
   information to external data aggregators performing monitoring or
   control tasks. This can result in an undesirable loss of privacy for the
   users in exchange of the benefits provided by the application. Motivated
   by this trend, this paper introduces privacy concerns in a system
   theoretic context, and addresses the problem of releasing filtered
   signals that respect the privacy of the user data streams. Our approach
   relies on a formal notion of privacy from the database literature,
   called differential privacy, which provides strong privacy guarantees
   against adversaries with arbitrary side information. Methods are
   developed to approximate a given filter by a differentially private
   version, so that the distortion introduced by the privacy mechanism is
   minimized. Two specific scenarios are considered. First, the notion of
   differential privacy is extended to dynamic systems with many
   participants contributing independent input signals. Kalman filtering is
   also discussed in this context, when a released output signal must
   preserve differential privacy for the measured signals or state
   trajectories of the individual participants. Second, differentially
   private mechanisms are described to approximate stable filters when
   participants contribute to a single event stream, extending previous
   work on differential privacy under continual observation.}},

Abstract = {{This technical note presents a continuum approach to a non-Gaussian
   initial mean consensus problem via Mean Field (MF) stochastic control
   theory. In this problem formulation: (i) each agent has simple
   stochastic dynamics with inputs directly controlling its state's rate of
   change and (ii) each agent seeks to minimize by continuous state
   feedback its individual discounted cost function involving the mean of
   the states of all other agents. For this dynamic game problem, a set of
   coupled deterministic (Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and
   Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov) equations is derived approximating the
   stochastic system of agents as the population size goes to infinity. In
   a finite population system(analogous to the MF LQG framework): (i) the
   resulting decentralized MF control strategies possess an epsilon(N)-Nash
   equilibrium property where goes epsilon(N) to zero as the population
   size N approaches infinity and (ii) these MF control strategies steer
   each individual's state toward the initial state population mean which
   is reached asymptotically as time goes to infinity. Hence, the system
   with decentralized MF control strategies reaches mean-consensus on the
   initial state population mean asymptotically as time goes to infinity.}},

Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{Probabilistic graphical models have had a tremendous impact in machine
   learning and approaches based on energy function minimization via
   techniques such as graph cuts are now widely used in image segmentation.
   However, the free parameters in energy function-based segmentation
   techniques are often set by hand or using heuristic techniques. In this
   paper, we explore parameter learning in detail. We show how
   probabilistic graphical models can be used for segmentation problems to
   illustrate Markov random fields (MRFs), their discriminative
   counterparts conditional random fields (CRFs) as well as kernel CRFs. We
   discuss the relationships between energy function formulations, MRFs,
   CRFs, hybrids based on graphical models and their relationships to key
   techniques for inference and learning. We then explore a series of novel
   3D graphical models and present a series of detailed experiments
   comparing and contrasting different approaches for the complete
   volumetric segmentation of multiple organs within computed tomography
   imagery of the abdominal region. Further, we show how these modeling
   techniques can be combined with state of the art image features based on
   histograms of oriented gradients to increase segmentation performance.
   We explore a wide variety of modeling choices, discuss the importance
   and relationships between inference and learning techniques and present
   experiments using different levels of user interaction. We go on to
   explore a novel approach to the challenging and important problem of
   adrenal gland segmentation. We present a 3D CRF formulation and compare
   with a novel 3D sparse kernel CRF approach we call a relevance vector
   random field. The method yields state of the art performance and avoids
   the need to discretize or cluster input features. We believe our work is
   the first to provide quantitative comparisons between traditional MRFs
   with edge-modulated interaction potentials and CRFs for multi-organ
   abdominal segmentation and the first to explore the 3D adrenal gland
   segmentation problem. Finally, along with this paper we provide the
   labeled data used for our experiments to the community.}},

Abstract = {{Several numerical approaches have been proposed in the literature to
   simulate the behavior of modern blast furnaces: finite volume methods,
   data-mining models, heat and mass balance models, and classical
   thermodynamic simulations. Despite this, there is actually no efficient
   method for evaluating quickly optimal operating parameters of a blast
   furnace as a function of the iron ore composition, which takes into
   account all potential chemical reactions that could occur in the system.
   In the current study, we propose a global simulation strategy of a blast
   furnace, the 5-unit process simulation. It is based on classical
   thermodynamic calculations coupled to a direct search algorithm to
   optimize process parameters. These parameters include the minimum
   required metallurgical coke consumption as well as the optimal blast
   chemical composition and the total charge that simultaneously satisfy
   the overall heat and mass balances of the system. Moreover, a Gibbs free
   energy function for metallurgical coke is parameterized in the current
   study and used to fine-tune the simulation of the blast furnace. Optimal
   operating conditions and predicted output stream properties calculated
   by the proposed thermodynamic simulation strategy are compared with
   reference data found in the literature and have proven the validity and
   high precision of this simulation.}},

Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to introduce a pyrolucite fluidized-bed
   reactor (PFBR) as a potential drinking water process to treat
   groundwater containing high levels of dissolved manganese (Mn(II))
   (0.5-3 mg/L) and reduce its concentration to <0.02 mg/L in treated
   water. A pilot-scale study was conducted under dynamic conditions using
   synthetic groundwater (SGW), to elucidate the effect of operational
   conditions and groundwater composition on manganese (Mn) removal
   achieved by the PFBR. Results demonstrated almost complete Mn removal
   (close to 100\%) in less than 1 min under all tested operational
   conditions (influent Mn concentration of 0.5-3 mg/L, calcium (Ca2+)
   hardness of 0-200 mg CaCO3/L, pH of 6.2-7.8, temperature of 9 8z 23 C
   and high hydraulic loading rate (HLR) of 24 63 m/h (i.e., bed expansion
   of 0-30\%)). Improved Mn removal profile was achieved at higher water
   temperature. Also, the results showed that adsorption of Mn(II) onto
   pyrolucite and subsequent slower surface oxidation of sorbed Mn(II) was
   the only mechanism responsible for Mn removal while direct oxidation of
   Mn(II) by free chlorine did not occur even at high concentrations of
   Mn(II) and free chlorine and elevated temperatures. Higher average mass
   transfer coefficient and consequently adsorption rate was achieved at
   elevated HLR. Increasing effluent free chlorine residuals from 1.0 to
   2.0-2.6 mg Cl-2/L allowed increasing the operation time needed for media
   regeneration from 6 days to >12 days. Turbidity was maintained around
   0.2 NTU during the entire test periods indicating good capture of MnO
   colloids within the PFBR. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Topic models are generative probabilistic models which have been applied
   to information retrieval to automatically organize and provide structure
   to a text corpus. Topic models discover topics in the corpus, which
   represent real world concepts by frequently co-occurring words.
   Recently, researchers found topics to be effective tools for structuring
   various software artifacts, such as source code, requirements documents,
   and bug reports. This research also hypothesized that using topics to
   describe the evolution of software repositories could be useful for
   maintenance and understanding tasks. However, research has yet to
   determine whether these automatically discovered topic evolutions
   describe the evolution of source code in a way that is relevant or
   meaningful to project stakeholders, and thus it is not clear whether
   topic models are a suitable tool for this task.
   In this paper, we take a first step towards evaluating topic models in
   the analysis of software evolution by performing a detailed manual
   analysis on the source code histories of two well-known and
   well-documented systems, JHotDraw and jEdit. We define and compute
   various metrics on the discovered topic evolutions and manually
   investigate how and why the metrics evolve over time. We find that the
   large majority (87\%-89\%) of topic evolutions correspond well with
   actual code change activities by developers. We are thus encouraged to
   use topic models as tools for studying the evolution of a software
   system. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{WASTE AND BIOMASS VALORIZATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The scarcity of economically-viable crude oil has prompted chemical
   corporations to look for alternative sources of carbon and hydrogen to
   produce chemicals, biologics and other products. Biomass and waste
   matter are considered one of the foremost raw materials to develop all
   of these industries. Canada produces a tremendous amount of waste: 25
   million tons (an average of 0.8 ton per capita), of which only 25 \% is
   diverted (Statistics Canada 2008). The remaining 17 million tons per
   year is either incinerated or landfilled. This volume of waste is seen
   as an interesting biomass deposit and constitutes an opportunity to
   source alternative fuels and chemicals. The development and operation of
   centralized large scale pyrolysis plants to process domestic waste face
   several problems, which originate mainly from the wide-ranging
   composition of the feedstock. Also, these installations require a
   minimum volume of waste to be operational and cost effective, which
   leads to the costly collection and transportation of waste over long
   distances. Finally, process scale-up is extremely complex as the
   operation of large-scale pyrolysis units is subject to serious
   operational issues. To address these problems, a distributed pyrolysis
   strategy is proposed, which involves the deployment of small scale
   reactors at the waste production site for on-site processing. This
   approach reduces significantly the cost of waste transportation and
   collection and offers alternative ways of valorizing the biogas,
   bio-oil, and char. This presentation will discuss the cost benefits of a
   distributed strategy, the implementation strategy as well as the
   pyrolysis of common elements found in a garbage bag.}},

Title = {{Characterizing the effect of residual stresses on high cycle fatigue
   (HCF) with induction heating treated stainless steel specimens}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{59}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A new method for introducing a predetermined amount of residual stresses
   in stainless steel thick-walled hollow fatigue test specimens was
   developed by the authors {[}1] using high frequency induction heating.
   The advantage of the proposed method over more traditional approaches is
   to avoid any change in other important fatigue parameters, i.e. surface
   roughness, geometry, and microstructure, while introducing the residual
   stresses. The last point only holds if the material under study does not
   undergo any phase transformation within the range of temperatures and
   time exposures reached during the heat treatment. In this paper, the
   effect of residual stresses on high cycle fatigue (HCF) life of annealed
   AISI 304L stainless steel is investigated by introducing a residual
   stress field in thick-walled hollow fatigue specimens and by comparing
   the fatigue life obtained with the reference S-N curve. For the
   particular case studied, a surprising observation is made. Introducing
   tensile residual stresses beneath the surface of hollow fatigue
   specimens using the method proposed by Paquet et al. {[}1] leads to
   improved HCF lives. Validity of this result is confirmed by a
   statistical analysis. Residual stresses were analyzed by the X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) technique to rationalize this experimental result. The
   increase in fatigue life is explained by residual stresses evolution
   within the specimen cross section during the fatigue test, leading to a
   build up of compressive residual stresses beneath its surface. This is a
   clear demonstration that assimilating residual stresses resulting from
   fabrication processes to superimposed static mean stresses can lead to
   considerable errors in fatigue life predictions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this work, a hybrid finite element formulation is presented to
   predict the flutter boundaries of circular cylindrical shells made of
   functionally graded (FG) materials. The development is based on a
   combination of linear Sanders thin shell theory and the classic finite
   element method. Material properties are temperature dependent and graded
   in the shell thickness direction according to a simple power law
   distribution in terms of volume fractions of constituents. The
   temperature field is assumed to be uniform over the shell surface and
   along the shell thickness. First-order piston theory is applied to
   account for supersonic aerodynamic pressure. The effects of temperature
   rise and shell internal pressure on the flutter boundaries of a FG
   circular cylindrical shell for different values of power law index are
   investigated. The present study shows efficient and reliable results

Abstract = {{This paper studies one- and two-step homogenization models for
   predicting the stiffness of Polymer-Clay Nanocomposites (PCN) with
   aligned particles. In particular, the influence of the Effective
   Particle (EP) concept central to two-step models is assessed for
   numerical as well as analytical modeling. This study covers intercalated
   PCN, as well as exfoliated morphologies in the presence of interphase.
   The predictions of analytical and simplified numerical homogenization
   models were compared against detailed 3D Finite Element (FE) simulations
   where the PCN layered microstructure is explicitly simulated. The
   Representative Volume Element (RVE) was rigorously determined. The
   theoretical predictions were also compared against experimental data
   extracted from the literature. It was found that both numerical and
   analytical two-step methods may significantly diverge from the FE
   simulations of the detailed microstructures. In general, the analytical
   multi-coated inclusions model delivers more reliable results than
   two-step methods. Despite their higher computational costs, one-step FE
   models are necessary, depending on the PCN microstructure and the
   desired accuracy. It was also found that the more the EP is different
   from the nanoclay, in terms of rigidity and aspect ratio, or the higher
   the volume fraction is, the more the accuracy of two-step numerical
   models is deteriorated. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   to perform the homogenization of the nonlinearly piezoelectric
   composites followed by iteration in order to minimize errors (residual)
   from the linearization. For all boundary conditions, including nonlinear
   response, simulated in this work, the predictions given by the
   Mori-Tanaka and UC models were reasonably close to the ones of the RVE
   cases. Finally the RVEs were modified to examine the linear and
   nonlinear electro-mechanical responses of piezoelectric ceramics with
   pores. Depending on the prescribed boundary conditions, the existence of
   pores could significantly alter the electro-mechanical response of
   piezoelectric ceramics. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, mullite-bonded porous SiC ceramics were fabricated
   using reaction bonding techniques. The morphologies, phase composition,
   open porosity, pore size distribution and mechanical strength of porous
   ceramics were examined as a function of alumina sources (calcined
   nanosized alumina powder and alumina sol prepared from hydrolysis of
   aluminum isopropwdde) and contents. It was found that the addition of
   alumina in powder form effectively enhanced the strength and decreased
   the porosity. In contrast, when alumina was added in sol form, a reverse
   effect was observed. Moreover, it was revealed that when a portion of
   calcined alumina was replaced by alumina sol, the mechanical properties
   improved significantly (more than 30\%) as well as porosity compared to
   the traditional method. Pore size distribution analysis showed that the
   dispersion of nanosize alumina powder and SiC micro-particles in alumina
   sol is strongly improved compared to mixing in ethanol. (C) 2013

Title = {{Thermal transport through short-period SiGe nanodot superlattices}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{The cross-plane thermal conductivity kappa of multilayers of SiGe
   nanodots separated either by Si or SiGe can be decreased by reducing the
   period length or by increasing the nanodot density. It is, however, not
   clear how far kappa can be reduced by using these strategies. In
   addition, the role of SiGe nanodots on the reduction of kappa is still
   not fully understood. In this work, we addressed these issues by
   studying experimentally the cross-plane kappa of Ge/Si superlattices
   with period lengths down to 1.5 nm. Although kappa tends to preserve the
   decreasing trend with reducing the period length, for periods shorter
   than 2 nm we observed a drastic drop of the average thermal resistance
   per period. This finding indicates a weakening of the effect of the
   interfaces on phonon scattering and implies a lower limit for kappa. To
   assess the role played by the nanodots in the reduction of kappa we
   studied Ge/Si superlattices with nanodot densities varying from 0 to
   similar to 8 x 10(10) cm(-2) and a fixed Si spacer thickness of 2.7 nm.
   The experimental results suggest that SiGe nanodots with
   ``pyramid{''}-shape have an effect comparable to nominally planar
   wetting layers on the cross-plane thermal transport. Finally, the
   comparison of superlattices with nanodots separated by Si1-xGex (with x
   from 0 to 0.2) shows that spacer alloying is beneficial in reducing the
   kappa by similar to 20\%. The results presented in this work are
   expected to be relevant to micro/nanoscale energy conversion which
   requires minimizing the thermal conductivity of superlattice-based thin
   film thermoelectrics. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Children can be exposed to toxic elements in toys and jewelry following
   ingestion. As, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Sb bioavailability was assessed (n =
   24) via the in vitro gastrointestinal protocol (IVG), the
   physiologically based extraction test (PBET), and the European Toy
   Safety Standard protocol (EN 71-3), and health risks were characterized.
   Cd, Cu, Ni, and Pb were mobilized from 19 metallic toys and jewelry (MJ)
   and one crayon set. Bioaccessible Cd, Ni, or Pb exceeded EU migratable
   concentration limits in four to six MJ, depending on the protocol. Using
   two-phase (gastric + intestinal) IVG or PBET might be preferable over EN
   71-3 since they better represent gastrointestinal physiology.
   Bioaccessible and total metal concentrations were different and not
   always correlated, indicating that bioaccessibility measurement may
   provide more accurate risk characterization. More information on impacts
   of multiple factors affecting metals mobilization from toys and jewelry
   is needed before recommending specific tests. Hazard index (HI) for Cd,
   Ni, or Pb were >1 for all six MJ exceeding the EU limits. For infants
   (6-12 mo old), 10 MJ had HI > 1 for Cd, Cu, Ni, or Pb (up to 75 for Cd
   and 43 for Pb). Research on prolonged exposure to MJ and comprehensive
   risk characterization for toys and jewelry exposure is recommended.}},

Volume = {{60}},

Abstract = {{This paper offers a thorough assessment on the performance of the
   extrapolation method for the lattice Boltzmann simulation of viscous
   mixing flows. This method appears to be well-suited for the treatment of
   the complex boundary conditions found in various mixing systems. Here,
   the ability to simulate accurate power consumption and pumping capacity
   is evaluated on several configurations of the Maxblend mixing system,
   which has proven efficient in a wide range of applications. First, the
   impact of the boundary conditions on the spatial convergence of the
   lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is determined on the 3D Couette flow,
   clearly showing that small modifications of the boundary conditions may
   reduce the accuracy of the predicted shear rate and power. Second, a
   parallel LBM scheme was used to simulate fluid flow within a Maxblend
   mixing system. For the unbaffled configuration, the simulated power
   consumption and the pumping capacity are observed to be in good
   agreement with experimental data and finite element simulation results.
   The effect of the bottom clearance is also successfully evaluated,
   suggesting that the standard bottom clearance is not optimum in the
   transitional regime. Lastly, results for the most geometrically complex
   case (baffled configuration) indicate that the power consumption is
   affected by numerical perturbations appearing around the moving
   impeller. Overall, these results show that, when combined with the
   extrapolation method for the treatment of boundary conditions, the LBM
   is an efficient tool for the investigation of viscous flow in mixers of
   industrial relevance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Given a class of graphs F, a forbidden subgraph characterization (FSC)
   is a set of graphs H such that a graph G belongs F if and only if no
   graph of H is isomorphic to an induced subgraph of G. FSCs play a key
   role in graph theory, and are at the center of many important results
   obtained in that field. In this paper, we present novel methods that
   automate the generation of conjectures on FSCs. Since most classes of
   graphs do not have such characterization, we also describe methods to
   find less restrictive results in the form of necessary or sufficient
   conditions to characterize a class of graphs with forbidden subgraphs.
   Furthermore, while these methods require to explore a possibly infinite
   search space, we present an enumerative technique that guarantees the
   discovery of characterizations involving forbidden subgraphs with a
   limited number of vertices. Another technique, which enables the
   discovery of characterizations with much larger subgraphs through the
   use of a heuristic search, is also described. In our experiments, we use
   these methods to find new theorems on the characterization of well-known
   graph classes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The expression of recombinant yeast pyruvate carboxylase (PYC) in animal
   cell lines was shown in previous studies to reduce significantly the
   formation of waste metabolites, although it has translated into mixed
   results in terms of improved cellular growth and productivity. In this
   work, we demonstrate that the unique phenotype of PYC expressing cells
   can be exploited through the application of a dynamic fed-batch strategy
   and lead to significant process enhancements. Metabolically engineered
   HEK293 cells stably producing human recombinant IFN alpha 2b and
   expressing the PYC enzyme were cultured in batch and fed-batch modes.
   Compared to parental cells, the maximum cell density in batch was
   increased 1.5-fold and the culture duration was extended by 2.5 days,
   but the product yield was only marginally increased. Further
   improvements were achieved by developing and implementing a dynamic
   fed-batch strategy using a concentrated feed solution. The feeding was
   based on an automatic control-loop to maintain a constant glucose
   concentration. This strategy led to a further 2-fold increase in maximum
   cell density (up to 10.7 x 10(6) cells/ml) and a final product titer of
   160 mg/l, representing nearly a 3-fold yield increase compared to the
   batch process with the parental cell clone. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, a micromilling type-2 fuzzy tool condition monitoring
   system based on multiple AE acoustic emission signal features is

   the ambiguities and uncertainties associated with the signal itself.
   Using the results of root-mean-square error estimation and the
   variations in the results of type-2 fuzzy modeling of all signal
   features, the most reliable ones are selected and integrated into
   cutting tool life estimation models. The obtained results show that the
   type-2 fuzzy tool life estimation is in accordance with the cutting tool
   wear state during the micromilling process. The information about
   uncertainty prediction of tool life is of great importance for tool

Abstract = {{The growing popularity of Poly lactic acid (PLA) is related to its
   biocompatibility, good mechanical properties, and its synthesis from
   renewable resources. PLA can be compounded with electrically conductive
   fillers (e.g., carbon nanotubes (CNTs)) to form carbon polymer
   composites (CPC). These fillers provide the conductive functionality by
   forming percolative paths. Featuring very low weight densities, CPCs
   have the potential to replace metals in the electronic industry if they
   exhibit similar electrical conductivities. The current challenges being
   faced during the mixing of CNTs in a polymer matrix are the formation of
   aggregates due to the strong van der Waals forces and the breakage of
   the CNTs during dispersion. In this study, we compare: (1) two
   fabrication methods to create CPCs (i.e., solution mixing by sonication
   and extrusion) and (2) effects of various CNT functionalization
   techniques (i.e., acid and plasma treatments) on the conductivity of the
   CPCs. First, the composites comprising of 30\% PLA by weight in
   Dichloromethane (DCM) and CNTs in different concentrations (up to
   5wt.\%) are fabricated by two step sonication method (i.e., dissolving
   PLA in DCM and then dispersing the CNTs in the polymer solution).
   Second, CPCs are fabricated using a micro twin screw extruder operating
   at 180 degrees C. To verify the effects of functionalization of the CNTs
   on the conductivity of composites, the CNTs are functionalized via three
   methods: -HNO3 acid functionalization, 3:1 ratio HNO3 + H2SO4 acid
   (stronger) functionalization and N-2 plasma functionalization. CPC
   fibers are drawn using the solvent-cast printing method. These fibers
   are then tested for their electrical conductivity using the two probe
   method. The maximum electrical conductivity is showed by the 5\% CNT
   concentration samples at 3.97 Sim and 25.16 S/m for the CPC fibers
   obtained via the solution blend and the extrusion methods, respectively.
   Regarding the functionalized CNTs, conductivity measurements show a
   negative effect of the CNTs functionalization on the electrical
   properties of the CPC.}},

Abstract = {{The initial tool wear during machining of titanium metal matrix
   composite (TiMMCs) is the result of several wear mechanisms: tool layer
   damage, friction - tribological wear, adhesion, diffusion and brace
   wear. This phenomenon occurs at the first instant and extends to only
   ten seconds at most. In this case the adhesive wear is the most
   important mechanism while the brace wear is considered as a resistance
   wear layer at the beginning of the steady wear period. In this paper,
   the effect of the initial tool wear and initial cutting conditions on
   tool wear progression and tool life is investigated. We proposed herein
   a new mathematical model based on the scatter wear and Lyapunov exponent
   to study quantitatively the ``chaotic tool wear{''}. The Chaos theory,
   which has proved efficient in explaining how something changes in time,
   was used to demonstrate the dependence of the tool life on the initial
   cutting conditions and thus contribute to a better understanding of the
   influence of the initial cutting condition on the tool life. Based on
   the chaotic tool wear model, the scatter wear dimension and Lyapunov
   exponents were found to be positive in all case of the initial cutting
   conditions such as initial speed, feed rate and depth of cut. The
   initial cutting speed appears however to have the most significant
   impact on tool life. In particular, the mathematical model was
   successfully applied to the case of machining TiMMCs. It was clearly
   shown that changing the initial cutting speed by 20 m/min for the first
   two seconds of machining instead of keeping it constant at 60 m/min
   during the whole cutting process leads to an increase in the tool life
   (up to 24\%).}},

   accuracy and low execution time. Accordingly, we observe two research
   directions: the first focuses on improving the algorithms and the second
   focuses on designing fast hardware platforms. In this paper, we propose
   an efficient parallel implementation of an accurate extended Canny edge
   detection algorithm suitable for medical applications on embedded
   many-core platform. The proposed implementation is running at a frame
   rate of 10 frames/s for image size of 512x512 with high accurate and
   smooth line edges.}},

Abstract = {{To increase reliability and remote operation capability, automated
   control based on SCADA systems were introduced in the electrical grid.
   This exposed the grid to cyber attacks which, due to the cyber-physical
   nature of the combined system, can cause physical damage such as power
   outages. This dual nature makes it hard for grid operators to evaluate
   the physical impacts of cyber attacks. To do so, we introduce a
   modification of the ICS sandbox architecture to perform impact
   assessment of cyber attacks. This is done by interfacing the emulated
   SCADA network with the PyPower electrical simulator which provides
   global information about the state of the electrical grid. Finally, to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the system, a cyber attack based on an
   optimal disruption experiment is run and its effects in terms of
   operation cost are graphed in real time.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: In health monitoring and biotelemetry, the real-time
   recording of ground reaction forces under each foot during gait has a
   large potential for the automatic detection of abnormal posture, falling
   prevention, etc. at home or in public places. For this, mounting a large
   force platform on/in the ground ensures to record data for numerous
   footsteps while avoiding the step `targeting' problem. Davis and
   Cavanagh (1993) have proposed a solution using a large force plate but
   several points of Davis and Cavanagh's method remain unclear and hardly
   computable. Objective: Develop a method that decomposes left and right
   GRF profiles from the GRF profile recorded on a single platform. This
   method aims to include a systematic detection of the single to double
   stand-phase-instants in order to lead to accurate measurement of the
   total GRF component in typically developing children. Methods: Six
   children were asked to walk without targeting their footsteps on a
   set-up composed of independent force platforms. The total GRF component,
   independently measured on the different platforms, was numerically
   summed to obtain the corresponding global total GRF, to which the
   decomposition method was applied. Then, the validation consisted in
   comparing the total GRF computed from this decomposition to the
   independently measured total GRF. Results: The mean relative error
   between the computed total GRF and the corresponding measured vertical
   GRF of 36 double stances (6 double stances x 6 children) is equal to 3.8
   +/- 2.6\%. Conclusion: We have implemented an innovative method to
   assess with accuracy the vertical GRF component under each foot using a
   unique large force platform. This leads to large perspectives in health
   monitoring and biotelemetry.}},

Abstract = {{Vortex beams, which are electromagnetic beams carrying orbital angular
   momentum, have a great potential for communication, sensing, imaging and
   tweezing applications. Unfortunately, the spatial light modulator
   technology that is used in the optical regime to generate vortex beams
   is not applicable at radio frequencies and the recently introduced
   metasurface technology suffers from integration difficulty. To solve
   these issues, we introduce here the concept of generating vortex beams
   using a circular leaky-wave antenna (CLWA). In this approach, the
   spiral-shaped phase fronts of the vortex wave are produced by the
   interference of circularly twisted phase fronts due to off-broadside
   radiation in the unfolded antenna, while the beam is obtained from the
   restricted circular aperture of the CLWA. The paper explains the
   principle in details and provides an experimental demonstration for the
   case of unit topological charges. The antenna may support simultaneously
   different orbital angular momenta so as to provide an unprecedented
   multiplexing technology.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a structure of dual diode microstrip rectifier circuit
   operating at 35 GHz capable of harmonic harvesting is proposed to
   improve the RF-to-DC conversion efficiency, To do so, the conventional
   voltage doubler is first modified for 35 GHz operation. Then, a harmonic
   harvesting rectifier is designed and optimized in order to maximize the
   RF-to-DC conversion efficiency. Both circuits are fabricated and
   experimentally tested. Measured efficiency of 34\% for 20 mW RF input
   power for harmonic harvester model and 23\% for the same RF power level
   for the modified voltage doubler are obtained. Results of the harmonic
   harvester rectifier suggest about 20\% efficiency improvement for medium
   power range (1 to 100 mW) at millimeter-wave frequency compared to
   previously reported designs. The proposed structure can find potential
   applications in the design of millimeter-wave wireless power
   transmission and energy harvesting devices.}},

Abstract = {{Air-filled Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) based on multilayer
   Printed Circuit Board (PCB) process is proposed in this paper for
   millimeter-wave applications that require low cost, high performances
   and compactness. This air-filled SIW allows for substantial loss
   reduction and power handling enhancement. Its fabrication involves three
   layers. The top and bottom substrates can consist of a low cost standard
   substrate such as FR-4 on which base-band or digital circuits can be
   implemented so to obtain a very compact, high performance and low cost
   millimeter-wave system. At Ka-band, it is shown that air-filled SIW
   compared to dielectric-filled SIW based on Rogers RT/Duroid 5880 and
   6002 reduces losses by a mean value of 0.054 dB/cm and 0.11 dB/cm and
   increases average power handling capability by 6 dB and 8 dB,
   respectively. To allow interconnects of the proposed air-filled SIW with
   dielectric-filled SIW, a broadband transition is presented. The design
   steps of this transition are detailed. For demonstration purposes, a
   back-to-back transition operating over the Ka-band is fabricated. It
   achieves a matching of better than -15 dB and an insertion loss of 0.6
   +/- 0.2 dB (0.3 +/- 0.1dB for the transition) from 27 to 40 GHz.}},

Abstract = {{Two new interconnects between coplanar waveguide (CPW) and substrate
   integrated waveguide (SIW) are introduced and studied. Contrary to
   previously published interconnects, the new ones are shorter and require
   less space on the printed-circuit board. Thus they are ideally suited
   for dense packaging and integration. The first one is a regular
   interconnect that runs the slots of the CPW directly into the SIW. It is
   straightforwardly designed and achieves 26 dB return loss over a 10 GHz
   bandwidth centered at 23 GHz. The second interconnect is of the inverted
   type. It is 43 percent shorter than the first one over the same
   frequency range and at the same return loss level. Experimental results
   conducted at back-to-back transitions agree well with theoretical
   predictions. The shortest inverted interconnect achieves a measured
   back-to-back return loss of better than 18.5 dB over the entire
   frequency range with a maximum insertion loss of 1.28 dB. The
   comparative values of the regular back-to-back CPW-to-SIW prototype are

Abstract = {{A few analytical models for a simply-supported cylinder subjected to a
   concentric annular flow have been developed considering small
   perturbations in the flow components. The flow perturbation is believed
   to play a key role in causing instabilities or reducing the effective
   tube damping. However, it is generally accepted that there is no dynamic
   instability of a simply-supported cylinder subjected to concentric
   annular flows; the dynamic instability may materialize only with a very
   flexible rod where traveling wave solutions are expected. The dynamic
   behavior of a concentric annular flow in a finite-length-narrow gap at
   the mid-span of a cylinder is studied to investigate the possibility of
   a dynamic instability in the case of a simply-supported cylinder. In
   this study, typically used stainless steel tubing and geometry in
   engineering application are applied with some fluid boundary conditions
   at the finite-length-narrow gap such as a contraction entrance and a
   diffuser exit. The research results from this study are as follows: (1)
   determination of an analytical solution for tube dynamics in terms of
   fluid boundary conditions such as contraction loss at the entrance and
   pressure recovery at the exit of the finite-length-annular gap, (2)

Abstract = {{Gas-liquid pipe flow is common in nuclear, gas \& oil, refrigeration and
   power generation industries, where gas-liquid mixtures are transported
   in piping systems. The mixtures flows in different flow patterns, such
   as bubbly, slug and annular, generating dynamic fluid forces which may
   induce structural vibration. In many industrial cases, Flow-Induced
   Vibrations (FIV) are an intrinsic part of the piping operation and does
   not present risks that may lead to structural component failures. In
   this sense, the information available on this topic is quite scanty. In
   this paper, we present an in-depth discussion about the phenomenology of
   the FIV due to two-phase pipe flow. A set of 32 two-phase horizontal
   flow conditions was collected, including bubbly, slug and dispersed
   flow-patterns. The homogeneous mixture velocity J was in the range of
   0.5 to 25 m/s, with homogeneous void fractions of beta = 10\%, 25\%,
   50\%, 75\% and 95\%. Signals of acceleration were acquired to correlate
   pipe vibration and two-phase flow parameters. Results show higher
   acceleration levels in slug and dispersed than in bubbly flow. We find
   that the acceleration frequency response contains useful information of
   the flow. Comparisons with single-phase flow are also presented.
   Finally, an exploratory experimental technique to predict two-phase flow
   pattern from vibration response based on the combination resonance
   caused by both single and two-phase flow is proposed. The results
   indicate that the proposed-technique is acceptable to recognize
   intermittent flow patterns in two-phase flow.}},

Abstract = {{The time delay is a key parameter for modeling fluidelastic instability,
   especially the damping controlled mechanism. It can be determined
   experimentally by measuring directly the time lag between the tube
   motion and the induced fluid forces. The fluid forces may be obtained by
   integrating the pressure field around the moving tube. However, this
   method faces certain difficulties in two-phase flow since the high
   turbulence and the non-uniformity of the flow may increase the
   randomness of the measured force. To overcome this difficulty, an
   innovative method for extracting the time delay inherent to the
   quasi-steady model for fluidelastic instability is proposed in this
   study.
   Firstly, experimental measurements of unsteady and quasistatic fluid
   forces (in the lift direction) acting on a tube subject to two-phase
   flow were conducted. The unsteady fluid forces were measured by exciting
   the tube using a linear motor. These forces were measured for a wide
   range of void fraction, flow velocities and excitation frequencies. The
   experimental results showed that the unsteady fluid forces could be
   represented as single valued function of the reduced velocity (flow
   velocity reduced by the excitation frequency and the tube diameter).
   The time delay was determined by equating the unsteady fluid forces with
   the quasi-static forces. The results given by this innovative method of
   measuring the time delay in two-phase flow were consistent with
   theoretical expectations. The time delay could be expressed as a linear
   function of the convection time and the time delay parameter was
   determined for void fractions ranging from 60\% to 90\%.
   Fluidelastic instability calculations were also performed using the
   quasi-steady model with the newly measured time delay parameter.
   Previously conducted stability tests provided the experimental data
   necessary to validate the theoretical results of the quasi-steady model.
   The validity of the quasi-steady model for two-phase flow was confirmed
   by the good agreement between its results and the experimental data. The
   newly measured time delay parameter has improved significantly the
   theoretical results, especially for high void fractions (90\%). However,
   the model could not be verified for void fractions lower or equal to
   50\% due to the limitation of the current experimental setup. Further
   studies are consequently required to clarify this point. Nevertheless,
   this model can be used to simulate the flow induced vibrations in steam
   generators' tube bundles as their most critical parts operate at high
   void fractions (>= 60\%).}},

Abstract = {{Global collaboration is now a key for enterprises to rapidly achieve
   their worldwide successes. During the rapid expansion of their business,
   many challenges are emerging, e.g., novice training, knowledge
   transferring, intellectual property (IF) protection. This paper
   presented an effective approach for gaining new knowledge in a design
   project through reverse engineering by using Environment Based Design
   (EBD) methodology. The case study used in this paper was designed to
   demonstrate how design knowledge can be assimilated by using the
   proposed approach. A graduate student, without any aerospace design
   knowledge and experience, was presented with a sentence extracted from a
   statement of work of a student capstone project in the aerospace
   engineering department of Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal. Within a
   month, the graduate student designer was able to deliver a conceptual
   design solution including product life cycle analysis, with only public
   resources at his disposal. The results were then evaluated by experts in
   aerospace who have collectively overseen the project for many years, on
   how much knowledge the student had assimilated. A comparison, between
   the student designer and other novice designers from the project, was
   given thereafter. The assessment turns out promising and inspiring in
   terms of the knowledge assimilation for a novice within such a short
   tune. In other words, the effectiveness of the presented approach has
   been validated. This is a feasible attempt to significantly shorten the
   time and minimize the efforts for novice training and knowledge
   transferring in education and industry, especially when a firm is
   expanding their global business.}},

Abstract = {{In legged mobile robotics the most common approach is to design fully
   actuated legs with several degrees of freedom (DOF) in order to
   successfully navigate through rough terrains. However, simpler leg
   architectures with as few as one-DOF have been developed in the past to
   achieve the very same goal. The ability of these simpler legs to
   traverse uneven terrains is arguably limited with respect to multi-DOF
   designs, but in some applications the reduction of the DOF and hence, of
   the number of actuators, as well as the simplicity of the associated
   control could be a great advantage and the decisive argument. In this
   paper, the authors propose a novel one-DOF robotic leg that has been
   specially designed to achieve the greatest robustness possible with
   respect to the difficult terrains it has to traverse. In order to do
   that, a method to analyze and optimize any one-DOF robotic leg with
   respect to its ability to overcome obstacles is proposed here. This
   method is based on a simple and efficient novel technique to generate
   synthetic terrains combined with a simulation algorithm estimating the
   traversability of the particular one-DOF leg design under scrutiny. To
   illustrate the generality of the proposed method, it is used to design
   both an optimal leg with the architecture presented here for the first
   time and also, one with the most common one-DOF leg architecture found
   in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results obtained from a research work
   investigating the performance of different Adaptive models developed to
   predict excitation forces on a dynamically loaded flexible structure.
   For this purpose, a flexible structure is equipped with acceleration
   transducers at each degree of freedom and a force transducer for
   validation and training. The models are trained using data obtained from
   applying a random excitation force on the flexible structure. The
   performance of the developed models is evaluated by analyzing the
   prediction capabilities based on a normalized prediction error. The
   frequency domain is considered to analyze the similarity of the
   frequencies in the predicted and the original force signal. For a
   selection of the best models, a more advanced performance analysis is
   carried out. This includes application of the trained models to
   deterministic and non-deterministic excitation forces with different
   excitation frequencies and amplitudes. Additionally, the influence of
   the sampling frequency and sensor location on the model performance is
   investigated. The results obtained in this paper show that most data
   mining approaches can be used, when a certain degree of inaccuracy is
   accepted. Furthermore, the comparison study points out that the
   transducer location is crucial for the model performance. However, there
   exists no general solution for the final selection of models.}},

Abstract = {{Mechatronic systems are a combination of cooperative mechanical,
   electronics and control components. The high number of their components,
   their multi-physical aspect, the couplings between the different domains
   involved and the interacting design objectives makes the design task
   very tedious ad complex. Due to this inherent complexity, a concurrent
   systematic and multi-objective design thinking methodology is crucial to
   replace the often used sequential design approach that tends to deal
   with the different domains separately. In this research we present a new
   multi-criteria profile for mechatronic system performance evaluation in
   conceptual design stage. The newly introduced Mechatronic Multi-criteria
   Profile (MA/IP) includes various quantitative members such as
   intelligence, reliability, complexity, flexibility and cost. A nonlinear
   fuzzy integral called 2-additive Choquet Integral will be used for the
   aggregation of criteria and fitting the intuitive requirements for
   decision-making in the presence of interacting criteria. Finally, the
   effectiveness of the proposed method will be validated via a case study
   of designing a robotic visual servoing system.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a new definition of privacy based on query frequencies, as
   well as a frequency-based constraint relaxation methodology for private
   queries. Private queries undergo processing so that users may obtain
   data from a database in such a way that the user's search intentions,
   i.e. the data which the user is interested in, will be protected against
   exposure. Most existing protocols for private querying rely on the
   following two constraints to achieve privacy: i) queries are encoded so
   that the database server can handle query processes but cannot actually
   decode queries; ii) the server is forced to check all data in the server
   when computing query results. Because of these constraints, even
   database servers cannot distinguish which data are selected from the
   database. However, this second constraint compels servers to spend
   Omicron(n) computational cost for each query processed, where n is the
   number of data entries on the server. We introduce a weaker privacy
   condition which ensures that search intentions are hidden within a
   portion of the database, as opposed to ordinary private queries which
   hide search intentions among all data in the database, and we argue that
   this definition of privacy is sufficient to combat attacks based on
   query frequencies. Our relaxation methodology relaxes the second
   constraint above and allows private querying while only examining a
   portion of the data in most cases. Our methodology is also flexible and
   applies not only to exact match queries in one dimensional data but also
   to range queries in one dimensional data and exact match queries in two
   dimensional data.}},

   MUSIC-type algorithm which estimates the DOA using samples collected
   from different configurations (scanning steps) of the antenna radiation

Abstract = {{Building Information Modeling has become a widely accepted tool used to
   overcome the many hurdles that currently face the Architecture,
   Engineering and Construction industries. However, implementing such a
   system is always complex, and the recent introduction of BIM does not
   allow organizations to build their experience on acknowledged standards
   and procedures. Moreover, data on implementation projects is still
   disseminated and fragmentary. The objective of this study is to develop
   an assistance model for BIM implementation. Solutions to evolve towards
   a better integrated and better used BIM are proposed, taking into
   account the different maturity levels of each organization. Indeed,
   based on the widely recognized Critical Success Factors, concrete
   activities helping implementation are identified and can be undertaken
   according to a previous maturity evaluation of an organization. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Popular CAPTCHA systems consist of garbled printed text character images
   with significant distortions and noise. It is believed that humans have
   little difficulty in deciphering the text, whereas automated systems are
   foiled by the added noise and distortion. However, in recent years,
   several text based CAPTCHAs have been reported as broken, that is,
   automated systems can identify the text in the displayed image with a
   reasonable amount of success. An extension to the text based CAPTCHA
   concept is to utilize unconstrained handwritten text, which is still
   considered to be a challenging problem for automated systems. In this
   work, we present a automated handwritten CAPTCHA generation system by
   adding distortions to the Sigma-Lognormal representation of a
   handwritten word sample. In addition, several noise models are also
   considered. We perform experiments on the UNIPEN dataset and demonstrate
   the efficacy of the approach.}},

Abstract = {{Still-to-video face recognition (FR) is an important function in
   watchlist screening, where faces captured over a network of video
   surveillance cameras are matched against reference stills of target
   individuals. Recognizing faces in a watchlist is a challenging problem
   in semi-and unconstrained surveillance environments due to the lack of
   control over capture and operational conditions, and to the limited
   number of reference stills. This paper provides a performance baseline
   and guidelines for ensemble-based systems using a single high-quality
   reference still per individual, as found in many watchlist screening
   applications. In particular, modular systems are considered, where an
   ensemble of template matchers based on multiple face representations is
   assigned to each individual of interest. During enrollment, multiple
   feature extraction (FE) techniques are applied to patches isolated in
   the reference still to generate diverse face-part representations that
   are robust to various nuisance factors (e.g., illumination and pose)
   encountered in video surveillance. The selection of relevant feature
   subsets, decision thresholds, and fusion functions of ensembles are
   achieved using faces of non-target individuals selected from reference
   videos (forming a universal background model). During operations, a face
   tracker gradually regroups faces captured from different people
   appearing in a scene, while each user-specific ensemble generates a
   decision per face capture. This leads to robust spatio-temporal FR when
   accumulated ensemble predictions surpass a detection threshold.
   Simulation results obtained with the Chokepoint video dataset show a
   significant improvement to accuracy, (1) when performing score-level
   fusion of matchers, where patches-based and FE techniques generate
   ensemble diversity; (2) when defining feature subsets and decision
   thresholds for each individual matcher of an ensemble using non-target
   videos; and (3) when accumulating positive detections over multiple
   frames.}},

Abstract = {{We present an algorithm intended to visually represent the sense of verb
   related to an object described in a text sequence, as a movement in 3D
   space. We describe a specific semantic analyzer, based on a standard
   verbal ontology, dedicated to the interpretation of action verbs as
   spatial actions. Using this analyzer, our system build a generic 3D
   graphical path for verbal concepts allowing space representation, listed
   as SelfMotion concepts in the FrameNet ontology project. The object
   movement is build by first extracting the words and enriching them with
   the semantic analyzer. Then, weight tables, necessary to obtain
   characteristics values (orientation, shape, trajectory...) for the verb
   are used in order to get a 3D path, as realist as possible. The weight
   tables were created to make parallel between features defined for
   SelfMotion verbal concept (some provided by FrameNet, other determined
   during the project) and values used in the final algorithm used to
   create 3D moving representations from input text. We evaluate our
   analyzer on a corpus of short sentences and presents our results.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, several investigations on hydraulic turbine draft tube
   performance have shown that the hydrodynamic field at the runner's
   outlet is a direct outcome of the runner design and the operating point.
   This has shown the dependence of the diffuser efficiency on the flow
   rate and the inlet swirling flow intensity, mostly on turbines that
   present low head (high specific velocity) and operate away from their
   best efficiency point. The numerical optimization of the inlet velocity
   profile is presented as an attempt to control these two inlet flow
   characteristics. The goal is the improvement of the flow through the
   draft tube to allow for better turbine performance. This methodology is
   based on the automatic coupling of several commercial softwares and. is
   used to manipulate the analytical representation of the swirling flow,
   which has led to the minimization of hydraulic losses. Also, a
   qualitative and quantitative analysis of the draft tube flow field
   provoked by a redesigned inlet velocity profiles, has helped to
   understand how it is possible to suppress or at least mitigate
   undesirable draft tube flow characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Modern software uses frameworks through their Application Programming
   Interfaces (APIs). Framework APIs may change while frameworks evolve.
   Client programs have to upgrade to new releases of frameworks if
   security vulnerabilities are discovered in the used releases. Patching
   security vulnerabilities can be delayed by non-security-related API
   changes when the frameworks used by client programs are not up to date.
   Keeping frameworks updated can reduce the reaction time to patch
   security leaks. Client program upgrades are not cost-free, developers
   need to understand the API usages in client programs and API changes
   between framework releases before conduct upgrading tasks. In this
   paper, we propose a tool ACUA to generate reports containing detailed
   API change and usage information by analyzing the binary code of both
   frameworks and clients programs written in Java. Developers can use the
   API change and usage reports generated by ACUA to estimate the work load
   and decide when to starting upgrading client programs based on the
   estimation.}},

Abstract = {{Automated verification tools are required to detect coding errors that
   may lead to severe software vulnerabilities. However, the usage of these
   tools is still not well integrated into software development life cycle.
   In this paper, we present our approach that brings the software
   compilation process and security verification to a meeting point where
   both can be applied simultaneously in a user-friendly manner. Our
   security verification engine is implemented as a new GCC pass that can
   be enabled via flag -fsecurity-check=checks. xml where the input XML
   file contains a set of user-defined security checks. The verification
   operates on the GIMPLE intermediate representation of source code that
   is language and platform independent. The conducted experiments
   demonstrate the scalability, efficiency and performance of our engine
   used to verify large scale software, especially the entire Linux kernel
   source code.}},

   system, which is of great importance for fertilizers applications. The
   liquid phase and all solid solutions were modeled using the Modified
   Quasichemical Model for short-range ordering. The liquid model includes
   the reaction of dimerization of AH(2)PO(4) (where A = NH4+ or K+)
   according to : 2 AH(2)PO(4(liquid)) -> A(2)H(2)P(2)O(7(liquid)) +
   H2O(liquid or gas). The model parameters are mainly obtained by the
   critical evaluation and optimization of available thermodynamic and
   phase equilibrium data for the lower-order subsystems. The model is then
   used to estimate the properties of multicomponent salts from these
   assessed parameters for the lower-order subsystems, using interpolation
   methods along with Gibbs energy minimization software. When used in
   conjunction with thermodynamic databases for solids, solid solutions,
   and gases, these databases permit the calculation of complex multiphase
   equilibria in multicomponent systems, using the FactSage thermochemical
   software. In particular, calculations of interest for the production and
   storage of fertilizers may be performed. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier

   combined with a 32-bit general purpose 5-stage pipelined MIPS processor.
   The AES module used in this paper is fully pipelined. The processor
   fetches an instruction from the instruction memory and sends it to the
   decode stage. If the instruction is the crypto instruction it is pushed
   into the AES module during the decode stage. However if the instruction
   belongs to the MIPS processor, the remaining cycles will be completed on
   the MIPS processor. The parameterized AES module has different latencies
   on different rounds of AES according to the application requirements.
   The effects of different number of rounds on latency, memory, and area

Abstract = {{Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are the closest approach to biological
   neurons in comparison with conventional artificial neural networks
   (ANN). SNNs are composed of neurons and synapses which are
   interconnected with a complex pattern. As communication in such
   massively parallel computational systems is getting critical, the
   network-on-chip (NoC) becomes a promising solution to provide a scalable
   and robust interconnection fabric. However, using NoC for large-scale
   SNNs arises a trade-off between scalability, throughput, neuron/router
   ratio (cluster size), and area overhead. In this paper, we tackle the
   trade-off using a clustering approach and try to optimize the synaptic
   resource utilization. An optimal cluster size can provide the lowest
   area overhead and power consumption. For the learning purposes, a
   phenomenon known as spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is
   utilized. The micro-architectures of the network, clusters, and the
   computational neurons are also described. The presented approach
   suggests a promising solution of integrating NoCs and STDP-based SNNs
   for the optimal performance based on the underlying application.}},

Abstract = {{Graph edit distance is a flexible and powerful measure of dissimilarity
   between two arbitrarily labeled graphs. Yet its application is limited
   by the exponential time complexity involved when matching unconstrained
   graphs. We have recently proposed a quadratic-time approximation of
   graph edit distance based on Hausdorff matching, which underestimates
   the true distance. In order to implement verification systems for the
   approximation algorithm, efficiency improvements are needed for the
   computation of the true distance. In this paper, we propose a Hausdorff
   heuristic that employs the approximation algorithm itself as a heuristic
   function for efficient A{*} computation of the graph edit distance. In
   an experimental evaluation on several data sets of the IAM graph
   database, substantial search space reductions and runtime speedups of
   one order of magnitude are reported when compared with plain A{*}
   search.}},

Abstract = {{Software evolution and development are continuous activities that have a
   never-ending cycle. While developers commit changes on a software system
   to fix bugs or to implement new requirements, they sometimes introduce
   anti-patterns, which are bad solutions to recurring design problems in
   the system. Many previous studies have shown that these anti-patterns
   have negative effects on code quality, in particular fault-proneness.
   However, it is not clear if and how anti-patterns evolve and which
   evolutionary behaviors are more fault-prone. This paper presents results
   from an empirical study aimed at understanding the evolution of
   anti-patterns in 27 releases of three open-source software systems:
   ArgoUML, Mylyn, and Rhino. Specifically, the study analyzes the
   mutations of anti-patterns, the changes that they undergo, and the
   relation between anti-pattern evolution behaviors and fault-proneness.
   Results show that (1) anti-patterns mutate from one type of
   anti-patterns to another, (2) structural changes are behind these
   mutations, and (3) some mutations are more risky in terms of
   fault-proneness.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon-supported PdSn catalysts were synthesized (ratio of about Pd:Sn =
   1:1) by the NaBH4 reduction method for the oxygen reduction reaction
   (ORR) in HClO4 solution. The carbon support surface was previously
   activated with a sensitizing and activating pre-treatment. The
   as-prepared PdSn catalyst was then heat treated at 300 degrees C in
   H-2/N-2 (3 vol.\% H-2). The PdSn catalysts were characterized by
   SEM/EDS, XRD and TEM before and after the heat treatment. The
   electrochemical activity towards ORR was examined by cyclic and rotating
   disk electrode measurements and compared with that of Pd. The ORR
   catalytic activity of PdSn heat treated catalyst was about 25 and 4
   times higher than that of asprepared and Pd catalyst, respectively.
   Accelerated stability test (AST) by repetitive potential cycling
   indicated that PdSn heat treated was very stable in electrochemical
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{The first part of this work reports on detailed studies of the influence
   of both strain and composition on the band structure of GeSiSn ternary
   alloys. First, we developed a simple yet rigorous semi-empirical second
   nearest neighbors tight binding sp(3)s{*} method that incorporates the
   effect of substitutional disorder. We have found that the composition of
   alpha-Sn at the direct to indirect crossover of the ternary alloy
   decreases from 11\% in a fully relaxed alloy to 7\% in tensile strained
   alloy (for a strain value of 0.71\%). In the latter case, we have
   considered a thin GeSiSn layer is epitaxialy grown on a thin Ge
   substrate. The last section of this work addresses the behavior of
   GeSn/Ge core-shell nanowires. Herein, we have solved the effective mass
   Hamiltonian in cylindrical coordinates using a finite difference
   technique for the core-shell nanowires where the core and the shell are
   made of different alloys. We have found that above a critical doping
   concentration of 5x10(16) cm(-3) and below a core radius of 20 nm, the
   electron density is localized in the Ge shell for the Ge0.9Sn0.1/Ge
   core-shell nanowire system.}},

Abstract = {{Sn-containing group IV semiconductors provide a rich playground to
   independently engineer the band structure and lattice parameter with a
   potential impact of a variety of silicon-based electronic and
   optoelectronic devices. The introduction of these metastable alloys in
   device fabrication raises a number of concerns regarding the possible
   degradation of their composition and structural properties during
   different processing steps. With this perspective, in this work we
   present detailed in situ and ex situ investigations of the thermal
   behavior of both Sn-rich binary and ternary alloys. We used low energy
   electron microscopy and photoelectron emission electron microscopy to
   examine in real time the evolution of surface structure and composition
   during thermal annealing. These in situ studies are augmented using
   several ex situ characterization techniques. These investigations
   unraveled unprecedented details about the phase separation in these two
   systems. Particularly, in Ge0.84Si0.04Sn0.12 annealing above 410 degrees
   C leads to the formation of randomly distributed Sn-rich particles which
   grow as the annealing temperature increases. Additionally, the binary
   alloy Ge0.88Sn0.12 seems to be relatively more stable as compared to the
   ternary alloy with the same Sn content. The Sn-rich particles in the
   former system are not randomly distributed, but they are found to follow
   a well defined pattern on the surface along the < 110 > direction. The
   mechanisms and regimes involved in the phase separation are also briefly
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{Most of the recently published background subtraction methods can still
   be classified as pixel-based, as most of their analysis is still only
   done using pixel-by-pixel comparisons. Few others might be regarded as
   spatial-based (or even spatiotemporal-based) methods, as they take into
   account the neighborhood of each analyzed pixel. Although the latter
   types can be viewed as improvements in many cases, most of the methods
   that have been proposed so far suffer in complexity, processing speed,
   and/or versatility when compared to their simpler pixel-based
   counterparts. In this paper, we present an adaptive background
   subtraction method, derived from the low-cost and highly efficient ViBe
   method, which uses a spatiotemporal binary similarity descriptor instead
   of simply relying on pixel intensities as its core component. We then
   test this method on multiple video sequences and show that by only
   replacing the core component of a pixel-based method it is possible to
   dramatically improve its overall performance while keeping memory usage,
   complexity and speed at acceptable levels for online applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel keypoint-based method for visual object
   tracking. To represent the target, we use a new model combining color
   distribution with keypoints. The appearance model also incorporates the
   spatial layout of the keypoints, encoding the object structure learned
   during tracking. With this multi-feature appearance model, our
   Structure-Aware Tracker (SAT) estimates accurately the target location
   using three main steps. First, the search space is reduced to the most
   likely image regions with a probabilistic approach. Second, the target
   location is estimated in the reduced search space using deterministic
   keypoint matching. Finally, the location prediction is corrected by
   exploiting the keypoint structural model with a voting-based method. By
   applying our SAT on several tracking problems, we show that location
   correction based on structural constraints is a key technique to improve
   prediction in moderately crowded scenes, even if only a small part of
   the target is visible. We also conduct comparison with a number of
   state-of-the-art trackers and demonstrate the competitiveness of the
   proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the problem of detecting and tracking multiple
   objects of various types in outdoor urban traffic scenes. This problem
   is especially challenging due to the large variation of road user
   appearances. To handle that variation, our system uses background
   subtraction to detect moving objects. In order to build the object
   tracks, an object model is built and updated through time inside a state
   machine using feature points and spatial information. When an occlusion
   occurs between multiple objects, the positions of feature points at
   previous observations are used to estimate the positions and sizes of
   the individual occluded objects. Our Urban Tracker algorithm is
   validated on four outdoor urban videos involving mixed traffic that
   includes pedestrians, cars, large vehicles, etc. Our method compares
   favorably to a current state of the art feature-based tracker for urban
   traffic scenes on pedestrians and mixed traffic.}},

Abstract = {{North American forest product companies are considering the
   transformation of their businesses by integrating biorefineries into
   their existing pulp and paper facilities. However, not all biorefinery
   strategies are sustainable, and all do not imply the same level of risk.
   To assess biorefinery strategies, it is essential first to identify
   potential integrations between biorefinery candidates and the existing
   mill, and then to evaluate the cost synergies associated with these
   potential integrations. This article describes this approach as a
   retrofit design methodology. Considering the unique characteristics of
   the Kraft pulp mill under study, four biorefinery technologies were
   identified as potential transformation strategies. The main cost savings
   were found to be associated with integration potential at the energy
   island and the waste-water treatment unit. The results of retrofit
   design as used for economic analysis in this study can then be used to
   analyze the candidate biorefinery strategies further in terms of their
   sustainability performance.}},

Abstract = {{The next generation of MPSoC points to the integration of thousands of
   IP cores, requiring high performance interconnect for high throughput
   communications. Optical onchip interconnect enables significantly
   increased bandwidth and decreased latency in MPSoC. However, the
   interface between electrical and photonic devices implies strong layout
   constraints that may impact the system performance and scalability. In
   this paper, we propose a novel optical interconnect named CHAMELEON. The
   interface simplifies the layout and allows the bandwidth between IP
   cores to be adapted according to the communication requirements.
   Compared to related networks, CHAMELEON demonstrates improved
   scalability and flexibility at the cost of minor increase in power

   Polytechnique Montreal, Canada, on the seismic response and design of
   moderately ductile (Type MD) reinforced concrete shear walls subjected

   America (ENA). The first phase of the project included shaking table
   tests performed on two 9 m tall models of 8-storey reinforced concrete
   shear walls designed in accordance with current Canadian code
   provisions. In the second phase, constitutive shear wall models were
   developed using nonlinear reinforced concrete fibre elements implemented
   in the OpenSees (OS) computer program and finite elements using the
   Vector 2 (VT2) computer program. The models were calibrated against
   shake table test data. In the third phase, the models assumptions were
   used to investigate higher mode effects on the seismic response under
   ENA ground motions of twenty four Type MD prototype walls for 5- to
   25-storey buildings with fundamental periods ranging from 0.4 s to 3.0
   s. The walls had base flexural over-strength factor varying from 1.2 to
   2.4. From the results, a new base shear amplification factor is proposed
   to evaluate the seismic shear force demand more realistically for design
   purposes.}},

Abstract = {{The global seismic response of 3- and 8-storey eccentrically braced
   frames (EBFs) with long, flexure-critical links is studied. In spite of
   lesser ductility, EBFs with long links offer more flexible architectural
   arrangements, which can be advantageous for new buildings and for
   seismic retrofits. However, high axial loads and bending moments
   introduced by yielding links into outer beam segments often require
   strengthening of the beam which can be avoided if some yielding is
   admitted in these elements. Limited evidence is available regarding the
   possible extent of this yielding and the impact of this behaviour on the
   overall frame response. The study was carried out for chevron-type
   frames designed for typical western and eastern North-American seismic
   conditions. Attention was directed in particular to the behaviour of the
   links and the outer beam segments. The model for nonlinear time history
   analysis was built using the OpeenSees computer program. Links were
   represented by elastic beam elements with one zero-length rotational
   spring attached at the ends of each link. The inelastic spring behaviour
   was described using Steel02 material. The link model was calibrated
   against experimental results on long links available in literature. The
   outer beams, braces and columns were modeled using nonlinear beam-column
   elements with fiber discretization of the cross section to reproduce
   cross-sectional yielding as well as in-and out-of plane flexural
   buckling. The results show that the amplification factors applied on
   link forces to determine design forces for other frame members appear
   conservative, particularly for eastern location characterized by
   high-frequency ground motions. The results suggest that the flexural
   yielding of outer beam segments is acceptable if combined the flexural
   strength of the brace and beam is at least equal to the link end moment,
   and if the brace can resist the imposed axial-moment demand.}},

Abstract = {{The seismic response of an existing 300m long four-span highway bridge
   supported in the center pier on pile foundation in 30 m of soft soil and
   on two adjacent piers on rock foundation is investigated. The bridge is
   located in Eastern Canada where high frequency ground motions (10Hz) are
   predominant. The following support conditions are considered in
   comparative analyses: fixed-base (as a reference) and piles with
   non-linear Soil Structure Interaction (SSI). The structure is analyzed
   in the longitudinal direction, in which the translational movements
   between the superstructure supports are constrained to those at the top
   of the piers and free at the abutments. Linear and nonlinear
   time-history analyses are performed to evaluate the displacement demand
   and related internal forces. Simulated ground motion records are
   calibrated to match the response spectrum of the upcoming Canadian
   Highway Bridge Design Code (2015). Convolution is used to account for
   the local effect of the soil layer at the central support and
   displacement histories are used to account for multiple support
   excitations. A onedimensional wave propagation method is used to compute
   the soil response. The non-linear bridge model includes for the central
   support piles modeled as a Beam on Non-linear Winkler Foundation with
   p-y soil curves for the springs along their length. Results show an
   influence of site-response (or local soil conditions), as it affects
   internal forces of each column individually. The wave passage effect,
   with an underlying rock speed of 1500 m/s, has irrelevant influence on
   the results. Deck displacements have little variations between the
   different cases considered.}},

Abstract = {{In structural analysis, it is widely accepted that simplified methods,
   that require fewer resources, should produce more conservative results,
   while more sophisticated methods, which require greater resources, allow
   the calculation of more realistic results. For gravity dams, (i)
   pseudo-static methods, (ii) pseudo-dynamic methods, (iii) linear time
   history analysis, and (iv) non-linear time history analysis are common
   techniques. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of
   a progressive analysis methodology, using the four mentioned methods
   (i-iv) for seismic analysis, and define the scope of its applicability.
   The study of 52 gravity dam models, representing dams with different
   heights and properties, was performed by this progressive methodology,
   regarding the stress distribution along the base of the dam, the sliding
   safety factor (SSF) and the permanent sliding of the dam. The results
   show that the pseudo-static method gives a good approximation of the
   SSF, but the stresses are generally lower, when compared with the values
   obtained by more sophisticated methods. The pseudo-dynamic method gives
   a good approximation of the SSF and the stresses on the base of the dam,
   while the linear time history analysis did not give additional
   information for the dams analysed with SSF > 1when compared with the
   pseudo-dynamic method. The nonlinear time history analysis confirms the
   dam behavior against a sliding failure scenario, even after the stress
   redistribution, giving an actual time-history of the SSF and stress
   during an earthquake. The results show that the proposed progressive
   methodology, is a beneficial procedure to conduct gravity dam safety
   assessment.}},

Abstract = {{The delineation of tumor boundaries is an essential task for the
   diagnosis and follow-up of liver cancer. However accurate segmentation
   remains challenging due to tissue inhomogeneity and high variability in
   tumor appearance. In this paper, we propose a semi-automatic liver tumor
   segmentation method that combines a deformable model with a machine
   learning mechanism. More precisely, segmentation is performed by an
   MRF-based omni-directional deformable surface model that uses image
   information together with a two-class (tumor, non-tumor) voxel
   classification map. The classification map is produced by a kernel SVM
   classifier trained on texture features, as well as intensity mean and
   variance. The segmentation method is validated on a metastatic tumor
   dataset consisting of 27 tumors across a set of abdominal CT images,
   using leave-one-out validation. Compared to pure voxel and gradient
   approaches, our method achieves better performance in terms of mean
   distance and Dice scores on the group of 27 liver tumors and can deal
   with highly pathological cases.}},

Abstract = {{A mechatronic product is a complex multi-domain system which integrates
   several disciplines where mechanics are combined with electronics,
   control and software. The task of designing mechatronic systems is
   understood to be very tedious and complex because of the high number of
   components, the multi-physics aspects, the couplings between the
   different domains involved and the interacting design criteria. Due to
   this inherent complexity, a systematic and multi-objective approach is
   needed to replace the traditional methods used to support the design
   activity and design performance evaluation. In this paper we present a
   Choquet integral-based neural network alongside with a new
   multi-criteria profile for mechatronic system performance evaluation in
   conceptual design stage. The newly introduced Mechatronic Multi-criteria
   Profile (MMP) includes various quantitative evaluation criteria such as
   machine intelligence, reliability, complexity, flexibility and cost. The
   Choquet integral-based neural network will be used for the aggregation
   of criteria and fitting the intuitive requirements for decision-making
   in the presence of interacting criteria. Finally, a case study of
   designing a robotic visual servoing system is presented to validate the
   effectiveness of the proposed method.}},

   modelling the creativity process through the design of a Creative

   Challenge and is inspired by actual system engineering modelling
   formalisms and the literature on creativity. The first section will
   discuss CSS support of the ``48h to Generate Ideas (R){''} creativity

Abstract = {{In this article, a new approach is proposed for the manufacture of
   aircraft skin. Based on the optimal designed flatten blank with pockets
   pre-machined, stretch forming process is employed to form the designed

   pockets shapes and thickness value and reduced the machining difficulty
   on the curved surface compared with the traditional method that the
   pockets are machined after the blank deformed. To study the feasibility
   of this method, FEA software was used to conduct the numerical
   simulation to obtain CAD data of the deformed part. Then the profiles of
   the pockets were dispersed with numerous points and the correspondence
   relationships were set up among the designed pockets on flat blank,
   formed pockets and the target pockets. To improve the blank design,
   shape sensitive method was employed by evaluating the offset influence
   of two designed blanks on the formed pockets profiles. It could decrease
   the numbers of iteration in blank design and reduce the shapes
   deviations between the formed pockets profiles and the target pockets
   profiles.}},

Abstract = {{Microfluidic probes are an emerging tool used in a wide range of
   applications including surface biopatterning, immunohistology, and cell
   migration studies. They control flow above a surface by simultaneously
   injecting and aspirating fluids from a pen-like structure positioned a
   few tens of microns above a surface. Rather than confining flows inside
   microchannels they rely on recirculating flow patterns between the probe
   tip and the substrate to create a hydrodynamic flow confinement (HFC)
   zone in which reagents can be locally delivered to the surface. In this
   paper, we provide a theoretical model, supported by numerical
   simulations and experimental data, describing the extent of the HFC as a
   function of the two most important probe operation parameters, the ratio
   of aspiration to injection flow rate, and the distance between probe
   apertures. Two types of probes are studied: two-aperture microfluidic
   probes (MFPs) and microfluidic quadrupoles (MQs). In both cases, the
   model yields very accurate results and suggests a simple underlying
   theory based on 2D potential flows to understand probe operation. We

Abstract = {{Numerous studies of geocoding systems have been used to assign
   geographical coordinates to incident reports identified simply with
   textual address references. These studies have typically focused on the
   level of accuracy achieved by various geocoding systems and found that
   acceptable results can be achieved. Depending on the quality of the
   input data, a match rate between 70\% and 83\% can be expected, with
   varying levels of accuracy. However, few studies have looked at the
   potential of freely available online geocoding services to spatially
   locate traffic crash records. It is proposed that although limitations
   currently exist, services such as the Google Maps API provide sufficient
   functionality and adequate accuracy for use with a wide variety of
   geocoding applications. A case study used traffic crash records from a
   municipality in the province of Quebec, Canada, with the goal of
   quantifying the geocoding results. It was found that although a
   competitive match rate was obtained, manual revision was required to
   ensure that the results returned by the geocoder referred to the same
   intersection that existed in the input address field.}},

Abstract = {{The FactSage (R) package consists of a series of information, database
   and calculation modules that enable one to access pure substances and

   FactSage was originally founded by process pyrometallurgists and has
   since expanded its applications to include hydrometallurgy,
   electrometallurgy, corrosion, glass technology, combustion, ceramics,
   geology, environmental studies, etc. With the various modules one can
   perform a wide variety of thermochemical calculations and generate
   tables and graphs of complex chemical equilibria and phase diagrams for
   multicomponent systems.
   This paper presents examples of recent and current developments in
   FactSage in areas of particular interest to Dr. David Robertson. These
   include both ferrous and non-ferrous processing, as well as
   solidification and refining simulation. The paper also includes

Abstract = {{Variable-stiffness actuator is a very appealing mechatronic design that
   combines the efficiency of stiff actuator in free space with the
   consistency of elastic actuation in contact. The control of such an
   actuation system remains a challenge due to its non-linearity and by the
   fact that it doubles the number of control inputs. In this paper, we
   propose an original control strategy to compute the whole-body movement
   of a complex variable-stiffness robot during dynamic task execution.
   Operational space control is first used to compute both the joint torque
   and stiffness from operational references. A non-linear model-predictive
   controller is then proposed to track at higher frequency these
   references on each joint separately. The effectiveness of this approach
   is then validated on two models of real actuator with adjustable
   stiffness, and finally on an explosive motion to make a humanoid robot
   jump.}},

   independently actuated cables to drive cable robots. Spatial cable
   differentials are constituted of several cables attaching the moving
   platform to the base but all of these cables are pulled by the same
   actuator through a differential system. To this aim, cable differentials
   with both planar and spatial architectures are first described in this
   work and then, their resultant properties on the force distribution is
   presented. Next, a special cable differential is selected and used to
   design the architecture of two incompletely and fully restrained robots.
   Finally, by comparing the workspaces of these robots with their
   classically actuated counterparts, the advantage of using differentials
   on their wrench-closure and wrench-feasible workspaces is illustrated.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated the possible impact of low frequency magnetization
   fluctuations on the equivalent magnetic excess noise of GMI sensors,
   which we have recently shown to exhibit 1/f noise. This noise component
   is not associated with the detailed measuring setup nor with the
   conditioning electronic noise sources, suggesting that it is intrinsic
   to the sensing element. Various intrinsic GMI noise sources might be
   able to explain this observation; these include magnetic domain wall
   motion, hysteresis loop losses, etc. Since GMI elements are excited by a
   high frequency current, it has been assumed that these low frequency
   (lf) intrinsic noise sources cannot interact with the carrier and the
   sensed signal. We recall that the GMI effect is based on an impedance
   variation, which is governed by magnetization angle variations. These
   are modulated by the sensed signal and the lf magnetization noise, which
   then appear as sidebands around the carrier frequency. Applying the
   fluctuation- dissipation theorem to the GMI model, we have related both
   the signal and noise to the magnetic susceptibility spectrum and thus
   quantified the equivalent magnetic noise of GMI sensors at lf. We then
   present a preliminary comparison to our previous experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{A robust multi-fidelity design optimization methodology has been
   developed to integrate advantages of high- and low-fidelity analyses and
   alleviate their weaknesses. The aim of this methodology is to reach more
   efficient turbine runners with respect to different constraints, in
   reasonable computational time and cost. In such a framework, an
   inexpensive low-fidelity (inviscid) solver handles most of the
   computational burden by providing data for the optimizer to evaluate
   objective functions and constraint values in the low-fidelity phase. An
   open-source derivative-free optimizer, NOMAD, explores the search space.
   Promising candidates are selected among all feasible solutions using a
   filtering process. The proposed filtering process accounts for Pareto
   optimal solutions and considers solutions which are different in the
   design variable space and are dominant in their local territories. A
   high-fidelity (viscous) solver is used outside the optimization loop to
   accurately evaluate filtered solutions. Accurate information achieved by
   high-fidelity analyses is also employed to recalibrate the low-fidelity
   optimization.
   The developed methodology demonstrated its ability to redesign a Francis
   turbine blade for a given best efficiency operating condition. The
   original and optimized cases were evaluated and compared for a complete
   range of operating conditions by calculating the efficiency curves and
   losses of different components. The optimal blade has provided an
   efficient runner for the given operating conditions considering the
   design constraints.}},

Abstract = {{Most background subtraction approaches offer decent results in baseline
   scenarios, but adaptive and flexible solutions are still uncommon as
   many require scenario-specific parameter tuning to achieve optimal
   performance. In this paper, we introduce a new strategy to tackle this
   problem that focuses on balancing the inner workings of a non-parametric
   model based on pixel-level feedback loops. Pixels are modeled using a
   spatiotemporal feature descriptor for increased sensitivity. Using the
   video sequences and ground truth annotations of the 2012 and 2014 CVPR
   Change Detection Workshops, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms
   all previously ranked methods in the original dataset while achieving
   good results in the most recent one.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual metrology in quality control deals with drifts in product
   quality that occur during non-sampling periods. This approach enables a
   hundred percent control and improves the precision of statistical
   control, specially while there is no sampling activity in manufacturing
   process. The main challenge in virtual metrology is inaccurate
   predictions. As such, the choice of an appropriate algorithm for
   prediction is crucial. We compare several algorithms that can be used
   for prediction in virtual metrology. The comparison over different
   prediction algorithms is made on a simulated data inspired from virtual

Abstract = {{From an analysis of `prospective' (as a discipline) and the integration
   of its elements into ergonomics, the authors propose to recognize
   Prospective Ergonomics (PE) as a new modality of ergonomic intervention
   that allows one to work on the future. The goal is to bring ergonomics
   to focus on future human needs and usages and the creation of future
   artifacts, and to do it through human and organizational factors that
   are always at the core of its action. Thus, PE is a modality of
   ergonomic intervention which consists in anticipating future needs,
   usages and behaviors, or constructing future needs, in order to create
   products, processes and services that are well suited to them. The
   knowledge and methods of prospective, ergonomics and creativity are
   utilized to search and create. Thus a prospective intervention is
   proactive, speculative, and inventive. It is located upstream of design
   in projects and it provides ergonomists with the opportunity to work at
   the strategic level of enterprises. The authors discuss the issues and
   challenges of PE and describe the outline of eight articles included in
   these two special issues on PE.}},

Abstract = {{LiFePO4/C, LiFe0.98Pd0.02PO4/C, and LiFe0.96Pd0.04PO4/C composite
   cathode materials were synthesized using the sol-gel method. The effect
   of palladium on the structure and electrochemical properties of
   LiFePO4/C have been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
   surface area measurement (BET), charge/discharge testing, and cyclic
   voltammetry (CV). The results indicate that palladium doping facilitates
   the formation of impurities, like Li3PO4. Also, the lattice parameters
   of the LiFePO4 structure decrease in size as the palladium content
   increases. In addition, the particles become larger and agglomerated by
   palladium incorporation. The electrochemical results show that palladium
   doping decreases the electrochemical performance of LiFePO4/C, owing to
   shrinking lattice parameters and the difficulty of achieving the
   diffusion of lithium ions into the structure during the
   intercalation/de-intercalation process. These results suggest that
   palladium doping by sol-gel method changes significantly the LiFePO4
   structure which may impact it performances as cathode for the lithium
   ion battery applications.}},

Pages = {{27-36}},
Abstract = {{The importance of road lighting in improving nighttime safety is
   evident; however, the lack of actual field measurements of illuminance
   results in a gap in knowledge about the adequacy of installed road
   lighting for clear nighttime visibility. Previous studies have
   considered the effect of the presence or absence of road lighting on
   safety, but few have measured actual illuminance. This study tested a
   uniform method for performing a simple road lighting audit and safety
   screening for any area. To perform the proposed audit, a photometric
   sensor, data logger, and information on the city lighting standards,
   georeferenced accident data, and traffic flow data were used. To collect
   field measurements, data collectors crossed each side of an intersection
   with a sensor. On the basis of the collected data, the following values
   were calculated: the average illuminance of each approach to an
   intersection and of the whole intersection and the uniformity ratio of
   the intersection. These results were used to compare the intersection
   illuminance with the city lighting standard to see if the installed road
   lighting was performing adequately. This method was applied to a case
   study in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, where the lighting at 59\% of the
   selected sample intersections was found to be substandard. Statistical
   analysis showed that the number of night accidents was correlated with
   traffic flow and substandard illuminance. The factors contributing to
   average illuminance were clear sky, hour of night, and presence of light
   poles and commercial lights.}},

Abstract = {{A robust multi-fidelity design algorithm has been developed, focusing to
   efficiently handle industrial hydraulic runner design considerations.
   The computational task is split between low- and high-fidelity phases in
   order to properly balance the CFD cost and required accuracy in
   different design stages. In the low-fidelity phase, a derivative-free
   optimization method employs an inviscid flow solver to obtain the major
   desired characteristics of a good design in a relatively fast iterative
   process. A limited number of candidates are selected among feasible
   optimization solutions by a newly developed filtering process. The main
   function of the filtering process is to select some promising candidates
   to be sent into the high-fidelity phase, which have significantly
   different geometries, and also are dominant in their own territories.
   The high-fidelity phase aims to accurately evaluate those promising
   candidates in order to select the one which is closest to design
   targets. A low-head runner case study has shown the ability of this
   methodology to identify an optimized blade through a relatively low
   computational effort, which is significantly different from the base
   geometry.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, computational fluid dynamics is commonly used by design
   engineers to evaluate and compare losses in hydraulic components as it
   is less expensive and less time consuming than model tests. For that
   purpose, an automatic tool for casing and distributor analysis will be
   presented in this paper. An in-house mesh generator and a Reynolds
   Averaged Navier-Stokes equation solver using the standard k-omega SST
   turbulence model will be used to perform all computations. Two solvers
   based on the C++ OpenFOAM library will be used and compared to a
   commercial solver. The performance of the new fully coupled block solver
   developed by the University of Lucerne and Andritz will he compared to
   the standard 1.6ext segregated simpleFoanz solver and to a commercial
   solver. In this study, relative comparisons of different geometries of
   casing and distributor will be performed. The present study is thus
   aimed at validating the block solver and the tool chain and providing
   design engineers with a faster and more reliable analysis tool that can
   be integrated into their design process.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, several investigations on hydraulic turbine draft tube
   performance have shown that the hydrodynamic flow field at the runner
   outlet determines the diffuser efficiency affecting the overall
   performance of the turbine. This flow field, for which the principal
   characteristics are the flow rate and the inlet swirling flow intensity,
   is mostly developed on turbines designed for low head (high specific
   velocity) and operated away from their best efficiency point. To
   identify factors of the flow field responsible for loosing draft- tube
   efficiency, the correlations between the flow pattern along the diffuser
   and both swirl intensity and flow rate have been examined. An analytical
   representation of inlet flow field has been manipulated by a Multi
   Island Genetic Algorithm through the automatic coupling of
   multidisciplinary commercial software systems in order to obtain
   redesigned inlet velocity profiles. This loop allowed determining the
   profile for which the minimum energy loss factor was reached. With
   different flow field patterns obtained during the optimization process
   it was possible to undertake a qualitative and quantitative analysis
   which has helped to understand how to suppress or at least mitigate
   undesirable draft tube flow characteristics. The direct correlation
   between the runner blade design and the kinematics of the swirl at the
   draft tube inlet should suppose the perfect coupling at the runner-draft
   tube interface without compromising the overall flow stability of the
   machine.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an experimental investigation is implemented on the
   abrasive waterjet polishing technique to evaluate its capability in
   polishing of surfaces and edges of hydraulic turbine blades. For this,
   the properties of this method are studied and the main parameters
   affecting its performance are determined. Then, an experimental test-rig
   is designed, manufactured and tested to be used in this study. This
   test-rig can be used to polish linear and planar areas on the surface of
   the desired workpieces. Considering the number of parameters and their
   levels, the Taguchi method is used to design the preliminary
   experiments. All experiments are then implemented according to the
   Taguchi L-18 orthogonal array. The signal-to-noise ratios obtained from
   the results of these experiments are used to determine the importance of
   the controlled polishing parameters on the final quality of the polished
   surface. The evaluations on these ratios reveal that the nozzle angle
   and the nozzle diameter have the most important impact on the results.
   The outcomes of these experiments can be used as a basis to design a
   more precise set of experiments in which the optimal values of each
   parameter can be estimated.}},

Abstract = {{Runaway speed is an `important performance factor for the safe operation
   of hydropower systems. In turbine design, the manufacturers must conduct
   several model tests to calculate the accurate value of runaway speed for
   the complete range of operating conditions, which are expensive and
   time-consuming. To study runaway conditions, the application of
   numerical tools such as unsteady CFD simulations can help to better
   understand the complex flow physics during transient processes. However,
   unsteady simulations require significant computational effort to compute
   accurate values of runaway speed due to difficulties related to unsteady
   turbulent flow modelling and instabilities. The present study presents a
   robust methodology based on steady-state RANS flow simulations capable
   of predicting the runaway speed of a Francis turbine with an adequate
   level of accuracy and in a reasonable simulation time. The simulations
   are implemented using a commercial flow solver and an iterative
   algorithm that relies on a smooth relation between turbine torque and
   speed coefficient. The impact of friction has been considered when
   estimating turbine torque, in order to improve the accuracy. The results
   of this study show good agreement with experiments.}},

Title = {{Naproxen affects osteogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells via
   regulation of Indian hedgehog signaling molecules}},
Journal = {{ARTHRITIS RESEARCH \& THERAPY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: We previously showed that type X collagen, a marker of
   late stage chondrocyte hypertrophy (associated with endochondral
   ossification), is constitutively expressed by mesenchymal stem cells
   (MSCs) from osteoarthritis patients and this may be related to Naproxen
   (Npx), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug used for therapy. Hedgehog
   (HH) signaling plays an important role during the development of bone.
   We tested the hypothesis that Npx affected osteogenic differentiation of
   human MSCs through the expression of Indian hedgehog (IHH), Patched-1
   (PTC1) and GLI family members GLI1, GLI2, GLI3 in vitro.
   Methods: MSCs were cultured in osteogenic differentiation medium without
   (control) or with 0.5 mu M Npx. The expression of collagen type X, alpha
   1 (COL10A1), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteopontin (OPN), osteocalcin
   (OC), collagen type I, alpha 1 (COL1A1) was analyzed with real-time
   reverse transcription (RT) PCR, and the ALP activity was measured. The
   osteogenesis of MSCs was monitored by mineral staining and
   quantification with alizarin red S. To examine whether Npx affects
   osteogenic differentiation through HH signaling, the effect of Npx on
   the expression of IHH, GLI1, GLI2, GLI3 and PTC1 was analyzed with
   real-time RT PCR. The effect of cyclopamine (Cpn), a HH signaling
   inhibitor, on the expression of COL10A1, ALP, OC and COL1A1 was also
   determined.
   Results: When MSCs were cultured in osteogenic differentiation medium,
   Npx supplementation led to a significant decrease in ALP gene expression
   as well as its activity, and had a tendency to decrease mineral
   deposition. It also decreased the expression of COL1A1 significantly. In
   contrast, the gene expression of COL10A1 and OPN were upregulated
   significantly by Npx. No significant effect was found on OC expression.
   The expression of IHH, PTC1, GLI1, and GLI2 was increased by Npx, while
   no significant difference was observed on GLI3 expression. Cpn reversed
   the effect of Npx on the expression of COL10A1, ALP, OPN and COL1A1.
   Conclusions: These results indicate that Npx can affect gene expression
   during osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, and downregulate mineral
   deposition in the extracellular matrix through IHH signaling. Therefore,
   Npx could affect MSC-mediated repair of subchondral bone in OA patients.}},

Abstract = {{Large area graphene growth provides a facile route to the development of
   microwave devices based on the interaction of electromagnetic waves with
   the two dimensional gas of electrons in a graphene sheet. The strength
   of microwave scattering with graphene is determined by an impedance
   mismatch Z sigma whose natural scale is itself determined by the fine
   structure constant alpha = e(2) = (4 pi epsilon(0)(h) over barc).
   Scattering measurements of graphene monolayer loaded waveguides from 17
   Hz to 110 GHz reveal a constant sheet conductance with negligible skin
   effect owing to monolayer atomic thickness. A Drude conductivity tensor
   can be used to describe the microwave scattering of a graphene sheet
   under a static magnetic field bias. Measurement of longitudinal
   conductivity in a Corbino disk geometry can be used to estimate
   mobility. Transverse conductivity leads to Faraday rotation, which can
   be used in hollow waveguide structures to implement a gate voltage
   tunable isolator. As graphene mobility improves, there is potential to
   exploit both classical and quantum effects in non-reciprocal devices.}},

Abstract = {{60 GHz wireless communication systems are promising wireless gigabit
   transmission supports for short-range multimedia communications,
   particularly in niche applications such as in underground mines. In
   order to investigate the behavior of an underground mine channel with a
   5 mm wavelength and with centimetre range surface roughness of the mine
   walls, signal scattering characteristics have been investigated. In this
   paper, the statistical distribution of surface parameters such as
   heights and correlation coefficients are extracted from the
   measurements, in order to quantify the roughness of mine walls.
   Kirchhoff approximation (KA) scattering has been used to characterize
   one single Radar Cross Section scattering behavior. The angular
   dependent received power has been examined from both simulations and
   measurements. As such, this paper develops a KA model, for 60 GHz
   underground mine communications, which is validated by experimental
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Safety measures have always been a main concern in the mining industry
   that, despite the modern practices, utilizes old-fashioned surveillance
   and monitoring systems. Our mission in underground mines stems from the
   profound need of geo-positioning systems that can accurately localize
   endangered miners and their heavy machinery in one of Earth's most harsh
   and rough environments. In underground mines, complex channels'
   responses to wireless transmitted signals challenge traditional
   localization techniques, yet they fail to defeat our innovative,
   cost-effective and accurate fingerprint-based positioning techniques
   that use artificial neural networks (ANNs) and exploit space-time
   diversity. Being among the pioneers in underground communications
   research, we bring forward a more sophisticated and accurate
   fingerprint-based positioning technique that exploits spatial
   transmission diversity in the presence of more than one transmitter T-x
   and/or receiver R-x antenna, such as in the case of single/multiple
   input multiple output (SIMO/MIMO) communication systems. More
   importantly, an advanced study is conducted to reduce the cost of
   fingerprint-acquisition trading off pinpoint accuracy for lower
   complexity and better ANNs' design. By challenging the localization
   system using less data measurements, we prove that ANNs, when properly
   designed, succeed to attain high positioning accuracies even when
   localizing in measurement gaps that were not seen in the training phase.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, data centres have been called out for their particularly high
   energy consumption, which already accounts for 1.5\% of the total global
   electricity consumption and is among the world's fastest growing energy
   consumptions. To reduce the data centres' environmental impacts,
   technologies such as free cooling and sustainable power sources are
   used. Another newly developed strategy to improve the energy efficiency
   of data centres is virtualization, which makes it possible to install
   several operating systems, known as virtual machines (VMs), so that
   several tasks and users can share a single server. To evaluate the
   environmental advantages and burdens of this strategy, assessments tools
   are required. Several studies have already quantified the energetic and
   environmental benefits of virtualization but often only considered the
   use phase and CO2 improvement. This study uses life cycle assessment
   (LCA) to evaluate the environmental impacts of Internet use in
   videoconferencing (VC). Preliminary results show the advantages of
   virtualization in the manufacturing, use and end-of-life phases. Indeed,
   when virtualization is implemented, one server can be allocated to
   several tasks. Therefore, the environmental burden of use and
   manufacturing will be allocated to the various tasks, decreasing the
   impact of each one.}},

   centres, especially in light of the significant potential of renewable
   energy, which can help to curb greenhouse gas emissions. In the green
   sustainable Telco cloud (GSTC) project, an efficient cloud computing
   network would be set up to optimize renewable energy use based on
   several data centres. This study aimed to develop a temporally
   differentiated life cycle assessment (LCA) model, adapted to short-term
   predictions, to provide a regionalized inventory to model electricity
   generation. Purpose of this model is (i) to calculate more accurately
   the carbon emissions of ICT systems and (ii) to minimize the daily
   carbon emissions of the GSTC servers. This paper focuses mainly on the
   electricity generation modelling during the use phase in the context of
   the life cycle assessment methodology. Considering the time scale of the
   model, the difference between the annual fixed average and a shorter
   period may be highly relevant, in particular when assessing the green
   house gases (GHG) emissions of a process such as an ICT system, which
   mainly operates during peak load hours. The time dependent grid mix
   modelling makes it possible to manage the server load migrations between
   data centres on an hourly basis.}},

   metasurface. The second approach is a direct-space approach based on the
   extraction of the susceptibility tensors of the metasurface elements.
   This approach is applied to vectorial field transformation and can be
   used for single or multiple transformations. An example of wave
   transformation by a metasurface is illustrated for each of the two

Abstract = {{Electronic components in space applications are subject to high levels
   of ionizing and particle radiation. Their lifetime is reduced by the
   former (especially at high levels of utilization) and transient errors
   might be caused by the latter. Transient errors can be detected and
   corrected using memory scrubbing. However, this causes an overhead that
   reduces both the availability and the lifetime of the system. In this
   work, we present a mechanism based on dynamic hidden Markov models
   (D-HMMs) that balances availability and lifetime of a multi-resource
   system by estimating the occurrence of permanent faults amid transient
   faults, and by dynamically migrating the computation on excess resources
   when failure occurs. The dynamic nature of the model makes it adaptable
   to different mission profiles and fault rates. Results show that our
   model is able to lead systems to their desired lifetime, while keeping
   availability within the 2\% of its ideal value, and it outperforms
   static rule-based and traditional hidden Markov models (HMMs)
   approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Histology image analysis is widely used in cancer studies since it
   preserves the tissue structure. In this paper, we propose a framework to
   grade metastatic liver histology images based on the spatial
   organization inter and intra regions. After detecting the presence of
   metastases, we first decompose the image into regions corresponding to
   the tissue types (sane, cancerous, vessels and gaps). A sample of each
   type is further decomposed into the contained biological objects
   (nuclei, stroma, gaps). The spatial relations between all the pairs of
   regions and objects are measured using a Force Histogram Decomposition.
   A specimen is described using a Bag of Words model aggregating the
   features measured on all its randomly acquired images. The grading is
   made using a Naive Bayes Classifier. Experiments on a 23 mice dataset
   with CT26 intrasplenic tumors highlight the relevance of the spatial
   relations with a correct grading rate of 78.95\%.}},

Abstract = {{Metal matrix composites (MMCs), as a new generation of materials; have
   proven to be viable materials in various industrial fields such as
   biomedical and aerospace. In order to achieve a valuable modification in
   various properties of materials, metallic matrices are reinforced with
   additional phases based on the chemical and/or physical properties
   required in the in-service operating conditions. The presence of the
   reinforcements in MMCs improves the physical, mechanical and thermal
   properties of the composite; however it induces significant issues in
   the domain of machining, such as high tool wear and inferior surface
   finish. The interaction between the tool and abrasive hard reinforcing
   particles induces complex deformation behaviour in the MMC structure.
   Sever tool wear is technically the most important drawback of machining
   MMCs.
   In this study a statistical model is developed to estimate the mean
   residual life (MRL) of the cutting tool during machining Ti-MMCs.
   Initial wear, steady wear and rapid wear regions in the tool wear curve
   are regarded as the different states in the statistical model. Hence,
   the valuable information regarding the estimated total time spent in
   each state, called the sojourn time, and the transition times between
   the states are obtained from the model.
   In this paper the standard cutting conditions, based on the
   recommendation of the tool supplier, are adopted. Based on a Weibull
   model, the reliability and hazard functions are obtained and are
   utilized in order to calculate the MRL and the sojourn times. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{We present a new method to detect and remove ringing artifacts produced
   by the deconvolution process in image deblurring techniques. The method
   takes into account non-invertible frequency components of the blur
   kernel used in the deconvolution. Efficient Gabor wavelets are produced
   for each non-invertible frequency and applied on the deblurred image to
   generate a set of filter responses that reveal existing ringing
   artifacts. The set of Gabor filters is then employed in a regularization
   scheme to remove the corresponding artifacts from the deblurred image.
   The regularization scheme minimizes the responses of the reconstructed
   image to these Gabor filters through an alternating algorithm in order
   to suppress the artifacts. As a result of these steps we are able to
   significantly enhance the quality of the deblurred images produced by
   deconvolution algorithms. Our numerical evaluations using a ringing
   artifact metric indicate the effectiveness of the proposed deringing
   method.}},

Abstract = {{The need for forecasting the direct and indirect effects of land use and
   transport policies on society, the environment, and the local economy
   has led to the development of integrated land use and transport (LUTI)
   models. The land use and transport policy evaluation is based on point
   estimators of economic sustainability indicators, usually computed at an
   aggregate level (e.g., social welfare) despite the fact that the models
   and simulation are based on the individual. A methodology based on the
   strength of microsimulation in three dimensions (space, time, and
   agents) is presented. By multiple simulation runs of the LUTI model
   UrbanSim, the distributions of inequality and accessibility indicators
   in space and time were generated, and their variance was measured. The
   methodology was first applied in a base case scenario (in which the then
   current trend existed) of the Limmattal region including Zurich,
   Switzerland, and then on a public transport investment scenario. The
   results of the two scenarios were then compared on the basis of actual
   distributions rather than the mean point values of the indicators. The
   proposed methodology differed from the point-based policy evaluation
   frameworks in terms of details and insightfulness that could better
   support the process of informed decision making.}},

Abstract = {{Service Based Systems, composed of Web Services (WSs), offer promising
   solutions to software development problems for companies. Like other
   software artefacts, WSs evolve due to the changed user requirements and
   execution contexts, which may introduce poor solutions-Antipatterns-may
   cause (1) degradation of design and quality of service (QoS) and (2)
   difficult maintenance and evolution. Thus, the automatic detection of
   antipatterns in WSs, which aims at evaluating their design and QoS
   requires attention. We propose SODA-W (Service Oriented Detection for
   Antipatterns in Web services), an approach supported by a framework for
   specifying and detecting antipatterns in WSs. Using SODA-W, we specify
   ten antipatterns, including God Object Web Service and Fine Grained Web
   Service, and perform their detection in two different corpora: (1) 13
   weather-related and (2) 109 financial-related WSs. SODA-W can specify
   and detect antipatterns in WSs with an average precision of more than
   75\% and a recall of 100\%.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a three-dimensional (3D) quadratic partial
   differential equation model of the drug release from a thin film of
   biodegradable polymer to a surrounding medium. Its very innovative
   feature is to go directly from the experimental normalized release
   curves of Lao and Venkatraman {[}J. Control. Release, 130 (2008), pp.
   9-14] to a flux condition at the interface between the polymer and the
   medium that only requires the identification of the two parameters of
   the highly accurate ordinary differential equation model of Blanchet,
   Delfour, and Garon {[}SIAM J. Appl. Math., 71 (2011), pp. 2269-2286]. In
   the context of drug eluting stents, it is a practical and economical
   tool to theoretically and numerically simulate the 3D release of drug
   from the thin polymer film to the integrated wall and lumen of the blood
   vessel for evaluation and design. This approach avoids resorting to
   time-dependent or nonlinear diffusion in the polymer.}},

Abstract = {{Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is a condition that may cause
   significant neurodevelopmental handicap in premature newborns. It is
   characterized by white matter injury, associated with inflammation. This
   work aimed to assess the impact of inflammation on cerebral oxygen
   saturation (sO(2)) using depth-sensitive photoacoustic tomography (PAT).
   The aspects of PVL were reproduced in a rodent model by injection of
   lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the corpus callosum. The results of this
   exploratory work reveal lower sO(2) values in LPS group, as compared to
   sham controls; showing decreased values in the corpus callosum and in
   the left cortex, ipsilateral to the injection site. Inter-hemispherical
   connectivity was not affected by LPS injection, as shown by functional
   connectivity analysis.
   This study supports the use of PAT as a non-invasive tool to assess
   oxygenation values in vivo in the newborn brain.}},

Abstract = {{The thorough characterization of skin samples is a critical step in
   investigating dermatological diseases. The combination of
   depth-sensitive anatomical imaging with molecular imaging has the
   potential to provide vast information about the skin. In this
   proof-of-concept work we present high-resolution mosaic images of skin
   biopsies using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) manually co-registered
   with standard microscopy, bi-dimensional Raman spectral mapping and
   fluorescence imaging.
   A human breast skin sample, embedded in paraffin, was imaged with a
   swept-source OCT system at 1310 nm. Individual OCT volumes were acquired
   in fully automated fashion in order to obtain a large field-of-view at
   high resolution (similar to 10 mu m). Based on anatomical features, the
   other three modalities were manually co-registered to the projected OCT
   volume, using an affine transformation.
   A drawback is the manual co-registration, which may limit the utility of
   this method. However, the results indicate that multiple imaging
   modalities provide complementary information about the sample. This
   pilot study suggests that multi-modal microscopy may be a valuable tool
   in the characterization of skin biopsies.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-modal imaging combining fluorescent molecular tomography (FMT)

   consisting of a fiber plate on the top and bottom sides of the animal
   bed, respectively. In experiment, animal was installed between the two
   plates. Mounting fibers on each plate, transmission measuring could be
   conducted from both sides of the animal. Moreover, an accurate
   fluorescence reconstruction was achieved with MRI-derived anatomical
   guidance. The sensitivity of the FMT system was evaluated with a phantom
   showing that with long fibers, it was sufficient to detect 10nM Cy5.5
   solution with similar to 28.5 dB in the phantom. The system was
   eventually used to image MMP activity involved in atherosclerosis with
   two ATX mice and two control mice. The reconstruction results were in
   agreement with ex vivo measurement.}},

Abstract = {{The present work addresses the problem of chaos control in an

   One of the unstable orbits immersed in the chaotic attractor is
   stabilized in order to produce a sustained oscillation of the movable
   plate composing the microstructure. The orbit is carefully chosen so as
   to produce a high amplitude oscillation. This approach allows the
   enhancement of oscillation amplitude of the resonator at a reduced
   control effort, since the unstable orbit already exists in the system
   and it is not necessary to spend energy to create it. Realistic
   operational conditions of the MEMS are considered including parametric
   uncertainties in the model and constraints due to the difficulty in
   measuring the speed of the plates of the microstructure. A control law
   is constructed recursively by using the technique of backstepping.
   Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to confirm the validity
   of the developed control scheme and to demonstrate the effect of
   controlling orbits immersed in the chaotic attractor.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) benefit from several features, such as
   decision-making, spectrum-awareness and reconfigurability over
   heterogeneous channels. After a link failure due to the appearance of
   primary users or if the channel quality becomes unacceptable, these
   features enable CRNs to perform a spectrum migration to a new channel to
   recover the transmission. In this paper, we propose a general
   hierarchical recovery model in which the heterogeneous channels are
   classified based on their parameters into distinct sets. Instead of
   performing a flat channel search over all channels, the CRN first
   selects a channel set and then performs a spectrum migration over the
   selected set to complete the channel search. The focus of this research
   is the decision procedure for selecting the best channel set to perform
   the recovery mechanism based on the CRNs current state and its knowledge
   concerning the different channel parameters. A general dynamic decision
   model is proposed to find the optimal solution to this problem.
   Additionally, we present three decision-making heuristic algorithms.
   Numerical and simulation results are provided to illustrate the
   significant benefits of the optimal and heuristic decision algorithms
   for channel recovery over heterogeneous channels.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel multiple object tracking framework based on
   multiple visual cues. To build tracks by selecting the best matching
   score between several detections, a set of probability maps is estimated
   by a function integrating templates using a sparse representation and
   color information using locality sensitive histograms. All people
   detected in two consecutive frames are matched with each other based on
   similarity scores. This last task is performed using the comparison of
   two models (sparse apparence and color models). A score matrix is then
   obtained for each model. Those scores are combined by Dempster-Shafer's
   combination rule. To obtain an optimal selection of the best candidate,
   a data association step is achieved using a greedy search algorithm. We
   validated our tracking algorithm on challenging publicly available video
   sequences and we show that we outperform recent state-of-theart methods.}},

Abstract = {{Closed door machining is a strategy for producing a part within
   tolerance using on-machine measurement and automatic process adjustment
   as opposed to manual gauging interventions. This paper presents an
   integrated methodology for compensating errors detected using on-machine
   probing. In a multi-cut process, intermittent probing which is achieved
   through replacing the cutting tool with a touch probe, after each cut,
   can detect machining errors caused by deflection and the tool offset
   error. A cutting compliance coefficient model is used to estimate
   corrections to the tool path at the finishing cut based on a finite
   number of measured errors at discrete locations for previous cuts. The
   model also anticipates compliance changes and the effect of the
   compensated depth of cut. The complex surface to be machined is
   represented by a B-spline model. The compensated tool path is obtained
   from B-spline deformation techniques applied to the initial tool path
   according to the discrete corrections. Milling tests are carried out
   with and without compensation demonstrating a reduction of machining
   error from +140 to +/- 20 mu m.}},

Abstract = {{A simple and highly versatile click chemistry based synthetic strategy
   to develop an ABC type miktoarm star ligand that is conjugated to gold
   nanoshells (GNS) is reported. The surface functionalized multifunctional
   GNS contain lipoic acid (LA) as a model therapeutic agent, poly(ethylene

   tetraethylene glycol (TEG) with a terminally conjugated thiol moiety.
   These GNS have an average size of 40 nm, a shell thickness of 6 nm, a
   well-defined crystal structure lattice (111), and a surface absorption
   plasmon band in the near infrared (NIR) region. The miktoarm star and
   GNS functionalized with this ligand are non-cytotoxic for up to 5 mu g
   mL(-1) concentrations, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells
   internalize more than 85\% of these GNS at 5 mu g mL(-1). Our results
   establish that the biocompatible miktoarm star ligand provides a useful
   platform to synthetically articulate the introduction of multiple

Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{347-385}},
Abstract = {{The cerebrovascular regulation involves highly complex mechanisms to
   assure that the brain is perfused at all times. These mechanisms depend
   on all components of the neurovascular units: neurons, glia, and
   vascular cells. All these cell types can produce nitric oxide (NO), a
   powerful vasodilator through different NO synthases. Many studies
   underlined the key role of NO in the maintenance of resting cerebral
   blood flow (CBF) as well as in the mechanisms that control
   cerebrovascular tone: autoregulation and neurovascular coupling.
   However, although the role of NO in the control of CBF has been largely
   investigated, the complexity of the NO system and the lack of specific
   NO synthase inhibitors led to still unresolved questions such as the
   origin of NO and the pathways by which it controls the vascular tone. In
   this chapter, the role of NO in the regulation of CBF is critically
   reviewed and discussed in the context of the neurovascular unit and the
   general principles of cerebrovascular regulation.}},

Title = {{Three-dimensional printing of freeform helical microstructures: a review}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{18}},
Pages = {{10470-10485}},
Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) printing is a fabrication method that enables
   creation of structures from digital models. Among the different
   structures fabricated by 3D printing methods, helical microstructures
   attracted the attention of the researchers due to their potential in
   different fields such as MEMS, lab-on-a-chip systems, microelectronics
   and telecommunications. Here we review different types of 3D printing
   methods capable of fabricating 3D freeform helical microstructures. The
   techniques including two more common microfabrication methods (i.e.,
   focused ion beam chemical vapour deposition and microstereolithography)
   and also five methods based on computer-controlled robotic direct
   deposition of ink filament (i.e., fused deposition modeling,
   meniscus-confined electrodeposition, conformal printing on a rotating
   mandrel, UV-assisted and solvent-cast 3D printings) and their advantages
   and disadvantages regarding their utilization for the fabrication of
   helical microstructures are discussed. Focused ion beam chemical vapour
   deposition and microstereolithography techniques enable the fabrication
   of very precise shapes with a resolution down to similar to 100 nm.
   However, these techniques may have material constraints (e. g., low
   viscosity) and/or may need special process conditions (e. g., vacuum
   chamber) and expensive equipment. The five other techniques based on
   robotic extrusion of materials through a nozzle are relatively
   cost-effective, however show lower resolution and less precise features.
   The popular fused deposition modeling method offers a wide variety of
   printable materials but the helical microstructures manufactured
   featured a less precise geometry compared to the other printing methods
   discussed in this review. The UV-assisted and the solvent-cast 3D
   printing methods both demonstrated high performance for the printing of
   3D freeform structures such as the helix shape. However, the compatible
   materials used in these methods were limited to UV-curable polymers and
   polylactic acid (PLA), respectively. Meniscus-confined electrodeposition
   is a flexible, low cost technique that is capable of fabricating 3D
   structures both in nano-and microscales including freeform helical
   microstructures (down to few microns) under room conditions using
   metals. However, the metals suitable for this technique are limited to
   those that can be electrochemically deposited with the use of an
   electrolyte solution. The highest precision on the helix geometry was
   achieved using the conformal printing on a rotating mandrel. This method
   offers the lowest shape deformation after printing but requires more
   tools (e. g., mandrel, motor) and the printed structure must be
   separated from the mandrel. Helical microstructures made of
   multifunctional materials (e. g., carbon nanotube nanocomposites,
   metallic coated polymer template) were used in different technological
   applications such as strain/load sensors, cell separators and
   micro-antennas. These innovative 3D microsystems exploiting the unique
   helix shape demonstrated their potential for better performance and more
   compact microsystems.}},

   particular adversary. It thus becomes difficult to produce indicators
   (required for guiding the collection and monitoring process) and
   decision guidance matrices for operational personnel (or automated
   processes) to act in accordance with the system owner's intent. To
   overcome these shortcomings, we propose a more comprehensive and
   deliberate process of intelligence planning: the Intelligence
   Preparation of the Cyber Environment (IPCE), an adaptation of the IPB
   (Intelligence Preparation of the Battlespace/Battlefield) and IPOE
   (Intelligence Preparation of the Operational Environment) processes
   employed by military forces in conventional and unconventional
   conflicts. In the IPB, intelligence planners study the adversary
   (capabilities, intent and history) and analyse the effects of the
   environment (terrain, weather, etc.), in order to identify likely enemy
   Courses of Action (CoA) and indicators that will help determine which
   CoA he is pursuing. The outputs of the IPB are then used to guide
   information collection and analysis, and can help support timely
   operational decision-making. In this paper, we describe how to adapt the
   IPB to intelligence support to Computer Network Operations (i.e.
   defensive cyber operations). The IPCE is complementary to and increases
   the value of traditional risk analysis techniques, by providing a more
   deliberate and rigorous framework for applying them. We highlight how
   some of the military concepts used in the IPB correspond to similar
   terms in cyber security. In particular, we describe how ``weather{''}
   and ``terrain{''} map onto the concepts of ``user{''}, ``traffic{''},
   ``network environment{''}, etc. Then, we demonstrate the IPCE
   methodology with a case study: the defense of a SCADA system. The IPCE
   illustrates how SCADA systems have widely different ``environmental{''}
   features from enterprise systems, and consequently warrant different
   surveillance and defensive postures. We also describe how the analysis
   of likely CoA's for a nation-state adversary targeting the SCADA
   infrastructure leads to the identification of important indicators of
   impending attack. Finally, we highlight how, unlike in the physical
   world, the defender has an important advantage in that he ``owns{''} and
   can partially control the terrain. Applying certain engineering
   principles, such as ``design for observability{''} could help the
   defender shape the cyber environment to his advantage by forcing the
   enemy into unfavourable CoA's.}},

Abstract = {{In this report, we investigate numerically the thermodynamics of hollow
   gold nanoshell (AuNS) irritated by near-infrared (NIR) light.
   Simulations are performed for the AuNS in aqueous medium. The
   nanostructure is illuminated by a nanosecond pulsed laser at plasmonic
   resonance. The spatiotemporal evolution of the temperature profile
   inside and outside the AuNS is computed using a numerical framework
   based on the finite element method (FEM). In particular, we show how the
   temperature varies with the laser fluence and pulse duration. The aim of
   this study is to provide a description of the physics of heat release of
   AuNSs and useful insights for the development of these nanostructures
   for biomedical applications such as drug delivery, photothermal cancer
   therapy and optoporation of cells.}},

Abstract = {{Children's potential for exposure to potentially toxic elements in
   contaminated jewelry and toys via mouth contact has not yet been fully

   plastic toys, toys with paint or coating, and brittle/pliable toys; n =
   32) were tested using the saliva extraction (mouthing) compartment of
   the DIN and RIVM bioaccessibility protocols to assess As, Ba, Cd, Cr,
   Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb, and Se mobilization via saliva. Total concentrations
   of As, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Sb were found elevated in analyzed samples.
   Four metals were mobilized to saliva from 16 MJ in significant
   quantities (> 1 mu g for highly toxic Cd and Pb, > 10 mu g for Cu and
   Ni). Bioaccessible concentrations and hazard index values for Cd
   exceeded limit values, for young children between 6 mo- and 3 yr-old and
   according to both protocols. Total and bioaccessible metal
   concentrations were different and not always correlated, encouraging the
   use of bioaccessibility for more accurate hazard assessments.
   Bioaccessibility increased with increasing extraction time. Overall, the
   risk from exposure to toxic elements via mouthing was high only for Cd
   and for MJ. Further research on children's exposure to toxic elements
   following ingestion of toy or jewelry material is recommended.}},

Volume = {{52}},

Abstract = {{Production control policy and economic sampling plan design problems
   have been studied separately in previous research. This paper considers
   a joint production control policy and economic single sampling plan
   design for an unreliable batch manufacturing system. The production is
   controlled by a modified hedging point policy which consists of building
   and maintaining a safety stock of finished product to avoid shortages
   during corrective maintenance. The main objective of this paper is to
   determine simultaneously the economic production quantity, the optimal
   safety stock level and the economic sampling plan design which minimise
   the expected overall cost. A stochastic mathematical model is developed
   and solved using a simulation optimisation approach based on the
   response surface methodology. Simulation is used to imitate the complex
   dynamic and stochastic behaviour of processes as in the real-life
   industrial systems. The obtained results show clearly strong
   interactions between production quantity, inventory state and sampling
   plan design which confirm the necessity of jointly considering
   production and quality control parameters in an integrated model.
   Moreover, it is shown a significant impact of production system
   reliability on the economic sampling plan design and therefore on the
   quality of finished product delivered to consumers. Numerical example
   and sensitivity analyses are presented for illustrative purposes.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{14}},
Pages = {{4118-4131}},
Abstract = {{Aim: Recent mediatic recalls of products illustrate the losses in terms
   of cost and reputation induced by non-conformities reaching end
   customer. The purpose of this paper is to master the propagation of
   quality non-conformities in manufacturing processes. Most of the time,
   the control methods implemented to ensure the quality performance of a
   production system present weaknesses, inherent to their constitution.
   They can let non-conformities propagate along the value stream and even
   to the end customer inducing costly recalls for manufacturer. This paper
   presents a method to master non-conformities propagation in a production
   system. Method: In order to calibrate the proposition, two case studies
   have been issued on non-conformities propagation in a low-volumes
   industry in the energy field. Results: The proposed method combines two
   levels of analysis and associated improvement tools. At the event level,
   it proposes to build the control chart associated with the
   non-conformities propagation distance. At the system level, it proposes
   a propagation matrix to analyse the permeability of the global detection
   system and to identify where improvement effort has to be driven.
   Conclusion: The empirical results of the case studies indicate that the
   method is adapted in low-volume contexts.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of reliability analysis of in-service
   identical systems when a limited number of lifetime data is available
   compared to censored ones. Lifetime (resp. censored) data characterise
   the life of failed (resp. non-failed) systems in the sample. Because,
   censored data induce biassed estimators of reliability model parameters,
   a methodology approach is proposed to overcome this inconvenience and
   improve the accuracy of the parameter estimation based on Bayesian
   inference methods. These methods combine, in an effective way, system's
   life data and expert opinions learned from failure diagnosis of similar
   systems. Three Bayesian inference methods are considered: Classical
   Bayesian, Extended Bayesian and Bayesian Restoration Maximisation
   methods. Given a sample of lifetime data, simulated according to prior
   opinions of maintenance expert, a sensibility analysis of each Bayesian
   method is performed. Reliability analysis of critical subsystems of
   Diesel locomotives is established under the proposed methodology
   approach. The relevance of each Bayesian inference methods with respect
   to collected reliability data of critical subsystems and expert opinions

Abstract = {{In a ``sandwich{''} enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) designed

   usually captured via an antibody adsorbed to the wells of a microplate.
   Plate preparation for standard assay involves a passive adsorption of
   capture antibodies followed by the incubation of blocking agents. Here,
   we describe a new strategy that replaces these two time-consuming
   adsorption steps (up to 15 h) by a unique step corresponding to the
   covalent grafting of the capture antibody on a carboxymethylated dextran
   (CMD) layer, a single step completed in 15 min. Taking advantage of the
   CMD low-fouling properties, blocking agent-free buffer solutions can be
   used as diluent in the improved approach.}},

   customization of clothing within the context of trade globalization,
   which has led to ever more ferocious competition in the apparel
   industry. But, why is the apparel manufacturing industry so late in
   understanding this? This paper outlines and discusses the possible
   causes of the delays of mass customization in the apparel and fashion
   industry. The study first identifies (based on a number of interviews
   with apparel producers) the performance indicators and the integration
   of technologies necessary for the implementation of a system of mass
   customization in the clothing industry. The interviews with these
   producers reveal certain factors and characteristics that can explain
   this delay. The principal cause is the lack of integration between
   technologies currently in place and those offered by suppliers that do
   not adequately respond to the needs of manufacturers and distributers.}},

Title = {{Use of Subway Smart Card Transactions for the Discovery and Partial
   Correction of Travel Survey Bias}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2405}},
Pages = {{57-67}},
Abstract = {{Although the theoretical sources of bias in travel surveys have been
   documented, data that describe an entire population of travelers rarely
   permit the reliable detection and measurement of bias. The existence of
   large databases of smart card transactions in public transit systems
   presents an opportunity to do so. In this paper, a typical average
   weekday of travel demand data from the Montreal, Canada, household
   travel survey is confronted with a single, specific day of smart card
   transactions. The object of comparison is the Montreal subway system,
   which is involved in 10\% of all daily trips within the metropolitan
   area. The results of the initial analysis indicate that although the
   survey accurately reproduces daily subway ridership, it overestimates
   subway boardings by 24\% during peak periods. This overestimation can be
   corrected by adjusting the weights of home-based trips to match entry
   volumes at subway stations during the morning peak period. The results
   of the reweighting procedure suggested that francophone households that
   use transit had a greater propensity to respond to the survey compared
   with other households. Furthermore, even after reweighting, the travel
   survey underestimated off-peak demand by roughly 21\%. The
   underestimation was likely attributable to underreporting of non
   home-based trips by respondent households and nonnsponse of specific
   population groups.}},

   SEARCH ALGORITHMS}},
Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON OPTIMIZATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{The mesh adaptive direct search (MADS) class of algorithms is designed
   for non-smooth optimization, where the objective function and
   constraints are typically computed by launching a time-consuming
   computer simulation. Each iteration of a MADS algorithm attempts to
   improve the current best-known solution by launching the simulation at a
   finite number of trial points. Common implementations of MADS generate
   2n trial points at each iteration, where n is the number of variables in
   the optimization problem. The objective of the present work is to
   dynamically reduce that number. We present an algorithmic framework that
   reduces the number of simulations to exactly n + 1, without impacting
   the theoretical guarantees from the convergence analysis. Numerical
   experiments are conducted for several different contexts; the results
   suggest that these strategies allow the new algorithms to reach a better
   solution with fewer function evaluations.}},

Title = {{Low voltage electrolyte-gated organic transistors making use of high
   surface area activated carbon gate electrodes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{28}},
Pages = {{5690-5694}},
Abstract = {{In electrolyte-gated transistors, the exceptionally high capacitance of
   the electrical double layer forming at the electrolyte/transistor
   channel interface permits current modulations of several orders of
   magnitude, at relatively low gate voltages. The effect of the nature of
   the gate electrode on the performance of electrolyte-gated transistors
   is still largely unclear, despite recent intensive efforts. Here we
   demonstrate that the use of high surface area, low cost, activated
   carbon gate electrode enables low voltage (sub-1 V) operation in ionic
   liquid-gated organic transistors and renders unnecessary the presence of
   an external reference electrode to monitor the channel potential, thus
   dramatically simplifying the device structure. We used the organic
   electronic polymer MEH-PPV
   (poly{[}2-methoxy-5-(2'-ethylhexyloxy)-p-phenylene vinylene), as the
   channel material, and the high ionic conductivity, low viscosity ionic
   liquid {[}EMIM]{[}TFSI] (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
   bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide), as the electrolyte gating material.
   We believe that this will prove to be the first of a new generation of
   low voltage electrolyte-gated transistors for applications in organic
   printable electronics.}},

Title = {{How to repel hot water from a superhydrophobic surface?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{27}},
Pages = {{10639-10646}},
Abstract = {{Superhydrophobic surfaces, with water contact angles greater than 150
   degrees and slide angles less than 10 degrees, have attracted a great
   deal of attention due to their self-cleaning ability and excellent
   water-repellency. It is commonly accepted that a superhydrophobic
   surface loses its superhydrophobicity in contact with water hotter than
   50 degrees C. Such a phenomenon was recently demonstrated by Liu et al.
   {[}J. Mater. Chem., 2009, 19, 5602], using both natural lotus leaf and
   artificial leaf-like surfaces. However, our work has shown that
   superhydrophobic surfaces maintained their superhydrophobicity, even in
   water at 80 degrees C, provided that the leaf temperature is greater
   than that of the water droplet. In this paper, we report on the
   wettability of water droplets on superhydrophobic thin films, as a
   function of both their temperatures. The results have shown that both
   the water contact and slide angles on the surfaces will remain unchanged
   when the temperature of the water droplet is greater than that of the
   surface. The water contact angle, or the slide angle, will decrease or
   increase, however, with droplet temperatures increasingly greater than
   that of the surfaces. We propose that, in such cases, the loss of
   superhydrophobicity of the surfaces is caused by evaporation of the hot
   water molecules and their condensation on the cooler surface.}},

Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{27}},
Pages = {{4250-4261}},
Abstract = {{Superparamagnetic carbon-encapsulated iron carbide nanoparticles (NPs),
   Fe7C3@C, with unique properties, were produced from pure ferrocene by
   high pressure-high temperature synthesis. These NPs combine the merits
   of nanodiamonds and SPIONs but lack their shortcomings which limit their
   use for biomedical applications. Investigation of these NPs by X-ray
   diffraction, electron microscopy techniques, X-ray spectroscopic and
   magnetic measurement methods has demonstrated that this method of
   synthesis yields NPs with perfectly controllable physical properties.
   Using magnetic and subsequent fractional separation of magnetic NPs from
   residual carbon, the aqueous suspensions of Fe7C3@C NPs with an average
   particle size of similar to 25 nm were prepared. The suspensions were
   used for in vitro studies of the interaction of Fe7C3@C NPs with
   cultured mammalian cells. The dynamics of interaction of the living
   cells with Fe7C3@C was studied by optical microscopy using time-lapse
   video recording and also by transmission electron microscopy. Using
   novel highly sensitive cytotoxicity tests based on the cell
   proliferation assay and long-term live cell observations it was shown
   that the internalization of Fe7C3@C NPs has no cytotoxic effect on
   cultured cells and does not interfere with the process of their mitotic
   division, a fundamental property that ensures the existence of living
   organisms. The influence of NPs on the proliferative activity of
   cultured cells was not detected as well. These results indicate that the
   carbon capsules of Fe7C3@C NPs are air-tight which could offer great
   opportunities for future use of these superparamagnetic NPs in biology
   and medicine.}},

Abstract = {{The power law logistic model was utilized to investigate the growth of a
   hydrocarbon assimilating bacterium on a water-insoluble substrate. To
   achieve this end, population dynamics of Bacillus licheniformis MS3 in a
   medium containing n-decane as the sole carbon source was monitored for
   30 h. Different initial biosurfactant concentrations and shaking rates
   were employed to examine the role of mass transfer in the cell growth
   and the consequent hydrocarbon biodegradation. The amount of n-decane
   degraded in the system was detected by gas chromatography at the end of
   the incubation period. The results revealed that when mass transfer
   limitations were lessened through addition of an initial biosurfactant
   concentration and agitation, the bacterial growth increased more than
   three times and the n-decane biodegradation was enhanced from 6.7 to
   15.1 mg/100 mL. Finally, the power law logistic model proved to be
   highly capable in simulating both the experimental results and various
   systems with water-insoluble carbon sources.}},

   compute lower extremity muscle forces and knee joint stresses-strains
   during the stance phase of gait. The model was driven by gait data on OA
   patients, and results were compared with those of the same model driven
   by data on normal controls. Additional analyses were performed with
   altered cartilage-menisci properties to evaluate the effects of
   deterioration during OA. In OA patients compared to normal subjects,
   muscle forces dropped at nearly all stance periods except mid-stance.
   Force in the anterior cruciate ligament remained overall the same. Total
   contact forces-stresses deceased by about 25\%. Alterations in
   properties due to OA had negligible effects on muscle forces, but
   increased contact areas and cartilage strains and reduced contact
   pressures. Reductions in contact stresses and increases in tissue
   strains and transfer of load via menisci are partly due to the altered
   kinetics-kinematics of gait and partly due to deterioration in
   cartilage-menisci properties in OA patients. (C) 2013 Orthopaedic

Abstract = {{Currently, there are a number of nucleus replacements under development.
   The important concern is how well these implants duplicate the
   mechanical function of the native nucleus. This finite element model
   study aimed to investigate the influence of different nucleus
   replacements on the mechanical response of the disc. Models included
   partial, full, over-sized, partially saturated, elastic and poroelastic
   solid replacements. Over-sized nucleus replacements up to 25\% yielded
   results that were comparable to those in the intact state. Differences
   were much greater in cases with under-sized nucleus replacements. The
   effect was most pronounced for the 75\% under-sized replacement that
   resembled the condition with a full nucleotomy. Nucleus implants with
   elastic properties substantially altered load transmission when 10\%
   under-sized and over-sized replacements were considered. Compared to
   intact, the under-sized implants should be avoided when using biphasic
   materials with properties similar to the native nucleus, whereas for
   elastic replacements both under-and over-sized implants should not be
   used.}},

Abstract = {{In this letter, a simple and compact Yagi-Uda antenna with good antenna
   gains is proposed for multiband radar applications. The prototype
   operates in three different frequency bands, namely 1.9, 2.5, and 3.5

   configuration with embedded L-shaped slotlines. On the other hand,
   directors and reflector are deployed to achieve good directivity over
   frequency bands of interest. From measurements, the prototype
   demonstrates high performance of the designed multiband Yagi-Uda antenna
   and also shows a good agreement between measurements and simulations.
   Measured operating frequencies are 1.89, 2.54, and 3.51 GHz,
   respectively, and the realized antenna gains are 6.29, 4.63, and 6.77
   dBi, correspondingly. Measured front-to-back ratios are better than 10.8

Journal = {{IEEE ANTENNAS AND WIRELESS PROPAGATION LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{13}},
Pages = {{971-974}},
Abstract = {{In this letter, triangular ring (TRG) antennas are proposed for
   dual-frequency dual-polarization (DFDP) and circular-polarization (CP)
   operations. By simultaneously exciting the two orthogonal modes of the
   TRG, the DFDP or CP performance is achieved. By varying the vertex angle
   of the TRG, the frequency ratio (FR) of the two orthogonal modes could
   be continuously tunable for the DFDP operation. By moving the FR close
   to 1, a CP antenna element is developed for the sequential-rotation
   array. Due to the geometry advantage of the TRG, the array could be
   designed to have a low sidelobe level (SLL). Measured results show that
   an overlapped bandwidth (of return loss, axial ratio, and gain) of 10\%
   and an SLL of below -20 dB are achieved. The fabricated 120 degrees TRG
   (for the DFDP operation) and the 75 degrees TRG (for the CP operation)
   are 28.2\% and 65.5\% the size of the conventional equilateral
   triangular patch antenna, respectively.}},

Journal = {{PRODUCTION PLANNING \& CONTROL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1039-1057}},
Abstract = {{The major purpose of this paper is to present a concept for reliable
   planning of the sales of small firms, where the large number of product
   variants complicates the implementation of this kind of system
   considerably. First, a methodology is presented to set up sales
   forecasting so that it can be integrated into the inventory management
   process. This inventory management software interprets forecasting
   information and provides users with a decision support system to
   minimize stocks in stores while at the same time avoiding missed sales.
   It is best applied in company types requiring high precision
   inventories, notably those in the textile industry; a large range of
   patterns are produced with many small variations (colors, size,
   customizations, etc.) and these products have a limited lifetime.
   Inventory management is difficult due to the multitude of products to
   account for and the necessity to sell them quickly. The methodology is
   intended for inventory management at the end of the supply chain. In
   store, the number of references, their similarities and the necessity to
   minimize unsold stock greatly complicates the reordering and restocking
   process. These types of companies do not easily lend themselves to
   classic techniques of sales forecasting and require specialized methods
   to estimate their needs precisely.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SPINAL CORD MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{Background: Functional electrical stimulation (FES) has been found to be
   effective in restoring voluntary functions after spinal cord injury
   (SCI) and stroke. However, the central nervous system (CNS) changes that
   occur in as a result of this therapy are largely unknown.
   Objective: To examine the effects of FES on the restoration of voluntary
   locomotor function of the CNS in a SCI rat model.
   Methods: SCI rats were instrumented with chronic FES electrodes in the
   hindlimb muscles and were divided into two groups: (a) FES therapy and
   (b) sedentary. At day 7 post-SCI, the animals were assessed for
   locomotion performance by using a Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB)
   scale. They were then anesthetized for a terminal in vivo experiment.
   The lumbar spinal cord and somatosensory cortex were exposed and the
   instrumented muscles were stimulated electrically. Associated
   neurovascular responses in the CNS were recorded with an intrinsic
   optical imaging system.
   Results: FES greatly improved locomotion recovery by day 7 post-SCI, as
   measured by BBB scores (P < 0.05): (a) FES 10 +/- 2 and (b) controls 3
   +/- 1. Furthermore, the FES group showed a significant increase (P <
   0.05) of neurovascular activation in the spinal cord and somatosensory
   cortex when the muscles were stimulated between 1 and 3 motor threshold
   (MT).
   Conclusion: Hind limb rehabilitation with FES is an effective strategy
   to improve locomotion during the acute phase post-SCI. The results of
   this study indicate that after FES, the CNS preserves/acquires the
   capacity to respond to peripheral electrical stimulation.}},

Title = {{Dynamical stability analysis of a hose to the sky}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{226-234}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The Stratospheric Shield was proposed as a geoengineering concept to
   control the Earth's climate and reverse global warming. This approach
   seeks to release sulphur dioxide (SO2) aerosols in the stratosphere to
   decrease the amount of sunlight that reaches the surface of the Earth.
   It was proposed that this can be done by pumping liquefied SO2 from the
   ground to the stratosphere in a 30 km long hose supported by aerostats.
   In this paper we evaluate the dynamic stability of a hose to the sky
   considering distributed supportive aerostats and an atomiser nozzle that
   forces a radial discharge of the fluid at the free end of the pipe. We
   modelled the pipe as a taut string conveying fluid using the finite
   element method.
   With a nozzle that discharges the flow straight through, we found that
   the pipe loses stability by buckling when the tension becomes null at
   least at one location along its length. This instability can be avoided
   by having a sufficient minimum tension To throughout the whole length of
   the pipe. The distribution of aerostats does not influence this
   instability but it modifies the mode shapes and affects the complex
   frequencies. The atomiser discharging the flow radially at the tip of
   the pipe has for effect to remove the possibility of an instability; its
   use is thus recommended. Moreover, we showed that the Coriolis damping
   can be significant and that by appropriately selecting the number of
   aerostats as well as the dimensionless flow velocity, stability can be
   increased. With this in mind, a functional hose to the sky could be
   designed to maximise Coriolis damping and thus passively damp the motion
   of the pipe due to forcing from the wind. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Femtosecond (fs) laser generation of submicron bubbles around plasmonic
   nanoparticles (NPs) plays a key role in advanced laser nanosurgery
   applications such as cell membrane perforation and cell transfection. In
   this context, we have developed a pump-probe shadowgraphic ultrafast
   imaging technique capable of tracking transient bubbles generated by fs
   irradiation (lambda= 800 nm, tau = 45 fs) of: (a) plasmonic NPs in
   suspensions and (b) plasmonic NPs attached to cells. The laser fluence
   was systematically varied from 100 mJ/cm(2) to 500 mJ/cm(2) to study the
   effect on the bubble dynamics generated around 100 nm gold NPs (Au NPs).
   The plasmonic bubble (PB) generation threshold as well as the NPs
   deformation threshold were defined. Dark field (DF) imaging and scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) revealed NP clustering when 100 nm bare Au NPs
   were incubated with a cancer cell culture. NP clustering was correlated
   with PB generation using a combined pump-probe and DF imaging approach
   The clustering effect resulted in a significant 4-times decrease to the
   PB generation threshold compared to single NPs. The clustering effect
   was further investigated by evaluating bare and polyethylene glycol
   (PEG) functionalized NPs in terms of PB generation efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{The work presented here deals with in-cabin aircraft wireless channel
   characterization in a short-range aircraft. Both large-scale and
   small-scale parameters were extracted for 2.45 GHz and 5.8 GHz frequency
   bands. Results are analyzed and compared for multiple scenarios and for
   both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) situations. The
   mean path-loss exponents are 1.9 for 2.45 GHz and 1.6 for 5.8 GHz
   frequency bands which is different from some previous results obtained
   in relatively wide-body aircrafts. The mean coherence bandwidth
   determined for 2.45 GHz is 760 kHz while for 5.8 GHz it corresponds to
   970 kHz. RMS delay-spread mean values lie around 19 to 33 ns for the
   lower band and 16 to 25 ns for the higher band. The statistical analysis
   revealed a delay-spread following lognormal distribution. Finally, the
   Rice model for LOS scenario, showed a better fit for the multipath
   fading envelope with an average K-factor of 8.5 dB and 11 dB for 2.45
   GHz and 5.8 GHz, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Although Yb:YAG has been cooled in a vacuum environment(1), we report
   for the first time an experimental demonstration of optical cooling at
   atmospheric pressure. A Yb: YAG crystal is supported on thin silica
   fibers, inside a matt-black chamber with air at atmospheric pressure,
   and pumped at 1029 nm in the pulsed and CW regimes. Direct measurement
   of the crystal surface temperature during pumping was made possible by
   using a low thermal-mass, transparent fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor.
   The FBG interrogation system has sufficient sensitivity to measure the
   background absorption of the sample to below 10(-4) cm(-1), and bulk
   cooling at a pump power as low as 17 mW. The dynamical measurement of
   the temperature allows the determination of the overall heat transfer
   coefficient of the sample in the air, of 22 W.m(-2) K-1. A temperature
   drop of 8.8 K from the chamber temperature is observed in the Yb:YAG
   crystal in air when pumped with 4.2 W at 1029 nm, close to 8.9 K
   observed in vacuum(1). A background absorption alpha(b) = 2.9 x 10(-4)
   cm(-1) is estimated with a pump wavelength at 1550 nm. Simulations
   predict further cooling when the sample's cross sectional area and the
   pump power are optimized, including absorption saturation effects. The
   choice of an efficient geometry, the use of a readily available
   temperature sensor in less controlled environments should simplify
   implementation of laser cooling systems and the development of
   commercial devices.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid processes coupling the use of powder activated carbon (PAC) with
   membrane filtration for drinking water production are emerging as
   promising alternatives to conventional technologies due to their
   enhanced control of dissolved contaminants. The quantification of
   biomass colonizing PAC is crucial for modeling, designing control
   strategies and improving the overall performance of these processes. The
   aim of this study was to examine the applicability of several common
   methods developed for colonized granular activated carbon (GAC) to PAC.
   Six analytical methods (based on the measurement of proteins,
   polysaccharides, heterotrophic plate counts, potential glucose
   respiration, bacterial ATP and a potential acetate uptake rate, which is
   proposed herein) were compared. The results showed that the rates of
   glucose respiration and of acetate consumption could be used
   interchangeably. Proteins were also an interesting alternative for
   on-site measurements. It was concluded that biological PAC-based
   processes sustained a level of heterotrophic activity similar to or
   greater than that observed in GAC biofilters.}},

Volume = {{24}},

Pages = {{49-83}},
Abstract = {{Interior-point methods feature prominently among numerical methods for
   inequality-constrained optimization problems, and involve the need to
   solve a sequence of linear systems that typically become increasingly
   ill-conditioned with the iterations. To solve these systems, whose
   original form has a nonsymmetric 3x3 block structure, it is common
   practice to perform block elimination and either solve the resulting
   reduced saddle-point system, or further reduce the system to the Schur
   complement and apply a symmetric positive definite solver. In this paper
   we use energy estimates to obtain bounds on the eigenvalues of the
   matrices, and conclude that the original unreduced matrix has more
   favorable eigenvalue bounds than the alternative reduced versions. Our
   analysis includes regularized variants of those matrices that do not
   require typical regularity assumptions.}},

Abstract = {{The North American newsprint industry is facing a difficult financial
   situation due to a major market decline. The application of supply chain
   management concepts could greatly help this struggling industry by
   enhancing the cost-effectiveness of operations. In this paper, an
   integrated tactical planning model based on optimization was used to
   exploit manufacturing flexibility in order to adapt production to
   changing market conditions. This model was applied to a real case study
   of a newsprint mill with overcapacity in its thermomechanical and
   deinking pulping lines. Results show that by using a margins-based
   planning model to identify better-adapted operating policies in case of
   varying wood chips and recycled paper prices, earnings before interest,
   taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) can be increased by up to
   35\%. The benefits of exploiting manufacturing flexibility were found to
   be more important in difficult market scenarios, highlighting its
   pertinence for providing more-robust planning approaches. Pulp and paper
   companies would benefit from using a margins-based planning model to
   manage the complexity of their operations in the face of market

Abstract = {{The proof of concept of a non-invasive reflection-type void measurement
   system using microwaves is developed. Before constructing the
   instrument, governing equations are used to perform numerical
   simulations of different electrical components (reflectometer, antenna,
   etc.). Design and preliminary calibrations are performed based on these
   simulations. The results are then used to manufacture a setup that is
   installed on a Plexiglas vertical tube containing known volumetric
   fractions of gas in water at atmospheric conditions. The amount of
   injected gas and water are accurately controlled and the response of the

   such a system to study two-phase water-air mixtures. (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{Radial flow reactors (RFR) are used in thermal swing adsorption (TSA)
   processes for gas prepurification. The aim of this work is to show the
   validity of the discrete element method (DEM) to simulate the effect of
   thermal expansion and contraction cycles occurring in such processes on
   the packed bed of RFR reactors. Both mono-layered and bi-layered packed
   beds of adsorbents are investigated. A DEM-based model of a full-scale
   size unit was developed, the parameters of which were calibrated by
   means of particle-scale experimental measurements and simple auxiliary
   DEM simulations. The DEM-based model used is isothermal and the thermal
   expansion and contraction phenomena are modelled through the
   displacement of the inner and outer walls of the computational domain.
   First, the accuracy of this model is assessed using analytical values of
   the static wall pressure (i.e. with no wall motion) as well as
   experimental measurements of the dynamic wall pressure (i.e. with wall
   motion) of a bi-layered bed. Next, simulation results for a few process
   cycles in the case of a bi-layered packed bed indicates that little
   mixing occurs at the interface between the two types of adsorbents. To
   our knowledge, this is the first time that simulation is used to
   investigate the behavior of the packed bed of a RFR in a TSA process.
   The results obtained with the proposed model show that the DEM is a
   valuable tool for the investigation of such slow dynamical processes,
   provided a careful calibration is done.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The ratio of total lumbar rotation over pelvic rotation
   (lumbopelvic rhythm) during trunk sagittal movement is essential to
   evaluate spinal loads and discriminate between low back pain and
   asymptomatic population.
   Methods: Angular rotations of the pelvis and lumbar spine as well as
   their sagittal rhythm during forward flexion and backward extension in
   upright standing of eight asymptomatic males are measured using an
   inertial tracking device. The effect of variations in the lumbopelvic
   ratio during trunk flexion on spinal loads is quantified using a
   detailed musculoskeletal model.
   Findings: The mean of peak voluntary flexion rotations of the thorax,
   pelvis, and lumbar was 121 degrees (SD 9.9), 53.0 degrees (SD 52), and
   60.2 degrees (SD 8.6), respectively. The mean lumbopelvic ratios
   decreased from 2.51 in 0-30 degrees of trunk flexion to 1.34 in 90-120
   degrees range during forward bending while it increased from 123 in
   90-120 degrees range to 2.86 in 0-30 degrees range during backward
   extension. Variations in the lumbopelvic ratio from 0.5 to 3 (with an
   interval of 0.25) at any trunk flexion angle generally reduced the L5-S1
   compression and shear forces by up to 21 and 45\%, respectively. The
   measured lumbopelvic ratios resulted overall in near-optimal (minimal)
   L5-S1 compression forces.
   Interpretation: A simultaneous rhythm between the lumbar and pelvis
   movements was found during both forward and backward trunk movements.
   While the lumbar spine contributed more to the trunk rotation during
   early and final stages of forward flexion and backward extension,
   respectively, the pelvis contributed more during final and early stages
   of forward flexion and backward extension, respectively. Our healthy
   subjects adapted a lumbopelvic coordination that diminished L5-S1
   compression force. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Results of a statistical analysis of transport properties measurements
   carried out on a number of concrete mixtures are presented. Migration
   and drying experiments were performed to evaluate the ionic diffusion
   coefficients and permeability of concrete mixtures. Seven concrete
   mixtures were tested. The mixtures were either batched under laboratory
   conditions or sampled from construction sites. For each mixture,
   approximately eighty concrete samples from a single batch were tested.
   Ionic diffusion coefficients were calculated by analyzing the evolution
   of the electrical current passing through concrete samples during the
   migration tests. Calculations took into account the volume of permeable
   pores of the materials and the pore solution chemistry. Permeability was
   calculated from mass loss measured during drying tests. The study
   indicates that the coefficient of variation of ionic diffusion
   coefficients is 11.1 \% on average, with a maximum of 23.5 \%, and that
   the coefficient of variation of permeability is 20.6 \% on average, with

Abstract = {{The fatigue crack growth behavior of a martensitic stainless steel CA6NM
   hydraulic turbine runner weld was investigated to unveil microstructural
   effects in the filler metal, heat affected zone and base metal.
   Knowledge of such effects is paramount for engineers who design these
   components for long fatigue lifetimes. Constant stress intensity factor
   fatigue tests in river water environment revealed crack growth rate
   variations between the three weld zones. Tensile residual stresses were
   identified as a crack opening mechanism. Crack deflection concepts were
   used to relate the fatigue crack growth resistance to the weld
   microstructure. The conclusion of this study is that the crack growth
   path is largely driven by the weld's microstructural features,
   influencing the materials resistance to fatigue crack growth. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Substantial research in software engineering focuses on understanding
   the dynamic nature of software systems in order to improve software
   maintenance and program comprehension. This research typically makes use
   of automated instrumentation and profiling techniques after the fact,
   that is, without considering domain knowledge. In this paper, we examine
   another source of dynamic information that is generated from statements
   that have been inserted into the code base during development to draw
   the system administrators' attention to important run-time phenomena. We
   call this source communicated information (CI). Examples of CI include
   execution logs and system events. The availability of CI has sparked the
   development of an ecosystem of Log Processing Apps (LPAs) that surround
   the software system under analysis to monitor and document various
   run-time constraints. The dependence of LPAs on the timeliness, accuracy
   and granularity of the CI means that it is important to understand the
   nature of CI and how it evolves over time, both qualitatively and
   quantitatively. Yet, to our knowledge, little empirical analysis has
   been performed on CI and its evolution. In a case study on two large
   open source and one industrial software systems, we explore the
   evolution of CI by mining the execution logs of these systems and the
   logging statements in the source code. Our study illustrates the need
   for better traceability between CI and the LPAs that analyze the CI. In
   particular, we find that the CI changes at a high rate across versions,
   which could lead to fragile LPAs. We found that up to 70\% of these
   changes could have been avoided and the impact of 15\% to 80\% of the
   changes can be controlled through the use of robust analysis techniques
   by LPAs. We also found that LPAs that track implementation-level CI
   (e.g. performance analysis) and the LPAs that monitor error messages
   (system health monitoring) are more fragile than LPAs that track
   domain-level CI (e.g. workload modelling), because the latter CI tends
   to be long-lived. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   change together. These approaches analyze historical data, mined from
   version control systems, and report change patterns, which lead at the
   causes, consequences, and actors of the changes to source code files.
   They also introduce so-called change patterns that describe some typical
   change dependencies among files. In this paper, we introduce two novel
   change patterns: the asynchrony change pattern, corresponding to macro
   co-changes (MC), that is, of files that co-change within a large time
   interval (change periods) and the dephase change pattern, corresponding
   to dephase macro co-changes (DC), that is, MC that always happens with
   the same shifts in time. We present our approach, that we named Macocha,
   to identify these two change patterns in large programs. We use the
   k-nearest neighbor algorithm to group changes into change periods. We
   also use the Hamming distance to detect approximate occurrences of MC
   and DC. We apply Macocha and compare its performance in terms of
   precision and recall with UMLDiff (file stability) and association rules
   (co-changing files) on seven systems: ArgoUML, FreeBSD, JFreeChart,
   Openser, SIP, XalanC, and XercesC developed with three different
   languages (C, C++, and Java). These systems have a size ranging from 532
   to 1693 files, and during the study period, they have undergone 1555 to
   23,944 change commits. We use external information and static analysis
   to validate (approximate) MC and DC found by Macocha. Through our case
   study, we show the existence and usefulness of these novel change
   patterns to ease software maintenance and, potentially, reduce related
   costs. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{We describe current approaches to thermodynamic modelling of liquids for
   the CALPHAD method, the use of available experimental methods and
   results in this type of modelling, and considerations in the use of
   atomic-scale simulation methods to inform a CALPHAD approach. We begin
   with an overview of the formalism currently used in CALPHAD to describe
   the temperature dependence of the liquid Gibbs free energy and outline
   opportunities for improvement by reviewing the current physical
   understanding of the liquid. Brief descriptions of experimental methods
   for extracting high-temperature data on liquids and the preparation of
   undercooled liquid samples are presented. Properties of a
   well-determined substance, B-2 O-3, including the glass transition, are
   then discussed in detail to emphasize specific modelling requirements
   for the liquid. We then examine the two-state model proposed for CALPHAD
   in detail and compare results with experiment and theory, where
   available. We further examine the contributions of atomic-scale methods
   to the understanding of liquids and their potential for supplementing
   available data. We discuss molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo
   methods that employ atomic interactions from classical interatomic
   potentials, as well as contributions from ab initio MD. We conclude with
   a summary of our findings. (C) 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA,

Abstract = {{The laser fragmentation technique has been extensively used to produce
   inorganic nanoparticles, but its practice on organic materials,
   especially on drugs, is less common. Here, we briefly review the recent
   advances in laser micro-/nanonization of organic materials and the
   rationale of using laser fragmentation for drug discovery. We present
   our case studies of two drug models: fenofibrate and naproxen. Both
   drugs were fragmented in water with femtosecond (fs) laser and
   characterized in terms of particle size distribution and physicochemical
   properties. Effects of fs laser fragmentation were also compared with
   nanosecond (ns) laser fragmentation and with conventional media milling
   technique. Fs laser was more suitable to produce sub-micron size drug
   particles than ns laser, but degradation of drugs after nanonization was
   also more pronounced than micronization. Physicochemical transformations
   such as oxidation, hydration and amorphisation might occur during the
   laser-material interactions. Laser nanonization showed improved
   dissolution kinetics, similar to media milling. Unlike the conventional
   milling techniques, laser fragmentation enabled the treatment of minute
   amount (as small as several milligrams) of drugs with high efficiency,
   thus is a useful tool for particle size reduction during the early
   phases of drug discovery.}},

Abstract = {{The value of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) in the maintenance of
   supply chains of aircraft parts is examined, particularly in the
   proposed analytical model. This model helps us gain a better
   understanding of the relationships between various costs incurred and
   the RFID effect on an aircraft maintenance tracking process. Using an
   RFID system, a maintenance company specializing in aircraft parts can
   accumulate savings based on the assumption that the technology can
   eliminate inaccuracy problems related to inventory recording delays
   brought about by mishandling in the component repair process. This case
   study illustrates such phenomenon through the use of numerical
   assumptions, highlighting the benefits of RFID. Further, the value of
   RFID in aircraft maintenance is evaluated using sensitivity analysis, in
   accordance with the parameters of the model of cost reductions in
   mishandling repair components and inventory control. The findings
   support the industry's acceptance of RFID technology, proving that this
   is beneficial to maintenance companies of aircraft parts. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Grippers and robotic hands are an important field in robotics. Recently,
   the combination of grasping devices and haptic feedback has been a
   promising avenue for many applications such as laparoscopic surgery and

   haptic feedback in which the apparent stiffness of the gripper as seen
   by its actuator is used to estimate contact location. This system
   combines many technologies and concepts in an integrated mechatronic
   tool. Among them, underactuated grasping, haptic feedback, compliant
   joints and a differential seesaw mechanism are used. Following a
   theoretical modeling of the gripper based on the virtual work principle,
   the authors present numerical data used to validate this model. Then, a
   presentation of the practical prototype is given, discussing the
   sensors, controllers, and mechanical architecture. Finally, the control

Abstract = {{In this paper, the development of an innovative micro-coaxial line

   frequency range available through single vector network analyzer.
   Passive devices are then demonstrated in the form of a 60 GHz band-pass
   filter and an 8 dB coupler using vertically coupled lines. Measured
   results of the demonstrative filter show an excellent agreement with
   simulated results, which present very good performances with 1.5 dB

Abstract = {{This paper presents a multifunctional control strategy for the
   autonomous operation of a multi-bus medium voltage (MV) microgrid under
   nonlinear and unbalanced load conditions. The main objective is to
   effectively compensate the harmonic currents of nonlinear loads using
   electronically-coupled distributed generation (DG) units. The proposed
   control strategy consists of a multi proportional resonant controller
   (MPRC) with adjustable resonance frequency and a harmonic impedance
   controller (HIC). The MPRC and HIC are, respectively, proposed to
   regulate the microgrid voltage and to share the harmonic currents of the
   nonlinear loads among the DG units. A conventional droop scheme is also
   employed to share the average powers of the loads between the DG units.
   Moreover, a virtual negative-sequence impedance control loop is

   negative-sequence currents of the unbalanced loads. The proposed
   strategy minimizes the flow of harmonic and negative-sequence currents
   in the MV lines of the microgrid by local compensation of harmonic and

Abstract = {{Thoracolumbar spine fracture classifications are mainly based on a
   post-traumatic observation of fracture patterns, which is not sufficient
   to provide a full understanding of spinal fracture mechanisms. This
   study aimed to biomechanically analyze known fracture patterns and to
   study how they relate to fracture mechanisms. The instigation of each
   fracture type was computationally simulated to assess the fracture
   process. A refined finite element model of three vertebrae and
   intervertebral connective tissues was subjected to 51 different dynamic
   loading conditions divided into four categories: compression, shear,
   distraction and torsion. Fracture initiation and propagation were
   analyzed, and time and energy at fracture initiation were computed. To
   each fracture pattern described in the clinical literature were
   associated one or several of the simulated fracture patterns and
   corresponding loading conditions. When compared to each other, torsion
   resulted in low-energy fractures, compression and shear resulted in
   medium energy fractures, and distraction resulted in high-energy
   fractures. Increased velocity resulted in higher-energy fracture for
   similar loadings. The use of a finite element model provided
   quantitative characterization of fracture patterns occurrence
   complementary to clinical and experimental studies, allowing to fully
   understand spinal fracture biomechanics.}},

Title = {{Effect of drainage and sequential filling on the behavior of backfill in
   mine stopes}},
Journal = {{CANADIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-15}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Underground backfilling offers significant economic and environmental
   advantages to mining operations. There is however a limited knowledge
   and understanding of how the backfill behaves within mine stopes, which
   creates some concern regarding the risk of accidents with potentially
   serious consequences. It is thus important to investigate further the
   response of backfill to ensure safe working conditions and optimize the
   filling sequence. This paper presents key results from a numerical study
   aimed at analyzing the hydrogeotechnical response of backfill in a
   narrow vertical stope. The simulations illustrate how stresses are
   influenced by stope geometry, water drainage, and filling rate. Three
   main cases are presented here to illustrate these effects; namely, (i)
   simulation of dry (or drained) backfill, (ii) a rapidly filled stope
   with progressive drainage and consolidation, and (iii) sequential
   backfill placement with different filling rates. The third case includes
   a simulation with evolving properties due to the binder added to the
   backfill. The results from the numerical analyses show that arching
   effects develop within narrow backfilled stopes because of the stiffness
   contrast between the rock and the fill material. This can produce a
   significant reduction of the stresses (horizontal and vertical) in
   comparison with the overburden pressure. The simulation results also
   show the development of excess pore-water pressures after the placement
   of the saturated backfill within the stope. Drainage tends to reduce
   these pressures and increase the frictional stresses along the rock
   walls. The sequentially filled stope simulations show that a rapid
   filling rate produces much higher total stresses and excess pore-water
   pressures, compared to slower rates. The simulation of the cemented
   backfill, with evolving properties, indicates that the progressive
   changes can have a significant effect on the total and effective
   stresses in the stope. A discussion follows on the implications of these
   results.}},

Journal = {{RESEARCH IN ENGINEERING DESIGN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{53-74}},

Abstract = {{When designing mechatronic products, `complex dependencies' are often
   reported to be a major challenge. This paper focuses on managing
   dependencies between attributes of the product during the design
   process. The literature study shows that there is a gap in the
   literature with regard to the classification of product-related
   dependencies. Traditionally, these dependencies have been described as
   appearing between the following product attributes: function, properties
   and structure. By analysing three mechatronic projects from industry, we
   identified and classified 13 types of product-related dependencies. Each
   product-related dependency is described and illustrated using the
   practical examples from the industrial projects. The value of the
   classification is evaluated by applying it to an industrial development
   setting not used for the analysis. The evaluation shows that delays in
   the project schedule, loss of functionality and quality issues can be
   avoided if attention is directed toward the product-related dependencies
   in the development process.}},

Abstract = {{A first-ever spinal cord imaging meeting was sponsored by the
   International Spinal Research Trust and the Wings for Life Foundation
   with the aim of identifying the current state-of-the-art of spinal cord

   development. This meeting was attended by a small group of invited
   experts spanning all aspects of spinal cord imaging from basic research
   to clinical practice. The greatest current challenges for spinal cord
   imaging were identified as arising from the imaging environment itself;
   difficult imaging environment created by the bone surrounding the spinal
   canal, physiological motion of the cord and adjacent tissues, and small
   cross-sectional dimensions of the spinal cord, exacerbated by metallic
   implants often present in injured patients. Challenges were also
   identified as a result of a lack of ``critical mass{''} of researchers
   taking on the development of spinal cord imaging, affecting both the
   rate of progress in the field, and the demand for equipment and software
   to manufacturers to produce the necessary tools. Here we define the
   current state-of-the-art of spinal cord imaging, discuss the underlying
   theory and challenges, and present the evidence for the current and
   potential power of these methods. In two review papers (part I and part
   II), we propose-that the challenges can be overcome with advances in
   methods, improving availability and effectiveness of methods, and
   linking existing researchers to create the necessary scientific and

   identified as a result of a lack of ``critical mass{''} of researchers
   taking on the development of spinal cord imaging, affecting both the
   rate of progress in the field, and the demand for equipment and software
   to manufacturers to produce the necessary tools. Here we define the
   current state-of-the-art of spinal cord imaging, discuss the underlying
   theory and challenges, and present the evidence for the current and
   potential power of these methods. In two review papers (part I and part
   II), we propose that the challenges can be overcome with advances in
   methods, improving availability and effectiveness of methods, and
   linking existing researdhers to create the necessary scientific and
   clinical network to advance the rate of progress and impact of the
   research. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Neural stem cells (NSCs) provide promising therapeutic potential for
   cell replacement therapy in spinal cord injury (SCI). However, high
   increases of cell viability and poor control of cell differentiation
   remain major obstacles. In this study, we have developed a non-woven
   material made of co-electrospun fibers of poly L-lactic acid and gelatin
   with a degradation rate and mechanical properties similar to peripheral
   nerve tissue and investigated their effect on cell survival and
   differentiation into motor neuronal lineages through the controlled
   release of retinoic acid (RA) and purmorphamine. Engineered Neural
   Stem-Like Cells (NSLCs) seeded on these fibers, with and without the
   instructive cues, differentiated into beta-III-tubulin, HB-9, Islet-1,
   and choactase-positive motor neurons by immunostaining, in response to
   the release of the biomolecules. In addition, the bioactive material not
   only enhanced the differentiation into motor neuronal lineages but also
   promoted neurite outgrowth. This study elucidated that a combination of
   electrospun fiber scaffolds, neural stem cells, and controlled delivery
   of instructive cues could lead to the development of a better strategy
   for peripheral nerve injury repair. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   assessing the sensitivity to frequency and component characteristics
   variations. In particular, an optical modulation component, providing an
   advantage in terms of low invasiveness, is compared with the more common
   p-i-n diode-based modulators. The validity of the proposed approach, for
   high-resolution electrically small probes is demonstrated numerically

Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this article, three linear low-density polyethylenes having different
   molecular structures were selected and films were produced from them
   using a semi-industrial cast film extrusion line. Rheological and gel
   permeation chromatography measurements were performed on the resins to
   assess their molecular structure. Mechanical, physical and sealability
   properties of the films were evaluated and the results were discussed
   with regard to the molecular structure of the resins. It was found that
   molecular weight and distribution of short-chain branching (comonomer)
   on the backbone of polyethylene chains are the main factors that control
   sealability, flexural cracking and mechanical properties. Placement of
   comonomer on medium length chains generated crystals with expanded unit
   cell that show lower melting peak. Sealing was controlled by crystal
   size distribution, chain diffusion and entanglement formation at the
   interface. linear low-density polyethylenes with lower melting point and
   boarder molecular weight distribution showed lower seal and hot tack
   initiation temperatures. Polydispersity along with molecular weight
   contributes to toughness and puncture resistance. Flexural cracking
   resistance was observed to be related to crystallinity, tie chain
   density and more importantly to the amorphous phase fraction. The
   amorphous part could absorb flexing energy and hinders crack initiation
   and propagation. Seal through contamination (caulkability) was found to
   be related to flowability and elasticity of the melt.}},

Abstract = {{User cooperation has evolved as a popular coding technique in wireless
   relay networks (WRNs). Using the neighboring nodes as relays to
   establish a communication between a source and a destination achieves an
   increase of the diversity order. The relay nodes can be seen as a
   distributed multi-antenna system, which can be exploited for transmit
   diversity by using distributed space-time block coding (STBC). In this
   paper, we investigate the bit error rate (BER) of multi-hop WRNs
   employing distributed STBC at the relay nodes. We develop the general
   model of WRNs using distributed STBC, and we derive the pairwise error
   probability and an approximation of the BER. We examine the impact of
   several parameters, such as distributed STBC at the relays, the number
   of relays, the distances between the nodes, and the channel state
   information available at the receivers, on the BER performance of the
   multi-hop WRN. The obtained results provide guidelines about the
   expected error performance and the design of channel estimation for
   these networks. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   the simulation of solids mixing using non-intrusive Lagrangian
   radioactive particle tracking data, and explains why it may provide

   polydisperse granules in a rotating drum operated in rolling mode. Given
   that the DEM is sensitive to simulation parameters, the granule
   properties were measured experimentally or extracted from the
   literature. Several flow phenomena are investigated numerically and
   experimentally, including the particle residence time, the radial
   segregation, and the radial variation of the axial dispersion
   coefficient. An analysis of the DEM model is then presented, with an
   emphasis on the Young's modulus and friction coefficients. Finally,
   dimensionless motion equations and corresponding dimensionless numbers
   are derived to investigate the effect of simulation parameters on

Abstract = {{A fully automatic framework has been introduced recently for
   neuromuscular representation of complex handwriting patterns, such as
   gestures, signatures, and words, based on the Kinematic Theory of rapid
   human movements and its Sigma-Lognormal model. In this paper, we
   investigate the application of this framework to unconstrained
   whiteboard notes, taking into account a novel acquisition modality,
   multiple writers, natural language, and complete text lines. Although
   these conditions deviate strongly from the previously considered
   scenario of brief pen movements on tablet computers, we demonstrate that
   the Sigma-Lognormal model is still able to represent the handwriting
   accurately. In order to deal with longer handwriting patterns, we
   propose a robust component-wise representation of text lines that
   achieves a high model quality. Furthermore, we propose a stroke-wise
   distortion method to generate synthetic text lines from the
   Sigma-Lognormal representation of real specimens. For handwriting
   recognition on the JAM online database, it is demonstrated that the
   extension of the training set with the proposed synthesis method
   significantly increases current benchmark results achieved with
   recurrent neural networks.}},

Abstract = {{The use of Higher-Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) and other
   tensor decomposition methods are popular in the face recognition domain,
   yet a direct application to handwritten character recognition has not
   shown promising results so far. Character recognition is commonly
   performed in two steps: feature extraction and classification. In this
   paper, we propose a feature extraction algorithm based on HOSVD which is
   then combined with standard statistical classification. The algorithm
   constructs a tensor from the training data and applies HOSVD in order to
   obtain a feature extractor matrix for arbitrary character images. We
   evaluate the proposed handwriting features in combination with SVM
   classification for character recognition on the CEDAR benchmark data
   set. The results indicate that our proposed approach significantly
   outperforms the standard HOSVD classification method.}},

Abstract = {{A method for automatic generation of synthetic handwritten words is
   presented which is based in the Kinematic Theory and its Sigma-lognormal
   model. To generate a new synthetic sample, first a real word is modelled
   using the Sigma log-normal model. Then the Sigma-lognormal parameters
   are randomly perturbed within a range, introducing human-like variations
   in the sample. Finally, the velocity function is recalculated taking
   into account the new parameters. The synthetic words are then used as
   training data for a Hidden Markov Model based on-line handwritten
   recognizer. The experimental results confirm the great potential of the
   Kinematic Theory of rapid human movements applied to writer adaptation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, methods for the design space exploration of
   interconnection repeaters in deep-sub-micron power-managed VLSI are

   the device threshold-voltage, as the design parameters; and guarantee
   that the designed interconnections are energy-optimal while they meet
   their performance objectives in all the system operating states. These
   methods take the output resistance of the repeaters into account, when
   the system supply-voltage, system operating frequency as well as the
   device threshold-voltage requirements change. Utilizing the proposed
   techniques, a multi-cycle 10-mm long bus is designed for some design
   objectives. HSPICE simulations confirm that the designed bus is
   energy-optimal, and that it meets its performance targets in all the

Abstract = {{Avionic networks exerting the Avionics Full-Duplex Switched Ethernet
   (AFDX) protocol utilize a small amount of the bandwidth to transmit
   critical traffics. As there is an increasing demand on data exchange for
   non critical applications, it is of great interest to make use of the
   physically available capability of the network through optimal bandwidth
   allocation. In this paper, the problem of bandwidth allocation in AFDX
   networks is treated in the framework of Network Utility Maximization
   (NUM). In the present work, multi-path routing is used for non-critical
   applications to explore the available bandwidth and to improve system
   performance. The optimization problem is decomposed into a rate update
   subproblem and a traffic routing subproblem linked together by a pricing
   dynamic system. A distributed algorithm for bandwidth allocation with
   multi-path routing is developed and the convergence of the algorithm is
   proven using Lyapunov stability theory. Some issues related to the
   implementation of the devolved algorithm in the context of real AFDX
   networks are addressed and the corresponding solutions are provided.
   Finally, TrueTime based simulations conform the viability and the
   applicability of the proposed approach.}},
