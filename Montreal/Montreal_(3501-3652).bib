Abstract = {{In this paper, the application of a comprehensive augmented nodal matrix
   formulation to the multiphase fault analysis of unbalanced distribution
   systems is demonstrated. The solution technique results in a sparse
   matrix which can be rapidly solved by employing sparse LU factorization
   algorithms. The augmented matrix fully respects the actual circuit
   components of distribution systems and eliminates the necessity of pre-
   and post-processing in the implementation of the algorithm. For example,
   protective devices that exist in the network are not eliminated but they
   are represented with benign switches in the matrix. Network devices
   including transmission lines, cables and transformers can all be modeled
   in phase domain with their respective physical quantities. The fault
   conditions including short circuit and open conductor faults are
   represented with switches by adding the switch equations to the bottom
   of the augmented matrix which has a dynamic allocation structure.
   Although the presented solution is of general nature and can encompass
   networks from transmission level to meshed secondary distribution grids,
   the examples are rather concentrated on distribution systems where
   multiphase analysis is more common and desirable due to unbalanced
   network components.}},

Abstract = {{Voltage Source Converter (VSC) HVDC technologies present a bright
   opportunity in a variety of fields within the power system industry due
   to their recognized advantages in comparison to conventional
   line-commutated HVDC systems. Computational burden introduced by
   detailed modeling of VSC-HVDC systems in EMT-type programs complicates
   the study of transient events. Detailed modeling includes the
   representation of semiconductor switches and causes significant
   deterioration in computational speed. This paper presents the concept of
   average-value modeling applied to two-and three-level VSC-HVDC systems.
   The modeling approach is validated for a multi-terminal VSC-based HVDC
   system used to integrate off-shore wind generation. Dynamic performance
   simulation results using average-value models are compared against
   detailed model results. Some results are also presented for MMC
   converters.}},

Title = {{Authentic OM problem solving in an ERP context}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - It is argued that problem-based learning (PBL) is a valuable
   approach to teaching operations management, as it allows learners to
   apply their knowledge and skills in an environment that is close to
   real-life. In fact, many simulations currently exist in the teaching of
   operations management. However, these simulations lack a connection to
   real-life, as they are typically turn-based and do not use real-life IT
   support. The current paper seeks to address this issue by presenting an
   innovative pedagogical approach designed to provide learners with an
   authentic problem-solving experience in operations management within an
   enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper proposes a simulation game
   called ERPsim whereby students must operate an enterprise in a simulated
   economic environment using in real time a real-life ERP system, namely
   SAP. Based on a survey with instructors, it assesses the extent to which
   this proposed simulation is aligned with the five characteristics of the
   PBL approach.
   Findings - Survey respondents confirm that significant improvements in
   student evaluations, learner motivation, attendance, and engagement, as
   well as increased learner competence with the technology can be achieved
   by using the proposed approach.
   Practical implications - For more than five years this pedagogical
   approach has been used by more than 250 professors, lecturers, and
   professional trainers in over 160 universities worldwide. Between
   September 2009 and June 2011, more than 3,000 simulations games were
   played by over 16,000 university student teams.
   Originality/value - Results and observations on using the proposed
   pedagogical approach are presented and compared to the main
   characteristics of the PBL approach (authenticity, ill structured
   problems, student-centered, small group settings and facilitator
   dimensions).}},

Abstract = {{In the case of variable speed axial compressors, it is a matter of great
   importance to investigate the impact of speed variations on surge and
   stall transients. In spite of the important research on this subject,
   the qualitative behavior of variable speed axial compressors and the
   development of an effective controller are still challenging problems.
   The present paper studies the impact of speed transitions on the
   stability of high efficiency operating points being near to the fully
   developed rotating stall zone. Effects of throttle gain and acceleration
   rate as the bifurcation parameters of the model are also addressed to
   demonstrate the richness of nonlinear dynamics. Another key parameter,
   which affects the qualitative behavior of the system, is gas viscosity.
   The impact of gas viscosity is investigated as well.
   Time-domain simulation and bifurcation analysis as two standard and
   complementary methods for describing the qualitative behavior of systems
   are employed here. Outcomes reveal that speed transitions causing
   temporary stall harmonics, can drive the system to undesirable fully
   developed stall zone. This phenomenon threatens the stability of high
   efficiency operating points during speed transitions. Therefore, a need
   arises to develop an effective control approach being capable of
   simultaneously suppressing stall and achieving rapid acceleration.}},

Abstract = {{Reaction systems can be represented by first-principles models that
   describe the evolution of the states (typically concentrations, volume
   and temperature) by means of conservation equations of differential
   nature and constitutive equations of algebraic nature. The resulting
   models often contain redundant states since the various concentrations
   are not all linearly independent; indeed, the variability observed in
   the concentrations is caused by the reactions, the mass transferred
   between phases, the inlet and outlet streams. A minimal state
   representation is a dynamic model that exhibits the same behavior as the
   original model but has no redundant state. This paper considers the
   material balance equations associated with an open fluid-fluid reaction
   system that involves S-l species, R independent reactions, p(l)
   independent inlets and one outlet in the first fluid phase (e. g. the
   liquid phase) and S-g species, p(g) independent inlets and one outlet in
   the second fluid phase (e. g. the gas phase). In addition, there are
   p(m) species transferring between the two phases. The (S-l +
   S-g)-dimensional model is transformed to q = R + 2p(m) + p(l) + p(g) + 2
   variant states and S-l + S-g - q invariant states. Then, using the
   concept of accessibility of nonlinear systems, the conditions under
   which the transformed model is a minimal state representation are
   derived. It will be shown that the minimal number of concentration
   measurements needed to reconstruct the full state without kinetic
   information is R + p(m). The simulated chlorination of butanoic acid is
   used to illustrate the various concepts developed in the paper.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the corrosion properties of AISI 301 stainless steel (SS)
   coated with 1-micron thick titanium nitride (TiN) hard coatings is
   investigated. TiN was deposited by pulsed magnetron sputtering resulting
   in different microstructure ranging from agglomerated crystallites to
   homogeneous film. Microstructure of the coatings was characterized by
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), and energy
   dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Resistance to general and localized
   corrosion was evaluated by potentiodynamic polarization in NaCl 1\%
   solution. It has been shown that the existence of columnar structure in
   the TiN film reduces significantly the resistance to localized corrosion
   due to infiltration of liquid through paths at the grain boundaries.
   Furthermore, by comparing the polarization curves of TiN coatings
   deposited on SS and glass, it was shown that the electrochemical
   response of TiN-coated SS at low potentials is the result of
   electrochemical activity at the coating/electrolyte interface whereas at
   high potentials the increase in the current is the result of pits
   generated at the substrate/electrolyte interface at defects/pores within
   the coating.}},

Abstract = {{This study introduces a micromechanical model that incorporates detailed
   microstructures for analyzing the effective electro-mechanical
   properties, such as piezoelectric and permittivity constants as well as
   elastic moduli, of piezoelectric particle reinforced composites. The
   studied composites consist of polarized spherical piezoelectric
   particles dispersed into a continuous and elastic polymeric matrix. A
   micromechanical model generated using three-dimensional (3D) continuum
   elements within a finite element (FE) framework. For each volume
   fraction (VF) of particles, realization with different particle sizes
   and arrangements were generated in order to represent microstructures of
   a particle composite. We examined the effects of microstructural
   morphologies, such as particle sizes and distributions, and particle
   volume fractions on the overall effective electro-mechanical properties
   of the active composites. The overall electro-mechanical properties
   determined from the present micromechanical model were compared to those
   generated using the Mori-Tanaka, selfconsistent, and simplified

Series = {{Woodhead Publishing in Materials}},
Year = {{2012}},
Pages = {{394-411}},
Abstract = {{The strength and the physical properties of composite materials are no
   doubt improved by the presence of the reinforcing particles. However,
   the higher energy requirement, the rapid tool wear and the associated
   poor surface finish during machining of metal matrix composites (MMCs)
   are leading drawbacks of the presence of the reinforcement particles. As
   a result, the applications of MMCs are still limited in certain areas.
   Understanding the deformation behavior and the effects of the
   reinforcement on the chip formation and the machinability is therefore
   crucial for proper tool selection, machining cost minimization and the
   expansion of MMCs to higher-volume applications.
   Several factors of the particulate, such as nature, shape, size, volume
   fraction and distribution, are responsible for the mechanical behavior
   of MMCs, and thereby the cutting forces and the tool wear mechanisms.
   Some of these process indicators are still difficult to predict not only
   because of the nature, size and distribution of the reinforcements but
   also due to role that these reinforcements play during chip formation
   and the way in which the particles are removed or cut. This chapter
   presents the effects of reinforcement on chip formation, tool wear and
   part quality during the machining of MMCs.}},

Abstract = {{Acid mine drainage (AMD) remains one of the major environmental problems
   for the mining industry. When AMD is produced on a mine site, passive
   treatment techniques such as limestone drains (LDs) can be used to
   improve water quality, particularly when the effluent is relatively
   small. In 1999, LDs were installed in combination with a cover with
   capillary barrier effects to rehabilitate the abandoned acid-generating
   Lorraine mine site in Quebec, Canada. However, the quality of the water
   exiting the LD does not meet the local regulations (even if a
   significant improvement has been observed). To better understand the
   behaviour of the drains, the hydraulic residence time (HRT) was
   evaluated using various tracer tests. Tests' results indicate that the
   HRT in the Lorraine LDs is close to the minimum value targeted at the
   design stage but is significantly different than those estimated from
   the geometrical characteristics and porosity of the drains and the water
   flow discharge.}},

   acceptability questionnaires, field notes and observations. Most
   participants found the application easy to use. They learned tips for
   taking their medication, diminishing adverse side-effects and
   maintaining a positive attitude towards treatment. Many participants
   deemed their experience with the application highly satisfactory and

Abstract = {{Liquid- suction or internal heat exchanger (LHX) is installed in vapor
   compression refrigeration systems to exchange energy between cool
   low-pressure gas and warm high-pressure liquid refrigerant. The aim of
   this research is to experimentally evaluate the effect of IHX adaptation
   in an automotive air conditioning system focusing on evaporator working
   conditions. In this new design of IHX, the high-pressure liquid passes
   through the central channel and the low-pressure vapor flows in several
   parallel channels in the opposite direction. The experimental set-up has
   been made up of original components of the air conditioning system of a
   medium sedan car, specially designed and built to analyze vehicle A/C
   equipments under real work conditions. The results show that low
   pressure drop will be imposed on the cycle using this type of IHX. Also,
   they confirm considerable decrease of compressor power consumption; it
   is intensified at higher evaporator air flow. A significant improvement
   of the coefficient of performance will be achieved with IHX too. The
   influence of operating conditions has been also discussed in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{The evaluation of an oxygen barrier cover performance is an integral
   part of many reclamation programs that aim at limiting acid mine
   drainage (AMD) production from sulphide tailings. The oxygen flux
   through the cover to the underlying reactive tailings should then be
   much smaller (by a factor of 1000 or more) than the flux into exposed
   (uncovered) tailings. Different techniques have been developed over the
   years to assess this flux. Given the limitations encountered when using
   available approaches to measure such low oxygen flux, the authors have
   developed a modified testing and interpretation method based on the
   oxygen consumption (OC) test, which is commonly used to determine
   oxidation rates of uncovered tailings. The proposed modifications to the
   OC testing procedure are presented in this paper, together with the new
   interpretation method. Typical tests results obtained with the modified
   OC method on an existing site, reclaimed using a layered cover with
   capillary barrier effects (CCBE), are presented and discussed. The
   results demonstrate that the modified oxygen consumption (MOC) test is
   an effective tool to assess the performance of oxygen barrier covers
   used to prevent AMD.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to present a heuristic algorithm for
   quality control planning from an insurance perspective. The approach
   proposed here is designed to judiciously allocate controls in two
   stages: one to manage risk exposure, in terms of potential product loss,
   and the second to improve the effectiveness of the controls themselves.
   The method employed to evaluate this algorithm is based on three
   comparisons. One of these is presented in the first part of the paper
   and the other two in the second part. The test provided in this first
   part of the paper is performed on a simplified case study and compares
   the proposed heuristic algorithm (HA) to an optimised allocation (OA)
   method. The main objective of this paper is to present, in detail, a
   quality control planning method which allocates measurement resources
   with the aim of remaining below a threshold limit of risk exposure and
   of improving the effectiveness of the controls. The evaluation presented
   in the second part of the paper underscores the potential, as well as
   the limitations, of the proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this article is to test the performance of a heuristic
   algorithm that computes a quality control plan. The objective of the
   tests reported in this paper is twofold: (1) to compare the proposed
   heuristic algorithm (HA) to an optimal allocation (OA) method; and (2)
   to analyse the behaviour and limitations of the proposed HA on a scale-1
   test with a before/after test. The method employed to evaluate this
   algorithm is based on comparisons:
   (1) The first test illustrates the method and its sensitivity to
   internal parameters. It is based on a simplified case study of a product
   from the semiconductor industry. The product is made up of 1000, 800 and
   1200 wafers incorporating three different technologies. The production
   duration is 1 week, and three tools were involved in this test. The
   behaviour of the proposed algorithm is checked throughout the evolution
   of the model parameters: risk exposure limit (R-L) and measurement
   capacity (P). The quality control plan for each tool and product are
   analysed and compared to those from a one stage allocation process
   (named C-0) that does not take into account risk exposure
   considerations. A comparison is also performed with OA.
   (2) The second scale-1 test is based on three scenarios of several
   months of regular semiconductor production. Data were obtained from 23
   etching and 12 photolithographical tools. The outputs provided by the HA
   are used in the sampling scheduler implemented at this plant. The
   resulting samples are compared against three indicators.
   The results of these comparisons show that, for small instances, OA is
   more relevant than the HA method. The HA provides realistic limits that
   are suitable for daily operations. Even though the HA may provide far
   from optimal results, it demonstrates major MAR improvement. In terms of
   the maximum inhibit limit, the HA achieves better performances than C-0,
   and they are strongly correlated to R-L and to the control capacity. The
   article concludes that the proposed algorithm can be used to plan
   controls and to guide their scheduling. It can also improve the
   insurance design for several levels of acceptance of risk.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper presents an analysis of the influence of loading
   history on unstable fracture of austenitic steel 304 (SS 304) using the
   J-integral and its applicability in situations where a loading history
   exists. A CT specimen is employed for the purpose. The loading history
   effect on the unstable fracture of SS 304 is studied by performing
   cyclic loading with different load histories at constant load range
   (Delta P-i) and at constant stress intensity factor range (Delta K-j).
   The results show that the plastic singularity is well described by the
   integral (J) for the different types of loadings used. Moreover, the
   real meaning of (J(IC)) as a representative of the maximum energy
   release rate is quite limited if it ignores the loading history. The
   experimental results show that the dissipated energy Delta J is more
   active when the loading is done at constant Delta P. The evolution of
   Delta J can be directly linked to the crack growth rate and to the
   extent of the plastic zone developed at the crack tip.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores design methods applicable to Wireless Sensors
   Networks, where low power consumption and energy efficiency are a must.
   A key component that modulates the power consumption is the main radio.
   Controlling its use through suitable sleep modes and wake up mechanisms
   is a significant issue and can be done with a wake-up receiver. But many
   applications are associated with low fabrication volume where custom
   integrated circuits are not economical and where FPGAs are the best
   available solution. In this paper, we explore an asynchronous solution,
   which permits to decrease the internal activity, thus reducing the power
   consumption, including that required for clock distribution. We also
   propose an FPGA implementation of such a wake-up receiver using the NULL
   Convention Logic T. The overall power consumption of the reported
   implementation is as low as 5 mu W at 250 kbps.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a new non invasive diagnosing device, the
   spectroscopy reflectance camera. This device combines the
   spectro-reflectrometry with a CMOS image sensor to evaluate the oxygen
   saturation in living organs. This combination is realized by merging an
   image sensor to an optical fibre linked to a spectrograph. While the
   image sensor helps targeting precisely the blood vessel to be evaluated,
   the spectrograph gathers the reflected light spectrum from the vessel.
   The optical fibre is 50 microns diameter and has one end inserted in the
   back side of the image sensor. This end reaches the first silicon oxide
   layer on the component side, which is transparent. The other end is
   connected to the spectrograph; it transmits the intensity of the
   reflected light. In order to insert the optical fibre in the image
   sensor, we propose a process to achieve a highly directional etching
   technique with high aspect ratio. Also, we present a new image sensor
   structure allowing the presence of a hole in the center of the pixel
   array. The presence of the hole adds some design constraints leading to
   divide a conventional pixel array into four independent sub-arrays,
   where every pixel is addressed and read out separately.}},

   system was used to tune the cavity length of an optical resonator based
   on an asymmetric Fabry-Perot (FP) cavity. The monitoring of the
   translated in-plane motion was done by tracking the spectral position of
   the FP resonance. We report the translation of a 1.70 mu m vertical

Abstract = {{Software systems evolve continuously, requiring continuous maintenance
   and development. Consequently, their architecture tends to degrade with
   time as it becomes less relevant to new, emerging requirements.
   Therefore, stability or resilience is a primary criterion for evaluating
   an architecture. In this paper, we propose a quantitative approach to
   study the evolution of the architecture of object oriented systems over
   time. In particular, we represent an architecture as a set of triplets
   (S, R, T), where S and T represent two classes and R is a relationship
   linking them. We use these triplets as basic unit to measure the
   stability of an architecture. We show the applicability and usefulness
   of our approach by studying the evolution of three open source systems:
   JFreeChart and Xerces-J and Rhino.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic Resonance Navigation (MRN) relies on Magnetic Nanoparticles
   (MNPs) embedded in microcarriers or microrobots to allow the induction
   of a directional propelling force by 3-D magnetic gradients. These
   magnetic gradients are superposed on a sufficiently high homogeneous
   magnetic field (e. g. the Bo field of a MR scanner) to achieve maximum
   propelling force through magnetization saturation of the MNPs. As
   previously demonstrated by our group, such technique was successful at
   maintaining microcarriers along a planned trajectory in the blood
   vessels based on tracking information gathered using Magnetic Resonance
   Imaging (MRI) sequences from artifacts caused by the same MNPs. Besides
   propulsion and tracking, the same MNPs can be synthesized with
   characteristics that can allow for the diffusion of therapeutic cargo
   carried by these MR-navigable carriers through the Blood Brain Barrier
   (BBB) using localized hyperthermia without compromising the MRN
   capabilities. In the present study, localized hyperthermia induced by an
   alternating magnetic field (AC field) is investigated for the purpose of
   transient controlled disruption of the BBB and hence local delivery of
   therapeutic agents into the brain. Here, an external heating apparatus
   was used to impose a regional heat shock on the skull of a living mouse
   model. The effect of heat on the permeability of the BBB was assessed
   using histological observation and tissue staining by Evans blue dye.
   Results show direct correlation between hyperthermia and BBB leakage as
   well as its recovery from thermal damage. Therefore, in addition to
   on-command propulsion and remote tracking, the proposed navigable agents
   could be suitable for controlled opening of the BBB by hyperthermia and
   selective brain drug delivery.}},

Abstract = {{Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation is an industrial practice that
   consists in testing a physical electronic control unit (ECU) against a
   real-time simulated model of a plant. Typical PWM applications run in
   the kHz range and can hardly be simulated using standard methods with
   the typical CPU time-steps that are at best in the 5-10 microseconds
   range. Migrating the computational load from a CPU to a Field
   Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) allows overcoming the limitation and
   achieving time-steps in the sub-microsecond range. Our work investigates
   the feasibility of hardware calculation engines intended for the
   FPGA-based HIL simulation using commercial floating-point cores, and
   using parallel multi-cycle multiply-accumulators (MACs). The
   effectiveness of the proposed multicycle accumulation scheme is here
   confirmed by considering a real-world application case study, that is a
   model of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) driven by a
   three-phase two-level Insulated-Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) inverter.
   Time-steps of 80 ns for the PMSM and 240 ns for the two-level inverter
   are reported. Simulation results are validated using the SimPowerSystems
   Matlab library with a 20 kHz PWM.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of this article is to establish a set of test cases
   for analytical verification and inter-model comparison of vertical
   ground heat exchanger (GHX) models used in building simulation programs.
   Several test cases are suggested. They range from steady-state heat
   rejection in a single borehole to varying hourly loads with relatively
   large yearly thermal imbalance in multiple borehole configurations. The
   usefulness of the proposed test cases is illustrated with different GHX
   models. This comparison exercise has shown that analytical
   one-dimensional (1D) models compare favourably well with
   three-dimensional (3D) models for relatively short-simulation periods,
   where axial effects are not significant. Cyclic heat
   rejection/collection tests proved to be useful to characterize the
   accuracy and the computational performance of different load aggregation
   algorithms. Finally, different spatial superposition methods have been
   compared for various bore field sizes and configurations and various
   loads.}},

   possesses distinctive advantages which proved to be of use in PAHM. This
   approach has been introduced by a group of researchers at Rutgers
   University in the USA, in the medical field, and it was adapted and used
   in the field of PAHM for the first time by our group of researchers.
   Unlike the traditional approaches that are either based on mathematical
   and statistical models or neural network modelling, this approach is
   based only on the advancement in the field of computer science, namely
   the speed of computation and the volume of data that can be processed,
   and proceeds in a logical manner like the human brain. That is why its
   potential for future applications seems promising. LAD does not assume
   that the data belong to a specific statistical distribution and
   therefore does not require statistical analysis of data prior to or
   after its use. Unlike the statistically based techniques, correlations
   and dependence between features or variables do not have any effect on
   LAD's performance. LAD can handle this phenomenon, and moreover, it
   gives physical explanation to it. Unlike other data analysis techniques,
   such as neural networks and support vector machines, LAD is a
   transparent method; the output of LAD can be traced back to the specific
   root causes that resulted in the categorization of a specific
   observation into a certain class. The interpretability of all the
   results and of all the steps of calculation is a clear advantage that
   maintenance experts can use in order to find answers to their questions.
   LAD detects and diagnoses complex phenomena such as equipment fault due
   to the interaction of multiple factors. Moreover, LAD is not based and
   does not need data on failure events. Thus, for physical assets that
   have a lifetime of 25 or 30 years, degradation can still be analyzed and
   maintenance decision can still be taken.
   During the learning process, LAD analyzes the collected data that
   represents readings of some physical asset's features such as vibration
   signals, oil analysis, temperature, etc..., which are taken while the
   asset is in different states, for example new, failing, deteriorating,,
   etc. It then generates patterns that can be easily interpreted and
   translated into meaningful physical rules. LAD automatically extracts
   features and generates patterns from the readings and, accordingly,
   classifies the asset into a certain state based on the patterns
   generated. The learning function of cbmLAD results in an accumulation
   and preservation of expert knowledge that can be used at any time by the
   user, even if the human expertise is lost due to retirement or
   resignation. It thus becomes a powerful knowledge management tool that
   automates and conserves knowledge.
   In the testing process LAD can detect and diagnose the asset's state
   based on the generated knowledge during the learning process. This
   process of learning and pattern generation serve to reinforce the
   theoretical knowledge and uncover new knowledge about a certain
   diagnostic problem in PAHM. LAD has been applied successful in different
   situations that will be presented in the following sections.}},

   Design/methodology/approach - This paper is a literature review
   (scientific and governmental) of the most important articles in the
   field of state of preparedness evaluation.
   Findings - This article presents two trends in the state of preparedness
   evaluation: response capability and preparation management. These two
   trends contribute to the evolution of the concept ``state of
   preparedness{''} into ``state of resilience{''}, a state that is defined
   as the ability of a system to maintain or restore an acceptable level of

Title = {{Transient Redox Activity of Vanadyl Pyrophosphate at Ambient and
   Elevated Pressure}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL REACTOR ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{10}},
Abstract = {{The transient catalytic activity of vanadyl pyrophosphate (VPP) catalyst
   was studied at ambient and elevated pressure (4.1 bar) and a wide range
   of operating conditions. The range included the commercial operating
   conditions typical of fixed bed, fluidized bed and circulating fluidized
   beds (CFB) for the partial oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride
   (MA). The maleic anhydride yield improved by increasing the feed oxygen
   molar fraction, temperature and pressure. When the catalyst was cycled
   between an oxidizing (synthetic air) and a reducing environment; yield
   increased with an increase in the catalyst residence time in the
   oxidizing environment. This effect was more pronounced at higher
   pressure. At ambient pressure, MA selectivity varied between 50-73 \%
   while it decreased to about 48-54 \% at a pressure of 4.1 bar. A strong
   MA selectivity dependency on feed composition was observed when the
   oxidation time was in the range of actual industrial reactors (< 1
   minute). Selectivity data suggested that different oxygen species might
   be responsible for CO formation compared to other products such as CO2
   and MA.
   Under oxidizing feed conditions (oxygen/n-butane equal or larger than
   3.7), an increase in n butane conversion was the main contributor to
   improved MA yield: n-butane conversion increased by about 70 \% when the
   catalyst oxidation time extended from 0.3 to 10 minute. While, under
   fuel rich feed conditions, typical of industrial CFB operations, both MA
   selectivity and n-butane conversion contributed to enhancement in MA
   yield. Depending on the feed composition, MA selectivity increases by
   about 16-30 \% and n butane conversion increases by about 32-55 \% by
   extending the catalyst oxidation time. These results show the critical
   importance of catalyst oxidation time on reaction yield improvement
   especially when operating under fuel rich feed conditions. The surface
   adsorbed or surface lattice oxygen species were suggested to be the main
   responsible for n butane activation. While, the contribution of
   catalyst's sub-surface lattice oxygen was believed to be very limited at
   fuel rich feed conditions. Under these conditions, catalyst
   over-reduction cannot be effectively compensated even after excessive
   catalyst regeneration and presence of gas phase oxygen is critical to
   maintain a high catalytic activity.
   As the reactor pressure increased to 4.1 bar, up to 60 \% increase in n
   butane conversion accompanied by 100 \% increase in oxygen conversion
   was observed. MA selectivity decreased by about 20 \% on average but the
   increase in n-butane conversion resulted in an overall yield improvement
   of up to 30 \%. Data show that the catalytic performance could be
   enhanced at certain combination of reactor pressure and temperature.}},

Title = {{Mutual adjustment search with incentive for supply chain planning
   coordination}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{25}},

Pages = {{946-962}},
Abstract = {{Supply chains are complex systems, which include several independent
   organisations with different objectives. A key issue in supply chain
   management is the coordination of supply chain planning decisions.
   Supply chain planning systems introduced in the literature can be
   classified into two main planning systems: centralised and decentralised
   planning systems. Centralised systems can theoretically optimise supply
   chain performance, although its implementation requires a high degree of
   information exchange among supply chain partners. This leads to
   difficulties when independent partners do not want to share information.
   In order to address these difficulties, decentralised systems are
   designed for supply chains where each member is a separate economic
   entity that makes its operational decisions independently, yet with some
   minimal level of information sharing. In this paper, we propose a
   decentralised coordination mechanism based on a negotiation-like mutual
   adjustment of planning decisions, rooted in mathematical programming.
   This mechanism, unlike traditional centralised system, involves two
   enterprises, which interact with each other in order to improve their
   individual and collective performance. Computational analysis shows that
   the proposed negotiation-like coordination mechanism leads to
   near-optimal results when compared to central coordination, while
   maintaining fairness in terms of revenue sharing.}},

   analysis}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING}},

Volume = {{25}},

Pages = {{963-980}},
Abstract = {{Agent-based systems have been employed in the Supply Chain Management
   field since the 1990s. In spite of its appealing and extensive use in
   both research and practice, the agent technology and its integration
   with advanced supply chain planning and scheduling tools still represent
   an emergent field with many open research questions. Particularly, the
   literature fails to provide an integrated framework to identify, model
   and conduct simulation experiments covering the whole simulation cycle.
   Indeed, the initial modelling effort performed at the analysis phase is
   especially neglected by the literature concerned. This early phase is
   critical because it considerably influences the whole development
   process as well as the resulting simulation experiments. Thus, this
   article presents a novel methodological framework called FAMASS (FORAC
   Architecture for Modelling Agent-based Simulation for Supply chain
   planning), which provides: (i) a uniform representation of distributed
   advanced supply chain planning and scheduling systems using agent
   technology; and (ii) a methodological approach supporting analysts in
   defining functional requirements of possible simulation experiments. The
   proposed methodological framework was tested through a real-scale
   proof-of-concept case employing data from two industrial partners.}},

Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Pages = {{251-257}},
Abstract = {{The latest myoelectric prostheses have several degrees of freedom and
   therefore require a large number of myoelectric signals to fully exploit
   their capabilities. Muscle compartments, which are intra-muscular
   subdivisions innervated by an individual muscle nerve branch, can be
   exploited to provide additional independent muscle control sites to
   operate such prostheses. To explore whether muscle compartments can be
   voluntarily controlled, electromyographic (EMG) signals are recorded
   from an array of seven pairs of equally spaced surface electrodes
   positioned across the biceps brachii of four healthy subjects. The EMG
   signals are collected in two positions: 1) with the subject seated,
   right elbow flexed similar to 100 degrees, and 2) with the subject
   standing with the right arm extended horizontally in the coronal plane
   (out to the side). In both positions, the hand is either fully
   supinated, neutral, or fully pronated. The average root mean square
   value of the EMG signals obtained from three pairs of electrodes
   positioned over the biceps short head are compared with the average
   obtained for the three pairs placed over the biceps long head. Out of
   the nine hand position/load pairs examined, two pairs are found to
   elicit larger EMG activity in the long head or in the short head. The
   potential to preferentially activate either the short or the long head
   of the biceps suggests that the selective activation of muscle
   compartments is a promising strategy for facilitating the control of
   myoelectric prostheses capable of generating many types of movement.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The Therapeutic Return to Work (TRW) is a comprehensive
   rehabilitation process that is centralised in the workplace and consists
   of a worker's progressive return to his or her regular work. A programme
   impact theory for the TRW and three mechanism hypotheses were developed
   (Durand et al., 2003). The objective of this study was to validate the
   mechanism hypotheses.
   Participants: Construction workers who received compensation for low
   back pain.
   Methods: A multiple-case study was carried out. Data on the programme
   activities were collected on a repeated basis using validated
   measurement instruments and semi-structured interviews of the 20
   participants and the clinicians responsible for them. Analyses were
   carried out using the pattern matching technique.
   Results: The results supported two of the three hypotheses proposed in
   the impact theory, specifically, that the development of competent work
   behaviours is a key factor in promoting return to work and appears to be
   associated with a reduction in work environment constraints, an
   improvement in work capacities and the presence of concerted action.
   Conclusion: This study revealed that rehabilitation interventions
   carried out in the workplace and involving workers with low back pain
   are both complex and embedded in the social environment, and that the
   actions taken must be coordinated in collaboration with various
   stakeholders.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a broadband and simple vertical transition between
   substrate integrated waveguide and standard air-filled rectangular
   waveguide is design and experimentally verified. From full-wave
   simulation of the structure, a relative bandwidth of 19.5\% in W-band
   with return loss better than 20dB is reached. Then, five copies of
   back-to-back connected transitions are fabricated on RT/Duroid 5880
   substrate. The experimental results show that the transition pairs have
   an average of 15\% relative bandwidth with return loss better than 12dB
   and insert loss lower than 1.2dB. To explain the differences between
   simulated and tested results, an error analysis is presented.}},

Abstract = {{An industrial research project was launched in 2007 at Ecole
   Polytechnique de Montreal to develop a new generation of precast bridge
   parapets using nonlinear finite element calculations. The paper presents
   the design of a hybrid precast parapet made with ultra-high performance
   fiber reinforced concretes (UHPFRC) and its experimental validation. The
   hybrid parapet consisted of a thin shell of UHPFRC paired with a normal
   strength concrete core. The outstanding properties of the UHPFRC
   permitted the removal of all conventional reinforcement while keeping
   the cast-on-site parapet thickness. A new anchorage system was optimized
   for parapet installation on a new bridge deck. Quasi-static tests, and
   dynamic tests replicating 4 levels of vehicle impacts, were conducted on
   full-scale parapets. Test results showed that the load-carry capacity of
   the hybrid UHPFRC parapet exceed the PL-2 or TL-4 parapet specifications
   of CSA and AASHTO. Moreover it offers a strength level equivalent to
   standard cast-on-site constructions.}},

Abstract = {{So far ergonomics has been concerned with two categories of activities:
   correction and design. We propose to add a third category: prospection,
   and by so doing, we introduce a new series of activities that opens up
   the future of ergonomics. Corrective ergonomics relates to the past and
   comes with a demand and a client. It is turned towards the correction of
   existing situations and aims to reduce or eliminate problems. Here,
   after delimiting and defining the problem, the challenge is to find the
   best solution. Ergonomics for design relates to the present and also
   comes with a demand and a client. It is turned towards the design of new
   artefacts that have already been identified by a client, and that will
   allow users to do some activity and attain their goals. Here, after
   defining the scope of the project and the functional requirements, the
   challenge is to do the best design. Finally, prospective ergonomics
   relates to the future and does not come with a demand and a client. It
   is turned towards the creation of future things that have not been
   identified yet. Here the challenge is to detect existing user needs or
   anticipate future ones, and imagine solutions. These three categories of
   activities overlap and are not exclusive of each other. In this paper we
   define prospective ergonomics and compare it with corrective ergonomics
   and ergonomics for design. We describe its origin, goal, and prospects,
   we analyze its impacts on education and practice, and we emphasize the
   need of new collaboration between ergonomics and other disciplines.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explains how a product's usefulness may be defined and
   measured. Many aspects of consumer product assessments are conducted
   sub-consciously and this process is closely examined. A product's
   usefulness can be evaluated by measuring its advantages over alternative
   solutions based on specific criteria associated with fundamentals needs.
   When multiple criteria are involved, different weights are assigned to
   each. It should take into account the context in which the product is
   used. For the purpose of this paper, we use a formula to determine the
   relative usefulness of a variety of products in different contexts. We
   conclude that aspects of product's usefulness, connected with
   sub-conscious human decision making processes, can be a major factor in
   predicting acceptance and rejection rates.}},

Abstract = {{A tracing and monitoring framework produces detailed execution trace
   files for a system. Each trace file contains events with associated
   timestamps based on the local clock of their respective system, which
   are not perfectly synchronized. To monitor all behavior in multi-core
   distributed systems, a global time reference is required, thus the need
   for traces synchronization techniques. The synchronization is time
   consuming when there is a cluster of many computers. In this paper we
   propose an optimized technique to reduce the total synchronization time.
   Compared with related techniques that have been used on kernel level
   traces, this method improves the performance while maintaining a high
   accuracy. It uses the packet rate and the hop count as two major
   criteria to focus the computation on more accurate network links during
   synchronization. These criteria, tested in real-word experiments, were
   identified as most important features of a network. Furthermore, we
   present numerical and analytical evaluation results, and compare these
   with previous methods demonstrating the accuracy and the performance of
   the method.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers joint production control and product quality
   specifications decision making in unreliable multiple-product
   manufacturing system. This is with the knowledge that an optimum
   compromise should guide the decision making process. In fact, tight
   process specifications will generally lead to products with good quality
   and higher market values, but at the same time associated with a higher
   rate of non-conforming parts rejection leading to higher non quality
   costs and lower plant productivity. Moreover, in unreliable
   manufacturing context the decision maker should adopt an adequate
   production policy to hedge against future capacity shortages caused by
   machine failures in order to meet customer demand. This paper intends to
   extend previous findings to tackle this problem and study the overall
   decision making process aiming to guide the production and quality
   specification decisions in multiple-product context. The overall optimal
   decision policy is defined here as one that maximises the long term
   average per unit time profit of a combined measure of quality and
   quantity dependent sales revenue, minus inventory and backlog costs, in
   the presence of random plant failures and random repair durations.}},

   Consequently, 31 risk estimation tools were compared by using them to
   estimate risk levels associated with 20 hazardous situations. Risk
   estimation appears to be tool-dependent, as different tools give
   different results with identical hazardous situations. The scope of the
   tool, its use, and construction could explain these differences. This
   article also proposes a series of rules for constructing tools to
   alleviate many problems associated with the variability of risk

Volume = {{17}},

Pages = {{377-383}},
Abstract = {{Hybrid III dummies used for collision testing in the automotive industry
   include passive hands that cannot produce any grasping force. Such
   capability would be useful in low-acceleration collisions or vehicle
   tipover investigations, since grasping force and hand stiffness may
   impact the dummy movements during impact. In the context of studying the
   need for restraining devices for drivers in forklift tilting accidents,
   a new hand gripper compatible with the Hybrid III dummy was designed to
   replicate hand grasp capabilities, namely its grip force and stiffness
   on a steering wheel. A theoretical model of the device was developed to
   figure out a set of configuration parameters that replicate human hand
   grasping force and stiffness. Extraction force, manually tuned by a
   compression spring, was analytically characterised and validated
   experimentally with a prototype on a uniaxial traction machine. The
   system exhibits a non-intuitive behaviour, both in terms of extraction
   force and axial stiffness, due in part to the non-conservative friction
   forces involved. Tuning simplicity, low cost and robustness were
   desirable design constraints given the intended usage.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a deformity of the spine
   manifested by asymmetry and deformities of the external surface of the
   trunk. Classification of scoliosis deformities according to curve type
   is used to plan management of scoliosis patients. Currently, scoliosis
   curve type is determined based on X-ray exam. However, cumulative
   exposure to X-rays radiation significantly increases the risk for
   certain cancer. In this paper, we propose a robust system that can
   classify the scoliosis curve type from non invasive acquisition of 3D
   trunk surface of the patients. The 3D image of the trunk is divided into
   patches and local geometric descriptors characterizing the surface of
   the back are computed from each patch and forming the features. We
   perform the reduction of the dimensionality by using Principal Component
   Analysis and 53 components were retained. In this work a multi-class
   classifier is built with Least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM)
   which is a kernel classifier. For this study, a new kernel was designed
   in order to achieve a robust classifier in comparison with polynomial
   and Gaussian kernel. The proposed system was validated using data of 103
   patients with different scoliosis curve types diagnosed and classified
   by an orthopedic surgeon from the X-ray images. The average rate of
   successful classification was 93.3\% with a better rate of prediction
   for the major thoracic and lumbar/thoracolumbar types.}},

Abstract = {{We describe an improved technique for handling large numbers of cutting
   planes when using an interior-point method for the solution of linear
   and semi-definite programming relaxations of combinatorial optimization
   problems. The approach combines an infeasible primal-dual interior-point
   algorithm with a cutting-plane scheme that does not solve successive
   relaxations to optimality, but adds and removes cuts at intermediate
   iterates based on indicators for cut violation and feasibility of the
   associated slacks. The slack variables of added cuts are initialized
   using a recently proposed interior-point warm-start technique that
   relaxes the interiority condition on the original primal-dual variables
   and enables a restart from the current iterate without additional
   centring or correction steps. Our computational tests on relaxations of
   the maximum-cut and single-row facility-layout problem demonstrate that
   this new scheme is robust for both unconstrained and constrained binary
   quadratic problems and that its performance is superior to solving only
   the final relaxation with all relevant cuts known in advance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a framework for trade-off analyses of blackbox
   constrained optimization problems. Two strategies are developed to show
   the trade-off of the optimal objective function value with tightening or
   loosening general constraints. These are a simple method which may be
   performed immediately after a single optimization and a detailed method
   performing biobjective optimization on the minimization of the objective
   versus a constraint of interest. The detailed method provides points on
   the Pareto front, the trade-off curve, of the objective versus a chosen
   constraint. The simple method provides points near the trade-off curve,
   which may be all the designer needs. The trade-off information is
   generally used by engineers rather than the first-order sensitivity
   estimates provided by the Lagrange multipliers, which only provide the
   tangent to the Pareto front at the solution found. The proposed methods
   are tested on an academic test case and on an engineering problem using
   the mesh-adaptive direct search algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Cavity ring down measurement approach is a promising technique for
   biosensing as it is insensitive to intensity fluctuations of a laser
   source. This technique in conjunction with ultra high Q microcavities
   have a great potential for ultra sensitive biosensing. Until now, most
   work on microcavity biosensors has been based on measurement of the
   resonant frequency shift induced by binding event on surface of the
   microcavity. Such measurements suffer from the noise due to intensity
   fluctuations of the laser source. However, the binding event will also
   introduce shift in quality factor of the microcavity, which can be
   tracked by using cavity ring down spectroscopy. In this work, we report
   on experimental demonstration of application of ring down measurement
   approach to microcavities for biosensing by tracking disassociation
   phase of a biotin-streptavidin reaction. These measurements were
   performed by using a bioconjugated ultra high Q microtoroidal cavity
   immersed in a liquid microacquarium. We found that disassociation curves
   agree with previously reported results on the protein kinetics
   measurements.}},

Abstract = {{This article contributes to the growing research and policy interest on
   the challenges of achieving socially sustainable transportation. It
   analyses the determinants of transport mode use for journey to work

   multinomial logistic regression models were estimated to assess the
   personal, social and economic factors that affect travel mode use of
   low-income persons in their journey to work in urban areas in Ontario
   and Quebec. The findings show important differences in the factors
   associated with car driving and public transit, between genders, and
   according to income level, educational achievement, household structure
   and immigration status. Furthermore, it is found that significant
   factors affecting travel mode use among low-income people in various
   urban areas are differentiated by province. The results point towards a
   geographic-based and balanced promotion of public and private mobility
   programmes and policies to address transport needs of low-income

Abstract = {{To ensure widespread deployment and popularity, next generation wireless

   However, because of the failure-prone nature of wireless networks,
   providing a reliable communication link and guaranteeing a consistent
   QoS to users become key issues. In this tutorial, we describe the most
   common source of failures in wireless networks and provide a systematic
   failure classification procedure. Drawing from the vast literature on
   reliability in wireline networks, we then explain how cognitive radios
   can use their inherent capabilities to implement efficient prevention
   and recovery mechanisms to combat failures and thereby provide reliable
   communications and consistent QoS under all circumstances.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the hardware-in-the-loop simulation (HILS) of an

   The hardware-in-the-loop controller used is designed to command a real

   means that the simulated robot will act virtually in the real
   environment. Constrained and unconstrained simulation schemes are

Abstract = {{The choice of an appropriate end-of-life (EOL) destination for discarded
   products is becoming an important issue for most manufactured products,
   given the current problems of environmental waste impact and landfill
   saturation. To address these issues, the design of a product must be
   optimised with a view to incorporating in that product an
   environmentally sustainable EOL scenario that respects economic and
   legislative constraints. The new EOL scenario evaluation method (ELSEM)
   that we propose in this paper takes these fundamental aspects into
   account, and provides a method for evaluating the various options for
   the EOL scenario of a product during early design phase. The ELSEM
   provides a simple and intuitive tool for designers to help them
   construct arguments for the EOL decision-making process. It is built
   using the fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal
   solution method, a multi-criteria decision process that is highly
   appropriate in the uncertain and subjective environment in which the
   designer works during the early stages of product development. Our
   method is illustrated with a case study involving a vehicle engine.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL REACTOR ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{10}},
Abstract = {{For successful design and operation of Liquid-Solid (LS) and
   Gas-Liquid-Solid (GLS) stirred tank reactors engineers and scientists
   must define geometrical and operating conditions for a specific medium
   (specified physical properties) in such a way that provides the optimum
   level of solid suspension. Failure to design the stirred tank reactor to
   achieve optimum conditions and maintain the system at these conditions
   during operation may be detrimental to product quality (selectivity and
   yield) and cost. Successful design and operation require comprehensive
   knowledge about how the state of solid suspension may be affected by
   changing physical, operational, and geometrical parameters. Also,
   accurate correlations are necessary to fulfill that objective. This
   article intends to provide that background for scientists and engineers.
   It critically surveys the published work in this field and makes
   specific recommendations for the appropriate conditions that provide the

   Problems}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{173-210}},
Abstract = {{Designing a search heuristic for constraint programming that is reliable
   across problem domains has been an important research topic in recent
   years. This paper concentrates on one family of candidates:
   counting-based search. Such heuristics seek to make branching decisions
   that preserve most of the solutions by determining what proportion of
   solutions to each individual constraint agree with that decision.
   Whereas most generic search heuristics in constraint programming rely on
   local information at the level of the individual variable, our search
   heuristics are based on more global information at the constraint level.
   We design several algorithms that are used to count the number of
   solutions to specific families of constraints and propose some search
   heuristics exploiting such information. The experimental part of the
   paper considers eight problem domains ranging from well-established
   benchmark puzzles to rostering and sport scheduling. An initial
   empirical analysis identifies heuristic maxSD as a robust candidate
   among our proposals. We then evaluate the latter against the state of
   the art, including the latest generic search heuristics, restarts, and
   discrepancy-based tree traversals. Experimental results show that
   counting-based search generally outperforms other generic heuristics.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a numerical study on natural convection from a
   protruding heater located at the bottom of a square cavity filled with a
   copper-water nanofluid. The vertical walls of the cavity are cooled
   isothermally; the horizontal ones are adiabatic, and the heater is
   attached to the bottom wall. The heat source is assumed either to be
   isothermal or to have a constant heat flux. The effective viscosity and
   thermal conductivity of the nanofluid are modeled according to Brinkman
   and Patel, respectively. Numerical solutions of the full-governing
   equations, based on the lattice Boltzmann method, are obtained for a
   wide range of the governing parameters: the Rayleigh number, Ra; the
   Prandtl number, Pr; the geometrical parameters specifying the heater;
   the volume fraction of nanoparticles, Phi. For a particular geometry, it
   has been found that, for a given Ra, heat transfer is enhanced with
   increasing Phi, independently of the thermal boundary condition applied
   on the heater.}},

   for nontoxic polynucleotide delivery}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{1399-1414}},
Abstract = {{Chitosan, a natural polymer, is a promising system for the therapeutic
   delivery of both plasmid DNA and synthetic small interfering RNA.
   Reports attempting to identify the optimal parameters of chitosan for
   synthetic small interfering RNA delivery were inconclusive with high
   molecular weight at high amine-to-phosphate (N:P) ratios apparently
   required for efficient transfection. Here we show, for the first time,
   that low molecular weight chitosan (LMW-CS) formulations at low N:P
   ratios are suitable for the in vitro delivery of small interfering RNA.
   LMW-CS nanoparticles at low N:P ratios were positively charged
   (zeta-potential similar to 20 mV) with an average size below 100 nm as
   demonstrated by dynamic light scattering and environmental scanning
   electron microscopy, respectively. Nanoparticles were spherical, a shape
   promoting decreased cytotoxicity and enhanced cellular uptake.
   Nanoparticle stability was effective for at least 20 hours at N:P ratios
   above two in a slightly acidic pH of 6.5. At a higher basic pH of 8,
   these nanoparticles were unravelled due to chitosan neutralization,
   exposing their polynucleotide cargo. Cellular uptake ranged from 50\% to
   95\% in six different cell lines as measured by cytometry. Increasing
   chitosan molecular weight improved nanoparticle stability as well as the
   ability of nanoparticles to protect the oligonucleotide cargo from
   nucleases at supraphysiological concentrations. The highest knockdown
   efficiency was obtained with the specific formulation 92-10-5 that
   combines sufficient nuclease protection with effective intracellular
   release. This system attained >70\% knockdown of the messenger RNA,
   similar to commercially available lipoplexes, without apparent
   cytotoxicity. Contrary to previous reports, our data demonstrate that
   LMW-CS at low N:P ratios are efficient and nontoxic polynucleotide
   delivery systems capable of transfecting a plethora of cell lines.}},

Abstract = {{We propose an interior-point algorithm based on an elastic formulation
   of the l(1)-penalty merit function for mathematical programs with
   complementarity constraints. The salient feature of our method is that
   it requires no prior knowledge of which constraints, if any, are
   complementarity constraints. Remarkably, the method allows for a unified
   treatment of both general, unstructured, degenerate problems and
   structured degenerate problems, such as problems with complementarity
   constraints, with no changes to accommodate one class or the other. Our
   results refine those of Gould, Orban, and Toint (2010) by isolating the
   degeneracy due to the complementarity constraints. The method naturally
   converges to a strongly stationary point or delivers a relevant
   certificate of degeneracy without recourse to second-order intermediate
   solutions. Preliminary numerical results on a standard test set
   illustrate the flexibility of the approach.}},

   larger cross-sections. As the size of mold blocks increases, it becomes
   more difficult to maintain the same microstructure throughout their
   volume. Thus, the size of mold steel blocks is limited by the cooling
   rate reachable at their center. This situation has created the need for
   the development of new alloys with improved hardenability. Additions of
   vanadium up to 0.35 wt-\% have been made to P20 + 0.5Ni mold steel. The
   addition of vanadium significantly increased hardenability, allowing the
   production of pre-hardened blocks with a cross section 88\% larger than
   the same alloy without vanadium. Such additions of vanadium also
   increased the impact toughness by 120\%, raised the yield strength by
   17\% and improved hardness after tempering by 24\%. The effect of boron
   on the hardenability of the P20 + 0.5Ni steel was also investigated. It
   resulted in a significant increase in hardenability and, in theory,
   could permit the production of pre-hardened blocks with a cross-section
   400\% larger than the original material. Finally, our results show that
   0.35 wt-\% of Ni can be substituted by 0.15 wt-\% of vanadium in a P20 +
   0.5Ni steel and still maintain the same hardenability.}},

Abstract = {{The present study aims to establish a compensation strategy to improve
   the accuracy of the end mill boring in order to replace the boring bar
   method to machine a hole. First, an experimental approach based on KGM
   circular tests is used to investigate the main sources of errors which
   affect circular contouring accuracy at different feed rates and
   trajectory radii for two types of machine tool. Then, boring of aluminum
   parts is performed on a Mitsui Seiki HU40-T five-axis machining centre
   using two different processes, boring with a boring bar and boring with
   a high-speed end mill. Next, a simple experimental model based on
   statistical tests is developed and used to predict the radius size
   errors. Finally, a compensation strategy is applied to improve the
   accuracy of the end mill boring process. KGM circular tests results show
   that the machine exhibits radius size errors that are significant. It
   also shows that backlash and reversal spikes are important sources of
   error which affect out-of-roundness. After applying the compensation
   strategy, machining results show that bores machined through high-speed
   end mill have a quality similar to those machined with the boring bar
   while maintaining the high feed rates and thus high productivity.}},

Abstract = {{The stability of gold nanoparticles synthesised by sputter deposition
   has been studied in situ in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium ionic liquids
   with bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide, tetrafluoroborate,
   hexafluorophosphate and dicyanamide anions with UV-VIS absorption
   spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Besides the growth of
   the gold nanoparticles, two other processes were observed after
   sputtering, namely aggregation and sedimentation of these nanoparticles.
   To model the absorption spectra of the sputtered gold nanoparticles,
   generalized multiparticle Mie calculations were performed. These
   theoretical calculations confirm the increase in absorbance at longer
   wavelength for larger aggregates and are in agreement with the
   experimental observations. It was found that the kinetics of aggregation
   and sedimentation scale with the viscosity of the ionic liquid. Small
   amounts of water were found to have a large detrimental influence on the
   stability of the colloidal suspensions of the gold nanoparticles in
   ionic liquids. From the large discrepancy between the theoretical and
   the experimentally observed stability of the NPs, it was concluded that
   structural forces stabilize the gold nanoparticles. This was also borne
   out by AFM measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Reducing Emergency Department (ED) overcrowding in the hope of improving
   the ED's operational efficiency and health care delivery ranks high on
   every health care decision maker's wish list. The current study
   concentrates on developing efficient work shift schedules that make the
   best use of current resource capacity with the objectives of reducing
   patient waiting time and leveling resource utilization as much as
   possible. The study introduces two iterative heuristic algorithms, which
   combine simulation and optimization models for scheduling the work
   shifts of the ED resources: physicians, nurses and technicians. The
   algorithms are distinctive because they account for patients being
   treated by multiple care providers, possibly over the course of several
   hours, often with interspersed waiting. In such instances, patient
   arrival time is not a good indicator of when the various care providers
   are needed. The algorithms were tested using a detailed simulation based
   on data from five general hospital EDs. A patient's Length of Stay (LOS)
   is measured as the time a patient spends in the ED until being admitted
   to the hospital or discharged. The first algorithm achieved an average
   reduction of between 20 and 45\% in the total patient waiting time,
   which led to a reduction of between 7 and 17\% in the combined average
   patient LOS. By allowing a restructure of the ED resource capacities,
   the second algorithm achieved an average reduction of between 20 and
   64\% in the total patient waiting time, leading to an 11 to 29\%
   reduction in the combined average patient LOS.}},

Abstract = {{Realistic modeling of complex nonlinear behaviour and potential failure
   of steel braces attributable to Ultra-Low Cycle Fatigue (ULCF) is
   necessary to accurately assess the seismic performance of steel braced
   frames. Recently, micromechanical models capable of predicting the
   earthquake-induced ULCF have been developed. This paper presents an
   in-depth simulation of test results and detailed evaluation of the
   available local micromechanical models on predicting the initiation of
   crack under ULCF loading regime. Five HSS steel braces with square
   cross-section that were recently tested were selected for the study. The
   braces have 4 to 6 meters in length; have slenderness ratios of 40 and
   60, and width-to-thickness aspect ratios of 17 and 24. Cyclic hardening
   parameters used in the models have been obtained from monotonic and
   cyclic coupon tests. The refined Cyclic Void Growth Model (CVGM) that
   can predict the initiation of crack in ductile fracture is employed and
   the analysis results are presented. Modeling techniques and the
   selection of the influencing parameters in the utilized finite element
   models including the cyclic hardening parameters are explained in this
   paper. Models simulated the overall and local behaviour of the specimens
   including the instance and the location of ductile fracture, after the
   onset of local buckling where the strain demand raised and the plastic
   hinging formed. These analyses are computationally expensive; however,
   the models are capable of predicting the observed brace behaviour under
   the applied loading regimes featuring the potential for extending the
   results to a range of braces with different geometric dimensions.}},

   loading to evaluate the failure modes, ductility and predictability.
   Various failure modes were observed, including failure of the bolts,
   failure of the gusset plates, failure of the gusset plate-to-column or
   beam welds, block shear tear out of the brace as well as net brace
   yielding followed by section fracture. These failure modes ranged from

   in-plane shear and flexural deformations that add to the lateral
   deformations of the vertical bracing system. The in-plane flexibility of
   the diaphragm may also lengthen the building period compared to
   structures with rigid diaphragms. This paper describes a field test
   program performed on a typical single-storey steel braced frame building
   located in Montreal, Canada. Measurements were taken under three
   conditions: ambient vibration, forced vibration and pull \& release
   testing. The impact of removing bracing members in a braced bay located
   at mid-length of the building was also examined. Numerical models of the
   structure accounting for the flexibility of the roof diaphragm were used
   to predict the periods. The results show that the amplitude of
   excitation influences the period of the structure. The numerical
   predictions agreed with the high amplitude period measurements.}},

Abstract = {{The seismic performance of steel braced frames with bracing members
   intersecting columns between ground and roof levels in tall
   single-storey steel buildings is examined. Dividing the storey height in
   multiple X-bracing panels permits to reduce the length of the bracing
   elements, so that smaller brace sections can be selected while meeting
   the brace strength requirements and overall slenderness limits imposed
   by codes. Push-over analysis was performed to assess the performance of
   these frames. The influence of the relative height of the bracing
   panels, the presence of an intermediate strut, and the bending moment
   used for the design of the columns is studied. The numerical analyses
   showed that all these parameters may affect the amplitude and vertical
   distribution of brace buckling and yielding in the frame. Uneven
   distribution of inelastic response, with in-plane bending moment demand,
   is confirmed by nonlinear time history analysis.}},

   Building Code of Canada and the CSA-S16.1-M78 steel design standard to

   design requirements. Tension-only X-bracing and tension-compression
   chevron bracing built with back-to-back double angle braces are selected
   being most commonly used some 30 years ago. No ductility verifications
   are considered in design, consistent with Canadian seismic design
   practice prior to 1989. Seismic design loads prescribed in the 2010 code
   are higher than the 1980 values, especially for the 10-storey building.
   Nearly all braces and all brace connections of all frames studied have
   insufficient capacity compared to the demand from current codes. Failure
   of beams and columns is also a possibility for the 10-storey frames.
   Beams in the 4-storey frame are adequate and excessive demand on columns

Abstract = {{Steel braced frames that are designed to rock on their foundations have
   been proposed as an efficient way to resist seismic loads without
   structural damage or residual deformations. Although such systems have
   been shown to exhibit a desirable self-centering response, there have
   been concerns that higher mode effects cause excessive amplification of
   member design forces. To mitigate these effects, multiple structural
   fuses are proposed. This paper presents shake table test results from an
   eight-storey rocking steel frame that was tested at 30\% scale. The
   frame was designed to be able to rock at the base only, or also at
   midheight. In addition, the first-storey brace was designed to be
   replaced with a Self-Centering Energy-Dissipating (SCED) brace. Both of
   these secondary fuses were effective in reducing the shear and bending
   moment envelopes for the frame with only minor increases in the peak
   structural displacements.}},

Abstract = {{Population segregation measurement is a topic of broad interest in the
   social sciences. In this paper we draw from recent advances in the
   spatial analysis literature to derive individualized measures of
   clustering and exposure. Recent research on accessibility has seen a
   shift from place-based measures to person-based ones. Similarly, the
   notion of residential clustering and exposure patterns, while typically
   related to the distribution of population in zonal systems, can be
   modified to account for heterogeneous experiences of urban space. In
   particular, at the individual level, the degree of clustering and
   exposure is related to personal mobility and the individual experience
   of space. In this paper we turn to the question of whether individuals
   belonging to different groups and living in different areas of a city
   observe differences in their clustering and exposure to population
   groups over space. The proposed procedure is applied empirically to the
   case of Montreal to explore how native English speakers of various
   levels of mobility experience exposure.}},

Abstract = {{The prismatic VHTR neutronic simulation presents challenges due to
   thermalization of the neutrons in the graphite reflector which leads to
   a spectral change in the peripheral fuel blocks. Two calculation schemes
   were tested on a simple 2D core calculation: a single block path wherein
   a classical single block lattice calculation provides the homogenized
   cross-sections, and a supercell path where the homogenized
   cross-sections are generated using a lattice of a fuel block surrounded
   by some of its surroundings. In both paths, several group condensations
   were performed to assess the effect of increasing the number of groups
   in the core calculation from 2 to 295. Core and lattice calculations
   were validated with respect to MCNP. The study revealed that the
   supercells lead to improvement in the calculation of power shape over
   the single-block path. This improvement is rather pronounced with small
   numbers of energy groups. For larger numbers of energy groups, however,
   both solution methods appear to yield adequate accuracy and the
   improvement gained through supercells in these cases may not warrant the
   computational cost. Lattice depletion calculations also show that the
   presence of the reflector creates strong heterogeneities on isotopic
   densities after 1000 days of burning. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The optimal design of an energy-intensive process involves a compromise
   between costs and greenhouse gas emissions, complicated by the
   interaction between optimal process emissions and supply chain
   emissions. We propose a method that combines generic abatement cost
   estimates and the results of existing (LCA) life cycle assessment
   studies, so that supply chain emissions are properly handled during
   optimization. This method is illustrated for a (NGCC) natural gas
   combined cycle power plant model with the following design and
   procurement options: procurement of natural gas from low-emissions
   producers, fuel substitution with (SNG) synthetic natural gas from wood,
   and variable-rate CO2 capture and sequestration from both the NGCC and
   SNG plants. Using multi-objective optimization, we show two
   Pareto-optimal sets with and without the proposed LCA method. The latter
   can then be shown to misestimate CO2 abatement costs by a few percent,
   penalizing alternate fuels and energy-efficient process configurations
   and leading to sub-optimal design decisions with potential net losses of
   the order of \$1/MWh. Thus, the proposed LCA method can enhance the
   economic analysis of emissions abatement technologies and emissions
   legislation in general. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{28}},
Pages = {{232-243}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Galloping of square cylinders is studied at low values of the Reynolds
   number using a two-dimensional finite element method. A sinusoidal
   quasi-steady model allows determination of the occurrence of galloping
   and its amplitude. Parameters of this model are obtained via FEM
   unsteady simulations at different angles of incidence between 0 degrees
   and 10 degrees. The model efficiency is validated by comparing its
   predictions to those of unsteady simulations of fluid structure
   interaction of a spring mounted square constrained to move in the
   direction transverse to the flow. Results show that the model yields
   good predictions of both the onset of galloping and its amplitude as a
   function of the Reynolds number at high values of the mass ratio.
   However, the quasi-steady model fails to reproduce the sudden change of
   amplitudes observed in finite element simulations at mass ratios below a
   critical value. Modifications to the model are introduced to reproduce
   this low mass ratio effect. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Water samples from streams, brooks and storm sewer outfall pipes that
   collect storm waters across the Island of Montreal were analyzed for
   caffeine, carbamazepine and fecal coliforms. All samples contained
   various concentrations of these tracers, indicating a widespread
   sanitary contamination in urban environments. Fecal coliforms and
   caffeine levels ranged over several orders of magnitude with a modest
   correlation between caffeine and fecal coliforms (R-2 value of 0.558).
   An arbitrary threshold of 400 ng caffeine L-1 allows us to identify
   samples with an elevated fecal contamination, as defined by more than
   200 colony-forming units per 100 mL (cfu 100 mL(-1)) of fecal coliforms.
   Low caffeine levels were sporadically related to high fecal coliform
   counts. Lower levels of caffeine and fecal coliforms were observed in
   the brooks while the larger streams and storm water discharge points
   contained over ten times more. The carbamazepine data showed little or
   no apparent correlation to caffeine. These data suggest that this storm
   water collection system, located in a highly urbanized urban
   environment, is widely contaminated by domestic sewers as indicated by
   the ubiquitous presence of fecal contaminants as well as caffeine and
   carbamazepine. Caffeine concentrations were relatively well correlated
   to fecal coliforms, and could potentially be used as a chemical
   indicator of the level of contamination by sanitary sources. The
   carbamazepine data was not significantly correlated to fecal coliforms
   and of little use in this dataset. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents a real-time dynamic substructuring (RTDS) test
   program that was carried out on a bridge structure equipped with seismic
   isolators with self-centering and friction energy dissipation
   capabilities. The structure studied also included bearing units with
   sliding interfaces providing additional energy dissipation capacity. In
   the RTDS tests, the seismic isolator was physically tested in the
   laboratory by using a high performance dynamic structural actuator
   imposing, in real time, the displacement time-histories obtained from
   numerical simulations that were run in parallel. The integration scheme
   used in the test program was the Rosenbrock-W variant and the
   integration was performed by using the MathWorks's Simulink and an XPC
   target computer environment. The numerical counterpart included the
   bridge piers and the additional energy dissipation properties. The
   nonlinear response of these components was accounted for in the
   numerical models. The RTDS tests were performed in the direction
   parallel to the length of the bridge. The effects of various ground
   motions and the influence of modeling assumptions such as friction and
   column stiffness were investigated. Finally, the test results were
   compared to the predictions from dynamic time-history analyses performed
   by using commercially available computer programs. The results indicate
   that simple numerical modeling techniques can lead to an accurate
   prediction of the displacement response of the bridge seismic protective
   systems studied. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)BE.1943-5592.0000199. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Field observations, deformation and fabric analyses, and precise age
   data acquired by zircon SHRIMP, LA-ICP-MS U-Pb and Ar-40-Ar-39 dating
   methods have yielded new constraints on the kinematics and dynamics of
   the Namche Barwa Syntaxis (NBS) which is the eastern corner of the
   Himalaya. A two-stage model has been established to explain the
   formation and evolution of the NBS. The northward indentation of the
   Indian plate beneath the Lhasa terrane began at 55-40 Ma, and crustal
   materials at this corner were subducted to depths >70 km where they
   experienced HP (UHP?) metamorphism. Since 40 Ma, large-scale,
   right-lateral strike-slip along the Sagaing fault has accommodated the
   rapid northward movement of the eastern Indian plate corner with respect
   to the Indochina block. This caused significant and progressive bending
   of the Indus-Yarlung suture zone (IYSZ) such that it became the
   Dongjiu-Milin left-lateral, strike-slip, shear zone (DMSZ) in the west
   and the Aniqiao-Motuo right-lateral, strike-slip, shear zone (AMSZ) in
   the east. Both zones underwent strong mylonitization. Meanwhile, the HP
   (UHP?) metamorphic rocks were rapidly exhumed, first into the deep crust
   at 22-18 Ma and then to the shallow crust to form an antiformal dome at
   6-2 Ma. Our model provides new insight into the processes of
   post-collisional crustal thickening related to the formation of the
   Himalayan orogenic belt. (C) 2011 International Association for Gondwana

   considerable increase (by similar to 10(4)) in the absorption cross

   (DRV). Due to intra-die variations in process parameters, the DRV of
   cells differ within a single memory die. Hence, the minimum applicable
   standby voltage to a memory die (V-DDLmin) is determined by the maximum
   DRV among its constituent cells. On the other hand, inter-die variations
   result in a die-to-die variation of V-DDLmin. Applying an identical
   standby voltage to all dies, regardless of their corresponding V-DDLmin,
   can result in the failure of some dies, due to data-retention failures
   (DRFs), entailing yield losses. In this work, we first show that the
   yield losses can be significant if the standby voltage of SRAMs is
   reduced aggressively. Then, we propose a postsilicon standby voltage
   tuning scheme to avoid the yield losses due to DRFs, while reducing the
   leakage currents effectively. Simulation results in a 45-nm predictive
   technology show that tuning standby voltage of SRAMs can enhance
   data-retention yield by 10\%-50\%.}},

Abstract = {{Carsharing is an innovative travel alternative that has recently
   experienced considerable growth and become part of sustainable
   transportation initiatives. Although carsharing is becoming increasingly
   a popular alternative transportation mode in North America, it is still
   an under-researched area. Current research is aimed at better
   understanding of the behavior of carsharing users. For every member, a
   two-stage approach microsimulates the probability of being active in any
   month using a binary probit model and given that a particular member is
   active during a month, the probability of that member using the service
   multiple times using a random utility-based model. The model is
   estimated using empirical data from one of the largest carsharing
   companies in North America. The model estimates reveal that the activity
   persistency of members is positively linked to previous behaviors for up
   to 4 months, and that the influence of previous months weakens over
   time. It also shows that some attributes of the traveler (gender, age,
   and language spoken at home) impact his or her behaviors. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{Fusionless growth modulation is an attractive alternative to
   conventional treatments of idiopathic scoliosis. To date, fusionless
   devices achieve unilateral growth modulation by compressing the
   intervertebral disc. This study explores a device to control spinal
   alignment and vertebral morphology via growth modulation while excluding
   the disc in a porcine model.
   A device that locally encloses the vertebral growth plate exclusive of
   the disc was introduced anteriorly over T5-T8 in four immature pigs
   (experimental) while three underwent surgery without instrumentation
   (sham) and two were selected as controls. Bi-weekly coronal and lateral
   radiographs were taken over the 12-week follow-up to document vertebral
   morphology and spinal alignment modifications via an inverse approach
   (creation of deformity).
   All animals completed the experiment with no postoperative
   complications. Control and sham groups showed no significant changes in
   spinal alignment. Experimental group achieved a final coronal Cobb angle
   of 6.5A degrees A A +/- A 3.5A degrees (constrained to the four
   instrumented levels) and no alteration to the sagittal profile was
   observed. Solely the experimental group ended with consistent vertebral
   wedging of 4.1A degrees A A +/- A 3.6A degrees amounting to a cumulative
   wedging of up to 25A degrees and a concurring difference in left/right
   vertebral height of 1.24 +/- A 1.86 mm in the coronal plane.
   The proposed intravertebral epiphyseal device, for the early treatment
   of progressive idiopathic scoliosis, demonstrated its feasibility by
   manipulating spinal alignment through the realization of local growth
   modulation exclusive of the intervertebral disc.}},

Abstract = {{A compact multilayer non-commensurate C-section dispersive delay

   was uniplanar and used edge-coupled C-sections, this DDS is based on
   broadside-coupled C-sections, and hence achieves a much larger ratio of
   group delay swing to frequency bandwidth, leading to higher ASP
   resolution. Moreover, it is much more compact, while maintaining
   acceptable insertion loss. After a parametric characterization of a
   mono-block commensurate multilayer DDS, with varied strip widths, two
   multiblock non-commensurate DDSs with linear group delay slopes are
   demonstrated by full-wave simulation and experimental low-temperature
   co-fired ceramics results. The proposed DDS exhibits a significant
   footprint reduction factor of around 7 compared to its uniplanar

Abstract = {{A compact parallel-coupled transmission line section, connected at their
   both ends, is presented to obtain multiple transmission zeros. As much
   as five transmission zeros can be obtained. The zeros can be arranged to
   design a sharp rejection wideband bandstop filter (BSF). A lossless
   transmission line model is used to analyze the structure and hence to
   obtain closed form expressions for the S-parameters and design graphs to
   facilitate the filter synthesis procedure. Theoretical predictions are
   validated by fabricating a BSF in microstrip line technology. The single
   filter unit provides 29 dB stopband over a fractional bandwidth of 60\%
   at the mid-band frequency of 1.47 GHz.}},

Abstract = {{Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a multifunctional cytokine
   that regulates a wide variety of cellular processes including
   proliferation, differentiation, and extracellular matrix deposition.
   Dysregulation of TGF-beta signaling is associated with several diseases
   such as cancer and tissue fibrosis. TGF-beta signals through two
   transmembrane proteins known as the type I (TGFBR1) and type II (TGFBR2)
   receptors. The levels of these receptors at the cell surface are tightly
   regulated by several mechanisms, including degradation following
   recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin ligase SMAD ubiquitination regulatory
   factor (Smurf) 2 by SMAD7. In addition, TGF-beta co-receptors can
   modulate TGF-beta signaling receptor activity in a cell-specific manner.
   We have previously identified a novel TGF-beta co-receptor, CD109, a
   glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein that negatively
   regulates TGF-beta signaling. Despite CD109's potential relevance as a
   regulator of TGF-beta action in vivo, the mechanisms by which CD109
   regulates TGF-beta signaling are still incompletely understood.
   Previously, we have shown that CD109 downregulates TGF-beta signaling by
   promoting TGF-beta receptor localization into the lipid raft/caveolae
   compartment and by enhancing TGF-beta receptor degradation. Here, we
   demonstrate that CD109 enhances SMAD7/Smurf2-mediated degradation of
   TGFBR1 in a ligand-dependent manner. Moreover, we show that CD109
   regulates the localization and the association of SMAD7/Smurf2 with
   TGFBR1. Finally, we demonstrate that CD109's inhibitory effect on
   TGF-beta signaling and responses require SMAD7 expression and Smurf2
   ubiquitin ligase activity. Taken together, these results suggest that
   CD109 is an important regulator of SMAD7/Smurf2-mediated degradation of
   TGFBR1. J. Cell. Biochem. 113: 238246, 2012. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{This paper surveys recent research on CMOS silicon avalanche photodiodes
   ( SiAPD) and presents the design of a SiAPD based photoreceiver
   dedicated to nearinfrared spectroscopy ( NIRS) application.
   Near-infrared spectroscopy provides an inexpensive, non-invasive, and
   portable means to image brain function, and is one of the most efficient
   diagnostic techniques of different neurological diseases. In NIRS
   system, brain tissue is penetrated by near-infrared ( NIR) radiation and
   the reflected signal is captured by a photodiode. Since the reflected
   NIR signal has very low amplitude, SiAPD is a better choice than regular
   photodiode for NIR signal detection due to SiAPD` s ability to amplify
   the photo generated signal by avalanche multiplication. Design
   requirements of using CMOS SiAPDs for NIR light detection are discussed,
   and the challenges of fabricating SiAPDs using standard CMOS process are
   addressed. Performances of state-ofthe- art CMOS SiAPDs with different
   device structures are summarized and compared. The efficacy of the
   proposed SiAPD based photoreceiver is confirmed by post layout
   simulation. Finally, the SiAPD and its associated circuits has been
   implemented in one chip using 0.35 lm standard CMOS technology for an
   integrated NIRS system.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, 3D models and 2D drawings are the main basic elements that
   together form and carry the product definition throughout the product
   lifecycle. With the advent of the Digital Product Definition trend,
   industries have been interested in adopting a Model-based Definition
   (MBD) approach that enables the integration of drawing annotations
   directly onto a 3D model, thereby minimizing the need to generate
   engineering drawings. This drawing-less environment requires a way to
   adequately carry the product definition throughout a product's lifecycle
   while supporting all of the downstream users' specific needs. The
   objective of this article is to present a solution to carry the
   Engineering Change Management (ECM) process in a drawing-less
   environment. Therefore, based on ECM process requirements from two
   Canadian aerospace companies, we propose an MBD dataset which consists
   of an MBD model and a distribution file. The proposed MBD dataset is
   evaluated and the MBD-driven ECM process is outlined. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Volume = {{90-91}},
Pages = {{28-41}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The elastic stress analysis of beam-column structures of uniaxial
   symmetrical variable cross-sections is developed using an extension of
   Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. The applied loads are general considering
   axial (P), flexure (M-x-M-y), shear (V-x-V-y), and torsion (T).
   Three-dimensional analytical solutions for normal and shear stresses are
   derived using sectional analysis with warping functions for variable
   boundaries in elevation. The differential equations of equilibrium and
   deformations are accounting for the variations in the geometrical
   properties of the cross-section and related boundary conditions. The
   strong form solution is then written in a weak form that is implemented
   in a 2D sectional finite element (FE) code assuming linear normal stress
   distribution. Three application examples are presented to validate the
   proposed sectional approach and illustrate its accuracy by comparing
   with results from full 3D FE analyses: (a) a slender rectangular section
   pier with a sloped boundary, (b) a bulk rectangular section buttress
   with unsymmetrical slopes, and (c) a pier (squat wall) for a hydraulic
   structure. When the assumption of linear distribution for normal
   flexural stress is satisfied, the proposed sectional approach produces
   results within 1\% of 3D FE with much reduced computational efforts. For
   bulk and squat walls the stress field distribution are very similar to
   3D FE while the stress intensity shows some variations. This is of major
   practical significance because the proposed approach allows performing
   first a series of simplified yet acceptable sectional analyses in safety
   assessment of the three-dimensional type of structures considered
   herein. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   each destination should be monitored. For this purpose, a middleware is
   required between the network and the applications, offering the tracking
   capabilities of disseminated information. In this paper, we propose a
   middleware architecture for disseminating delay-constrained information
   in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). In order to evaluate the feasibility
   of such architecture, a proof of concept of a real scenario is
   implemented. For performance evaluation, the end-to-end delay and the
   percentage of success related to the disseminated information are
   analyzed. Such analysis reveals that the middleware offers a percentage
   of success close to 98\%, which is highly superior to the success of
   individual resources, such as Short Message Services (SMS), emailing and
   twitter. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present a design and analysis study of guided-mode resonances in
   photonic crystal slabs. Three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain
   (FDTD) simulations are used in parallel with a simplified model of
   guided-mode resonances to produce a representation of their evolution
   with structural parameters. From the analysis of the effective medium
   behavior of the system, we propose a simplified method able to predict
   the first guided-mode resonances at normal incidence with a good
   accuracy (similar to 1\%) for holes with radius-to-period ratio smaller
   than 0.3 for the transverse magnetic polarization created internally. A
   substantial gain of time is, therefore, provided compared to FDTD (from
   the hours level to the seconds level). We also focus on two other
   important parameters, the quality factor and asymmetry of peaks, and
   present a way to design symmetric peaks with low sidebands. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Recently reported soft conductive-polymer-based capacitor fibers are
   used to build a fully woven 2D touchpad sensor and a 1D slide sensor. An
   individual capacitor fiber features a swiss-roll like structure having
   two dielectric and two conductive polymer films rolled together in a
   classic multilayer capacitor configuration. The soft fibers of sub-1 mm
   outer diameter are fabricated using a fiber drawing procedure from a
   macroscopic polymeric preform. An individual capacitor fiber is then
   demonstrated to act as a distributed sensor that allows the touch
   position to be determined by measuring the fiber's AC response. In other
   words, a single fiber acts as a 1D slide sensor. Furthermore, we develop
   an electrical ladder network model to predict the distributed sensor
   properties of an individual fiber and show that this model describes the
   experimental measurements very well. Finally, a two-dimensional touchpad
   sensor is presented. The sensor is built by weaving a one-dimensional
   array of capacitor fibers in parallel to each other. The performance of
   the touchpad sensor is then characterized.}},

Title = {{Assessment of alternative design schemes to reduce the edge losses in
   HTS power transmission cables made of coated conductors}},
Journal = {{SUPERCONDUCTOR SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of alternative designs
   to reduce the AC losses of high temperature superconducting (HTS) power
   transmission cables. The idea behind these designs is to undermine the
   edge effect, which is one of the main factors contributing to AC losses
   in HTS power cables made of coated tapes. The edge effect, which arises
   from the presence of gaps between the tapes, results in large normal
   components of magnetic field near the edges of the tapes and in turns
   leads to a current distribution with higher density near the edges. To
   perform our investigation we use a numerical technique developed in our
   previous work which allows us to consider the helical configuration of
   the tapes. Through numerical simulations we assess the effectiveness of
   two overlapped designs, i.e. a cyclic overlapped design and an
   anticyclic overlapped design, in reduction of AC losses in single layer
   HTS power cables made of coated tapes. Simulation results show that AC
   losses can be reduced by about 70\% as compared with a typical single
   layer cable.}},

Title = {{Integrating parking behaviour in activity-based travel demand modelling:
   Investigation of the relationship between parking type choice and

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{46}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Traditionally, the parking choice/option is considered to be an
   important factor in only in the mode choice component of a four-stage
   travel demand modelling system. However, travel demand modelling has
   been undergoing a paradigm shift from the traditional trip-based
   approach to an activity-based approach. The activity-based approach is
   intended to capture the influences of different policy variables at
   various stages of activity-travel decision making processes. Parking is
   a key policy variable that captures land use and transportation
   interactions in urban areas. It is important that the influences of
   parking choice on activity scheduling behaviour be identified fully.
   This paper investigates this issue using a sample data set collected in
   Montreal, Canada. Parking type choice and activity scheduling decision
   (start time choice) are modelled jointly in order to identify the
   effects of parking type choice on activity scheduling behaviour.
   Empirical investigation gives strong evidence that parking type choice
   influences activity scheduling process. The empirical findings of this
   investigation challenge the validity of the traditional conception which
   considers parking choice as exogenous variable only in the mode choice
   component of travel demand models. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In the present work, stable fluidization of sawdust was achieved in a
   bench fluidized bed with an inclined orifice distributor without inert
   bed materials. A solids circulation pattern was established in the bed
   without the presence of slugging and channeling. The effects of
   treatment severity and weight loss on the solid product properties were
   identified. The decomposition of hemicelluloses was found to be
   responsible for the significant changes of chemical, physical and
   mechanical properties of the torrefied sawdust, including energy
   content, particle size distribution and moisture absorption capacity.
   The hydrophobicity of the torrefied sawdust was improved over the raw
   sawdust with a reduction of around 40 wt.\% in saturated water uptake
   rate, and enhanced with increasing the treatment severity due to the
   decomposition of hemicelluloses which are rich in hydroxyl groups. The
   results in this study provided the basis for torrefaction in fluidized
   bed reactors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved,}},

   switches to produce the desired analog output signal. According to the
   proposed idea, an 8-bit DAC is designed, comprising a total capacitance
   of 11CUnit and 8 switches. The circuit was designed and simulated in a
   0.18-mu m standard CMOS technology with a supply voltage of 1.8V.
   Simulated INL of the DAC is in the range +0.42 LSB to -0.40 LSB and the

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a dual-edge sense amplifier flip-flop
   (DE-SAFF) using an improved clocking scheme to reduce area, power, and
   complexity. The proposed scheme does not require any changes on the
   single-edge flip-flop to enable dual-edge triggering. The extracted
   circuit layout of the proposed DE-SAFF has been simulated in TSMC 65-nm
   technology at a frequency of 2.5 GHz and a throughput of 5 GHz.
   Simulation results show correct functionality of the proposed flip-flop
   under process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. Comparing the
   proposed DE-SAFF to other flip-flops, show that in addition to reduced
   design complexity, the proposed flip-flop has low power consumption and
   a lower area.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the H-2 (Kalman) filtering problem in the situation
   where a signal estimate must be constructed based on inputs from
   individual participants, whose data must remain private. This problem
   arises in emerging applications such as smart grids or intelligent
   transportation systems, where users continuously send data to
   third-party aggregators performing global monitoring or control tasks,
   and require guarantees that this data cannot be used to infer additional
   personal information. To provide formal privacy guarantees against
   adversaries with arbitrary side information, we rely on the notion of
   differential privacy introduced relatively recently in the database
   literature. This notion is extended to dynamic systems with many
   participants contributing independent input signals, and mechanisms are
   then proposed to solve the H-2 filtering problem with a differential
   privacy constraint. A method for mitigating the impact of the
   privacy-inducing mechanism on the estimation performance is described,
   which relies on controlling the H-infinity norm of the filter. Finally,
   we discuss an application to a privacy-preserving traffic monitoring
   system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of minimizing the energy consumption of
   IP networks. As traffic demands vary over time, energy savings are
   achieved by adapting traffic routing and node and link sleeping patterns
   while guaranteeing QoS and survivability requirements. Network
   survivability is based on shared protection for single link failures.
   The optimization framework considers a set of time intervals and, to
   guarantee network stability, inter-period limitations are imposed. Both
   exact and heuristic methods are proposed. Results obtained with
   realistic networks operated with flow-based routing protocols show that
   i) up to 60\% of the energy savings can be achieved without negatively
   affecting the network resiliency and that ii) the shared protection
   scheme better exploits backup capacity than the dedicate protection one.}},

Abstract = {{Operating rooms (OR) are considered as one of the most resource

   constraints in order to build schedules which maximize resources
   utilization while minimizing cancellations and overtime. In this work, a
   four steps approach is proposed. First, surgery cases are assigned to a
   given day. Second, they are scheduled according to different strategies,
   which are evaluated through a simulation tool in the third step. If
   needed, feedback and rescheduling occur in the fourth step. Uncertainty
   is taken into consideration implicitly twice. First through the load
   level of the schedule built during the assignment problem and second, in
   the simulation step. Each scheduling strategy is evaluated according to
   different performance criteria. Computational experiments performed on
   sixteen sets of randomly generated data (based on real data provided by
   a large hospital center located in Montreal) are used to compare the
   different strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Image registration is a building block for many applications in computer
   vision and medical imaging. However the current methods are limited when
   large and highly non-local deformations are present. In this paper, we
   introduce a new direct feature matching technique for non-parametric
   image registration where efficient nearest-neighbor searches find global
   correspondences between intensity, spatial and geometric information. We
   exploit graph spectral representations that are invariant to isometry
   under complex deformations. Our direct feature matching technique is
   used within the established Demons framework for diffeomorphic image
   registration. Our method, called Spectral Demons, can capture very
   large, complex and highly non-local deformations between images. We
   evaluate the improvements of our method on 2D and 3D images and
   demonstrate substantial improvement over the conventional Demons
   algorithm for large deformations.}},

   show that an interferometric method to monitor the metabolic activity of

   properties of substances than conventional methods. The susceptibility
   of Mycobacterium bovis to hexane extract of Pterodon emarginatus and to
   the well-known antibiotic rifampicin was tested with the interferometric
   method and with the conventional microplate method. The microplate
   method revealed a potential activity of hexane extract against M. bovis.
   However, the interferometric method showed that the action of this
   substance is rather limited. Also in the case of rifampicin, the
   interferometric method was able to detect resistant bacteria.}},

Abstract = {{Photo-induced chemical vapor deposition (photoCVD), referred to as UV
   polymerization under certain conditions, shows promise as a scalable
   method for nanoparticle surface treatment. PhotoCVD does not require the
   use of exotic reagents such as those required by many gas phase reaction
   techniques. Much like plasma, it relies on photon bombardment to form
   radicals from a wide variety of organic precursors, selected on the
   basis of the desired surface properties. Most of the work in the field
   of photoCVD has stemmed from the semi-conductor industry, where the
   focus has been high deposition rates {[}1]. As a result, investigations
   have focused on high cost, short wavelength UV sources for the
   polymerization to take place {[}2]. In the case of nanoparticle
   functionalization for incorporation into other media, coating thickness
   is not a particular concern thus photoCVD can be made readily scalable
   through the use of cheap UV sources. This talk will present an overview
   of scalable gas phase methods and focus on the use of photoCVD for the
   low-cost treatment of nanoparticles required for nanofluid and
   nanocomposite synthesis.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a novel structure and approach of a pure
   surface Plasmon Polariton (SPP) sensor with fiber Bragg gratings (FBG)
   in gold coated specially designed H-cross-section fiber. We evaluate its
   potential for biological sensing applications of the surrounding
   refractive index (SRI). Pure SPP has almost all its field concentration
   at the metal-dielectric interfaces and hence, it is highly sensitive to
   changes in the sensed medium refractive index. This scheme represents an
   ``in-line{''} optical fiber SPP sensor scheme. Also, it provides larger
   and more flexible sensing area along its flat side. Simulation results
   show that the gold layer thickness essentially influences the
   sensitivity, and the shape of the reflection spectrum. Increasing the
   gold layer thickness decreases its sensitivity and broadens the
   spectrum, increasing the FWHM bandwidth. Results show a maximum
   sensitivity of 230 nm/RIU and maximum figure of merit; defined as the
   ratio of sensitivity to FWHM bandwidth of the reflection spectrum; of
   10952 RIU-1 (Sensitivity = 230 nm/RIU and FWHM = 2.1 x 10(-5) mu m) with
   gold thickness of 10 nm. In conclusion, the proposed sensor is highly
   sensitive and free from any moving parts and can be used as bio-chemical
   sensor.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a hybrid-model imaging system combining fluorescence and
   ultrasound (US) was investigated with the motivation of providing
   structural priors towards improvement of fluorescence reconstruction. A
   single element transducer was scanned over the sample for anatomy. In
   the fluorescence part, a laser source was scanned over the sample with
   the emission received by an EMCCD camera. Synchronization was achieved
   by a pair of motorized linear stages. Structural information was derived
   from the US images and a profilometry and used to constrain
   reconstruction. In the reconstruction, we employed a GPU-based Monte
   Carlo simulation for forward modeling and a pattern-based method to take
   advantage of the huge dataset for the inverse problem. Performance of
   this system was validated with two phantoms with fluorophore inclusions.
   The results indicated that the fluorophore distribution could be
   accurately reconstructed. And the system has a potential for the future
   in-vivo study.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical schemes for laser cooling with nanoparticles have been
   presented and comprehensively investigated. It is shown that specially
   designed samples based on nanoparticles can be used to improve the
   process of laser cooling of solids. One of the proposed schemes is based
   on lead salt colloidal quantum dots (QDs) doped in a glass host. The
   second one is based on Tm3+ doped oxy fluoride glass ceramic. It has
   been shown that lead salt colloidal QDs doped in a glass host can
   operate as artificial atoms. Very short (microsecond range) radiative
   lifetimes of the excited 1Sh level of PbSe QDs in comparison with the
   relatively long (millisecond) radiative lifetime of rare-earth (RE) ions
   allows the cooling process to be accelerated and to use new hosts with
   relatively high maximum phonon energy, which have so far been considered
   not suitable for cooling with RE ions. It has been shown that the second
   sample, which is based on Tm3+ doped oxy fluoride glass ceramic provides
   the unique combination of high chemical and mechanical stability of the
   oxide glass, which is important for a number of applications, and the
   low phonon energy of the fluoride nano-crystals, which trap a majority
   of Tm3+ ions participating in the cooling process. This is highly
   beneficial for laser cooling of solids, since the effective embedding of
   rare-earth ions in the crystalline phase with low phonon energy provides
   a high quantum efficiency for the F-3(4) -> H-3(6) transition involved
   in the cooling cycle in the Tm3+ ions, which is a key parameter for
   laser cooling of solids.}},

Abstract = {{The hemodynamic responses to 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) induced focal
   epileptic spikes and electrical stimulations are compared in a rat
   model. Nonlinearities are quantified with biophysical models.
   Supranormal oxygen consumption from epileptic spikes is inferred. In one
   recording, interictal spikes followed an almost periodic pattern. Such
   rhythmic spiking is a well-documented phenomenon in electrophysiological
   studies, but the hemodynamics correlates have been less studied. Spikes
   occurred every 12.5 +/- 1.0 s. Peaks in total hemoglobin (HbT), a proxy
   for regional cerebral blood volume, followed spikes by 2.6 +/- 0.3 s.
   Troughs in HbT preceded spikes by 1.68 +/- 1.2 s. The narrowness of this
   distribution is surprising. From it, one may derive a significant but
   paradoxical fall in HbT several seconds before the spikes, but which
   this decrease in HbT is better interpreted as being due to the
   interictal spike that occurred before.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an attribute based access control (ABAC)
   approach for safely sharing knowledge in a collaborative environment.
   Indeed, existing similar systems facilitate collaboration at the risk to
   convey doubtful information and sometimes serve as a gate to vandalism.
   Our system called ``WiseShare{''} ensures collaboration while focusing
   on the reliability of the broadcasted content. To achieve this goal, we
   precisely express the requirements needed to control the shared
   information. In addition, we define a formal framework for specifying
   security policies governing contributions requests according to user
   profile. We present also a prototype implementing the functionalities of
   our system. In our approach, a new user has limited rights. On an
   ongoing basis, if he demonstrates his ability to produce good
   contributions, he gains new privileges. Conversely, if he often
   generates contributions with a questionable content, he loses the held
   privileges. Therefore, granting user requests depends closely on his
   previous behavior (the history). Indeed, our system encourages users to
   adopt a responsible attitude by focusing on the reliability of the
   content of their contributions instead of their frequency. Consequently,
   WiseShare permits to significantly minimize clumsy and malicious
   actions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a formalization of the complementary information
   structures approach, which was originally derived from the practical
   implementation of a Manufacturing Process Management solution. The
   Environment-based Design methodology has been chosen to generalize the
   Manufacturing Process Management experience and the resulting
   theoretical foundations are then used to propose a complementary
   information framework between customer needs and product descriptions.
   The definition of the relationships between the structures is derived
   from the ``customer job mapping{''} approach used in Outcome Driven
   Innovation marketing techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Capturing users' needs is critical in web site design. However, a lot of
   attention has been paid to enhance the functionality and usability,
   whereas much less consideration has been given to satisfy the emotional
   needs of users, which is also important to a successful design. This
   paper explores a methodology based on Kansei Engineering, which was
   significant used in product and industrial design but not quite been
   adopted in the IT field, in order to discover implicit emotional needs
   of users toward web site and transform them into design details. Survey,
   interview techniques and statistical methods were performed in this
   paper. A prototype web site was developed based on the Kansei study
   results integrated with technical expertise and practical
   considerations. The results showed that the Kansei Engineering
   methodology, in this paper, played a significant role in web site design
   in terms of satisfying the emotional needs of users.}},

Abstract = {{Dry low emissions premixed combustion systems have the ability to give
   larger NOx emissions reduction in comparison to diffusion type of
   combustors. However, these systems are prone to flashback because the
   fuel and oxidizers are mixed upstream of the combustion chamber. This is
   particularly true for premixed systems burning high-reactivity fuels due
   to their higher flame speed. Flashback is undesirable in gas turbines
   because it leads to overheating and failure of fuel nozzles and
   premixing sections. Recently, a novel application of Plasma Actuation
   through non-thermal Dielectric Barrier Discharge has been shown to
   significantly delay flashback in the core flow along the axis of the
   premixer. Building on this successful endeavour, efforts were directed
   to prove the effectiveness of the control method in situations where
   flashback was triggered in the boundary layer. Results show that the
   current application delays the occurrence of flashback in the boundary
   layer of the premixer to higher equivalence ratios. Improvements in the
   combustor operability margin of 10 to 14\% when burning natural gas-air
   mixtures, and of about 3.5\% when replacing the fuel by an equimolar
   mixture of natural gas and hydrogen, were achieved. It was found that
   the proposed application of plasma actuation is even more efficient in
   preventing flashback in the boundary layer than in the core flow.}},

Abstract = {{A prototype results from the need to verify various qualities of the
   product at different stages of its development. In set-based design,
   multiplying prototypes is particularly critical to enable a broad
   exploration of the design space before committing to a solution. The
   exploration targets the choice of the best of all viable concepts on one
   hand but on the other hand also focuses on documenting them to better
   orient the search during the next attempts. This ultimately contributes
   to gradually improving the company's engineering knowledge. According to
   current aerospace industry practices and considering the set based
   development paradigm in Lean thinking, an approach to handle multiple
   prototypes information with Digital Mock-Up (DMU) technologies is
   forwarded in this paper. This approach postulates that prototyping and
   testing activities may be supported by a Manufacturing Process
   Management (MPM) solution with a special use of three key
   functionalities, namely: Product Data Management (PDM) and MPM
   instantiation, MPM links, and Configuration Management (CM). These
   aspects are essential when handling multiple prototyping sets along with
   their test results.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with two major issues for industries: the product
   design and the supply chain design. These problems are usually solved
   separately, but in recent years, approaches were proposed to tackle
   these two problems together. In this paper, we investigate more
   precisely the links between the standardization of products or
   components, and the design of the supply chain. First, we show on a
   little example that there is a great interest to consider simultaneously
   these two decisions, and that solving these interdependent problems
   separately could result in a suboptimal, or even a bad, decision. Then,
   on a simplified problem issued from an industrial case study, we outline
   the impact of standardization choices on the structure of the supply
   chain and the gain that can be obtained from solving the problem as a
   unique compound optimization model. To illustrate the solutions of the
   problem, we propose graphics in order to visualize, in function of
   quantities and/or transportation costs, the hest decision for the
   product standardization and for the supply chain design. Graphics also
   permit to anticipate the impacts of a variation of either quantities or
   transportation costs, from a specific situation. Such graphics they
   could be used in a decision aid tool to help companies in their choices.
   Finally, we show that costs and supply chain structure are highly
   impacted. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},
