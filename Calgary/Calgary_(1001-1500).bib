Abstract = {{Forest fire is a natural phenomenon in many ecosystems across the world.
   One of the most important components of forest fire management is the
   forecasting of fire danger conditions. Here, our aim was to critically
   analyse the following issues, (i) current operational forest fire danger
   forecasting systems and their limitations; (ii) remote sensing-based
   fire danger monitoring systems and usefulness in operational
   perspective; (iii) remote sensing-based fire danger forecasting systems
   and their functional implications; and (iv) synergy between operational
   forecasting systems and remote sensing-based methods. In general, the
   operational systems use point-based measurements of meteorological
   variables (e.g., temperature, wind speed and direction, relative
   humidity, precipitations, cloudiness, solar radiation, etc.) and
   generate danger maps upon employing interpolation techniques.
   Theoretically, it is possible to overcome the uncertainty associated
   with the interpolation techniques by using remote sensing data. During
   the last several decades, efforts were given to develop fire danger
   condition systems, which could be broadly classified into two major
   groups: fire danger monitoring and forecasting systems. Most of the
   monitoring systems focused on determining the danger during and/or after
   the period of image acquisition. A limited number of studies were
   conducted to forecast fire danger conditions, which could be adaptable.
   Synergy between the operational systems and remote sensing-based methods
   were investigated in the past but too much complex in nature. Thus, the
   elaborated understanding about these developments would be worthwhile to
   advance research in the area of fire danger in the context of making
   them operational. (c) 2014 International Society for Photogrammetiy and

Title = {{Using patient flow simulation to improve access at a multidisciplinary

Abstract = {{The lack of timely access to diagnosis and treatment for sleep disorders
   is well described, but little attention has been paid to understanding
   how multiple system constraints contribute to long waiting times. The
   objectives of this study were to identify system constraints leading to
   long waiting times at a multidisciplinary sleep centre, and to use
   patient flow simulation modelling to test solutions that could improve
   access. Discrete-event simulation models of patient flow were
   constructed using historical data from 150 patients referred to the
   sleep centre, and used to both examine reasons for access delays and to
   test alternative system configurations that were predicted by
   administrators to reduce waiting times. Four possible solutions were
   modelled and compared with baseline, including addition of capacity to
   different areas at the sleep centre and elimination of prioritization by
   urgency. Within the model, adding physician capacity improved time from
   patient referral to initial physician appointment, but worsened time
   from polysomnography requisition to test completion, and had no effect
   on time from patient referral to treatment initiation. Adding
   respiratory therapist did not improve model performance compared with
   baseline. Eliminating triage prioritization worsened time to physician
   assessment and treatment initiation for urgent patients without
   improving waiting times overall. This study demonstrates that
   discrete-event simulation can identify multiple constraints in
   access-limited healthcare systems and allow suggested solutions to be
   tested before implementation. The model of this sleep centre predicted
   that investments in capacity expansion proposed by administrators would
   not reduce the time to a clinically meaningful patient outcome.}},

Abstract = {{Electrical conductive nanostructures made of nanofibers of poly (amide
   6) (PA6) with carboxyl functionalized multiwall carbon nanotubes
   (MWCNTCOOH) and anchored MWCNTCOOH were produced. The nanotubes were
   surface activated with carboxyl groups, dispersed in formic acid and
   added to a formic acid solution of PA6. The mixture was electrospun by
   applying a voltage of 30 kV; afterwards, the nanofiber's mats were
   immersed in an aqueous dispersion of MWCNTCOOH containing a nonionic
   surfactant. The chemical structure, morphology, thermal stability, and
   electrical conductivity of the nanostructures were evaluated by UV
   spectroscopy, scanning (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM), thermal gravimetric analyses (TGA) and volumetric conductivity
   measurements. The efficiency of the functionalization was confirmed by
   the UV peaks in the range between 220 and 250 nm (corresponding to a
   carbonyl group conjugated with a carbon-carbon double bond). SEM and TEM
   micrographs showed the pullout of the MWCNTCOOH from the nanofibers and
   the formation of a stable, percolated, and anchored MWCNTCOOH network on
   the nanofibers due to the anchoring of the MWCNTCOOH from the surfactant
   solution on the MWCNTCOOH of the nanofibers. The coated nanostructures
   had higher thermal stability and higher electrical conductivity than the
   noncoated ones, showing the efficiency of this simple procedure. POLYM.

Abstract = {{The elasticity tensor providing the power-conjugation of the
   Green-Naghdi rate of the Kirchhoff stress and the deformation rate is
   required, e.g. by the commercially available Finite Element package
   ABAQUS/Standard for the material user subroutine UMAT, used to input
   material behaviours other than those included in the libraries of the
   package. This elasticity tensor had been studied in the literature, but
   its symmetries have only been briefly discussed, and only its component
   form in Cartesian coordinates was known. In this work, we derived a
   covariant, component-free expression of this elasticity tensor and
   thoroughly studied its symmetries. We found that, although symmetry on
   both pair of feet (indices) has been deemed to be desirable in the
   literature, the expression of the tensor available to-date in fact
   possesses only symmetry on the first pair of feet (indices), whereas the
   second pair lacks symmetry, and therefore carries a skew-symmetric
   contribution. This contribution is unnecessary, as it is automatically
   filtered in the contraction of the elasticity tensor with the symmetric
   deformation rate tensor. In order to avoid carrying this unnecessary
   skew-symmetric contribution in the computations, we employ a tensor
   identity that naturally symmetrises the second pair of feet of the
   elasticity tensor. We demonstrated the validity and robustness of the
   implementation of the user-defined material based on this tensor
   representation by simulating a benchmark problem consisting in biaxial
   tests of porcine and human atrial tissue, with material properties taken
   from previously performed experiments. We compared the results obtained
   by means of our user-defined material and those obtained through an
   equivalent built-in material, and obtained identical results.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIPHASE FLOW}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{73-82}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{We report a systematic simulation of immiscible fluid-fluid
   displacements in the presence of phase change (condensation). To track
   the leading interface position, two highly accurate methods including
   Level Set and Immersed Interface Method were used, while for locating
   the trailing interface an energy equation was adopted assuming the
   existence of a uniform thin condensate layer. Numerical results revealed
   significant effects of the capillary (Ca) and Jacob (Ja) numbers as well
   as the viscosity ratios of the three phases on the development of the
   instability and the interfacial morphology of the finger structures.
   Increasing Ca or the viscosity ratio tends to amplify the interfacial
   instability, fingertip splitting, and results in longer fingers. In
   contrast, increasing Ja has stabilizing effects. As condensation takes
   place at the steam-condensation interface, it results in opposing
   effects to the destabilizing hydrodynamic forces and hence attenuates
   their role in the growth of the instability. This effect is found to be
   strong at small Ca and viscosity ratios and at large Ja. Produced
   accumulated condensate and oil saturation depletion curves during the
   injection process show increasing and decreasing trends, respectively,
   when Ca increases. Similar trends for the variation of the accumulated
   condensate with the viscosity ratio and Ja were found. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The diffusion coefficient of natural gas in foamy oil is one of the key
   parameters to evaluate the feasibility of gas injection for enhanced oil
   recovery in foamy oil reservoirs. In this paper, a PVT cell was used to
   measure diffusion coefficients of natural gas in Venezuela foamy oil at
   high pressures, and a new method for determining the diffusion
   coefficient in the foamy oil was developed on the basis of experimental
   data. The effects of pressure and the types of the liquid phase on the
   diffusion coefficient of the natural gas were discussed. The results
   indicate that the diffusion coefficients of natural gas in foamy oil,
   saturated oil, and dead oil increase linearly with increasing pressure.
   The diffusion coefficient of natural gas in the foamy oil at 20 MPa was
   2.93 times larger than that at 8.65 MPa. The diffusion coefficient of
   the natural gas in dead oil was 3.02 and 4.02 times than that of the
   natural gas in saturated oil and foamy oil when the pressure was 20 MPa.
   However, the gas content of foamy oil was 16.9 times higher than that of
   dead oil when the dissolution time and pressure were 20 MPa and 35.22 h,

Abstract = {{We document vertical permeability of (2.3 nd) and horizontal
   permeability of (96.3 nd) in two Barnett Shale samples. The samples are
   composed predominantly of quartz, calcite, and clay; have a porosity and
   a total organic content of 4 \% each; and have a thermal maturity of 1.9
   \% vitrinite reflectance. Both samples exhibit stress-dependent
   permeability when the confining pressure is increased from 10.3 to 41.4
   MPa. We measure a permeability anisotropy, the ratio of the horizontal
   to the vertical permeability, of 40. We find that the permeability
   anisotropy does not vary with effective stress. Multiscale permeability,
   as demonstrated by pressure dissipation, is related to millimeter-scale
   stratigraphic variation. We attribute the permeability anisotropy to
   preferential flow along more permeable layers and attribute the stress
   dependence to pore closure. A determination of permeability anisotropy
   allows us to understand flow properties in horizontal and vertical
   directions and assists our understanding of upscaling. Characterization
   of stress dependency allows us to predict permeability evolution during
   production.}},

Abstract = {{As an example of nanoporous carbon materials, colloid-imprinted carbons
   (CICs) have been reported to have promising properties for use in a
   variety of applications. However, the wettability of these carbons has
   not been investigated as yet. In this work, CICs with different pore
   sizes (20-50 nm) were synthesized and heat treated at 1500 degrees C
   under a N-2 atmosphere. Heat treatment was found to not alter the
   nanoporous structure of these carbons, but did significantly decrease
   their oxygen content. Contact angle kinetics (CAK) and water vapor
   sorption (WVS) experiments were carried out to determine the wettability
   of the CICs, before and after heat treatment, showing that the
   as-synthesized CICs surfaces are much more hydrophilic when compared to
   commercial carbon black (Vulcan carbon, VC). The high hydrophilicity of
   the CICs is likely due to their high surface-specific oxygen atomic
   density (similar to 10 mu mol m(-2)). Further heat treatment
   significantly decreases the hydrophilicity of CICs because of the
   removal of oxygen atoms from their surfaces, as also reflected by their
   cyclic voltammetric response in acidic solutions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Measuring and modeling the magnetic settling of superparamagnetic

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present settling experiments and mathematical modeling
   to study the magnetic separation of superparamagnetic iron-oxide
   nanoparticles (SPIONs) from a brine. The experiments were performed
   using SPIONs suspensions of concentration between 3 and 202 g/L
   dispersed in water and separated from the liquid under the effect of a
   permanent magnet. A 1D model was developed in the framework of the
   sedimentation theory with a conservation law for SPIONs and a mass flux
   function based on the Newton's law for motion in a magnetic field. The
   model describes both the hindering effect of suspension concentration
   (n) during settling due to particle collisions and the increase in
   settling rate due to the attraction of the SPIONs towards the magnet.
   The flux function was derived from the settling experiments and the
   numerical model validated against the analytical solution and the
   experimental data. Suspensions of SPIONs were of 2.8 cm initial height,
   placed on a magnet, and monitored continuously with a digital camera.
   Applying a magnetic field of 0.5 T of polarization, the SPION's velocity
   was of approximately 3 . 10(-5) m/s close to the magnet and decreases of
   two orders of magnitude across the domain. The process was characterized
   initially by a classical sedimentation behavior, i.e., an upper
   interface between the clear water and the suspension slowly moving
   towards the magnet and a lower interface between the sediment layer and
   the suspension moving away from the magnet. Subsequently, a rapid
   separation of nanoparticle occured suggesting a non-classical settling
   phenomenon induced by magnetic forces which favor particle aggregation
   and therefore faster settling. The rate of settling decreased with n and
   an optimal condition for fast separation was found for an initial n of
   120 g/L. The model agrees well with the measurements in the early stage
   of the settling, but it fails to describe the upper interface movement
   during the later stage, probably because of particle aggregation induced
   by magnetization which is not accounted for in the model. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{TerraSAR-X satellite acquires very high spatial resolution data with
   potential for detailed land cover mapping. A known problem with
   synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is the lack of spectral information.
   Fusion of SAR and multispectral data provides opportunities for better

   was to investigate the fusion between TerraSAR-X and Landsat ETM+ for
   protected area mapping using high pass filtering (HPF), principal
   component analysis with band substitution (PCA) and principal component
   with wavelet transform (WPCA). A total of thirteen land cover classes
   were identified for classification using a non-parametric C 4.5 decision
   tree classifier. Overall classification accuracies of 74.99\%, 83.12\%
   and 85.38\% and kappa indices of 0.7220, 0.8100 and 0.8369 were obtained
   for HPF, PCA and WPCA fusion approaches respectively. These results
   indicate a high potential for a combined use of TerraSAR-X and Landsat

   Estimation for Rainfall Monitoring and Forecasting}},

Abstract = {{GPS-based precipitable water vapor (PWV) estimation has been proven as a
   cost-effective approach for numerical weather prediction. Most previous
   efforts focus on the performance evaluation of post-processed
   GPS-derived PWV estimates using International GNSS Service (IGS)
   satellite products with at least 3-9-h latency. However, the suggested
   timeliness for meteorological nowcasting is 5-30 min. Therefore, the
   latency has limited the GPS-based PWV estimation in real-time
   meteorological nowcasting. The limitation has been overcome since April
   2013 when IGS released real-time GPS orbit and clock products. This
   becomes the focus of this paper, which investigates real-time GPS
   precise point positioning (PPP)-based PWV estimation and its potential
   for rainfall monitoring and forecasting. This paper first evaluates the
   accuracy of IGS CLK90 real-time orbit and clock products.
   Root-mean-square (RMS) errors of < 5 cm and similar to 0.6 ns are
   revealed for real-time orbit and clock products, respectively, during
   July 4-10, 2013. Second, the real-time GPS PPP-derived PWV values
   obtained at IGS station WUHN are compared with the post-processed
   counterparts. The RMS difference of 2.4 mm has been identified with a
   correlation coefficient of 0.99. Third, two case studies, including a
   severe rainfall event and a series of moderate rainfall events, have
   been presented. The agreement between the real-time GPS PPP-derived PWV
   and ground rainfall records indicates the feasibility of real-time GPS
   PPP-derived PWV for rainfall monitoring. Moreover, the significantly
   reduced latency demonstrates a promising perspective of real-time GPS
   PPP-based PWV estimation as an enhancement to existing forecasting
   systems for rainfall forecasting.}},

Abstract = {{Fountain codes were introduced to provide high reliability and
   scalability and low complexities for networks such as the Internet.
   Luby-transform (LT) codes, which are the first realisation of Fountain
   codes, achieve the capacity of the binary erasure channel (BEC)
   asymptotically and universally. Most previous work on single-layer
   Fountain coding targets the design via the right degree distribution.
   The left degree distribution of an LT code is left as a Poisson to
   protect the universality. For finite lengths, this is no longer an
   issue; thus, the author's focus is on designing better codes for the BEC
   at practical lengths. Their left degree shaping provides codes
   outperforming LT codes and all other competing schemes in the
   literature. At a bit error rate of 10(-7) and packet length k = 256,
   their scheme provides a realised rate of 0.6 which is 23.5\% higher than
   that of Sorensen et al.'s decreasing-ripple-size scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Dispersion properties of Rayleigh-type surface waves are widely used in
   environmental and engineering geophysics to image and characterize a
   shallow subsurface. In this paper, we numerically study the
   Rayleigh-type surface waves and their properties in 2D viscoelastic
   media. A finite difference method in a time-space domain is proposed,
   with an unsplit convolutional perfectly matched layer (C-PML) absorbing
   boundary condition. For two models that have analytical expressions of
   wave fields/dispersion curves, we calculate their wave fields and
   compare the analytical and numerical solutions to demonstrate the
   validity of this method. For the case where a medium has a high
   Poisson's ratio, say 0.49, traditional finite difference methods with a
   PML boundary condition are not stable when modeling Rayleigh waves but
   the proposed method is stable. For a laterally heterogeneous
   viscoelastic media model (Model 1) and a two-layer viscoelastic media
   model (Model 2) with a cavity, we use this method to obtain their
   corresponding Rayleigh waves. For several quality factors, the
   dispersion properties of these Rayleigh waves are analyzed. The results
   of Model 1 show that in a shallow subsurface, the phase velocity of a
   fundamental mode of the Rayleigh waves increases considerably with a
   quality factor Q decreasing; the phase velocity increases with Poisson's
   ratio increasing. The results of Model 2 indicate that the energy of
   higher modes of the Rayleigh waves become strong when Q decreases.}},

Abstract = {{A conceptually simple and powerful method to reduce CO2 emissions from
   Alberta oil sands operations by decarbonizing natural gas (NG) fuel
   prior to combustion is proposed, thus removing carbon from the process
   up front. The natural gas decarbonization (NGD) process can be
   integrated with either in situ bitumen recovery or upgrading processes
   or both. The process generates hydrogen and carbon black, a stable
   marketable form of carbon. Decarbonizing the NG fuel to hydrogen reduces
   downstream CO2 emissions and obviates the requirement for CO2
   sequestration since the carbon is stored in a solid form. The hydrogen
   can be used as either a fuel for steam generation or for hydrotreating.
   In addition, steam is generated from the hydrogen combustion reaction
   itself. A near-zero emissions process is achievable by using the
   hydrogen generated as the fuel for decarbonization. We used process
   modeling to assess the performance of hydrogen production and steam
   generation using two major process integration concepts: (i) Oxy-NG
   combustion integrated with the NGD process and (ii) Substantially zero
   emissions concept via an autothermal process using hydrogen product as
   the energy source for the process NGD process. Though energy penalties
   are incurred in the decarbonization process, we identify several
   potential practical process options. The proposed technology is
   particularly suitable for heavy oil recovery and upgrading, and fuel
   combustion for power generation. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{382}},
Pages = {{124-133}},

Abstract = {{The coercivity and hysteresis losses of non oriented electrical steels
   (NOES) are determined by metallurgical parameters evolved during their
   manufacturing process. Although the links between grain size, inclusion
   content, orientation and these magnetic properties are well established,
   the effects of misorientation, especially with respect to the magnetic
   easy axis, are mostly unexplored. From this work examining NOES samples
   with ``typical{''} grain size and inclusion distributions, but with
   texture variations induced by lab processing, the major factors
   determining the coercivity and hysteresis losses were limited to the
   magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (E-a) and LAM, a newly created easy
   axis misorientation parameter, It is believed that E-a is a measure of
   the contribution of domain rotation processes, while EAM is a
   representation of the ability of the sample to nucleate reverse magnetic
   domains. The utilization of EAM allows for a better understanding of the
   influence of metallurgical parameters on the magnetic properties,
   especially for samples with large differences in processing and texture.

Title = {{Kinetic study of coal steam and CO2 gasification: A new method to reduce
   interparticle diffusion}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{148}},
Pages = {{160-167}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{The effect of coal bed thickness was studied and compared between steam
   and CO2 gasification. Despite using small amounts of coal sample, both
   gasifying agents' kinetics, i.e., steam and CO2, proved to be affected
   by bulk and interparticle diffusion. Comparison between the gasifying
   agents indicates that mass transfer effects are minimized when the raw
   material layer and particle size are smaller than 0.14 mm and 90 mu m,
   respectively.
   In addition to mass transfer limitations, studies have confirmed that
   the reported maximum reaction rate is a consequence of the gas switching
   between inert and reaction gas during steam gasification; therefore, the
   time to replace the reaction medium cannot be considered as part of the
   kinetic analysis or taken into account in the kinetic model that
   represents the reaction mechanism. Nevertheless, it is not appropriate
   to use steam alone during pyrolysis and gasification in kinetic studies,
   since these two reactions overlap in the same temperature reaction
   range. An alternative method to overcoming these restrictions is
   proposed in this study.
   The present study demonstrates a consistent method to perform
   gasification in the chemically controlled temperature range between 750
   degrees C and 900 degrees C. In addition, the apparent activation energy
   is estimated independent of the kinetic model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The effects of different inorganic cations (Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Al3+) on

   enhances the apparent viscosity and viscoelasticity of xanthan and

Title = {{Effect of flow mechanism with multi-nonlinearity on production of shale
   gas}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Pages = {{291-301}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Different from oil reservoirs, variations of gas properties (such as
   viscosity, Z-factor and gas compressibility) under different pressures
   is strongly nonlinear and non-Darcy effect is significant in fractures
   due to high rate. Shale gas reservoirs are extremely tight with
   nanopores, where Darcy's law breaks down and the flow behavior is
   significantly influenced by pore scale and pressure. 20\%-80\% of the
   shale gas in place (in-situ) is adsorbed to organic matters and the
   desorption is a nonlinear process varying with pressure. Furthermore,
   hydraulic fractures and natural fractures close gradually, as the
   production proceeds, resulting in a non-linear relationship between
   permeability and pressure. However, the multinonlinear flow mechanism,
   as well as its effect on gas production, in the process of shale gas
   development is always overlooked by both laboratories and industrial
   analyses.
   Based on the five-region model, finite difference method is applied to
   get numerical solution in this paper. Afterwards, the effect of
   nonlinear mechanism on production is analyzed, according to which, the
   enhanced ultimate recovery (EUR) schemes are proposed. The results show
   that the effects of compressibility, multi-scale flow, stress
   sensitivity and non-Darcy flow in fractures on production are
   significant during early stage and should be considered in well testing
   model. For middle and late production stages, the effects of
   compressibility, multi-scale flow, stress sensitivity in natural
   fractures should be considered in the Rate Transient Analysis (RTA)
   model and long-term production prediction model. The negative effect of
   stress sensitivity and non-Darcy flow can be reduced or mitigated by
   optimizing schedule and controlling early pressure drawdown.
   Furthermore, some nonlinear factors can be used positively by
   refracturing, which reduces formation pressure and consequently leading
   to the increase of gas compressibility, desorption compressibility and
   apparent permeability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Wind-power ramps are a significant source of uncertainty in wind-energy
   forecasting and are a challenge to electric-grid stability. In the
   Canadian province of Alberta, strong westerly winds buffet the Rocky
   Mountains creating an abundant yet intermittent wind energy resource in
   the plains of Alberta. In the current study, wind-power ramp events have
   been detected and correlated to several environmental factors including
   time-of-day, atmospheric stability, season and a Fohn wind event known
   locally as a Chinook wind at a field wind measurement station downstream
   of the Rocky Mountains. Large wind-power ramps (a 50\% change in power
   in less than 4 h) were found to occur on days when a Fohn wind was
   present over 50\% of the time. The result highlights the importance of
   this meteorological phenomenon to wind energy production locally and
   also in regions where Fohn winds occur. The detected wind-power ramps
   were found to vary significantly with season, with the strongest
   wind-power ramps emanating from the Rocky Mountains in the winter months
   under stable atmospheric conditions. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Effect of Fracture Geometry on Well Production in Hydraulic-Fractured
   Tight Oil Reservoirs}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CANADIAN PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{183-194}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Tight oil production is emerging as an important new source of energy
   supply and has reversed a decline in US crude-oil production and western
   Canadian light-oil production. At present, the combination of the
   multistage hydraulic fracturing and horizontal wells has become a widely
   used technology in stimulating tight oil reservoirs. However, the ideal
   planar fractures used in the reservoir simulation are simplified
   excessively. Effects of some key fracture properties (e.g.,
   fracture-geometry distributions and the permeability variations) are not
   usually taken into consideration during the simulation. Oversimplified
   fractures in the reservoir model may fail to represent the complex
   fractures in reality, leading to significant errors in forecasting the
   reservoir performance. In this paper, we examined the different
   fracture-geometry distributions and discussed the effects of geometry
   distribution on well production further. All fracture-geometry scenarios
   were confined by microseismic-mapping data. To make the result more
   reliable and relevant, a geomodel was first constructed for a tight oil
   block in Willesden Green oil field in Alberta, Canada. The simulation
   model was then generated on the basis of the geomodel and history
   matched to the production history of vertical production wells. A
   horizontal well was drilled in the simulation model, and different
   fracture-geometry scenarios were analyzed. Results indicated that the
   simulation results of simple planar fractures overestimated the oil rate
   and led to higher oil recoveries. In addition, if the secondary fracture
   can achieve the same permeability as the main fracture, a hydraulic
   fracture with branches can increase the well production (e.g., Scenario
   2 under the conductivity ratio of 1: 2) because of a larger effective
   contact area between matrix and fracture. Secondary fractures with low
   permeability can decrease the well productivity compared with wells with
   biwing planar fractures. Furthermore, the effect of hydraulic-fracture
   geometries on the cumulative production of the wells with higher
   main-fracture conductivity was more significant compared with those with
   lower main-fracture conductivity.}},

Abstract = {{A correlation was developed to predict the density of mixtures of heavy
   oil (and other petroleum liquids) and hydrocarbon solvents when the
   densities of each fluid in the mixture are available. Densities at
   atmospheric pressure and 293 K were measured for saturates and aromatics
   (SA) fractions from 10 native, thermo-cracked, and hydrocracked heavy
   oils all mixed with toluene and n-heptane; distillation cuts from 6
   heavy oils mixed with toluene; and mixtures of deasphalted heavy oils
   with naphtha, diesel, and condensate. Density of mixtures of
   hydrocarbons and solvents at higher pressures (0.1-10 MPa). and
   temperatures (298-353 K) were also measured or obtained from the
   literature. Symmetry versus mass fraction was observed for all of the
   mixtures, and their densities were fitted with a mixing rule in which
   excess volumes are quantified with a binary interaction parameter and
   the density of each mixture component. The excess volume mixing rule fit
   the data for each mixture with average absolute deviations (AAD) less
   than 1.1 kg/m(3), and the overall average AAD was 0.39 kg/m(3). The
   binary interaction parameter was correlated to the density of the
   components in the mixture and to temperature. Pressure was found to have
   no consistent effect in the interaction parameter and was neglected. The
   overall AAD for the density determined with the torrelated fin for
   binary mixtures was L. kg/m(3) compared with 3.0 kg/m(3) if regular
   solution behavior was assumed and 3.6 kg/m(3) when the standard American
   Petroleum Institute (API) correlation was used to predict the density of
   the mixtures. The API correlation and correlated excess volume mixing
   rule performed similarly for hydrocarbons with carbon numbers above
   five. The proposed correlation was also tested on ternary data from the
   literature with comparable results.}},

Abstract = {{Unconventional oils are very viscous and immobile at reservoir
   conditions; hence, recovery techniques that are used in conventional

   transportation. Thus, in this study, the viscosity of Athabasca bitumen
   and n-hexane mixtures was measured at different temperatures, pressures,
   and solvent weight fractions. The results indicated a huge reduction in
   viscosity of bitumen by increasing the temperature and/or dissolving the
   solvent. The viscosity of the mixtures showed a curvilinear trend with
   respect to the solvent weight fraction and temperature. The impact of
   pressure on the mixture viscosity is more pronounced at lower solvent
   weight fractions and lower temperatures. The evaluation of different
   models for mixture viscosity indicated that the power law and Cragoe's
   models represent the viscosity data over wide range of operating
   conditions better than other models. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Hyaluronic acid (HA), lubricin, and phospholipid species (PLs)
   contribute independently or together to the boundary lubrication of
   articular joints that is provided by synovial fluid (SF). Our study is
   the first reporting quantitative data about the molecular weight (MW)
   forms of HA, lubricin, and PLs in SF from cohorts of healthy donors,
   patients with early (eOA)- or late (lOA)-stage osteoarthritis (OA), and
   patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
   Methods
   We used human SF from unaffected controls, eOA, lOA, and RA. HA and
   lubricin levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. PLs
   was quantified by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry.
   Fatty acids (FAs) were analyzed by gas chromatography, coupled with mass
   spectrometry. The MW distribution of HA was determined by agarose gel
   electrophoresis.
   Results
   Compared with control SF, the concentrations of HA and lubricin were
   lower in OA and RA SF, whereas those of PLs were higher in OA and RA SF.
   Moreover, the MW distribution of HA shifted toward the lower ranges in
   OA and RA SF. We noted distinct alterations between cohorts in the
   relative distribution of PLs and the degree of FA saturation and chain
   lengths of FAs.
   Conclusions
   The levels, composition, and MW distribution of all currently known
   lubricants in SF-HA, lubricin, PLs-vary with joint disease and stage of
   OA. Our study is the first delivering a comprehensive view about all
   joint lubricants during health and widespread joint diseases. Thus, we
   provide the framework to develop new optimal compounded lubricants to
   reduce joint destruction.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a radially-pruned multidimensional Volterra model
   for the modeling and linearization of concurrent dual-band transmitters.
   The proposed model accounts for the impact of cross-band intermodulation
   distortions of the dual-band power amplifier (PA) and also the effect of
   quadrature modulator (QM) imperfections. The performance of the proposed
   model is validated using a broadband class AB PA driven concurrently by
   two independent LTE signals at a separation frequency of around 60 MHz,
   in the presence of in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) modulator imperfections.
   The measurement results validate the accurate linearization performance
   of the proposed model in suppressing the adjacent channel power (ACP),
   as well as the QM impairments, as compared to other state-of-the-art
   models.}},

Abstract = {{A chaotic mixer is developed and optimized in order to overcome
   challenges associated with mixing polymers with high aspect ratio
   nano-particulates. The chaotic mixing system utilizes two cylindrical
   rotors to uniformly mix multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with a
   thermoplastic. Results of the electrical conductivity and
   electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding effectiveness of the
   chaotic mixed nanocomposites were higher than ones mixed via a
   commercial HAAKE mixer. MWCNTs' length was investigated and it was
   observed that the MWCNTs in chaotic mixed nanocomposites are longer
   compared to HAAKE mixer. To investigate the effects of MWCNTs' length on
   the electrical properties, a 3D electrical model based on random walk
   method was developed and examined. Obtained results suggest that the
   chaotic mixer has a higher potential for mixing nano particulates into
   thermoplastics without breaking the nanotubes and improved electrical
   properties, compared to other types of melt mixing techniques.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This work is aimed at emphasising the relationship between metric and
   deformation, under the light of a novel formalism for the Polar
   Decomposition Theorem. All results are first presented in the classical
   formalism of Cauchy's celebrated theorem, and then in the proposed
   alternative formalism. Although the latter requires a little more work
   to be established, it allows for directly defining all strain tensors as
   covariant, i.e. with both feet being covectors. Emphasis is also placed
   on how, in the absence of the metric structure, the available
   mathematical tools are restricted to the deformation gradient alone.
   Along with these main results, and in the didactical intention that
   permeates this work, several hints are given, which could be useful in
   teaching Continuum Mechanics, e.g. the rigorous definition of the
   determinant of the deformation gradient in Riemannian manifolds, and a
   caveat on the definition of the spatial Hencky logarithmic strain. The
   setting is that of modern Continuum Mechanics, based on the description
   given by Differential Geometry in terms of differentiable manifolds.
   However, passing to the simpler case of affine spaces takes almost no
   effort, paying attention to keeping the distinction between vectors and
   covectors, and therefore allowing the matrices representing the metric
   tensors to differ from the unit matrix.}},

Abstract = {{Short initial settling time and rapidly increased ammonium nitrogen
   loading were employed to cultivate nitrifying granular sludge treating
   inorganic wastewater with 1000 mg/L ammonium nitrogen. It was found that
   the nitrifying granule-dominant sludge was formed in a sequencing batch
   reactor (SBR) with influent ammonium concentration increased from 200 to
   1000 mg N/L within 55 days. During the following 155-day operation
   period, nitrifying granules exhibited good performance with an ammonium
   removal efficiency of 99 \%. In the meantime, sludge volume index (SVI)
   decreased from 92 to 15 mL/g and the mean size of the nitrifying
   granules increased from 106 to 369 mu m. Mixed liquor suspended solids
   (MLSS) decreased from the initial 6.4 to around 3 g/L during the
   granulation period and increased to over 10 g/L at the end of the
   operation. The long-term stability of nitrifying granules and the
   reactor performance were not negatively affected by inhibition from free
   ammonia (FA) and free nitrous acid (FNA) in this study. This makes the
   granule sludge technology promising in treating high-strength ammonium

Abstract = {{Fracture nonunions represent one of many large bone defects where
   current treatment strategies fall short in restoring both form and
   function of the injured tissue. In this case, the use of a
   tissue-engineered scaffold for promoting bone healing offers an
   accessible and easy-to-manipulate environment for studying bone
   formation processes in vitro. We have previously shown that mechanical
   prestimulation using confined compression of differentiating osteoblasts
   results in an increase in mineralization formed in a 3D collagen-I
   scaffold. This study builds on this knowledge by evaluating the short
   and long-term effects of blocking gap junction-mediated intercellular
   communication among osteogenic cells on their effectiveness to
   mineralize collagen-I scaffolds in vitro, and in the presence and
   absence of mechanical stimulation. In this study, confined compression
   was applied in conjunction with octanol (a general communication
   blocker) or 18-alpha-glycerrhetinic acid (AGA, a specific gap junction
   blocker) using a modified FlexCell plate to collagen-I scaffolds seeded
   with murine embryonic stem cells stimulated toward osteoblast
   differentiation using beta-glycerol phosphate. The activity, presence,
   and expression of osteoblast cadherin, connexin-43, as well as various
   pluripotent and osteogenic markers were examined at 5-30 days of
   differentiation. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching,
   immunofluorescence, viability, histology assessments, and
   reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assessments revealed
   that inhibiting communication in this scaffold altered the lineage and
   function of differentiating osteoblasts. In particular, treatment with
   communication inhibitors caused reduced mineralization in the matrix,
   and dissociation between connexin-43 and integrin alpha 5 beta 1. This
   dissociation was not restored even after long-term recovery. Thus, in
   order for this scaffold to be considered as an alternative strategy for
   the repair of large bone defects, cell-cell contacts and cell-matrix
   interactions must remain intact for osteoblast differentiation and
   function to be preserved. This study shows that within this 3D scaffold,
   gap junctions are essential in osteoblast response to mechanical
   loading, and are essential structures in producing a significant amount
   and organization of mineralization in the matrix.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the effects of alternating current (AC) interference on
   coating disbondment on X65 pipeline steel and the cathodic protection
   (CP) permeation into the disbonding crevice were investigated. Cathodic
   disbondment tests showed that the AC is able to promote disbonding of
   coating from the steel, which is attributed to the solution alkalisation
   by the enhanced cathodic reduction reaction and generation of hydroxyl
   ions. In the absence and presence of AC, CP can be shielded by the
   geometry of coating disbondment. At small AC current densities, such as
   100 A m(-2), the AC results in an enhancement of permeation of CP
   current into the crevice. However, with the increase in AC current
   density, corrosion product generates and deposits in the solution,
   blocking the ionic diffusion and CP permeation. When the AC current
   density is up to 500 A m(-2), the CP is blocked completely to reach the
   disbonding crevice.}},

Abstract = {{Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common among patients with chronic
   kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Home sleep
   testing is used to diagnose OSA in many studies investigating
   sleep-disordered breathing in this population. However, failure to
   successfully complete the test is a significant source of participant
   exclusion from research studies and delayed diagnosis in clinical
   practice. The objective of the study was to identify potential factors
   impeding acceptance and successful completion of home sleep testing in
   patients with kidney disease.
   Four hundred and nineteen patients were recruited from nephrology
   clinics and dialysis units. Following completion of a sleep and medical
   history questionnaire, all patients were invited to perform a single
   night, home sleep study. Acceptance or refusal of the test was noted, as
   well as the success of the sleep study, as determined by a review of the
   raw data by a sleep medicine physician.

   1.17-3.45), and snoring (OR = 1.75, CI = 1.11-2.77) were associated with
   sleep test acceptance. Older patients were less likely to accept the
   test (OR = 0.48, CI = 0.30-0.76). Diabetics were less likely to complete
   the sleep test successfully (OR = 0.28, CI = 0.12-0.66).
   Advanced age is an important factor in test refusal and complications of
   diabetes contributes to test failure. Symptom matching may be a source
   of selection bias, as patients with risk factors for OSA are more likely
   to accept the diagnostic test.}},

Title = {{Unified fluid flow model for pressure transient analysis in naturally
   fractured media}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Naturally fractured reservoirs present special challenges for flow
   modeling with regards to their internal geometrical structure. The shape
   and distribution of matrix porous blocks and the geometry of fractures
   play key roles in the formulation of transient interporosity flow
   models. Although these models have been formulated for several typical
   geometries of the fracture networks, they appeared to be very dissimilar
   for different shapes of matrix blocks, and their analysis presents many
   technical challenges. The aim of this paper is to derive and analyze a
   unified approach to transient interporosity flow models for slightly
   compressible fluids that can be used for any matrix geometry and
   fracture network. A unified fractional differential transient
   interporosity flow model is derived using asymptotic analysis for
   singularly perturbed problems with small parameters arising from the
   assumption of a much smaller permeability of the matrix blocks compared
   to that of the fractures. This methodology allowed us to unify existing
   transient interporosity flow models formulated for different shapes of
   matrix blocks including bounded matrix blocks, unbounded matrix
   cylinders with any orthogonal crossection, and matrix slabs. The model
   is formulated using a fractional order diffusion equation for fluid
   pressure that involves Caputo derivative of order 1/2 with respect to
   time. Analysis of the unified fractional derivative model revealed that
   the surface area-to-volume ratio is the key parameter in the description
   of the flow through naturally fractured media. Expressions of this
   parameter are presented for matrix blocks of the same geometrical shape
   as well as combinations of different shapes with constant and random
   sizes. Numerical comparisons between the predictions of the unified
   model and those obtained from existing transient interporosity ones for
   matrix blocks in the form of slabs, spheres and cylinders are presented
   for linear, radial and spherical flow types for both fixed boundary
   pressure and rate.}},

   of asphaltenes}},
Journal = {{FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{133}},
Pages = {{120-127}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A sol-gel/emulsion technique was used to prepare dispersed Fe2O3
   nanoparticles in heavy oil and their affinity toward asphaltenes
   adsorption was assessed. The nanoparticles were identified using XRD and
   EDX and their mean diameter, 35 +/- 5 nm, was based on TEM estimates.
   Kinetic experiments showed that for the in situ prepared and commercial
   Fe2O3 nanoparticles constant uptake is essentially achieved in the first
   1 h, and DCM washing suggested mostly physisorbed hydrocarbons. The in
   situ prepared nanoparticles displayed much higher, 2.6 +/- 0.12 g/g, and
   much more selective asphaltene uptake. Increasing the concentration of
   the in situ prepared particles revealed a declining trend in the uptake
   versus equilibrium asphaltene concentration. Experiments to explore the
   effect of preparation parameters showed that water did not seem to
   influence the hydrocarbon uptake for the commercial Fe2O3 nanopartides,
   while heat treatment of the oil phase in the presence of the
   nano-particles reduced their uptake. Centrifuging the nanoparticle
   together with the adsorbed asphaltenes did not reduce the viscosity of
   the oil phase or its sulfur content due to the fact that centrifugation
   removed only a small portion of the nanoparticles. Crown Copyright (C)

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The increasing demand for electricity and the emergence of smart grids
   have presented new opportunities for home energy management systems
   (HEMS) in demand response markets. HEMS are demand response tools that
   shift and curtail demand to improve the energy consumption and
   production profile of a dwelling on behalf of a consumer. HEMS usually
   create optimal consumption and production schedules by considering
   multiple objectives such as energy costs, environmental concerns, load
   profiles, and consumer comfort.
   The existing literature has presented several methods, such as
   mathematical optimization, model predictive control, and heuristic
   control, for creating efficient operation schedules and for making good
   consumption and production decisions, However, the effectiveness of the
   methods in the existing literature can be difficult to compare due to
   diversity in modelling parameters, such as appliance models, timing
   parameters, and objectives.
   The present paper provides a comparative analysis of the literature on
   HEMS, with a focus on modelling approaches and their impact on HEMS
   operations and outcomes. In particular, we discuss a set of HEMS
   challenges such as forecast uncertainty, modelling device heterogeneity,
   multi-objective scheduling, computational limitations, timing
   considerations, and modelling consumer well-being.
   The presented work is organized to allow a reader to understand and
   compare the important considerations, approaches, nomenclature, and
   results in prominent and new literary works without delving deeply into
   each one. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Adsorption cooling machines are thermally driven systems. Solar

   The present work introduces a review of various adsorption equations of

Title = {{Inferring the role of NiO nanoparticles from the thermal behavior of
   virgin and adsorbed hydrocarbons}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},

Volume = {{147}},

Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Simultaneous analysis of differential thermogravimetry (DTG) and
   differential scanning calorimetry (DCS) data is the key for identifying
   probable reactions and extracting their kinetic parameters under
   isothermal and non-isothermal conditions. However, an assumption of
   kinetically controlled thermal behavior needs to be adequately examined.
   Mass transfer limitations as well as multiple reactions of multiple
   species may be encountered while studying the thermal behavior of virgin
   and adsorbed crude oils. This, in turn, leads to uncertainties on the
   actual role of the adsorbent. In this paper we address these challenges
   and reflect on recent publication by Nassar et al. (2013) pertaining to
   catalyzed oxidation of adsorbed asphaltenes onto NiO nanoparticles. More
   specifically, we show that accounting for mass loss due to the adsorbent
   nanoparticles increases the value of the activation energy and,
   subsequently, influences conclusions on the role of the nanoparticle. In
   addition, we show that, for a given temperature zone, presenting heat
   flow profiles per gram of mass lost within that zone provides more
   reliable comparison between the size of reaction peaks. Finally, we
   address the heat treatment of oil and its effect on the adsorbed
   species, and explore the role of surface exposure and the interaction
   between the nanoparticles and the heavy oil fractions. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for electrical load
   forecasting has been proposed in the literature. ANNs have some inherent

Abstract = {{Bamboo structured nitrogen doped multiwalled carbon nanotubes have been

   (CNx-GONRs) with a multifaceted microstructure have been obtained.
   CNx-GONRs have then been codoped with nitrogen and boron by simultaneous
   thermal annealing in ammonia and boron oxide atmospheres, respectively.
   The effects of the codoping time and temperature on the concentration of
   the dopants and their functional groups have been extensively
   investigated. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results indicate that
   pyridinic and BC3 are the main nitrogen and boron functional groups,
   respectively, in the codoped samples. The oxygen reduction reaction
   (ORR) properties of the samples have been measured in an alkaline
   electrolyte and compared with the state-of-the-art Pt/C (20\%)
   electrocatalyst. The results show that the nitrogen/boron codoped
   graphene nanoribbons with helically unzipped structures (CNx/CBx-GNRs)
   can compete with the Pt/C (20\%) electrocatalyst in all of the key ORR
   properties: onset potential, exchange current density, four electron
   pathway selectivity, kinetic current density, and stability. The
   development of such graphene nanoribbon-based electrocatalyst could be a
   harbinger of precious metal-free carbon-based nanomaterials for ORR
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Five-dimensional (5-D) light field video (LFV) (also known as plenoptic
   video) is a more powerful form of representing information of dynamic
   scenes compared to conventional three-dimensional (3-D) video. In this
   paper, the 5-D spectrum of an object in an LFV is derived for the
   important practical case of objects moving with constant velocity and at
   constant depth. In particular, it is shown that the region of support
   (ROS) of the 5-D spectrum is a skewed 3-D hyperfan in the 5-D frequency
   domain, with the degree of skew depending on the velocity and depth of
   the moving object. Based on this analysis, a 5-D depth-velocity digital
   filter to enhance moving objects in LFVs is proposed, described and
   implemented. Further, by means of the commercially available Lytro
   light-field camera, LFVs of real scenes are generated and used to test
   and confirm the performance of the 5-D depth-velocity filters for
   enhancing such objects.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments performed in this work explored how Ni-YSZ cermet anodes
   infiltrated with 1\% Sn or 1\% BaO mitigate carbon formation compared to
   undoped Ni-YSZ anodes in functioning solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). In
   situ vibrational Raman spectroscopy was used to study the early stages
   of carbon accumulation on the SOFC anodes at 730 degrees C with methane
   and under open circuit voltage (OCV) conditions. Additionally, carbon
   removal with different gas phase reforming agents was evaluated. The
   effects of these phenomena-carbon accumulation from methane and carbon
   removal by reforming agents-on the electrochemical capabilities of a
   device were monitored with electrochemical impedance and voltammetry
   measurements. Vibrational spectra showed that the undoped and 1\% Sn
   infiltrated anodes were very susceptible to carbon formation from
   methane while considerably less carbon accumulated on the 1\% BaO
   anodes. Electrochemical data, however, implied that carbon accumulated
   in different regions of the anode and that both Sn and BaO effectively
   reduced carbon accumulation but also inhibited electrochemical
   oxidation. For each anode, H2O was the most effective reforming agent
   for removing carbon followed by O-2 and then CO2. H2O and CO2, however,
   left the anode only partially oxidized, while prolonged exposure to O-2
   completely oxidized Ni to nickel oxide. The spectroscopic and
   electrochemical data showed strong correlations that provide mechanistic
   insight into the consequences of adding secondary materials to SOFC
   anodes with the intent of reducing carbon accumulation.}},

   to TCE as indicators. High TCE concentration did not exert positive or
   negative effects on the subsequent endogenous respiration rate or phenol
   dependent specific oxygen utilization rate (SOUR), indicating the
   absence of solvent stress and induction effect on phenol-hydroxylase.
   Phenol-grown aerobic granules exhibited a unique response to TCE
   transformation product toxicity, that small amount of TCE transformation
   enhanced the subsequent phenol SOUR. Granules that had transformed
   between 1.3 and 3.7 mg TCE g SS-1 showed at most 53\% increase in the
   subsequent phenol SOUR, and only when the transformation exceeded 6.6 mg
   TCE g SS-1 did the SOUR dropped below that of the control. This
   enhancing effect was found to sustain throughout several phenol dosages,
   and TCE transformation below the toxicity threshold also lessened the
   granules' sensitivity to higher phenol concentration. The unique toxic
   effect was possibly caused by the granule's compact structure as a
   protection barrier against the diffusive transformation product(s) of
   TCE co-metabolism. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and atomistic simulations of atomic
   friction with silicon oxide tips sliding on Au(111) are conducted at
   overlapping speeds. Experimental data unambiguously reveal a stick-slip
   friction plateau above a critical scanning speed, in agreement with the
   thermally activated Prandtl-Tomlinson (PTT) model. However, friction in
   experiments is larger than in simulations. PTT energetic parameters for
   the two are comparable, with minor differences attributable to the
   contact area's influence on the barrier to slip. Recognizing that the
   attempt frequency may be determined by thermal vibrations of the larger
   AFM tip mass or instrument noise fully resolves the discrepancy. Thus,
   atomic stick-slip is well described by the PTT model if sources of
   slip-assisting energy are accounted for.}},

   density functions (pdfs) are derived and turn out to be the weighted
   combination of a series of K-distributions. Several theoretical and
   implementation issues regarding the proposed generalization are
   discussed. Comparative experimental results using real SAR data
   indicates that these generalized forms of K may allow better estimation
   of the SAR pdf than that of the traditional K distribution.}},

Abstract = {{The capability of life-long learning is a stable set of attributes and
   skills related to interest in and self-regulation of Continuous
   learning. This and other attributes related to professional skill
   development have been increasingly viewed as a priority for the
   development in post-secondary education, rather than solely focusing on
   technical and discipline-specific knowledge acquisition. In the current
   study we examined the role of life-long learning as an antecedent of
   academic engagement in a university course using student engineering
   project teams with extensive team-related deliverables. We adopted
   multilevel longitudinal methodology and analytics to support several
   novel contributions. First, the general trend over the course of the
   semester was a decrease in academic engagement, but only for students
   low on the attribute of life-long learning. Second, life-long learning
   was a significant predictor of all 12 indicators of academic engagement
   over three time periods. Third, life-long learning was more important
   for academic engagement than other dispositional variables known to be
   relevant, namely conscientiousness and its facet of
   achievement-striving. As such, this adds unique evidence in support of
   recent accreditation initiatives, interventions, and learning structures
   that promote life-long learning development. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{We study the effect of background flow on the dissolution and transport
   of carbon dioxide (CO2) during geological storage in saline aquifers,
   and include the processes of diffusion, advection, and free convection.
   We develop a semianalytical model that captures the evolution of the
   dissolution in the absence of free convection. Using the semianalytical
   solution, we determine scaling relations for the steady rate of
   dissolution that follow either Jst similar to root PeR or J(st) similar
   to Pe depending on the value of Pe/R, where R represents the ratio of
   the extent of CO2 plume to the aquifer thickness and Pe is the Peclet
   number. Using direct numerical simulations, we provide detailed behavior
   of the convective mixing during the dissolution. We establish the
   criteria for forced and mixed (combined free and forced) convection in
   aquifers that is governed by the background flow. Accordingly, we
   provide the scaling relations Jst similar to root PeR and J(st) similar
   to RaR representing the forced and free convection asymptotes,
   respectively, where Ra is a Rayleigh number based on aquifer thickness.
   The results reveal that the background velocity can delay the onset of
   free convection and can alter the subsequent mixing. This phenomenon is
   more profound in the systems subject to strong background flows wherein
   horizontal component of the velocity field generated by background flow
   hinders the establishments of vertical component of the velocity field.
   Finally, by applying the proposed relations to several potential storage
   sites, we demonstrate the screening process in finding aquifers where
   the background flow exerts an important influence on the dissolution.}},

   lift closely follows the inverse tangent of the angle of incidence for
   virtually all measurements. This implies that the forces of interest are
   due largely to the instantaneous pressure distribution around the plate
   and are not significantly influenced by shear stresses. The
   instantaneous forces appear most complex for the smaller aspect ratios
   but the intensity of the normal force fluctuations is between 10\% and
   20\% in the free-steam but can exceed 30\% near the wall. As the wind
   tunnel floor is approached, the lift and drag reduce with increasing
   aspect ratio, and there is a reduction in the high frequency components
   of the forces. It is shown that the centre of pressure is closer to the
   centre of the plates than the quarter-chord position for nearly all
   cases.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of L-band equatorial ionospheric scintillation on Global
   Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receivers is investigated in this
   paper using both real and synthetic scintillation data. To this end,
   various low-latitude data sets, recorded during the most recent solar
   maximum, are exploited in post-processing to develop and verify
   realistic simulation tools and evaluate GNSS receiver performance. A
   scintillation simulation model is implemented based on the phase screen
   formulation of Dr. Charles Rino (1979, 1982, and 2011) which allows
   oblique signal propagation in an anisotropic propagation medium with
   multiple irregularity layers (or phase screens) for multiple GNSS
   frequencies. The observed real scintillation parameters are used to
   drive GNSS signal simulations. The subsequent simulated GNSS signal time
   series are verified through comparison with real data for different
   signal tracking states including the most severe and challenging
   tracking scenarios. Using both real and synthetic data sets, the impact
   of scintillation on observation quality and receiver performance is
   evaluated in terms of probability of loss of phase and frequency lock,
   as well as the correlation of disturbed L-band signals transmitted by
   GNSS satellites on the same transionsopheric path.}},

Title = {{Forward and backward processes for INS compass alignment}},
Journal = {{OCEAN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Initial alignment is a crucial procedure for inertial navigation systems
   (INS). Both the alignment speed and alignment accuracy are important for
   INS; however, these two goals are difficult to achieve by using general
   methods at the same time. In order to resolve this contradictory issue,
   the forward and backward processes based method for INS alignment can be
   used. A new data processing method called forward and backward processes
   has been applied in INS alignment, based on that, a further research of
   forward and backward processes for compass alignment is done in this
   paper. The main contribution of this paper is to study whether the
   contradictory issue could be properly solved by using the forward and
   backward compass processes under the conditions of existing both the
   internal constant inertial sensor errors and external oscillatory errors
   caused by vehicle motions. Since the compass alignment is established
   based on classical control theory, the analysis of forward and backward
   compass processes is carried out using the error equations in frequency
   domain. The analysis and simulation results indicate that forward and
   backward processes for compass alignment can well solve the
   contradiction problem between alignment speed and accuracy only in the
   case of existing constant inertial sensor errors, namely the method is
   not applicable for existence of oscillatory errors. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Natural convection in an open end cavity with a hot inclined wall is
   simulated based on the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). The physics of
   flow and energy transfer in open end cavities are addressed when the hot
   wall is inclined. The combination of the two topics (open cavity and
   inclined walls) is the main novelty of the present study. The effects of
   the angle of the hot inclined wall on the flow field and heat transfer
   are thoroughly investigated. The Prandtl number is fixed to 0.71 (air).
   The Rayleigh number and the angle of the hot inclined wall are varied in
   the range of 10(4) to 10(6) and 60A degrees to 85A degrees,
   respectively. The results are presented for two different aspect ratios,
   i.e., A = 1 and 2. The results obtained with the LBM are also compared
   with those of the finite volume method (FVM). The predicted results of
   the LBM conform to those of the FVM. The results show that by increasing
   the angle of the hot inclined wall and the aspect ratio of the cavity,
   the average Nusselt number decreases. The trend of the local Nusselt
   number on the inclined wall is also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Breast phantoms (BPs) are required to test and validate microwave breast
   imaging prototypes. For this purpose, a new BP made from carbon/rubber
   mixtures is proposed. These materials have: 1) electrical properties
   that are stable over time and representative of human target values and
   2) mechanical properties that allow the material to be flexible and
   withstand reasonable stress. To characterize and optimize the
   carbon/rubber materials, samples made with varying carbon concentrations
   were created and the dielectric properties were measured. From these
   materials, a skin layer, fatty layer, glandular structures, and phantom
   tumors were cast from three-dimensional (3-D) printed molds and
   assembled into a complete BP. These phantoms mimic the anatomical
   structures of the breast, are reconfigurable for a variety of tests, and
   are easy to create in a typical lab environment. A microwave breast
   imaging prototype system was used to measure reflections from BPs.
   Comparison with reflections from human trials demonstrated that the
   phantom provides appropriate skin reflections. Phantoms incorporating
   glandular structures were imaged using a delay-and-sum technique. A
   response consistent with the position of the inclusions was observed.
   Overall, the carbon-based phantoms provide similar reflections to human
   tissue, and have proven useful for testing our imaging algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{The phase-behavior and thermophysical properties of bitumen/solvent
   systems are of crucial importance for heavy-oil and bitumen in-situ
   recovery methods. The viscosity reduction as a result of solvent
   dissolution and/or steam heating is the main recovery mechanism in the
   solvent-based bitumen-recovery processes. In this paper, the viscosity
   of bitumen, pentane, and their mixtures at different pentane weight
   fractions (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5) are accurately measured.
   The measurements are conducted under conditions applicable for both
   in-situ recovery methods and the pipeline transportation of heavy oil.
   The experiments are taken with Athabasca bitumen at temperatures varying
   from ambient up to 200 degrees C and at pressures up to 10 MPa. The data
   for the mixtures are evaluated with predictive schemes as well as with
   correlation models representing certain mixing rules proposed in the
   literature. The influences of pressure, temperature, and solvent weight
   fraction on the viscosity of mixtures are considered in the models and
   evaluated from the experimental data. The results indicated that the
   power-law model and the Cragoe model (Cragoe 1933) represent the data
   better than other models that use a volume-fraction basis.}},

   Media}},
Journal = {{SPE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{239-247}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This is the second paper of a series in which we study heavy oil in
   porous media. The first paper dealt with an experimental study (Wang et
   al. 2008), whereas a mathematical and simulation study is presented
   here. The research program stems from the need to predict the field
   performance of a class of heavy-foamy-oil reservoirs. These reservoirs
   show a better-than-expected primary performance: lower production
   gas/oil ratios (GORs), higher-than-expected production rates, and higher
   oil recovery. A mechanism used to account for the observed performance
   is that the liberated solution gas is entrained in the oil when the
   reservoir pressure falls below the thermodynamic equilibrium bubblepoint
   pressure. The presence of entrained gas increases the effective
   compressibility of the oil phase and prevents gas from becoming a free
   phase. Hence, the foamy oil behaves as if it had a pseudobubblepoint
   pressure below the usual equilibrium bubblepoint pressure. This paper
   describes a pseudobubblepoint model and a methodology that can be used
   to compute foamy-oil fluid properties from conventional laboratory
   pressure/volume/temperature (PVT) data. The techniques developed are
   then used to study foamy oil in the Orinoco belt, Venezuela. The present
   mathematical model is validated by comparing numerical and experimental
   results.}},

Abstract = {{One of the primary objectives of highway agencies in Canada is providing
   a safe and reliable road network with a good level of service. In the
   Province of Alberta specific International Roughness Index (IRI)
   threshold values classify pavements into good, fair, and poor condition
   categories to manage and schedule rehabilitation and maintenance
   programs. This research investigated the significant factors that affect
   the perception of road roughness and established IRI threshold values
   for good, fair, and poor road condition based on public perception. A
   questionnaire was designed to investigate the road users' perception and
   included questions covering gender, age, familiarity with the road, type
   and model of car, and perception of road roughness. In addition,
   psychometric scaling analysis was used to develop a set of IRI threshold
   values for classifying road condition based on public perception in the
   Province of Alberta. According to the results of the survey, Alberta
   Transportation threshold values of IRI do not agree with the road users'
   opinion and an alternate set of threshold values was developed. The
   analysis of the survey results identified that trip purpose, driving
   experience, dry surface, and familiarity with the road are the most
   significant factors that influence the perception of road roughness.}},

Title = {{Model for Surface Diffusion of Adsorbed Gas in Nanopores of Shale Gas

Abstract = {{Surface diffusion plays a key role in gas mass transfer due to the
   majority of adsorbed gas within abundant nanopores of organic matter in
   shale gas reservoirs. Surface diffusion simulation is very complex as a
   result of high reservoir pressure, surface heterogeneity, and
   nonisothermal desorption in shale gas reservoirs. In this paper, a new
   model of surface diffusion for adsorbed gas in shale gas reservoirs is
   established, which is based on a Hwang model derived under a low
   pressure condition and considers the effect of adsorbed gas coverage
   under high pressure. Additionally, this new model considers the effects
   of surface heterogeneity, isosteric sorption heat, and nonisothermal gas
   desorption. Results show that (1) the surface diffusion coefficient
   increases with pressure and temperature, while it decreases with
   activation energy and gas molecular weight; (2) contributions of viscous
   flow, Knudsen diffusion, and surface diffusion to the total gas mass
   transfer are varying during the development of shale gas reservoirs,
   which are mainly controlled by nanopore-scale and pressure; (3) in
   micropores (pore radius of <2 nm), the contribution of surface diffusion
   to the gas mass transfer is dominant, up to 92.95\%; in macropores (pore
   radius of >50 nm), the contribution is less than 4.39\%, which is
   negligible; in mesopores (2 nm < pore radius < 50 nm), the contribution
   is between micropores and macropores.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon nanotube (CNT) nanocomposites with a polystyrene thermoplastic
   matrix were injection molded and the high shear stress exerted during
   the injection process partially enabled the alignment of the CNTs in the

   of alignment were produced, and their thermal conductivities were
   measured based on ASTM D5470. The results were compared with compression
   molded samples featuring random alignments of CNTs. The results showed
   that the injection molded samples possessed anisotropic thermal
   conductivities, due to the partial alignment of the CNTs in the flow
   direction. The effective medium approach was used to analytically
   estimate the thermal conductivity of the molded samples. Good agreement
   was observed between the experimental and analytically simulated results
   in lower CNT concentrations (less than 5 wt\% of CNT). Using
   transmission electron microscopy pictures taken of the nanocomposites,
   the alignment of CNTs in the thermoplastic matrix were modeled; and

Abstract = {{Dielectric-barrier discharge plasma actuators were mounted on a circular

   spanwise-modulated blowing profile with a spanwise wavelength of four
   cylinder diameters, such that three-dimensional instabilities in the
   wake were targeted for control. Considerable spanwise variation in the
   wake was achieved with low-power forcing when the actuators were mounted
   at the location of maximum shear layer receptivity. This spanwise
   variation was a direct consequence of the difference in the vorticity
   levels of the shed vortices from the cylinder. High power forcing nearly
   eliminated vortex shedding, leading to a considerable amount of drag
   reduction as measured in the intermediate wake.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time precise orbit and clock products are crucial for real-time
   high-precision precise point positioning (PPP). The key for precise
   orbit prediction is to precisely determine the initial conditions
   (satellite position, velocity at the initial epoch) and the solar
   radiation pressure (SRP) parameters using an arc of known precise
   orbits. The optimal arc length will be investigated for precise orbit
   prediction, with which the high-accuracy satellite clocks can be
   estimated. The orbit prediction accuracies with different arc lengths
   and conditions over time are also investigated. The results indicate
   that the predicted orbit accuracy is governed by the SRP parameters. In
   addition, the predicted orbits and estimated clocks are evaluated
   quantitatively with respect to PPP solutions during in and out of
   eclipses seasons, based on which the optimal arc length is identified.
   The numerical results show that high-accuracy orbital prediction can be
   achieved using an arc length between 36 and 48 h and generally an arc
   length of 42 h is considered to be optimal. With this optimal arc
   length, the estimated clock accuracy is 0.048 and 0.122 ns for a
   prediction interval of 6 and 24 h, respectively. The average PPP
   ambiguity fix-rates with a prediction interval of 6 h are 80.2 and 84.7
   \% over an observation period of 30 min and 1 h, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the effects of equatorial ionospheric scintillation on
   GNSS signal tracking performance during the current solar maximum a
   research project was established between the Brazilian Institute of
   Geography and Statistics (IBGE), the University of the State of Rio de
   Janeiro (UERJ), and the Position, Location and Navigation (PLAN) Group
   of the Department of Geomatics Engineering, University of Calgary
   (UofC). This was done using intermediate frequency (IF) data processed
   with a software receiver and code and carrier phase data obtained using
   a standard geodetic receiver located at the same site. The main benefit
   of using a software receiver is flexibility. IF data was collected daily
   from 8 to 12 p.m. local time (11 p.m. to 3 a.m. UTC) using a
   dual-frequency front-end at IBGE facilities in Rio de Janeiro, from June
   2012 to March 2013, whenever scintillation occurred. Four observation
   sessions were selected for processing along with another one with no
   scintillation, for comparison. The front-end antenna was located only 5
   m away from a standard receiver antenna of the Brazilian active geodetic
   network, to allow a comparison of the two solutions under the same
   conditions. In the observation domain, the software receiver produced no
   actual cycle slips and only up to 4 \% of missing L2 observations,
   indicating that the state-of-the-art acquisition and tracking algorithms
   used are resistant to equatorial ionospheric scintillation, whereas for
   the hardware receiver up to 288 cycle slips were detected and 13 \% of
   L2 observations missing over a 4-h session under strong scintillation.
   The latter represents an improvement of a factor of 3 over the
   performance of another hardware receiver used at the same site 10 years
   ago during the previous solar maximum. In the position domain, Precise
   Point Positioning solutions using L1 code observations gave very similar
   results for the software and hardware receivers in all sessions, with
   the ionosphere being responsible for degrading coordinate accuracies up
   to a factor of 12. The best positioning accuracies were those given by
   dual-frequency solutions, at the centimeter to a few decimeters level in
   kinematic mode.}},

Abstract = {{Co-based FSX-414 superalloy is especially used for first-stage nozzles
   of gas turbines. Transient liquid phase (TLP) bonding has potential as
   repair process for these nozzles. In this study, homogenization of
   TLP-bonded FSX-414 superalloy at optimum bonding condition (1150 A
   degrees C/5 min) was conducted at 1175, 1200, and 1225 A degrees C for
   1, 3, and 6 h. Homogenization at 1175 A degrees C/1 h had no effect on
   removing the diffusion-affected zone (DAZ) phases. Increasing the time
   to 6 h was effective in removing DAZ phases and boride phases formed due
   to liquefaction, but compositional homogenization was not complete.
   Homogenization at 1200 A degrees C for 1 h caused boride phases to form
   adjacent to the joint and in the base metal. By increasing the time to 3
   h produced joint, free of these phases. At 1225 A degrees C/3 h
   homogenization condition, using a Ni-etchant and EDS analysis across the
   joint showed appropriate combination of compositional and
   microstructural homogenization including removed DAZ phases. The highest
   hardness, the most uniform hardness profile across the joint, and the
   highest shear strength (91\% of the base metal strength) in addition to
   the microstructural features showed the best joints homogenizing at 1225

Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess ovine synovial fluid (oSF) from different
   post-injury time points for (1) proteoglycan-4 (PRG4) and hyaluronan
   (HA) concentration, (2) HA molecular weight (MW) distribution, (3)
   cartilage boundary lubrication function, and (4) lubricant
   composition-function relationships. The association between cartilage
   boundary lubrication and gross cartilage changes after injury was also
   examined.
   Methods: oSF was collected 2, 4, 10, and 20 weeks post anterior cruciate
   ligament (ACL) transection in five skeletally mature sheep. PRG4 and HA
   concentrations were measured using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent
   assay, and HA MW distribution by agarose gel electrophoresis. Cartilage
   boundary lubrication of oSF was assessed using a cartilage-cartilage
   friction test. Gross damage to articular cartilage was also quantified
   at 20 weeks using modified Drez scoring protocol.
   Results: Early (2-4 weeks) after ACL injury, PRG4 concentrations were
   significantly higher (P = 0.045, P = 0.037), and HA concentrations were
   substantially lower (P = 0.005, P = 0.005) compared to 20 weeks. The HA
   MW distribution also shifted towards lower ranges in the early
   post-injury stage. The kinetic friction coefficients were significantly
   higher 2-4 weeks post injury (P = 0.008 and P = 0.049) compared to 20
   weeks. Poor cartilage boundary lubricating ability early after injury

   Conclusion: Altered composition and diminished boundary lubrication of
   oSF early after ACL transection may pre-dispose the articular cartilage
   to degenerative changes and initiate osteoarthritis (OA). These
   observations also provide potential motivation for biotherapeutic
   interventions at earlier time points post injury. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Bone is a porous structure with a solid phase that contains
   hydroxyapatite and collagen. Due to its composition, bone is often
   represented either as a poroelastic or as a viscoelastic material;
   however, the poro-viscoelastic formulation that allows integrating the
   effect of both the fluid flow and the collagen on the mechanical
   response of the tissue, has not been applied yet. The objective of this
   study was to develop a micro computed tomography (mu CT)-based finite
   element (FE) model of trabecular bone that includes both the poroelastic
   and the viscoelastic nature of the tissue. Cubes of trabecular bone
   (N=25) from human distal tibia were scanned with mu CT and stress
   relaxation experiments were conducted. The mu CT images were the basis
   for sample specific FE models, and the stress relaxation experiments
   were simulated applying a poro-viscoelastic formulation. The model
   considers two scales of the tissue: the intertrabecular pore and the
   lacunar-canalicular pore scales. Independent viscoelastic and
   poroelastic models were also developed to determine their contribution
   to the poro-viscoelastic model, All the experiments exhibited a similar
   relaxation trend. The average reaction force before relaxation was 9.28x
   10(2) N (SD +/- 5.11 x 10(2) N), and after relaxation was 4.69 x 10(2) N
   (SD +/- 2.88 x 10(2) N). The slope of the regression line between the
   force before and after relaxation was 1.92 (R-2=0.96). The
   poro-viscoelastic models captured 49\% of the variability of the
   experimental data before relaxation and 33\% after relaxation. The
   relaxation predicted with viscoelastic models was similar to the
   poro-viscoelastic ones; however, the poroelastic formulation
   underestimated the reaction force before relaxation. These data suggest
   that the contribution of viscoelasticity (fluid flow-independent
   mechanism) to the mechanical response of the tissue is significantly
   greater than the contribution of the poroelasticity (fluid
   flow-dependent mechanism). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All lights reserved.}},

Title = {{A comparison of methods for in vivo assessment of cortical porosity in
   the human appendicular skeleton}},
Journal = {{BONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{167-175}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The recent advent of high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed
   tomography (HR-pQCT) provides new opportunities to measure in vivo human
   bone microarchitecture. Increasingly, cortical porosity (CtPo) is of
   particular interest due to its relationship with bone quality and
   turnover. The two approaches that have emerged to measure CtPo from
   HR-pQCT are threshold-based and density-based methods, and the purpose
   of this work was to compare the performance of each against a
   gold-standard synchrotron radiation micro-computed tomography (SR mu CT)
   measurement. Human cadaveric cortical bone specimens (N = 23) were
   measured by SR mu CT and HR-pQCT, and high correlations were found for
   both methods. The density-based approach had an r(2) = 0.939 (95\%
   confidence interval (CI) of +6.17\% to +20.99\%) and consistently
   overestimated porosity as measured by SR mu CT, while the
   threshold-based approach had an r(2) = 0.977 and consistently
   underestimated porosity (95\% CI of -2.60\% to -10.76\%). The
   density-based approach is prone to beam hardening artifacts and
   susceptible to natural variations of tissue mineral density (TMD), but
   is less affected by motion artifacts that may occur in in vivo scans.
   The threshold-based method has the advantage that it provides structural
   information that complements the cortical porosity measure, such as
   number of pores and connectivity, and can accurately detect the larger
   pores which are the most relevant to bone biomechanical strength. With
   the first generation HR-pQCT systems the accuracy of detecting pores
   larger than 140 pm diameter is excellent (r(2) = 0.983; 95\% Cl of
   -4.88\% to +2.45\%). The accuracy of the threshold-based method will
   improve as new HR-pQCT systems emerge and provide a robust quantitative
   approach to measure cortical porosity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   and long-term internal variables}},
Journal = {{Biomedical Engineering Online}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{MAR 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Differential-type and integral-type formulations are two
   common approaches in modeling viscoelastic materials. A
   differential-type theory is often derived from a Helmholtz free energy
   function and is usually more suitable for the prediction of strain-rate
   dependent mechanical behavior during rapid loading, while an
   integral-type theory usually captures stress relaxation more efficiently
   than a differential-type theory. A modeling approach is needed to
   predict the viscoelastic responses during both rapid loading and
   relaxation phases.
   Methods: A constitutive modeling methodology based on the short and
   long-term internal variables was proposed in the present study in order
   to fully use the better features of the two types of theories. The
   short-term variables described the loading rate, while the long-term
   variables involving time constants characterized loading history and
   stress relaxation.
   Results: The application of the methodology was demonstrated with
   particular formulations for ligament and articular cartilage. Model
   parameters were calibrated for both tissues with experimental data from
   the literature. It was found that the proposed model could well predict
   a wide range of strain-rate dependent load responses during both loading
   and relaxation phases.
   Conclusion: Introducing different internal variables in terms of their
   time scales reduced the difficulties in the material characterization
   process and enabled the model to predict the experimental data more
   accurately, in particular at high strain-rates.}},

Abstract = {{Radiosonde observations provide a good data source for examining the
   long-term trend of atmospheric water vapour, temperature and cold point
   tropopause (CPT). In this article, precipitable water vapour (PWV) and
   surface temperature from the Hong Kong radiosonde station over the
   period of 1973-2012 are analysed. We find that the atmospheric water
   vapour in Hong Kong in the layers from the surface to approximately
   1181m, from approximate to 1181 to approximate to 2509m, from
   approximate to 2509 to approximate to 5126m and from approximate to 5126
   to approximate to 8093m accounts for 50, 25, 20 and 5\% of the PWV,
   respectively. The atmosphere is almost completely dry above
   approximately 8000m. Surface temperature has increased at a rate of 0.16
   degrees decade(-1) over the past 40 years. On a seasonal timescale, the
   largest rate of increase is 0.23 degrees decade(-1) in winter and the
   smallest rate is 0.09 degrees decade(-1) in spring. The CPT height is
   located at approximately 17.5km above mean sea level over the period of
   this study. This CPT height is estimated to have risen at a rate of
   87.3m decade(-1) over 1983-2012, which is 1.36 times the global average.
   The CPT temperature is observed to decrease at a rate of 0.84 degrees
   decade(-1), which is 2.05 times the global average. Taking advantage of
   the periodicity of PWV and surface temperature over the past 40 years,
   Fourier series analysis models have been developed. The models are

Abstract = {{The biomechanics of the patellofemoral (PF) joint is complex in nature,
   and the aetiology of such manifestations of PF instability as
   patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is still unclear. At this point, the
   particular factors affecting PFPS have not yet been determined. This
   study has two objectives: (1) The first is to develop an alternative
   geometric method using a three-dimensional (3D) registration technique
   and linear mapping to investigate the PF joint contact stress using an
   indirect measure: the depth of virtual penetration (PD) of the patellar
   cartilage surface into the femoral cartilage surface. (2) The second is
   to develop 3D PF joint models using the finite element analysis (FEA) to
   quantify in vivo cartilage contact stress and to compare the peak
   contact stress location obtained from the FE models with the location of
   the maximum PD. Magnetic resonance images of healthy and PFPS subjects
   at knee flexion angles of 15 degrees, 30 degrees and 45 degrees during
   isometric loading have been used to develop the geometric models. The
   results obtained from both approaches demonstrated that the subjects
   with PFPS show higher PD and contact stresses than the normal subjects.
   Maximum stress and PD increase with flexion angle, and occur on the
   lateral side in healthy and on the medial side in PFPS subjects. It has
   been concluded that the alternative geometric method is reliable in
   addition to being computationally efficient compared with FEA, and has
   the potential to assess the mechanics of PFPS with an accuracy similar
   to the FEA.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptable design is an approach to design adaptable products whose
   modules/configurations and parameter values can be changed during an
   operation stage to satisfy different customer requirements. An open
   architecture product is an adaptable product with open interfaces to
   allow the third-party vendors to develop new add-on modules and connect
   these add-on modules through the open interfaces. In this work, an open
   architecture adaptable product is modelled by a platform, alternative
   add-on modules, and open interfaces to connect the add-on modules with
   the platform. Both the specific add-on modules that need to be designed
   at the product development stage and the unknown add-on modules that
   could be added in the future are considered. In this research, a novel
   robust design approach is introduced to identify the optimal design of
   an open architecture adaptable product whose functional performance
   measures are the least sensitive to variations of the product and
   operating parameters due to uncertainties. First, characteristics of
   open architecture adaptable products are discussed. Methods for
   modelling of platform, add-on modules, and open interfaces are then
   introduced. A multi-level optimisation method is subsequently explained
   to identify the optimal design configuration and parameters considering
   product performance measures and their variations.}},

Abstract = {{Flood frequency analysis (FFA) is essential for water resources
   management. Long flow records improve the precision of estimated
   quantiles; however, in some cases, sample size in one location is not
   sufficient to achieve a reliable estimate of the statistical parameters
   and thus, regional FFA is commonly used to decrease the uncertainty in
   the prediction. In this paper, the bias of several commonly used
   parameter estimators, including L-moment, probability weighted moment
   and maximum likelihood estimation, applied to the general extreme value
   (GEV) distribution is evaluated using a Monte Carlo simulation. Two bias
   compensation approaches: compensation based on the shape parameter, and
   compensation using three GEV parameters, are proposed based on the
   analysis and the models are then applied to streamflow records in
   southern Alberta. Compensation efficiency varies among estimators and
   between compensation approaches. The results overall suggest that
   compensation of the bias due to the estimator and short sample size
   would significantly improve the accuracy of the quantile estimation. In
   addition, at-site FFA is able to provide reliable estimation based on
   short data, when accounting for the bias in the estimator appropriately.

Abstract = {{A new hybrid algorithm based on the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) and
   the finite-volume method (FVM) is proposed for numerically calculating
   the emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from building
   materials and predicting their space distribution. Most building
   envelopes are comprised of single as well as multilayer materials, with
   some of them being porous and others nonporous. First, only the LBM is
   used to calculate the VOC concentration in airtight and ventilated
   chambers with constant as well as variable ventilation. For multilayer
   materials, including both porous and nonporous, half-lattice division
   methodology in the LBM is used, which ensures flux continuity at the
   interfaces. Good agreement is found between computed results and
   experimental data available in the literature. The effect of variable
   ventilation is also studied for both types of sequences of
   porous/nonporous layers. Then the LBM coupled with the FVM is used to
   investigate the VOC concentration distribution in the room emitted from
   styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) plate, and good agreement is found
   between obtained results and those already published. The hybrid
   algorithm with multilayer approach is also used to conduct a detailed
   study of the effect of different ventilation organizations on the
   concentration in the room air, and the best one is found by the
   simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Here, our objective was to develop a spatio-temporal image fusion model
   (STI-FM) for enhancing temporal resolution of Landsat-8 land surface
   temperature (LST) images by fusing LST images acquired by the Moderate
   Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS); and implement the
   developed algorithm over a heterogeneous semi-arid study area in Jordan,
   Middle East. The STI-FM technique consisted of two major components: (i)
   establishing a linear relationship between two consecutive MODIS 8-day
   composite LST images acquired at time 1 and time 2; and (ii) utilizing
   the above mentioned relationship as a function of a Landsat-8 LST image
   acquired at time 1 in order to predict a synthetic Landsat-8 LST image
   at time 2. It revealed that strong linear relationships (i.e., r(2),
   slopes, and intercepts were in the range 0.93-0.94, 0.94-0.99; and
   2.97-20.07) existed between the two consecutive MODIS LST images. We
   evaluated the synthetic LST images qualitatively and found high visual
   agreements with the actual Landsat-8 LST images. In addition, we
   conducted quantitative evaluations of these synthetic images; and found
   strong agreements with the actual Landsat-8 LST images. For example,
   r(2), root mean square error (RMSE), and absolute average difference
   (AAD)-values were in the ranges 084-0.90, 0.061-0.080, and 0.003-0.004,

Abstract = {{Sb(V) removal using Fe-modified aerobic granules was investigated.
   Increasing the biomass dosage improved the Sb(V) removal rate, but
   lowered the adsorption quantity; the optimal biomass concentration was
   20 g/L (wet basis). Adsorption equilibrium was obtained at 2 h at 175
   rpm; the adsorption quantity was 36.6 mg/g. NaCl and other salts
   inhibited Sb(V) adsorption on Fe-modified granules, and the mechanism
   possibly lied more with the anions. The adsorption isotherms were
   evaluated using the Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin models. The
   Langmuir model best described the adsorption process, and gave a maximum
   monolayer adsorption quantity of 125 mg/g. The Delta H value for
   adsorption was 16.1 KJ/mol, indicating endothermicity, and the negative
   Delta G values at various temperatures suggested spontaneous adsorption.
   Outer-sphere and inner-sphere complexations were involved in Sb(V)

Abstract = {{A dynamic tracking model for the reservoir water flooding of a separated
   layer water injection was established. Based on the basic principles of
   heat and mass transfer, the water profile was determined using a well
   temperature curve. The Poisson process analysis and stochastic process
   methods were applied to calculate the water saturation, water
   breakthrough time, and water cut of each layer in a water-flooded
   reservoir at any given time. When the oil reservoir was producing water,
   the water cut predicted by the models, with consideration of the
   micro-pore distribution, approximated the practical measurement, having
   an error of less than 5 \%. The sample application clearly indicated
   that larger water injection intensity (water intake per unit thickness)
   could result in more drastic water saturation variation, earlier water
   breakthrough, and faster increase in the water cut for layers with
   numerous high-permeability channels, such as fractures.}},

Abstract = {{One of the basic material characteristics of solids is Poisson's ratio.
   Its exact knowledge, including its dependence on time, allows us to
   model the effect of load, with given boundary conditions, on the
   behavior of material under consideration. Poisson's ratio, or rather the
   relationship between the longitudinal and transverse strain, has an
   important implication in engineering mechanical applications (assessment
   of pavement structure performance). Nowadays, Poisson's ratio is usually
   used as a constant, based on an incorrect assumption that a hot asphalt
   mix is a linear elastic material. This paper reports Poisson's ratio as
   a function of time determined from the relaxation and small amplitude
   oscillation tests on cylindrical specimens. A hot asphalt mix is
   considered homogeneous isotropic material and linear theory of
   viscoelasticity is applied for the experimental determination of the
   lateral contraction ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial information plays a critical role in remote sensing and mapping
   applications such as environment surveying and disaster monitoring. An
   Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-borne mobile mapping system (MMS) can
   accomplish rapid spatial information acquisition under limited sky
   conditions with better mobility and flexibility than other means. This
   study proposes a long endurance Direct Geo-referencing (DG)-based
   fixed-wing UAV photogrammetric platform and two DG modules that each use
   different commercial Micro-Electro Mechanical Systems' (MEMS) tactical
   grade Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). Furthermore, this study
   develops a novel kinematic calibration method which includes lever arms,
   boresight angles and camera shutter delay to improve positioning
   accuracy. The new calibration method is then compared with the
   traditional calibration approach. The results show that the accuracy of
   the DG can be significantly improved by flying at a lower altitude using
   the new higher specification hardware. The new proposed method improves
   the accuracy of DG by about 20\%. The preliminary results show that
   two-dimensional (2D) horizontal DG positioning accuracy is around 5.8 m
   at a flight height of 300 m using the newly designed tactical grade
   integrated Positioning and Orientation System (POS). The positioning
   accuracy in three-dimensions (3D) is less than 8 m.}},

Abstract = {{Forest fires are a critical natural disturbance in most of the forested
   ecosystems around the globe, including the Canadian boreal forest where
   fires are recurrent. Here, our goal was to develop a new daily-scale
   forest fire danger forecasting system (FFDFS) using remote sensing data
   and implement it over the northern part of Canadian province of Alberta
   during 2009-2011 fire seasons. The daily-scale FFDFS was comprised of
   Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived four-input
   variables, i.e., 8-day composite of surface temperature (T-S),
   normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and normalized multiband
   drought index (NMDI); and daily precipitable water (PW). The T-S, NMDI,
   and NDVI variables were calculated during i period and PW during j day
   and then integrated to forecast fire danger conditions in five
   categories (i.e., extremely high, very high, high, moderate, and low)
   during j + 1 day. Our findings revealed that overall 95.51\% of the
   fires fell under ``extremely high{''} to ``moderate{''} danger classes.
   Therefore, FFDFS has potential to supplement operational
   meteorological-based forecasting systems in between the observed
   meteorological stations and remote parts of the landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Coculturing of two white-rot fungi, Dichomitus squalens and
   Ceriporiopsis subvermispora, was explored for the optimization of
   cultivation media for simultaneous augmentation of laccase and
   peroxidase activities by response surface methodology (RSM). Nutrient
   parameters chosen from our previous studies with the monocultures of D.
   squalens and C. subvermispora were used to design the experiments for
   the cocultivation study. Glucose, arabinose, sodium nitrate, casein,
   copper sulfate (CuSO4), and manganese sulfate (MnSO4) were combined
   according to central composite design and used as the incubation medium
   for the cocultivation. The interaction of glucose and sodium nitrate
   resulted in laccase and peroxidase activities of approximately 800U/g
   protein. The addition of either glucose or sodium nitrate to the medium
   also modifies the impact of other nutrients on the ligninolytic
   activity. Both enzyme activities were cross-regulated by arabinose,
   casein, CuSO4, and MnSO4 as a function of concentrations. Based on RSM,
   the optimum nutrient levels are 1\% glucose, 0.1\% arabinose, 20mM
   sodium nitrate, 0.27\% casein, 0.31mM CuSO4, and 0.07mM MnSO4.
   Cocultivation resulted in the production of laccase of 1,378U/g protein
   and peroxidase of 1,372U/g protein. Lignin (16.9\%) in wheat straw was
   degraded by the optimized enzyme mixture. (C) 2014 International Union

Abstract = {{A new method to obtain the rate constant and activation energy
   independent of a kinetic model is proposed and evaluated for
   thermochemical conversion, specifically in the steam and CO2
   gasification of coal and biomass. Recent works on gas solid reactions
   are based on single-step chemical reaction models that have been
   increasing in complexity through the use of more regression parameters
   to fit experimental data. These models fit better; however, sometimes
   their kinetic parameters are inconsistent, resulting in an incorrect
   interpretation of the reaction mechanism.
   The proposed method, which does not require any assumed kinetic model,
   is useful in calculating the parameters of the Arrhenius equation using
   cumulative variables obtained from the experimental data, i.e.
   conversion and residence time. For this reason, the uncertainty is
   reduced compared to conventional methods. The new method could be used
   as a consistency test between different kinetic models by comparing
   their kinetic parameters with those obtained with the proposed
   free-model method.
   The procedure has been applied to our previous experimental work and
   other authors' information on CO2 and steam gasification, verifying that
   the random pore model is not the best kinetic model to represent
   gasification and partial oxidation of coal and biomass. The new
   procedure can be used as a tool for chemical reaction engineering
   analysis in a broad range of thermochemical reactions under isothermal
   consideration. (c) 2014 The Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published

Pages = {{267-276}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In this work, the effect of the size and geometrical shape of coating
   defects on pipeline corrosion under alternating current (AC)
   interference in a deoxygenated, near-neutral pH bicarbonate solution was
   studied by direct current (DC) potential analysis, polarization curve
   measurements, and surface characterization. The results demonstrate that
   the size of the defect is critical to AC corrosion of steel occurring at
   the defect base. When a defect is small, the threshold AC to induce
   pitting corrosion is low. Moreover, both anodic and cathodic current
   densities decrease, which is attributed to the blocking effect of
   corrosion product accumulating at the defect. The shape of the defect
   affects corrosion only when the defect is small, e.g., 5 mm in diameter.
   The effect becomes undetectable when the defect is large, e.g., 10 mm in
   diameter. Generally, circular and triangular defects are associated with
   the most and least negative DC potentials as well as the largest and
   smallest anodic current densities, respectively, while square-shaped
   defects fell somewhere in between in terms of both potential density and
   current density values.}},

Title = {{Influence of Asphaltene Aggregation on the Adsorption and Catalytic

Abstract = {{This study is a continuation of our previous works on the use of
   metal-based nanoparticles for the adsorption of asphaltenes and its
   subsequent catalytic thermal decomposition. In this study, we evaluated
   the effects of asphaltene aggregation on the adsorption process and the
   subsequent catalytic oxidation using fumed silica and nanoparticles of
   NiO and/or PdO supported on fumed silica. Adsorption isotherms were
   constructed through batch adsorption experiments at 25 degrees C by
   using mixtures of n-heptane and toluene in amounts of 0, 20\% v/v
   n-heptane (Heptol 20), and 40\% v/v n-heptane (Heptol 40) to obtain
   different aggregate sizes of asphaltenes. Subsequently, asphaltene
   oxidation in the presence and absence of the nanoparticles was carried
   out in a TGA/FTIR system to investigate the impact of adsorbed
   asphaltene aggregates on the catalytic activity of the selected
   nanoparticles. The adsorption isotherms were described by the
   solidliquid equilibrium (SLE) model, and the catalytic behavior of the
   nanoparticles was compared based upon the trend of effective activation
   energies using the isoconversional method of Ozawa, Flynn, and Wall (OFW
   method). The results showed that the K parameter of the SLE model for
   both nanoparticles followed the trend of Heptol 40 > Heptol 20 >
   toluene, indicating that, as the amount of precipitant in the solution
   increases, a higher degree of asphaltene self-association on the active
   site of the catalysts is found. On the other hand, the H parameter
   revealed higher adsorption affinities as the n-heptane in the solution
   increased. However, when different adsorbents were compared at a fixed
   asphaltene concentration from the same solution, it was found that the
   use of functionalized nanoparticles led to a lower degree of asphaltene
   self-association and a higher affinity. A correlation between the
   effective activation energies from the OFW model and the SLE parameters
   was developed, finding that, for a fixed adsorbent, Ea increases as the
   affinity and the degree of self-association of asphaltenes increases.
   However, when the same asphaltenes were compared using different
   adsorbents, it was observed that E-alpha increases as the affinity
   decreases and the degree of asphaltene self-association increases.
   Consequently, this work shows the effect of the adsorption process on
   the catalytic activity of the nanoparticles. The reported results should
   give a better context for the use of such nanoparticles for the
   upgrading of heavy and extra-heavy oil.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the highly heterogeneous and dynamic nature of urban areas in
   Chinese cities, air pollution exhibits well-defined spatial variations.
   Rapid urbanization in China has heightened the importance of
   understanding and characterizing atmospheric particulate matter (PM)
   concentrations and their spatiotemporal variations. To investigate the
   small-scale spatial variations in PM in Xiamen, total suspended
   particulate (TSP), PM10, PM5 and PM2.5 measurements were collected
   between August and September in 2012. Their average mass concentrations
   were 102.50 mu g center dot m(-3), 82.79 mu g center dot m(-3), 55.67 mu
   g center dot m(-3) and 43.70 mu g center dot m(-3), respectively.
   Organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) in PM2.5 were measured
   using thermal optical transmission. Based on the PM concentrations for
   all size categories, the following order for the different functional
   areas studied was identified: hospital > park > commercial area >
   residential area > industrial area. OC contributed approximately
   5\%-23\% to the PM2.5 mass, whereas EC accounted for 0.8\%-6.95\%.
   Secondary organic carbon constituted most of the carbonaceous particles
   found in the park, commercial, industrial and residential areas, with
   the exception of hospitals. The high PM and EC concentrations in
   hospitals were primarily caused by vehicle emissions. Thus, the results
   suggest that long-term plans should be to limit the number of vehicles
   entering hospital campuses, construct large-capacity underground parking
   structures, and choose hospital locations far from major roads.}},

Abstract = {{The efficient planning of site space through the course of a
   construction project is referred to as site layout planning. Due to its
   impact on safety, productivity and security on construction sites,
   several site layout planning models have been developed in the past
   decades. These models have the common aim of generating best layouts
   considering the defined constraints and conditions. However, the
   underlying assumptions that were made during the development of these
   models seem disparate and often implicit. This study provides an
   overview of the existing models and aims to draw a holistic view of
   variables that have been considered at different levels of detail and
   using different approaches in the site layout literature. Through close
   examination and comparative analysis of existing models, this study
   identifies the components that need to be considered for site layout
   modeling, referred to as constructs. Possible approaches that can be
   used to realize each construct are presented, and the advantages and
   disadvantages of these approaches are discussed. It is hoped that this
   study contributes to a better understanding of site layout modeling, and
   provide an outline for the development of new site layout planning
   models.}},

Title = {{Mass balance monitoring of geological CO2 storage with a superconducting
   gravimeter - A case study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{114}},
Pages = {{244-250}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Although monitoring of geological carbon dioxide (CO2) storage is
   possible with a number of geophysical and geodetic techniques (e.g.,
   seismic survey), gravimetric monitoring is known to be the most accurate
   method for measuring total mass changes. Therefore, it can be used for
   detection of storage pore space content changes and migration of CO2
   plumes. A superconducting gravimeter (SG) installed on the Earth's
   surface provides precise and continuous records of gravity variations
   over time for periods from minutes to decades, which are required for
   monitoring subsurface CO2 storage. Due to the fact that gravimeter
   records combine the gravity effects of surface displacement and
   subsurface mass change, these two effects must be separated properly for
   observing CO2 mass balance. The Newtonian attraction gravity effect of
   stored CO2 is modeled as a function of reservoir depth and CO2 mass for
   different locations of the gravimeter over the reservoir. The gravity
   effect of the surface deformation is considered according to the modeled
   and measured displacement above the CO2 reservoir at the gravimeter's
   position. For estimation of the detection threshold, an assessment is
   carried out for the gravity corrections, which must be subtracted from
   the raw gravity data before obtaining the gravity signal of the stored
   CO2. A CO2 signal larger than about 0.51.1Gal can be detected with an
   SG's continuous recordings. A measured gravity profile along the
   reservoir can support the continuous measurements. For providing
   objective evidence of a CO2 stored gravity signal, real measured raw SG
   gravity data of the MunGyung site in Korea were superimposed with an
   artificial uniformly continuous gravity signal up to 1.7 mu Cal,
   representing a gravity signal from a CO2 storage site with increasing
   injections up to about 105 kt at a depth of 600 m. These data were
   analyzed, and the CO2 storage signal could be clearly identified. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a nonlinear dynamic model to study spatial and
   temporal dynamics of epidemics of susceptible-infected-removed type. It
   involves modeling the respective collections of epidemic states and
   syndromic observations as random finite sets. Each epidemic state
   consists of the number of infected individuals in an isolated population
   system and the corresponding partially known parameters of the epidemic
   model. The infectious disease could spread between population systems
   with known probabilities based on prior knowledge of ecological and
   biological features of the environment. The problem is then formulated
   in the context of Bayesian framework and estimated via a probability
   hypothesis density filter. Each population system under surveillance is
   assumed to be homogenous and fixed, with daily reports on the number of
   infected people available for monitoring and prediction. When model
   parameters are partially known, results of numerical studies indicate
   that the proposed approach can help early prediction of the epidemic in

Abstract = {{The ability to accurately predict the solubility of CO2 in bitumen is
   essential to the design of bitumen and heavy oil recovery processes. We
   applied the cubic-plus-association equation of state (CPA-EoS) to
   calculate the solubility of CO2 in bitumen and the Soave-Redlich-Kwong
   (SRK) equation of state was applied to treat the physical molecular
   interactions. The proposed thermodynamic model was verified against the
   experimental data for CO2 solubility in bitumen over wide ranges of
   temperature and pressure for four different bitumens from Alberta
   reservoirs. The CPA-EoS was able to predict the solubility with less
   deviation from the experimental data than the regular cubic equations of
   state and the statistical association fluid theory (SAFT). Our results
   suggest that the CPA-EoS is an effective method of conducting solubility
   calculations for solvent assisted bitumen recovery processes. (C) 2015

Title = {{Bone quality in osteopenic postmenopausal women is not improved after 12
   months of whole-body vibration training}},
Journal = {{OSTEOPOROSIS INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Whole-body vibration training may improve bone quality through
   structural adaptation. We tested if 12 months of training affects bone
   structure in osteopenic postmenopausal women by using advanced
   3-dimensional high-resolution imaging techniques. We found that
   whole-body vibration training did not improve bone structure compared to
   inactive controls.
   Introduction Whole-body vibration training (WBVT) has been suggested as
   a preventive measure against bone loss. Contradicting results of
   previous studies may be confounded by insufficiently sensitive bone
   density measures to detect relevant bone changes. WBVT may improve bone
   quality through structural adaptations, without increasing bone mineral
   density (BMD). We hypothesized that 12 months of WBVT will improve or
   maintain bone microarchitecture and bone strength in osteopenic
   postmenopausal women.
   Methods Twenty-two women received WBVT for 2-3 sessions/week and were
   compared with 20 controls. Bone outcomes were measured by
   high-resolution peripheral quantitative CT (HR-pQCT, XtremeCT, Scanco
   Medical) and finite element estimated bone strength. Balance and jump
   performance and maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) of knee flexor and
   extensor muscles were recorded. All measurements were taken at baseline,
   4, 8, and 12 months and a reduced data set at 4 and 8 months follow-up
   and compared using a mixed model repeated measures ANOVA.
   Results Thirty-one women completed the study with 90 \% compliance
   (WBVT: n = 17, control n = 14). Total BMD (p < 0.001), cortical
   area{*}(p = 0.004), cortical thickness (p = 0.011), and cortical
   porosity (p = 0.024) all significantly decreased over time in both
   groups; WBVT did not affect the response. All other bone outcomes were
   not affected by WBVT or time. No difference in measures of balance, jump
   height, and MVC due to WBVT were detected.
   Conclusion In our cohort, WBVT did not lead to improved bone quality in
   postmenopausal osteopenic women after 12 months of training compared to
   controls, and there were no detected benefits related to balance and
   muscle strength outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Thermo-physical properties including densities and viscosities of
   bio-oil itself and its two fractions (aqueous fraction and organic
   fraction) are important for practical utilization. In this study, the
   bio-oil fractions were prepared in various weight ratios of 2:1, 1:1,
   and 1:2. Density and viscosity of a bio-oil itself, and its aqueous and
   organic fractions were accurately measured at various temperatures
   varying from ambient to 343K and pressures from ambient to 10MPa.
   Increasing temperature decreased the density of bio-oil itself and the
   two separated phases (aqueous and organic phases) by almost 2.5\%, and
   0.3 to 0.4\%, respectively. Increasing the temperature also decreased
   the viscosity of the bio-oil by almost 86\% and its aqueous and organic
   fractions by up to 68\% and 98\%, respectively. The density of the
   bio-oil and its organic and aqueous fractions was enhanced by increasing
   the pressure, whereas increasing the pressure increased the viscosity of
   bio-oil and the organic fraction, but not the viscosity of aqueous
   phase. The generated experimental density and viscosity data of bio-oil
   and its aqueous and organic fractions were evaluated with existing
   models that account for the effects of temperature and pressure. The
   impacts of pressure and temperature on the density and viscosity were
   considered in the correlations and evaluated with the experimental
   results.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{767}},
Pages = {{323-341}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A perching bird is able to rapidly decelerate while maintaining lift and
   control, but the underlying aerodynamic mechanism is poorly understood.
   In this work we perform a study on a simultaneously decelerating and
   pitching aerofoil section to increase our understanding of the unsteady
   aerodynamics of perching. We first explore the problem analytically,
   developing expressions for the added-mass and circulatory forces arising
   from boundary-layer separation on a flat-plate aerofoil. Next, we study
   the model problem through a detailed series of experiments at Re = 22
   000 and two-dimensional simulations at Re = 2000. Simulated vorticity
   fields agree with particle image velocimetry measurements, showing the
   same wake features and vorticity magnitudes. Peak lift and drag forces
   during rapid perching are measured to be more than 10 times the
   quasi-steady values. The majority of these forces can be attributed to
   added-mass energy transfer between the fluid and aerofoil, and to energy
   lost to the fluid by flow separation at the leading and trailing edges.
   Thus, despite the large angles of attack and decreasing flow velocity,
   this simple pitch-up manoeuvre provides a means through which a perching
   bird can maintain high lift and drag simultaneously while slowing to a
   controlled stop.}},

Abstract = {{The recovery of heavy oil and oil sand deposits of western Canada by
   using in situ combustion or gasification recovery processes has always
   been a great technological and economical challenge. During in situ
   combustion bitumen recovery processes, pyrolysis, aquathermolysis and
   oxidation mechanisms coexist because of co-existence of bitumen, water
   and oxygen in the presence of high temperature and high pressure. The
   modeling of such processes requires comprehensive reaction schemes along
   with kinetic parameters to describe each of these mechanisms. The
   determination of such kinetic parameters requires extensive lab and/or
   pilot studies due to the complex chemical nature of bitumen. During
   these studies, it is customary to represent bitumen and products of
   bitumen combustion by pseudo-components to describe the bitumen
   combustion reaction scheme in a way which not only describes the process
   reasonably well but also is easy to understand. Although there have been
   numerous bitumen combustion experiments conducted over the past 80 +
   years, all of the data and experience have not been analyzed
   comprehensively with a focus towards integrating all of the evidence
   into a single vision of the process. Here, we review all previously
   published lab scale and pilot experimental data, various reaction
   schemes and field observations published for pyrolysis, aquathermolysis,
   oxidation, and/or gasification of Athabasca bitumen. These studies were
   conducted either to understand the chemical structure of bitumen or to
   develop reaction schemes for use in numerical simulators. This review
   reveals a new overall vision for combustion processes for in situ
   bitumen recovery and also shows that there are key data sets not
   currently available that would greatly enhance modeling and simulation
   work needed for the full recovery of Athabasca bitumen resources. (C)

Abstract = {{A study, entitled ``Wabamun Lake Sequestration Project{''} or
   ``WASP,{''} was performed to evaluate large-scale CO2 storage
   opportunities in the Wabamun area including potential risks. The project
   examined the feasibility of storing 20 megatons (Mt) of CO2 per year
   over 50 years. This scale is one order of magnitude larger than the
   typical benchmark (1 Mt/year) used in academic research and commercial
   projects that are currently in place or under review. The study was
   conducted by a group of researchers from several universities as well as
   industry consultants. This study presents an overview of the reservoir
   modeling part of this study, which the authors were responsible for. The
   main objectives of the reservoir modeling for WASP project were as
   follows: (1) estimation of storage capacity (traditionally, this value
   is projected based on the available pore space, but we have an
   additional practical consideration: the maximum amount one can inject
   within short period of time {[}similar to 50 years] and within a
   localized injection area {[}similar to 30 km x 90 km]); (2)
   investigation of CO2 plume movement and pressure distribution during and
   after injection including the effect of formation dip angle on the plume
   shape and its migration; (3) investigation of the long-term fate of
   injection associated with free phase CO2 (risks of leakage) and aquifer
   pressurization (possible geomechanical changes and related phenomena);
   (4) investigation of the phase behavior of H2S initially available and
   dissolved in brine during CO2 sequestration process. The WASP reservoir
   modeling study mentioned above led to a few important findings. The most
   important one is that, when CO2 is being injected into a sour aquifer,
   initially dissolved H2S will release into the expanding CO2 plume and
   accumulate at the leading edge of the plume. Also, the large-scale
   injection scheme (20 Mt/year), which requires multi well injectors,
   provides very different pressure response compared to a one well (1
   Mt/year) scenario.}},

Abstract = {{Performance of a Fuzzy logic controller is dependent on sufficient and
   accurate knowledge base. As the number of rules in a knowledge base
   increases, its complexity increases which in turn affects the
   computation time and memory requirements. To overcome these problems, a
   Polar Fuzzy logic controller is proposed. The aim of the Polar Fuzzy
   Controller (PFC) is to restore the frequency and tie-line power in a
   smooth way to its nominal value in the shortest possible time if any
   load disturbance is applied to any area of power system. In this paper,
   the PFC is made adaptive using a Genetic algorithm-fuzzy system (GAF)
   approach. Performance of the simple PFC and adaptive PFC using GAF is
   compared with fuzzy and conventional PI controllers on a three area

Abstract = {{Thin, low Platinum loading polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC)
   electrodes fabricated by inkjet printing are investigated. Catalyst
   coated membranes (CCMs) with Pt loading of 0.026mg(Pt)/cm(2), catalyst
   layer thickness between 1.5 and 2 mu m and varying Nafion loadings (NL)
   on the cathode electrodes of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 wt\% are analyzed.
   Ex-situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) visualization shows that the
   layers are porous and composed of Pt/C aggregates binded by ionomer.
   In-situ electrochemical testing shows that the Tafel slope of these
   electrodes is relatively large, i.e., 120 mV/dec. Further, at 80 degrees
   C and varying relative humidities, the CCMs are not sensitive to Nafion
   loading changes within the 20 wt\% 40 wt\% range. Proton transport
   limitations are only observed at low NL of 10 wt\% while transport
   losses are only observed at high currents for CCM with 50 wt\% NL.
   Comparing conventional and thin, low loading, inkjet printed electrodes,
   the inkjet printed electrodes show a much higher sensitivity to oxygen
   partial pressures. These results suggest that macro-scale oxygen and
   proton transport are not limiting the electrode at the 20 wt\% - 40 wt\%
   Nafion range. Pt mass activity for the inkjet CCM at ambient pressure
   was observed to be 196 A/mgPt (12.4kW g(Pt)(-1)), i.e., 10 times higher
   than a spray coated CCM, due to its reduced CL thickness and thereby
   reduced transport losses in the macro-scale. The Pt utilization at 2 bar
   gauge pressure is 47.6kW g(Pt)(-1) and represents one of the highest
   utilization values reported for low Pt loading electrodes. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Thick haze plagued northeastern China in January 2013, strongly
   affecting both regional climate and human respiratory health. Here, we
   present dual carbon isotope constrained (Delta C-14 and delta C-13)
   source apportionment for combustion-derived black carbon aerosol (BC)
   for three key hotspot regions (megacities): North China Plain (NCP,
   Beijing), the Yangtze River Delta (YRD, Shanghai), and the Pearl River
   Delta (PRD, Guangzhou) for January 2013. BC, here quantified as
   elemental carbon (EC), is one of the most health-detrimental components
   of PM2.5 and a strong climate warming agent. The results show that these
   severe haze events were equally affected (similar to 30\%) by biomass
   combustion in all three regions, whereas the sources of the dominant
   fossil fuel component was dramatically different between north and
   south. In the NCP region, coal combustion accounted for 66\% (46-74\%,
   95\% C.I.) of the EC, whereas, in the YRD and PRD regions, liquid fossil
   fuel combustion (e.g., traffic) stood for 46\% (18-66\%) and 58\%
   (38-68\%), respectively. Taken together, these findings suggest the need
   for a regionally-specific description of BC sources in climate models
   and regionally-tailored mitigation to combat severe air pollution events

Abstract = {{The presence of fine solids and dissolved organics in produced water

   Ceramic membranes in tubular configurations with pore sizes of 20 kDa,

   dissolved organics from boiler feed water (BFW). The original BFW sample
   contained 125, 1300 and 20 mg/L of oil and grease (O\&G), naphthenic
   acids (NAs) and total suspended solids (TSS), respectively. It was found
   that lowering the pH of the BFW to 4 prior to membrane treatment
   increased the permeate flux and also eliminated operating drawbacks such
   as foam formation. Among all the investigated membranes, the Al2O3
   membrane with 100 nm pore size showed the best performance in terms of
   flux and removal efficiencies as no detection of total suspended solids
   was observed in the permeate streams while achieving a high removal

Abstract = {{Water contamination by organic compounds is a ubiquitous problem,
   requiring their removal to meet stringent water quality standards. This
   paper presents for the first time the life cycle environmental impacts
   and economic costs of a new water treatment technology for removal of
   organic compounds known as the `Arvia' process. The impacts and costs
   are compared with the widely-used granulated activated carbon (GAC)
   process. Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been used to estimate the
   environmental impacts and the economic analysis is based on the
   operating costs. For the GAC system, two scenarios are considered: no
   regeneration of the spent GAC which is landfilled (GAC-1) and 90\%
   regeneration with 10\% of fresh GAC added to replace losses (GAC-2). The
   LCA results suggest that the Arvia process has lower environmental
   impacts in comparison to both GAC scenarios for at least seven out of 11
   impacts considered. Relative to the GAC-1 scenario, Arvia has 70\% lower
   global warming, acidification, eutrophication, depletion of fossil
   resources, human, freshwater and marine toxicity. Compared to GAC-2, the
   reductions in these impacts range between 5\% and 50\%. However, GAC-2
   has lower depletion of elements and ozone layer, photochemical smog and
   terrestrial toxicity than the Arvia process. The results also show that
   Arvia has slightly higher operational costs than GAC-2 but significantly
   lower than GAC-1. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Magnesium-air (Mg-air) batteries are an important energy source used to
   power electronic equipment and automobiles. Metal-air batteries give
   more energy density due to surplus air involved in reduction reaction at
   air cathode. In this study, the scope of improvements in the efficiency
   of Metal-air batteries is investigated through addition of water soluble
   graphene (WSG) as inhibitor in NaCl electrolyte. The discharge
   performance, corrosion behaviour and electrochemical impedance are
   studied for (i) the conventional Mg-air battery using 3.5\% NaCl and
   (ii) Mg-air battery with WSG-based 3.5\% NaCl electrolyte. X-ray
   diffraction analysis for WSG is carried out and it shows the crystalline
   nature of WSG by an intense sharp peak at 26.3. Scanning electron
   microscope study is also performed and shows the flake-like structure of
   WSG denoted by thin layers of carbon. The immersion of WSG in 3.5\% NaCl

Abstract = {{A plasmon-assisted fluoro-immunoassay (PAFI) was developed for the
   detection of the influenza virus by using Au nanoparticle (Au
   NP)-decorated carbon nanotubes (AuCNTs) that were synthesized using
   phytochemical composites at room temperature in deionized water.
   Specific antibodies (Abs) against the influenza virus were conjugated
   onto the surface of AuCNTs and cadmium telluride quantum dots (QDs),
   which had a photoluminescence intensity that varied as a function of
   virus concentration and a detection limit of 0.1 pg/mL for all three
   types of influenza viruses examined. The clinically isolated influenza
   viruses (A/Yokohama/110/2009 (H3N2)) were detected in the range of
   50-10,000 PFU/mL, with a detection limit of 50 PFU/mL. From a series of
   proof-of-concept and clinical experiments, the developed PAFI biosensing
   system provided robust signal production and enhancement, as well as an
   excellent selectivity and sensitivity for influenza viruses. This
   nanoparticle-based technique could be potentially developed as an
   efficient detection platform for the influenza virus. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Multiuser multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division
   multiple access (MIMO-OFDMA) is considered as the practical method to
   attain the capacity promised by multiple antennas in the downlink
   direction. However, the joint calculation of precoding/beamforming and
   resource allocation required by the optimal algorithms is
   computationally prohibitive. This paper proposes computationally
   efficient resource allocation algorithms that can be invoked after the
   precoding and beamforming operations. To support stringent and diverse
   quality of service requirements, previous works have shown that the
   resource allocation algorithm must be able to guarantee a specific data
   rate to each user. The constraint matrix defined by the resource
   allocation problem with these data rate constraints provides a special
   structure that lends to efficient solution of the problem. On the basis
   of the standard graph theory and the Lagrangian relaxation, we develop
   an optimal resource allocation algorithm that exploits this structure to
   reduce the required execution time. Moreover, a lower-complexity
   suboptimal algorithm is introduced. Extensive simulations are conducted
   to evaluate the computational and system-level performance. It is shown
   that the proposed resource allocation algorithms attain the optimal
   solution at a much lower computational overhead compared with
   general-purpose optimization algorithms used by previous MIMO-OFDMA
   resource allocation approaches. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons,

   external oscillatory flow}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 2}},
Abstract = {{We report on two-dimensional simulations of liquid bridges' dynamics
   inside microchannels of uniform wettability and subject to an external
   oscillatory flow rate. The oscillatory flow results in a zero net flow
   rate and its effects are compared to those of a stationary system. To
   handle the three phase contact lines motion, Cahn-Hilliard
   diffuse-interface formulation was used and the flow equations were
   solved using the finite element method with adaptively refined
   unstructured grids. The results indicate that the liquid bridge responds
   in three different ways depending on the substrate wettability
   properties and the frequency of the oscillatory flow. In particular
   below a critical frequency, the liquid bridge will rupture when the
   channel walls are philic or detach from the surface when they are
   phobic. However, at high frequencies, the liquid bridge shows a
   perpetual periodic oscillatory motion for both philic and phobic
   surfaces. Furthermore, an increase in the frequency of the flow velocity
   results in stabilization effects and a behavior approaching that of the
   stationary system where no rupture or detachment can be observed. This
   stable behavior is the direct result of less deformation of the liquid
   bridge due to the fast flow direction change and motion of contact lines
   on the solid substrate. Moreover, it was found that the flow velocity is
   out of phase with the footprint and throat lengths and that the latter
   two also show a phase difference. These differences were explained in
   terms of the motion of the two contact lines on the solid substrates and
   the deformation of the two fluid-fluid interfaces.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of the present work was to functionalize nanoclays
   with organosilanes and surfactant in order to facilitate the dispersion
   of the nanofillers in the host fluoroelastomer (FKM) polymer matrix.
   Better dispersion was achieved by improving interaction between the clay
   polymer nanocomposite (CPN) constituents. The first part of this study
   investigated modification of montmorillonite (Mnt) using different
   saturated and unsaturated alkyl silanes and an alkyl hydrocarbon
   ammonium quaternary surfactant. Silicon magic angle spinning nuclear
   magnetic resonance spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA),
   elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy were used to characterize the silane-grafted
   clays. Results indicated that the amount of silane grafted depended on
   the specific structure of the silane. Silane-grafted Mnt was also
   modified with ionic surfactants intercalated between the clay layers. A
   169\% increase in the clay basal spacing (from initial spacing of 10.0
   angstrom to 26.9 angstrom) was achieved. The second part. of the study
   successfully synthesized FKM nanocomposites containing
   custom-functionalized Mnt, with the aim of producing reinforced
   high-performance materials. The effects of clay modification on the
   morphology and thermal properties of the CPN were studied using XRD,
   TGA, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy.
   The CPN made with the modified clay exhibited greater thermal stability
   than the CPN of the commercially available modified Mnt, with a
   degradation onset point similar to 40 degrees C higher.}},

Title = {{A Semianalytical Forecasting Method for Unconventional Gas and Light Oil
   Wells: A Hybrid Approach for Addressing the Limitations of Existing
   Empirical and Analytical Methods}},
Journal = {{SPE RESERVOIR EVALUATION \& ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{94-110}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The rapid pace of exploitation of unconventional gas and light oil plays
   in North America has necessitated the development of new
   production-forecasting methodologies to aid in reserves assessment,
   capital planning, and field optimization. The generation of defendable
   forecasts is challenged not only by reservoir complexities but also by
   the use of multifractured horizontal wells (MFHWs) for development.
   In this work, a semianalytical method (SAM) is developed to provide a
   solid theoretical basis for forecasting. The technique is analytical in
   that it uses the methods of Agarwal (2010) to calculate contacted oil in
   place and contacted gas in place (COIP/ CGIP) from production rates,
   flowing pressures, and fluid properties. The rate-normalized pressure
   (RNP) derivative (RNP0) is a key component of the calculation;
   pseudopressure is used for gas cases. The technique is also empirical in
   that an empirical function is fitted to the resulting COIP/CGIP curve
   vs. time. Although the method is flexible enough that any equation can
   be used to represent the COIP/CGIP curve, and hence, the sequence of
   flow regimes exhibited by MFHWs, the equation must be capable of being
   integrated to allow the extraction of RNP. The stabilized COIP/CGIP
   during boundary-dominated flow (BDF) must be specified for
   forecasting-thereafter, the method uses a material-balance simulator to
   model BDF. Hence, if the well is still in transient flow, a range in
   forecasts may be generated, depending on the assumed stabilized
   COIP/CGIP.
   The new SAM addresses some of the current limitations of empirical and
   fully analytical (modeling) approaches. Empirical methods, which have
   been adapted to account for long transient and transitional flow periods
   associated with ultralow-permeability reservoirs, lack a theoretical
   basis, and therefore input parameters may be difficult to constrain.
   However, empirical methods are simple to apply and require a minimum
   amount of data for forecasting. Analytical models, while representing
   the physics better, nonetheless require additional reservoir and
   hydraulic-fracture data that may not be available on every well in the
   field. The SAM proposed herein is intended to bridge the gap between
   empirical and modeling-based approaches-it is more rigorous than purely
   empirical methods, while requiring a lesser amount of data than fully
   analytical techniques.
   The new method is tested against simulated and field cases (tight oil
   and shale gas). Although a simple power-law function is used in the
   current work to represent the COIP/OGIP curve, which appears adequate
   for the cases studied, one should note that wells exhibiting long
   transitional flow periods (e.g., elliptical/ radial) will likely require
   a different functional form.}},

   communities in Twitter in disaster situations. For this purpose, we have
   enhanced the fast-greedy optimization of modularity (FGM) clustering
   algorithm with semantic similarity so that it can deal with the complex
   social graphs extracted from Twitter. Then, we have coupled the enhanced
   FGM with the varied density-based spatial clustering of applications
   with noise spatial clustering algorithm to obtain spatial clusters at
   different temporal snapshots. The method was experimented with a case
   study on typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, and Twitter's different
   interaction modes were compared to create the graph of users and to
   detect communities. The experiments show that communities that are
   relevant to identify areas where disaster-related incidents were
   reported can be extracted, and that the enhanced algorithm outperforms
   the generic one in this task.}},

Abstract = {{The formation and dissociation of methane hydrate within sediment can
   lead to large changes in wave velocities, which provide valuable
   insights into the processes involved in hydrate formation. These are of
   practical importance in geophysical characterization, as well as
   developing strategies for the future exploitation of methane hydrates.
   This paper presents changes in wave velocity, measured during hydrate
   formation, and subsequent dissociation, using the resonant column
   apparatus. Hydrate was formed under drained and undrained conditions.
   Drained specimens had free access to methane during formation, while for
   undrained specimens, methane content was fixed. Hydrate formation and
   dissociation were induced by changing the specimen temperature under
   constant effective stress. In excess of 20 determinations of shear wave
   and flexural wave velocity were carried out over a 9h period, both
   during hydrate formation and dissociation. This time was sufficient to
   record almost all of the changes in wave velocity within a specimen. The
   exothermic nature of hydrate formation was clearly seen in the form of
   spikes in temperature measured at the base of the specimens. For all
   specimens, the relationship between wave velocity and degree of hydrate
   saturation was nonlinear and significantly different during formation
   and dissociation. The patterns observed suggest that hydrate morphology
   not only is important in controlling the ultimate wave velocities, at
   the end of formation, but has a significant impact on the rates of
   change of wave velocities during formation and dissociation. A
   conceptual model is presented to explain differences in observed
   behavior during formation and dissociation.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper is concerned with the analysis of microstructural
   instabilities in granular materials and with their relation to both
   macroscopic localized and diffuse failure modes. A discrete-element
   (DEM) computer simulation of deformations in an idealized
   two-dimensional frictional particle assembly subject to various biaxial
   loadings notably drained compression and proportional strain paths is
   proposed as a prototype model to investigate the underlying physics of
   material failure. Based on the transfer of the second-order work
   criterion to the microscopic level, we seek for contacts tagged as c(-)
   within the granular assembly that undergo instabilities during loading
   history. The DEM computations yield a description of failure as a
   microstructural self-organization process by which c(-) contacts
   aggregate into clusters which can either grow or breakdown as the
   network of contacts adjusts itself to externally applied loads during
   deformation history. It is proposed here that there is a close relation
   between the clustering of c(-) contacts and the resulting failure mode
   based on cluster size and spatial distribution. Localized deformations
   are found to correlate well with sustained growth of the above clusters,
   while diffuse failure has more to do with smaller clusters experiencing
   suppressed development A comprehensive statistical analysis on the
   clusters lends support to this conclusion. (C) 2015 Academie des

Abstract = {{The solids deposition from one-phase and two-phase waxy mixtures
   (comprising a multicomponent paraffinic wax dissolved in a
   multicomponent solvent, and water) was studied using a cold finger
   experimental apparatus. The deposition experiments were performed with a
   10 mass \% wax solution, containing 0, 10, 20, and 30 vol \% water, with
   two different rates of agitation, and for nine different deposition
   times ranging from 30 s to 24 h. The water content of the deposit was
   found to be not related to the water content of the waxy mixture. The
   short-duration experiments showed the deposition process to be very
   fast, with more than half of the deposition process completed in 30 s.
   Following a rapid rate of deposition initially, the deposit mass was
   observed to increase slowly to reach steady state at about 12 h. The
   deposit mass decreased with an increase in the agitation speed. The
   deposition data were modeled satisfactorily with a steady-state
   heat-transfer model and an unsteady-state model based on the moving
   boundary problem formulation. The results confirmed the liquiddeposit
   interface temperature to be equal to the wax appearance temperature
   (WAT) of the wax solution throughout the deposition process, i.e., for
   all deposition times. The results of this study provide further
   confirmation that the solids deposition process can be described
   adequately with an approach based solely on heat-transfer
   considerations.}},

Abstract = {{This is the second of two articles with the main, and largely

   This article considers rotors with finite number of blades and is

   ``Momentum theories{''}, assessed the starring role of Joukowsky in
   aerodynamics in the historical context of rotor theory. The main focus
   in both articles is on wind turbine rotors, but much of the basic theory
   applies to propellers and helicopters as well. Thus this second article
   concentrates on the so-called blade element theory, the Kutta-Joukowsky
   theorem, and the development of the rotor vortex theory of Joukowsky.
   This article is to a large extent based on our own work, which
   constitutes the first successful completion and further development of
   Joukowsky's work by deriving the first analytical solution of his rotor.
   This rotor has a finite number of blades and will be compared with the
   rotor analysis of Betz and of others of the German school of

Title = {{Two-phase convective mixing under a buoyant plume of CO2 in deep saline
   aquifers}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{76}},
Pages = {{55-71}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) in deep saline aquifers has been
   suggested as a promising method for stabilizing the atmospheric
   concentration of CO2. An accurate evaluation of the CO2 trapping
   mechanisms, such as convective mixing, is crucial for estimates of
   storage capacity and security. We recently investigated the
   gravitational stability of the diffusive boundary layer underneath a
   capillary transition zone by performing a linear stability analysis,
   which provides a quantitative description of the onset of convection for
   the two-phase, buoyancy-driven flow in the presence of the capillary
   transition zone (Emami-Meybodi and Hassanzadeh, 2013). In this paper, we
   further examine the effect of the capillary transition zone on the onset
   of convection and subsequent convective mixing using direct numerical
   simulations. We describe key features of the two-phase convective mixing
   for systems with low Rayleigh numbers (Ra <= 1000) and the measurement
   of several global quantities, such as the total CO2 dissolution,
   Sherwood number, swelling factor, and interface velocity. We show that
   the commonly used assumption of a sharp CO2-brine interface with
   constant CO2 concentration at the top of an aquifer (i.e. single-phase
   system) may lead to erroneous estimates of not only the onset of
   convection, but also of the rate and magnitude of CO2 dissolution. The
   significant effect of the capillary transition zone on the dissolution
   of CO2 under a buoyant plume in saline aquifers is explained; and, the
   link between the capillary transition zone and the volume change, due to
   CO2 dissolution and the interface velocity over the mixing process, is
   demonstrated. Compared to the single-phase system, a crossflow through
   the interface of the diffusive boundary layer with the capillary
   transition zone, as well as the upward advance of the interface motion,
   may enhance the convective mixing early in the period of natural
   convection. The decrease in the onset time and stronger mass flux may be
   more profound in the two-phase system than in the previously reported
   single-phase models. Furthermore, we report several scaling
   relationships that characterize the mixing process in the presence of
   the capillary transition zone. Our findings provide further insight into
   the understanding of the two-phase mixing features and the long-term
   fate of the injected CO2 in deep saline aquifers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{110}},
Pages = {{38-46}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In the majority of fatal snow avalanches, skiers and snowmobilers
   trigger the avalanche by applying load to the snow cover. The snow cover
   is often tested to learn information about its stability on surrounding
   slopes. This testing is normally performed by digging down into the snow
   cover, isolating a column of snow, dynamically loading the top of the
   column and observing fractures that occur in the column due to the
   loading. Understanding how stress from dynamic surface loads and from
   loading in common stability tests transmit through the snow cover can
   help people avoid situations in which they can trigger avalanches.
   Capacitive sensors were used within the mountain snow cover to measure
   peak stress below dynamic surface loads and in common stability tests.
   The sensors were used on 21 field days to collect over 1,605
   measurements. We present measured stress data illustrating the effect of
   isolating a column in stability tests compared to skiing and
   snowmobiling over a largely undisturbed snow cover. We observed that
   adjusting the depth of stability tests to account for the penetration
   depth of snowmobiles loads the snow cover more similarly to the loading
   applied by snowmobiling. We found that the stress profile in stability
   tests more closely matched skiing and snowmobiling when the snow cover
   was softer compared to when the snow cover was harder. Similarly, the
   differences between the skier and snowmobile loading compared to the
   stability test loading were increased for a harder snow cover. Finally,
   in the Extended Column Test, a modern stability test, stress was only
   measured directly below the loading and not on the opposite side of the
   column. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Managing inventory and service levels in a capacitated supply chain
   environment with seasonal demand requires appropriate selection and
   readjustment of replenishment decision variables. This study focuses on
   the dynamic adjustment of decision variables within supply chains using
   continuous-review reorder point (ROP) replenishment. A framework is
   proposed to adjust reorder points and lot sizes based on optimal
   settings within different regions of a seasonal demand cycle. This
   framework also includes the optimal timing of adjustments defining these
   regions. A discrete-event simulation model of a simple,
   capacity-constrained supply chain is developed and simulation
   optimization experiments are performed, the objective being to minimize
   the total supply chain inventory subject to a target delivery service
   level. The performance of ROP systems with optimal static and optimal
   dynamic decision variable settings are compared using two different
   seasonal demand patterns. The results confirm that performance with
   dynamic decision variable adjustment is better. For a given delivery
   service level, average work-in-process inventory levels are almost the
   same for both systems. However average finished goods inventory levels
   decrease significantly and are more stable under dynamic adjustment. The
   practical implication is that both finished goods holding costs and
   maximum storage capacity requirements are reduced. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Journal = {{EXPERIMENTS IN FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The influence of the turbulent boundary thickness on the vortex dynamics
   in the wake of a wall-mounted rectangular cylinder (height-to-width
   ratio h/d = 4) is investigated experimentally for a Reynolds number of
   12,000 and two boundary layers (BL) of thickness /d = 0.72 (natural BL)
   and 2.56 (tripped BL). The interaction between the horseshoe vortex
   system (HVS) and the shedding of large-scale wake structures is
   considered. Time-resolved PIV measurements are performed in the
   wall-obstacle junction region. New insight into the physics of these
   flows is gained from studying the spatio-temporal evolution of the
   vortical structures and their interaction. It is found that delta/d
   plays an important role in modifying the flow topology around the
   rectangular cylinder through the interaction between the horseshoe
   vortices and shed vortices. A proper orthogonal decomposition analysis
   shows that the dynamics of the HVS strongly affects the topology of the
   shed vortices near the wall for the tripped boundary layer. Both the
   backflow and the zero-flow modes of the HVS have particular influence on
   the symmetry of the horseshoe legs and its momentum content. A stronger
   effect of the HVS is present for the tripped BL close to the wall where
   the kinetic energy content of these two modes is higher as compared to
   the natural BL.}},

Journal = {{EXPERIMENTS IN FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{56}},

Abstract = {{A novel technique is described for pressure extraction from Lagrangian
   particle-tracking data. The technique uses a Poisson solver to extract
   the pressure field on a network of data nodes, which is constructed
   using the Voronoi tessellation and the Delaunay triangulation. The
   technique is demonstrated on two cases: synthetic Lagrangian data
   generated for the analytical case of Hill's spherical vortex, and the
   flow in the wake behind a NACA 0012 which was impulsively accelerated to
   Re = 7,500. The experimental data were collected using four-camera,
   three-dimensional particle-tracking velocimetry. For both the analytical
   case and the experimental case, the dependence of pressure-field error
   or sensitivity on the normalized spatial particle density was found to
   follow similar powerlaw relationships. It was shown that in order to
   resolve the salient flow structures from experimental data, the required
   particle density was an order of magnitude greater than for the
   analytical case. Furthermore, additional sub-structures continued to be
   identified in the experimental data as the particle density was
   increased. The increased density requirements of the experimental data
   were assumed to be due to a combination of phase-averaging error and the
   presence of turbulent coherent structures in the flow. Additionally, the
   computational requirements of the technique were assessed. It was found
   that in the current implementation, the computational requirements are
   slightly nonlinear with respect to the number of particles. However, the
   technique will remain feasible even as advancements in particle-tracking
   techniques in the future increase the density of Lagrangian data.}},

Abstract = {{A significant portion of our knowledge on gas hydrate-bearing sands
   comes from experimental results on laboratory-synthesized specimens. The
   failure mechanics are often interpreted using components of the
   stress-strain curves, which capture the specimens global (large-scale)
   response to shear. In this paper, we postulate on the microscale
   mechanics, which lead to a variety of interesting global behaviors. Two
   mechanisms of failure during shear are postulated: one involves
   debonding of the hydrate particle from the soil solid, and the other
   involves crushing or breakage through the hydrate itself. Both modes of
   failure lead to similar peak strengths, which arise from both friction
   and apparent cohesion induced by the hydrate bonding; however, the
   differences observed in postpeak softening may be attributed to the
   different failure mechanisms. Global specimen responses such as sudden
   strength loss, occurrence of double shear banding, and differences in
   postpeak behavior are manifestations of the microscale hydrate sand
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{High-speed dual fluoroscopy is a noninvasive imaging technology for
   three-dimensional skeletal kinematics analysis that finds numerous
   biomechanical applications. Accurate reconstruction of bone translations
   and rotations from dual-fluoroscopic data requires accurate calibration
   of the imaging geometry and the many imaging distortions that corrupt
   the data. Direct linear transformation methods are commonly applied for
   performing calibration using a two-step process that suffers from a
   number of potential shortcomings including that each X-ray source and
   corresponding camera must be calibrated separately. Consequently, the
   true imaging set-up and the constraints it presents are not incorporated
   during calibration. A method to overcome such drawbacks is the
   single-step self-calibrating bundle adjustment method. This procedure,
   based on the collinearity principle augmented with imaging distortion
   models and geometric constraints, has been developed and is reported
   herein. Its efficacy is shown with a carefully controlled experiment
   comprising 300 image pairs with 48 507 image points. Application of all
   geometric constraints and a 31 parameter distortion model resulted in up
   to 91\% improvement in terms of precision (model fit) and up to 71\%
   improvement in terms of 3-D point reconstruction accuracy (0.3-0.4 mm).
   The accuracy of distance reconstruction was improved from 0.3 +/- 2.0 mm
   to 0.2 +/- 1.1 mm and angle reconstruction accuracy was improved from
   -0.03 +/- 0.55 degrees to 0.01 +/- 0.06 degrees. Such positioning
   accuracy will allow for the accurate quantification of in vivo
   arthrokinematics crucial for skeletal biomechanics investigations.}},

Abstract = {{We hypothesize that quantification of structural similarity or
   dissimilarity between paired mammographic regions can be effective in
   detecting asymmetric signs of breast cancer. Bilateral masking
   procedures are applied for this purpose by using automatically detected
   anatomical landmarks. Changes in structural information of the extracted
   regions are investigated using spherical semivariogram descriptors and
   correlation-based structural similarity indices in the spatial and
   complex wavelet domains. The spatial distribution of grayscale values as
   well as of the magnitude and phase responses of multidirectional Gabor
   filters are used to represent the structure of mammographic density and
   of the directional components of breast tissue patterns, respectively. A
   total of 188 mammograms from the DDSM and mini-MIAS databases,
   consisting of 47 asymmetric cases and 47 normal cases, were analyzed.
   For the combined dataset of mammograms, areas under the receiver
   operating characteristic curves of 0.83, 0.77, and 0.87 were obtained,
   respectively, with linear discriminant analysis, the Bayesian
   classifier, and an artificial neural network with radial basis
   functions, using the features selected by stepwise logistic regression
   and leave-one-patient-out cross-validation. Two-view analysis provided
   accuracy up to 0.94, with sensitivity and specificity of 1 and 0.88,

Abstract = {{Biofilm formation in natural and engineered porous systems can
   significantly impact hydrodynamics by reducing porosity and
   permeability. To better understand and characterize how biofilms
   influence hydrodynamic properties in porous systems, the genetically
   engineered bioluminescent bacterial strain Pseudomonas fluorescens HK44
   was used to quantify microbial population characteristics and biofilm
   properties in a translucent porous medium. Power law relationships were
   found to exist between bacterial bioluminescence and cell density,
   fraction of void space occupied by biofilm (i.e. biofilm saturation),
   and hydraulic conductivity. The simultaneous evaluation of biofilm
   saturation and porous medium hydraulic conductivity in real time using a
   non-destructive approach enabled the construction of relative hydraulic
   conductivity curves. Such information can facilitate simulation studies
   related to biological activity in porous structures, and support the
   development of new models to describe the dynamic behavior of biofilm
   and fluid flow in porous media. The bioluminescence based approach
   described here will allow for improved understanding and control of
   industrially relevant processes such as biofiltration and
   bioremediation. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{187}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Surface sediment samples were collected from Ziqlab dam in northwestern
   Jordan to investigate the spatial distribution of selected trace metals
   and assess their pollution levels. The results showed that the
   concentrations of Pb, Cd, and Zn exceeded the environmental background
   values. Cd, Ni, and Cr contents were higher than the threshold effect
   level (TEL) in 63, 83, and 60 \% of the reservoir sediments,
   respectively; whereas Pb, Zn, and Cu were less than the TEL limit. The
   concentrations of trace metals in reservoir sediment varied spatially,
   but their variations showed similar trends. Elevated levels of metals
   observed in the western part (adjacent to the dam wall) were coincided
   with higher contents of clay-silt fraction and total organic matters.
   Multivariate analysis indicated that Pb, Co, and Mn may be related to
   the lithologic component and/or the application of agrochemicals in the
   upstream agricultural farms. However, Cd and Zn concentrations were
   probably elevated due to inputs from agricultural sources, including
   fertilizers. Evaluation of contamination levels by the Sediment Quality
   Guidelines of the US-EPA, revealed that sediments were non-polluted to
   moderately polluted with Pb, Cu, Zn, and Cr, but nonpolluted to
   moderately to heavily polluted with Ni and non-polluted with Mn. The
   geoaccumulation index showed that Ziqlab sediments were unpolluted with
   Pb, Cu, Zn, Ni, Cr, Co, and Mn, but unpolluted to moderately polluted
   with Cd. The high enrichment values for Cd and Pb (>2) indicate their
   anthropogenic sources, whereas the remaining elements were of natural
   origins consistent with their low enrichment levels.}},

Journal = {{FLUID DYNAMICS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The effects of inertia on miscible displacements in a Hele-Shaw cell are
   analyzed. Both linear stability analysis and nonlinear simulations are
   performed. The results reveal that inertia tends to attenuate viscous
   fingering. An analysis based on the quasi-steady-state approximation
   (QSSA) revealed that the growth rate at initial time decreases
   monotonically as a modified Reynolds number Re{*} increases, while the
   most dangerous wavenumber tends to shift toward smaller values. It was
   also found that the cutoff wavenumber is not affected by inertia and
   that inertial effects are very limited for longwave instabilities.
   Initial value calculations extended the QSSA and confirmed the decrease
   of the growth rate with Re{*} for long times. Full nonlinear simulations
   based on a spectral method showed that inertial effects tend to delay
   the initial development of the instability and result in wider fingers
   at later breakthrough times. Furthermore, a quantitative analysis of the
   mixing area shows that inertia can extend the dispersive regime. A
   re-scaling of the mixing area and time is proposed and the curves at any
   Peclet and modified Reynolds numbers were superposed onto a single
   universal curve. With this, the mixing area of any flow with different
   inertial effects can be predicted.}},

Abstract = {{Motion artifacts are a major disadvantage of cardiac optical mapping
   studies. Pixel misalignment due to contraction is a main cause of the
   presence of gross motion artifacts in action potential recordings. This
   study is focused on methods for identifying landmarks and tracking the
   motion of cardiac tissue for preparations in optical mapping recordings.
   This is a first step toward our long-term goal to implement a
   landmark-based image registration technique to correct for pixel
   misalignment in cardiac optical mapping fluorescence videos and, hence,
   for gross motion artifacts. Preliminary results for the registration
   step are presented as an initial proof of concept. The characteristics
   of the optical mapping images are challenging, since their lack of
   contrast and well-defined features impose a limitation on the techniques
   than can be used for landmark selection and motion tracking. This paper
   compares results of motion estimation of the cardiac surface with two
   approaches that do not rely on high-contrast features: 1)
   Scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) detected ``keypoints,{''} to be
   used as landmarks for motion tracking, as well as 2) a classical global
   optical flow(OF) algorithm. Both are applied to low-contrast and
   low-resolution cardiac fluorescence images. We demonstrate that the
   performance of SIFT is superior to that of OF for pixel motion tracking
   in cardiac optical mapping images with simulated motion. Results for
   action potential recovery and action potential duration calculation
   after landmark-based image registration show that SIFT landmark-based
   registration yields superior performance in this regard as well.}},

Volume = {{54}},
Pages = {{215-237}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In the current study, we rigorously analyze an arbitrarily shaped
   piezoelectric inclusion surrounded by an infinite isotropic
   piezoelectric matrix subject to antiplane shear and in plane electric
   field loadings. The inclusion and matrix are separated by a
   homogeneously imperfect interface that characterizes a spring type
   interaction between the elastic and electric interfacial boundary
   conditions. Furthermore, the boundary conditions for a mechanically
   compliant, weakly conducting and mechanically compliant, highly
   conducting interface are incorporated into the analysis. Using complex
   variable techniques the potential function inside the inclusion is
   formulated as a Faber Series expansion and a system of linear algebraic
   equations for a closed form solution is developed for the corresponding
   Faber coefficients under a finite number of terms. Under this approach,
   expressions for both the elastic and electric fields are developed for
   the inclusion and matrix. The results are presented in exact form for an
   elliptic inclusion and numerically simulated for a finite number of
   terms for purposes of verification. Additionally, the cases of a square
   and star inclusion geometry are analyzed and results are presented
   numerically. The results clearly demonstrate that not only is the stress
   distribution inside the inclusion interface non-uniform, but that the
   magnitude of the peak stresses are highly dependent on the inclusion
   shape and imperfect interface condition. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A quantitative comparison of an overdriven light-emitting diode (LED)
   and a high-intensity discharge (HID) lamp as illumination sources for
   high-speed schlieren imaging is presented. A custom pulser circuit
   utilizing a new and improved driver circuit was developed to overdrive
   the LED by a factor of ten while simultaneously reducing pulse widths to
   sub-microsecond durations. The LED system has been developed as a simple
   and inexpensive alternative light source to discharge lamps and pulsed
   laser systems, which are typical for high-speed schlieren imaging. Image
   quality of a decaying spherical shock wave, produced from the unsteady
   release of an under-expanded helium jet, is analyzed to assess
   comparative performance. The effects of framing rate, camera exposure
   time, and pulse duration on image quality were assessed and compared for
   the novel LED and an HID. Framing rates of 10,000 and 50,000 fps and
   exposure times of 1 and 10 mu s were tested. Image quality was assessed
   qualitatively through side-by-side comparisons of fluid dynamic features
   such as the resolution of shock waves, compression waves, and shear
   layers. Quantitative analysis was performed through the comparison of
   the signal-to-noise ratio at the various conditions. LED performance was
   found to be superior when imaging fast events and inferior when imaging
   slower events. Results and potential system improvements indicate that
   the LED system is ideal for low-cost, high-speed flow imaging.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The analysis of transport network reliability under a natural disaster
   warning (e.g., impending tsunami) is a complex task, in part, due to the
   uncertainty of the time of the event occurrence at different locations.
   Different magnitudes and epicenters of earthquakes, as well as ocean
   bathymetry, will cause tsunami waves to have different arrival times and
   wave heights at different locations of a network. In this study, the
   southern coastal railway line in Sri Lanka, which is part single track
   and part double track, is analyzed to plan for the operation of trains
   under a tsunami warning. The confusion and concern that will prevail
   among passengers is taken into account. The poor communication and
   signal systems in place are also considered. Planning guidelines are
   proposed to improve communication and to select safe stations under
   various tsunami scenarios. If safe stations are not available, trains
   are directed to stations from which evacuation is possible to a safe
   location. A simple procedure and associated computer program for
   assigning trains to safe or evacuation stations are presented. Lessons
   for other coastal railways are drawn where possible. (C) 2014 American

Abstract = {{In general, standalone global navigation satellite systems (GNSS)
   receiver architectures cannot provide a position accuracy suitable for
   use in vehicular applications in urban canyon scenarios. Specifically,
   GNSS signals are affected by the surrounding objects, such as high
   buildings, trees, and so on, which introduces multipath errors.
   Multipath arises from the reception of reflected or diffracted signals,
   possibly in addition to the line-of-sight signal, and is one of the most
   detrimental error sources in GNSS positioning applications. Multipath
   distributions in the urban canyon area are measured and characterized in
   this paper. In particular, the Doppler and code phase delay under
   different conditions are assessed as a function of vehicle speed and
   signal power, which are different from previous calibration metrics.
   Specifically, multipath directional-dependence phenomenon (i.e., the
   variation resulting from the direction of travel of the user) is
   observed during this process, and the multipath maximum Doppler offset
   and minimum Doppler offset are derived and verified by the real data.
   The multipath distribution will eventually affect the search strategy
   (i.e., search space size, coherent integration time) utilized in the
   high sensitivity receiver.}},

Title = {{Software test-code engineering: A systematic mapping}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{123-147}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Context: As a result of automated software testing, large amounts of
   software test code (script) are usually developed by software teams.
   Automated test scripts provide many benefits, such as repeatable,
   predictable, and efficient test executions. However, just like any
   software development activity, development of test scripts is tedious
   and error prone. We refer, in this study, to all activities that should
   be conducted during the entire lifecycle of test-code as Software
   Test-Code Engineering (STCE).
   Objective: As the STCE research area has matured and the number of
   related studies has increased, it is important to systematically
   categorize the current state-of-the-art and to provide an overview of
   the trends in this field. Such summarized and categorized results
   provide many benefits to the broader community. For example, they are
   valuable resources for new researchers (e.g., PhD students) aiming to
   conduct additional secondary studies.
   Method: In this work, we systematically classify the body of knowledge
   related to STCE through a systematic mapping (SM) study. As part of this
   study, we pose a set of research questions, define selection and
   exclusion criteria, and systematically develop and refine a systematic
   map.
   Results: Our study pool includes a set of 60 studies published in the
   area of STCE between 1999 and 2012. Our mapping data is available
   through an online publicly-accessible repository. We derive the trends
   for various aspects of STCE. Among our results are the following: (1)
   There is an acceptable mix of papers with respect to different
   contribution facets in the field of STCE and the top two leading facets
   are tool (68\%) and method (65\%). The studies that presented new
   processes, however, had a low rate (3\%), which denotes the need for
   more process-related studies in this area. (2) Results of investigation
   about research facet of studies and comparing our result to other SM
   studies shows that, similar to other fields in software engineering,
   STCE is moving towards more rigorous validation approaches. (3) A good
   mixture of STCE activities has been presented in the primary studies.
   Among them, the two leading activities are quality assessment and
   co-maintenance of test-code with production code. The highest growth
   rate for co-maintenance activities in recent years shows the importance
   and challenges involved in this activity. (4) There are two main
   categories of quality assessment activity: detection of test smells and
   oracle assertion adequacy. (5) JUnit is the leading test framework which
   has been used in about 50\% of the studies. (6) There is a good mixture
   of SUT types used in the studies: academic experimental systems (or
   simple code examples), real open-source and commercial systems. (7)
   Among 41 tools that are proposed for STCE, less than half of the tools
   (45\%) were available for download. It is good to have this percentile
   of tools to be available, although not perfect, since the availability
   of tools can lead to higher impact on research community and industry.
   Conclusion: We discuss the emerging trends in STCE, and discuss the
   implications for researchers and practitioners in this area. The results
   of our systematic mapping can help researchers to obtain an overview of
   existing STCE approaches and spot areas in the field that require more
   attention from the research community. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The Hudson Bay Trading Company constructed the Prince of Wales Fort in
   the early eighteenth century with the goal of securing the fur trade in
   northern Canada. As a result of the fort's northern latitude the walls
   remained partially frozen throughout much of each year until recently.
   Warming in the climate has raised the average yearly temperature so
   freeze-thaw cycles have caused a breakdown of the mortar within the
   stone masonry, enabling washout from melting snow and rain. This has led
   to lateral deformation in some sections of the walls and collapse in
   others. Two-dimensional finite-element models have been formulated to
   represent the in situ conditions of a damaged wall section with varying
   strength mortar and bond conditions. The models were created in Abaqus
   and focus on the case of self-weight. Micro-modelling techniques were
   employed to model the stones and grout individually. Results indicate a
   significant reduction in either the strength or bonding capacity of the
   mortar will lead to instability in the wall sections studied. The
   research identifies a new general mechanism of failure for multi-wythe
   masonry walls and their susceptibility to environmental conditions, of
   which practising engineers should be aware when assessing heritage
   masonry structures.}},

Abstract = {{Transportation is one of the major contributors to the global warming
   due to vehicle fossil fuel consumption. Research has shown that changing
   travel behavior is one of the most effective methods in reducing the
   Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions in transportation. Cycling in particular,
   is gaining more attention as a non-automobile alternative mode of
   transportation. A number of studies have been conducted that examined
   the impact of various factors such as demographic characteristics on
   cycling behavior. However, cycling behavior is perceived to be dependent
   on weather conditions as well. This study focuses on cycling in cold
   weather and aims to develop an understanding of characteristics of
   cyclists and their cycling behavior in cold temperatures. An intercept
   survey is conducted among cyclist on a newly implemented bike lane under
   close-to-freezing temperatures in Calgary, Canada. The results of the
   survey provide a baseline for understanding the characteristics of
   winter cycling. Cross-tabulated analysis of the data identified a number
   of statistically significant relationships between different variables.
   The result of this study can help with future planning and policy making
   in regions with cold climate or long and cold winters. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Since the global warming potential of CH4 is 25 times that of CO2 on a
   100-year time horizon, the development of methanotrophic applications
   for the conversion of CH4 to CO2 is emerging as an area of interest for
   researchers and practicing engineers. Compost exhibits most of the
   characteristics required for methanotroph growth media and has been used
   in several projects. This paper presents results from a study that was
   undertaken to assess the influence of physical and chemical
   characteristics of compost-based materials on the biological oxidation
   of CH4 when used in methane biofilters. The results showed that
   easily-measurable parameters, such as air filled porosity, water content
   and dissolved organic carbon, are correlated with maximum CH4 removal
   rates. The results obtained were used to develop an empirical
   relationship that could be regarded as a rapid assessment tool for the
   estimation of the performance of compost-based materials in engineered

Abstract = {{State identification to diagnose the condition of rotating machinery is
   often converted to a classification problem of values of non-dimensional
   symptom parameters (NSPs). To improve the sensitivity of the NSPs to the
   changes in machine condition, a novel feature extraction method based on
   adaptive multiwavelets and the synthetic detection index (SDI) is
   proposed in this paper. Based on the SDI maximization principle, optimal
   multiwavelets are searched by genetic algorithms (GAs) from an adaptive
   multiwavelets library and used for extracting fault features from
   vibration signals. By the optimal multiwavelets, more sensitive NSPs can

   conventional methods are used for comparison study. The obtained NSPs

   the NSPs and achieve a higher discrimination rate for rotor fault
   diagnosis than the conventional methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) has reached maturity in many aspects
   for modeling incompressible, laminar flow and heat and mass transfer.
   However, many issues still need to be clarified. One of those is how to
   deal with Neumann boundary conditions (heat, momentum, and mass fluxes)
   at the interface between layers of different thermophysical properties,
   which is the topic of this work. In this work, we try to illustrate
   modeling of transient and steady-state heat transfer through
   multilayers, ensuring continuity of the flux, temperature, momentum,
   velocity, or species concentration at the interface, which is not a
   trivial issue in any of the numerical methods. Satisfying continuity
   conditions at the interface using the LBM needs special treatment,
   because the relaxation time depends on the thermophysical properties. In
   this work, methods to solve this issue are introduced for solving 1-D
   and 2-D, unsteady heat diffusion problems However, the methods can be
   equally applied for multilayer immiscible fluid flow and mass transfer
   problems. The predictions of the LBM are compared with those of the
   finite-volume method (FVM).}},

Abstract = {{The behavior of the carbonation reaction of the calcined Cadomin
   limestone used for CO2 capture is described using the grain model and
   the changing grain size (CGS) model. To calculate the overall conversion
   over time, the mathematical modeling was solved semianalytically. The
   overall sorbent conversion obtained with the CGS model showed better
   agreement with the experimental data than the results obtained using the
   grain model. In the CGS model, the physical structure of the sorbent
   particle changes during the reaction. The CGS model was modified by
   considering a variable diffusion coefficient of the gaseous reactant
   through the development of the product layer. The modeling results
   showed the positive effects of increasing the reaction temperature and
   particle porosity on the rate of carbonation reaction. However, the rate
   of carbonation reaction decreased by increasing the sorbent particle
   size. Moreover, the modeling results demonstrated an initial kinetic
   control stage which was followed by a diffusion control step in the
   carbonation reaction of the calcined Cadomin limestone.}},

Abstract = {{The unique behaviors of Nafion nanothin films with thicknesses of 10 nm
   (ultrathin) and 160 nm (thin) were evaluated using variable-temperature
   and variable-humidity solid-state H-1 NMR spectroscopy. These
   unprecedented measurements of nanothin films stacked within an NMR rotor
   represent a remarkable experimental achievement and demonstrate that H-1
   NMR spectroscopy of such minute amounts of ionomer might be possible
   within active catalyst layers in polymer electrolyte fuel-cell
   electrodes. This study was motivated by the observation, in a separate
   work, of thickness-dependent and highly suppressed conductivity in
   nanothin films of Nafion (4-300 nm) compared to counterpart
   free-standing Nafion membranes. Trends in the line width and, more
   precisely, the T2 relaxation, as probed using a Hahn echo, showed that
   the local mobility within the hydrogen-bonded domain is equivalent for
   10 and 160 nm films and is governed by the fast exchange limit in terms
   of NMR time scales. Subtle differences in the chemical shift trends
   provide insight into the domain structures, where the 10 nm films show
   no changes whereas the thicker 160 nm films exhibit chemical shift
   trends that indicate a rearranging hydrogen-bonded network. Thus, it is
   inferred that domain structure formation is influenced by film thickness
   and that the interaction with the substrate becomes limiting as the film
   becomes thinner.}},

Abstract = {{The only criteria currently used to inform surgical decision for
   abdominal aortic aneurysms are maximum diameter ( > 5.5 cm) and rate of
   growth, even though several studies have identified the need for more
   specific indicators of risk. Patient-specific biomechanical variables
   likely to affect rupture risk would be a valuable addition to the
   science of understanding rupture risk and prove to be a life saving
   benefit for patients. Local deformability of the aorta is related to the
   local mechanical properties of the wall and may provide indication on
   the state of weakening of the wall tissue. We propose a 3D image-based
   approach to compute aortic wall strain maps in vivo. The method is
   applicable to a variety of imaging modalities that provide sequential
   images at different phases in the cardiac cycle. We applied the method
   to a series of abdominal aneurysms imaged using cine-MRI obtaining
   strain maps at different phases in the cardiac cycle. These maps could
   be used to evaluate the distensibility of an aneurysm at baseline and at
   different follow-up times and provide an additional index to clinicians
   to facilitate decisions on the best course of action for a specific
   patient. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   of Landsat-8 surface reflectance images using MODIS images}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JAN 16}},
Abstract = {{Our aim was to evaluate a spatiotemporal image-fusion model (STI-FM) for
   enhancing the temporal resolution (i. e., from 16 to 8 days) of
   Landsat-8 surface reflectance images by utilizing the
   moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) images, and assess
   its applicability over a heterogeneous agriculture dominant semiarid
   region in Jordan. Our proposed model had two major components: (i)
   establishing relationships between two 8-day MODIS composite images
   acquired at two different times (i.e., time 1 and time 2); and (ii)
   generating synthetic Landsat-8 surface reflectance images at time 2 as a
   function of Landsat-8 images available at time 1 and the relationship
   constructed in the first component. We evaluated the synthetic images
   with the actual Landsat-8 images and observed strong relations between
   them. For example: the coefficient of determination (r(2)) was in the
   range: (i) 0.72 to 0.82; (ii) 0.71 to 0.79; and (iii) 0.78 to 0.83; for
   red, near-infrared (NIR), and shortwave infrared (SWIR2.2 mu m) spectral
   bands, respectively. In addition, root mean square error (RMSE) and
   absolute average difference (AAD) values were: (i) in between 0.003 and
   0.004, and 0.0002, respectively, for red band; (ii) 0.005 and 0.0003,
   respectively, for NIR band; and (iii) 0.004 and in between 0.0001 and
   0.0002, respectively, for SWIR2.2 mu m band. The developed method would
   be useful in understanding the dynamics of environment issues (e.g.,
   agriculture drought and irrigation management), which require both
   relatively high spatial (i.e., 30 m) and high temporal resolution (i.e.,
   8 days) images. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a Creative

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks can be used to monitor many different
   applications, including factory automation. High-variety: manufacturing
   is becoming the new noun, and requires systems capable of rapidly
   reconfiguring without downtime. Homogeneous wireless sensor networks may
   provide a system capable of minimal setup and change-over effort due to
   their hardware indifferences, but are constrained by limited node
   lifetime. In this research a distributed, a multi-agent cluster
   management system that attempts to regulate node death, encouraging
   maintenance approaches to reclaim and replace nodes is proposed. This
   system allows the network to continuously operate, and eliminates any
   downtime due to wireless node power loss. In this paper, an overview of
   a wireless sensor network management approach, the simulator platform
   developed using Java Agent Development Environment (JADE) that will be
   used to test this design, as well as preliminary experimental results
   using this simulator are proposed. The experimental results focus on the
   problem of tracking mobile nodes in an industrial wireless sensor
   network where wireless nodes are subject to battery depletion. The
   results of preliminary experiments with a heterogeneous network (i.e., a
   network with pre-defined cluster heads) show that a distributed,
   multi-agent systems approach is capable of adapting to disturbances
   resulting from node loss. (C) 2015, IFAC (International Federation of

   uses Fuzzy Logic to optimise the standard or ``Exact{''} method for

   independent resource levelling algorithm that is based on fuzzy logic.
   The paper describes a MATLAB implementation of the algorithm along with

   Pressure-sensitive Reservoirs with In-situ Stress Field}},
Journal = {{OPEN PETROLEUM ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{440-450}},
Abstract = {{In pressure sensitive reservoirs, interaction effects among the porous
   media flow field, the fracture field and the stress field can cause some
   specific flow characteristics entirely different from those in
   conventional reservoirs. Dynamic fracture behavior is one of them, which
   generates a change in the value of fracture aperture and even a
   variation in the anisotropy of permeability. In this paper, we focus on
   the dynamic behavior of fractures and some affecting factors, including
   driving pressure and in-situ stress. Numerical discrete fracture network
   (DFN) models are built and solved by the finite element method to
   investigate what the range-ability the fracture presents and what impact
   these affecting factors have. In these mathematical models, both dynamic
   fractures and the fluid-solid coupling are taken into account, and a
   stress-strain model, a flow field model and a fluid-solid coupling model
   are included. Based on the models, the variation of fracture aperture in
   pressure sensitive reservoirs is studied and the results show that a
   different direction and connectivity of fractures lead fracture dilation
   to varying degrees as pressure changes so that the idea of anisotropic
   fracture porosity is proposed for reservoir scale simulation. The study
   also indicates that the drop of formation pressure determines the
   conductivity of fractures and anisotropy of permeability but just has a
   slight impact on the direction of principal permeability. Finally, the
   study shows the interaction of the in-situ stress pressure and the
   fracture field.}},

Abstract = {{Effective extraction of characteristic structures of flow features, such
   as vortices, can simplify visualization and thus potentially enable
   users easier cognition of flow field data. In this paper we present a
   novel method to extract vortex structures through correlation of flow
   domains transformed from the velocity field. This correlation is based
   upon our earlier ``maxima score{''} approach, which is
   domain-independent and normalized. By correlating the maxima score of
   flow domains, we have improved its capabilities for extracting
   characteristic structures of vortices. We have compared our method with
   the feedback of flow analysis experts, and verified the capabilities of
   our method using flow data derived from computational fluid dynamics and
   experimental measurements. These results show that this new method
   reduces noise, and operates at a higher sensitivity for vortex
   extraction than the maxima score is capable of alone.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an inter-wireless body area network scheduling
   algorithm for animal health monitoring. An optimization problem is
   formulated first to jointly reduce the energy consumption per unit time
   and to improve the packet success rate. Due to the combinatorial
   complexity of the optimization problem, a two-step heuristic solution
   algorithm is proposed. The first step is to find the optimal transmit
   power and packet payload size for each sensor by using local
   information. Then the second step uses a best effort method to assign
   time slot to each of the wireless body area networks. At the end of step
   two, the effect of interference is known, and this knowledge helps to
   determine the optimal frame size among all the feasible choices after
   several iterations of objective value calculation or a period of
   performance learning. The simulation results on packet success rate and
   energy consumption show that the proposed best effort time slot
   allocation method outperforms the color-based scheduling algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{In the last few years, low-cost UAV systems have been acknowledged as an
   affordable technology for geospatial data acquisition that can meet the
   needs of a variety of traditional and non-traditional mapping
   applications. In spite of its proven potential, UAV-based mapping is
   still lacking in terms of what is needed for it to become an acceptable
   mapping tool. In other words, a well-designed system architecture that
   considers payload restrictions as well as the specifications of the
   utilized direct geo-referencing component and the imaging systems in
   light of the required mapping accuracy and intended application is still
   required. Moreover, efficient data processing workflows, which are
   capable of delivering the mapping products with the specified quality
   while considering the synergistic characteristics of the sensors
   onboard, the wide range of potential users who might lack deep knowledge
   in mapping activities, and time constraints of emerging applications,
   are still needed to be adopted. Therefore, the introduced challenges by
   having low-cost imaging and georeferencing sensors onboard UAVs with
   limited payload capability, the necessity of efficient data processing
   techniques for delivering required products for intended applications,
   and the diversity of potential users with insufficient mapping-related
   expertise needs to be fully investigated and addressed by UAV-based
   mapping research efforts. This paper addresses these challenges and
   reviews system considerations, adaptive processing techniques, and
   quality assurance/quality control procedures for achievement of accurate
   mapping products from these systems.}},

Abstract = {{Brief electrical stimulation accelerates neuronal regeneration both in
   individual cells and in living models. In vitro experiments facilitate
   further understanding of regeneration mechanisms, and are typically
   carried out by plating individual cells on slides or microelectrode
   arrays. However, uniform electric fields may be better suited to enhance
   growth than traditionally used point-source fields. Applied uniform
   electric fields would allow for long distance stimulation without
   requiring destructively high voltages, and may be more easily
   transferred to an implantable design for clinical use. The viability of
   uniform electric field stimulation was explored in this study through
   the use of a custom-fabricated planar microelectrode array. Simulation
   of several electrode configurations resulted in the design of a parallel
   plate anode-cathode pair. Several such electrode pairs were embedded
   onto a single microelectrode array at various gap widths, to allow for
   the study of electric field strength on overall growth. With this novel
   electrode array, individual Lymnaea snail cells were stimulated with a
   20 Hz, 1 volt pulse train for one hour. The impact of this stimulation
   on growth was measured 24 hours later, and compared to control cells
   plated on identical electrode arrays that were not stimulated.
   Stimulated cells showed an increase in overall neurite length compared
   to the control group. This effect was seen regardless of stimulus
   magnitude, within the range of 1000-2000 mV/mm.}},

Abstract = {{All nervous system functions, ranging from simple reflexes to learning
   and memory, rely on networks of interconnected brain cells called
   neurons, which initiate and convey electrical information. Monitoring
   neuronal activities of a large neuronal ensemble, non-invasively and
   over an extended time period, is pivotal for understanding all brain
   functions. A variety of neuro-electronic interfaces now allow monitoring
   of neuronal and ion channel activities. These neuronal monitoring
   devices are however limited vis-a-vis their efficacy, fidelity and
   longer-term recording capabilities. Here we report on a novel
   microelectrode array technology that allows for the detection and
   characterization of neural activity from individual cells and networks,
   over long periods of time and with a higher signal-to-noise ratio than
   commercially available devices.
   Our in-house development of planar microelectrode arrays has focused on
   modifying design parameters and fabrication techniques to improve their
   performance. One such device, the Soma-Soma Chip (SS-Chip), allows us to
   record activity from single and paired cells (pre- and post-synaptic
   neurons) continuously over extended periods of time with a
   signal-to-noise ratio higher than similar standard devices. This allows
   for the analysis of neural activity, which can help to characterize
   firing patterns of neurons at various developmental-stages. Of
   particular importance is the precise ``signatures{''} of neuronal firing
   pattern that offers a unique opportunity to decipher how neuronal
   activity influences brain network connectivity. Our data also underscore
   the importance of further development of novel microelectrode array
   technologies. These developments will provide novel tools and open new
   research opportunities critical for understanding the fundamental
   cellular and network properties underlying network activity under both
   normal and disease conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The application of terrestrial laser scanners (TLSs) on construction
   sites for automating construction progress monitoring and controlling
   structural dimension compliance is growing markedly. However, current
   research in construction management relies on the planned building
   information model (BIM) to assign the accumulated point clouds to their
   corresponding structural elements, which may not be reliable in cases
   where the dimensions of the as-built structure differ from those of the
   planned model and/or the planned model is not available with sufficient
   detail. In addition outliers exist in construction site datasets due to
   data artefacts caused by moving objects, occlusions and dust. In order
   to overcome the aforementioned limitations, a novel method for robust
   classification and segmentation of planar and linear features is
   proposed to reduce the effects of outliers present in the LiDAR data
   collected from construction sites. First, coplanar and collinear points
   are classified through a robust principal components analysis procedure.
   The classified points are then grouped using a robust clustering method.
   A method is also proposed to robustly extract the points belonging to
   the flat-slab floors and/or ceilings without performing the
   aforementioned stages in order to preserve computational efficiency. The
   applicability of the proposed method is investigated in two scenarios,
   namely, a laboratory with 30 million points and an actual construction
   site with over 150 million points. The results obtained by the two
   experiments validate the suitability of the proposed method for robust
   segmentation of planar and linear features in contaminated datasets,
   such as those collected from construction sites.}},

Abstract = {{Registration of point clouds is a necessary step to obtain a complete
   overview of scanned objects of interest. The majority of the current
   registration approaches target the general case where a full range of

   very common in urban objects scanning to have leveled point clouds with
   small roll and pitch angles and with also a small height differences.
   For such scenarios the registration search problem can be handled faster
   to obtain a coarse registration of two point clouds. In this paper, a
   fully automatic approach is proposed for registration of approximately
   leveled point clouds. The proposed approach estimates a coarse
   registration based on three registration parameters and then conducts a
   fine registration step using iterative closest point approach. The
   approach has been tested on three data sets of different areas and the

Abstract = {{The synthesis of approximately frequency independent array factors at
   low hardware complexity using 2-D infinite impulse response (IIR)
   digital beam filters and nested uniform linear arrays is proposed. The
   array is designed to have multiple levels of nesting. Each level
   consists of a uniform linear array (ULA) covering a separate subband of
   the incident wideband signal. The use of nested arrays allows the
   required aperture size albeit using a significantly smaller number of
   elements compared to using a single ULA to capture the entire wideband
   signal. The use of different levels of nesting further allows the
   operation of the digital processor for each sub-band at different clock
   rates. This is a hierarchical approach which saves both digital VLSI
   hardware and power consumption. The 2-D IIR digital beam filters that
   process each subband signal from each of the nested subarray achieves
   wideband beamforming. Frequency domain simulations have been carried out
   to illustrate the concept of generating approximately frequency
   independent fan-shaped beam passbands as required in wideband

Abstract = {{Application of two-dimensional (2-D) network resonant analog beam
   filters towards increasing the spatial selectivity of microwave
   Applebaum adaptive arrays is explored. By employing a continuous-time

   Applebaum adaptive array, the zero-manifold only array transfer function
   is modified to include complex 2-D pole manifolds at guaranteed
   practical-BIBO stability. Increased spatial selectivity of the proposed
   architecture is observed via a reduction in the side lobe level on
   average. Furthermore, introduction of the 2-D network-resonant beam
   filter increases the usable temporal bandwidth of the original adaptive
   filter and therefore reduces the directional beam pointing errors
   present in the original Applebaum system due to operational frequency
   mismatches. Proposed system exhibits average signal to interference and

Abstract = {{This paper presents results of statistical analysis of fractal and
   texture features obtained from images of diffuse pulmonary diseases
   (DPDs). The features were extracted from preprocessed regions of
   interest (ROIs) selected from high-resolution computed tomography
   images. The ROIs represent five different patterns of DPDs and normal
   lung tissues. A Gaussian mixture model (GMM) was constructed for each
   feature, including all patterns. For each GMM, the six classes were
   identified and compared with the radiological classification of the
   corresponding ROIs. In 78.5\% of the features, the GMM provides, for at
   least one class, a correct classification of at least 60\%. The GMM
   approach facilitates detailed statistical analysis of the
   characteristics of each feature and assists in the development of
   classification strategies.}},

   parameters, linear discriminant analysis and support vector machines can
   provide classification accurate rates over 74\% and area larger than 0.8

   science, brain science, and computational intelligence are a fundamental
   mathematical problem where none of them may be simply reduced onto any

   as mathematical engineering (ME) underpinning cognitive robotics. ME is
   a contemporary form of abstract engineering that studies formal
   structural models and functions of complex, abstract, and mental objects
   and their systematic and rigorous manipulations. ME is embodied by
   denotational mathematics (DM) supplement to traditional analytic
   mathematics. DM is a category of novel mathematical structures as
   function of functions on hyperstructures beyond those of real numbers
   and bits, in order to formalize rigorous expressions and inferences. ME
   powered by DMs provides a novel approach to solve complex and
   intelligent computing problems centric in the development of cognitive
   robots towards autonomous perception, inference, and learning mimicking
   the cognitive mechanisms of the brain.}},

Abstract = {{A novel Fine-grained Differential Harmony Search algorithm (FDHS) is

   mutation scheme with the pitch adjustment operator of Harmony Search
   (HS) algorithm. Meanwhile a fine-grained evaluation strategy is adopted
   inside pitch adjustment on every dimension instead of construction
   completion. The innate self-adaptive feature of differential mutation
   operator makes it demonstrate better exploitation ability than
   fixed-step-size method. While, fine-grained strategy overcomes the
   interference among dimensions throughout evaluation process to a large
   extent. The experiments conducted on typical benchmark functions show
   that the proposed FDHS algorithm demonstrates better convergent speed

Abstract = {{Application of continuous-time domain two-dimensional (2-D) infinite
   impulse response (IIR) filters to improve the spatial selectivity of
   conventional time-delay beamforming for linear arrays is discussed. The
   proposed technique mathematically modify the zero-manifold-only
   time-delay beamformer transfer function by introducing complex
   pole-manifolds at guaranteed stability. A continuous-time domain 2-D IIR
   filter is employed as a pre-filtering stage to an existing time-delay
   beamformer to achieve reduced side-lobe level for the same array size.
   Improved side lobe performance is verified in terms of frequency
   response, array pattern, and signal to interference ratio (SIR)

Abstract = {{Participants in an electricity market expect to have a fair,
   transparent, and open competition. Market Surveillance Administrators
   (MSA) are responsible for monitoring the market outcomes to investigate
   if they are consistent with the fundamentals of the electricity markets.
   It can be an immensely time-consuming process with high amounts of
   computations in an electricity market with huge numbers of participants.
   Besides, a manual review of market operations may be biased by involving
   humans in the decision making process. If this anomaly detection
   procedure can be done automatically then it can be a great aid to the
   market surveillance process for having an unbiased and prompt tool to
   monitor the market. In this paper, an anomaly detection algorithm is
   proposed to identify the events of interest in an electricity market.
   This algorithm provides the MSA with a tool to detect the instances in
   the electricity market when electricity price behavior deviates from the
   normal expected regime. These anomalous hours can then be analyzed
   further in order to diagnose the reason.}},

Abstract = {{Effective resource provisioning for collocated cloud applications each
   with unique traffic patterns is a challenging task. Furthermore,
   resource requirements cannot be adequately determined a priori to
   deployment while traffic generated and received during application
   communication lifecycles is subject to fluctuations that exacerbate
   provisioning. Given this volatility, we analyzed traces from production
   cloud infrastructure mindful of the nonstationarity that presents
   challenges to Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning. Henceforth we
   developed a forecasting model that enables current predictive solutions
   widely applied in the cloud to adapt to a range of diverse operating
   conditions often observable as time-of-day load surges, traffic bursts
   and flash crowds resulting from sudden website popularity. We foster
   robustness in current methods by augmentation with a class of estimators
   adaptable to traffic volatility while providing a tradeoff between
   complexity and performance. The developed forecasting model avails
   itself of the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model
   enhanced by a general class of Adaptive Conditional Score Models (ACS).
   The latter is able to adapt efficiently to load fluctuations observed
   variously as time-of-day traffic surges, flash-crowds and DoS episodes.
   The model offers between 10 \& 15 \% improved accuracy over existing
   models. We have realized a novel algorithm which has been adapted as a
   rate based solution applicable at integral points in the cloud network.
   The analysis and experimentation with our methods suggest a 25\%
   reduction in Average Flow Completion Time (AFCT) when compared with
   current rate based methods of XCP \& RCP while offering a 60\% reduction
   in comparison to TCP.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an analytic characterization of a random access
   strategy in low data-rate networking with the provision for service
   differentiation. Its utility lies in the context of certain emerging
   network types, such as those enabling smart homes and buildings, where a
   set of conflicting requirements makes efficient medium access control
   (MAC) a challenging task. A substantive portion of the traffic from the
   associated applications are event-driven, which necessitates random
   access, while the number of sensing and actuator nodes comprising the
   networks can be fairly large. This challenge to provide scalable random
   access exacerbate further by the need to facilitate service
   differentiation for the higher priority critical traffic. In this
   context, an analysis of near-optimal channel access efficiency is laid
   out keeping level of service differentiation flexible with consideration
   of a carrier sense multiple access based MAC scheme used in low
   data-rate networking. Numerical results with extensive simulations that
   correspond to quantitative analyses are produced.}},

Abstract = {{The collocation of applications in the cloud each with unique traffic
   characteristics presents provisioning challenges to providers.
   Furthermore, the volatility present in traffic sent \& received by these
   applications necessitates a predictive solution for effective QoS
   strategies. To comprehend the tasks faced by cloud providers in this
   regard, we undertook statistical analysis of traffic traces measured
   periodically over a week, taking into account its nonstationarity.
   Henceforth, we developed a model to predict bandwidth utilization
   applicable in maintaining SLAs for multiple traffic flows at the cloud
   network edge and core. The developed univariate forecast model employs
   the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model augmented
   with a general class of Adaptive Conditional Score Models (ACS). Our
   motivation for employing the ACS stems from its robust adaptation to
   outliers \& transients more efficiently with increased computational
   accuracy than current methods; one of such methods being the recently
   adopted Generalized Auto-Regressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity
   (GARCH) to model volatility. These are observable typically as
   flash-crowds, time-of-day load spikes and DDoS events. The model offers
   improvements in forecasts over ARIMA/GARCH models with a 10-15\%
   increase in predictive accuracy. Based on this model, we present 2 novel
   bandwidth adaptive algorithms which find application in the cloud
   network. The first is resident in the application layer of the SDN stack
   as a controller integrated into the OpenStack cloud environment. It was
   tested for effectiveness in a small test-bed where it sustains SLAs at
   95\%. The second methodology has been adapted in ns-2 where we present
   it as (RCP)-C-2: Robust Rate Control Protocol, an extension to the Rate
   Control Protocol (RCP). (RCP)-C-2 offers a 25\% reduction in flow
   completion time over XCP/RCP \& over 60\% reduction compared to TCP.}},

Abstract = {{Radio frequency power amplifiers operate most efficiently in the
   compression region and become less efficient as signal peak-to-average
   power ratio increases. This is due to the amplifier spending more time
   operating below peak power and, thus operating below its maximum
   efficiency. However, the use of the envelope tracking technique can
   dramatically increase the efficiency of RF transmitters. In this work, a
   Volterra series-based behavioral model with compressed sampling is
   developed for an efficiency optimized envelope tracking power amplifier.
   The proposed method reduces the total number of coefficients needed by
   the Volterra series model and enables accurate behavioral modeling of
   nonlinear envelope tracking power amplifiers. Experimental results
   carried on a GaN based power amplifier driven by a four-carrier 18 MHz
   WCDMA signal demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and

Abstract = {{Steam-Assisted-Gravity-Drainage (SAGD) has become one of the most
   prevalent thermal recovery processes to extract heavy oil from oil sand
   reservoirs in Northern Alberta, Canada. Physically, multiple processes
   such as mass balance, energy transport together with solid skeleton
   equilibrium are involved and tightly linked in a coupled manner.
   However, conventional reservoir simulations deal with classical
   multiphase fluid flow equations with seemingly less detailed reservoir
   Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical (THM) computations. The latter plays a major
   role in that the injection of steam significantly alters both the pore
   fluid pressure and temperature fields in the reservoir, which in turn
   impact on effective (skeleton) stresses to lead to plastic deformations
   and ultimately failure. In this study, a comprehensive THM analysis of
   the reservoir was conducted through a proper constitutive modeling of
   the porous medium. Specifically, an advanced elasto-plastic model was
   implemented into a finite element based numerical framework to model
   coupled multiphase fluid flow with geomechanical behavior during SAGD
   process. The geomechanical behavior of oil sand was evaluated through
   stress-strain responses along various stress paths followed during steam
   injection and heating.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the analysis of microstructural mechanisms observed
   during both localized and diffuse failures in granular media,

   Two-dimensional DEM (Discrete Element Method) granular assemblies with
   medium dense and dense packings were subjected to different biaxial
   loading paths to induce either a localized or diffuse failure mode. A
   cluster based analysis is proposed to investigate interactions of
   particles at the mesoscale through the calculation of the second-order
   work from microscopic variables. It is shown that such analysis of
   clusters together with second order work facilitates precise shear band
   pattern recognition during localized failure. The evolution of such
   clusters in terms of their spatial distribution, size and number of
   particles involved, as well as the role played by strong and weak
   phases, describes the nature of the failure at every stage during
   loading. Such microstructural descriptors can predict the propensity of
   the specimen to fail either according to a diffuse or a localized mode.}},

Abstract = {{The paper investigates the plastic response of rigid frictional
   particles under a rotation of principal stresses. The motivation stems
   from the fact that many of the challenging aspects of the response of
   real granular soils are seen when the stress or strain histories include
   episodes of rotation of principal stresses. The paper offers discrete
   element computations (DEM) of plastic flow and induced anisotropy in
   rigid frictional sphere assemblies under stress paths with full six
   degrees of freedom (both normal and shear components) involving rotation
   of principal stress at various stress levels during a drained triaxial
   test in soil mechanics. Basically, walls of the DEM cubical specimen are
   rotated each in turn to induce the target shear and normal stresses
   corresponding to a rotation of principal stress directions at fixed
   principal stress values. It is seen that there are certain rotations for
   which the plastic shear distortions are maximum, which correlate well
   with the principal directions of the fabric of sliding particles. A
   brief discussion is also given on the stability of the granular assembly
   under rotation of principal stresses through the computation of second
   order work.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents an energy-based approach in which the energy input at
   the boundaries of a granular assembly by external stresses is equated
   with frictional dissipation at the microscopic level, as required for a
   quasi-static regime in dense granular flow. A statistical description of
   the contact network associated with a granular assembly encompasses both
   coordination number and fabric anisotropy that can be readily used in
   arriving at stress and strain at the macroscopic level. Starting from
   energy principles and integrating over probability density functions for
   coordination number and contact displacements that provide the relevant
   evolving contact topology and fabric anisotropy during deformation
   history, an explicit expression for the plastic potential function that
   carries the information of the underlying granular micromechanics to the
   macroscopic level is finally obtained. This expression is validated
   through discrete element computations of a 2D assembly of nearly rigid
   disks under biaxial loading as a simple case even though the model can
   be readily generalized to three dimensions.}},

Abstract = {{Peak is an important feature in Synthetic Aperture Radar(SAR), which
   represents essence of scattering centre. There are two general
   approaches in the literature to extract peak. One way is to extract peak
   after speckle suppression filtering. Using this method, the extracted
   feature is in accurate, and the algorithm is more complicated. Another
   is that detecting the amplitude of the peak directly. In order to have a
   fast and accurate peak extraction, we proposed using the Sinc peak model
   algorithm in this paper. It directly extracts peak features from the
   original SAR image without any noise suppression filtering, which is
   instead of Gauss mask function. The estimation parameters of peaks use
   QE theorists. Finally, we can get accuracy three parameters to describe
   peak features. Analytic fluctuation of parameters is compared with Gauss
   model peaks using truth SAR images. Experimental demonstrate that the
   new algorithm is more effective than others for extracting peak features
   in SAR images.}},

Abstract = {{Web services have increasingly begun to rely on public cloud platforms.
   The virtualization technologies employed by public clouds can however
   trigger contention between virtual machines (VMs) for shared physical
   machine (PM) resources thereby leading to performance problems for the
   Web service. Past studies have exploited PM level performance metrics
   such as Clock Cycles Per Instruction to detect such platform induced
   performance interference. Unfortunately, public cloud customers do not
   have access to such metrics. They can typically only access VM-level
   metrics and application level metrics such as transaction response times
   and such metrics alone are often not useful for detecting inter-VM
   contention. This poses a difficult challenge to Web service operators
   for detecting and managing platform induced performance interference
   issues inside the cloud. We propose a machine learning based
   interference detection technique to address this problem. The technique
   applies collaborative filtering to predict whether a given transaction
   being processed by a Web service is suffering adversely from
   interference. The results can then be used by a management controller to
   trigger remedial actions, e.g., reporting problems to the system manager
   or switching cloud providers. Results using a realistic Web benchmark
   show that the approach is effective. The most effective variant of our
   approach is able to detect about 96\% of performance interference events
   with almost no false alarms.}},

Abstract = {{We propose that participatory GIS (PGIS) activities including
   participatory urban planning can be made more efficient and effective if
   spatial reasoning rules are integrated with PGIS tools to simplify
   engagement for public contributors. Spatial reasoning is used to
   describe relationships between spatial entities. These relationships can
   be evaluated quantitatively or qualitatively using geometrical
   algorithms, ontological relations, and topological methods. Semantic web
   services utilize tools and methods that can facilitate spatial
   reasoning. GeoSPARQL, introduced by OGC, is a spatial reasoning standard
   used to make declarations about entities (graphical contributions) that
   take the form of a subject-predicate-object triple or statement.
   GeoSPARQL uses three basic methods to infer topological relationships
   between spatial entities, including: OGC's simple feature topology,
   RCC8, and the DE-9IM model. While these methods are comprehensive in
   their ability to define topological relationships between spatial
   entities, they are often inadequate for defining complex relationships
   that exist in the spatial realm. Particularly relationships between
   urban entities, such as those between a bus route, the collection of
   associated bus stops and their overall surroundings as an urban planning
   pattern. In this paper we investigate common qualitative spatial
   reasoning methods as a preliminary step to enhancing the capabilities of
   GeoSPARQL in an online participatory GIS framework in which reasoning is
   used to validate plans based on standard patterns that can be found in
   an efficient/effective urban environment.}},

   Mainly two approaches are discussed: the use of CS to recover
   amplitude-distorted signals, and the use of CS to reduce the complexity
   of the digital predistorters. Experimental results obtained using an

Abstract = {{The virtualized cloud hosts multiple applications each with unique
   traffic characteristics necessitating QoS provisioning for its finite
   network resource. While hypervisor and network based virtualization
   techniques provide traffic isolation in multitenant cloud environments,
   there is a gap in their interworking \& integration for effective
   end-to-end SLA maintenance. Recent solutions in cloud network
   provisioning through reservation practices have accomplished some degree
   of success. However they are oblivious of the entire application
   communication path \& don't provide the requisite SLA. In this work, we
   develop a reservation methodology that is aware of the complex hierarchy
   of the cloud network. Furthermore, given the volatility of traffic
   generated and received by cloud tenant applications, we employ a general
   class of dynamic score models of time-series to develop a predictive
   algorithm integrated with the bandwidth provisioning framework. This
   solution is resident in the application layer of the SDN stack as a
   controller. Our methods have been tested in the OpenStack environment
   that integrates a layered cloud network in a real-life test-bed. Our
   predictive methods provide a 15\% increase in accuracy over current
   methods while able to provide effective SLA maintenance across clients
   with unique QoS requirements.}},

Abstract = {{That oil spills are quickly reliably detected and the oil spill
   information is distributed to related users or emergency responders in
   real-time is very important in oil spill response and contingency

   Airborne Fluorosensor (SLEAF) sensor operated by Environment Canada, are
   among the most appropriate sensors for oil spill surveillance. In this
   paper, a reliable classification scheme is proposed for oil spill
   detection based on SLEAF data. Event-driven architecture can
   automatically notify and push information to related users, so it is
   suitable for developing active real-time information distribution
   system, such as emergency response system. Since oil spill information
   is spatially related information, a geospatial-based publish/subscribe
   model, which extends the function of general publish/subscribe model in
   event-driven system and can process geospatial subscriptions and events,
   is proposed. At last, based on the oil spill detection methods,

Abstract = {{Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is an important application
   domain for information reuse and integration. Efficient integration and
   deployment of information and communication technologies (ICT) can
   potentially reduce travel time and emission, improve usage of parking
   and public spaces, offer personalized travel related services, and more
   importantly, improve safety for drivers and pedestrians in large
   municipalities. Personalized travel related services and recommendation
   systems rely mainly on precise identification of position of the
   vehicles. In this paper we propose a cooperative multi-sensor
   multi-vehicle localization algorithm with high accuracy for terrestrial
   vehicles. Noisy observations in the form of GPS coordinates of nearby
   vehicles as well as inter-vehicle distance measurements are assumed to
   be available. These heterogeneous sources of information are fused
   together and used to estimate the number and motion model parameters of
   the vehicles in the field. The problem is formulated in the context of
   Bayesian framework and vehicle locations are estimated via a Sequential
   Monte-Carlo Probability Hypothesis Density (SMC-PHD) filter. Given that
   the GPS data and inter-vehicle distance measurements are available
   except for short periods of time, simulation results indicate that the
   proposed algorithm provides approximately threefold improvement in
   location accuracy compared to that achieved with GPS.}},

Abstract = {{In real world situations, customer behavior is changing and evolving
   over time. It is necessary to consider this dynamism in customer
   segmentation analysis and other business-related activities to develop
   effective marketing strategies. The main aim of this study is to explore
   the patterns of customer segments' structural changes. Up to now, there
   has been no research on this particular topic. This is the first study
   that investigates the impact of customer dynamics on segments'
   structural changes. This paper tries to develop a method to describe and
   explain this issue. A new method is proposed based on the clustering and
   sequential rule mining techniques. Furthermore, a new definition and
   framework for finding distinguishing sequential rules is developed. The
   proposed method is implemented on the customer data of a
   telecommunication service provider. The results show that the method is
   capable in this domain. The findings reveal a group of customers whose
   dynamic behavior causes structural changes. We name this group as
   ``structure breakers{''}. The marketing managers of this company can use
   the obtained results to improve their marketing strategies and
   decision-making. This method can be used in every other organization to
   mine the patterns of segments' structural changes.}},

Abstract = {{In hospitals, telemetry is utilized by physicians to provide accurate
   diagnosis for their patients. The increase penetration of wireless
   technology in healthcare environment for powering, monitoring and
   sensing purposes of implanted or attached devices to human patients'
   triggered new challenges in designing reconfigurable wireless
   transceiver intended for healthcare that can operate in multi-frequency
   mode. To minimize the number of RF receivers needed for these kind of
   applications, a broadband subsampling receiver is proposed. Recently,
   this technique has been proposed for software defined radio (SDR)
   applications to allow multiple and concurrent RF signal digitization
   directly from the RF stage by using a sampling frequency much lower than
   the RF frequency. In this paper, band-pass sub-sampling technique widely
   used in many applications, such as radar, sonar, data acquisition,
   measurement and instrumentation is reviewed. An efficient subsampling
   algorithm is proposed to determine the sampling frequency needed such
   that interferences between the different monitoring and sensing medical
   signals is mitigated. Measurement results are provided with RF
   instrumentation equipment and a low speed ADC to validate the proposed
   architecture for multi-frequency monitoring and sensing applications.}},

Abstract = {{A procedure is proposed in the context of microwave breast imaging to
   iteratively refine the resolution of the reconstruction model for the
   glandular region used by the imaging algorithm. The reconstruction model
   begins with a small number of large reconstruction elements and the
   dielectric properties are estimated over these elements. For subsequent
   iterations, the density of the mesh elements within the glandular region
   increases. The imaging algorithm uses the results from the reconstructed
   image of the previous step to initialize the dielectric properties of
   the model elements. An incident field with a higher frequency than the
   previous step is used. Dielectric properties over the finer model
   elements are estimated from the scattered data which have a higher
   spectral content. The procedure continues until a satisfactory
   resolution of the reconstructed image is achieved. The aim of the
   strategy is to improve the resolution of the reconstructed profile while
   overcoming problems associated with solving a highly non-linear and
   severely ill-posed inverse scattering problem. The feasibility of the
   algorithm is evaluated with numerical results based on a synthetically
   generated breast phantom.}},

Abstract = {{Within-Sample Choice Distribution and Sample size are important
   considerations in the estimation of logit model, but their effects on
   the estimation accuracy have not been systematically studied. Therefore,
   the objective of this paper is to provide an empirical examination to
   the above issues through a set of simulated choice datasets. In this
   paper, the utility function coefficients and alternative specific
   constants (ASCs) are specified as a prior. Then, assuming alternative
   attributes and error components follow a normal distribution, both
   revealed preference (RP) and stated preference (SP) synthetic choice
   datasets are simulated. Based on these simulated datasets, the utility
   coefficients and ASCs are re-estimated and compared with the original
   values specified as the prior. It is found that the utility coefficients
   can be re-estimated with reasonable accuracy, but the estimates of the
   ASCs are confronted with much larger errors. The Sum of Square Errors
   (SSEs) between the ``original{''} and the estimated utility coefficients
   and ASCs using RP and SP datasets of varying sample size are calculated,
   plotted and the corresponding diminishing marginal return points are
   identified. Regarding within-sample choice distribution, study results
   show that, as the within-sample choice distribution becomes more
   balanced, the hit-ratio decreases. It appears that, when alternatives
   are chosen with similar frequency, choosing one alternative vs. another
   does not make much difference in terms of utility perceived by each
   decision-maker. Therefore, it is suggested that a population with
   varying socioeconomic characteristics be created and used in future
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{Conceptual design plays an important role in the process of

   evaluations. To consider both fuzziness uncertainties and randomness
   uncertainties for evaluation of PSS concepts, a new PSS concept
   evaluation approach is developed in this research based on the
   information axiom in axiomatic design. First, the PSS evaluation
   criteria are classified into four categories. Second, a hybrid model is
   introduced to describe the evaluation criteria. Third, the methods to
   calculate the information contents of the hybrid uncertain evaluation
   criteria are developed based on the fuzzy-random variable

Abstract = {{An adaptable product is the one that can be changed/adapted, such as
   reconfigured and upgraded, during the product operation stage to satisfy
   the changes in requirements. Design of adaptable products can bring with
   both economic and environmental benefits. Adaptable design is the design
   paradigm that aims at creating adaptable products. Since parameter
   variations caused by uncertainties usually lead to variations of product
   performance, robustness has to be considered in design of adaptable
   products. This research aims at developing an integrated framework to
   design architecture, configurations and parameters of adaptable product
   such that the product can be adapted to satisfy the changed
   requirements, meanwhile the product performance is the least sensitive
   to parameter variations. In this work, design of an adaptable product in
   the embodiment design stage is conducted at three different levels:
   parameter, configuration and architecture levels. At the parameter
   level, an adaptable product can be achieved through the changes of
   parameter values. At the configuration level, an adaptable product can
   be achieved through the changes of product configurations. At the
   architecture level, an adaptable product can be achieved through
   selection of an open architecture to connect the platform of the product
   with the add-on modules by interfaces. Characteristics of adaptable
   design at the three different levels are discussed. Modeling methods to
   describe various configuration candidates in design and various
   configuration states in operation of an adaptable product are

Abstract = {{With advances in microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technology, many
   modern personal navigation devices incorporate measurements from various
   low-cost sensors alongside Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)
   receivers. However, both GNSS and other low-cost sensors are prone to
   the occurrence of faults that are either un-modeled or poorly modeled.
   This affects the usability of such personal navigation devices in some
   applications where reliability is a critical parameter. This paper thus
   presents several algorithms to either detect and remove such faults or
   model them properly in order to improve performance, especially
   reliability, for low cost multi-sensor integrated navigation systems.
   The algorithms presented in this paper can be broadly categorized into
   two parts. The first part focuses on optimizing the use of GNSS
   measurements in harsh environments. This is done by replacing the
   assumption of normal distribution of GNSS measurements with that of a
   heavy-tailed distribution. Moreover, the covariance of such distribution
   is also adapted to match the true error characteristics of the
   surrounding environment with the aid of inertial units. The second part
   of the algorithm detects possible faults arising in various sensors.
   Based on the type of sensor fault, the algorithm either rejects some of
   the measurements before they enter the integration filter, issues a
   warning signal to indicate lack of reliability information or deems the
   navigation solution unusable.
   The analyses of the proposed algorithms showed that faults were detected
   successfully and that the performance of the navigation system was
   improved in terms of both reliability and accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{In order to improve the accuracy of user's position solution using
   Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) in urban canyons, it is
   important to know whether a satellite's signal is obstructed by
   surrounding buildings. This can be accomplished by using an
   upward-facing camera and segmenting the image into sky and non-sky. This
   paper evaluates the Otsu, Mean Shift, Graph cut and HMRF-EM-image image
   segmentation algorithms for this purpose. Since some algorithms provide
   two or more categories, segmentation is followed by k-means clustering
   techniques to yield only two categories; sky and non-sky. The algorithms
   are tested using images taken using an upwardfacing camera at roughly
   the same locations in different weather conditions: cloudy and sunny.
   Result shows that, when images are appropriately adjusted, the Otsu
   method overcomes the three other algorithms in terms of the percentage
   of sky accurately segmented and is also more computationally efficient.
   Experiment was also perform in Calgary downtown to show the effect of
   segmentation on the GNSS accuracy. Results show that, when obstructed
   satellites are removed, the RMS of the residuals decreases significantly
   compare to when all satellites are used.}},

Abstract = {{GNSS carrier phase measurement capability is one of the most important
   features for high performance/accuracy receivers. However significant
   signal attenuation due to blockage and multipath as experienced indoors
   for example, degrades carrier phase quality in standard carrier phase
   tracking loops using PLL or KF-PLL. Under such conditions, the receiver
   may not be able to generate reliable carrier phase measurements either
   due to weak signal, fading or fragility of conventional tracking loops.
   One contribution of this paper is the proposed decoupled maximum
   likelihood carrier phase, Doppler and Doppler rate tracking
   architecture. This approach first independently estimates Doppler rate
   and Doppler based on power spectra and then estimates the carrier phase
   if possible. In order to assess the actual carrier phase measurement
   quality, controlled simulation is also conducted after analyzing the
   overall phase tracking performance. Double differenced carrier phase
   results as well as RTK solutions show that the proposed method works
   well and is able to generate reliable carrier phase measurement and
   centimeter level solution when the carrier-to-noise-density ratio
   (C/N-0) is about 20 dB-Hz.}},

Abstract = {{Multipath remains a dominant source of error in satellite-based
   navigation, despite a great deal of effort by researchers and receiver
   manufacturers to reduce it. Mitigation of multipath errors is especially
   difficult when the Doppler shift between the direct and secondary
   propagation paths is very small (approximately 1-2 Hz) and this is
   usually the case in urban canyons where the reflectors are almost
   parallel to the direction of motion of the receiver. Multipath parameter
   estimation is one option; however, the method needs the number of
   secondary paths in order to estimate the multipath parameters. Moreover,
   in weak signal environments, the problem becomes more challenging. In
   this paper we present multipath parameter estimation assisted with a 3D
   building model to provide the number of secondary paths as well as
   initial estimates for the relevant delays. The estimation is based on a
   Least Squares estimation technique using a grid of correlators. The
   concept is proven using simulated data and tested using real data.
   Result shows that the accuracy of estimated parameters improves
   significantly if the estimator is aided with 3D building model
   information.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new sensor fusion approach for using multiple
   MEMS sensor-based pedestrian navigation systems (PNSs) to enhance the
   performance of each individual navigation system. First, we propose a
   novel single IMU-based PNS which integrates both the inertial navigation
   system (INS) mechanization and the pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR)
   mechanization. When two identical PNSs are used by a user at the same
   time, the output of each PNS is then shared within a Kalman filter (KF)
   with the state-constrained approach, which, in turn, feeds the state
   error correction information back to each PNS. Several real experiments
   are done to assess the proposed methodology for the integration of
   multiple PNSs. The experimental studies clearly indicate that through
   applying the proposed state-constrained approach, using motion sensor
   data from multiple mobile/wearable devices could provide more accurate
   navigation information for a pedestrian in all indoor and outdoor

Abstract = {{This paper provides a real-time attitude determination algorithm using
   gyros, accelerometers, and magnetometers on consumer portable devices.
   The main advantage of this algorithm is that uses a Kalman filter
   algorithm and utilizes multi-level constraints, including
   pseudo-observation updates, measurements from accelerometers and
   magnetometers, and the quasi-static attitude updates. Walking tests with
   different brands of smartphones showed that the algorithm provided
   promising absolute heading results outdoors, and provided smooth
   relative heading results indoors with different phone places such as
   handheld, at an ear, dangling with hand, and in a pants pocket.}},

Abstract = {{Several terrestrial communication systems use the same frequency
   spectrum as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) or bands close to
   it. Pseudolites constitute one such system that generally uses the GNSS
   spectrum for signal propagation. The signals from pseudolites in the
   operating region play a crucial role in augmenting satellite based user
   navigation. These signal transmitters are deployed at ground stations
   for the majority of their applications. In the near region, pseudolites
   are overpowered and cause impediments to normal receiver operation due
   to an increase in the noise floor. Interference and jammers form another
   source of GNSS disruption. Interference could result from intentional
   jammers or unintentional signal disturbances from inband or out-of-band
   high power sources. A GNSS user can experience interference from near
   region pseudolites as well as from other interferers. These interference
   sources may have directional coexistence with pseudolites or GNSS
   satellites. Such disruptions might completely block signal acquisition
   and lead to processing failure.
   The capability of antenna array space-time processing to counter the
   above mentioned scenario is demonstrated herein. In addition to
   interference mitigation, pseudolite signal recovery in the near region
   and subsequent enhancements are shown. Results that demonstrate
   improvement in measurement geometry for various antenna array
   configurations and different processing modes are also shown.}},

Abstract = {{Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder
   caused by deficiency of the enzyme acid beta-glucosidase
   (glucocerebrosidase) due to mutations in the GBA gene. The most common
   form (type I) is associated with severe hematologic, visceral and bone
   disease. Disease-modifying treatments, such as enzyme replacement
   therapy and substrate reduction therapy, can improve the hematologic and
   visceral aspects of the disease but success with improving severe
   osteopenia, which can increase the risk of fractures, is limited. Our
   case involves a patient with complex disease affecting bone health
   including Gaucher disease (type I), Sjogren syndrome, rheumatoid
   arthritis and corticosteroid use who did not respond to long term use of
   bisphosphonates. We report an improvement in bone mineral density and
   bone architecture commensurate with a reduced incidence of fractures in
   whom we used teriparatide (human parathyroid hormone (PTH; 1-34) to
   treat severe osteopenia. We conclude that teriparatide should be
   considered for further studies as an agent to improve bone mineral
   density in patients with Gaucher disease.}},

Abstract = {{Uncertainty in data or in the parameters of models occurs in many real
   world applications. Quantifying this uncertainty and its effects is
   required for robust design, control and optimization. In this paper, we
   attempt to build a proxy model for the stochastic solutions of coupled
   governing equations describing coalbed methane (CBM) production at
   different well bottomhole pressures. To achieve this, monthly production
   from wells (output) is expanded as a linear combination of Legendre
   orthogonal polynomials in the input (well bottomhole pressure) and the
   Wiener-Askey polynomial chaos is used to propagate the uncertainty of
   the model parameters. A Gaussian quadrature technique is then employed
   to solve for the coefficients of the basis functions in the proxy model.
   Alternatively, nonlinear least squares curve fitting using the
   Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA) is also used with polynomial chaos
   expansion to generate the stochastic proxy model. The proxy model now
   enables robust optimization using statistical metrics of CBM production
   calculated over the entire parameter space. In the case of multiple
   decision variables, the appropriate proxy model built using these
   techniques will allow for robust optimization without the use of any
   search algorithms. (C) 2015, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose a detailed placement algorithm targeting
   detailed routability for designs at or smaller than 22nm. The sheer
   number and complexity of routing design rules at these feature sizes
   preclude direct incorporation of detailed routing rules into a placement
   algorithm. However, using the detail routing information to guide the
   placement can significantly reduce the overall design time and improve
   the performance of the circuit. Our proposed detailed routing-aware
   detailed placement (DrDp) is developed as an add-on to the detailed
   placement process to improve detailed routability in a relatively short
   runtime. The proposed technique is added to the code obtained from one
   of the top three teams in the ISPD 2014 detailed routing-driven
   placement contest and tested on ISPD 2014 benchmark suite. Numerical
   results show that the proposed technique can improve the detailed
   routing quality with no significant change in detailed placement score,

Abstract = {{In this decade, the smartphone has become an ideal platform for indoor
   navigation applications. Much research has been done in this topic,
   however, smartphone-based indoor navigation is still challenging. This
   paper proposes an improved integration structure for WiFi fingerprinting
   and MEMS sensors for indoor navigation. The main contribution of this
   work is that the proposed method constrains the search space for WiFi
   fingerprinting, which improves the process speed and positioning
   accuracy for WiFi fingerprinting. In this method, the search space is
   estimated adaptively based on the position variance in the extended
   Kalman filtering and matched access point number in WiFi fingerprinting.
   The field experiments show that the proposed structure can achieve the
   positioning accuracy of 2.14 m - 3.68 m (RMS) only using
   crowdsourcing-based WiFi radio map database, which is much better than
   the MEMS-based navigation solution and traditional loosely-coupled
   integration solution.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we proposed two different approaches for incorporating
   non-linear state inequality constraints into a Kalman filter (KF). The
   first approach incorporates a soft constraint into a KF to ensure that
   the state estimate almost satisfies the constraints rather than strictly
   satisfies the constraints; the second approach incorporates a hard
   constraint into a normal KF to ensure that the state estimate should
   strictly satisfy the constraints. Simulation study has been conducted in
   the integration of two different pedestrian navigation systems. The
   simulation results show that both approaches can well bound the state
   estimates errors compared with the unconstrained state estimates.
   However, when a constraint's nonlinearity level is getting stronger, as
   well as the linearization point is less accurate, the performances of
   both approaches will decrease, especially for the soft constraint
   approach. The improved performance of the constrained filters comes with
   a price, which is computational effort. The filter with soft constraints
   requires only slightly more computational effort than the unconstrained
   filter, but the filter with hard constraints requires a greater
   computational effort compared with the soft constraint approach.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an integrated pedestrian dead-reckoning (PDR) /
   Magnetic matching (MM) navigation algorithm with off-the-shelf sensors
   in smartphones. This method maximizes the advantages and minimizes the
   disadvantages of each technology. As magnetic matching is a
   profile-matching method, we calculate the rough length of the measured
   profile using the steps detected by accelerometers. Because accurate and
   real-time steplength estimation is still an open issue for pedestrian
   navigation, we utilize the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm for
   matching with an inaccurate profile length. Additionally, we detect the
   roll and pitch angles using accelerometers in smartphones and extract
   the vertical and horizontal magnetic intensities, in order to increase
   the magnetic fingerprint dimension without extra sensors. Furthermore,
   we use magnetic gradient fingerprints, instead of magnetic intensity
   fingerprints, to mitigate the effect of the diversity and the run-to-run
   biases of MEMS magnetometers. Tests with different smartphones indicated
   that the matched MM results were accurate and had small fluctuations.
   Nevertheless, although MM is a profile-matching algorithm, it had
   mismatches (i.e., matches to an incorrect point that were more than 20 m
   away from the true value) on several occasions. The integration of PDR
   and MM has the potential to provide continuous and reliable navigation
   results in indoor environments having frequent magnetic interferences,
   and under natural device motion modes including handheld, at the ear,
   dangling with hand, and in a pocket.}},

Abstract = {{Visual odomestry with monocular or stereo cameras becomes an effective

Abstract = {{Monocular and binocular visual odometry has attracted a lot of
   attentions due to their advantages such as low cost and rich texture
   recently. Visual odometry is an effective dead reckoning system which
   estimates the 6 degrees of freedom (6DoF) ego-motion including three
   position increments and three alignment increments by using the
   continuously tracked features in consecutive frames. Like any other dead
   reckoning system, visual odometer accumulates errors over time.
   Integration of camera with a wide variety of sensors such as odometer,
   laser scanner, IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and GPS reduces the
   unavoidable visual odometry error growth rate and extends the duration
   of reasonable navigation solution. IMU and camera are complementary
   sensors and the integration of these two sensors reduces the error
   accumulation of both sensors. Several loosely and tightly coupled
   integration of IMU and vision have been developed during the last decade
   which uses cameras and full IMU including three accelerometers and three
   gyroscopes. In this paper, we proposed a new method for reduced IMU (two
   horizontal accelerometers and one vertical gyro) and vision integration
   called RISAVS (Reduced Inertial Sensor And Vision System). RISAVS
   eliminates several error sources that exist when using a traditional
   full IMU (especially the low cost MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Sensor)
   based IMUs) in land vehicles. RISAVS method formulation was derived and
   it was tested with online datasets provided by KITTI (Karlsruhe
   Institute of Technology and Toyota technological Institute). The
   proposed method performed better than classical visual odometry.
   Furthermore, it reduces the cost of the system by using reduced IMU
   instead of full IMU.}},

Abstract = {{Precise point positioning (PPP) integer ambiguity resolution is able to
   significantly shorten the time-to-first-fix (TTFF) and improve the
   positioning accuracy when correction for fractional cycle biases (FCBs)
   are available to recover the integer feature of the ambiguities. When
   real-time orbit and clock products are fixed to estimate the satellite
   FCB corrections, the narrow-lane (NL) FCB corrections will be biased by
   the Line-Of-Sight (LOS) errors of the orbits and clocks. Then the biased
   NL FCB estimates will affect ambiguity resolution (AR) performance as
   well as positioning accuracy. We propose a cascaded method to
   effectively separate the orbit errors from the satellite FCBs and to
   broadcast both as improved satellite FCBs for PPP users to further
   improve ambiguity resolution performance. The satellite NL improved FCB
   corrections are modeled by one direction-independent component and three
   directional-dependent components for each satellite, instead of only one
   direction-independent component. The direction-independent component
   assimilates actual FCBs whereas the directional-dependent components are
   used to assimilate the orbit errors. Besides, the cascaded method avoids
   estimated large amount of parameters in the same time which guarantees
   the model strength. GPS measurements from both regional and global
   experimental networks have been processed with the IGS Real-Time Service
   (RTS) and rapid products. The improvements by the proposed FCB
   estimation method are validated in terms of the mean and RMS values of
   the estimated FCBs, the performance of recovering the integer property
   of ambiguities as well as the obtainable positioning accuracy. The
   numerical results confirm that the obtained FCBs using the proposed
   method outperform the original FCBs which improve not only the ambiguity
   fix rate but also the positioning accuracy. Compared to those with the
   original FCBs, the percentage of the fractions of the ambiguities within
   0.15 are improved by up to 12.2\%. The horizontal position accuracy can
   be improved by up 28.8\%.}},

   composite signal shows temporal and spatial power fluctuations, a

   GPS signals at different frequency bands in a fading environment are not
   broadly discussed in the literature and is the focus of the paper.
   Frequency selective fading of GNSS signals in typical propagation
   channels is discussed herein. The temporal fading of modern L2C and L1
   GPS signals is analyzed simultaneously in various fading environments.
   The frequency diversity reception is characterized in terms of C/N-0
   fluctuations and correlation coefficients among other metrics. The
   amount of SNR enhancement obtained from frequency diversity combination
   is evaluated and compared with the spatial diversity combination.
   Pseudorange error reduction resulting from diversity combination is also

Abstract = {{The real-time kinematic (RTK) relative positioning uses differential
   carrier phase observations for precise positioning determination and has
   been used widely. RTK positioning can be carried out as enough visible
   satellites (>= 4) are observed, which may not be satisfied in signal
   shading areas. Since the BeiDou system came into operation in December
   2012, there are a total of triple satellite navigation systems offering
   independent PNT services today. It is obvious that combining GPS,
   GLONASS and BeiDou will significantly increase the number of satellites
   in view. In RTK positioning, the ambiguity should be able to be resolved
   much faster, possibly even with a single epoch of observations. However,
   instantaneous ambiguity resolution with a high level of reliability is
   still a challenging task using a single satellite system based on RTK.
   The available multiple navigation system signals are expected to provide
   great benefit for fast and reliable integer ambiguity resolution (AR).
   This paper will focus on combined GPS, GLONASS and BeiDou
   single-baseline RTK. A measurement model based on single-differenced
   (SD) observations between receivers has been developed. Based on this
   new model, an ambiguity datum at each frequency is introduced and SD
   receiver clock offset, differential code bias (DCB), inter-system bias
   (ISB) and un-calibrated phase bias (UPB) are estimated as unknowns in
   addition to the conventional unknowns parameters for position
   coordinates and phase ambiguities. An estimation procedure will also be
   described in which above-mentioned parameters are not directly
   estimated, but derived from the preliminary filtering solutions, which
   is also beneficial to AR involving GLONASS signals because of no
   additional calculation for the ambiguity of reference satellite.
   The performance of the combined GPS, GLONASS and BeiDou RTK under
   different cut-off elevations varying from 10 degrees to 40 degrees with
   a 5 degrees interval has be investigated for both the single-and
   dual-frequency case using real data. Satellite visibility, dilution of
   precision (DOP), ambiguity fixed rate (the fixed epoch number / the
   total epoch number) and correctly fixed rate (the correctly fixed number
   / the fixed epoch number) are analyzed and evaluated. According to the
   obtained results, the combined triple systems get better performance
   than that derived from using a single system or combined dual systems.
   The advantage becomes significant in the single-frequency case or when
   the mask elevation angle turns to high. Although the cut-off elevation
   reaches 40 degrees, much enough satellites can be observed, larger than
   60\% and 90\% of all the epochs are fixed and correctly fixed for single
   and dual-frequency case. Such a high cut-off elevation can be allowed
   with the combined RTK, which can significantly increase the GNSS
   applications available in constrained environments, for example in urban
   areas. In addition, the obtained results from our experiments indicate
   that the BDS navigation system performs better than the GPS or GLONASS
   when using a higher cut-off elevation.}},

Abstract = {{Oscillator phase noise can significantly degrade weak signal tracking
   performance. This paper analyzes and compares two tracking loop
   architectures to address the oscillator phase noise problem. The first
   architecture, known as the co-op tracking loop, attempts to estimate the
   instantaneous clock phase and exclude it from the incoming signals
   before tracking the LOS dynamics. The second method, known as the
   difference correlator, eliminates the phase noise by subtracting two
   channel instantaneous phases at the correlator level.
   The contributions of this paper include comprehensive analyses supported
   by simulations to evaluate the combined effect of Additive White
   Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and oscillator clock phase noise on the tracking
   performance of these two architectures. In addition, the impact of
   dissimilar transit times for different satellites on tracking
   performance is investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Space-time processing (STP) is studied in Global Navigation Satellite
   System (GNSS) as an effective tool to mitigate interference in
   spatiotemporal domain. However, without specific considerations, the STP
   results in biases and distortions in the cross-correlation function
   (CCF) of the ranging codes. The CCF degradation can happen due to the
   combined effect of space-time processing and the unintentional signal
   attenuation by filtering. This paper focuses on characterizing these
   degradations for different scenarios like the number of interference and
   number of tap delays in the temporal filter in STP. The results from
   characterization can be used for designing the low distortion filters
   that are especially important for high accuracy applications in
   challenging environments. The simulation test bed discussed in this
   paper enables one to perform accurate analyses in the field of STP.
   Additionally, an analysis of the independent contributions to the CCF
   degradation from STP and the signal attenuation is conducted. A new
   method based on the phases of space-time filter weights is presented and
   is shown to reduce the distortions due to STP, as supported by
   illustrative results.}},

Abstract = {{GNSS receivers are highly susceptible to structural interference sources
   such as spoofing and meaconing. Recent spoofing detection and mitigation
   methods are mainly designed to detect and neutralize a spoofing attack
   based on a stand-alone GNSS receiver processing. However, in many
   applications a communication link might exist among different receivers
   operating in the vicinity of each other that can help the countermeasure
   process. This paper proposes a network-based anti-spoofing receiver
   architecture that uses spatially distributed receivers (operating within
   a radius of few kms) connected to a Central Authenticity Verification
   (CAV) unit. The essence of this method is that the CAV unit receives
   simultaneous measurements from adjacent receivers and detects a spoofing
   attack, classifies authentic and spoofing signals based on the
   measurements received and then localizes the spoofer source. Practical
   consideration and limitation factors have been discussed. Some
   experimental results are provided to demonstrate the applicability of
   the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Many researches on ionosphere reconstruction and mitigation have been
   carried out based on GPS or GLONASS. Apart from Total Electron Content
   (TEC) reconstruction with a single satellite system, some investigations
   have been made to the improvement of regional TEC modeling by combining
   GPS/GLONASS with more visible satellites and better coverage of
   Ionosphere Pierce Point (IPP). The results show that the TEC can be
   reconstructed more accurately with the aid of GLONASS. Since the first
   launch in October 2000, the Chinese BeiDou satellite navigation system
   has now become an important and popular member of GNSS community with a
   good coverage in Asian-Pacific area. The capacity of the BeiDou to
   monitor the TEC is of great interest to the GNSS community and some
   reported results show that the BeiDou alone is able to provide
   comparative performance where GPS system has an error levelled at
   several TECU within China. But there are still limited investigations on
   combined GPS/BeiDou for regional TEC monitoring.
   The main objective of this paper is to investigate the performance of
   the regional TEC determination by combined GPS/BeiDou in both
   positioning and TEC domains, including both TEC reconstruction and
   validation. Several challenges must be addressed in using GPS/BeiDou for
   precise TEC modeling with a regional network, such as the totally
   separation of TEC parameters and Inter-Frequency Bias (IFB) of receivers
   and satellites and the additional IFB datum constraint. For the TEC
   reconstruction, the Geometry Free (GF) pseudorange code (P4) and carrier
   phase (L4) combinations for both GPS and BeiDou are formed firstly to
   eliminate unrelated variables such as geometry and troposphere. A window
   based phase levelling method is then proposed to smooth the pseudorange
   data with carrier phase data. An advantage of the window based phase
   levelling is that it will be able to effectively reduce the effect of
   outliers.
   After the above data pre-processing, a Kalman Filter (KF) is developed
   based on the combined GPS/BeiDou regional network and the state
   parameters to be estimated include TEC model (polynomial function)
   parameters and IFB of receivers and satellites, and one IFB datum which
   is added as virtual observation to solve the problem of Matrix rank
   defect, in this part, different order of polynomial function and
   different IFB datum are utilized to test their effect on the separation
   of TEC parameters and IFB parameters. For the TEC validation, the
   estimated TEC will be investigated both in the TEC and positioning
   domains. In the TEC domain, the TEC interpolated from GIM is used as the
   external reference, which is independent to the regional network. In the
   positioning domain, on the other hand, the Precise Point Positioning
   (PPP) solution of the station data is used as the external reference and
   the Single Frequency Standard Point Positioning (SF-SPP) is carried out
   to verify the TEC estimates generated by the combined GPS/BeiDou
   regional network.
   Numeric analysis has been conducted to assess the performance of the
   proposed method for regional TEC modelling based on combined
   GPS/BeiDouTo investigate regional TEC modelling based on combined
   GPS/BeiDou, the network stations are divided into two groups: reference
   stations and user stations. The references stations are used to generate
   the TEC estimates while the data from the user stations are used for
   independent performance analysis of the regional TEC modelling based on
   combined GPS/BeiDou in both positioning and TEC domains. According to
   the initial results in the TEC domain, the combined
   GPS\textbackslash{}BeiDou system can obtain more accurate TEC parameters
   than those derived from single system, and fit well with those from the
   Global Ionosphere Map (GIM) provided by the Center for Orbit
   Determination of Europe (CODE). When comes to the positioning domain,
   the result from the SF-SPP demonstrates that the TEC value from the
   combined GPS/BeiDou benefits more in positioning accuracy improvement
   than using a single system, the positioning accuracy can reach 1.19m,
   1.47m and 1.76m in east, west and vertical direction correspondingly.}},

Abstract = {{Difference code biased (DCB) is one of the main errors when extracting
   total electron content (TEC) from the ionosphere observations. DCB is
   often assumed to be constant over time, e.g. over a period of two-hours
   or a day. Considering the variation of DCB during a day, the paper
   estimates and compare the ionosphere TEC estimates by modeling receiver
   DCB as a constant during a day and as a Gauss-Markov process under both
   quiet and disturbed ionospheric conditions. The results show that the
   DCB estimate can quickly converge to a relative stable value within five
   hours. Although the residuals under the disturbed ionosphere conditions
   are larger than under peace conditions, the DCB is little affected. The
   standard deviation of DCB estimates by modeling DCB as Gauss-Markov is
   smaller than that by modeling DCB as a constant.}},

Abstract = {{When using a temperature-sensing MEMS oscillator (TSMO) as clock source
   for GNSS receivers, temperature compensation can be highly beneficial
   for both acquisition and tracking, especially in the presence of fast
   temperature changes or at extreme temperatures where the influence of
   temperature on the oscillator frequency is highest. We designed a series
   of temperature measurement pre-processing filters to analyze the
   receiver phase-lock tracking as a function of filter complexity. For
   real-time applications, an application specific filter bandwidth has to
   be chosen to balance between temperature estimation latency and
   introduced noise. We also analyzed non-causal filters which are only
   suitable for post-mission processing.
   Furthermore, we demonstrate results from the usage of a TSMO for a GNSS
   receiver in carrier phase positioning mode. Results on static live GPS
   data show the feasibility to reliably track the carrier phase without
   cycle slips. Zero-baseline and short-baseline differential static
   positioning show the position accuracy and noise of a receiver in
   comparison to a traditional crystal oscillator-based re-ceiver. Shake
   tests on static antennas further quantify the influence of accelerations
   on the receiver. Finally, kinematic road tests in a vehicle performing
   differential carrier phase positioning on a short baseline allow to
   compare the oscillator's general performance and acceleration
   sensitivity to those of traditional quartz technology oscillators.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid and random temporal fluctuations in amplitude and phase of GNSS
   signals caused when they are propagating through localized
   irregularities in electron density of the ionosphere are called
   amplitude and phase scintillation, respectively. Scintillation affects
   signal acquisition, operation of PLLs (Phase Lock Loops) while tracking,
   and can lead to carrier cycle slips, navigation data bit errors and/or
   complete loss of lock. The loss of tracking may affect the availability
   and accuracy of receiver positions for short period of time, when less
   than four satellites are available for position computation. The use of
   carrier phase measurements with cycle slips and discontinuities, under
   strong scintillation, is a challenge for scintillation monitoring
   applications. Monitoring the ionosphere using GNSS signals is an
   important application in space-weather monitoring to understand
   scintillation effects on receiver operation and its performance.
   This paper analyzes the Kalman Filter (KF) based tracking performance of
   combined GPS L-1, L-2C and L-5 signal tracking by taking advantage of
   the dispersive nature of the ionosphere. It also incorporates an
   adaptive algorithm for combined L-1-L-2C-L-5 KF tracking in which the KF
   self-tunes the covariance matrix based on scintillation indices. To
   evaluate performance of the combined KF based tracking algorithm, its
   probability of loss of lock and tracking jitter are compared with that
   of single frequency KF based tracking algorithm for both adaptive and
   non-adaptive cases.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-frequency multi-constellation approaches exploiting modernized
   signals are planned for near future radio occultation (RO) missions
   (e.g., COSMIC-II). Thus it is desirable to employ the most optimal
   combinations of robust observations for more accurate RO retrievals.
   Some missions have proposed the use of only L1 (e.g. GPS L1CA and
   Galileo E1) and L5 (GPS L5 and Galileo E5) for efficiency. Yet recent
   studies have shown L5 may be susceptible to external sources of
   interference which compromise signal quality and availability. Given the
   major investments required to conduct RO missions and the limited amount
   or even complete lack of L2C, L5, E1, E5 etc. data from operational
   missions, it is crucial to investigate the ionospheric scintillation
   impact on RO receiver designs and consider mitigation methods - such as
   real-time scintillation monitoring, observation weighting schemes,
   and/or robust tracking schemes.
   Real RO data from e-POP GAP shows significant degradation in receiver
   performance during ionospheric scintillations. The effects are more on
   tracking L2P(Y), where they may cause complete loss of signal for
   several minutes. In this study we present strategies for characterizing
   ionospheric scintillation impact on GNSS signals for RO receivers. These
   measures of scintillation can be used as feedback within the receiver to
   switch between signal tracking modes and estimate weighting of
   observations in optimal linear combinations for the atmospheric
   retrievals. We compare various methods for scintillation
   characterization on new frequencies for space-based RO observations. Our
   analysis includes scintillation severity measurement, signal detrending
   methods, and independent vs. aiding tracking mode comparison. Our
   results confirm the dependence of scintillation measurements on signal
   detrending method. Among different methods introduced in this study,
   wavelet filtering shows good agreement with theoretical values. Also we
   show RO L2C signal is affected more by ionospheric scintillation and in
   severe conditions the receiver tracking loop is unable to remain locked
   on this signal. However by applying L1-aiding strategy, receiver
   performance increases significantly in its ability to acquire and track
   L2C signal.}},

Abstract = {{Real data has been collected from space demonstrating the CanX-2
   receiver's ability to track the WAAS, EGNOS, GAGAN, and MSAS systems.
   Two types of analysis were performed, in order to assess the suitability
   of SBAS ranging measurements as a source of positioning information for
   users in geostationary and other higher orbits, in which SBAS satellites
   may be permanently in view while GPS visibility is severely limited by
   the shape of the transmit gain patterns.
   The first analysis, of the transmit gain patterns of the EGNOS, WAAS,
   MSAS and GAGAN systems, revealed that all the SBAS satellites transmit
   enough power to be tracked over the earth's limb. It was revealed that
   GAGAN has a narrower gain pattern than the other SBAS systems. WAAS and
   EGNOS appear to have similar gain patterns but WAAS has a higher
   transmit power by 2-4 dB, and MSAS appears to transmit lower signal
   power than the other systems but uses an antenna design providing more
   even global coverage which results in and stronger power transmitted
   towards the edge of the earth.
   The second study determined that the SBAS ranging capability was useable
   in space, provided that the fast correction data transmitted by the SBAS
   satellites is applied in addition to the MT9 broadcast ephemeris. The
   SBAS ranging residuals were assessed compared to GPS single point
   position solutions in space and on the ground, and were found to agree
   to within +/- 10 m in most cases for WAAS and +/- 20 m for MSAS and
   GAGAN. EGNOS does not support ranging.
   Provided the lower accuracy compared to GPS is taken into account, the
   SBAS systems could be used to provide positioning and timing information
   to users in GEO or other orbits above the MEO GNSS constellations.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper two independent inverters are used to extend the Constant
   Power Speed Region (CPSR) for a concentrated open winding IPM
   synchronous motor (IPMSM). The IPMSM uses a v-shaped magnet arrangement
   on the rotor and is optimized to provide constant power over a speed
   range up to eight times rated speed. The circuit uses an inverter
   connected to a DC supply (the main bridge) and a floating DC link (the
   floating bridge). Applying this circuit the theoretical constant power
   region can be extended to above 11 times the base speed. Finite Element
   Analysis (FEA) is employed to evaluate the machine performance and its
   different parameters with the dual inverter structure. Loss analysis and
   Efficiency analysis show the promising performance of the designed
   machine in single and dual inverter drive in wide range of operational

Abstract = {{Since the air density reduces as the altitude increases, operation of
   Small Wind Turbines (SWTs) which usually have no pitch mechanism,
   remains as a challengeable task at high altitudes due largely to the
   reduction of starting aerodynamic torque. By reducing the blades moment
   of inertia through the use of hollow blades, the study aims to mitigate
   that issue and speed up the starting. A three-bladed, 2 m diameter small
   horizontal axis wind turbine with hollow cross-section was designed for
   operating at two sites with altitude of 500 and 3,000 m. The design
   variables consist of distribution of the chord, twist and shell
   thickness along the blade. The blade-element momentum theory was
   employed to calculate the output power and starting time and, the beam
   theory was used for the structural analysis to investigate whether the
   hollow blades could withstand the aerodynamic and centrifugal forces. A
   combination of the starting time and the output power was included in an
   objective function and then, the genetic algorithm was used to find a
   blade for which the output power and the starting performance, the goals
   of the objective function, are high while the stress limitation, the
   objective function constraint, is also met. While the resultant stresses
   remain below the allowable stress, results show that the performance of
   the hollow blades is far, better than the solid ones such that their
   starting time is shorter than the solid blades by approximately 70\%.
   However, in the presence of the generator resistive torque, the
   algorithm could not find the blade for the altitude near to 3000 m. To
   solve that problem, the tip speed ratio of the turbine was added to
   other design variables and another optimization process was done which
   led to the optimal blades not only for the lower altitude but also for
   the higher one.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: We aim to characterize infarct volume evolution within the
   first month post-ischemic stroke and to determine the effect of
   recanalization status on early infarct volume estimation.
   Methods: Ischemic stroke patients recruited for the MONITOR and VISION
   studies were retrospectively screened and patients who had infarcts on
   diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) at baseline and had at least two
   follow-up MR scans (n = 56) were included. Pre-defined target imaging
   time points, obtained on a 3-T MR scanner, were 12 hours (h), 24 h, 7
   days, and >= 30 days post-stroke. Infarct tissue was manually traced
   blinded to the images at the other time points. Infarct expansion index
   was calculated by dividing infarct volume at each follow-up time point
   by the baseline DWI infarct volume. Recanalization was assessed within
   24 h post-stroke. Correlation and statistical comparison analysis were
   done using the Spearman, Mann-Whitney, and Kruskal-Wallis tests.
   Results: Follow-up infarct volumes were positively correlated with the
   baseline infarct volume (rho > 0.81; p < 0.001) where the strongest
   correlation existed between baseline and 7-day post-stroke infarct
   volumes (rho = 0.92; p < 0.001). The strongest correlation among the
   follow-up imaging was found between infarct volumes 7-day post-stroke
   and = 30-day time points (rho = 0.93; p < 0.001). Linear regression
   showed a close-to unity slope between 7-day and final infarct volumes
   (slope = 1.043; p < 0.001). Infarct expansion was higher in the
   non-recanalized group than the recanalized group at the 7-day (p =
   0.001) and >= 30-day (p = 0.038) time points.
   Conclusions: Final infarct volume can be approximated as early as 7 days
   post-stroke. Final infarct volume approximation is significantly
   associated with recanalization status. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published

   The features were extracted from preprocessed regions of interest (ROIs)

   represent five different patterns of DPDs and normal lung tissue. A
   Gaussian mixture model (GMM) was constructed for each feature, with six

   the GMMs of the five significant features were used. From the GMMs,
   fuzzy membership functions were obtained by a probability-possibility
   transformation and further statistical analysis was performed. An
   average classification accuracy of 63. 5\% was obtained for the six
   classes. For four of the six classes, the classification accuracy was
   superior to 65\%, and the best classification accuracy was 75. 5\% for
   one class. The use of fuzzy membership functions to assist in pattern
   classification is an alternative to deterministic approaches to explore

Abstract = {{Fractures with partial collapse of vertebral bodies are generically
   referred to as ``vertebral compression fractures{''} or VCFs. VCFs can
   have different etiologies comprising trauma, bone failure related to
   osteoporosis, or metastatic cancer affecting bone. VCFs related to
   osteoporosis (benign fractures) and to cancer (malignant fractures) are
   commonly found in the elderly population. In the clinical setting, the
   differentiation between benign and malignant fractures is complex and
   difficult. This paper presents a study aimed at developing a system for
   computer-aided diagnosis to help in the differentiation between
   malignant and benign VCFs in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We used
   T1-weighted MRI of the lumbar spine in the sagittal plane. Images from
   47 consecutive patients (31 women, 16 men, mean age 63 years) were
   studied, including 19 malignant fractures and 54 benign fractures.
   Spectral and fractal features were extracted from manually segmented
   images of 73 vertebral bodies with VCFs. The classification of malignant
   vs. benign VCFs was performed using the k-nearest neighbor classifier
   with the Euclidean distance. Results obtained show that combinations of
   features derived from Fourier and wavelet transforms, together with the
   fractal dimension, were able to obtain correct classification rate up to
   94.7\% with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve up to
   0.95.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of simultaneously achieving high
   spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) in the heterogeneous
   radio access technology (RAT) environment via biased intra-and inter-RAT
   offloading. An analytical framework is developed for investigating the
   SE and EE performance of a two-RAT heterogeneous network (HetNet), based
   on which it is shown that the feasibility of increasing the SE and EE
   via offloading is strongly dependent on the load level and the biased
   offloading factors. For jointly maximizing the SE and EE, a
   multi-objective optimization problem subject to quality of service (QoS)
   constraints is formulated and solved to give the Pareto optimal
   operational regime in terms of the network parameters. Following this,
   the constrained Pareto regime is used to quantify the tradeoff between
   SE and EE as an opportunity cost measure. By opportunistically adapting
   the small cell BS density and biased offloading factors to the load
   conditions, we numerically show the range of load values that achieves a
   good balance in the SE-EE tradeoff while satisfying the specified users'
   QoS requirements.}},

Abstract = {{An adaptive nonlinear robust controller for a novel highly manoeuverable
   dual-ducted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is considered in this paper.
   The dynamics of the UAV is highly nonlinear and not originally in the
   control-affine form. At first, the equations governing the dynamics of
   the UAV are extracted. Then, a change of variables is proposed to
   transform the dynamic equations into the control-affine form. It is
   assumed that the system is subject to unknown disturbances. Therefore, a
   control law enabling the UAV to accomplish tracking missions, alongside
   an adaptive law, estimating unknown disturbances has been derived.
   Unlike previous nonlinear robust methods applied to UAVs of this kind,
   the asymptotic stability of the controller in the presence of an unknown
   disturbance is analytically demonstrated. The designed controller
   enables the UAV to follow the desired translational and rotational
   trajectories. In addition, it accounts for a range of unknown
   disturbances. Finally, a computerized simulation is conducted to verify
   the analytical results.}},

Abstract = {{Societal expectations of twenty-first century engineers have
   dramatically changed over the past few decades. There is a need to
   educate engineers not just in technical subjects, but also in many
   non-technical areas including globalization, communication, and
   leadership. There has been a growth of engineering leadership education
   programs offered by postsecondary engineering institutions. The
   effectiveness of these programs is often measured by the student's
   acquisition of skills, without considering the benefit of these skills
   on the students' careers. Using the career success competencies model,
   this paper seeks to determine if engineering leadership education
   impacts career success. The theoretical mapping analysis indicated a
   positive relationship between engineering leadership education and
   career success. The most significant competencies related to an
   engineer's career success were career insight, proactive personality,
   openness to experience, and lifelong learning.}},

Abstract = {{RF-FPGAs and field-programmable filter arrays require tunable analog
   filters that can be digitally reconfigured in real-time to have several
   user-selected passbands and stopband notches. Such reconfigurable analog
   filters must operate in the microwave frequencies up to several GHz in
   order to meet the needs of emerging cognitive radio and reconfigurable
   radar front-ends. Tunable passive filters based on RF-MEMS, surface
   acoustic wave-and planar-technologies have been explored in the recent
   past to achieve this goal. In this paper, a novel RF-IC approach to
   design microwave filterbanks having multiple bands, each having
   independently tunable center frequency and quality factors, is proposed.
   The proposed technique is based on transfer function synthesis using
   first-order all-pass filters as a building block. Using measured data
   from a current-mode 130-nm CMOS all-pass filter implementation, the
   feasibility of multi-band tunable filter arrays is simulated with a
   tuning range of 4 GHz.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of integrated expansion planning is the problem of finding
   the optimum generation mix to meet the future energy demand with least
   cost. Different energy systems are traditionally assumed independent and
   planning is carried out separately. However, recently more attention is
   paid into the interdependencies of energy systems such as electricity
   and natural gas. In this paper, the demand for electricity and heat is
   taken into account to plan for the future installation and operation of
   electricity generation, the combined heat and power units (CHPs), and
   boilers. The problem is modeled as an optimization problem to minimize
   the installation and operation cost over a 20-year horizon. The proposed
   model is then tested on the Alberta energy system. The simulation
   results indicate the advantages of integrated planning over the
   non-integrated planning in terms of cost and GHG emissions.}},

   formulated as a constrained optimization problem, with a time domain
   based cost function to be minimized using BA optimization. Effectiveness
   of the proposed BA tuned FPSSs (BAFPSSs) in damping power systems
   oscillations is verified in a multimachine power system under different

   compared against conventional designed PSSs and FPSSs tuned with the

Abstract = {{This paper describes a method of vehicle state prediction for an
   autonomous high-speed off-road Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV). Effective
   vehicle state prediction will allow a UGV to plan its navigation such
   that states (such as vertical acceleration induced by the terrain
   roughness) never exceed a desired threshold. In this paper a model of an
   n-wheeled generic vehicle is used determine its dynamics. Using a known
   terrain input profile the vehicle's output states are predicted using
   the developed n-wheel model. Simulated results of this vehicle state
   prediction approach are presented, as well as experimental tests using a
   UGV platform called Loc8. The experimental results used a 3D point cloud
   to determine the terrain input profile. Methods from the literature are
   tested against the developed n-wheeled vehicle state prediction method.
   Results show this n-wheel technique presents both advantages and
   disadvantages in comparison with existing techniques. The proposed
   approach predicts the average absolute acceleration much closer to the
   measured average absolute acceleration than existing approaches.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an efficient envelope delta-sigma based transmitter
   architecture with gate bias modulation for modern wireless communication
   systems. Using this architecture, envelope varying signals are converted
   to constant envelope signals. The constant envelope phase signal is
   up-converted and amplified utilizing high efficiency power amplifier,
   while the two level delta-sigma modulated envelope signal is used to
   switch the gate of the power amplifier. To validate the proposed
   technique, a prototype transmitter is implemented and evaluated. A
   Long-Term Evolution (LTE) uplink signal with the bandwidth of 3.84 MHz
   and the peak-to average power ratio (PAPR) of 7 dB is used to validate
   the linearity and efficiency performance of the transmitter setup. Using
   the LTE uplink signal, the polar architecture with modulated gate bias
   is able to achieve the average drain efficiency of 48\% and PAE of 42\%
   at the output power of 25.5dBm. The adjacent channel leakage ratio
   (ACLR) measured for this signal is less than -31dBc at 10 MHz offset

Abstract = {{A current-mode CMOS design is proposed for realizing receive mode
   multi-beams in the analog domain using a novel DFT approximation.
   High-bandwidth CMOS RF transistors are employed in low-voltage current
   mirrors to achieve bandwidths exceeding 4 GHz with good beam fidelity.
   Current mirrors realize the coefficients of the considered DFT
   approximation, which take simple values in \{0, +/- 1, +/- 2\} only.
   This allows high bandwidths realizations using simple circuitry without
   needing phase-shifters or delays. The proposed design is used as a
   method to efficiently achieve spatial discrete Fourier transform
   operation across a ULA to obtain multiple simultaneous RF beams. An
   example using 1.2 V current-mode approximate DFT on 65 nm CMOS, with
   BSIM4 models from the RF kit, show potential operation up to 4 GHz with
   eight independent aperture beams.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter presents multi-scale models of the reactions that occur in
   the in situ oil sands upgrading process. Its focus is on the various
   modelling tools and their applications to the benzene hydrogenation
   reactions catalyzed by molybdenum carbide nanoparticles. As the reaction
   mechanism of benzene hydrogenation on molybdenum carbide is not clear,
   we start with density functional theory (DFT) studies to elucidate the
   reaction mechanism, using both periodic and cluster models. Benzene
   hydrogenation on molybdenum carbide follows the Langmuir-Hinshelwood
   mechanism, with the six-member ring tilting up gradually. A
   tight-binding quantum chemical molecular dynamics (TB-QCMD) method is
   used to track the physical motion of the atoms in the reaction processes
   of C6H6 on a Mo-terminated alpha-Mo2C (0001) surface. The approximate
   DFT method, density functional tight-binding (DFTB), was parameterized
   to allow the quantum mechanical treatment of nanoscale systems. With the
   nudged elastic band method, the potential energy profiles of benzene
   hydrogenation on molybdenum carbide nanoparticles have been obtained.
   Finally a force field was brought in to describe the solvent environment
   in the system, leading to a multiscale quantum mechanical/molecular
   mechanical (QM/MM) model. This study suggests that entropy and the
   environment play important roles in heterogeneous reactions catalyzed by
   molybdenum carbide nanoparticles.}},

Abstract = {{A new wetness index (WI) was developed based on the temporal patterns in
   radar brightness (beta(0)) in a timeseries of RADARSAT-1 ScanSAR images
   collected over the July-September period of 2005. The WI proposed here
   provided an indirect measure of soil water content (SWC), as beta(0) was
   documented to vary with land-surface water content. Hydrological factors
   affecting SWC, such as soil texture, topography, evapotranspiration,
   etc., were not considered in the current determination of WI. WI-values
   generated with the proposed method were subsequently compared against
   field measurements of SWC collected from three separate areas, including
   densely-and sparsely-forested and non-forested areas (i.e., bare
   fields), all located in southcentral New Brunswick (NB), Canada. The
   comparison revealed adequate agreement between WI and SWC for all three
   areas, including dense forests, yielding coefficients of determination
   (r(2)'s) of 74-99 \%. Reasonable agreement for dense forests (r(2) = 74
   \%) indicated the potential of the method in determining SWC under
   heavily-vegetated conditions. This correlation would arise because of
   the equilibrium established between foliage water content (picked up by
   the radar signal) and SWC under normal, non-stressed conditions. A
   second evaluation of the method was conducted by comparing WI-values
   with spatial calculations of SWC obtained with the Soil Water Assessment
   Tool (SWAT) for bare-field conditions common to the potato-growing area
   of northwestern NB. Again, suitable agreement was obtained, yielding
   r(2)-values ranging from 65 \% to 81 \%. However, further research is
   needed to evaluate the usefulness of the method for other forested and
   non-forested regions of the world. In principle, because the method
   relies mostly on beta(0), it is highly likely the method can be used to
   assess SWC in many different types of natural environments.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling and simulation of transportation systems are extensively used
   because of high costs and potential safety and security issues
   associated with its prototyping in a real traffic. Modeling and
   simulation play a key role in understanding real systems through
   abstraction and evaluating new technologies. In this paper, we conducted
   a simulationbased analysis to assess potential benefits of applying
   pattern recognition in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). We used
   integrated transport modeling and simulation software called AIMSUN to
   develop a model for a real highway road. We also developed a number of
   plug-in software modules which implement pattern recognition, route
   guidance, and message communication features. We used the developed
   model in two congestion-oriented scenarios, called reactive and
   proactive. The simulation results were promising and showed that
   integrating pattern recognition into transportation systems improves
   mobility, reduces travel time, and reduces congestion resolution time.
   In particular, there is 5\% to 30\% reduction in the average travel time
   and 8\% to 41\% reduction in the average congestion resolution time.}},

Abstract = {{The inverter is a major component of a renewable energy system and its
   performance affects the overall performance of the system. For typical
   household applications in remote areas, often there is need to operate
   at low power conditions where inverter efficiency can drop dramatically.
   Efficient operation at low power is important especially for stand-alone
   applications in developing countries where system cost must be kept low.
   In this paper, we investigated the impact of switching frequency upon
   switching loss for a single-phase Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation
   (SPWM) inverter. Results show that reducing the switching frequency
   reduces switching loss at low power levels thus improving inverter
   efficiency. This may result in a reduced PV module size requirement and
   thus lower system cost. In addition, efficient low power inverters would
   allow the continued operation of essential lighting when the battery
   bank is nearly discharged. A mathematical model is given to calculate
   the major loss components (i. e. switching loss, conduction loss) in the
   system. The inverter is operated in the range of 200W rated power to 9W
   (4.5 \% of the rated power) along with the change in frequency from 20
   kHz to 200 Hz.}},

   electric power to consumers' centers mainly in south west Addis Ababa.
   Maximum loading of the outbound feeders from the Substation to the
   Medium Voltage distribution transformers located at different load
   centers were examined during peak load hours. Along the selected routes,
   with all transformers loaded to their 60\% capacities, the total nominal
   power losses in the feeders and the transformers were also appraised.
   Alternative technical power loss reduction techniques have been studied
   with different loading considerations. Further simulation studies

Abstract = {{In this study, the lattice Boltzmann method is utilized to investigate
   the effects of porous medium at the exit of the counterflow combustion.
   Porous matrices with different arrangements are created by scattering
   solid obstacles inside the flow path. The LBM model is used for
   simulation of conduction heat transfer between the discrete parts of the
   porous medium. A single-step chemical reaction is used for modeling of
   the combustion of propane/air mixture and properties are recorded at the
   exit of the domain. However, to investigate the effects of porous media
   on the emission of the intermediate species like CO, a two-step chemical
   reaction is utilized to model the methane/air combustion. The results
   show that the presence of the porous media decreases the maximum exit
   temperature and causes a more uniform temperature profile at the exit
   compared with results of combustion without porous medium. Also,
   utilizing porous media reduces the CO and unburned fuel concentration at
   the exit and consequently increases the combustion efficiency. Effects
   of the different porous structure on exit temperature and species
   concentrations are also investigated in this study.}},

Abstract = {{The placement problem has become challenging due to a variety of
   complicated constraints imposed by modern process technologies. Some of
   the most challenging constraints were highlighted during the ISPD 2015
   placement contest and include fence region and target density
   constraints; these constraints are in addition to those issues that
   affect detailed routability such as pin shorts, pin access problems and
   cell spacing issues. These constraints not only make cell placement more
   difficult, but can impact the placement objectives such as wire length,
   routability and so forth. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
   technique to address fence region constraints in global placement and
   legalization while still considering detailed-routing issues. We combine
   concepts from image processing such as region coloring with parallel
   programming to efficiently deal with fence regions. We also introduce a
   heuristic method to adjust target densities while avoiding adverse
   effects on the quality of global routability. Numerical results using
   both the released and hidden benchmarks from the ISPD 2015 placement
   contest demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed techniques.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, laser scanning systems have been recognized as a fast
   and accurate technology for the acquisition of high density spatial
   data. The advent of these systems has reduced the cost and increased the
   availability of accurate 3D data for mapping, modelling, and monitoring
   applications. The original laser scanning data does not explicitly
   provide meaningful information about the characteristics of the scanned
   surfaces. Therefore, reliable processing procedures are applied for
   information extraction from these datasets. However, the derived
   surfaces through laser scanning data processing cannot be effectively
   interpreted due to the lack of spectral information. To resolve this
   problem, a new texturing procedure is introduced in this paper to
   improve the interpretability of laser scanning-derived surfaces using
   spectral information from overlapping imagery. In this texturing
   approach, individual planar regions, derived through a laser scanning
   data segmentation procedure, are textured using the available imagery.
   This texturing approach, which aims to overcome the computational
   inefficiency of the previously-developed point-based texturing
   techniques, is implemented in three steps. In the first step, the
   visibility of the segmented planar regions in the available imagery is
   checked and a list of appropriate images for texturing each planar
   region is established. An occlusion detection procedure is then
   performed to identify the parts of the segmented regions which are
   occluding/being occluded by other regions in the field of view of the
   utilized images. In the second step, visible parts of planar regions are
   decomposed into parts which should be textured using individual images.
   Finally, a rendering procedure is performed to texture these parts using
   available images. Experimental results from real laser scanning dataset
   and overlapping imagery demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed
   approach for texturing laser scanning-derived surfaces using images.}},

Abstract = {{Polyethylene (PE) is widely used to make bulk containers in rotational
   molding process. The challenge in this study is to improve permeation
   resistance of PE to hydrocarbon solvents and gases. Adding
   organomodified clay improves the thermal, barrier and mechanical
   properties of PE. In fact, clay layers create a tortuous path against
   the permeant, yielding better barrier properties. Due to the non-polar
   hydrophobic nature of PE and polar hydrophilic structure of clay
   minerals, the compatibilizer plays a crucial role to enhance the
   dispersion level of clay in the matrix. In this study High Density
   Polyethylene (HDPE) and Linear Low Density Polyethylene (LLDPE) layered
   silicate nanocomposite were melt-compounded with two concentrations of
   organomodified clay (2 and 4 wt. \%). The interaction between nanoclay,
   compatibilizer and rotomolding grade of PE were examined by using X-ray
   diffraction, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and rheology test.
   Rheology was used to determine the performance of our material at low

Abstract = {{Aerobic granules, a relatively new form of microbial aggregate, can be
   formed with bacteria or fungi as the dominant population, depending on
   operational conditions. In this study, a comprehensive comparison is
   conducted between these two kinds of granules. Bacterial granules (BG)
   were formed after 3 weeks of cultivation, and exhibited a settling
   velocity and ash content of 5.6 cm s(-1) and 24\%, respectively. In
   contrast, fungal granule (FG) cultivation took only 5 days, and their
   settling velocity and ash content were 45\% and 22\% of BG,
   respectively. BG and FG selectively enriched calcium and potassium,
   respectively, and these elements were replaced by iron upon Fe(III)
   modification. Original BG had 7 times larger surface areas and 9 times
   higher pore volumes than FG, but Fe(III) modification reversed the
   trend. Original and modified granules were used as biosorbents for
   removal of Zn(II), Cu(II), Ni(II) and Sb(OH)(6)(-) at various pH levels.
   The original granules removed the cations efficiently (BG better than
   FG), but had no affinity for Sb(V) under all pH values. Fe(III)
   modification significantly enhanced Sb(V) removal by both granules, with
   the best performance achieved under pH 3.4. FG, though it had lower Fe
   loading, exhibited a comparable ultimate Sb(V) adsorption capacity to BG
   (111 vs. 125 mg g (-1)), and 3 times higher initial adsorption rate. In
   addition, FG was more stable at higher pH and showed better adsorption
   performance under pH > 4.3. Pseudo-second-order kinetics and a Langmuir
   isotherm model described the adsorption processes well for both kinds of
   modified granules, which proved to be good biosorbents.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term ephemeris extension is needed in challenging environments in
   order to reduce the Time-To-First-Fixed (TTFF). It makes quick position
   fix possible for mobile devices while they are still acquiring the
   broadcast ephemeris. Based on the experiment results described in this
   paper, the median User Range Error (URE) for the extended ephemeris
   after 3 and 7 days are 2.14m and 7.36m, respectively. Both of the
   multi-constellation extended ephemeris and its accuracy represented with
   backward errors are used for urban navigation. Simulated signal
   obstruction experiments are also conducted to assess the position fix
   accuracy, availability and reliability based on different mean square
   positional error (MSPE) thresholds, prediction durations and obstruction
   scenarios. The results have demonstrated superior performance for
   multiple constellation navigation system with backward error
   representation method compared to the GPS only system without backward
   error representation. With the aid of multiple constellation, the
   obtained average navigation availability and reliability improve from
   67.7\% to 93.4\% while the reliability also improve from 88.1\% to
   89.5\% using a user-defined MSPE of 15m after 3 days' prediction. Both
   of the average availability and reliability can further increase to
   97.1\% and 94.8\% after applying the revised strategy considering the

Abstract = {{In a GNSS/INS integrated system, the GNSS outputs, such as position and
   velocity, are used to estimate the INS navigation errors and inertial
   sensor errors and the inertial solutions are used to bridge the GNSS
   outages for which a good quality IMU is needed. Since MEMS IMU outputs
   are corrupted by significant sensor errors, the navigation errors will
   accumulate quickly which degrade the navigation solution over a short
   time period in the presence of GNSS outages. The rotary INS technique
   has been proposed to reduce the MEMS-based INS navigation errors
   recently. A rotary INS is an inertial navigator in which the IMU is
   installed on a rotation platform. By modulating the significant inertial
   sensor errors through proper IMU rotations, the accumulation of
   navigation errors can be effectively mitigated without a need for
   external aiding. Based on the previous work on MEMS-based rotary INS,
   this paper proposed an integrated system of GNSS and rotary INS. Given
   the ability of a rotary INS to extend autonomous navigation, the
   integrated system can significantly improve the navigation performance
   to bridge GNSS outages under GNSS-challenging environments, such as
   vehicles travelling through tunnels. Based on a single-axis rotation
   table, road kinematic tests are conducted to evaluate the performance of
   the proposed system using two different MEMS IMUs (MTi-G from Xsens and
   NAV440 from Moog Crossbow). The results indicate that the IMU rotation
   can reduce the horizontal position errors by about 2 times for the
   system with MTi-G and about 3 times for the system with NAV440 during
   the period of GNSS outages.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the estimation of heading information of
   the Pedestrian Navigation System (PNS). The MEMS inertial sensors as
   well as a miniature GNSS receiver are used to establish a pedestrian
   navigation prototype based on the Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR)
   approach. An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) structure is used for the
   estimation of the system's attitude error and the bias of the gyroscope.
   If there is no external acceleration, errors of pitch and roll as well
   as the biases of the two horizontal gyros are compensated using the
   aiding information from the accelerometer. When GNSS is available, its
   output is used for heading and heading-gyro bias estimation. Using the
   aiding information provided by both GNSS and accelerometer, the proposed
   method prevents the errors in the attitude from increasing rapidly. The
   proposed method for pedestrian navigation application has been well
   verified through real field experiments.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we show that grafted metal oxide can be a highly
   cost-effective and active anode for solid oxide fuel cells for sour
   methane conversion. The developed electro-catalyst was composed of
   vanadium oxide grafted TiO2 nanopartides (VOx/TiO2) infiltrated into a
   porous La0.4Sr0.5Ba0.1TiO3,5 electron-conductive composite. A number of
   chemisorbed vanadia species on TiO2 have been identified by XRD, FTIR,
   XPS and ToF-SIMS anaEyses; the morphoEogies of grafted TiO2 nanopartides
   were characterized using SEM and TEM. The thermal stability of vanadia
   was greatly enhanced due to strong binding interaction with the support.
   In the chemical activity investigation using a fixed bed catalytic
   reactor, VOx/TiO2 showed significantly improved activity towards sour
   methane gas (0.5\% H2S + CH4) oxidation in a diluted stream of oxygen.
   The Eectrochemical activity was determined using a SOFC that empEoyed
   the VOx/TiO2 infiltrated titanate anode. This cell had a maximum power
   density of 160 mW cm(-2) and a non-ohmic poEarization resistance of <1
   cm(2) in 0.5\% H2S + CH4. Additionay, the performance of the novel anode
   materiaE did not degrade during the 24 h test at 0.7 V with VOx/TiO2
   suppressing coke formation on the anode.}},

Abstract = {{Torrefaction is a thermo-chemical process, which is also referred to as
   a mild pyrolysis carried out at a relatively low temperature ranging
   from 200 to 300 degrees C. During the torrefaction process, the
   lignocelluloses materials, such as cellulose, hemicelluloses, and
   lignin, undergo degradation, with the maximum degradation belonging to
   hemicelluloses. The present research focuses on torrefaction of the flax
   straw under laboratory scale. Thermo gravimetric analyzer was used to
   study the effect of temperature, particle size, and residence time on
   the torrefaction of flax straw. Proximate analysis of the char remained
   after torrefaction showed a significant increase in fixed carbon and ash
   content and a noticeable decrease in the moisture and volatile content
   with an increase in the temperature. Ultimate analysis was also
   performed for the product char. The results of ultimate analysis showed
   that the maximum carbon and heating value obtained were about 61\% and
   24 x 10(3) kJ kg(-1), respectively, for higher particle size (1,200 mu
   m) and at higher temperature (300 degrees C). The kinetic analysis
   showed an activation energy of 76.64 kJ mol (1) for the particle size of
   925 mu m and for the residence time of 60 min. The experimental results
   of the torrefaction of flax straw indicate that the temperature has a
   greater effect on torrefaction process than the residence time and the
   particle sizes chosen for this study.}},

Abstract = {{The electrochemical corrosion of the carbon-based catalyst support
   materials used in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs),
   especially at the cathode, has a significant impact on PEMFC lifetime.
   Thus, an effective and reliable method for the evaluation of the
   corrosion resistance of new carbon supports, as they are developed, is
   required. In the present work, a novel approach that allows for the
   ranking of carbon supports for their corrosion susceptibility has been
   developed, based on the testing of a conventional microporous carbon
   material (Vulcan carbon, VC) and two ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs),
   synthesized using sucrose and anthracene as the carbon precursors. While
   cyclic voltammetry does reveal important information about surface area
   and surface oxidation changes, the charge passed during potential
   stepping between 0.8 and 1.4 V vs. RHE was found to be still more
   informative, with the cathodic charge used to continuously correct for
   the changing surface area of the carbon during its oxidation. Based on
   this approach, it was found that VC, which is the more crystalline
   material, is more stable to oxidation than the OMCs, as expected, while
   the anthracene precursor leads to a more stable OMC than when sucrose is
   used. (C) The Author(s) 2015. Published by ECS. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{19}},

Pages = {{413-422}},
Abstract = {{The practice of disposing of waste in conventional dry-tomb landfills is
   not sustainable. A sustainable alternative is the landfill bioreactor
   and its variations. Landfill bioreactor approach includes specific
   design and operation techniques to enhance waste degradation and
   landfill gas (LFG) production. Although this approach has been known to
   landfill researchers and practitioners for a few decades, there are only
   a few successful field-scale landfill bioreactors in operation. This
   paper provides a comprehensive review of technological challenges with
   landfill bioreactors and associated design and operational details. A
   key issue that should be addressed by a landfill bioreactor designer is
   moisture and gas movement within a waste matrix that changes its
   properties continuously in time and space. The design components such as
   the leachate collection and removal system (LCRS), leachate
   recirculation system, and gas collection system could be severely
   impacted if the traditional landfill design and operation practice is
   not modified to take into consideration the behavior of waste matrix in
   time and space. Considering that a landfill bioreactor can be used as a
   biomass waste to energy facility, this paper details the LFG generation
   processes, the factors affecting the LFG generation and theoretical LFG
   generation estimation techniques as well as the important design,
   construction and operational issues associated with landfill

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY}},

Abstract = {{Long-term effectiveness of rock wettability alteration for water removal
   during gas production from tight reservoir depends on the surfactant
   adsorption on the pore surface of a reservoir. This paper selected
   typical cationic fluorosurfactant FW-134 as an example and took
   advantage of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic force microscope (AFM) to
   investigate its adsorption stability on the rock mineral surface under
   the oscillation condition at high temperature for a long time. The
   experimental results indicate that the F element content on the sample
   surface increases obviously, the surface structure of
   fluorine-carbonization also undergoes a significant change, and the
   fluorine surfactant exhibits a good interfacial modification and
   wettability alteration ability due to its adsorption on the pore surface
   transforming the chemical structure of the original surface. The
   adsorption increases indistinctly with the concentration of over 0.05\%
   due to a single layer adsorption structure and is mainly electrostatic
   adsorption because the chemical bonding between the fluorosurfactant and
   the rock mineral surface, the hydrogen bonding, is weak and

Abstract = {{Recent structures struck by earthquakes revealed the deficiencies of
   their reinforced concrete (RC) column members to avoid progressive
   failure scenarios. Therefore, strengthening RC column is paramount to
   ensure the structural integrity and public safety in future events of

   strengthening materials and techniques with more efficient and effective
   ones had led to the evolvement of smarter and innovative class of
   materials termed Shape Memory Alloys (SMA). The SMA possesses unique

Abstract = {{The Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) are rarely used in structural engineering
   applications due to the high cost of constitutive materials and
   production schemes. Recently, the Iron-Based SMA (Fe-SAM) is being
   developed. The inexpensive constitutive materials of the Fe-SMA and the
   availability of mass production facilities of steel products makes this
   material suitable for large structural engineering applications than the
   most common shape memory alloys (i.e. NiTi). SMAs are mainly
   characterized by the Shape Memory Effect (SME) phenomenon. The SME
   represents the ability of the SMA to recover its original shape after
   being deformed beyond the elastic limits through heating. The SME for
   some SMAs can be further improved by the thermo-mechanical training.
   This paper reports on the effect of thermo-mechanical training of Fe-SMA
   bars used for flexural strengthening of Reinforced Concrete (RC) beam
   using the Near-Surface Mounted (NSM) strengthening technique. The
   pre-strained Fe-SMA bar was anchored inside a groove in the tension face
   of the RC beam and then heated up to 350 degrees C where the activation
   of the bar occurred causing a prestressing force to be developed in the
   Fe-SMA bar that counteracts the applied loads. The results were compared
   with another beam strengthened with Fe-SMA without thermo-mechanical
   training of the bar. The results revealed a better performance at
   service loads in the case of the beam strengthened with trained NSM
   Fe-SMA bar.}},

Abstract = {{The Digital Image Correlation Technique (DICT) was recently proposed as
   an alternative instrumentation to conventional Linear Strain Conversion
   devices due to the superior characteristics of the former in accurately
   capturing the deformation in structures. In this research, the DICT was
   used to calculate the member contributions of slotted-beam column
   connections tested under quasi-static loading. The slotted-beam system
   is primarily used in the design of concrete structures prone to
   high-magnitude earthquake motions. It possesses exceptional minimal beam
   elongation and non-tearing action to the concrete slabs, and thus,
   maintains a rigid diaphragm of building floors. The detailed procedure
   of calculating the member contributions using the DICT method is
   outlined in this paper. Analysis results indicate the domination of beam
   flexural bending to the total drift with smaller contribution of the
   joint distortion and column bending.}},

Abstract = {{Slotted beam-column connection was developed recently as an alternative
   system for the seismic design of connections in concrete structures. The
   system includes a vertical slot made into the beam member at the column
   face, while its main feature is that the bottom reinforcement yields
   under both positive and negative bending, and thus, the top
   reinforcement remains elastic during the seismic motion. Therefore, the
   elongation of the beam member, which is an important parameter in the
   performance of beam-column connections, is maintained insignificant. The
   elastic response of the top fiber will also provide a non-tearing action
   to the attached concrete slab. In this research, nonlinear 3D Finite
   Element Method (FEM) models were developed and validated against
   experimental test results of large scale slotted beam-column
   connections. The results of the models are analyzed in terms of
   load-displacement relationships, beam rotation, strain profiles, and
   cracking pattern. It is concluded that further research into the effect
   of relocating the vertical slots, away from the column face, on the
   accuracy of the models in predicting the response of the system is
   needed before being able to conduct parametric studies using the FEM
   models.}},

   introduce a temporal probability grid network generated from the taxi

   Adaptive Shortest Expected Cruising Route (ASECR) algorithm is proposed.
   ASECR recommends profitable routes based on assigned potential
   profitable grids and updates the profitable route constantly based on
   taxis' movements as well as utilizing the temporal probability grid
   network dynamically. To handle the big trajectory data and improve the
   efficiency of updating route constantly, a data structure kdS-tree is
   proposed and implemented for ASECR. The experiments on two real taxi

Title = {{On the Capacity of Densely Packed Arrays with Mutual Coupling and
   Correlated Noise}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Capacity of a wireless link can be enhanced by increasing the number of
   receive antennas. However, imposed receiver physical size constraints
   necessitate that the antenna elements be in close proximity, which
   typically reduces the overall link capacity of the wireless channel.
   Counterintuitively, under certain conditions the capacity of the overall
   link can be enhanced by decreasing antenna spacings. The focus of this
   paper is that of identifying the fundamental mechanisms and the
   conditions that give rise to this excess capacity. Closed-form
   expressions that directly quantify this capacity gain are derived based
   on a representative circuit theoretic model. Interesting insights are
   developed about the impact of different noise and interference sources
   and the limiting effect of heat losses in the antenna system. The
   capacity analysis is subsequently generalized to encompass the effect of
   antenna current deformation and load mismatch due to mutual coupling,
   based on the standard Method of Moments (MoM) analysis, demonstrating
   similar capacity enhancement behavior as predicted by the closed-form
   expressions.}},

Title = {{One-Step-Ahead Predictive Control for Hydroturbine Governor}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{The hydroturbine generator regulating system can be considered as one
   system synthetically integrating water, machine, and electricity. It is
   a complex and nonlinear system, and its configuration and parameters are
   time-dependent. A one-step-ahead predictive control based on on-line
   trained neural networks (NNs) for hydroturbine governor with variation
   in gate position is described in this paper. The proposed control
   algorithm consists of a one-step-ahead neuropredictor that tracks the
   dynamic characteristics of the plant and predicts its output and a
   neurocontroller to generate the optimal control signal. The weights of
   two NNs, initially trained off-line, are updated on-line according to
   the scalar error. The proposed controller can thus track operating
   conditions in real-time and produce the optimal control signal over the
   wide operating range. Only the inputs and outputs of the generator are
   measured and there is no need to determine the other states of the
   generator. Simulations have been performed with varying operating
   conditions and different disturbances to compare the performance of the
   proposed controller with that of a conventional PID controller and
   validate the feasibility of the proposed approach.}},

   Hydroturbine Generating Unit}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Considering the drawbacks of traditional wavelet neural network, such as
   low convergence speed and high sensitivity to initial parameters, an ant
   colony optimization- (ACO-) initialized wavelet neural network is
   proposed in this paper for vibration fault diagnosis of a hydroturbine
   generating unit. In this method, parameters of the wavelet neural
   network are initialized by the ACO algorithm, and then the wavelet
   neural network is trained by the gradient descent algorithm. Amplitudes
   of the frequency components of the hydroturbine generating unit
   vibration signals are used as feature vectors for wavelet neural network
   training to realize mapping relationship from vibration features to
   fault types. A real vibration fault diagnosis case result of a
   hydroturbine generating unit shows that the proposed method has faster
   convergence speed and stronger generalization ability than the
   traditional wavelet neural network and ACO wavelet neural network. Thus
   it can provide an effective solution for online vibration fault

Abstract = {{Polymer flooding is a commercially proven approach for enhanced oil
   recovery from mature oil fields. The fundamental mechanism of polymer
   flooding for improving oil recovery is to increase the viscosity of
   displacing fluid, thereby creating a favorable mobility ratio for
   improved volumetric sweep efficiency. Therefore, development of an
   adequate model for prediction of polymer viscosity is the successful key
   of this process. This article presents a comprehensive investigation of
   hydrolyzed polyacrylamide viscosity for a wider and better understanding
   of the polymer flooding process. A fundamental mathematic model of
   polymer viscosity in porous media is described and a series of numerical
   simulations have been done to determine the dependence of polymer
   viscosity on polymer solution properties and reservoir conditions. The
   simulation results indicate that pH, salinity, polymer concentration,
   molecular weight, and alkaline are the main parameters that strongly
   influence the viscosity of hydrolyzed polyacrylamide. With an
   appropriate control of these factors, the efficiency of chemical
   flooding will be significantly improved in both economic and technical
   aspects.}},

Abstract = {{Formation damage is a serious problem in oil and gas industries. Based
   on common reservoir damage, the conditions and factors resulting in
   damage were summarized into four categories in this paper. The worldwide
   advanced technologies applied in reservoir damage treatment are
   reviewed. For the first time, we propose the concept of injecting
   nitrogen foam into a formation to treat the damage caused by sand
   blocking. An application of Cyclic Foam Stimulation is introduced, which
   enhances productivity significantly. Experimental apparatus for the
   Cyclic Foam Stimulation was designed, which included a wellbore vessel
   that could stimulate the effect of sand setting. A reservoir vessel was
   also designed to supply the foam. Additionally, in order to simulate the
   formation damage caused by the size and distribution of fine sand, six
   artificial cores, which were porosity contrastive and sand producing,
   were prepared based on the technologies of pressure control and PVA
   membrane wrapping. The experimental results show that the foam has a
   good discharging effect on sand blockages. Moreover, the effects of the
   size and distribution of the fine sand on the porosity was studied. It
   was found that the smaller the size of the grains and the more uniform
   the grain distribution, the worse the formation porosity. A porosity
   recovery factor has been defined and the recovery rate of the porosity
   was also studied. A scientific guide for the application of Cyclic Foam
   Stimulation can be generated from the studies in this paper.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WATER REUSE AND DESALINATION}},

Volume = {{5}},

Pages = {{271-281}},
Abstract = {{Our group was approached by a manufacturer of treatment trains to
   recycle wastewater from dairy farm manure. Company X treatment trains
   consist of microscreening, sedimentation and filtration units attached
   to a reverse osmosis (RO) membrane. To enhance screening, a coagulant
   and a flocculant are added to the stream feeding the microscreen.
   However, their customers experience foaming on the microscreen as well
   as frequent fouling of the RO membranes. This study aimed to identify
   the source of foaming and to optimize the performance of the treatment
   train. Results show that interactions between the alum coagulant, the
   polymer flocculant and the contaminants are the cause of foaming.
   Addition of silicon polymer antifoam A effectively reduced foaming,
   while maintaining the same removal of total suspended solids (TSS) and
   total organic carbon (TOC). Alternatively, we proposed a new reagent
   addition scheme which circumvents back-to-back addition of the polymer
   flocculant and the alum coagulant. The proposed scheme resulted in
   significant reduction in foaming and similar to 50\% increase in TSS and
   TOC removal, even at the 40\% lower dose of the cationic polymer. In
   addition to the economic benefit, a low concentration of left-over
   polymer should alleviate the fouling of the RO membrane.}},

Pages = {{1523-1533}},
Abstract = {{Failure in layers of buried surface hoar crystals (frost) can cause
   hazardous snow slab avalanches. Surface hoar crystals form on the snow
   surface and are sensitive to micro-meteorological conditions. In this
   study, the role of meteorological and terrain factors was investigated
   for three layers of surface hoar in the Columbia Mountains of Canada.
   The distribution of crystals over different elevations and aspects was
   observed on 20 days of field observations during a period of high
   pressure. The same layers were modelled over simplified terrain on a 2.5
   km horizontal grid by forcing the snow cover model SNOWPACK with
   forecast weather data from a numerical weather prediction model.
   Modelled surface hoar growth was associated with warm air temperatures,
   high humidity, cold surface temperatures, and low wind speeds. Surface
   hoar was most developed in regions and elevation bands where these
   conditions existed, although strong winds at high elevations caused some
   model discrepancies. SNOWPACK simulations on virtual slopes
   systematically predicted smaller surface hoar on south-facing slopes. In
   the field, a complex combination of surface hoar and sun crusts were
   observed, suggesting the simplified model did not adequately resolve the
   surface energy balance on slopes. Overall, a coupled weather-snow cover
   model could benefit avalanche forecasters by predicting surface hoar
   layers on a regional scale over different elevation bands.}},

Abstract = {{Smartphones are widely used at present. Most smartphones have cameras
   and kinds of sensors, such as gyroscope, accelerometer and magnet meter.
   Indoor navigation based on smartphone is very important and valuable.
   According to the features of the smartphone and indoor navigation, a new
   indoor integrated navigation method is proposed, which uses MEMS
   (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit),
   camera and magnet meter of smartphone. The proposed navigation method
   mainly involves data acquisition, camera calibration, image measurement,
   IMU calibration, initial alignment, strapdown integral, zero velocity
   update and integrated navigation. Synchronous data acquisition of the
   sensors (gyroscope, accelerometer and magnet meter) and the camera is
   the base of the indoor navigation on the smartphone. A camera data
   acquisition method is introduced, which uses the camera class of Android
   to record images and time of smartphone camera. Two kinds of sensor data
   acquisition methods are introduced and compared. The first method
   records sensor data and time with the SensorManager of Android. The
   second method realizes open, close, data receiving and saving functions
   in C language, and calls the sensor functions in Java language with JNI
   interface. A data acquisition software is developed with JDK (Java
   Development Kit), Android ADT (Android Development Tools) and NDK
   (Native Development Kit). The software can record camera data, sensor
   data and time at the same time. Data acquisition experiments have been
   done with the developed software and Sumsang Note 2 smartphone. The
   experimental results show that the first method of sensor data
   acquisition is convenient but lost the sensor data sometimes, the second
   method is much better in real-time performance and much less in data
   losing. A checkerboard image is recorded, and the corner points of the
   checkerboard are detected with the Harris method. The sensor data of
   gyroscope, accelerometer and magnet meter have been recorded about 30
   minutes. The bias stability and noise feature of the sensors have been
   analyzed. Besides the indoor integrated navigation, the integrated
   navigation and synchronous data acquisition method can be applied to
   outdoor navigation.}},

Abstract = {{A prototype urine evaporation unit (UEU) that removes water from human
   urine produced from a urine-diverting dry toilet using passive solar
   evaporation was designed and field-tested at a meteorological station.
   Municipal water was evaporated on vertically stacked plastic
   cafeteria-style trays that create a large evaporation surface with a
   small land-area footprint. The trays were located inside a Plexiglas (R)
   enclosure exposed to UV light while passively heating the UEU like a
   solar oven. A metal black chimney also heated up in the sun, causing air
   to enter the UEU at the front of the UEU through a louvered vent, flow
   across each tray, and then exit at the back up through the chimney. The
   UEU was field-tested in a semi-arid temperate climate (Calgary, Canada)
   from 22 August to 5 November 2013. The average UEU evaporation rate was
   3.2 L/day (0.66 mm), varying from 0.4 L/day (0.08 mm/day) on a cloudy
   day to 8.8 L/day (1.82 mm) on a sunny day. A multiple-regression
   analysis indicates that 63\% of the UEU evaporation rate can be
   explained by changes in air temperature, wind speed and incoming solar
   radiation, thus allowing for predictions of the UEU's relative
   evaporation potential in other climates.}},

   retardation spectra and successfully used for the description of the
   creep and recovery tests in the studied asphalt binders. Large effects
   due to oxidative aging in a rolling thin film oven were found from the
   recovered compliance function recorded in a bending beam rheometer at a
   temperature of - 20 degrees C. The studied compliance function models
   worked well at higher and lower temperatures in creep and recovery
   experiments on conventional and modified asphalt binders for both shear

Title = {{An assessment of the utility of LiDAR data in extracting base-year

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-PLANNING \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},

Abstract = {{A literature review indicates that most integrated land-use transport
   models (ILUTMs) estimate base-year floorspace data according to limited
   population and employment data provided by the census and, in general,
   the accuracy is unknown. This paper assesses the utility of airborne
   Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) technology as a valuable tool for
   extracting base-year floorspace using the following three datasets: a
   geographic vector building footprint layer, a LiDAR dataset, and field
   survey data for the south side of the City of Fredericton, Canada. It is
   found through a statistical comparison with the results from the field
   survey that LiDAR data can be used to extract buildings and estimate
   floorspace with a good degree of accuracy. Further, two base-year
   floorspace estimation methods, one based on the LiDAR data and the other
   on census data, are compared. In general, our results show that the
   traditional census-based approach may not be reliable for estimating
   base-year floorspace. Using the extracted floorspace from the LiDAR data
   as the basis, for residential floorspace estimation the average absolute
   percentage errors (APE) of the census-based approach is 16\% and the
   95th percentile APE is 34\%. On the other hand, for employment
   floorspace estimation, the accuracy of the census-based approach is even
   lower, with average errors of 50\% or higher and the 95th percentile
   APEs as high as 163\% up to 400\% for several land-use categories. All
   the above statistics indicate that the traditional census-based approach
   is unreliable and inaccurate for modelers and planners to prepare their
   base-year floorspace, and therefore suggest a better way be explored.
   Study results clearly show the utility of LiDAR data and imply that it
   can be used as a powerful add-on for ILUTMs in general.}},

Pages = {{564-580}},
Abstract = {{The Prince of Wales Fort was constructed in the 18th century as a Vauban
   style stone masonry fortification where the Churchill River flows into
   Hudson's Bay, across the river from Churchill, Manitoba, Canada. Since
   completion the fort has been exposed to harsh weather conditions, which
   have led to significant deterioration and deformations in the walls,
   with some cases of localized collapse. Recently, an increase in the rate
   of degradation has made preventative conservation an issue of interest.
   For this conservation to be possible, an understanding of the cause of
   failure of the walls is first required. Discrete element modeling (DEM)
   using the non-smooth contact dynamics (NSCD) method utilized in the
   Program LMGC90 has been used as a first step in understanding the
   failure mechanism of the wall system. The results of the modeling show
   that the rubble core of the walls can transition from stability to
   instability as the cohesion between the stones is altered. Grouting the
   core will alter the bond between stones, increasing the stability of the
   core, and is thus one possible conservation method.}},

Pages = {{4280-4288}},
Abstract = {{Selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3 (NH3-SCR) at low
   temperature is a major challenge in environmental catalysis. In recent
   years, great efforts have been devoted to the development of
   low-temperature SCR catalysts for both stationary sources and diesel
   engines. Mn-based catalysts have attracted great attention due to their
   excellent low-temperature activity. However, vulnerability to SO2 and
   H2O poisoning and preference for N2O formation make these catalysts
   still far away from industrial application. V2O5 loaded on carbon
   materials has shown both high SCR activity and SO2 tolerance at
   low-temperature. This type of catalyst is very promising for
   applications in low-temperature SCR for stationary sources. Recently,
   Cu-containing small pore zeolites, such as Cu-SSZ-13 and Cu-SAPO-34 with
   a CHA structure and Cu-SSZ-39 and Cu-SAPO-18 with an AEI structure, were
   shown to have very high activity at low temperature and excellent
   hydrothermal stability at high temperature and thus received much
   attention for applications on diesel vehicles. In this review, we will
   focus on the recent studies on low-temperature NH3-SCR catalysts. In
   addition, the future directions of low-temperature SCR development will
   also be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A great portion of the world's oil reserves is contained in naturally
   fractured reservoirs (NFRs). As the conventional oil and gas reservoirs
   have become significantly depleted whereas energy demand sharply
   increases, the NFRs play an important role in oil exploration and make a
   large contribution toward oil and gas production worldwide. This paper
   aims to introduce a historical case study of a successful development
   plan for a giant fractured granite basement reservoir with a unique
   geological characterisation. A better geological understanding about the
   complexity of such a naturally fractured basement reservoir is provided
   within a simulation strategy in order to optimise successfully its oil
   exploitation. With our rich experiences in exploration and production of
   hydrocarbons in fractured basement granite rock for more than 20 years,
   it is a valuable case study for both current and future development
   planning of basement reservoirs elsewhere in the world.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of reversibility on the instability of a miscible vertical
   reactive flow displacement is examined. A model, where densities and/or
   viscosities mismatches between the reactants and the chemical product
   trigger instability, is adopted. The problem is governed by the
   continuity equation, Darcy's law, and the convection-diffusion-reaction
   equations. The problem is formulated and solved numerically using a
   combination of the highly accurate spectral methods based on Hartley's
   transform and the finite-difference technique. Nonlinear simulations
   were carried out for a variety of parameters to analyse the effects of
   the reversibility of the chemical reaction on the development of the
   flow under different scenarios of the frontal instability. In general,
   faster attenuation in the development and growth of the instability is
   reported as the reversibility of the chemical reaction increases.
   However, it was observed that reversibility is capable of triggering
   instability for particular choices of the densities and viscosities
   mismatches. In addition, the effect of the reversibility in enhancing
   the instability was illustrated by presenting the total relative contact
   area between the reactants and the product.}},

Abstract = {{It is frequently necessary in archaeology to map excavated features so
   their structure can be recorded before they are dismantled in order for
   the excavation to continue. This process can be time consuming, error
   prone and manually intensive. Three-dimensional recording devices, which
   have the advantage of being faster, less labor intensive and more
   detailed, present an attractive alternative method of mapping. A small,
   portable hand scanner such as the DotProduct DPI-7, could be used for
   this purpose. However, the three-dimensional data collected from this
   device contain systematic distortions that cause errors in the recorded
   shape of the features being mapped. The performance of the DPI-7 scanner
   is evaluated in this paper using self-calibration based techniques. A
   calibration field consisting of spherical targets rigidly mounted on a
   planar background was imaged from multiple locations, and the target
   deviations from expected locations are used to quantify the performance
   of the device. The largest source of systematic error in the DPI-7 data
   was found to be a scale error affecting dimensions orthogonal to the
   depth. These in-plane distortions were modeled using a single scale
   factor parameter in the self-calibration solution, resulting in a 54\%
   reduction in the RMS coordinate errors.}},

   imaging the top surface of a concrete beam subjected to fatigue loading
   in laboratory conditions. Whereas previous work has demonstrated the
   success of such sensors for measuring the response at point locations,
   the aim here is to measure the entire beam surface in support of the
   overall objective of evaluating the effectiveness of concrete beam
   reinforcement with steel fibre reinforced polymer sheets. After applying
   corrections for lens distortions to the data and differencing images
   over time to remove systematic errors due to internal scattering, the
   periodic deflections experienced by the beam have been estimated for the
   entire top surface of the beam and at witness plates attached. The
   results have been assessed by comparison with measurements from
   highly-accurate laser displacement transducers. This study concludes
   that both the Microsoft Kinect 2.0 and the Mesa Imaging SR4000s are
   capable of sensing a moving surface with sub-millimeter accuracy once
   the image distortions have been modeled and removed.}},

Abstract = {{Diabetic retinopathy is a condition of the eye of diabetic patients
   where the retina is damaged because of long-term diabetes. The condition
   deteriorates towards irreversible blindness in extreme cases of diabetic
   retinopathy. Hence, early detection of diabetic retinopathy is important
   to prevent blindness. Regular screening of fundus images of diabetic
   patients could be helpful in preventing blindness caused by diabetic
   retinopathy. In this paper, we propose techniques for staging of
   diabetic retinopathy in fundus images using several shape and texture
   features computed from detected microaneurysms, exudates, and
   hemorrhages. The classification accuracy is reported in terms of the
   area (A(z)) under the receiver operating characteristic curve using 200
   fundus images from the MESSIDOR database. The value of A(z) for
   classifying normal images versus mild, moderate, and severe
   nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) is 0.9106. The value of
   A(z) for classification of mild NPDR versus moderate and severe NPDR is
   0.8372. The A(z) value for classification of moderate NPDR and severe
   NPDR is 0.9750.}},

Pages = {{56590-56598}},
Abstract = {{Silver nanowires (AgNWs) were synthesized by AC electrodeposition of Ag
   into porous aluminum oxide templates. AgNWs were embedded into
   polystyrene via a solution processing technique to create a
   nanocomposite. For comparison, carbon nanotube (CNT)/polystyrene
   nanocomposites were identically generated. TEM and XRD analyses
   confirmed the synthesis of AgNWs with an average diameter and length of
   25 nm and 3.2 mm, respectively. TEM images also revealed that at the
   molding temperature (240 degrees C) AgNWs transformed into a chain of
   nanospheres. At low filler loadings, the AgNW/polystyrene nanocomposites
   presented inferior electrical properties compared to the CNT/polystyrene
   nanocomposites. This was attributed to a lower aspect ratio,
   fragmentation phenomenon and poorer conductive network for AgNWs.
   However, at high filler loadings, the electrical properties of the
   AgNW/polystyrene nanocomposites significantly increased. It seems that
   at high filler loadings, the conductive network was well-established for
   both types of nanocomposites and thus, the higher innate conductivity of
   AgNWs played a dominant role in presenting superior electrical
   properties.}},

Abstract = {{A novel PVC-incorporated membrane electrode selective for iron(III) is

   sensing molecule Cis, cis-1,3,5-tris\{(2-hydroxybenzyl) aminomethyl\}
   cyclohexane (THAC, L). The optimized membrane containing THAC, PVC and
   o-nitrophenyloctyl ether in the ratio 4:33:63 exhibits the best
   performance by means of range of concentration (1.0 x 10(-5) to 1.0 x
   10(-1) M), slope (19.4 mV/decade) and detection limit (7.0 x 10(-6) M).
   The sensor exhibited a firm response time (<15 s), extensive working pH
   range (3.0-6.5), non-aqueous steadiness (up to 20\%) and having
   sufficient long life time (120 days). The potentiometric selectivity
   coefficients obtained using match potential method (MPM) stipulates
   outstanding discrimination for Fe3+ ions among the various cations.
   Additionally, the sensor is found to be conveniently active like a
   potentiometric indicator electrode in the determination of Fe3+ ions

Abstract = {{We assess the overall performance of our quantum key distribution (QKD)
   system implementing the measurement-device-independent (MDI) protocol
   using components with varying capabilities such as different
   single-photon detectors and qubit preparation hardware. We
   experimentally show that superconducting nanowire single-photon
   detectors allow QKD over a channel featuring 60dB loss, and QKD with
   more than 600 bits of secret key per second (not considering finite key
   effects) over a 16dB loss channel. This corresponds to 300 and 80km of
   standard telecommunication fiber, respectively. We also demonstrate that
   the integration of our QKD system into FPGA-based hardware (instead of
   state-of-the-art arbitrary waveform generators) does not impact on its
   performance. Our investigation allows us to acquire an improved
   understanding of the trade-offs between complexity, cost and system
   performance, which is required for future customization of MDI-QKD.
   Given that our system can be operated outside the laboratory over
   deployed fiber, we conclude that MDI-QKD is a promising approach to
   information-theoretic secure key distribution.}},

Title = {{Compromise Rank Genetic Programming for Automated Nonlinear Design of
   Disaster Management}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel multiobjective evolutionary algorithm,
   called compromise rank genetic programming (CRGP), to realize a
   nonlinear system design (NSD) for disaster management automatically.
   This NSD issue is formulated here as a multiobjective optimization
   problem (MOP) that needs to optimize model performance and model
   structure simultaneously. CRGP combines decision making with the
   optimization process to get the final global solution in a single run.
   This algorithm adopts a new rank approach incorporating the subjective
   information to guide the search, which ranks individuals according to
   the compromise distance of their mapping vectors in the objective space.
   We prove here that the proposed approach can converge to the global
   optimum under certain constraints. To illustrate the practicality of
   CRGP, finally it is applied to a postearthquake reconstruction
   management problem. Experimental results show that CRGP is effective in
   exploring the unknown nonlinear systems among huge datasets, which is
   beneficial to assist the postearthquake renewal with high accuracy and
   efficiency. The proposed method is found to have a superior performance
   in obtaining a satisfied model structure compared to other related
   methods to address the disaster management problem.}},

Title = {{Calibration of Well Logs With Mini-Frac Data for Estimating the Minimum
   Horizontal Stress in the Tight-Gas Monteith Formation of the Western
   Canada Sedimentary Basin: A Case Study}},
Journal = {{SPE PRODUCTION \& OPERATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{110-120}},
Abstract = {{The determination of the minimum horizontal (in-situ) stress (MHS) is
   one of the most-important aspects in the characterization of
   geomechanical behavior of petroleum reservoirs because a good knowledge
   of such stress is critical in many activities of practical importance,
   including design of hydraulic-fracturing treatments and estimation of
   the distribution of MHS for reservoir-simulation purposes.
   The main objective of the study is to calibrate well logs with available
   mini-frac data for estimating the MHS in the tight-gas Monteith
   formation, Nikanassin Group of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin. For
   deep formations such as Monteith, the minimum stress is generally
   horizontal. Thus, the focus of this research is the MHS of the Monteith
   formation.
   First, actual values of the MHS at different well locations are acquired
   from the analysis of surface-pressure data during minifrac treatments.
   Next, the estimates calculated from an existing correlation and from
   actual mini-frac data are matched for calibration purposes. Finally,
   vertical and horizontal Biot's constant values are determined to
   generate a correlation applicable to the Monteith formation. Vertical
   Biot's constant ranging between 0.1 and 0.45 is obtained in this study,
   whereas horizontal Biot's constant is found to vary from 0.94 to 1.0.
   Three vertical wells located in the same township with available
   compressional and shear sonic logs and mini-frac data are selected for
   this work. The Monteith was hydraulically fractured in these wells in
   isolation. This aspect is important because there are many commingled
   completions in the area from which selective Monteith data are not
   available. Five additional wells in the same general area are selected
   to assist in the analysis.
   It is concluded that assuming vertical and horizontal Biot's constants
   equal to 1.0 is not appropriate for the Monteith formation in the study
   area. The procedure presented in this paper, which uses real data, is
   robust and has the potential to help in obtaining more-reliable
   geomechanical values in other tight formations around the world.}},

Abstract = {{We perform a sensor-based velocity field estimation in the wake of a
   wall-mounted pyramid from experimental data. The velocity field is
   measured with time-resolved stereoscopic PIV, and the sensors monitor
   local surface pressure. Starting point is the extended proper orthogonal
   decomposition technique. Key enablers for the spatio-temporal resolution
   of the strongly modulated shedding are (1) the exploitation of
   cross-correlation between velocity field and pressure, (2) time-delayed
   sensor signals, (3) symmetry considerations and (4) guaranteed
   orthonormality of the velocity expansion modes. The combined filtering
   operations are shown to yield a near-optimal flow estimation from
   pressure signals. The residual of the estimated coherent kinetic energy
   is about 30-50 \% smaller, and the mean-field paraboloid is better
   rendered than with the previously proposed estimation methods.}},

Title = {{An Improved Gyrocompass Alignment Method for Large Azimuth Misalignment}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Due to the impact of the nonlinear factor caused by large azimuth
   misalignment, the conventional gyrocompass alignment method is hard to
   favorably meet the requirement of alignment speed under the condition of
   large azimuth misalignment of INS. In order to solve this problem, an
   improved gyrocompass alignment method is presented in this paper. The
   improved method is designed based on the nonlinear model for large
   azimuth misalignment and performed by opening the azimuth loop. The
   influence of the nonlinear factor on gyrocompass alignment will be
   reduced when opening the azimuth loop. Simulation and experimental
   results show that the initial alignment can be efficiently accomplished
   through using the improved method in the case of existing large azimuth
   misalignment, and in the same conditions, the alignment speed of the
   improved method is faster than that of the conventional one.}},

Abstract = {{Electrokinetic micropumps have been widely used in lab-on-a-chip
   devices. The AC electrothermal (ACET) effect is highly efficient for
   biofluidic micropumping, but is unable to generate high flow rates.
   Attempts to increase ACET flows, such as applying a wide range of
   actuation voltages, using asymmetric microelectrode arrays and using 3D
   microelectrodes have been reported. In this paper a novel idea of
   employing circular coplanar asymmetric microelectrodes placed on the
   perimeter of a microchannel is explored. An array of microelectrodes is
   simulated using COMSOL Multiphysics software. The micropump output shows
   relatively high flow rates compared to other ACET micropumps which have
   the same electrode dimensions. Moreover, the idea of using different
   micropumps with scaled dimensions is investigated. The results show that
   a highly efficient ACET micropump can be achieved if an appropriate
   electrode size-to-channel dimension ratio is selected. The results also
   show that a micropump with a scale of 0.2 can show negligible flow rate,
   but if the electrodes are used in a micropump with the scale of 1, a
   flow rate of 15 x 10(6) mu m(3)/s can be generated. This new ACET pump
   design can be utilized for lab-on-a-chip applications, specifically in
   biofluid delivery systems.}},

Abstract = {{Electrokinetics have been widely used in lab-on-a-chip devices for fluid
   manipulation applications. The AC electrothermal (ACET) effect is a
   highly efficient technique for biofluids (sigma>0.1 S/m) active
   micromixing, which can be used in chemical, biological, and medical
   analysis systems. In this paper, a novel idea of employing
   microelectrode arrays placed on sidewalls of a fluidic microchannel for
   increasing the mixing efficiency of biofluids is numerically
   investigated. It was reported that coplanar asymmetric microelectrode
   arrays are capable of creating ACET vortices in the bulk of a high
   conductive electrolyte solution. Two electrode arrays can be placed on
   the sidewalls of a microchannel, each of which has a different role, one
   pumps the biofluid while the other mixes it. Two different actuation
   patterns were applied to the electrodes. One pair of microelectrodes was
   simulated and the simulation procedure was then verified by conducting
   experiments for ACET flow measurement in a similar geometry.
   Microelectrode arrays were fabricated on 1mm thick glass substrates
   using photolithography. A 800 mu m thick fluidic microchannel was
   fabricated by soft lithography of Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The
   results showed that such a technique can dramatically increase the
   mixing of the solution while pumping is taking place. The mechanism was
   capable of efficiently mixing biofluid solutions (resultant
   concentration ratio of up to 80\%) in a short time (<3 min) and short
   distance (<600 mu m) for a 300x300 mu m(2) fluidic microchannel cross
   section area. Medical analysis such as heterogeneous immunoassays can be
   potential applications of such micromixing technique.}},

Abstract = {{Microbubbles are widely used in many industries such as water treatment,
   drug coating, and ultrasonic contrast agents. Cross-flow focusing and
   co-flow focusing are considered basic mechanisms used for microbubble
   generation. Typically, to achieve micron-sized droplets requires
   structure dimensions in the same order of magnitude of the desired
   droplet sizes. In this paper we report a method of applying an external
   vibration to a cross-flow and co-flow focusing structure, which allows
   for smaller droplets to be generated. The junction dimension was 700x400
   mu m, and the channel width was 800 mu m. The two assumed fluids are
   selected in a way that the Capillary number is high (Ca>10) to make use
   of necking effect occurred in the downstream. Linear vibration was
   exerted on the microchannel structure in the direction of central flow.
   A 2D structure was simulated using finite element software, and the
   numerical approach was then verified by comparing the experimental data
   of a typical cross-flow focusing structure taken from our previous study
   with the corresponding simulation assuming the same parameters. The
   results show that although the droplet generation regime depends on flow
   ratio (Q(a)/Q(w)) and vibration parameter (amplxfreq), Capillary number
   also has a significant effect on the regime. Briefly, applying a
   low-cost linear vibration to the conventional flow focusing structures
   can be used as an accurate controlling technique for increasing the
   chance of droplet generation. In fact, vibration motion can change the
   flow regime and breakup mechanism. It can also change the breakup point
   at which the droplets are formed.}},

Abstract = {{Electrokinetics has many applications in a wide range of areas, such as
   lab-on-a-chip and biomedical microdevices. The electrothermal effect has
   been used for biofluid delivery systems since it has high pumping
   efficiency for high conductive liquids (> 0.1 S/m) compared to other
   electrokinetic techniques such as electroosmosis. AC electrothermal
   (ACET) micropumps are based on the temperature gradient caused by Joule
   heating or an external heat source, which generates permittivity and
   conductivity gradients in the bulk of the liquid. When the liquid is
   subjected to an electric field, the ACET force is created. Electrode
   geometry significantly affects the electric field distribution, which
   can yield stronger ACET forces. Previously electrode dimension
   optimization has been performed for a single-array coplanar asymmetric
   configuration in order to obtain maximum ACET velocities. In this paper
   we expand the study to other governing parameters in a multiple-row
   microelectrode array configuration consisting of microelectrodes placed
   on top, bottom, and/or side walls of a microchannel. The studied
   parameters are the substrate material and thickness, ambient
   temperature, fluid viscosity, and actuation frequency. Electrode
   dimensions remain constant during the study (120 mu m wide and 20 mu m
   thin electrodes, 20 mu m gap). The study is performed using finite
   element analysis software for one pair of microelectrodes on each array
   with periodic boundary conditions. The simulation data is then compared
   with experimental data for a single combination of the aforementioned
   parameters. The results show that the effect of these parameters on ACET
   flow can be significant.}},

Title = {{Mercaptan's Removal from Aqueous Solution using Modified Graphite-Based

Abstract = {{The removal of mercaptans (ethane thiol and 1-methyl, 1-propane thiol)
   from aqueous solution through adsorption using proprietary, partially
   porous, and electrically conducting graphite-based adsorbent (called
   Nyex 2000) was investigated. Nyex 2000 adsorbent was prepared through
   successive chemical, thermal, and physical treatments of Nyex 1000
   adsorbent (previously developed graphite intercalation compound
   {[}GIC]-based adsorbent material) with the aim of improved adsorption
   capacity. The characterization of Nyex 2000 was carried out including
   laser size analyzer, Boehm surface titration, X-ray (energy dispersive
   spectroscopy {[}EDS]) surface elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction
   (XRD) analysis, N-2 adsorption, and zeta potential measurements. The
   adsorption of both thiols on Nyex 2000 was found to be a rapid process
   (more than 80\% of equilibrium capacity achieved within 5 min). Nyex
   2000 showed an adsorption capacity of 6 and 9mg g(-1) for the removal of
   ethane thiol and 1-methyl, 1-propane thiol, respectively. After
   adsorption, Nyex 2000 was successfully electrochemically regenerated in
   a batch electrochemical cell. The regeneration efficiency was found to
   be consistent at around 100\% for five adsorption-regeneration cycles.
   The electrochemical parameters were as: treatment time of 40 min at a
   current density of 12 mA cm(-2) for a total charge passed of 240 C g(-1)
   at the average cell voltage of 3.5 V. The electrical energy of 120 J was
   found to be required for electrochemical oxidation of each mg of
   adsorbed mercaptan on the surface of Nyex 2000.}},

   terrain}},
Journal = {{CRYOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{587-601}},
Abstract = {{Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models are rarely verified for
   mountainous regions during the winter season, although avalanche
   forecasters and other decision makers frequently rely on NWP models.
   Winter precipitation from two NWP models (GEM-LAM and GEM15) and from a
   precipitation analysis system (CaPA) was verified at approximately 100
   stations in the mountains of western Canada and the north-western US.
   Ultrasonic snow depth sensors and snow pillows were used to observe
   daily precipitation amounts. For the first time, a detailed objective
   validation scheme was performed highlighting many aspects of forecast
   quality. Overall, the models underestimated precipitation amounts,
   although low precipitation categories were overestimated. The finer
   resolution model GEM-LAM performed best in all analysed aspects of model
   performance, while the precipitation analysis system performed worst. An
   analysis of the economic value of large precipitation categories showed
   that only mitigation measures with low cost-loss ratios (i.e. measures
   that can be performed often) will benefit from these NWP models. This
   means that measures with large associated costs relative to anticipated
   losses when the measure is not performed should not or not primarily
   depend on forecasted precipitation.}},

Abstract = {{A 2-D massively parallel, high throughput, systolic array for a
   spatio-temporal wave-digital filter (WDF) architecture is proposed. RF
   receive mode aperture beam personalities are achieved using 2-D fan
   filters with dynamically steerable passband directions and fan angles.
   The wave-digital realization results in low sensitivity of the far-field
   beam to errors in filter coefficients due to fixed-point effects in the
   digital arithmetic hardware. A fixed-point design of the systolic-array
   architecture that eliminates overflow errors is described. The
   architecture is implemented in FPGA-prototype form and tested using
   MATLAB Simulink with Xilinx EDA tools. The verified digital design is
   ported to CMOS standard-cell technology to obtain the area and power
   costs as well as the operational frequency. The 45 nm CMOS synthesis,
   placement, and routing show overflow free maximum frequency of operation
   of 131.02 MHz for 1-passband fan filter and an estimated power
   consumption of 450.30 mW at DC supply voltage 1.1 V indicating potential
   applications in the VHF range.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CANADIAN PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{26-35}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{During steam-based-oil-recovery processes (e.g., cyclic steam
   stimulation and steam-assisted gravity drainage), heat is transmitted
   from wellbore and reservoir to surrounding formations. The thermally
   induced deformation in shale can affect wellbore integrity and caprock
   integrity. In this paper, a compositional thermal strain model was
   proposed to quantify the thermally induced deformation in shallowly
   buried shale. The fabric of shale was examined and considered in the
   model. Thermally induced deformation in shale is contributed by the
   thermal deformation of shale-solid minerals, dehydration in clay, and
   thermal plastic strain (grain or particle rearrangement) in shale. Under
   drained heating, shale can contract or expand depending on its
   mineralogy, composition, structure, and the imposed temperature. The
   proposed thermal strain model was validated against the laboratory-test
   result of a shale sample retrieved from a heavy-oil field in the western
   Canada sedimentary basin.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POROUS MEDIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{179-188}},
Abstract = {{Liquid flow between porous and nonporous materials plays an important
   role in many science and engineering applications such as oil recovery
   from fractured porous media. The capillary continuity between porous
   matrix blocks via formation of liquid bridges is a key contributor to
   the gas-oil gravity drainage mechanism in a gas invaded zone of
   naturally fractured reservoirs, which increases the height of the
   continuous liquid column in a fractured formation, thereby enhancing the
   recovery of oil. However, the role of capillary forces in formation or
   break-up of liquid bridges between porous matrix blocks remains a
   controversial topic. In an attempt to improve an understanding of this
   problem, a force balance is presented for the concave liquid bridges
   formed between two horizontal parallel plates. The force balance allows
   development of a simple model that can be used to find a relationship
   between the net capillary force, contact angle, and liquid bridge
   volume. Three different regions including: (I) repulsive net capillary
   force, (II) attractive net capillary force, and (III) nonexistence
   regions have been identified. Region I is considered as a region of
   liquid bridge break-up while Region II is considered as a region of
   liquid bridge formation. The findings improve an understanding of the
   formation and break-up of the liquid bridges, which is important in oil
   recovery from naturally fractured reservoirs during a gravity drainage
   process. .}},

Abstract = {{The RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) planned to be launched in 2018
   is designed to support maritime surveillance requirements in which ice,
   wind, oil pollution, and ships are to be monitored by providing wide
   swath beam modes. In this article, we introduce the first analysis of
   ship detection performance using simulated RCM data. We report ship
   detection performance using a likelihood ratio test (LRT) for three wide
   swath RCM imaging modes: Ship Detection (25 m), Low Resolution (100 m),
   and Medium Resolution (50 m). These beam modes were assessed for a
   number of dual-polarimetric (dual-pol) systems, including the standard
   linear polarizations as well as compact polarimetry (CP). These data
   were simulated from RADARSAT-2 Fine Quad (FQ) mode in the three RCM
   modes. Furthermore, the detection performance of the pseudo-quad data
   reconstructed from the simulated circular transmit, linear receive data
   is also investigated and compared to the other systems' performance for
   the three RCM modes. The receiver operating characteristic curves are
   used in this study as the basic measure of detection performance for all
   beam modes and all detectors. We found that the compact polarimetric SAR
   detectors outperform the conventional linear dual-pol detectors at the
   three RCM modes for ship detection for medium to high incidence angles.
   At steep angles, the performance of the two polarization configurations
   was comparable. Our study confirmed that detection performance improved
   as incidence angle and spatial resolution increased. We also
   investigated the impact of the ship orientation with respect to the
   radar beam and found that detection performance was generally higher
   when ship was oriented perpendicular to the radar beam.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POROUS MEDIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{153-164}},
Abstract = {{The relative permeabilities at low saturation and high capillary
   pressure are important for any drainage process such as CO2 storage and
   steam-assisted gravity drainage. The relative permeabilities can be
   estimated by analyzing the wetting phase production histories at each
   step in a multistep drainage process. Different from the conventional
   porous plate method, the multistep drainage process applies a plastic
   membrane to significantly reduce experiment time while prevent the
   nonwetting phase from being discharged from the porous medium The
   conventional tubebundle model has some difficulties in modeling this
   process because in a drainagetype process the sealing effect of the
   membrane significantly changes the multiphase flow pattern. In this
   paper, an extended interactive tubebundle model (ITBM) was developed to
   model this process. First, in order to qualitatively model this process,
   a new threetube interacting capillary model was developed and the
   reverse flood and bidirectional flood were properly modeled. This model
   also explains in concept why, in this process, the phase with lower
   mobility determines the wetting phase production history. After that,
   the threetube interacting capillary model was extended to a complex
   ITBM, consisting of hundreds of tubes. The saturation profiles along the
   porous medium, the wetting phase production curves, and the multistep
   drainage process were all successfully modeled. The application of the
   ITBM indicates that it can better represent the pore structure of a
   porous medium and potentially be applied to history match a multistep
   drainage process.}},

Abstract = {{The AC electrothermal technique is very promising for biofluid
   micropumping, due to its ability to pump high conductivity fluids.
   However, compared to electroosmotic micropumps, a lack of high fluid
   flow is a disadvantage. In this paper, a novel AC multiple array
   electrothermal (MAET) micropump, utilizing multiple microelectrode
   arrays placed on the side-walls of the fluidic channel of the micropump,
   is introduced. Asymmetric coplanar microelectrodes are placed on all
   sides of the microfluidic channel, and are actuated in different phases:
   one, two opposing, two adjacent, three, or all sides at the same time.
   Micropumps with different combinations of side electrodes and cross
   sections are numerically investigated in this paper. The effect of the
   governing parameters with respect to thermal, fluidic, and electrical
   properties are studied and discussed. To verify the simulations, the AC
   MAET concept was then fabricated and experimentally tested. The resulted
   fluid flow achieved by the experiments showed good agreement with the
   corresponding simulations. The number of side electrode arrays and the
   actuation patterns were also found to greatly influence the micropump
   performance. This study shows that the new multiple array electrothermal
   micropump design can be used in a wide range of applications such as
   drug delivery and lab-on-a-chip, where high flow rate and high precision
   micropumping devices for high conductivity fluids are needed. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{To avoid the drawbacks of traditional fractal theory, such as
   complicated calculation and the difficulty in choosing the proper kind
   of fractal dimension, a wavelet fractal algorithm is proposed in this
   paper for the feature extraction of a hydro-turbine vibration signals.
   In this algorithm, wavelet functions are used to decompose the de-noised
   signal. After decomposition, variance of each level of the detailed
   components is introduced to describe the energy distribution on each
   level. The fractal dimension is the slope of the fitting line by taking
   scale j as the horizontal axis and variance as the vertical axis. To
   verify the theory introduced in this paper, a comparison of the wavelet
   fractal algorithm with the conventional fractal algorithm on a few sets
   of experimental vibration signals shows that although both methods are
   successful in feature extraction, the wavelet fractal algorithm provides
   more accurate feature extraction of hydro-turbine vibration signals.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid healing of dermatological wounds is of vital importance in
   preventing infection and reducing post-treatment side-effects. Here we
   report the therapeutic effects of phytochemically stabilized gold
   nanoparticles (pAuNPs) coated on a hydrocolloid membrane (HCM) for
   curing cutaneous wounds. Furthermore, the remedial effects of pAuNPs on
   skin regeneration and angiogenesis were examined using Sprague Dawley
   (R) (SD) rats with skin injuries after a pAuNP-deposited hydrocolloid
   membrane (pAuNP-HCM) had been applied for 15 days. The rate of wound
   closure was 4 times faster in the pAuNP-HCM-treated group than in the
   gauze (GZ)- or HCM-treated groups in the first 5 days. Moreover, wound
   widths in the pAuNP-HCM-treated group were significantly reduced after
   5-15 days of treatment following the injury, compared with the other
   groups. In addition, a significant increase in collagen expression and a
   decrease in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 expression and transforming
   growth factor (TGF-beta 1) concentration were observed in the
   pAuNP-HCM-treated group on day 5. Wound tissue applied with the
   pAuNP-HCM showed enhancement of vascular endothelial growth factor
   (VEGF), angiopoietin 1 (Ang-1), and angiopoietin 2 (Ang-2) expression.
   Furthermore, the activity of superoxide dismutases (SODs) was
   significantly increased in the skin tissue of the pAuNP-HCM-treated
   group, compared with the GZ- or HCM-treated groups. It is probable that
   the accelerated process of wound healing in the injured skin of SD rats
   via pAuNP-HCM results from the synergistic regulation of angiogenesis
   and connective tissue formation, as well as the stimulation of
   antioxidant effects.}},

Abstract = {{The intrinsic kinetics of the carbonation reactions for two limestones
   (Havelock and Cadomin) were studied using an atmospheric
   thermogravimetric analyzer (ATGA) and a pressurized thermogravimetric
   analyzer (PTGA). A grain model was applied to measure the kinetic
   parameters. The order of the carbonation reaction was related to the
   carbon dioxide (CO2) partial pressure, changing from the first order to
   the zero order when the CO2 partial pressure exceeded similar to 0.7 atm
   for both limestones. The rate of carbonation reaction increased with
   increasing temperature up to 675 degrees C and decreased with further
   increases. No significant effect of particle size was found on the rate
   of carbonation reaction. Thermodynamic and kinetic simulations of the
   carbonation reaction using the Aspen Plus simulator was performed,
   obtaining the optimal temperature of 650 degrees C. The activation
   energies were 32.1 and 20.3 kJ/mol for the tested Havelock and Cadomin
   limestones, respectively. The simulation results from the kinetic model
   were in good agreement with the experimental data, showing the
   reversible characteristic of the carbonation reaction. The shift in the
   mechanism of the carbonation reaction with temperature and the shift in
   the reaction order with CO2 partial pressure were demonstrated by both
   the experiments and simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Rice is one of the staple foods for more than three billion people
   worldwide. Rice paddies accounted for approximately 11.5\% of the
   World's arable land area during 2012. Rice provided similar to 19\% of
   the global dietary energy in recent times and its annual average
   consumption per capita was similar to 65 kg during 2010-2011. Therefore,
   rice area mapping and forecasting its production is important for food
   security, where demands often exceed production due to an ever
   increasing population. Timely and accurate estimation of rice areas and
   forecasting its production can provide invaluable information for
   governments, planners, and decision makers in formulating policies in
   regard to import/export in the event of shortfall and/or surplus. The
   aim of this paper was to review the applicability of the remote
   sensing-based imagery for rice area mapping and forecasting its
   production. Recent advances on the resolutions (i.e., spectral, spatial,
   radiometric, and temporal) and availability of remote sensing imagery
   have allowed us timely collection of information on the growth and
   development stages of the rice crop. For elaborative understanding of
   the application of remote sensing sensors, following issues were
   described: the rice area mapping and forecasting its production using
   optical and microwave imagery, synergy between remote sensing-based
   methods and other developments, and their implications as an operational
   one. The overview of the studies to date indicated that remote
   sensing-based methods using optical and microwave imagery found to be
   encouraging. However, there were having some limitations, such as: (i)
   optical remote sensing imagery had relatively low spatial resolution led
   to inaccurate estimation of rice areas; and (ii) radar imagery would
   suffer from speckles, which potentially would degrade the quality of the
   images; and also the brightness of the backscatters were sensitive to
   the interacting surface. In addition, most of the methods used in
   forecasting rice yield were empirical in nature, so thus it would
   require further calibration and validation prior to implement over other
   geographical locations.}},

Abstract = {{Prior information about the average dielectric properties of breast
   tissue can be implemented in microwave breast imaging techniques to
   improve the results. Rapidly providing this information relies on
   acquiring a limited number of measurements and processing these
   measurement with efficient algorithms. Previously, systems were
   developed to measure the transmission of microwave signals through
   breast tissue, and simplifications were applied to estimate the average
   properties. These methods provided reasonable estimates, but they were
   sensitive to multipath. In this paper, a new technique to analyze the
   average properties of breast tissues while addressing multipath is
   presented. Three steps are used to process transmission measurements.
   First, the effects of multipath were removed. In cases where multipath
   is present, multiple peaks were observed in the time domain. A Tukey
   window was used to time-gate a single peak and, therefore, select a
   single path through the breast. Second, the antenna response was
   deconvolved from the transmission coefficient to isolate the response
   from the tissue in the breast interior. The antenna response was
   determined through simulations. Finally, the complex permittivity was
   estimated using an iterative approach. This technique was validated
   using simulated and physical homogeneous breast models and tested with
   results taken from a recent patient study.}},

Abstract = {{Existing self-calibration methods for terrestrial laser scanners are
   predominantly point-based and plane-based. In this paper, we present a
   new cylinder-based self-calibration method with its variants for several
   scanners having different architectures and scanning mechanisms. The
   method not only increases the flexibility of in situ self-calibration,
   but also its rigor because of reduced functional dependencies between
   adjustment parameters. Based on the analysis of linear dependencies
   between columns of the design matrices for both the cylindrical and
   planar models, it is shown that using the vertical cylindrical model is
   advantageous over using the planar model as some high linear
   dependencies can be avoided. The proposed method and its variants were
   first applied to two simulated datasets, to compare their effectiveness,
   and then to three real datasets captured by three different types of
   scanners are presented: a Faro Focus 3D (a phase-based panoramic
   scanner); a Velodyne HDL-32E (a pulse-based multi spinning beam
   scanner); and a Leica ScanStation C10 (a dual operating-mode scanner).
   The experimental results show that the proposed method can properly
   estimate the additional parameters with high precision. More
   importantly, no high correlations were found between the additional
   parameters and other parameters when the network configuration is
   strong. The overall results indicate that the proposed calibration
   method is rigorous and flexible. (C) 2014 International Society for

Abstract = {{We present an automatic mutual information (MI) registration method for
   mobile LiDAR and panoramas collected from a driving vehicle. The
   suitability of MI for registration of aerial LiDAR and aerial oblique
   images has been demonstrated under an assumption that minimization of
   joint entropy (JE) is a sufficient approximation of maximization of MI.
   We show that this assumption is invalid for the ground-level data. The
   entropy of a LiDAR image cannot be regarded as approximately constant
   for small perturbations. Instead of minimizing the JE, we directly
   maximize MI to estimate corrections of camera poses. Our method
   automatically registers mobile LiDAR with spherical panoramas over an
   approximate 4-km drive, and is the first example we are aware of that
   tests MI registration in a large-scale context. (C) The Authors.

Abstract = {{Quantitative, reverse transcription, polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)
   is facilitated by leveraging droplet microfluidic (DMF) system, which
   due to its precision dispensing and sample handling capabilities at
   microliter and lower volumes has emerged as a popular method for
   miniaturization of the PCR platform. This work substantially improves
   and extends the functional capabilities of our previously demonstrated
   single qRT-PCR micro-chip, which utilized a combination of electrostatic
   and electrowetting droplet actuation. In the reported work we illustrate
   a spatially multiplexed micro-device that is capable of conducting up to
   eight parallel, real-time PCR reactions per usage, with adjustable
   control on the PCR thermal cycling parameters (both process time and
   temperature set-points). This micro-device has been utilized to detect
   and quantify the presence of two clinically relevant respiratory
   viruses, Influenza A and Influenza B, in human samples (nasopharyngeal
   swabs, throat swabs). The device performed accurate detection and
   quantification of the two respiratory viruses, over several orders of
   RNA copy counts, in unknown (blind) panels of extracted patient samples
   with acceptably high PCR efficiency (>94\%). The multi-stage qRT-PCR
   assays on eight panel patient samples were accomplished within 35-40
   min, with a detection limit for the target Influenza virus RNAs
   estimated to be less than 10 RNA copies per reaction.}},

Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{99-115}},

Abstract = {{River flow forecasting is critical for flood forecasting, reservoir
   operations, and water resources management. However, flow forecasting
   can be difficult, challenging and time consuming due to the spatial and
   temporal variability of climatic conditions and watershed
   characteristics. From a practical point of view, a simple and intuitive
   approach might be more preferable than a complex modeling approach. In
   this study, our objective was to develop short-term (i.e., daily) flow
   forecasting models in the Bow River at the city of Calgary, Alberta,
   Canada. Here, we evaluated the performance of several regression models,
   along with a newly proposed ``base difference{''} model, by using
   antecedent daily river flow values from three gauge stations (i.e.,
   Banff, Seebe, and Calgary). Our analyses revealed that using a
   multivariable linear regression formulated as a function of upstream
   gauge stations (i.e., Banff or Seebe) and the station of interest (i.e.,
   Calgary) using antecedent flows demonstrated strong relationships (i.e.,
   having r(2) (coefficient of determination) and RMSE (root-mean-square
   deviation) of approximately 0.93 and 14 m(3)/s, respectively). As such,
   we opted to suggest that the use of Banff and Calgary stations in
   forecasting the flows at Calgary could be considered as it would require
   a relatively lower number of gauge stations.}},

Title = {{A new model to estimate CO2 coal gasification kinetics based only on
   parent coal characterization properties}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Pages = {{126-133}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{A new mathematical model is proposed for the estimation of CO2
   gasification kinetics of different rank coals and ash contents. There
   are no previous reports on the determination of the conversion rate or
   even residence time of CO2 or steam gasification based on coal
   characterization and for a wide range of ash content. This new approach
   can be used to infer the residence time and other parameters required
   for reactor design and operation optimization of newly mined coals or
   coal mixtures used as feedstock.
   The coal micropore surface area and the alkaline content determined by
   the ash composition were proved to be the most significant variables
   influencing the gasification rate. These variables were correlated to
   formulate a semi-empirical expression based on the Arrhenius equation.
   An equation to infer residence time, independent of the kinetic model,
   is also presented.
   The new equation is important in understanding the catalytic effect of
   the alkaline content in the temperature range where the chemical
   reaction is the controlling step. It can also be used as the
   corresponding term of the chemical reaction in a gas-solid kinetic model
   when working at higher temperatures. This new approach is valid, if
   there is not loss of alkali and alkaline earth metals due to sublimation
   or melting, which results in a glassy slag structure. The proposed model
   has direct industrial application in simulation of gasifiers'
   performance with the knowledge of only coal characterization properties.

   areas which educational institutions should consider in developing and
   preparing future project managers: 1) developing critical thinking for
   dealing with complexity, 2) developing softer parameters of managing
   projects, especially interpersonal skills and leadership as opposed to
   just technical skills, and 3) preparing project managers to be engaged
   within the context of real life projects. The authors argue that the

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{11-17}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Meniscal injury has been well documented as a frequent
   consequence of both acute and chronic ACL deficiency. The purpose of
   this study was to evaluate the effect of ACL deficiency on meniscal
   loads in vivo and determine how these loads would change over time after
   ACL injury.
   Methods: The in vivo kinematics of the stifle joint of five sheep were
   measured during normal gait, as well as 4 and 20 weeks after ACL
   transection. A unique robotic testing platform was then programmed to
   reproduce all the previously recorded kinematics and the loads carried
   by medial and lateral menisci during gait were estimated.
   Results: The results demonstrated a significant increase in both medial
   and lateral meniscal loads 20 weeks following ACL transection, mainly
   during mid-stance phase of gait (p = 0.007 and p = 0.003, respectively),
   with interesting inter-subject variability. A moderate correlation (R-2
   >= 0.5) between in situ meniscal loads and anterior tibial translations
   was also detected over time after injury, increased translations post
   injury generally corresponded to larger meniscal loads.
   Conclusion: The dramatic increase in meniscal loads long term post ACL
   transection probably explains the meniscal changes or injuries reported
   clinically in many chronic ACL-deficient knees. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

   microsimulation tool was used to simulate the operation of these systems
   to replicate more closely the on-demand nature of PRT and to get better
   estimates of the operating speed, reliability, and passengers waiting,
   boarding and alighting times for both types of examined systems. The
   project efficiency was analyzed given the calculated economic cash flow
   for a certain period (e.g., 30 years). The results indicate that the
   three examined systems differed widely in terms of their capital cost,
   maintenance and operating cost, capacity, and their anticipated
   benefits.}},

Abstract = {{Granular materials involve microphysics across the various scales giving
   rise to distinct behaviours of geomaterials, such as steady states,
   plastic limit states, non-associativity of plastic and yield flow, as
   well as instability of homogeneous deformations through strain
   localization. Incorporating such micro-scale characteristics is one of
   the biggest challenges in the constitutive modelling of granular
   materials, especially when micro-variables may be interdependent. With
   this motivation, we use two micro-variables such as coordination number
   and fabric anisotropy computed from tessellation of the granular
   material to describe its state at the macroscopic level. In order to
   capture functional dependencies between micro-variables, the correlation
   between coordination number and fabric anisotropy limits is herein
   formulated at the particle level rather than on an average sense. This
   is the essence of the proposed work which investigates the evolutions of
   coordination number distribution (connectivity) and anisotropy (contact
   normal) distribution curves with deformation history and their
   inter-dependencies through discrete element modelling in two dimensions.
   These results enter as probability distribution functions into
   homogenization expressions during upscaling to a continuum constitutive
   model using tessellation as an abstract representation of the granular
   system. The end product is a micro-mechanically inspired continuum model
   with both coordination number and fabric anisotropy as underlying
   micro-variables incorporated into a plasticity flow rule. The derived
   plastic potential bears striking resemblance to cam-clay or
   stress-dilatancy-type yield surfaces used in soil mechanics.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the effect of pore geometry on the viscous
   instability in surfactant-polymer flooding in an initially preferential
   water-wet porous medium filled with heavy oil and brine. Two approaches
   are used to characterize the effect of viscous instability. In both
   approaches, the dynamic mean pore-scale capillary number N-c1 is
   considered as the foremost criterion to characterize the effect of
   viscous instability. In the first approach, which is a pore network
   approach, the effect of viscous instability on N-c1 is neglected. In the
   second approach, the viscous instability effect is included by using the
   viscous instability theory to determine N-c1. The comparison between
   N-c1 from the port network approach and viscous instability theory is
   used to show the effect of viscous instability. The change in N-c1 was
   found to be an appropriate tool to characterize the effect of viscous
   instability in surfactant-polymer flooding.}},

Abstract = {{In many oil recovery processes, the aim is to recover the residual oil
   from the reservoir by increasing the capillary number via either
   decreasing the interfacial tension and/or increasing the displacing
   fluid viscosity. Hence, it is of particular importance to identify the
   form of the relative permeability curves at high-capillary-number flow.
   Despite the tremendous amount of studies published on the form of
   two-phase relative permeability curves at low-and ultra-low IFT (i.e.,
   at high-capillary-number flow), a detailed review of these works is
   missing from the literature. Thus, this extensive review has been
   conducted with the hope to bridge the gap in information. The topics
   covered in this survey include the description of the relative
   permeability, factors affecting the relative permeability, relative
   permeability at high-capillary-number flow, and the IFT effect on the
   relative permeability of oil-water, gas-water, gas-oil, and

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Phosphorus (P) recovery from sewage sludge is necessary for a
   sustainable development of the environment and thus the society due to
   gradual depletion of non-renewable P resources. Aerobic granular sludge
   is a promising biotechnology for wastewater treatment, which could
   achieve P-rich granules during simultaneous nitrification and
   denitriftation processes. This study aimed to disclose the changes in
   inorganic and organic P species and their correlation with P mobility
   and bio-availability in aerobic granules. Two identical square reactors
   were used to cultivate aerobic granules, which were operated for 120
   days with influent ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N) of 100 mg/L before day 60
   and then increased to 200 mg/L during the subsequent 60 days (chemical
   oxygen demand (COD) was kept constant at 600 mg/L). The aerobic granules
   exhibited excellent COD removal and nitrification efficiency. Results
   showed that inorganic P (IP) was about 61.4-67.7\% of total P (TP) and
   non-apatite inorganic P (NAIP) occupied 61.9-70.2\% of IP in the
   granules. The enrichment amount of NAIP and apatite P (AP) in the
   granules had strongly positive relationship with the contents of metal
   ions, i.e. Fe and Ca, respectively accumulated in the granules. X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) analysis and solution index calculation demonstrated
   that hydroxyapatite (Ca-5(PO4)(3)(OH)) and iron phosphate (Fe-7(PO4)(6))
   were the major P minerals in the granules. Organic P (OP) content
   maintained around 7.5 mg per gram of biomass in the aerobic granules
   during the 120 days' operation. Monoester phosphate (21.8\% of TP in
   extract), diester phosphate (1.8\%) and phosphonate (0.1\%) were
   identified as OP species by Phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance
   (P-31 NMR). The proportion of NAIP + OP to TP was about 80\% in the
   granules, implying high potentially mobile and bio-available P was
   stored in the nitrifying aerobic granules. The present results provide a
   new insight into the characteristics of P species in aerobic granules,
   which could be helpful for developing P removal and recovery techniques
   through biological wastewater treatment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Detection of the nipple in mammograms is an important step in algorithms
   for the detection of breast cancer. However, locating the nipple
   position is a challenging task due to distortion and displacement of the
   nipple by breast diseases, improper imaging techniques, and variation of
   the characteristics of breast tissues with different imaging protocols
   or modalities. This paper presents a novel approach for the detection of
   the nipple in mammograms based on the converging characteristics of
   oriented patterns of the breast tissues towards the nipple. The oriented
   structures are extracted with a bank of real Gabor filters and are
   transformed into the Radon domain to analyze linear structures of tissue
   patterns to determine the nipple position. The performance of the method
   was evaluated with different types of images, such as scanned
   screen-film (from the mini-MIAS and DDSM databases), digital
   radiography, and computed radiography, and average errors of 7.71 mm,
   7.52 mm, 9.23 mm, and 12.10 mm were achieved, respectively, with
   reference to the nipple location marked by an expert radiologist. The
   proposed method outperforms two recently developed approaches for the
   same application. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Cost, benefits and quality of software development documentation: A
   systematic mapping}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{99}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Context: Software documentation is an integral part of any software
   development process. Researchers and practitioners have expressed
   concerns about costs, benefits and quality of software documentation in
   practice. On the one hand, there is a lack of a comprehensive model to
   evaluate the quality of documentation. On the other hand, researchers
   and practitioners need to assess whether documentation cost outweighs
   its benefit.
   Objectives: In this study, we aim to summarize the existing literature
   and provide an overview of the field of software documentation cost,
   benefit and quality.
   Method: We use the systematic-mapping methodology to map the existing
   body of knowledge related to software documentation cost, benefit and
   quality. To achieve our objectives, 11 Research Questions (RQ) are
   raised. The primary papers are carefully selected. After applying the
   inclusion and exclusion criteria, our study pool included a set of 69
   papers from 1971 to 2011. A systematic map is developed and refined
   iteratively.
   Results: We present the results of a systematic mapping covering
   different research aspects related to software documentation cost,
   benefit and quality (RQ1-11). Key findings include: (1) validation
   research papers are dominating (27 papers), followed by solution
   proposals (21 papers). (2) Most papers (61 out of 69) do not mention the
   development life-cycle model explicitly. Agile development is only
   mentioned in 6 papers. (3) Most papers include only one ``System under
   Study{''} (SUS) which is mostly academic prototype. The average number
   of participants in survey-based papers is 106, the highest one having
   approximately 1000 participants. (4) In terms of focus of papers, 50
   papers focused on documentation quality, followed by 37 papers on
   benefit, and 12 papers on documentation cost. (5) The quality attributes
   of documentation that appear in most papers are, in order: completeness,
   consistency and accessibility. Additionally, improved meta-models for
   documentation cost, benefit and quality are also presented. Furthermore,
   we have created an online paper repository of the primary papers
   analyzed and mapped during this study.
   Conclusion: Our study results show that this research area is emerging
   but far from mature. Firstly, documentation cost aspect seems to have
   been neglected in the existing literature and there are no systematic
   methods or models to measure cost. Also, despite a substantial number of
   solutions proposed during the last 40 years, more and stronger empirical
   evidences are still needed to enhance our understanding of this area. In
   particular, what we expect includes (1) more validation or evaluation
   studies; (2) studies involving large-scale development projects, or from
   large number of study participants of various organizations; (3) more
   industry-academia collaborations; (4) more estimation models or methods
   to assess documentation quality, benefit and, especially, cost. (C) 2014

   for both CuNW/PP composite and CNT/PP composite. The plateaus are
   located at a different concentration range for each composite type: for
   CuNW/PP composite, it is between 0.8 and 1.7 vol \%, while for CNT/PP
   composite the plateau occurs in a narrower range between 0.4 and 0.6 vol
   \%. The shielding effectiveness (SE) increases with increased
   concentration of fillers. CNT/PP composite has higher SE at
   concentrations less than 2 vol \%; the two curves cross near 10 dB at
   this point and at concentrations higher than 2 vol \%, CuNW/PP composite

Abstract = {{This study examines the effects of non-wetting phase trapping in
   viscous-modified low-interfacial tension flow during viscous surfactant
   waterflooding (or surfactant-polymer flooding) under three different
   injection flowrates in three initially preferential water-wet porous
   media (each with a different pore throat size) partially filled with
   heavy oil and brine. In two approaches developed in this study, dynamic
   mean pore-scale capillary number N-c1 is considered as the foremost
   criterion to characterize the effect of non-wetting phase trapping. In
   the first approach, which is a pore network approach, the effect of
   phase trapping on the value of N-c1 is neglected. In the second
   approach, which is a numerical method, the effect of phase trapping is
   included. By comparing the values of N-c1 from the pore network approach
   and numerical method, the effect of phase trapping is characterized. The
   change in N-c1 was found to be an appropriate tool to characterize the
   effects of phase trapping in viscous surfactant waterflooding.}},

Abstract = {{The fast-growing technology of large scale wind turbines demands control
   systems capable of enhancing both the efficiency of capturing wind
   power, and the useful life of the turbines themselves. l(1)-Optimal
   control is an approach to deal with persistent exogenous disturbances
   which have bounded magnitude (l(infinity)-norm) such as realistic wind
   disturbances and turbulence profiles. In this brief, we develop an
   efficient method to compute the l(1)-norm of a system. As the control
   synthesis problem is nonconvex, we use the proposed method to design the
   optimal output feedback controllers for a linear model of a wind turbine
   at different operating points using genetic algorithm optimization. The
   locally optimized controllers are interpolated using a gain-scheduled
   technique with guaranteed stability. The controller is tested with
   comprehensive simulation studies on a 5 MW wind turbine using fatigue,
   aerodynamics, structures, and turbulence (FAST) software. The proposed
   controller is compared with a well-tuned proportional-integral (PI)
   controller. The results show improved power quality, and decrease in the
   fluctuations of generator torque and rotor speed.}},

Abstract = {{Demand response plays an important role in the development of the smart
   grid, which can effectively manage society's energy consumption. Cooling
   devices, such as refrigerators and freezers, are ideal devices for
   demand-response programs because their energy states can be controlled
   without reducing the lifestyle and comfort of the residents. Conversely,
   managing air conditioning and space heating would affect a resident's
   comfort level. Direct compressor control and thermostat control methods
   have been proposed in the past for controlling cooling devices but they
   are never studied concurrently. This paper proposes a new control
   mechanism and compares the effectiveness of the three control mechanisms
   for cooling devices in demand response. In addition, this paper
   illustrates the need for a damping strategy to mitigate demand
   oscillations that occur from synchronous fleet control.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Study the impact of intra-articular interleukin-1 receptor
   antagonist (IL-1 ra) treatment on lubricin biosynthesis following
   anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) in the rat and evaluate
   the effect of combined IL-1 ra and recombinant human lubricin (rhPRG4)
   treatments on chondrocyte apoptosis.
   Methods: ACLT was performed in male Lewis rats. Treatments included IL-1
   ra or vehicle (n = 36 in each group). IL-1 ra intra-articular dosing was
   performed on days 1, 3, 5 and 7 following ACLT using Anakinra (150
   mg/ml; 40 mu l). At 3 and 5 weeks, animals were sacrificed and RNA was
   isolated. Histological analyses included Safranin O and H\&E. Lubricin
   synovial fluid (SF) lavage concentrations were determined at 5 weeks.
   ACLT animals were treated with a single injection of vehicle, IL-1 ra
   (75 mg/ml; 40 mu l), rhPRG4 (200 mu g/ml; 40 mu l), or IL-1 ra + rhPRG4
   (75 mu g/ml + 200 mu g/ml; 40 mu l) (n = 6 in each group) on day 7
   following ACLT and cartilage was probed for cleaved caspase-3 at 5
   weeks.
   Results: IL-1 ra treatment improved lubricin expression (P < 0.001) and
   lubricin SF lavage concentrations in the IL-1 ra group was higher (P =
   0.005) than the vehicle. IL-1 ra treatment reduced cartilage and
   synovial scores (P < 0.001) compared to vehicle. IL-1 ra and rhPRG4
   acted synergistically to reduce caspase-3 positive chondrocytes (P <
   0.001) compared to individual treatments.
   Conclusion: IL-1 ra treatment preserved lubricin following ACLT and a
   combined treatment of IL-1 ra + rhPRG4 may act synergistically to reduce
   cartilage catabolism. (C) 2014 Osteoarthritis Research Society

Abstract = {{With the integration of wind farms into electric power grids, an
   accurate wind power prediction is becoming increasingly important for
   the operation of these power plants. In this paper, a new forecasting
   engine for wind power prediction is proposed. The proposed engine has
   the structure of Wavelet Neural Network (WNN) with the activation
   functions of the hidden neurons constructed based on multi-dimensional
   Morlet wavelets. This forecast engine is trained by a new improved
   Clonal selection algorithm, which optimizes the free parameters of the
   WNN for wind power prediction. Furthermore, Maximum Correntropy
   Criterion (MCC) has been utilized instead of Mean Squared Error as the
   error measure in training phase of the forecasting model. The proposed
   wind power forecaster is tested with real-world hourly data of system
   level wind power generation in Alberta, Canada. In order to demonstrate
   the efficiency of the proposed method, it is compared with several other
   wind power forecast techniques. The obtained results confirm the
   validity of the developed approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This study investigates the dielectric properties of multiwalled carbon
   nanotube (MWCNT)/polystyrene (PS) composites over the broadband
   frequency range, i.e., 10(-1) to 10(6) Hz. The results showed that the
   real permittivity and imaginary permittivity increased remarkably with
   increased MWCNT concentration. For instance, at 100 Hz, the real
   permittivity and imaginary permittivity of the pristine PS was 2.71 and
   0.01, respectively, which increased to 5.22 x 10(4) and 3.28 x 10(7) at
   3.50 wt\%, respectively. The increase in the real permittivity was
   related to the formation of a large number of nanocapacitor structures,
   i.e., MWCNTs as nanoelectrodes and polymer matrix as dielectric
   material, i.e., interfacial polarization. The increase in the imaginary
   permittivity with MWCNT loading was attributed greater number of
   dissipating charges, enhanced conductive network formation, and boosted
   polarization loss arising from interfacial polarization. It was also
   observed that the real and imaginary permittivities were frequency
   independent in the insulative region, whereas they decreased drastically
   with frequency in the conductive region. The descending trend of real
   permittivity with frequency in the conductive region was related to
   charge polarization relaxation, whereas the reduction in imaginary
   permittivity with frequency was attributed to lower Ohmic loss and
   polarization loss. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 55:173-179, 2015. (c) 2014 Society

Abstract = {{Synthetic CaO sorbents were prepared using alumina as a sintering
   inhibitor via a simple precipitation method. The effects of three mixing
   procedures on the physical properties and CO2 capture performance of the
   sorbents were examined. The cyclic CO2 capture performance of the
   sorbent derived from the precipitation of calcium salts over colloidal
   alumina (highly dispersed alumina gel) showed the best performance of
   the three mixing methods. It was found that variation of alumina-to-CaO
   ratios did not significantly change the sintering influence on the
   sorbent capacity in cyclic operations. CaO particles homogeneously
   mingled with alumina at higher ratios. Sintering prevention, however,
   was not observed. This important observation indicates that alumina
   appeared to merely act as a binder for the fabrication of mechanically
   enhanced strength particles that are suitable for large-scale
   operations. It was determined that CO2 uptake was not dependent on
   either the mixing technique or the type of synthetic materials
   incorporated into a sorbent in cyclic operation. The sorbent derived
   from the precipitation of calcium salts over colloidal alumina with an
   alumina-to-CaO ratio of 20:80 achieved the highest CO2 uptake of
   13.1moles/kg sorbent for half an hour of carbonation in the first cycle
   and retained a sorption capacity of 6.5moles/kg sorbent after 17
   successive cycles (50\% activity loss), which is in agreement with the
   reported results. It was demonstrated that the quantity of CO2 uptake
   increased moderately with decreasing sorbent particle sizes. The effect
   of pressure on sorbent CO2 uptake was insignificant.}},

Abstract = {{Context: Software documentation is an integral part of any software
   development process. However, software practitioners are often concerned
   about the value, degree of usage and usefulness of documentation during
   development and maintenance.
   Objective: Motivated by the needs of NovAtel Inc. (NovAtel), a
   world-leading company developing software systems in support of global
   navigation satellite systems, and based on the results of a former
   systematic mapping study, we aimed at better understanding of the usage
   and the usefulness of various technical documents during software
   development and maintenance.
   Method: We utilized the results of a former systematic mapping study and
   performed an industrial case study at NovAtel. From the joint definition
   of the analysis goals, the research method incorporates qualitative and
   quantitative analysis of 55 documents (design, test and process related)
   and 1630 of their revisions. In addition, we conducted a survey on the
   usage and usefulness of documents. A total of 25 staff members from the
   industrial partner, all having a medium to high level of experience,
   participated in the survey.
   Results: In the context of the case study, a number of findings were
   derived. They include that (1) technical documentation was consulted
   least frequently for maintenance purpose and most frequently as an
   information source for development, (2) source code was considered most
   frequently as the preferred information source during software
   maintenance, (3) there is no significant difference between the usage of
   various documentation types during both development and maintenance, and
   (4) initial hypotheses stating that up-to-date information, accuracy and
   preciseness have the highest impact on usefulness of technical
   documentation.
   Conclusions: It is concluded that the usage of documentation differs for
   various purposes and it depends on the type of the information needs as
   well as the tasks to be completed (e.g., development and maintenance).
   The results have been confirmed to be helpful for the company under
   study, and the firm is currently implementing some of the
   recommendations given. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a miniaturized discrete system for long-term
   biphasic deep brain stimulation (DBS) with independently programmable
   anodic and cathodic currents and pulse widths, frequency, pulse order
   and interpulse interval. It features a single current source and an
   H-bridge for setting current direction. The single source allows good
   charge balance, limiting DC current to under 50 nA which is further
   reduced to below 1 nA by electrode shorting. Voltage compliance is
   limited to 12 V. The device along with battery power supply weighs 2.3
   g. The system is highly customizable, permitting tradeoff between
   voltage compliance and the range, resolution and accuracy of currents
   and between power consumption and temporal resolution with minimal
   hardware modification. Based on average current consumption and nominal
   battery capacity, the stimulator can provide 300 mu A, 130 Hz, 100 mu s
   symmetric biphasic stimulation with an 11.5 V compliance for 14 days.
   Design details, characterization measurements and experimental data
   comparing the stimulator to a benchtop device in an anesthetized rat are
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a sensitive and selective sensor for hydrocarbon/water
   vapor mixtures using nanomechanical infrared (IR) spectroscopy with a
   porous silicon (P-Si) microcantilever. Facile and direct anodization
   process is utilized to fabricate vertically aligned nanopores of 20-50
   nm diameters on a plain silicon microcantilever. The effective Young's
   modulus and surface area of a P-Si microcantilever can be easily
   controlled by the thickness of the anodized P-Si layer. Here we
   demonstrate the detection of 1 wt\% naphtha/water vapor mixtures using
   nanoporous cantilever IR spectroscopy. Nanoporous nature of the
   cantilever surface enhances its thermomechanical sensitivity. In
   addition, trapping the volatile hydrocarbon molecules in the nanowells
   increases the analyte concentration on the surface. Nanomechanical IR
   spectra of adsorbed vapors were obtained by plotting the deflection
   amplitudes of the microcantilever as a function of the illuminating IR
   wavenumber. The mass of the adsorbed vapors was determined from
   variations in the resonance frequency of the cantilever. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Metal-nanoparticle-functionalized graphene, in particular, graphene
   sheets containing Au nanoparticles (Au NPs), have generated considerable
   interest because of their unique optical and electrical characteristics.
   In this study, we successfully produced graphene sheets decorated with
   Au NPs (AuGrp) using phytochemicals as reducing agents. During this
   reaction, Au ions intercalated into the layered graphene flakes and were
   then reduced into NPs, exfoliating the graphene sheets. The
   physicochemical properties of the AuGrp nanocomposites were
   characterized, and the exfoliation process was investigated using a
   molecular dynamics simulation of Au NPs between graphene sheets. Our
   proposed technique is advantageous because the phytochemicals are mild
   reducing agents that preserve the graphene structure during exfoliation
   and NP decoration. The dispersity of the NPs on the graphene sheets was
   drastically improved due to the use of metal-ion intercalation.
   Moreover, the electrical conductivity was 6-30 times higher than that of
   bare graphene and reduced graphene oxide. Using antibody (Ab) modified
   AuGrp sheets and quantum dots, a plasmonic-induced photoluminescence
   immunoassay of tuberculosis (TB) antigen (aG) CFP-10 was demonstrated
   for a potential application of these materials. The enhancement of
   photoluminescence (PL) response was monitored depending on the various
   TB aG concentrations from 5.1 pg/mL to 51 mu g/mL, and the detection
   limit for CFP-10 was 4.5 pg/mL. Furthermore, the selectivity was
   demonstrated with Ag85 as the other TB aG, and PL enhancement was not
   observed in this case. Therefore, AuGrp-based immunoassay showed the
   potential for biosensor application.}},

Title = {{Reduced knee joint loading with lateral and medial wedge insoles for
   management of knee osteoarthritis: a protocol for a randomized
   controlled trial}},
Journal = {{BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Background: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) progression has been linked to
   increased peak external knee adduction moments (KAMs). Although some
   trials have attempted to reduce pain and improve function in OA by
   reducing KAMs with a wedged footwear insole intervention, KAM reduction
   has not been specifically controlled for in trial designs, potentially
   explaining the mixed results seen in the literature. Therefore, the
   primary purpose of this trial is to identify the effects of reduced KAMs
   on knee OA pain and function.
   Methods/design: Forty-six patients with radiographically confirmed
   diagnosis medial knee OA will be recruited for this 3 month randomized
   controlled trial. Recruitment will be from Alberta and surrounding
   areas. Eligibility criteria include being between the ages of 40 and 85
   years, have knee OA primarily localized to the medial tibiofemoral
   compartment, based on the American College of Rheumatology diagnostic
   criteria and be classified as having a Kellgren-Lawrence grade of 1 to
   3. Patients will visit the laboratory at baseline for testing that
   includes dual x-ray absorptiometry, biomechanical testing, and surveys
   (KOOS, PASE activity scale, UCLA activity scale, comfort visual analog
   scale). At baseline, patients will be randomized to either a wedged
   insole group to reduce KAMs, or a waitlist control group where no
   intervention is provided. The survey tests will be repeated at 3 months,
   and response to wedged insoles over 3 months will be evaluated.
   Discussion: This study represents the first step in systematically
   evaluating the effects of reduced KAMs on knee OA management by using a
   patient-specific wedged insole prescription procedure rather than
   providing the same insole to all patients. The results of this trial
   will provide indications as to whether reduced KAMs are an effective
   strategy for knee OA management, and whether a personalized approach to
   footwear insole prescription is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{During the Indian National Gas Hydrate Program (NGHP) Expedition 01,
   conducted between April-August 2006, a number of pressure cores
   containing gas hydrate-bearing sediments were recovered under in-situ
   pressures. Two of these cores (NGHP-01-10B-08Y and NGHP-01-21C-02E),
   after initial characterization, were sub-sectioned. They were then
   rapidly depressurized and frozen in liquid nitrogen. A number of
   sub-sections were delivered to the University of Southampton for further
   analysis. High-resolution 3-D X-ray computer tomography carried out in
   the first instance revealed that the structure and form of the hydrate
   within the host sediment had been preserved. However, the exsolution of
   free gas from the pore water during depressurization, and before the
   subsequent freezing, had caused the formation of significant voids
   within each sub-sections, precluding detailed testing of intact cores.
   Following this initial appraisal detailed soil characterization, such as
   particle size analysis, water content and salinity, were carried out on
   sub-samples from the core sections following thawing and dissociation of
   the hydrate. In addition, specific gravity and strength tests, including
   liquid and plastic limit and undrained triaxial compression tests, were
   carried out on the combined sediment from all the core sections. The
   results of these tests showed the sediment to be a high plasticity clay.
   The remoulded combined sediment had a relatively high water content, and
   low shear strength, considering the vertical effective stress to which
   the in-situ sediment had been subjected, therefore creating significant
   underconsolidation of the in-situ sediment.
   In this paper a number of hypotheses are presented in an attempt to
   explain this under-consolidation, including factors, such as the change
   in moisture content due to hydrate dissociation, over-pressure, the
   influence of salinity on sediment strength, as well as the effect of
   hydrate veins. It is considered likely that hydrate veins, enhancing
   sediment strength, were the main contributing factor to the apparent
   under-consolidation. Hydrate dissociation induced by production of gas
   hydrates within this underconsolidated sediment may potentially lead to
   seafloor instability and further research is required to assess this
   likelihood. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The expanded fluid (EF) viscosity model was implemented and further
   developed for efficient integration into a commercial process simulator
   (VMGSim (TM)). The model has three adjustable parameters per component
   and its inputs are density, pressure and low pressure gas viscosity. The
   model was adapted to use densities determined by the Rackett correlation
   (liquid phase) and the Advanced Peng-Robinson Equation of State (vapor
   phase). The enhanced EF model fit experimental viscosities of pure
   hydrocarbons, water and polar compounds important for the simulation of
   oil and natural gas systems with average absolute errors just above 5\%.
   The implemented EF model was tested against experimental viscosity data
   that included hydrocarbon and aqueous mixtures with average absolutes
   errors of 0.7 and 6.2\% respectively. Generalized expressions for the
   estimation interaction parameters of binary mixtures involving
   paraffins, naphthenes, aromatics, alcohols, glycols and water were
   obtained. The EF model was also applied to crude oil (bitumen) examples.
   The three key developments for the efficient implementation of the EF
   model in a commercial simulator were: (1) the appropriate selection of
   phase density models; (2) the automatic determination of model fluid
   specific parameters; and (3) the use of generalized mixing rules for the
   calculation of binary interaction parameters. (C) 2014 The Institution

Abstract = {{Tight oil formations (permeability < 1 mD) in Western Canada have
   recently emerged as a reliable resource of light oil supply owing to the
   use of multi-fractured horizontal wells. The Cardium formation, which
   contains 25\% of Alberta's total discovered light oil (according to
   Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board), consists of conventional
   and unconventional (low-permeability or tight) play areas. The
   conventional play areas have been developed since 1957. Contrarily, the
   development of unconventional play is a recent event, due to
   considerably poorer reservoir properties which increases the risk
   associated with capital investment. This in turn implies the need for a
   comprehensive and critical study of the area before planning any
   development strategy.
   This paper presents performance results from the low permeability
   portions of the Cardium formation where new horizontal wells have been
   drilled and stimulated in multiple stages to promote transverse
   hydraulic fractures. Development of the tight Cardium formation using
   primary recovery is considered. The production data of these wells was
   first matched using a black oil simulator. The calibrated model
   presented was used for performance perditions based on sensitivity
   studies and investigations that encompassed design factors such as well
   spacing, fracture properties and operational constraints.}},

Abstract = {{Underground Gas Storage (UGS) involves storage of large quantities of
   natural gas to support the natural gas demand in domestic, commercial
   and industrial areas. Storage of sour gas can be advantageous from
   economic standpoint, as it reduces treatment costs and increases the
   potential of production from shared reservoirs. This paper investigates
   feasibility of UGS in one of Iranian depleted fractured gas condensate
   reservoirs. Compositional simulation was employed to build dynamic
   reservoir model, develop the history matching phase of the reservoir and
   construct Injection/Withdrawal (I/W) cycles. One sweet gas stream and
   three sour gas streams with different compositions were tested for
   storage into reservoir during summer season. Results of simulation
   showed that presence of H2S and CO2 in the injected gas stream improves
   condensate production. Condensate Production Enhancement (CPE), defined
   as the percentage of condensate recovery increase due to sour gas
   injection relative to the sweet gas injection, was calculated for
   different compositions of storage gas. Also, Condensate Holding Ratio
   (CHR), defined as the ratio of condensate in the withdrawn sour gas to
   that in the withdrawn CH4, was estimated for different storage gas
   compositions.
   Results showed that CPE has a higher rate in earlier cycles and declines
   at later cycles. CHR is higher for sour gas storage compared to sweet
   gas. Furthermore, heating value of produced gas was calculated in all
   I/W cycles and compared with heating value of injected gas. It was
   indicated that difference between heating value of produced and injected
   gas increases with increase of H2S and CO2 content of the injected gas.
   Also, it was found that the reservoir has lower pressure rise at the end
   of I/W cycles in the case of underground sour gas storage compared to
   sweet gas storage. The presence of acid gas components decreases the
   z-factor of injected gas stream resulting in smaller difference between
   z-factors of injected gas and reservoir fluid.}},

Abstract = {{A biomedical microwave tomography system with 3D-imaging capabilities
   has been constructed and translated to the clinic. Updates to the
   hardware and reconfiguration of the electronic-network layouts in a more
   compartmentalized construct have streamlined system packaging. Upgrades
   to the data acquisition and microwave components have increased
   data-acquisition speeds and improved system performance. By
   incorporating analog-to-digital boards that accommodate the linear
   amplification and dynamic-range coverage our system requires, a complete
   set of data (for a fixed array position at a single frequency) is now
   acquired in 5.8 s. Replacement of key components (e. g., switches and
   power dividers) by devices with improved operational bandwidths has
   enhanced system response over a wider frequency range. High-integrity,
   low-power signals are routinely measured down to -130 dBm for
   frequencies ranging from 500 to 2300 MHz. Adequate inter-channel
   isolation has been maintained, and a dynamic range > 110 dB has been
   achieved for the full operating frequency range (500-2900 MHz). For our
   primary band of interest, the associated measurement deviations are less
   than 0.33\% and 0.5 degrees for signal amplitude and phase values,
   respectively. A modified monopole antenna array (composed of two
   interwoven eight-element sub-arrays), in conjunction with an updated
   motion-control system capable of independently moving the sub-arrays to
   various in-plane and cross-plane positions within the illumination
   chamber, has been configured in the new design for full volumetric data
   acquisition. Signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are more than adequate for
   all transmit/receive antenna pairs over the full frequency range and for
   the variety of in-plane and cross-plane configurations. For proximal
   receivers, in-plane SNRs greater than 80 dB are observed up to 2900 MHz,
   while cross-plane SNRs greater than 80 dB are seen for 6 cm sub-array
   spacing (for frequencies up to 1500 MHz). We demonstrate accurate
   recovery of 3D dielectric property distributions for breast-like
   phantoms with tumor inclusions utilizing both the in-plane and new
   cross-plane data. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Droplet microfluidics (DMF) is a fluidic handling technology that
   enables precision control over dispensing and subsequent manipulation of
   droplets in the volume range of microliters to picoliters, on a
   micro-fabricated device. There are several different droplet actuation
   methods, all of which can generate external stimuli, to either actively
   or passively control the shape and positioning of fluidic droplets over
   patterned substrates. In this review article, we focus on the operation
   and utility of electro-actuation-based DMF devices, which utilize one or
   more micro-/nano-patterned substrates to facilitate electric field-based
   handling of chemical and/or biological samples. The underlying theory of
   DMF actuations, device fabrication methods and integration of optical
   and opto-electronic detectors is discussed in this review. Example
   applications of such electro-actuation-based DMF devices have also been
   included, illustrating the various actuation methods and their utility
   in conducting chip-based laboratory and clinical diagnostic assays.}},

   protein can be engineered to bind virtually any DNA sequence of
   interest. The possibility of multiplexing TALEs for the purposes of
   identifying specific DNA sequences has yet to be explored. Here, we
   demonstrate a system in which a TALE protein bound to a nitrocellulose
   strip has been utilized to capture purified DNA, which is then detected
   using the binding of a second distinct TALE protein conjugated to a
   protein tag that is then detected by a dot blot. This system provides a
   signal only when both TALEs bind to their respective sequences, further
   demonstrating the specificity of the TALE binding.}},

Volume = {{124}},
Pages = {{264-274}},

Abstract = {{Identifying the range of dynamic reservoir performance responses
   requires conducting numerical flow modeling on geostatistical
   realizations. The extent of steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD)
   models, multiple horizontal well-pairs, and simultaneous flow of heat
   and fluids make a single SAGD simulation computationally burdensome.
   Therefore, it is impractical to simulate all hundreds of SAGD
   realizations. We have introduced a static measure based on average
   harmonic permeability called the (k(H))(A) method to help rank
   realizations for their SAGD performance. The high correlation between
   the (k(H))(A) method and the thermal simulation results shows that the
   (k(H))(A) method is a useful ranking tool and helps to select a few
   realizations exhibiting distinct responses for detailed flow modeling.
   By testing the method against several datasets, it is shown to be easy
   to apply, fast to run, reliable and robust compared to other methods.

Abstract = {{The increase in throughput or reduction in the operational costs is the
   common example of change in production criteria in retrofit projects. In
   this study, the condensate stabilization unit of a gas refinery, which

   considered for analysis and retrofifting study. This unit comprises of a
   two-stage compressor and a side-reboiler associated with the
   stabilization column that uses HP steam as hot utility. It is shown that
   by applying the optimum pressure drops method for debottlenecking of
   this unit, after 20\% increase in throughput, utility consumption can be
   maintained at existing level, if 1554 m(2) of additional heat transfer

Abstract = {{The basic SAR (solar-driven adsorption refrigeration) machine is an
   intermittent cold production system. Recently, the CO-SAR (continuous
   operation solar-powered adsorption refrigeration) system is developed.
   The CO-SAR machine is based on the theoretical CTAR (constant
   temperature adsorption refrigeration) cycle in which the adsorption
   process takes place at a constant temperature that equals the ambient
   temperature. Practically, there should be a temperature gradient between
   the adsorption bed and the surrounding atmosphere to provide a driving
   potential for heat transfer.
   In the present study, the dynamic analysis of the CTAR cycle is
   developed. This analysis provides a comparison between the theoretical
   and the dynamic operation of the CTAR cycle. The developed dynamic model
   is based on the D-A adsorption equilibrium equation and the energy and
   mass balances in the adsorption reactor. Results obtained from the
   present work demonstrate that, the idealization of the constant
   temperature adsorption process in the theoretical CTAR cycle is not far
   from the real situation and can be approached. Furthermore, enhancing
   the heat transfer between the adsorption bed and the ambient during the
   bed pre-cooling process helps accelerating the heat rejection process
   from the adsorption reactor and therefore approaching the isothermal
   process. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The peak external knee adduction moment (KAM) is implicated in
   progression of knee osteoarthritis (OA). Recently, hip abductor weakness
   has also been found in patients with knee OA; however, it remains
   unknown as to how or if this weakness is a consequence of OA, or a
   predisposing factor. If it is the latter, a direct relationship between
   hip strength and KAM magnitude would be expected. The purpose of this
   study was to evaluate the relationship between hip abductor strength and
   KAM magnitude during walking. In fourteen adults, maximal isometric hip
   abductor strength was measured, and the KAM was quantified during gait.
   Additionally, internal hip abductor moments, vertical and medial
   ground-reaction-forces (GRFs), and GRF to knee joint center lever-arms
   were quantified during gait. The relationship between hip strength and
   GRFs, lever-arms and KAM were assessed using correlation. Internal hip
   abductor moments were compared to maximum hip strength by paired samples
   t-test. Correlations between hip strength and the vertical GRF (r =
   -0.05, p = 0.87), medial GRF (r = -0.24, p = 0.41), lever arm (r =
   -0.01, p = 0.97), and KAM (r = -0.24, p = 0.41) were not statistically
   significant. Peak internal hip abductor moments during gait (1.1 +/- 0.2
   Nm/kg) were significantly lower than maximal hip abductor strength (1.8
   +/- 0.3 Nm/kg, p < 0.001). It is concluded that hip abductor strength is
   not related to KAM magnitude. It seems more likely that hip abductor
   weakness is a consequence of OA rather than a predisposing factor.}},

Title = {{A data mining approach to finding relationships between reservoir
   properties and oil production for CHOPS}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& GEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{37-47}},

Abstract = {{Cold heavy oil production with sand (CHOPS) is a primary oil extraction
   process for heavy crude oil and reservoir properties are key factors
   that contribute to the effectiveness of CHOPS. However, identification
   of the key reservoir properties and quantification of the relationships
   between the reservoir properties and the oil production are still
   challenging tasks. In this paper, we propose the use of a data mining
   approach for finding quantitative relationships between various
   reservoir properties and oil production for CHOPS. The approach includes
   four steps: firstly, a set of reservoir properties are identified to
   describe reservoir characteristics through a petrophysical analysis. In
   addition to common parameters, such as porosity and permeability, two
   new parameters - a fluid mobility factor and the maximum inscribed
   rectangular of net pay (MIRNP) - are proposed. Secondly, three new
   parameters to describe the production performance of wells are proposed:
   the peak value, effective life cycle and effective yield. Next, the
   fuzzy ranking method is used to rank the importance of the identified
   reservoir properties in terms of oil production. Finally, association
   rule mining is used to obtain quantitative relationships between
   reservoir property variables and the production performance of wells.
   The proposed methods have been applied for 118 wells in the Sparky
   Formation of the Lloydminster heavy oil field in Alberta. The result
   shows that the production performance of wells in the area could be
   described and predicted by using the found quantitative relations. (C)

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{14-25}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We present an analytical expression for the shear dispersion during
   solute transport in a coupled fracture-matrix system. The dispersion
   coefficient is obtained in a fracture with porous walls by taking into
   account an accurate boundary condition at the interface between the
   matrix and fracture, and the results were compared with those in a
   non-coupled system. The analysis presented identifies three regimes:
   diffusion-dominated, transition, and advection-dominated. The results
   showed that it is important to consider the exchange of solute between
   the fracture and matrix in development of the shear dispersion
   coefficient for the transition and advection-dominated regimes. The new
   dispersion coefficient is obtained by imposing the continuity of
   concentrations and mass fluxes along the porous walls. The resulting
   equivalent transport equation revealed that the effective velocity in a
   fracture increases while the dispersion coefficient decreases due to
   mass transfer between the matrix and fracture. A larger effective
   advection term leads to greater storage of mass in the matrix as
   compared with the classical double-porosity model with a non-coupled
   dispersion coefficient. The findings of this study can be used for
   modeling of tracer tests as well as fate, transport, and remediation of
   groundwater contaminants in fractured rocks. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Unified fractional differential approach for transient interporosity
   flow in naturally fractured media}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{302-317}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A unified approach to modeling flows of slightly compressible fluids
   through naturally fractured media is presented. The unified fractional
   differential model is derived by combining the flow at micro scale for
   matrix blocks and macro scale for fractures, using the transient
   interporosity flow behavior at the interface between matrix blocks and
   fractures. The derived model is able to unify existing transient
   interporosity flow models formulated for different shapes of matrix
   blocks in any medium dimensions. The model is formulated in the form of
   a fractional order partial differential equation that involves Caputo
   derivative of order 1/2 with respect to time. Explicit solutions for the
   unified model are derived for different axisymmetrical spatial domains
   using Hankel or Hankel-Weber finite or infinite transforms. Comparisons
   between the predictions of the unified model and those obtained from
   existing transient interporosity flow models for matrix blocks in the
   form of slabs, spheres and cylinders are presented. It is shown that the
   unified fractional derivative model leads to solutions that are very
   close to those of transient interporosity flow models for
   fracture-dominant and transitional fracture-to-matrix dominant flow
   regimes. An analysis of the results of the unified model reveals that
   the pressure varies linearly with the logarithm of time for different
   flow regimes, with half slope for the transitional fracture-to-matrix
   dominant flow regime vs. the fracture and matrix dominant flow regimes.
   In addition, a new re-scaling that involves the characteristic length in
   the form of matrix block volume to surface area ratio is derived for the
   transient interporosity flow models for matrix blocks of different
   shapes. It is shown that the re-scaled transient interporosity flow
   models are governed by two dimensionless parameters H and K compared to
   only one dimensionless parameter H for the unified model. It is shown
   that the solutions of the transient interporosity flow models for
   different shapes of matrix blocks are almost identical for the re-scaled
   variables. Furthermore, the driving parameters for solution behavior are
   identified based on asymptotic approximations for different flow
   regimes. It is found that the matrix diffusion and the matrix
   area-to-volume ratio affect the solution behavior only for the
   transitional fracture-to-matrix dominant flow regime, that the
   capacitance ratio affects the solution behavior only for transitional
   and matrix dominant flow regimes and that the fracture diffusion is
   involved in all three flow regimes. Similar identification of the
   driving parameters is also presented in the re-scaled case. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{As an important site-specific optical parameter widely used in climate
   models, the mass absorption efficiency (MAE) of elemental carbon (EC),
   varies dramatically with the source types and governs the direct
   radiative forcing (DRF) estimation In this study, the MAE of EC for
   ambient samples collected from four major emission areas in China, i.e,
   Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area (BTH), Yangtze River Delta area (YRD),
   Sichuan Basin area (SB), and Pearl River Delta area (PRD), as well as
   emissions from burning of residential honeycomb briquette, firewood and
   rice straw were investigated by using a filter-based method. The annual
   mean MAE(EC) over the four major emission areas is 7.51 m(2)/g. MAE(EC)
   in BTH and YRD during summer appears significantly higher than MAE(EC)
   in other seasons, while seasonal variations of MAE(EC) in SB and PRD
   suggest MAE(EC) in summer and autumn is higher than that in winter and
   spring. MAE(EC) for samples from fossil fuels burning and biomass
   open-burning is 2.10 times higher than that from residential biofuel
   burning, which could be one of the reasons for the higher MAE(EC) values
   during the seasons heavily affected by fossil fuels burning and biomass
   open-burning (i.e., summer and autumn) than winter for the four
   locations. Difference between the measured and AeroCom median value of
   MAE(EC) may cause underestimation of DRFEC over the studied area by a
   factor of 0.13. Spatial and temporal variations of MAE(EC) would also
   result in underestimations of DRFEC to different degrees varying with
   seasons and areas.}},

Abstract = {{The energy requirement for cooling residential and industrial buildings
   in the summertime is extensive, especially in hot weather countries.
   Solar energy contributes substantially to the cooling load. The solar
   intensity is usually high and can be about a kW/m(2). Besides, the
   cooling period or comfort conditions in those countries exceed 5 months
   and outdoor temperature can reach more than 40A degrees C. Any attempt
   to reduce the effect of solar energy on the cooling load is worthy of
   investigation. The present work analyzes using artificial, naturally
   ventilated, shading covers to reduce the effect of solar energy. A
   computational fluid dynamics approach is used to understand the physics
   of natural convection between an exterior wall of a building and an
   artificial shade. Since the building is air conditioned, it is expected
   that the exterior wall temperature may be less than the ambient
   temperature of a shaded wall. Hence, the analysis covered a wide range
   of rate of cooling of the exterior wall and assumed that the shading
   material is always at a higher temperature than the ambient due to solar
   energy.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a bandwidth extended digital predistortion system
   suitable for LTE-advanced applications. The proposed predistortion
   system uses a two-box architecture based on the cascade of a memory
   polynomial followed by a memoryless predistortion function. The
   memoryless predistorter is ident(i)fied offline and used to perform a
   coarse linearization which cancels out most of the static nonlinearity
   of the device under test allowing for a reduced observation bandwidth
   for the synthesis of the memory polynomial predistortion sub-function.
   The proposed predistorter was experimentally validated and its
   performance benchmarked against a predistorter having the same structure
   but identified using the conventional approach. The measurement results
   demonstrate that the proposed predistorter requires 30\% less sampling
   speed for the analog to digital converter of the feedback path.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{289-302}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The Pleistocene fluvio-tectonic conditions have shaped the landscapes of
   Sinai Peninsula through development of small sedimentary traps following
   preexisting lineaments. In the Gulf of Aqaba region, orientation of
   these lineaments with respect to the Pleistocene stress field develops
   strike-slip simple and dip-slip pure extensional shear models that
   induced rifting of the Gulf of Aqaba - Dead Sea fault system. The Beida
   and Nabq grabens are two major rift-related depressions at the
   southwestern coast of the Gulf of Aqaba region. Both grabens are
   landscapes that received alluvial sediments of the Kid drainage basin
   (KDB), which is one of the largest drainage systems in the western
   region of the Gulf of Aqaba fault-scarp. The Beida graben is formed at a
   horse tail structure next to Abiad and Kid faults, while the Nabq graben
   is a pull-apart structure formed as onshore continuation of the Dakar
   deep. The geometry and origin of these landscapes are the intrinsic
   themes of this study to investigate the morphotectonic evolution of the
   KDB terrain within the tectonic framework of the Gulf of Aqaba - Dead
   Sea rift.
   The hanging terraces and canyons being at higher elevations on the Gulf
   of Aqaba fault-scarp; and the accumulation of younger alluvial fans,
   talus cones and bajada on its footslope indicate that the KDB landscape
   is basically shaped; and evolutionary modified by hinterland uplifting
   of the Gulf of Aqaba region. Hence, two morphotectonic evolution periods
   of the KDB terrain coincide with the early NE- and late NNE-trending
   extensional Pleistocene axes. The early period started with deposition
   of the older alluvial fan sediments that emerged at the outlet of KDB,
   and partially buried the Gulf of Aqaba fault-scarp. Subsequent
   hinterland uplifting revived the Gulf of Aqaba fault-scarp with
   development of hanging alluvial and bed-rock terraces; and the older
   alluvial fan sediments are uplifted on the footwall of southward-dipping
   normal faults whose hanging-wall received sediments of younger alluvial
   fans. Nature of the sediments constituting the Quaternary paleolakes and
   rift-related depressions, and their structural settings in Sinai,
   indicate that the Sinai terrain is basically shaped by crustal uplifting
   of the southern Sinai massif with severe rifting at the Gulf of Aqaba
   region. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Developing a viable and functional bone scaffold in vitro that is
   capable of surviving and bearing mechanical load in vivo requires an
   understanding of the cell biology of osteoprogenitor cells, particularly
   how they are influenced by mechanical stimulation during cell
   differentiation and maturation. In this study, mechanical load was
   applied using a modified FlexCell plate to impart confined compression
   to collagen-I scaffolds seeded with undifferentiated murine embryonic
   stem cells. The activity, presence, and expression of
   osteoblast-cadherin (OB-Cad) and connexin-43, as well as various
   pluripotent and osteogenic markers were examined at 5-30 days of
   differentiation as cells were stimulated to differentiate to osteoblasts
   with and without applied mechanical load. Fluorescence recovery after
   photobleaching, immunofluorescence, viability, von Kossa, and real-time
   polymerase chain reaction assessments revealed that mechanical
   prestimulation of this cell-seeded scaffold altered the expression of
   OB-Cad and connexin-43 and resulted in significant differences in the
   structure and organization of mineralization present in the collagen
   matrix. Specifically, cells in gels that were loaded for 40 h after 5
   days of differentiation and then left to fully differentiate for 30 days
   produced a highly structured honeycomb-shaped mineralization in the
   matrix; an outcome that was previously shown to be indicative of late
   osteoblast/early osteocyte activity. This study highlights the potential
   of mechanical load to accelerate differentiation and enhance osteoblast
   communication and function during the differentiation process, and
   highlights a time point of cell differentiation within this scaffold to
   apply load in order to most effectively transduce a mechanical signal.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental program was conducted to investigate the combined
   effects of sustained load and freeze-thaw cycling exposure on the
   flexural behaviour of reinforced concrete (RC) beams strengthened in
   flexure using prestressed Near-Surface Mounted (NSM) Carbon Fibre
   Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) strips. Two sets of five large-scale simply
   supported rectangular RC beams (sets BS-F and BS-FS) were tested. Each
   set consisted of one un-strengthened control beam and four beams
   strengthened using NSM-CFRP strips prestressed to 0, 20, 40, and 60\% of
   the CFRP ultimate tensile strength. After strengthening, the beams from
   set BS-F were exposed to 500 freeze-thaw cycles. The beams from set
   BS-FS were exposed to 500 freezethaw cycles; simultaneously, each beam
   in this set was subjected to a sustained load representing 47\% of the
   theoretical ultimate capacity of the non-prestressed NSM-CFRP
   strengthened beam. Thereafter, the beams were tested at room temperature
   under static monotonic loading in four-point bending configuration until
   failure. The damage done to the beams due to environmental exposure and
   long-term loading was evaluated, and furthermore, the effects of
   sustained load and freeze-thaw exposure were discussed on the

Abstract = {{The results of out-of-plane strength tests on unreinforced and
   reinforced concrete masonry wallettes that were constructed using
   190x190x390-mm hollow concrete masonry units are reported in this paper.
   The reinforcement was external and was accomplished by spraying one side
   of the wallettes with layers of glass-fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP).
   Eight unreinforced and 28 reinforced wallettes were constructed and
   tested in four-point bending spanning either vertically or horizontally.
   Twelve additional reinforced wallettes were constructed but tested
   cantilevered from either the bottom or one of the sides and loaded
   either along the top or along the nonsupported side. Overall, the
   results indicate that the strength of unreinforced masonry can be
   greatly improved by external reinforcement. The behavior of the
   wallettes is also discussed, with the most worrisome observed behavior
   being the failure of the webs of the masonry units in the direction
   parallel to the direction of the applied loads. As part of the research,
   simplified models to predict the capacity of hollow concrete masonry
   externally reinforced with sprayed GFRP were also developed and
   presented in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Transient liquid phase (TLP) bonding of Mg-AZ31 and Ti-6Al-4V alloys was
   performed using pure thin Ni electro-deposited coat interlayer (12 mu

   joint interface was studied at a temperature range from 500 to 540
   degrees C, bonding time from 1 to 60 min and bonding pressure from 0 to
   0.8 MPa. The mechanisms of bond formation varied across the joint
   region, with solid-state diffusion dominant at the Ti-6Al-4V interface
   and eutectic diffusion at the Mg-AZ31 interface. Joint microstructure
   was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy
   dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to
   detect the formation of intermetallic phases at the fracture surface.
   The maximum joint shear strength of 61 MPa was obtained at a temperature
   of 520 degrees C, 20 min and at a bonding pressure of 0.2 MPa. This
   joint strength was three times the bond strength reported for joints
   made using adhesives and represents 50\% of the Mg-AZ31 alloy shear

Title = {{A steady-state heat-transfer model for solids deposition from waxy
   mixtures in a pipeline}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{137}},
Pages = {{346-359}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{A steady-state heat-transfer model is presented for the formation of a
   deposit-layer from wax-solvent `waxy' mixtures in a pipeline under
   turbulent flow. The waxy mixture is taken to enter the pipeline under
   the single-phase hot flow regime (where the average mixture temperature
   is higher than its wax appearance temperature, WAT) and, upon gradual
   cooling, the mixture transitions into the cold flow regime (where its
   average temperature is lower than its WAT). The cold flow regime is
   characterized by two-phase flow, in which solid particles are suspended
   in the liquid phase. The effect of deposit aging is incorporated via a
   shear-induced deformation approach proposed in the literature. The model
   predictions are reported for the deposit thickness, waxy mixture
   temperature, pressure drop and the rate of heat loss in the hot flow and
   cold flow regimes for a range of inlet mixture temperature, surrounding
   temperature, and the Reynolds number. The predicted deposit thickness is
   shown to increase axially in the hot flow regime, to reach a maximum as
   the liquid temperature approaches the WAT of the wax-solvent mixture,
   and to decrease gradually to zero in the cold flow regime. The trends in
   the model predictions compare satisfactorily with those reported from
   bench-scale experimental studies as well as the predictions from an
   unsteady state moving boundary problem formulation. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Pages = {{3520-3530}},

Abstract = {{Liquid reinfiltration is a significant process, which can considerably
   retard and slowdown the transport of oil, water and contaminants in
   fractured subsurface formations. However, accurate modeling of the
   reinfiltration via liquid bridges formed in a horizontal fracture or
   space between two rock porous blocks remains a controversial topic. In
   an attempt to improve an understanding of the problem, the
   reinfiltration from upper to lower matrix blocks through formation of
   liquid bridges is theoretically modeled by using generalization of the
   Lucas-Washburn theory for a porous medium, which takes into account
   pressure differences due to matrix capillary, gravity, inertia, viscous,
   and fracture capillary forces. The developed model results in a
   second-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE), which is
   solved numerically to obtain depth and rate of the reinfiltrated liquid
   versus time. The results showed that three reinfiltration regimes:
   including Early Time Regime (ETR) (z similar to t, q = constant), Middle
   Time Regime (MTR) (z similar to root t, q similar to 1/root t) and Late
   Time Regime (LTR) (z similar to t, q = constant) can be observed, where
   the inertia, viscous, and gravity forces are dominant, respectively. The
   results also indicated that by increasing the permeability of the porous
   medium, the durations of the ETR (z similar to t, q = constant) and the
   LTR (z similar to t, q = constant) are prolonged while the duration of
   the MTR (z similar to root t, q similar to 1/root t) is reduced.
   Moreover, the results revealed that by increasing the liquid viscosity,
   the durations of the ETR (z similar to t, q = constant) and LTR (z
   similar to t, q = constant) are reduced whereas the duration of the MTR
   (z similar to root t, q similar to 1 root t) is prolonged. In addition,
   the results showed that in the case of high permeability of the porous
   medium when the fracture capillary pressure is strong enough only the
   LTR (z similar to t, q = constant) can be observed. The MTR (z similar
   to root t, q similar to 1 root t) and the LTR (z similar to t, q =
   constant) scalings are of practical significance since the liquid
   reinfiltration in fractured rocks associated with gas-liquid drainage
   mechanism is a very slow process. These findings advance the
   understanding of the two-phase flow in fractured porous media. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), obtained by different methods from carbon
   nanotubes (CNTs) or graphene, are attractive materials for polymer
   nanocomposites due to their considerably high interfacial area, as
   compared to CNTs. Consequently, a better adhesion with a polymer matrix
   is anticipated for GNRs. Also, surface modification of these
   nanofillers, such as nitrogen doping, is known to be an efficient method
   to improve their properties. In this work, fluoroelastomers (FKM) were
   used as the polymer matrix to host GNRs. Undoped and nitrogen doped GNRs
   were synthesized from the parent multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs).
   MWCNT/FKM and GNR/FKM nanocomposites were prepared via a solution
   mixing/melt mixing protocol.
   Adding nanofillers can affect the crosslinking density of cross-linked
   polymers, such as elastomers and rubbers. The effect of interfacial
   interaction between the functional groups on the surface of the GNR and
   FKM matrix have been studied in this project. Our results showed that
   the concentration and type of the surface functional groups were the
   main contributors in determining the cure behavior of the
   nanocomposites. While reduced nitrogen doped GNR (CNx-GNR) had a similar
   cure behavior as neat FKM, oxidized GNRs had relatively slower cure
   kinetics. These observations were found to be correlated with the
   presence of a hydroxyl functional group on the surface of oxidized GNRs
   (CNx-GONR). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{With more than 170 billion barrels of estimated oil sands reserves in
   Canada, Canada has the third largest oil reserves in the world. However,
   more than 80\% of oil sand's reserves are located deep underground and
   could not be accessed by surface mining. Nonetheless, a number of
   in-situ recovery methods have been developed to extract heavy oil and
   bitumen from deep reservoirs. Once produced, bitumen is transferred to
   upgraders converting low quality oil to synthetic crude oil. However, in
   the present context, heavy oil and bitumen exploitation process is not
   just high-energy and water intensive, but also it has significant
   environmental footprints as it produces significant amount of gaseous
   emissions and wastewater. In addition, the level of contaminants in
   bitumen requires special equipment, and has also environmental
   repercussions.
   Recently, nanotechnology has emerged as an alternative technology for
   in-situ heavy oil upgrading and recovery enhancement. Nanoparticle
   catalysts (nanocatalysts) are one of the important examples on
   nanotechnology applications. Nanocatalysts portray unique catalytic and
   sorption properties due to their exceptionally high surface
   area-to-volume ratio and active surface sites. In-situ catalytic
   conversion or upgrading of heavy oil with the aid of multi-metallic
   nanocatalysts is a promising cost effective and environmentally friendly
   technology for production of high quality oils that meet pipeline and
   refinery specifications. Further, nanoparticles could be employed as
   inhibitors for preventing or delaying asphaltene precipitation and
   subsequently enhance oil recovery. Nevertheless, as with any new
   technologies, there are a number of challenges facing the employment of
   nanoparticles for in-situ catalytic upgrading and recovery enhancement.
   The main goal of this article is to provide an overview of nanoparticle
   technology usage for enhancing the in-situ catalytic upgrading and
   recovery processes of crude oil. Furthermore, the article sheds lights
   on the advantages of employment of nanoparticles in heavy oil industry
   and addresses some of the limitations and challenges facing this new
   technology. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The main purpose of this research was the development of a mixed
   catalyst-sorbent for gasification and in situ CO2 capture; therefore,
   novel mixed catalyst-sorbent (composite) pellets were prepared with
   different contents of potassium carbonate and calcium oxide as the
   catalyst and sorbent, respectively. The pellets were used in steam
   gasification experiments of two different types of coal. The maximum
   hydrogen yield of 80\% was obtained with 50\% of the catalyst in the
   composite pellets and lignite Boundary Dam (BD) coal at 700 degrees C.
   Use of the catalyst enhanced the gasification and water-gas shift (WGS)
   reaction rates, while the capture of carbon dioxide (CO2) shifted the
   WGS equilibrium forward, favoring hydrogen production. Trace amounts of
   CO2 and carbon monoxide were detected. In terms of maximum achievable
   hydrogen yield, the pellets containing 50\% catalyst demonstrated the
   best performance. As expected, BD coal (a low-rank coal) showed a higher
   reactivity than the Genesee sub-bituminous (a medium-rank coal) samples.
   Ultimate analyses and burn-off tests were performed on the residues to
   determine the amounts of unconverted carbon, and the results of these
   tests also confirmed the best performance of the pellets with a catalyst
   content of 50\%. Despite the decreasing trend of pore surface area with
   increasing catalyst percentage, increasing the catalyst content of
   composite pellets to a certain level had a positive effect on hydrogen
   production. This indicates that the performance of pellets is almost
   independent of the pore surface area. Indeed, the optimal ratio is the
   result of the trade-off among pore surface area, dispersion, formation
   of a bimetallic solid phase, and the concentration of active catalyst
   sites on the pellets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Pages = {{295-306}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Branched-preformed particle gel (B-PPG) is a newly developed chemical
   agent for enhanced oil recovery in heterogeneous reservoirs. In this
   paper, laboratory experiments are performed to characterize the
   morphology and rheological properties of a B-PPG suspension in water,
   investigate its transport behavior through heterogeneous porous media,
   and study its performance in enhanced oil recovery in heterogeneous
   reservoirs. In the flow and displacement experiments, parallel-sandpack
   models are used to represent the heterogeneous porous media. The
   experimental results show that the viscoelasticity of the B-PPG
   suspension makes it a promising agent for both conformance control and
   enhanced oil recovery in heterogeneous reservoirs. Both B-PPG flow and
   tertiary oil recovery tests in parallel-sandpack models demonstrate that
   injection of a B-PPG slug can effectively improve the sweep efficiency
   and recover more residual oil in the low permeability zones. For a more
   heterogenous model, the effect of B-PPG on the sweep efficiency becomes
   more noticeable. This is because the viscoelastic B-PPG particles not
   only increase the viscosity of the water phase, but also divert the flow
   to the unswept low permeability zones. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   recover the damage caused by punching. In this paper, samples are
   annealed at 750 degrees C for an hour under a N-2 atmosphere. The
   damaged regions and corresponding recovery after annealing are observed
   under microscope as the measured core losses are improved up to 37\%.
   The SRM performance is measured and it is found that the torque density
   can be enhanced when using the annealed electrical steel.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates a slug-flow expander (SFE) for conversion of
   high-pressure gas/vapor into kinetic energy of liquid slugs. The energy
   transfer from high-pressure to kinetic energy is quantified using thrust
   plate measurements. Non-dimensional thrust data is used to quantify
   performance by normalizing measured thrust by thrust for the same water
   flow rate at zero air flow rate. A total of 13 expander configurations
   are investigated and geometries with the shortest cavity length and the
   smallest exit diameter are found to result in the largest
   non-dimensional thrust increase. Results show that thrust augmentation
   increases with the initiation of slug flow in the SFE. The analysis
   performed on the normalized thrust readings suggested that as the water
   and air flow were increased to critical conditions, the liquid slugs
   produced by the SFE augmented the thrust measurements. The final
   performance evaluation was based on linear regression of the normalized
   thrust measurements where slug flow was generated for each SFE
   architecture. Greater magnitudes of the slope from the linear regression
   indicated the propensity of the SFE to augment thrust. This analysis
   confirmed that for the SFE configurations over the range of values
   investigated, the SFE increased thrust up to three times its original
   value at no air flow. Given the inherent multiphase nature of the
   slug-flow expander, application to systems involving expansion of
   wetting fluids (water as part of a waste-heat recovery system) or air
   with water droplet formation (as part of a compressed-air energy storage
   system) could be considered.}},

Abstract = {{Interface management (IM) is a main factor in the success of

   impacts a project's performance measurements, such as scope control and

   conducted in this research. The first identifies the top ten interface
   problems that affect IM. The second phase includes enhancing project
   performance by developing and applying multiple regression analysis
   models between the underlying interface problem factors and the project
   performance indicators. The last phase includes measuring the severity
   of the impact of each IM problem to develop an IM risk analysis model.
   The results of the multiple regression models indicate that the
   interface problems caused by the ``technical engineering and site issues
   factor{''}, the ``bidding and contracting factor{''}, and the
   ``information factor{''} were the strongest influences on the schedule

   highly nonlinear PA prototype using a minimal number of coefficients,
   revealing the attractive properties of the proposed method and its

   achieving similar linearization performance while requiring
   significantly less coefficients than the traditional models were

Abstract = {{A constant-volume reactor was used for measuring the solidvaporliquid
   equilibrium conditions of semiclathrates formed in aqueous solutions of
   tetra-n-butyl ammonium bromide (TBAB) and tetra-n-butyl ammonium
   chloride (TBAC). The TBAB and TBAC semiclathrates were formed from pure
   Ar and pure Xe. The experimental temperatures ranged from (284 to 303)
   K, the experimental pressures ranged from (266 to 6114) kPa, the
   concentration of TBAB ranged from w(TBAB) = (0.05 to 0.20), and the
   concentration of TBAC ranged from wTBAC = (0.05 to 0.20). As expected,
   at a given temperature, the pressure required to form TBAB and TBAC
   semiclathrates with argon and with xenon was much lower than the
   pressure that was required to form pure gas hydrates. From the
   equilibrium data, the enthalpy of formation was estimated to be between
   (133 and 188) kJ.mol(-1) for semiclathrates formed from argon and (55
   and 127) kJ.mol(-1) for semiclathrates formed from xenon.}},

Abstract = {{Geography Markup Language (GML) has become a de facto standard for
   encoding and exchanging geographic data. Usually, GML documents are of
   huge size due to its verbose structures and textual data, hence it is
   very costly to store and transit them. In this paper, we propose an
   effective pattern-based approach to compressing GML documents. First, a
   tree-structured pattern from the GML document under compression is
   extracted. Then, a tree automaton for matching the document against the
   extracted pattern is constructed. While doing compression, the GML
   document is matched against the pattern to generate a bits-stream that
   represents the difference between the document's structure and the
   extracted pattern. Meanwhile, we separate document structure from
   document content and group document content into different streams
   according to the tags. Spatial coordinate data are compressed by delta
   encoding. Finally, the extracted pattern, all streams and encodings are
   forwarded to a text compressor gzip. Extensive experiments on real GML
   documents show that the proposed approach outperforms the existing XML
   and GML compression approaches in compression ratio, while keeping an
   acceptable compression efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Many of the existing antennas described in current literature utilize
   PIN diodes to achieve switchable polarization. In realizing more
   elaborate reconfigurable antennas, the biasing structures for these
   DC-controlled components become more complex, which leads to limitations
   in the RF design as well as losses and undesired radiation. Other
   reconfigurable technologies, such as MEMS switches and liquid crystals,
   could be chosen for a particular application depending on various
   trade-offs, for example efficiency and ease of implementation. An
   alternative system is a recently developed scheme of using pneumatically
   controlled solid dielectric slugs, which is low-loss and immune to RF
   distortion, and eliminates the need for DC biasing structures. To
   demonstrate the viability of this system, it was incorporated in the
   design of a reconfigurable ring slot antenna capable of three
   polarization states (LP/LHCP/RHCP) at 2.4 GHz. The measured axial-ratio
   bandwidth was 5\%, which is comparable to similar low-profile antennas.
   The simulated and measured antenna performance at all three states
   showed strong correlation. The pneumatic actuation of four slugs inside
   a channel to realize the three different states was successfully
   implemented, demonstrating that pneumatic slug control technology is
   suitable for inclusion in reconfigurable antennas.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-arm spiral antenna, of N arms, can have N modes of operation.
   The integer represents the operating mode which is determined by the
   signal phase increment between adjacent arms as fed from the antenna
   terminals. For the antenna to radiate effectively, the active region
   must be enclosed by a circumference of mode number (n) times the
   operating wavelength. Each mode generates a different radiation pattern.
   Modes, with between 2 and, are capable of forming radiation pattern
   nulls. This paper shows a way to excite noninteger modes along with
   integer modes of radiation, which combined, can create a null which can
   be steered away from the antenna vertical bore sight. Furthermore,
   variable reactive loading of spiral arm ends offers additional steering
   control and positioning of nulls in a 2D angular hemispherical space.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a 4-bit noninterleaved single-clock-phase 10-GS/s
   analog-to-digital converter (ADC) fabricated in TSMC 65-nm CMOS
   technology. The ADC is realized using novel switched dynamic comparators
   (SDCs), which alleviate the clock-frequency-limiting long regeneration
   time in prior-art dynamic comparators, and avoid the phase-skew issue
   associated with time-interleaved ADCs that limits their
   signal-to-noiseand-distortion ratio (SNDR) and spurious-free dynamic
   range. The SDC employs a reference-free topology and has no static power
   consumption. The trip voltage errors of the SDCs are corrected by an
   efficient on-chip digital background calibration technique. The
   noninterleaved ADC presents an estimated 100 fF of capacitance at its
   input, excluding bondpad capacitance, with most of it contributed by the
   traces leading to the ADC and the shielding structures associated with
   the input traces. At 10-GS/s sampling rate, the prototype ADC achieves
   an SNDR of 24.9 dB {[}3.84 effective number of bit (ENOB)], and 23.4 dB
   (3.59 ENOB) at low input signal frequencies and Nyquist, respectively.
   The chip consumes 104 mW from a 1.3 V supply. The ADC has an active area
   of 0.1 mm(2).}},

Abstract = {{Background: Measuring dynamic in vivo shoulder kinematics is crucial to
   better understanding numerous pathologies. Motion capture systems using
   skin-mounted markers offer good solutions for non-invasive assessment of
   shoulder kinematics during dynamic movement. However, none of the
   current motion capture techniques have been used to study translation
   values at the joint, which is crucial to assess shoulder instability.
   The aim of the present study was to develop a dedicated patient-specific
   measurement technique based on motion capture and magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) to determine shoulder kinematics accurately.
   Hypothesis: Estimation of both rotations and translations at the
   shoulder joint using motion capture is feasible thanks to a
   patient-specific kinematic chain of the shoulder complex reconstructed
   from MRI data.
   Materials and methods: We implemented a patient-specific kinematic chain
   model of the shoulder complex with loose constraints on joint
   translation. To assess the effectiveness of the technique, six subjects
   underwent data acquisition simultaneously with fluoroscopy and motion
   capture during flexion and empty-can abduction. The reference 3D
   shoulder kinematics was reconstructed from fluoroscopy and compared to
   that obtained from the new technique using skin markers.
   Results: Root mean square errors (RMSE) for shoulder orientation were
   within 4 degrees (mean range: 2.0 degrees-3.4 degrees) for each
   anatomical axis and each motion. For glenohumeral translations, maximum
   RMSE for flexion was 3.7 mm and 3.5 mm for empty-can abduction (mean
   range: 1.9-3.3 mm). Although the translation errors were significant,
   the computed patterns of humeral translation showed good agreement with
   published data.
   Discussion: To our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to
   calculate both rotations and translations at the shoulder joint based on
   skin-mounted markers. Results were encouraging and can serve as
   reference for future developments. The proposed technique could provide
   valuable kinematic data for the study of shoulder pathologies. (C) 2014

   nanocomposites in a micro injection molding machine. Compression molding
   was applied to fabricate unfoamed nanocomposites for comparison
   purposes. Comparing the dielectric properties of unfoamed and foamed
   nanocomposites showed that foaming increased the percolation threshold,
   reduced DC and AC conductivities, widened the insulator-conductor
   transition window, and reduced the dissipation factor of the MWCNT/PS
   composites. These were attributed to deteriorated conductive network and
   inferior dispersion and distribution of MWCNTs coming from the presence
   of foam cells in the nanocomposites. The obtained results propose
   foaming as a promising technique to improve the dielectric properties of

Abstract = {{This paper presents an approach for the automatic registration of
   terrestrial laser scans using linear features. The main contribution
   here is introducing a new matching strategy that uses an association
   matrix to store information about candidate matches of linear features.
   The motivation for this work is aiding the 3D modeling of industrial
   sites rich with pole-like features. The proposed matching strategy aims
   at establishing hypotheses about potential minimal matches of linear
   features that could be used for the estimation of the transformation
   parameters relating the scans; then, quantifying the agreement between
   the scans using the estimated transformation parameters. We combine the
   association matrix and the well-known RANSAC approach for the derivation
   of conjugate pairs among the two scans. Rather than randomly selecting
   the line pairs as in the RANSAC-based registration, the association
   matrix guides the process of selecting the candidate matches of linear
   features. Experiments are conducted using laser scanning data of an
   electrical substation to assess the performance of the proposed
   association-matrix-based sample consensus approach as it compares to the
   traditional RANSAC-based procedure. The association-matrix-based
   approach showed consistent tendency of bringing up the correct matches
   first before the RANSAC-based registration.}},

Abstract = {{This work concerns the investigation of foam application to enhance
   heavy oil recovery through stability analysis tests, core floods, and
   data assessment. Monitoring transient behaviour of foam heights in a
   glass column showed that salt/alkaline concentration/type significantly
   affects the stability of foam. Meanwhile, the ionic nature of the
   surfactant and gas type also plays a crucial role. Therefore, the foam
   stability analysis should be helpful for the successful design of foam
   floods in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) processes. The surfactants that
   gave the most stable foam were used in core floods, and found that an
   increase in surfactant alternating gas (SAG) ratio decreases the oil
   recovery; furthermore, the efficiency of Cetrimonium Bromide (CTAB) is
   lower than that of Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) in a sandstone core.
   Finally, the Leverage approach was used to assess the obtained data
   points of stability as well as core flooding tests through the developed
   least square supported vector machine (LS-SVM) models. It confirms the
   validity of experimental data.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{73-85}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes the incorporation of a Bayesian learning algorithm
   into an agent-based model designed to simulate stakeholders' negotiation
   when evaluating scenarios of land development. The objective is to
   facilitate reaching an agreement at an earlier stage in the negotiation
   by providing the opportunity to the proposer agent to learn his
   opponents' preferences. The modeling approach is tested in the Elbow
   River watershed, in southern Alberta, Canada, that is under considerable
   pressure for land development due to the proximity of the fast growing
   city of Calgary. Five agents are included in the model respectively
   referred to as the Developer agent, the Planner agent, the Citizen
   agent, the Agriculture-Concerned agent, and the WaterConcerned agent.
   Two types of land development scenarios are evaluated; in the first
   case, only the geographical location is considered while in the second
   case, the internal land-use composition is also varied. The Developer
   agent that is equipped with the Bayesian learning capability attempts to
   approximate its opponents' fuzzy evaluation functions based on the
   responses he receives from them at each round of the negotiation. The
   results indicate that using this approach, an agreement can be reached
   in fewer number of negotiation rounds than in the case where the
   Developer agent selects the subsequent offers based merely on its own
   utility. The model also indicates how the satisfaction of each agent
   evolves during the negotiation. This information is very useful for
   decision makers who wish to consider stakeholders' perspectives when
   dealing with multiple objectives in a spatial context. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {{Energy Redistribution Between the Mean and Pulsating Flow Field in a
   Separated Flow Region}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{One of the main features of the backward-facing step (BFS) low frequency
   pulsatile flow is the unsteadiness due to the convection of vortical
   (coherent) structures, which characterize the flow dynamics in the shear
   layer. The physics of the flow field is analyzed by looking at energy
   redistribution between the mean and pulsating flow field obtained via a
   particle image velocimeter (PIV) using the concept of a triple
   decomposition. The total fluctuating kinetic budget is calculated and
   discussed for a mean Reynolds number of 100 and for 0.035 <= St <= 2.19.
   The effects that these coherent structures have on the fluctuating
   kinetic energy production, dissipation, and transport mechanism are
   examined. The results provide insight into the physics of the flow and
   suggest reasons for vortex growth and decay. Fluctuating kinetic energy
   is generally produced at the separated shear layers and transported
   towards the core flow and then to the upper and lower walls where
   viscosity dissipates the energy. The remaining energy is transported
   streamwise and decays as it is convected downstream (St = 0.4 and 1
   cases). It was also found that the pressure-velocity correlation
   diffusion plays a significant role in the transport of kinetic energy
   and Reynolds stresses, especially in the separated shear layer. More
   energy was dissipated at the walls for the high Strouhal number case St
   = 2.19 due to the transverse pressure diffusion term being increasingly
   dominant. This could be the reason why the convected primary vortices
   were much smaller in size and weaker with no upper wall vortices formed
   at this pulsation Strouhal number. The shear production for St = 0.035
   was very minimal; thus, the vortices died down quickly even before the
   shedding could happen. Finally, the pressure-strain correlation term was
   found to be significant in redistributing the kinetic energy from
   u-component to v-component.}},

Abstract = {{Formation water from oilfields is one of the major environmental issues
   related to the oil industry. This research investigated oil adsorption
   onto nanoparticles of hydrophobic alumina and alumina nanopartides
   functionalized with a petroleum vacuum residue (VR) at 2 and 4 wt\% to
   reduce the amount of oil in oil-saltwater emulsions at different pH
   values (5,7 and 9). The initial concentration of crude oil in water
   ranged from 100 to 500 mg/L. The change in oil concentration after
   adsorption was determined using a UV-vis spectrophotometer. The results
   indicated that all of the systems performed more effectively at a pH of
   7 and using Al/4VR material. The oil adsorption was higher for neutral
   and acid systems compared with basic ones, and it was improved by
   increasing the amount of VR on the surface of the alumina. Additionally,
   the amount of NaCl adsorbed onto nanoparticles was estimated for
   different mixtures. The adsorption equilibrium and kinetics were
   evaluated using the Dubinin-Astakhov model, the Brunauer-Emmet-Teller
   model, and pseudo-first- and pseudo-second-order models, with a better
   fitting to the Brunauer-Emmet-Teller model and pseudo-second-order

Abstract = {{We applied shape modeling and principal component analysis (PCA) to
   discover glenoid bone structural relationships relevant to improving
   glenoid prosthesis features, fixation, and instrumentation. Knowledge of
   external bone morphology guides prosthesis shape and positioning, while
   internal bone morphology and bone density influence fixation. CT-based
   modeling defined nonarthritic glenoid subchondral bone surface and
   internal structure. First and second principal shape components were
   related to size and density. Reproducible structural parameters and
   glenoid feature relationships were discovered. Subchondral bone surface
   was approximated by a circle inferiorly and a triangle superiorly with
   the circle's center at a reproducible point along a superior-inferior
   line. Glenoid vault's maximum depth was at the circle's center, and the
   highest bone density was in posterior glenoid. Glenoid subchondral bone
   surface version varied from superior to inferior, but not by sex or
   side. Male subchondral bone surfaces were larger and more retroverted.
   Even if subchondral bone surfaces are deformed by arthritis, glenoid
   morphology can be identified by extra-articular landmarks, permitting
   location of the glenoid center and scapular orientation (glenoid
   version). Knowledge obtained from this study directs design of novel
   prosthesis features and instrumentation for use without pre-op CT or
   computer aided surgery. (c) 2014 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A two-dimensional transient heat conduction model is developed that
   predicts heat transfer from a horizontal wellbore to the formation
   during a steam circulation process. The model takes into account the
   partial penetration of the wellbore, which is not included in previously
   developed analytical models applicable for reservoir heating. This
   inclusion makes the problem mathematically challenging as the inner
   boundary condition of the problem becomes non-homogenous. The governing
   heat conduction equation is solved for an infinite acting reservoir and
   semi-analytical solutions for the heat flux from the wellbore and
   temperature distribution in the formation are obtained using a
   combination of Laplace and finite Fourier cosine transforms. The average
   formation temperature and the heat flow across the wellbore are
   calculated and the results are presented. This analysis has applications
   in thermal stimulation of oil wells with low injectivity, where it is
   required to preheat the formation prior to steam injection. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The transient liquid phase (TLP) bonding of Ti-6Al-4V alloy to a Mg-AZ31
   alloy was performed using an electrodeposited Ni coating containing a
   dispersion of Ni and Cu nanoparticles. Bond formation was attributed to
   two mechanisms; first, solid-state diffusion of Ni and Mg, followed by
   liquid eutectic formation at the Mg-AZ31 interface. Second, the
   solid-state diffusion of Ni and Ti at the Ti-6Al-4V interface resulted
   in a metallurgical joint. The joint interface was characterized by
   scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and
   X-ray diffraction analysis. Microhardness and shear strength tests were
   used to investigate the mechanical properties of the bonds. The use of
   Cu nanoparticles as a dispersion produced the maximum joint shear
   strength of 69 MPa. This shear strength value corresponded to a 15 \%
   enhancement in joint strength compared to TLP bonds made without the use

Title = {{Applications of the MapReduce programming framework to clinical big data
   analysis: current landscape and future trends}},
Journal = {{BIODATA MINING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{OCT 29}},
Abstract = {{The emergence of massive datasets in a clinical setting presents both
   challenges and opportunities in data storage and analysis. This so
   called ``big data{''} challenges traditional analytic tools and will
   increasingly require novel solutions adapted from other fields. Advances
   in information and communication technology present the most viable
   solutions to big data analysis in terms of efficiency and scalability.
   It is vital those big data solutions are multithreaded and that data
   access approaches be precisely tailored to large volumes of
   semi-structured/unstructured data.
   The MapReduce programming framework uses two tasks common in functional
   programming: Map and Reduce. MapReduce is a new parallel processing
   framework and Hadoop is its open-source implementation on a single
   computing node or on clusters. Compared with existing parallel
   processing paradigms (e.g. grid computing and graphical processing unit
   (GPU)), MapReduce and Hadoop have two advantages: 1) fault-tolerant
   storage resulting in reliable data processing by replicating the
   computing tasks, and cloning the data chunks on different computing
   nodes across the computing cluster; 2) high-throughput data processing
   via a batch processing framework and the Hadoop distributed file system
   (HDFS). Data are stored in the HDFS and made available to the slave
   nodes for computation.
   In this paper, we review the existing applications of the MapReduce
   programming framework and its implementation platform Hadoop in clinical
   big data and related medical health informatics fields. The usage of
   MapReduce and Hadoop on a distributed system represents a significant
   advance in clinical big data processing and utilization, and opens up
   new opportunities in the emerging era of big data analytics. The
   objective of this paper is to summarize the state-of-the-art efforts in
   clinical big data analytics and highlight what might be needed to
   enhance the outcomes of clinical big data analytics tools. This paper is
   concluded by summarizing the potential usage of the MapReduce
   programming framework and Hadoop platform to process huge volumes of
   clinical data in medical health informatics related fields.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the problem of short-term wind power production
   forecasting based on meteorological information. Aggregated wind power
   forecasts are produced for multiple wind farms using a hybrid
   intelligent algorithm that uses a data filtering technique based on
   wavelet transform (WT) and a soft computing model (SCM) based on neural
   network (NN), which is optimized by using particle swarm optimization
   (PSO) algorithm. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid
   intelligent WT+NNPSO model, which takes into account the interactions of
   wind power, wind speed, wind direction, and temperature in the forecast
   process, the real data of wind farms located in the southern Alberta,
   Canada, are used to train and test the proposed model. The test results
   produced by the proposed hybrid WT+NNPSO model are compared with other
   SCMs as well as the benchmark persistence method. Simulation results
   demonstrate that the proposed technique is capable of performing
   effectively with the variability and intermittency of wind power
   generation series in order to produce accurate wind power forecasts.

Abstract = {{Highly stabilized mesoporous core shell-structured CaO-based spheriform
   CO2 sorbents are fabricated, for the first time, by a novel repeated
   impregnation coating process combined with the mesoscopic
   surfactant-templating method. By adopting our established wet-coating
   strategy along with a sol gel process, different mesoporous
   material-shelled sorbents with various shell thicknesses (1-5 mu m) and
   shell compositions (silica/zirconia or pure zirconia) are synthesized.
   Cyclic CO2 capture performance is tested in a thermogravimetric analyzer
   with the core shell pellet sorbents with a similar to 1 mu m mesoporous
   zirconia shell exhibiting an unprecedented CO2 uptake capacity of
   similar to 7.2 moles CO2 per kg decarbonated sorbent and the lowest
   activity loss of only 30.8\% after 20 cycles. This is attributed to the
   unique core shell coating strategy in which the thermally stable Zr
   species prevent the aggregation and overgrowth of CaO crystals and
   sorbent sintering. When comparing the core shell sorbents with
   Si-contained mesoporous shells, zirconia shelled ones exhibit
   significantly more outstanding performance. An attrition study using an
   air-jet apparatus under the standard test method reveals that the
   mesoporous zirconia shelled sorbent exhibits enhanced attrition
   resistance, which is also attributed to the novel core shell design,
   offering protection for the reactive core.}},

Abstract = {{Finite element (FE) models of bone derived from quantitative computed
   tomography (QCT) rely on realistic material properties to accurately
   predict bone strength. QCT cannot resolve bone microarchitecture,
   therefore QCT-based FE models lack the anisotropy apparent within the
   underlying bone tissue. This study proposes a method for mapping femoral
   anisotropy using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed
   tomography (HR-pQCT) scans of human cadaver specimens. Femur HR-pQCT
   images were sub-divided into numerous overlapping cubic sub-volumes and
   the local anisotropy was quantified using a `direct-mechanics' method.
   The resulting directionality reflected all the major stress lines
   visible within the trabecular lattice, and provided a realistic estimate
   of the alignment of Harvesian systems within the cortical compartment.
   QCT-based FE models of the proximal femur were constructed with
   isotropic and anisotropic material properties, with directionality
   interpolated from the map of anisotropy. Models were loaded in a
   sideways fall configuration and the resulting whole bone stiffness was
   compared to experimental stiffness and ultimate strength. Anisotropic
   models were consistently less stiff, but no statistically significant
   differences in correlation were observed between material models against
   experimental data. The mean difference in whole bone stiffness between
   model types was approximately 26\%, suggesting that anisotropy can still
   effect considerable change in the mechanics of proximal femur models.
   The under prediction of whole bone stiffness in anisotropic models
   suggests that the orthotropic elastic constants require further
   investigation. The ability to map mechanical anisotropy from
   high-resolution images and interpolate information into
   clinical-resolution models will allow testing of new anisotropic
   material mapping strategies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The development of an economically attractive process with abundant and
   readily available raw feedstocks to achieve the upgrading of biomass is
   highly desirable. Unlike conventional fast pyrolysis followed by
   hydrotreating for upgraded bio-oil production under high pressure in
   which expensive and naturally unavailable hydrogen is heavily engaged,
   this work clearly demonstrates the feasibility of upgrading biomass by
   directly using cheap natural gas on zeolite-supported catalyst at
   atmospheric pressure. The introduction of methane during biomass
   pyrolysis not only increased the yield of the collected oil from 6.79 to
   7.48 wt \% but also improved its quality in terms of higher H/C ratio,
   from 1.21 to 1.71, under the facilitation of Ag/ZSM-5 catalyst. A
   synergistic effect was clearly observed among methane, biomass
   pyrolysis, and catalyst, which contributed to the exciting performance.
   This novel process can be extended to the conversion of coals, other
   biomass, and heavy oil to more valuable products.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a lead zirconate titanate {[}PZT; Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O-3]
   microdiaphragm resonating sensor packaged in a polydimethylsiloxane
   chip. The proposed sensor can measure the density and viscosity of a
   liquid that is within the density and viscosity regime of blood (1.060 x
   10(3) kg/m(3), 3-4 cP). To verify the basic characteristics of the
   sensor, viscous solutions were prepared from glycerol and deionized
   water with a density in the range from 0.998 to 1.263 x 10(3) kg/m(3)
   and a viscosity in the range from 1 to 1414 cP. We measured the
   frequency responses of the sensor before and after injecting the
   viscosity-and density-controlled liquid under the bottom of the
   microdiaphragm. The resonant frequencies in the (1,1) and (2,2) modes
   decreased linearly as a function of the liquid density in the range from
   0.998 to 1.146 x 10(3) kg/m(3) with a sensitivity of 28.03 Hz/kg.m(-3)
   and 81.85 Hz/kg.m(-3), respectively. The full width at half maximum had
   a logarithmic relationship with the liquid viscosity in the viscosity
   range from 1 to 8.4 cP. The quality factor (Q-factor) for the 50\%
   glycerol/water mixture was determined to be greater than 20 for both the
   (1,1) and the (2,2) modes, indicating that the microdiaphragm resonating
   sensor is suitable for measuring the density and viscosity of a liquid
   within a density range from 0.998 to 1.1466 x 10 3 kg/m(3) and a
   viscosity range from 1 to 8.4 cP. These density and viscosity ranges
   span the regime of possible changes of blood characteristics. The
   microdiaphragm resonating sensors were also tested with a real human
   serum to verify that the sensor is suitable for measuring the viscosity
   and density of blood. Therefore, the PZT microdiaphragm resonating
   sensor could be utilized for early diagnosis of diseases associated with
   changes in the physical properties of blood. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{In this work, CO2 capture and H-2 production during the steam
   gasification of coal integrated with CO2 capture sorbent were
   investigated using a horizontal fixed bed reactor at atmospheric
   pressure. Four different temperatures (650, 675, 700, and 750 degrees C)
   and three sorbent-to-carbon ratios ({[}Ca]/{[}C] = 0, 1, 2) were
   studied. In the absence of sorbent, the maximum molar fraction of H-2
   (64.6\%) and conversion of coal (71.3\%) were exhibited at the highest
   temperature (750 degrees C). The experimental results verified that the
   presence of sorbent in the steam gasification of coal enhanced the molar
   fraction of H-2 to more than 80\%, with almost all CO2 was fixed into
   the sorbent structure, and carbon monoxide (CO) was converted to H-2 and
   CO2 through the water gas shift reaction. The steam gasification of coal
   integrated with CO2 capture largely depended on the reaction temperature
   and exhibited optimal conditions at 675 degrees C. The maximum molar
   fraction of H-2 (81.7\%) and minimum CO2 concentration (almost 0\%) were
   obtained at 675 degrees C and a sorbent-to-carbon ratio of 2. Copyright

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A number of methods have been proposed to evaluate well pair
   connectivity, including the Capacitance Model (CM). Since its
   development in 2006, numerous published reports using the CM (also
   called the Capacitance-Resistance Model) have appeared. Here, we take a
   closer look at the CM and evaluate its performance for evaluating
   interwell connectivity.
   The CM is a tool to analyze injection and production rate data for
   interwell connectivity. It is derived from a linear productivity model
   in the pseudo steady state regime for slightly compressible fluids.
   Therefore, we expect within a specific range of reservoir and fluid
   properties such as permeability, compressibility, viscosity, porosity,
   and number of wells per area, the results are accurate and repeatable
   but these ranges have not hitherto been quantified. Furthermore, there
   is a statistical side of CM performance involving the number of sampling
   data, sampling interval, and amount of noise which affects the accuracy
   of the results. Before applying the CM on field data, a sensitivity
   analysis on the accuracy of the expected results is desirable.
   We carried out a sensitivity analysis on the listed parameters by
   changing each of them and keeping the others constant during
   simulations. From the analysis, we define a dimensionless number, the CM
   number (C), to specify a range in which we can apply the CM with
   accurate and repeatable results (0.3 < C < 10). However, we may not have
   some of the information needed to evaluate C while working on field
   data. To solve the problem, we applied the bootstrap to evaluate the
   uncertainty and provide unbiased estimates and find that 50 iterations
   are sufficient to evaluate CM results accuracy. Finally, by calculating
   C and L (the ratio of number of samples to the number of model
   parameters) from the available information, we estimated the uncertainty
   of evaluation for 11 published field cases.
   The findings in this work not only help us to estimate the accuracy of
   the CM before applying it to field data, but also assist the CM users to
   assess uncertainties of the results and understand the effects of noise
   and number of measurements after applying the model. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {{Interwell connectivity evaluation in cases of changing skin and frequent

Abstract = {{Evaluating interwell connectivities can provide important information
   for reservoir management by identifying flow conduits, barriers, and
   injection imbalances. Injection and production rates, in ideal
   conditions, contain connectivity information. A number of methods have
   been proposed to predict connectivity based on these data.
   Unfortunately, many of these rate based methods have not proven to be as
   successful as intended because of factors external to the reservoir.
   Field maintenance procedures, such as shut-ins and work-overs, cause
   production rate changes which are not caused by injection rate
   fluctuations but which mislead connectivity estimators. We have
   developed a method which is tolerant to changes caused by external
   factors.
   This method, called the Multiwell Compensated Capacitance Model (MCCM),
   is based on the superposition principle. It can analyze injection and
   production data when producers' skin factors change, new producers are
   added, or active producers are shut-in. The MCCM also deals with another
   common problem in field data, which is when there are frequent producer
   shut-ins within sampling intervals (mini-shut-ins). For example, a
   producer is shut-in for a few days when flow rates are measured every
   month. By deriving the MCCM equations using average rates, we have
   developed an efficient approach to overcome this problem.
   In several synthetic cases with varying skin, long term shut-ins, and
   frequent mini-shut-ins, the MCCM successfully determined the true
   connectivity parameters and predicted the production rates accurately.
   For a set of field data from a heavy oil waterflood in Saskatchewan, we
   could improve the R-2 of the predicted rates by 20-35\% compared to
   another method and observed good agreement with geological information.
   In general, we may not find a long enough time interval of injection and
   production data where the producers' conditions stay constant. Applying
   earlier methods in such cases may give misleading connectivity results
   and inaccurate rate predictions. Adopting the approaches described in
   this paper helps geoscientists and engineers to have a better
   understanding of reservoir heterogeneity and its effects on fluid flow
   in the reservoir. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an error variation ranking (EVR)-based pruning
   method to reduce the complexity of memory polynomials (MPs) for power
   amplifier behavioral modeling. During the EVR pruning, the variation of
   prediction error caused by removing each term is calculated and ranked
   as a quantification factor to show the term's importance. The dominant
   terms are then selected based on their ranking positions among all
   terms. This method is verified by comparing its results with all other
   possible selections under the same conditions. When it is used to prune
   digital predistorters, approximately 74\% of the terms in the MP model
   and 78\% of the terms in the 2-D digital-predistortion model can be
   removed with negligible deterioration of the prediction and
   linearization performance. Moreover, further discussion is presented to
   strategize the configuration of MP models based on the EVR pruning

Title = {{Quantification of the Changes in the Openness of the Major Temporal

Journal = {{INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY \& VISUAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{55}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. We tested the hypothesis that the openness of the major
   temporal arcade (MTA) changes in the presence of plus disease, by
   quantification via parabolic modeling of the MTA, as well as measurement
   of an arcade angle for comparative analysis. Such analysis could assist
   in the detection and treatment of progressive retinopathy of
   prematurity.
   METHODS. Digital image processing techniques were applied for the
   detection and modeling of the MTA via a graphical user interface (GUI)
   to quantify the openness of the MTA. An arcade angle measure, based on a
   previously proposed method, also was obtained via the GUI for
   comparative analysis. The statistical significance of the differences
   between the plus and no-plus cases for each parameter was analyzed using
   the P value. The area (A(z)) under the receiver operating characteristic
   curve was used to assess the diagnostic performance of each feature.
   RESULTS. The temporal arcade angle measure and the openness parameter of
   the parabolic model were used to perform discrimination of plus versus
   no-plus cases. Using a set of 19 cases with plus and 91 with no plus
   disease, A(z) = 0.70 was obtained using the results of dual-parabolic
   modeling in screening for plus disease. The arcade angle measure
   provided comparable results with A(z) = 0.73.
   CONCLUSIONS. Using our proposed image analysis techniques and software,
   this study demonstrates, for the first time to our knowledge, that the
   openness of the MTA decreases in the presence of plus disease.}},

Abstract = {{This work details a technique for the in situ preparation of alumina
   nanoparticles in heavy oil and explores their activity with respect to
   mild thermal cracking. In principle, in situ-prepared nanoparticles
   display a high level of dispersion, which should improve their catalytic
   activity. Dispersed alumina nanoparticles 17 +/- 5 nm in mean diameter
   were successfully prepared at 300 degrees C and characterized using
   X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and
   energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The thermal cracking experiments
   were conducted in a batch reactor setup under two stages of heating at
   300 and 350 degrees C. The pressure buildup in the reactor and the
   viscosity and API gravity of the resultant oil were taken as measures of
   the extent of thermal cracking. Although there was a general shift
   toward higher degrees API gravity, it still fell within the level of
   uncertainty probably due to agglomeration at 350 degrees C that limited
   nanoparticle activity. A higher viscosity was obtained for the liquid
   fraction because of cross-linking. Furthermore, the uptake of
   hydrocarbon by the in situ-prepared nanoparticles was compared with that
   of commercial alumina nanoparticles. Uptake values with and without
   n-heptane or dichloromethane washing suggest different adsorbed species
   on the two types of particles.}},

Abstract = {{Echo particle image velocimetry (Echo PIV) presents itself as an
   attractive in vivo flow quantification technique to traditional
   approaches. Promising results have been acquired; however, limited
   quantification and validation is available for post-stenotic flows. We
   focus here on the comprehensive evaluation of in vitro downstream
   stenotic flow quantified by Echo PIV and validated in relation to
   digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV). A Newtonian blood analog was
   circulated through a closed flow loop and quantified immediately
   downstream of a 50 \% axisymmetric blockage at two Reynolds numbers (Re)
   using time-averaged Echo PIV and DPIV. Centerline velocities were in
   good agreement at all Re; however, Echo PIV measurements presented with
   elevated standard deviation (SD) at all measurements points. SD was
   improved using increased line density (LD); however, frame rate or field
   of view (FOV) is compromised. Radial velocity profiles showed close
   agreement with DPIV with the largest disparity in the shear layer and
   near-wall recirculation. Downstream recirculation zones were resolved by
   Echo PIV at both Re; however, magnitude and spatial coverage was reduced
   compared to DPIV that coincided with reduced contrast agent penetration
   beyond the shear layer. Our findings support the use of increased LD at
   a cost to FOV and highlight reduced microbubble penetration beyond the
   shear layer. High local SD at near-wall measurements suggests that
   further refinement is required before proceeding to in vivo
   quantification studies of wall shear stress in complex flow
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{This work provides a method for the Finite Element implementation of a
   previously developed large deformation model for porous fibre-reinforced
   materials with statistically oriented fibres. The model, which includes
   a description of the elastic properties and the permeability, was
   implemented in the open source Finite Element package FEBio, and a
   number of different simulations were performed to verify the correctness
   and the robustness of the implementation. In a benchmark test, with
   statistical, anisotropic but homogenous fibre orientation, the
   simulations showed that the fluid flow along the dominant fibre
   direction is significantly larger than across the impermeable,
   reinforcing fibres, as suggested by previous experimental results and
   predicted by the theory. Furthermore, as an example of practical
   application, a realistic articular cartilage model, with statistical and
   depth-dependent fibre orientation was implemented, and an unconfined
   compression test was simulated. This could be regarded as the first
   full, realistic model of articular cartilage in which the effect of the

Journal = {{COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{106}},
Pages = {{28-35}},
Month = {{OCT-NOV}},
Abstract = {{In the majority of fatal snow avalanches, skiers and snowmobilers
   trigger the initial failure in a weak layer by applying load to the snow
   cover. Understanding how stresses from dynamic surface loads transmit
   through the snow cover can help people avoid situations where they can
   trigger avalanches. We build on previous studies that provided more
   qualitative statements to a quantitative analysis about how the snow
   cover affects stress transmission. We quantified the upper snow cover
   for the experiments according to a bridging index which is the uniform
   hand hardness index of a particular layer in the snow cover multiplied
   by the thickness of that layer. Capacitive sensors were used to measure
   peak stress below dynamic surface loads within the mountain snow cover.
   The sensors were used on 33 separate field days to collect over 1420
   measurements of loading by skiers and snowmobiles. In order to visualize
   this measured stress, static stress calculations for an elastic
   homogeneous 2D snow cover were calibrated to show measured stress values
   of loading caused by the passage of a snowmobile. The change in 2D shape
   and magnitude of the induced stress was plotted for three ``typical{''}
   snow cover structures. Relatively soft snow allowed the specific levels
   of dynamic stress to penetrate deeper into the snow cover, thus
   increasing the probability of initiating a failure in a weak layer.
   Whereas, supportive snow limited the depth that the dynamic stress
   penetrated by spreading it out laterally. The added stress was then
   related to localized slope stability using stability indices. Bridging
   index thresholds of 130 to 190 for skiers and 160 to 260 for snowmobiles
   yielded stability index values greater than 15. Due to the high
   variability in the stress measurements, bridging index values for 77
   skier-triggered avalanche slopes were computed and compared to the
   values found from the stability index analysis. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Increasingly complex space operations require novel advanced structural
   composites for reconfigurable spacecrafts to have excellent flexural
   strength in reconfiguration processing and orbital maneuvering.
   Functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are performed to
   fabricate the MWCNTs/carbon fiber/N, N'-4, 4'-bimaleimide diphenyl
   methane/diallylbisphenol A (MWCNTs/CF/BMI/DBA) composites. ANSYS
   analysis reveals that the requiring lowest flexural strength of the
   composites is 1,150 MPa to meet actual requirements. The flexural
   strength of the MWCNTs/CF/BMI/DBA composites with 1 wt\% functionalized
   MWCNTs can fully meet the actual use for reconfigurable spacecrafts. And
   the thermal stabilities of the MWCNTs/CF/BMI/DBA composites are
   increased with the increasing addition of MWCNTs. (C) 2014 Society of

Title = {{Characterization of full-length recombinant human Proteoglycan 4 as an
   ocular surface boundary lubricant}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL EYE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{127}},
Pages = {{14-19}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Proteoglycan 4 (PRG4, or lubricin) is a lubricating mucin-like
   glycoprotein recently discovered at the ocular surface, where it
   functions as a boundary lubricant and appears to play a protective role.
   Recent technological advances have enabled abundant expression of
   full-length recombinant human PRG4 (rhPRG4). The objectives of this
   study were to 1) biochemically characterize the gross structure and
   glycosylations of full-length rhPRG4, and 2) assess the ocular surface
   boundary lubricating ability of rhPRG4 at both human cornea-eyelid and
   human cornea-polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) biointerfaces. rhPRG4 expressed
   by a Chinese hamster ovary cell line was characterized and compared to
   native bovine PRG4 by SDS-PAGE western blotting, and protein identity
   was assessed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Human corneas were
   articulated against PDMS or human eyelids, at effective sliding
   velocities of 0.3-30 mm/s under physiological loads of similar to 15
   kPa, to assess and compare the ocular lubricating ability of rhPRG4 to
   PRG4. Samples were tested serially in PRG4, rhPRG4 (both 300 mu g/ml),
   then saline. Western blotting indicated that rhPRG4 had immunoreactivity
   at the appropriate apparent molecular weight, and possessed O-linked
   glycosylation consistent with that of PRG4. rhPRG4 protein identity was
   confirmed by MS/Ms. Both PRG4 and rhPRG4 significantly, and similarly,
   reduced friction compared to saline at both human cornea - PDMS and
   human cornea-eyelid biointerfaces. In conclusion, the rhPRG4 studied
   here demonstrated appropriate higher order structure, O-linked
   glycosylations, and ocular surface boundary lubricating. Purified rhPRG4
   may have clinical utility as a topical treatment of dry eye disease or
   contact lens biomaterial coating to promote more comfortable wear. (C)
