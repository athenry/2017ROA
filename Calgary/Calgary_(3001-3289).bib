Abstract = {{This article demonstrates the cooperative diversity improvement achieved
   using a 120-mu W active scatterer built in 130-nm CMOS technology. The
   low-power all-analog device acts as a repeater, or relay, for phase
   sweep amplify-and-forward cooperative transmission. The device relies on
   microwave reflection to amplify, dynamically phase modulate, and
   reradiate the incident signal. This reduces the duration of the fades
   experienced in the indoor radio channel and improves error correction
   code performance. Radio channel propagation measurements collected using
   the relay prototype clearly show the effect of the phase modulation on
   fading and system level simulations conducted using the propagation data
   show a fivefold increase in coverage area.}},

Abstract = {{Methods for volumetric monitoring of liquid gastroesophageal reflux
   (GER) are still lacking. The aim of this study was to develop an
   automated intraluminal measurement technique which allows ambulatory
   volumetric quantification of liquid GER utilizing a minimum-cost
   intraluminal ultrasonic probe. This probe consists of two 2 MHz
   ultrasonic crystals longitudinally assembled along a multi-channel
   intraluminal impedance (MII) catheter. The proposed probe was initially
   tested with tubular phantoms of different diameters. Measurements of the
   cross-sectional areas of the phantoms showed high correlation with the
   actual areas (R-2 = 0.99). Subsequently, two in-vivo human tests were
   performed. For each human test the catheter assembly was inserted
   transnasally and the ultrasonic probe was placed in the area of the
   lower esophageal sphincter. Multiple liquid swallows of different
   volumes were invoked using electrolyte drinks. Sectional luminal volume
   (SLV) in the esophagus between the two ultrasonic crystals was obtained.
   Results of the swallows demonstrated that measured SLVs correlated with
   the actual swallowed liquid volume. The ultrasonic probe was combined
   with a MII catheter to discriminate between antegrade and retrograde
   bolus transit. Increases of SLVs during liquid GER episodes could be
   utilized to evaluate GER volume in the vicinity of the ultrasonic probe.}},

Abstract = {{The fatigue performance of Reinforced Concrete (RC) beams strengthened
   using NSM CFRP rods was examined in this study. The testing matrix
   consisted of one un-strengthened beam and four beams strengthened using
   NSM CFRP rods prestressed to effective strain values of 0, 3260, 6899,
   and 9177 mu representing 0\%, 20.4\%, 43.1\%, and 57.4\% of the CFRP rod
   ultimate tensile strain, 1.6\%. All beams were tested in four-point
   bending under fatigue conditions representing in-service loading for 3
   million cycles at a frequency of 2 Hz. Upper and lower load limits were
   chosen to induce a stress range of 125 MPa in the tension steel during
   the first cycle. The fatigue results were compared with experimental
   test results of identical beams strengthened using prestressed NSM CFRP
   strips tested under identical fatigue conditions found elsewhere in
   literature. Test results showed that all strengthened beams experienced
   deflection increase lower than that of the un-strengthened beam which
   indicates the efficiency of the strengthening process in reducing the
   damage accumulation. Also, the percentage deflection increase as well as
   the stiffness degradation after 3 million cycles are almost the same for
   all the strengthened beams which indicates that damage accumulation is
   independent from the prestress level. The groove dimensionality, rather
   than the CFRP geometry, has a detrimental effect on the bond behavior.

Title = {{Skim milk powder enhances trabecular bone architecture compared with

Journal = {{NUTRITION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{331-335}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Objective: We previously showed that skim milk powder (SMP) prevents
   weight gain more so than casein or whey alone. Dairy foods and changes
   in body mass can affect bone architecture; therefore, our objective was
   to examine the effect of dairy proteins on bone structure in the tibia
   of dietary-induced obese rats.
   Methods: Twelve-week-old diet-induced obese Sprague-Dawley rats were
   randomized to one of six diets that varied in protein source (casein,
   whey, or SMP), Ca level (0.67\% or 2.4\%), and energy density
   (high-fat/high-sucrose {[}HFHS], or normal energy density {[}NE]). After
   8 wk, body composition was assessed via dual energy x-ray absorptiometry
   and trabecular and cortical bone parameters of the tibia were assessed
   using micro-computed tomography and mixed model analysis.
   Results: Rats fed SMP with 2.4\% calcium had significantly lower body
   mass and fat mass than all other groups. The ratio of bone volume to
   total volume (BV/TV) was significantly higher when the HFHS diet was
   supplemented with SMP and 2.4\% calcium compared with whey (+66.7\%) or
   casein (+32.6\%). The HMS diet group had 49.3\% greater BV/TV compared
   with the NE groups. Increasing the amount of calcium resulted in a
   significant increase in BV/TV (188.9\%) in the HFHS diet groups but not
   in the NE groups.
   Conclusion: The intake of skim milk powder supplemented with calcium
   enhances trabecular bone architecture in obese rats consuming HFHS diet
   to a greater extent than with either casein or whey protein alone.
   Bioactive ingredients in complete dairy may contribute to these effects.

Abstract = {{This paper presents an adaptive neural network (NN) approach for the
   behavioral modeling of wireless transmitters exhibiting dynamic
   nonlinearities that are mainly caused by the power amplifier (PA). The
   proposed distributed spatiotemporal NN mimics the functionality of the
   mammal cerebellum, which is capable of very fast learning and contains
   features of interpolation. PAs' memory effects are modeled by using
   linear affine projection on a local function generated by preceding
   signal inputs. The applicability of the proposed model is validated in
   the frequency and time domains for forward and reverse modeling using a
   highly nonlinear Doherty amplifier and a class AB PA driven by wideband
   code division multiple access and WiMAX signals. The modeling
   performance is compared with existing techniques to establish it as a
   successful model that requires a relatively less demanding processing
   speed and memory requirement during the identification procedure. This
   model was found to be effective for adaptive applications such as
   baseband predistortion-based linearization of wireless transmitters.}},

Abstract = {{Permeability is the most important parameter for characterizing fluid
   flow though porous media and determined experimentally using a gas or
   liquid. For most porous materials the values of permeability determined
   with gas and liquid are the same. For tight rocks, however, the
   permeability obtained with liquid is much lower than that with gas. Such
   difference has been ascribed to uncertainties involved in the
   measurement, including the inaccuracy of the gas permeability
   extrapolated from Klinkenberg correlation, or the effects of liquid
   polarity and fine particle movements on liquid permeability when the
   liquid is present. In this paper, we report a noticeable difference
   between the gas and liquid permeability determined after all the above
   uncertainties are excluded by using a novel-designed experiment. The
   results show that the permeability of the same fluid varies as its state
   changes from gas to liquid in low-permeability porous media. This
   indicates that the gas behaves differently from liquid of the same fluid
   in low-permeability porous media. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{On the capabilities of the multi-channel singular spectrum method for
   extracting the main periodic and non-periodic variability from weekly
   GRACE data}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEODYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{54}},
Pages = {{64-78}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{We study the capabilities of the method of multi-channel singular
   spectrum analysis (MSSA) to extract periodic signals from the Gravity
   Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) gravity field solutions. As a
   non-parametric method and because of the data-adaptive nature of the
   base functions, the MSSA allows for modelling of non-periodic
   variations. In addition, it can identify modulated oscillations in the
   presence of noise. In our study, we analyze a complete 6-year weekly
   time series of the GFZ-produced GRACE spherical harmonic coefficients of
   degree and order 30. The MSSA filtering reduces the average
   root-mean-square (RMS) of the mass variability over the oceans by more
   than 60\% when all but the annual, semi-annual and long-term variations
   in the spherical harmonic coefficients are filtered out. While the high
   variance annual signal can be extracted from the GRACE data
   straightforwardly, the semi-annual and long-term modes identified in the
   low variance portion of the data eigen-spectrum are mixed. Moreover, the
   semi-annual variability is contaminated by the S2 tidal alias signal
   shown in an example for the Hudson Bay region to possibly alter the
   typical two-peak seasonal cycle of the water mass anomalies. Also, some
   long-term modes indicate that a variation exists with a 2.1-2.5 years
   period, possibly of a hydrology origin, which was found by previous
   studies in the GFZ GRACE data.
   On land, we analyze time series of basin averages in Amazon, Congo,
   Mississippi and Nelson rivers basins computed from the filtered GRACE
   and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS)/Noah model
   coefficients. The analysis is performed in two steps: (1) an
   approximation of the series of basin average is computed from the
   identified annual, semi-annual and long-term variations in the spherical
   harmonic coefficients and (2) to improve the approximation, the residual
   variability in the basin average series is analyzed by means of singular
   spectrum analysis. Time lags between the hydrology model and
   observations are found for the Amazon (4 weeks) and Mississippi and
   Nelson (2 weeks) basins, where GLDAS is generally ahead of GRACE.
   Significant differences in the water content for particular years, for
   example, during the 2007-2008 time period in Congo, are observed, as
   well.
   The use of the MSSA method in the analysis of the GRACE mass variations
   is not pertinent to the low resolution weekly solutions. The same
   approach can be applied to the monthly GRACE solutions of a much higher
   degree and order in the search for local signals. Here, we traded off
   the spatial resolution for the time resolution and we determined the
   time lag of the model water mass anomalies and observations with a
   nominal weekly resolution. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{People are not equally disabled by combined anterior cruciate ligament
   (ACL)/medial collateral ligament (MCL) injuries, nor do they all develop
   osteoarthritis (OA). Although biological/biomechanical causes are not
   clear, some association presumably exists between joint instability and
   OA development. We hypothesized that degree of OA development following
   standardized complete ACL/MCL injuries will vary directly with the
   degree of biomechanical abnormality between individuals. Three groups of
   sheep were used to test the hypothesis: 17 normal, 9 ACL/MCL transected,
   and 7 sham animals. Normal joints were assessed morphologically while
   sham and experimental animals had gait assessment pre- and at 4 and 20
   weeks post-surgery, with cartilage and bone changes being mapped and
   graded at sacrifice at 20 weeks. Sham joints were morphologically normal
   and had only one minor kinematic change at 20 weeks. Although variable,
   ACL/MCL deficient animals showed significant kinematic abnormalities in
   4/6 degrees of freedom (DOFs), as well as cartilage/bone damage by 20

Abstract = {{Changes in intracellular calcium (Ca2+) concentration, also known as
   Ca2+ signaling, have been widely studied in articular cartilage
   chondrocytes to investigate pathways of mechanotransduction. Various
   physical stimuli can generate an influx of Ca2+ into the cell, which in
   turn is thought to trigger a range of metabolic and signaling processes.
   In contrast to most studies, the approach used in this study allows for
   continuous real time recording of calcium signals in chondrocytes in
   their native environment. Therefore, interactions of cells with the
   extracellular matrix (ECM) are fully accounted for. Calcium signaling
   was quantified for dynamic loading conditions and at different
   temperatures. Peak magnitudes of calcium signals were greater and of
   shorter duration at 37 degrees C than at 21 degrees C. Furthermore, Ca2+
   signals were involved in a greater percentage of cells in the dynamic
   compared to the relaxation phases of loading. In contrast to the
   time-delayed signaling observed in isolated chondrocytes seeded in
   agarose gel, Ca2+ signaling in situ is virtually instantaneous in
   response to dynamic loading. These differences between in situ and in
   vitro cell signaling responses might provide crucial insight into the
   role of the ECM in providing pathways of mechanotransduction in the
   intact cartilage that are absent in isolated cells seeded in gel
   constructs. (C) 2011 Orthopaedic Research Society Published by Wiley

Abstract = {{A group of quantum dots can be designed to have a unique spectral
   emission by varying the size of the quantum dots (wavelength) and number
   of quantum dots (intensity). This technique has been previously proposed
   for biological tags and object identification. The potential of this
   system lies in the ability to have a large number of distinguishable
   wavelengths and intensity levels. This paper presents a communications
   system model for MxQDs including the interference between neighbouring
   QD colours and detector noise. An analytical model of the
   signal-to-noise ratio of a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) spectrometer is
   presented and confirmed with experimental results. We then apply a
   communications system perspective and propose data detection algorithms
   that increase the readability of the quantum dots tags. It is
   demonstrated that multiplexed quantum dot barcodes can be read with
   99.7\% accuracy using the proposed data detection algorithms in a system
   with 6 colours and 6 intensity values resulting in 46,655 unique

Journal = {{WEAR}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{276}},
Pages = {{141-148}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, the parametric effects, including the sand concentration,
   slurry flow velocity and impact angle, on erosion-corrosion (E-C) of X65
   steel in oil sands slurry were investigated using an impingement jet
   loop system by weight-loss test, polarization curve measurements and
   surface characterization. The mechanism of the steel E-C was determined.
   It was found that erosion components, including pure erosion and
   corrosion-enhanced erosion, are the dominant contributors to E-C of the
   steel, while the contribution of corrosion components is slight. With
   the increase of the sand concentration and slurry flow velocity, the E-C
   rate of the steel increases. However, an increasing impact angle would
   decrease the E-C rate of the steel in oil sands slurry. When the
   potential of the steel is relatively negative, erosion is dominant,
   especially at high flow velocities. At positive potentials, corrosion of
   steel is important in E-C process, especially at low flow velocities. An
   E-C map is built to illustrate mechanistically the E-C process depending
   on the steel potential and slurry flow velocity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

   in porous media}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{2, 2}},
Month = {{FEB 7}},
Abstract = {{The present study offers a paradigm on the stability of two-component
   miscible displacements in a homogeneous porous medium. The components
   have, in general, different mobility ratios, may diffuse at different
   rates, and are convected at different speeds. As a result, one of the
   components may lag behind the other. For the adopted transport models,
   it is found that the differences in the rates of diffusion and the lag
   between the two component fronts resulting from the differences in the
   speeds of convection can modify radically the instability
   characteristics. In particular, an unstable single-component
   displacement is always made more unstable by the presence of a second
   unfavorable component. The instability of the same flow is, on the other
   hand, attenuated by the presence of a favorable, less diffusive lagging
   component. However, this same flow instability can actually be enhanced
   when the favorable lagging second component is more diffusive.
   Furthermore, the larger the lag between the two components is, the more
   unstable the flow is when the lagging component is favorable to the
   displacement. An opposite trend is found when the the lagging component
   is unfavorable to the displacement. Finally, changes due to the lag
   between the two components fronts are stronger for a less diffusive
   lagging component and weaker for a more diffusive one. For illustration,
   these results are discussed in the special context of a thermal
   displacement where mass and heat are transported in the porous media.}},

Abstract = {{The human brain is the most complicated organ in the universe and is
   constantly the frontier yet to be explored in an interdisciplinary
   approach. Investigation into the natural and artificial brains and their
   cognitive mechanisms is a unique and hard problem in science that
   requires recursive and introspective mental power to explore the brain
   by the brain. This paper presents a cognitive informatics perspective on
   artificial brains. The behavioral models of artificial brains in the
   facets of abstract intelligence behaviors, cognitive behaviors, and
   computational intelligent behaviors are explored. A Reference Model of
   Artificial Brains (RMABs) is rigorously developed and elaborated using
   denotational mathematics, which reveals that the natural and artificial
   brains can be described by seven forms of intelligent behaviors at the
   imperative, autonomous, and cognitive layers from the bottom up. The
   theoretical framework of RMAB is described from the facets of cognitive
   informatics, neuroinformatics, computational intelligence, and
   denotational mathematics. The study and simulation of RMAB provide a
   foundation for the development of artificial brains, cognitive
   computers, and autonomous agent systems in neurocomputing, cognitive
   informatics, and computational intelligence.}},

Abstract = {{It is recently recognized that complex systems are not only
   characterized by their magnitudes, but also their lifespans. This paper
   presents a theory of Long-Lifespan systems (LLS's) and its applications
   in explaining the properties of complex systems from both the function
   and time dimensions. The mathematical models of LLS's such as those of
   the abstract systems, system magnitudes, and system lifespan, are
   established. Properties of LLS's, particularly those of system
   conservation, system equilibrium, and system self-organization, are
   formally analyzed. The fundamental mechanisms and applications of LLS's
   in economics are elaborated, followed by the description of the global
   warning and the greenhouse effect in order to explain the rational
   causality of global climate system as a typical LLS system.}},

Title = {{Impact of intraformational water zones on SAGD performance}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{82-83}},
Pages = {{187-197}},
Month = {{FEB-MAR}},
Abstract = {{Approximately 80\% of the 173 billion barrels of recoverable crude
   bitumen in the Athabasca oil sands require in-situ recovery due to the
   depth of burial. Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) has become the
   preferred in situ recovery process for producing Athabasca oil sands
   reservoirs. It is well known that oil sands reservoirs are heterogeneous
   with respect to porosity, permeability, phase saturations, and fluid
   composition. A large-scale heterogeneity that has been encountered in
   SAGD operations is top and bottom water thief zones. However, evidence
   of intraformational water zones has also been found: seismic, log, and
   core analysis suggest that these water zones can exist as both isolated
   pockets and extensive connected regions within the oil column. The
   effect of these high water saturation zones on the SAGD process is
   largely unexplored. In this research, detailed thermal reservoir
   simulation is used to study the movement of water during SAGD operations
   in reservoirs with several intraformational water zone configurations.
   The effect of water zone extent, connectivity, saturation and operating
   conditions on water movement and SAGD performance is examined. Fluid
   migration out of the reservoir is found to be relatively small, with
   `oil plugs' effectively sealing water zones in front of the growing
   steam chamber. However, water zones are found to have a significant
   effect on production. The inclusion of water channels led to an average
   drop in production of 73\% while water zones in the form of
   interconnected nodes led to a 12\% reduction. This indicates that the
   spatial distribution of water zones largely determines the effect on
   SAGD performance. The variation in production is the result of
   heterogeneous steam chamber growth that leaves large areas of the
   reservoir unswept. This appears to be largely due to the influence of
   water zones on near wellbore pressure distributions, particularly at
   early times. By acting as either `pressure sinks' or `pressure
   transmitters' water zones are able to both `seed' and suppress steam
   chamber growth. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a cardiac arrhythmia that highly increases
   the risk of stroke and is associated with significant but still
   unexplored changes in the mechanical behavior of the tissue. Planar
   biaxial tests were performed on tissue specimens from pigs at the
   healthy stage and after ventricular tachypacing (VTP), a procedure
   applied to reproduce the relevant features of AF. The local arrangement
   of the fiber bundles in the tissue was investigated on specimens from
   rabbit atria by means of circularly polarized light. Based on this,
   mechanical data were fitted to two anisotropic constitutive
   relationships, including a four-parameter Fung-type model and a
   microstructurally-motivated model. Accounting for the fiber-induced
   anisotropy brought average R-2 = 0.807 for the
   microstructurally-motivated model and average R-2 = 0.949 for the Fung
   model. Validation of the fitted constitutive relationships was performed
   by means of FEM simulations coupled to FORTRAN routines. The
   performances of the two material models in predicting the second
   Piola-Kirchhoff stress were comparable, with average errors < 3.1\%.
   However, the Fung model outperformed the other in the prediction of the
   Green-Lagrange strain, with 9.2\% maximum average error. To increase
   model generality, a proper averaging procedure accounting for
   nonlinearities was used to obtain average material parameters. In
   general, a stiffer behavior after VTP was noted. {[}DOI:

Title = {{Partial Meniscectomy Changes Fluid Pressurization in Articular Cartilage
   in Human Knees}},

Volume = {{134}},

Abstract = {{Partial meniscectomy is believed to change the biomechanics of the knee
   joint through alterations in the contact of articular cartilages and
   menisci. Although fluid pressure plays an important role in the load
   support mechanism of the knee, the fluid pressurization in the
   cartilages and menisci has been ignored in the finite element studies of
   the mechanics of meniscectomy. In the present study, a 3D
   fibril-reinforced poromechanical model of the knee joint was used to
   explore the fluid flow dependent changes in articular cartilage
   following partial medial and lateral meniscectomies. Six partial
   longitudinal meniscectomies were considered under relaxation, simple
   creep, and combined creep loading conditions. In comparison to the
   intact knee, partial meniscectomy not only caused a substantial increase
   in the maximum fluid pressure but also shifted the location of this
   pressure in the femoral cartilage. Furthermore, these changes were
   positively correlated to the size of meniscal resection. While in the
   intact joint, the location of the maximum fluid pressure was dependent
   on the loading conditions, in the meniscectomized joint the location was
   predominantly determined by the site of meniscal resection. The partial
   meniscectomy also reduced the rate of the pressure dissipation,
   resulting in even larger difference between creep and relaxation times
   as compared to the case of the intact knee. The knee joint became
   stiffer after meniscectomy because of higher fluid pressure at knee
   compression followed by slower pressure dissipation. The present study
   indicated the role of fluid pressurization in the altered mechanics of
   meniscectomized knees. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4005764]}},

Abstract = {{Ignoring the temporal correlations present within global navigation
   satellite systems (GNSS) observations can result in too much confidence
   being placed in the estimated positions. Temporally correlated errors
   occur when the magnitude of an error is similar over time. Treating
   temporally correlated GNSS errors as independent results in an overly
   optimistic variance-covariance (VCV) matrix, potentially resulting in an
   incorrect fix of the ambiguities and an overly optimistic estimated
   accuracy of the estimated positions. Unlike spatially correlated errors,
   temporally correlated errors are not mitigated or properly dealt with
   within most of today's real-time kinematic (RTK) software. This paper
   reviews the theory of temporal correlations as well as previously
   developed solutions for obtaining more realistic position accuracies. A
   simulation is developed demonstrating the impact of neglecting temporal
   correlation. Using real data from five baselines up to 10 km in length,
   this paper then determines how long the L1 carrier phase observations
   remain correlated. By using the autocorrelation of the phase residuals,
   the L1 phase measurements are shown to be correlated for an average of
   115 s. The length of temporal correlation varies according to receiver
   environment and satellite elevation angle. Trends in correlation time
   according to baseline length are also studied. DOI:

   of sample size}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& GEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Pages = {{64-76}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Porosity and permeability are key petrophysical parameters obtained from
   laboratory core analysis. Cores, obtained from drilled wells, are often
   few in number for most oil and gas fields. Porosity and permeability
   correlations based on conventional techniques such as linear regression
   or neural networks trained with core and geophysical logs suffer poor
   generalization to wells with only geophysical logs. The generalization
   problem of correlation models often becomes pronounced when the training
   sample size is small. This is attributed to the underlying assumption
   that conventional techniques employing the empirical risk minimization
   (ERM) inductive principle converge asymptotically to the true risk
   values as the number of samples increases. In small sample size
   estimation problems, the available training samples must span the
   complexity of the parameter space so that the model is able both to
   match the available training samples reasonably well and to generalize
   to new data. This is achieved using the structural risk minimization
   (SRM) inductive principle by matching the capability of the model to the
   available training data. One method that uses SRM is support vector
   regression (SVR) network. In this research, the capability of SVR to
   predict porosity and permeability in a heterogeneous sandstone reservoir
   under the effect of small sample size is evaluated. Particularly, the
   impact of Vapnik's epsilon-insensitivity loss function and least-modulus
   loss function on generalization performance was empirically
   investigated. The results are compared to the multilayer perception
   (MLP) neural network, a widely used regression method, which operates
   under the ERM principle. The mean square error and correlation
   coefficients were used to measure the quality of predictions. The
   results demonstrate that SVR yields consistently better predictions of
   the porosity and permeability with small sample size than the MLP
   method. Also, the performance of SVR depends on both kernel function
   type and loss functions used. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The influence of pyrolysis temperature and residence time on the char
   yields and resultant char characteristics were investigated in the
   isothermal pyrolysis of flax straw. The pyrolysis temperature was varied
   in the range between 300 and 500 degrees C and reaction residence time
   was varied from 15 to 60 mm. The char yield was found to decrease with
   both increasing pyrolysis temperature and residence time. The char
   structure and physical characteristics were thoroughly investigated by
   means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO)
   and N-2 physisorption techniques. The results show that the degree of
   porosity and graphitization increased with increasing pyrolysis
   temperature and time. TPO studies on the char samples corroborate well
   with the XRD findings and showed the presence of two types of carbon;
   namely, amorphous filamentous carbon and crystalline graphitic carbon.
   Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the char was performed to understand
   the combustion kinetics and reactivity. Chars formed at lower pyrolysis
   temperatures were found to be more reactive than the chars produced at
   higher pyrolysis temperatures, and these findings are well supported by
   the TPO, TGA, N-2 physisorption and XRD characterization data.
   Furthermore, an empirical global kinetic model was devised based on
   power law and used to estimate the activation energy and other kinetic
   parameters of both flax straw pyrolysis and char combustion processes.

Abstract = {{Metallic heteroatoms deactivate expensive catalyst and, thus, should be
   removed at early stages during crude oil processing. Electro- and
   biological demetallization are examples of two emerging techniques which
   remove the metallic heteroatoms mainly nickel and vanadium into ions or
   ionic complexes ultimately residing in the aqueous phase of a two-phase
   water/oil system. This work investigates the conversion of the aqueous
   metallic species into metal oxide nanoparticles, which are effective
   upgrading catalysts, dispersed in the oil phase. The conversion step
   commenced in situ within a water-in-oil emulsion structure, and the
   resultant nanoparticles remain very well dispersed in the heavy oil
   phase. The product nanoparticles were characterized, after successful
   collection from the oil phase, using X-ray diffraction (XRD),
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy dispersive X-ray

   with mean sizes of 20 and 15 nm, respectively. Some aggregates have,
   nevertheless, formed, due to the relatively high temperature requirement

Abstract = {{Hydraulically fractured vertical and horizontal wells completed in shale
   gas and some tight gas plays are known to exhibit long periods of linear
   flow. Recently, techniques for analyzing this flow period using
   (normalized) production data have been put forth, but there are known
   errors associated with the analysis. In this paper, linear flow from
   fractured wells completed in tight/shale gas reservoirs subject to a
   constant-production-rate constraint is studied. We show analytically
   that the square-root-of-time plot (a plot of rate-normalized pressure
   vs. square root of time that is commonly used to interpret linear flow)
   depends on the production rate. We also show that depending on
   production rate, the square-root-of-time plot may not be a straight line
   during linear flow; the higher the production rate, the earlier in time
   the plot deviates from the expected straight line. This deviation
   creates error in the analysis, especially for flow-regime
   identification. To address this issue, a new analytical method is
   developed for analyzing linear-flow data for the constant-gas-rate
   production constraint. The method is then validated using a number of
   numerically simulated cases. As expected, on the basis of the analytical
   derivation, the square-root-of-time plots for these cases depend on
   gas-production rate and, for some cases, the plot does not appear as a
   straight line during linear flow. Finally, we found that there is
   excellent agreement between the fracture half-lengths obtained using
   this method and the input fracture half-lengths entered in to numerical
   simulation.}},

Abstract = {{With the increasing concern about climate change, the public, industry,
   and government are showing increased interest toward reducing carbon
   dioxide (CO2) emissions. Geological storage of CO2 is perceived to be
   one of the most promising methods to provide significant reduction in
   CO2 emissions over the short and medium term. However, one major concern
   regarding geological storage of CO2 is the possibility of leakage. CO2
   under the pressure and temperature conditions encountered in most
   geological settings remains more buoyant than water. Processes that
   could lead to permanent trapping of CO2 include geochemical reactions,
   with the formation of solid minerals. This trapping mechanism is
   attractive because it converts the CO2 into a solid compound. However,
   the time scale of such reactions is perceived to be centuries to
   millennia. In contrast, the kinetics of CO2-hydrate formation leading to
   trapping of CO2 in the solid form is quite fast, providing the
   opportunity for long-term storage of CO2. In this paper, geological
   settings suitable for formation of CO2 hydrate are investigated. We
   study storage of CO2 in depleted gas pools of northern Alberta.
   Thermodynamic calculations suggest that CO2 hydrate is stable at
   temperatures that occur in a number of formations in northern Alberta,
   in an area where significant CO2 emissions are associated with
   production of oil sands and bitumen. Simulation results presented in
   this paper suggest that, upon CO2 injection into such depleted gas
   reservoirs, pressure would initially rise until conditions are
   appropriate for hydrate formation, enabling storage of large volumes of
   CO2 in solid form. Numerical-simulation results suggest that, because of
   tight packing of CO2 molecules in the solid (hydrate), the CO2 storage
   capacity of these pools is many times greater than their
   initial-gas-in-place capacity. This provides a local option for storage
   of a portion of the CO2 emissions there.
   In this paper, we study the storage capacity of such depleted gas pools
   and examine the effect of various reservoir properties and operating
   conditions thereon. In particular, we study the effect of the in-situ
   gas in formation of mixed-gas hydrates; the effect of rise in
   temperature as a result of the exothermic reaction of hydrate formation;
   the effect of initial reservoir pressure, temperature, and porosity; and
   conditions for avoiding the deleterious formation of hydrate around the
   wellbore.}},

Abstract = {{Background-The direct role of coronary vessels in defibrillation,
   although hypothesized to be important, remains to be elucidated. We
   investigated how vessel-induced virtual electrode polarizations assist
   reentry termination.
   Methods and Results-A highly anatomically detailed rabbit ventricular
   slice bidomain computer model was constructed from 25-mu m magnetic
   resonance data, faithfully representing both structural and electric
   properties of blood vessels. For comparison, an equivalent simplified
   model with intramural cavities filled in was also built. Following
   fibrillation induction, 6 initial states were selected, and biphasic
   shocks (5-70 V) were applied using a realistic implanted
   cardioverter-defibrillator electrode configuration. A fundamental
   mechanism of biphasic defibrillation was uncovered in both models,
   involving successive break excitations (after each shock phase)
   emanating from opposing myocardial surfaces (in septum and left
   ventricle), which rapidly closed down excitable gaps. The presence of
   vessels accelerated this process, achieving more-rapid and successful
   defibrillation. Defibrillation failed in 5 cases (all because of
   initiation of new activity) compared with 8 with the simplified model
   (5/8 failures because of surviving activity). At stronger shocks,
   virtual electrodes formed around vessels, rapidly activating intramural
   tissue because of break excitations, assisting the main defibrillation
   mechanism, and eliminating all activity <15 ms of shock end in 60\% of
   successful shocks (36\% in simplified model). Subsequent analysis
   identified that only vessels >200 mu m in diameter participated through
   this mechanism. Consequently, wavefronts could survive intramurally in
   the simplified model, leading to reentry and shock failure.
   Conclusions-We provide new insight into defibrillation mechanisms by
   showing how intramural blood vessels facilitate more-effective
   elimination of existing wavefronts, rapid closing down of excitable
   gaps, and successful defibrillation and give guidance toward the
   required resolution of cardiac imaging and model generation endeavors
   for mechanistic defibrillation analysis. (Circ Arrhythm Electrophysiol.

Abstract = {{Tight gas reservoirs are notoriously difficult to characterize; routine
   methods developed for conventional reservoirs are not appropriate for
   tight gas reservoirs. In this article, we investigate the use of
   nonroutine methods to characterize permeability heterogeneity and pore
   structure of a tight gas reservoir for use in flow-unit identification.
   Profile permeability is used to characterize fine-scale (<1 in. {[}<2.5
   cm]) vertical heterogeneity in a tight gas core; more than 500
   measurements were made. Profile permeability, although useful for
   characterizing heterogeneity, will not provide in-situ estimates of
   permeability; furthermore, the scale of measurement is much smaller than
   log scale. Pulse-decay permeability measurements collected on core plugs
   under confining pressure were used to correct the profile permeability
   measurements to in-situ stress conditions, and 13-point averages of
   profile permeability were used to relate to log-derived porosity
   measurements. Finally, N-2 adsorption, a new method for tight gas was
   used to estimate the pore-size distribution of several tight gas
   samples. A unimodal or bimodal distribution was observed for the
   samples, with the larger peak corresponding to the dominant pore-throat
   size, as confirmed by independent methods. Furthermore, the
   adsorption-desorption hysteresis loop shape was used to interpret the
   dominant pore shape as slot-shaped pores, which is typical of many tight
   gas reservoirs. The N-2 adsorption method provides rapid analysis and
   does not suffer from some of the same limitations of Hg injection. In
   the future, we hope that the N-2 adsorption method may prove useful for
   flow-unit characterization (based on dominant pore size) of fine-grained
   (siltstone-shale) tight gas reservoirs.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new reference symbol (RS) mapping scheme for the
   Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) long-term evolution (LTE)
   and LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) downlink is proposed to improve channel
   estimation performance in high-mobility communication scenarios. The
   proposed scheme employs null subcarriers to guard RSs, which helps
   mitigate the effect of intercarrier interference (ICI) on subcarriers
   carrying RSs. Additionally, the proposed scheme allows the ICI gain
   parameters to be estimated via a simple frequency-domain estimator.
   Modified Cramer-Rao bound (MCRB) expressions are derived for the
   proposed scheme, as well as for the conventional RS mapping scheme
   defined in the 3GPP LTE and LTE-A standards to compare their performance
   at high mobile user speeds. These bounds, together with mean square
   errors obtained from simulations, reveal superior performance achieved
   by the proposed scheme in high-mobility scenarios. Additionally, at high

Abstract = {{Pedestrian heading estimation is a fundamental challenge in Global
   Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments. Additionally,
   the heading observability considerably degrades in low-speed mode of
   operation (e.g. walking), making this problem even more challenging. The
   goal of this work is to improve the heading solution when hand-held
   personal/portable devices, such as cell phones, are used for positioning
   and to improve the heading estimation in GNSS-denied signal
   environments. Most smart phones are now equipped with self-contained,
   low cost, small size and power-efficient sensors, such as magnetometers,
   gyroscopes and accelerometers. A magnetometer needs calibration before
   it can be properly employed for navigation purposes. Magnetometers play
   an important role in absolute heading estimation and are embedded in
   many smart phones. Before the users navigate with the phone, a
   calibration is invoked to ensure an improved signal quality. This signal
   is used later in the heading estimation. In most of the
   magnetometer-calibration approaches, the motion modes are seldom
   described to achieve a robust calibration. Also, suitable calibration
   approaches fail to discuss the stopping criteria for calibration. In
   this paper, the following three topics are discussed in detail that are
   important to achieve proper magnetometer-calibration results and in turn
   the most robust heading solution for the user while taking care of the
   device misalignment with respect to the user: (a) game-theoretic
   concepts to attain better filter parameter tuning and robustness in
   noise uncertainty, (b) best maneuvers with focus on 3D and 2D motion
   modes and related challenges and (c) investigation of the calibration
   termination criteria leveraging the calibration robustness and

Abstract = {{We propose a numerical ray-tracing algorithm for isotropic media
   discretized by finite elements. This algorithm, which is based on
   tetrahedral elements, combines the flexibility of finite-element
   modelling with the calculation of rays through a three-dimensional (3D)
   speed field, given a direction of a ray at its initial point. We
   implement this algorithm and investigate the sensitivity of rays
   (namely, their shape and the signal travel time along them) to (i)
   deformations of the medium and subsequent changes of its speed field and
   (ii) perturbations of initial direction in the presence of first- and
   second-order discontinuities. We consider several scenarios
   analytically, and use them to verify the finite-element scheme. The
   ray-tracing scheme accounts for Snell's law at interfaces of velocity
   discontinuities and intrinsically handles discontinuous velocity
   gradients. It accommodates objects of arbitrary 3D shape and arbitrary
   speed fields. Furthermore, this finite-element technique accounts for
   deformations of a discretized medium on the level of each node by moving
   the node location and associated value of velocity. For several
   numerical experiments, we deform different models to observe deviations
   of rays from their initial shape. This study shows how the computation
   of rays can be combined with finite-element calculations of static

Abstract = {{This study provides a comprehensive theoretical analysis of a modified
   maximum likelihood signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimator and quantifies
   the minimum coherent integration time required to achieve a predefined
   level of accuracy. The SNR estimator is derived under the assumptions of
   perfect frequency synchronisation, data bit aiding and constant signal
   phase during the observation window. The probability density function
   (pdf) of the SNR estimator in logarithmic units is derived and used to
   quantify the bias and error bounds associated with the considered SNR
   estimator. The minimum coherent integration time is determined by
   requiring a desired level of accuracy with a given probability level,
   that is the integration time is chosen in order to make the SNR estimate
   lie in a predefined confidence interval. Theoretical results have been
   validated using GNSS software and hardware simulations. The agreement
   between theoretical and experimental results supports the validity of

Abstract = {{This paper investigates mechanistically stress corrosion cracking (SCC)
   of an X70 pipeline steel that is under cathodic protection (CP) in a

   potential range, i.e., -730 and -920 mV(SCE), where the steel is in a
   non-equilibrium electrochemical state, and anodic dissolution (AD)
   reaction may occur when the steel is polarized cathodically. When the
   applied potential is more positive than this range, SCC is AD-based;
   while the applied potential is more negative. SCC of pipelines is under
   hydrogen embrittlement (HE) mechanism. When the polarization potential
   is within the range. SCC of the steel is under the combined effect of AD
   and HE. Therefore, AD may still occur on pipeline steel that is under CP
   with the potential within this critical range, contributing to the

Abstract = {{The influence of spanwise flow on the development and stabilization of
   leading-edge vortices (LEVs) on a foil (without rotational acceleration)
   has been investigated. The plunging swept wing/fin geometry used in this
   study, characteristic of fish-like tails, has been found to be
   insufficient in the stabilization of LEVs. Direct force measurements and
   visualizations, including Particle Image Velocimetry and lead
   precipitation, show that despite the presence of a strong spanwise flow
   at higher sweepback angles, the vortex breaks off and convects
   downstream at the same relative time as found for low sweepback angles,
   which experience little spanwise contribution. Although the LEV
   stabilization is insensitive to bulk spanwise flow, the LEV and tip
   vortex have been observed to maintain a stronger connection with one
   another at higher sweepback angles. This result implies that despite
   similar forces developing for low and high sweepback angles alike, the
   resulting vortex-wake topologies can vary significantly from one
   another.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to determine the sex- and maturity-related
   differences in bone microstructure and estimated bone strength at the
   distal radius and distal tibia in children and adolescents. We used
   high-resolution pQCT to measure standard morphological parameters in
   addition to cortical porosity (Ct.Po) and estimated bone strength by
   finite element analysis. Participants ranged in age from 9 to 22 years
   (n=212 girls and n=186 boys) who were scanned annually for either one
   (11\%) or two (89\%) years at the radius and for one (15\%), two (39\%),
   or three (46\%) years at the tibia. Participants were grouped by the
   method of Tanner into prepubertal, early pubertal, peripubertal, and
   postpubertal groups. At the radius, peri- and postpubertal girls had
   higher cortical density (Ct.BMD; 9.4\% and 7.4\%, respectively) and
   lower Ct.Po (118\% and56\%, respectively) compared with peri- and
   postpubertal boys (all p<0.001). Peri- and postpubertal boys had higher
   trabecular bone volume ratios (p<0.001) and larger cortical
   cross-sectional areas (p<0.05, p<0.001) when compared with girls. Based
   upon the load-to-strength ratio (failure load/estimated fall force),
   boys had lower risk of fracture than girls at every stage except during
   early puberty. Trends at the tibia were similar to the radius with
   differences between boys and girls in Ct.Po (p<0.01) and failure load
   (p<0.01) at early puberty. Across pubertal groups, within sex, the most
   mature girls and boys had higher Ct.BMD and lower Ct.Po than their less
   mature peers (prepuberty) at both the radius and tibia. Girls in early,
   peri-, and postpubertal groups and boys in peri- and postpubertal groups
   had higher estimates of bone strength compared with their same-sex
   prepubertal peers (p<0.001). These results provide insight into the sex-
   and maturity-related differences in bone microstructure and estimated
   bone strength. (C) 2012 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the mechanistic modeling of micro end milling
   forces, with consideration of the effects of plowing, elastic recovery,
   effective rake angle, and flank face rubbing. Two different mechanistic
   models are developed for shearing- and plowing-dominant regimes. Micro
   end milling experiments are conducted to validate the model for Aluminum
   6061; and, the model appropriately predicts force profiles for a wide
   range of feed rates, and prediction of the root mean square (RMS) values
   of the resultant forces is, on average, within a 12\% error. The study
   of the model shows that plowing and rubbing force contributions are
   significant, especially at low feed rates. The edge radius is found to
   have a significant effect on plowing and rubbing force components and
   the effective rake angle, which indicates that it is important to
   maintain a low edge radius to reduce micro end milling forces. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{Fibrous filters are used widely in transfusion medicine to remove
   leukocytes (white cells) from platelet-rich plasma (PRP), which is a
   suspension of leukocytes and platelets in plasma (water and proteins).
   The interaction of injected leukocytes and platelets with fibers in a
   filter controls the effectiveness of the filter to selectively retain
   leukocytes and to allow platelets to pass through. We present
   comprehensive experimental results at three different spatial
   scales-cellular, pore, and macroscale-to study PRP filtration in fibrous
   filters. We used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to measure and compare
   adhesive forces of the cells brought in contact with clean and
   protein-coated materials. We then extended cellular-scale experiments to
   pore-scale flow systems using transparent microfluidic platforms (filter
   chip) to visualize cell movement in interstitial space and cell capture
   to microposts under precisely controlled laminar and low-Stokes'-number
   conditions. We tested filter chips with different surface wettabilities;
   at the macroscale, we used commercial PRP filters. AFM and filter-chip
   experiments revealed that plasma proteins play important roles in
   modifying surface properties to adhere incoming cells. Filter-chip and
   commercial-filter experimental results showed that adhesion of both
   leukocytes and platelets decreases at higher shear rates. This reduction
   was more pronounced for platelets than for leukocytes, which means that
   results can be used to optimize the selective filtration process.}},

Title = {{Early Heelstrike Kinetics Are Indicative of Slip Potential During
   Walking Over a Contaminated Surface}},
Journal = {{HUMAN FACTORS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{5-13}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The objective of this study is to examine ground kinetics
   early in stance while walking on a contaminated surface and assess the
   potential of kinetics to quantify risk of slipping.
   Background: Prior studies of slipping have dismissed early ground
   kinetic data, and therefore no prior literature has been able to assess
   the viability of using these data to quantify slip potential.
   Method: A total of 11 healthy male participants volunteered to walk over
   a force plate that was at random times contaminated with soap. Ground
   kinetics were measured by the force plate (2400 Hz), and heel
   displacement was quantified using high-speed video cameras (240 Hz) and
   retro-reflective markers.
   Results: The results indicated a significant reduction in shear force as
   early as 0.42 ms after heelstrike for contaminated trials, whereas for
   utilized coefficient of friction, a significant reduction was not seen
   until 11.34 ms. Heel displacements considered ``safe{''} in the
   literature (<30 mm) demonstrated proportionally different thresholds for
   shear force and utilized coefficient of friction.
   Conclusion: The authors suggest that shear force in early stance shows
   more promise in quantifying slip potential as compared to utilized
   coefficient of friction given that (a) significant differences are seen
   earlier in shear than utilized coefficient of friction and (b) the
   threshold for utilized coefficient of friction, over which heel
   displacement stabilized to a ``safe{''} value, exceeded values for
   utilized coefficient of friction that have been recommended as
   ``safe.{''}
   Application: These results have wide implications for standards related
   to the design and testing of interventions to prevent injuries because
   of slipping.}},

Abstract = {{The attenuation of Escherichia coli and total coliform from secondary
   treated wastewater effluent under two ``at-grade{''} effluent
   distribution systems was evaluated in a sandy silt vadose zone in a cold
   climate. The two at-grade distribution lines had different designs and
   hydraulic loading rates. Effluent transport was examined using chloride
   as a tracer. Coliform fate was evaluated relative to the chloride using
   a combination of in situ pore water sampling and destructive soil
   sampling, combined with the observation of a dye tracer along excavation
   sidewalls. Although bacteria attenuation in the subsoil appeared to
   decrease during colder, winter temperatures (likely due to decreased
   viability and decreased predation), the subsoil provided about a four
   log reduction in E. coli over 90 cm of vertical transport. Horizontal
   transport of bacteria (up to 1.5 m from the line) was likely aided by
   flow on top of a microbial biomat observed at the soil surface. Both the
   subsurface dye patterns and the E. coli sampling suggested less
   preferential flow occurred below the lower loading rate design. At-grade
   distribution of secondary treated wastewater appears to be a viable
   alternative to conventional distribution fields at sites with similar
   climate and soils.}},

Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},

Volume = {{125}},

Month = {{JAN 27}},
Abstract = {{Because uncertainty pervades the field of rock slope stability analysis,
   the importance of uncertainty has been recognized. Subsequently,
   probability theory has been used to quantify the uncertainty. However,
   some uncertainties, due to incomplete information, cannot be managed
   satisfactorily by probability theory, so fuzzy set theory is more
   appropriate in the case. In this study, the uncertain parameters in rock
   slope stability analysis were expressed as fuzzy numbers and fuzzy set
   theory was employed. The Monte Carlo simulation technique and
   reliability index approach were implemented with fuzzy set theory in
   order to take into account the fuzzy uncertainties in the evaluation of
   the probability of failure. In order to check the feasibility of the
   proposed approaches, the presented methods were applied to a practical
   example. Based on the results of the practical application, it was
   concluded that the application of fuzzy set theory shows consistent
   analysis results and can obtain reasonable results. (C) 2011 Elsevier

   and carbon monoxide (CO) yields and the carbon deposition percentage
   were investigated. In order to examine the effect of support, the
   results obtained on zirconia support were compared to the results
   obtained over nickel-based catalysts supported on alumina (Ni/Al2O3). It
   was found that the Ni/ZrO2 catalysts presented higher activity than
   those supported on alumina for hydrogen production. The CO yields
   obtained over Ni/ZrO2 catalysts were also higher than those obtained
   over Ni/Al2O3 catalysts. A potential H-2 yield of almost 80\% can be
   obtained at 850 degrees C using Ni/ZrO2 catalysts with a nickel content
   of 14\%; whereas, the H-2 yield was less when Ni/Al2O3 catalysts were
   employed. The amount of carbon deposited on each catalyst was measured.
   It was observed that the carbon depositions on the Ni/ZrO2 catalysts
   were extremely high. A comparison between the amounts of carbon
   deposited on the Ni/Al2O3 and Ni/ZrO2 catalysts revealed that the carbon
   deposition is strongly dependent on the type of support. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Pitting corrosion has been observed to occur on pipeline steels that are
   under cathodic protection (CP). In this work, the square wave
   polarization (SWP) technique and localized electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy measurements were combined to investigate the occurrence of
   pitting corrosion on a cathodically polarized X70 line pipe steel in a
   near-neutral pH solution. It was found that corrosion pits could
   generate on the steel under CP when it encounters a polarization
   fluctuation. A potential field is generated locally at defects on the
   steel to result in an electrochemical state conversion, i.e., the
   cathodic polarized state changing instantly to an anodic polarization.
   It was proposed that, for pipelines under CP, the generation of pits is
   highly possible due to the frequent fluctuations of the CP
   current/potential. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Solitonlike propagating modes have been proposed for excitable tissue,
   but have never been measured in cardiac tissue. In this study, we
   simulate an experimental protocol to elicit these propagating unstable
   wavelets (PUWs) in a detailed three-dimensional ventricular wedge
   preparation. PUWs appear as fixed-shape wavelets that propagate only in
   the direction of cardiac fibers, with conduction velocity approximately
   40\% slower than normal action potential excitation. We investigate
   their properties, demonstrating that PUWs are not true solitons. The
   range of stimuli for which PUWs were elicited was very narrow (several
   orders of magnitude lower than the stimulus strength itself), but
   increased with reduced sodium conductance and reduced coupling in
   nonlongitudinal directions. We show that the phenomenon does not depend
   on the particular membrane representation used or the shape of the
   stimulating electrode.}},

Abstract = {{Subcritical water technology was used for treatment of Codium fragile
   (C. fragile) as a model for green macroalgae. Subcritical water
   reactions were carried out for 10 min at temperatures ranging from 100
   to 240 degrees C. After reaction, three main phases were isolated:
   aqueous, residual solid, and hexane soluble phases. The aqueous phase
   showed a very high total organic carbon (TOC) content due to
   decomposition and solubilization of the cellulosic portion and other
   organic molecules of the algae. The main products identified in the
   aqueous phase were soluble sugars, derived from hydrolysis reactions.
   The production of other biobased compounds was also examined and several
   value-added compounds were identified. Investigation of the residual
   solid phase after treatment showed that with increasing subcritical
   water temperature, the amount of total residual solid declined and
   finally reached a constant amount at higher temperatures, attributed to
   the inorganic composition of the algae sample. The maximum inorganic
   composition of the sample was identified as approximately 36\% based on
   dry matter. We also evaluated and compared the higher heating values
   (HHVs) of the residual solid residue and initial sample base on ultimate
   analysis. Finally, the hexane soluble content of this type of algae was
   found to be very low.}},

Abstract = {{Typically, the catalytic upgrading of heavy fractions (VGO and VR) has
   been studied using mostly conventional supported catalysts at
   temperatures and pressures higher than 400 degrees C and 6 MPa,

   lower severity conditions using dispersed NiWMo catalysts for processing
   whole oil with no fractionation. A kinetic study was developed to
   determine parameters from experimental data obtained at temperatures of
   320-380 degrees C and reaction times from 3 to 70 h at a total hydrogen
   pressure of 3.45 MPa and a stirring speed of 500 rpm in a batch reactor.
   The conversion, estimated as the reduction of the residue 545 degrees
   C(+) fraction, was fitted for a first-order reaction with an apparent
   activation energy of 200 kJ mol(-1) Two kinetic models are proposed to
   predict the conversion of the residue fraction and its product

Abstract = {{Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receivers used in
   applications which demand high accuracy are generally based on Real Time
   Kinematic (RTK) positioning. The positioning accuracy of such receivers
   primarily depends on the ability of the receiver to track the carrier
   phase of satellite signal. Unfortunately, from a tracking perspective,
   this parameter is the most sensitive to interference and attenuation.
   While the RTK based applications typically enjoy the full view of the
   sky most of the time, there are occasions when the satellite signals are
   obstructed due to foliage, high raised buildings, and other man-made
   structures. Under such operating conditions, maintaining phase lock can
   be a challenging task.
   Recent advances in the field of inertial navigation have shown that
   ultra-tight integration of Inertial Navigation System (INS) with a GNSS
   receiver can provide significant improvement in carrier phase tracking
   (Petovello et al 2007). This improvement, it appears, is limited by the
   quality of the receiver components. Specifically, it has been shown
   that, under weak signal conditions, the local oscillator is the main
   detriment for carrier phase tracking (O'Driscoll et al 2008).
   In this paper, the influence of the oscillator quality on carrier phase
   tracking performance is investigated. Particularly, the effects of
   acceleration sensitivity (or g-sensitivity) of the oscillator are
   examined in the context of pedestrian navigation. A method to compensate
   for the oscillator's g-sensitivity, using information from Inertial
   Measurement Unit (IMU) is proposed and tested. The algorithm is
   validated using a high quality IMU and, subsequently, the relative
   performance of a MEMS grade sensor is assessed.}},

Abstract = {{Generally, standalone GNSS receivers architectures cannot provide a
   position accuracy suitable for use in vehicular applications in urban
   canyon scenarios. By using a block processing scheme, this paper aims to
   obtain better position performance in the urban canyon areas for the
   high sensitivity receivers. Specifically, the signal peaks (i.e., LOS
   peaks, multipath peaks, and cross-correlation peaks) are separated in
   the Doppler domain. Generally, the dominant peak is utilized in the high
   sensitivity receivers, however, this assumption is not always valid in
   the multipath environment. In particular, it is not assured that the
   dominant peak is the LOS peak. In this regard, the most accurate peaks
   (i.e., LOS peaks) are identified in this paper which yields better
   position performance compared to the dominant peak scheme. Least-squares
   method and Kalman filter are compared in this work by processing live
   data collected in an urban canyon. For the least-squares solution, the
   position performance is better than 40 m after using the most accurate
   peak, and for the Kalman filter solution, it is better than 10 m. GNSS
   integrated with the dead-reckoning (DR) system is also assessed.}},

Abstract = {{Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers suffer significant
   degradation in indoor environments due to the effects of multipath and
   attenuation. Signal attenuation of up to 30 dB caused by loss of signal
   strength through a propagation medium makes signal detection more
   difficult and increase the variance of parameter estimation. Multipath
   reflections cause two problems; signal fading and considerable
   measurements errors in indoor locations. In this study, the accuracies
   of indoor GPS observations, namely pseudorange and Doppler measurements,
   are investigated in order to characterize the effect of noise and
   multipath on these measurements. Applying an A-GPS method and extending
   the coherent integration time up to hundreds of ms enable the receivers
   to acquire GPS signal indoors. Two DGPS strategies have been considered.
   The first DGPS measured the noise only effect and the second DGPS
   measured the integrated effect of noise and multipath. Comparing the
   measurements extracted from the two DGPS approaches, a good insight into
   the separate effect of noise and multipath is provided. Different
   metrics are analyzed, namely Delay profile, Power Spectral Density (PSD)
   and differential pseudorange and Doppler measurement precision.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the ever-growing coverage of WLAN networks the integration of
   these networks and GPS has become a promising approach to solving the
   problems encountered in indoor GPS positioning. 802.11 networks known by
   the trade name WiFi can be employed in several different ways as a
   complementary positioning technology for GPS navigation and the two can
   be used in an integrated framework to provide a continuous and robust
   positioning service. With WiFi becoming more and more ubiquitous there
   are many WiFi-enabled devices which have access to GPS but are not
   necessarily enabled for GSM/CDMA2000/WiMAX services.
   In this paper the concept of WiFi-based A-GPS as a promising approach
   for receiver-level integration of WiFi and GPS is presented. Although
   research has been dedicated to accomplish A-GPS systems using assistance
   information from wireless networks (such as cellular networks) no scheme
   has yet been published to use 802.11 WLAN signals to provide complete
   assistance information including frequency approximate user position and
   fine time assistance. This paper presents a method of relative time
   estimation sufficient to enable an effective and complete WiFi-based
   A-GPS. The proposed system can be deployed in places where WiFi coverage
   is available and where there is no or limited access to other
   synchronized systems based on the existing infrastructure. Examples
   include WiFi enabled mobile devices deployed on university campuses
   hospitals and shopping malls where there may be a need for providing
   A-GPS services to WiFi users that cannot access other networks.}},

Abstract = {{Doppler measurements play an important role in high sensitivity
   receivers for a few of reasons. They can provide some level of immunity
   over communication channels, convey user velocity, and attitude
   information, and can also be used to smooth pseudorange measurements.
   Regarding velocity, conventional estimation methods in high sensitivity
   receivers first get the Doppler by block processing the incoming samples
   and then compute the velocity using least squares (LSQ) or Kalman
   filtering (KF). However, in harsh indoor environments, Doppler
   measurements are often biased and very noisy due to multipath and
   fading, thus conventional velocity estimation methods are not very
   accurate and the quality is often very poor.
   This paper first reviews the implementation of a direct velocity
   estimation algorithm, which is basically the maximum likelihood estimate
   (MLE) of velocity, and then presents the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB)
   of the Doppler estimated with high-sensitivity receivers in indoor
   multipath environments. The CRLB of the conventional method and the
   direct method are then presented and discussed. Data collected inside a
   concrete building is processed in order to evaluate performance. In
   addition, the effect of adding signals from another GNSS (GLONASS in
   this case) is also assessed. Results show that jointly and directly
   processing GPS and GLONASS signals outperforms the conventional method,
   and the benefits of GLONASS are also apparent in some cases.}},

Abstract = {{Spoofing attacks can completely mislead the position solution provided
   by global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). Recently, several
   anti-spoofing techniques have been introduced to combat spoofing
   attacks. However, in most cases the available anti-spoofing techniques
   are computationally complex or limited to a specific spoofing scenario.
   This paper provides a low computational complexity approach to mitigate
   the spoofing signals based on an antenna array processing technique. The
   proposed method is established based on the fact that all spoofing
   pseudo random noise (PRN) codes are transmitted from the same source in
   space. This technique steers a null toward a spatial sector where the
   maximum spatial energy is coming from. To avoid unintentional
   attenuation of authentic signals due to the beam pattern profile, the
   received power of each authentic signal is maximized individually after
   spoofing mitigation. The proposed anti-spoofing technique provides a low
   computational complexity process that performs prior to the acquisition
   stage of GPS receivers. Moreover, this method does not require any
   antenna array calibration process. Therefore, it can be easily employed
   as a stand-alone anti-spoofing module at the receiver input. Simulation
   results show that the proposed anti-spoofing method performs well for a
   wide range of received spoofing power. To verify the applicability of
   this method in real-world scenarios, a real data set has been collected
   and processed without any outdoor propagation. The data processing
   results demonstrate the desired performance of the proposed technique
   for real spoofing scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{The reliability of an integrated navigation system can be improved by
   choosing proper sensor measurement variances, as characterized by the
   input measurement covariance matrix. In an integrated global navigation
   satellite system/inertial navigation system (GNSS/INS), the sensor noise
   characteristics of inertial sensors such as accelerometers and
   gyroscopes remain fairly constant while the quality of GNSS measurements
   varies depending on the environment.
   This paper proposes a novel approach to adapt the GNSS measurement
   variances by comparing the consistency of accelerations derived using
   GNSS and accelerometer measurements. Results obtained by processing data
   collected in different scenarios and environments are presented. The
   analysis shows the proposed method significantly improves the
   reliability of the navigation system. The algorithm is found to be very
   robust against multipath and provides a much more reliable solution even
   in highly degraded GNSS conditions. Further, when GNSS measurements are
   affected by multipath, not only does the reliability improve, but
   accuracy as well.}},

Abstract = {{Multipath propagation causes major impairments to satellite based
   navigation systems and is often the dominant source of accuracy
   degradation and a major issue for high precision Global Navigation
   Satellite System (GNSS) applications. Most of the commonly used
   time-of-arrival estimation techniques cannot provide the required
   estimation accuracy in severely dense multipath environments such as
   urban canyons.
   In this paper, the Doppler spectrum broadening (Doppler spread) of the
   fast fading channel (where the rate of the variations of the channel is
   faster than the symbol rate of the signal) resulting from the motion of
   the receiver or surrounding objects is employed for the purpose of
   signal decorrelation for the high-resolution estimation of multipath
   delays through the subspace-based Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC)
   technique. Specifically, delay-domain correlator outputs at different
   Doppler frequencies will be combined to enhance the rank of the signal
   autocorrelation matrix. Theoretical simulation and processing results of
   real data collected in downtown Calgary are presented to compare the
   performance of the proposed method with the spatial-temporal-diversity
   based MUSIC technique and a widely available algorithm in commercial
   GNSS receivers, namely the double-delta correlator technique. The
   performance metrics are based upon pseudorange and positioning errors.
   The pseudoranges and positions computed by the proposed techniques are
   compared to the reference trajectory established using a high precision
   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU).}},

Abstract = {{PPP integer ambiguity resolution is able to improve the positioning
   accuracy and reduce the convergence time. Several PPP integer ambiguity
   resolution methods have been developed which include the
   single-difference between satellites method, the integer phase clock
   model and the decoupled clock model. Although the ambiguity-resolved
   horizontal positioning accuracy was found significantly improved, the
   height coordinate improvement was always less significant than the
   horizontal counterparts. How to improve the accuracy of the
   ambiguity-resolved height solution requires further investigation.
   In this paper, the effects of the troposphere delay on the
   ambiguity-resolved height solution are studied. Unlike the regular
   troposphere estimation approach using meteorological data to calculate
   the troposphere delay, a troposphere constraint approach using the
   precise troposphere corrections is proposed to improve the
   ambiguity-resolved height solution. Numerical analysis is based on the
   decoupled clock model and hourly GPS data sets from a Canadian
   PPP-inferred troposphere precipitable water vapor system. The results
   indicate that by constraining the troposphere delay, the
   ambiguity-resolved height solution can be improved by 27.44\% when
   compared to that using the regular troposphere estimation approach.
   Therefore, in order to improve the ambiguity-resolved height solution,
   the troposphere delay product is highly desired in addition to the
   current PPP integer ambiguity resolution correction products.}},

Abstract = {{In practical real-time integrated navigation systems that fuse data from
   Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as the Global
   Positioning System (GPS) {[}1]{[}3]{[}4]{[}5] and Inertial Navigation
   Systems (INS) {[}2]{[}5], latencies (time delays) in inertial sensors or
   GNSS measurements may cause significant degradation of the navigation
   performance. These delays could be a significant contributor and source
   of errors in low-cost MEMS-based inertial sensors and GNSS receivers
   {[}8]{[}9]. This is because the processed data in a real-time system
   doesn't perfectly reflect current system dynamics. Instead, it
   represents the system dynamics a short period of time ago. Consequently,
   accurate analysis and assessment of such delays are of great importance
   in order to compensate for their effect in real-time system designs.
   Thus, this work introduces a software framework for simulating,
   analyzing and assessing the effects of time delays on an integrated
   INS/GPS navigation system. This framework depends on the emulation of
   real-time processing of a high-quality INS/GPS integrated navigation
   system. By saving the exact real-time sequence of INS sensors and GPS
   measurements processing steps of an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) in a
   loosely coupled embedded system, we were able to develop software tools
   that simulate different latencies in both INS and GPS to have a good
   sense of the effects of these latencies on the navigation performance in
   the lab without the need to perform too many time-consuming real-time
   tests. Different delays patterns were introduced and the effects of the
   latencies in different dynamic conditions were analyzed. Experiments on
   long trajectories with different GPS visibility conditions showed the
   efficiency of the developed tool to assess graphically and
   quantitatively the effect of such latencies.}},

Abstract = {{Integer ambiguity resolution is feasible for precise point positioning
   (PPP) and has received a lot of attentions due to its significant
   benefits to various applications. Several effective methods have been
   proposed in the past five years based on different observation
   combinations and positioning models. But no much reported work on
   integer ambiguity searching and validation in PPP. As to the integer
   ambiguity searching, it is often difficult to conduct the full ambiguity
   resolution particularly with a high level of reliability. For example,
   when a new satellite rises above the elevation angle mask, the
   observations to this satellite will be much noisier than other
   satellites and will affect the precisions of other ambiguities. This
   will slow down the speed of the integer ambiguity searching, or even
   lead to the wrongly fixed integer values. On the other hand, the
   challenge of the ambiguity validation lies in the determination of the
   thresholds for the reliability tests such as the success rate test and
   the ratio test.
   A partial ambiguity searching method is proposed in this paper. In
   addition, how to determine the thresholds for the reliability tests is
   also investigated. By using the proposed method, the PPP ambiguity
   subset can be fixed at a high level of reliability and with
   significantly reduced time. This can then speed up the PPP ambiguity
   resolution process and also make the ambiguity-resolved PPP solutions
   not affected by those ambiguities that cannot be reliably fixed.}},

Abstract = {{In geological area, such as petroleum and mining exploration, virtual
   reality (VR) immersive systems have been largely used for geological
   data treatments. Most of such VR systems involve unimanual interaction
   with data in a stereoscopic visual environment. Many research activities
   have shown that bimanual interaction tends to provide better performance
   when compared to unimanual interaction. Thus, we have designed a
   multi-sensory input and feedback system, which allows bimanual or
   multi-user interaction for analyzing and manipulating geological
   datasets. Within a three-dimensional (3D) stereoscopic visual
   environment, this system uses a haptic (force feedback) device to
   facilitate the analysis of geological datasets with the sense of touch;
   and a range camera to track in real time the position of a customized
   tool for manipulating (translating and rotating) the datasets. Our first
   implementation of the system has verified its appropriateness for user

Abstract = {{Errors in gyroscope measurements due to linear accelerations are often
   overlooked in foot mounted navigation systems. Accelerations of foot
   mounted IMUs can reach 5 g while walking and 10 g while running, but
   vary depending on the sensors location and mounting. These accelerations
   are often very short and can induce large biases in the gyro which can
   produce attitude errors when the measurements are integrated. This paper
   proposes a real time method for the mitigation of g-sensitivity errors
   whereby the coefficients are estimated in the navigation Kalman filter.
   Variations of the estimation scheme are given including estimating the
   diagonal terms of the 3x3 matrix or all nine elements of the matrix.
   Accuracy (RMS) improved by 45 \% and 61 \% in two data sets using two
   different sensors in different environments. Convergence rates of the
   estimated variance are also shown.}},

Abstract = {{In weak GNSS signal environments, extending integration time is
   paramount to improving the GNSS receiver's sensitivity. Furthermore,
   sufficient coherent integration can help to separate the line-of-sight
   (LOS) and non LOS (NLOS) signals - primarily in the Doppler domain - for
   multipath mitigation. However, extending integration time is limited by
   the presence of the navigation message data bits. The Maximum-Likelihood
   (ML) estimation method has been shown as the most effective way to
   estimate the navigation bit boundary locations (i.e., bit
   synchronization) and subsequently estimate the data bit values (i.e.,
   bit decoding) in the presence of noise alone. This paper further
   analyzes the performance of ML estimation method as a function of
   various other parameters by using the successful synchronization rate
   (SSR) and successful decoding rate (SDR) as the criteria. The parameters
   considered include the number of data bits required (i.e., integration
   time) and the Doppler frequency error, and both are evaluated under
   different signal strength scenarios. The requirements for bit
   synchronization are analyzed under three SSRs, which are 85\%, 90\% and
   95\%. Results indicate that, under the SSR of 90\% and the SDR of 90\%,
   bit synchronization and bit decoding are valid for signal strengths of
   15 dB-Hz and 20 dB-Hz respectively, and the Doppler frequency errors
   should not be larger than 24 Hz and 11 Hz respectively.}},

   constraint. The SE-EE tradeoff regime is found to be applicable only
   when certain conditions related to the outage objective and the BS

   the state of the battery's remaining charge and health parameters in
   computing the charge utility metric at each cluster formation round. The
   performance of the proposed protocol is assessed via analysis and
   simulations and the gains are quantified using common energy related
   metrics. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach is
   able to effectively increase the network lifetime significantly when
   compared to other distributed flat and hierarchical based routing
   protocols. The implication of the findings is that, by carefully
   harnessing the information pertaining to the nodes' battery condition at

Abstract = {{This report is devoted to examining vortex formation and interactions as
   they occur with isolated and tandem pitching and plunging airfoils.
   Motivation for understanding such flow phenomena is inspired from
   dragonflies, which exhibit a wide range of acrobatic flight maneuvers,
   possibly interesting for the realization of flapping drones known as
   Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs). Experimental investigations are described in
   which the kinematics of the forefoil and hindfoil could be independently
   varied, attaining any combination of pitch and plunge movements up to
   reduced frequencies of approximately k=0.3 in forward flight.
   Furthermore, the Reynolds number in these studies was varied between
   Re=3000 (hover) and Re=30000 (forward flight). Particle Image
   Velocimetry (PIV) was used to extract information on leading-edge vortex
   (LEV) and trailing-edge vortex (TEV) circulation, which in turn was
   useful in examining the growth rate and saturation often referred to as
   formation number. The following results will be presented: the effect of
   airfoil kinematics on LEV and TEV development; the influence of hindfoil
   interaction on the vortex formation and lift generated by the forefoil;
   and a quantification of the vortex interaction found in the hover
   condition. Finally, some thoughts regarding a new model of vortex growth
   will be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In order to achieve an overall low cost micro-pump, the valves, a
   critical micro-pump subcomponent, have been targeted for design for low
   manufacturing cost, high endurance, and reliability. In the proposed
   design, the inlet and outlet valves are etched on one piece of planar
   stainless steel shim stock. To investigate the static and dynamic
   behaviour of different valves, a design of experiment is performed on
   the geometrical dimensions of the valves. By using these physical
   results in a mathematical model for a micro-pump, the effect of valve
   parameters on micro-pump performance is predicted. Furthermore, a novel
   method for micro-pump valve selection is developed based on static test
   results for flow and backflow characteristics of different valves.
   Applying design for manufacture and mass fabrication techniques,
   together with an aim for high performance, robustness, and long fatigue
   life make the proposed valve design applicable to a variety of
   micro-pump applications.}},

Abstract = {{Stent strut configuration has been found to alter local fluid flow and
   wall shear stress (WSS) patterns that can promote intimal hyperplasia.
   To quantify these alteration, we used particle image velocimetry (PTV)
   to investigate local fluid dynamics distal to a deployed stent within an
   acrylic tube. A blood analogue mixture of glycerol and water was pumped
   through a flow loop in both steady and pulsatile conditions. Steady and
   pulsatile velocity profiles and near WSS (NWSS) predicted by PIV were in
   good agreement with the Poiseuille and Womersley estimations.
   Introduction of a Palmaz balloon expanded slotted tube stent increased
   centerline velocities between 6.9\% and 9\% and decreased NWSS distal
   from the stent outlet by > 40\%. Peak normalized vorticity was similar
   between non-stented and stented flows, although spatial coverage of
   higher vorticity was increased upon stent introduction. Future work will
   incorporate Echo PIV to complement PIV findings on how strut
   configuration affects flow dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{The real-time prediction of bearing wear for roller cone bits using the
   Intelligent Drilling Advisory system (IDAs) may result in better
   performance in oil and gas drilling operations and reduce total drilling
   cost. IDAs is a real time engineering software and being developed for
   the oil and gas industry to enhance the performance of complex drilling
   processes providing meaningful analysis of drilling operational data.
   The prediction of bearing wear for roller cone bits is one of the most
   important engineering modules included into IDAs to analyze the drilling
   data in real time environment.
   The `Bearing Wear Prediction' module in IDAs uses a newly developed wear
   model considering drilling parameters such as, weight on bit (WOB),
   revolution per minute (RPM), diameter of bit and hours drilled as a
   function of IADC (International Association of Drilling Contractors) bit
   bearing wear. The drilling engineers can evaluate bearing wear status
   including cumulative wear of roller cone bit in real time while
   drilling, using this intelligent system and make a decision on when to
   pull out the bit in time to avoid bearing failure. The wear prediction
   module, as well as the intelligent system has been successfully tested
   and verified with field data from different wells drilled in Western
   Canada. The estimated cumulative wears from the analysis match close
   with the corresponding field values.}},

Abstract = {{Lean value creation requires a value-adding network of lean activities
   across the whole Product Development Process (PDP). Management needs to
   allocate resources and properly control the process to create the value
   that stakeholders desire. Leading companies in industry have
   successfully applied Set-Based Concurrent Engineering (SBCE) for lean
   PDP. In SBCE, designers propose several feasible solutions and develop
   them relatively independently and in parallel, and then gradually narrow
   the sets of solutions based on updated project feedback at each
   stage-gate design review. As an important lean concept with many
   advantages, SBCE has constraints that can jeopardize lean value
   creation. For instance, it is unclear how resources are allocated to
   each stage, different functional teams, and different value creation
   activities related to different kinds of value, which can cause waste of
   talent, time, and money. This paper focuses on how resources can be
   allocated to SBCE by viewing product development activities as value
   creation cells. Under management control, lean value creation activities
   use knowledge and other resources to produce valuable design solutions.
   A mathematical feedback control model is proposed to illustrate how
   management can invest resources for the value creation process. This
   model can be used to explore resource allocation to functional teams and
   processes according to a holistic value creation project development
   strategy and the optimal creation of lean value.}},

Abstract = {{Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are presently being evaluated for
   their therapeutic potential in clinical studies to treat various
   diseases, disorders, and injuries. To date, early-phase studies have
   indicated that the use of both autologous and allogeneic hMSCs appear to
   be safe; however, efficacy has not been demonstrated in recent
   late-stage clinical trials. Optimized cell bioprocessing protocols may
   enhance the efficacy as well as safety of hMSC therapeutics. Classical
   media used for generating hMSCs are typically supplemented with
   ill-defined supplements such as fetal bovine serum (FBS) or
   human-sourced alternatives. Ideally, culture media are desired to have
   well-defined serum-free formulations that support the efficient
   production of hMSCs while maintaining their therapeutic and
   differentiation capacity. Towards this objective, we review here current
   cell culture media for hMSCs and discuss medium development strategies.}},

Abstract = {{blood testing is one of the most important clinical examinations.
   Counting different blood cells is a significant process in a clinical
   laboratory. Manual microscopic evaluation is compulsory in case there is
   suspicious abnormality in the blood sample. Yet, the manual inspection
   is time-consuming and requires adequate technical knowledge. Therefore,
   automatic medical diagnosis systems are necessary to help physicians to
   diagnose diseases in a fast and nonetheless competent way. Cell
   automatic classification has wider interest especially for clinics and
   laboratories. Segmentation is the most important step for automatic
   classification success. This paper represents an efficient technique for
   automatic blood cell nuclei segmentation. This technique is relying on
   enhancing the color of the target object, nucleus, and filtering the
   image. Small objects are eliminated employing morphological operations.
   A set of 365 blood images was used to quantitatively evaluate this
   segmentation technique. Assessment of the proposed technique on the
   blood image set gives 85.4\% accuracy. In comparison to other published
   technique that was implemented and executed on the same dataset, the
   proposed segmentation technique performance was found to be superior. A
   differential segmentation performance evaluation was performed on the
   five normal white blood cell types to compare isolated performance.
   Eosinophil was found to have the highest segmentation accuracy with
   90.1\%. Lymphocyte and Basophil have the lowest accuracy with 78.3\% and
   78.6\% respectively. The blood images dataset and the source code are
   published on MATLAB file exchange website for comparison and
   re-production.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient transmission scheme for
   monitoring soldier health in tactical mobile ad hoc networks (T-MANET).
   In the proposed scheme, a constrained route discovery algorithm is used
   to determine feasible routing paths between the source nodes and sink
   node. A cross-layer optimization approach is then used to determine the
   optimal routes and minimum power required to transmit data in the
   military UHF band such that the end-to-end packet delivery ratio (PDR)
   and end-to-end delay objectives are met. However, the optimal solution
   requires exponential complexity and is not suitable for implementation
   in resource constrained sensor motes. Therefore, we propose a heuristic
   algorithm called joint link node power allocation (JPA) that allocates
   power based on the presence of joint link nodes. From the analysis and
   numerical results, we find that JPA achieves energy consumption that is
   within 24\% of the optimal value, but significantly reduces the solution
   complexity from exponential to polynomial by utilizing 6 times fewer
   iterations than the optimal solution to converge to a minimum energy
   solution.}},

Abstract = {{Multi agent systems with autonomous interaction, negotiation and
   learning capabilities can efficiently model social behavior of
   individuals participating in a social network. A central problem in a
   social network is to identify the nodes that actively participate in the
   expansion of the net both physically and functionally. Several metrics
   have already been proposed to identify those hot spots. The algorithms
   to identify hot spots are either heuristic based or computationally
   expensive. In this paper we use an agent model of the social net and
   propose a method that can identify the neutral nodes, i.e. the nodes
   that can never be considered as hot spot nodes given the network
   topology and rules of negotiation among nodes. Therefore these nodes can
   be eliminated from the net. A direct advantage of this method is
   reducing the computational complexity for the configuration and
   identification of hot spots. Through a case study we have shown that the
   proposed method can lead to 33\% reduction of computation regarding the
   number of agent types in the example.}},

Abstract = {{The intravenous fluid of choice for acute blood volume replacement
   remains controversial. We focus here on the two hydroxyethyl (HES)
   available in Canada: HES 130/0.40 (Voluven (R)) and HES 260/0.45
   (Pentaspan (R)). Although information regarding their pharmacokinetic
   and risk/benefit profiles are available, how the infusion of these
   fluids could affect blood viscosity and vascular endothelial function in
   humans is largely unknown.
   Dynamic viscosity was measured at 21 degrees C and 37 degrees C through
   capillary viscometry. The HES solutions were driven through a closed
   flow loop at room temperature (21 degrees C). Viscosity at 21 C was 7.62
   centipoise (cP) for HES 260/0.45 and 2.73 cP for HES 130/0.40 decreasing
   to 4.23 cP for HES 260/0.45 and 1.72 cP for HES 130/0.40 at 37 degrees
   C. Analysis of viscous behaviour through pipe flow found that HES
   260/0.45 displayed marginal variations in viscosity suggesting Newtonian
   behaviour across our range of Re measured. HES 130/0.40 displayed an
   appreciable increase in viscosity at higher Re suggesting the presence
   of shear thickening behaviour.
   Human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) and human microvascular
   endothelial cells (HMVEC) were exposed to the HES solutions and saline
   to identify chemical effects on vascular endothelium. Western blot
   quantification showed that E-selectin was the leukocyte adhesion
   receptor that was most strongly affected, and this was not dose
   dependent. Interestingly, HAEC and HMVEC had different responses to HES
   treatment, suggesting that different vascular tissues may have different
   outcomes to HES infusion. Protein expression in HMVEC decreased when
   exposed to both HES solutions.}},

   resulted in a maximum uptake around R - 3.0. The surface area of
   nanoparticles/volume of the microemulsion followed the same trend as the
   nanoparticle uptake. The particle size increased as R, AOT concentration

Abstract = {{Abrasive and erosive wear of components and machinery is an ongoing
   challenge in the oil sands industry in northern Alberta, Canada. To
   improve the wear resistance by increasing surface hardness of steels,
   heat treatments and deposition of hard layers of metal alloys (such as
   stellite) by fusion welding techniques are traditionally used. However,
   these deposition techniques are not applicable to all shapes and add
   considerable weight to the final component. Thermal spraying techniques
   such as the use of high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) composite coatings
   based on WC-Co cermet system offer better wear resistance and greater
   flexibility in applications. This study presents work on two feedstock
   powders, namely nanocrystalline and microcrystalline WC-Co cermets, with
   identical matrix phase content: WC-17wt.\%Co. The novelty of the
   research is that an engineered duplex Co coated WC-17wt.\%Co cermet
   particle designed to withstand coating spalling under elevated loads as
   well as to limit abrasive debridement during wear is introduced for the
   first time to produce a more homogeneously-dispersed coating
   microstructure. The engineered particle has 6wt.\% of the ductile phase
   material mixed into the core to insure that the reinforcement WC phase
   is discontinuous to limit the debridement during wear, while remainder
   (11 wt.\%) of the Co is applied as a coating on the particle to improve
   the ductility. The mechanical properties of the overall particle are
   further improved by controlling the size of the reinforcing phase (WC)
   in the matrix (Co). This resulted in a WC-17wt.\%Co particle containing
   a characteristic WC grain in the order of 350 nm in the core with the Co
   outer coating of 1-2 mu m thick, making the powder particle as
   nanocrystalline. HVOF deposited coatings of the nanocrystalline and
   microcrystalline powders were examined for microhardness, fracture
   toughness, sliding abrasion (ASTM G133-05) and dry-sand rubber wheel
   abrasion (ASTM 065-04) wear performance. The wear rate under various
   loads and sliding distances was studied. In both the coatings, it was
   found that the wear rate increased with increasing applied loads, while
   it decreased with increasing sliding distances. 3D surface analysis of
   the wear tracks using atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed two
   distinctive mechanisms associated with the two coatings after abrasive
   wear. The improved wear resistance was attributed to the higher hardness
   value of the nanostructured WC-17wt.\%Co coating. It was also found that
   the nanostructured WC-17wt.\%Co coating has about twice the toughness of
   the conventional microstructured coating counterpart. The extent of the
   WC decarburization and the dissolution of Co in the coatings were also
   studied.}},

Abstract = {{Emergency vehicles (EVs) are used to provide essential services to
   society in the event of an emergency. Hence, crashes involving these
   vehicles are a concern, and investigating crash characteristics of EVs
   is the first step toward improving their safety. In particular, the
   contribution of any improper driver behavior or actions must be
   identified before (a) a program of behavior modification is recommended
   to authorities or (b) countermeasures are implemented to improve road
   safety, or both. This study attempts to identify the driver actions that
   contribute significantly to the severity of a crash involving at least
   one EV by using data from the Province of Alberta, Canada, for the
   period from 1999 to 2008. In addition, the impact of control variables
   formed from demographic, vehicle, environmental, and behavioral factors
   will also be explored. The results indicate that drivers' violations of
   the road rules significantly contributed to increasing the severity of
   crashes. Non-EV drivers' errors, nonrepairable damage to the vehicle,
   collision of an EV with a two-wheeler, and sun glare were some of the
   other variables that had significant influence on crash severity.}},

Abstract = {{Poor suspension increases slippage of the residual limb inside the

   evaluate the pistoning at the prosthetic linersocket interface during
   gait and assess patients' satisfaction with two different liners. Two
   prostheses with seal-in and locking liners were fabricated for each of
   the 10 subjects with transtibial amputation. The Vicon motion system was
   used to measure the pistoning during gait. The subjects were also asked
   to complete a Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire. The results revealed
   higher pistoning inside the socket during gait with the locking liner
   than with the seal-in liner (p < 0.05). The overall satisfaction with
   the locking liner was higher (p < 0.05) because of the relative ease
   with which the patients could don and doff the device. As such,
   pistoning may not be the main factor that determines patients' overall
   satisfaction with the prosthesis and other factors may also contribute
   to comfort and satisfaction with prostheses. The article also verifies
   the feasibility of the Vicon motion system for measuring pistoning

Abstract = {{Laser scanning, whether airborne or terrestrial is being used nowadays
   for wide spectrum of applications. In addition, many advances have been
   introduced to the laser scanning technology in the last decade; thus
   resulting into increased performance in terms of the point density,
   scanner range, and expected point accuracy. On the other hand, users are
   encountering scenarios where the integration of various laser datasets
   becomes essential in order to avoid data gaps (e. g., missing building
   roofs in the terrestrial scans, or missing structure facades in the
   airborne case). This problem is usually solved seamlessly through a
   classical transformation when the average point accuracy is relatively
   homogeneous over a given dataset. However, this is not usually the case;
   in this work, we propose a workflow for the optimal registration of
   multisource point clouds using weighted conformal transformation. First,
   the individual scans are filtered and the local point attributes are
   populated through a data characterization step. Then, an ICPP-based
   weighted registration algorithm is performed over the entire datasets
   until convergence. Finally, our heterogeneous segmentation procedure is
   performed in a simultaneous fashion to ensure exploiting the full
   potential of a dataset. The performance of this algorithm in terms of
   correctness, automation level, and other factors is evaluated using real
   datasets with significant variations in point densities and accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of digital building models and their necessities in many
   applications have attracted the focus of research efforts in the
   photogrammetric and computer vision communities. Therefore, many
   research activities have been attempted using different data sources and
   processing strategies to increase the automation level and accuracy.
   Limitations of using data from single sensors and the rapid development
   of sensor technology encourages combining data from multiple sources.
   Thus, this paper aims at generating accurate digital building models
   using airborne LiDAR data with imagery by combining two processing
   strategies -a data-driven approach and a model-based approach. In this
   research, initial rectangular models are derived from LiDAR data and
   model parameters are refined through model-based image fitting
   procedure. The advantage of the proposed approach is that it can utilize
   any number of images and overcome the limitation of occlusions which are
   the most common problem when dealing with large scale imagery over urban
   areas. The proposed methodology is tested using different number of
   images and the results demonstrate that the accuracy of the models are
   consistent regardless of the number of images used, even when a single
   image is used.}},

Abstract = {{Blood tests are of the most important and often requested clinical
   examinations. Manual microscopic assessment is a must do when a blood
   sample is suspicious of abnormality. This manual process is tedious,
   time consuming and subjective. Automating microscopic blood
   classification is desirable to help the pathologists to speed-up and
   enhance the results accuracy. Segmentation is the first and most
   important step in automatic blood cell classification. In this paper, we
   present an effective technique for automatic blood cell nuclei
   segmentation. The technique is based on gray scale contrast enhancement
   and filtering. Minimum segment size is implemented to remove false
   objects. The technique is tested on 365 blood images. The segmentation
   performance is quantitatively evaluated on the test set to be 79.7\%.
   This performance is high compared to other published algorithm executed
   on the same dataset. Evaluation is done on each of the five normal white
   blood cell types to compare separate performance. The lowest
   segmentation accuracy is for Eosinophil with 69.3\% and the highest is
   Monocyte with 86.3\%. The MATLAB source code and the blood images

Abstract = {{In a cluster-based wireless sensor network, to shorten the duration of a
   data aggregation process, wireless sensor nodes in different clusters
   may be required to perform concurrent transmissions. Inter-cluster
   interferences are usually resolved by using different channels among
   clusters. Since channel resource is limited, for large-scale networks,
   co-channel interferences are unavoidable. The problem becomes more
   severe when TDMA-based MAC protocols are employed. Such problem can be
   alleviated by controlling the transmission power levels of the
   concurrent users. In this paper, a transmission power control problem in
   wireless sensor networks is considered. The objective is to find optimum
   transmission power levels, which can obtain efficient trade-offs between
   energy consumption and the number of retransmissions. Different
   optimization schemes are investigated and analyzed using the concept of
   Pareto optimality.}},

Abstract = {{Network filtering has become an important security issue worldwide.
   Network filters are designed and put in place to enforce restrictions
   for a variety of different motives, such as political, social,
   economical or merely security reasons. Although network filters can be
   applied to different networks, their main use is for the Internet.
   However, as is the case with most network security measures, many
   network filters are bypassed by users and thus are not completely
   adequate to perform their tasks. This paper approaches the network
   filtering concepts from a software engineering perspective. The general
   purpose of this approach is to utilize automated methodologies to
   analyze the correctness of the requirements of the filtering mechanisms,
   and to reduce their vulnerability. In order to achieve this requirements
   are expressed using scenario-based specifications. The resulting
   scenarios are then analyzed for unwanted behavior using automated
   methodology. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approaches, it is
   applied to the case study of a real-life Internet-filtering system.}},

Abstract = {{In design of distributed systems with specification languages such as
   message sequence charts (MSC), communication between different component
   (agent) types or instances of them are defined. There are a number of
   methods to verify the design using scenarios of inter-component
   communication. Those methods usually ignore the intracomponent
   communication, i.e. communication between components of the same type.
   However in large scale systems, such as e-commerce systems, there are
   several components of one type that may communicate with each other and
   this may violate some regulatory policies defined in the design. On the
   other hand, there are declarative policies in system design that need to
   be integrated in the implemented system. In this paper a method that
   takes a topology of the system and regulatory policies as its inputs and
   detects the components having emergent behavior at its output is
   proposed. This method is defined to reveal the components that may
   violate the policies in the design phase by defining message types and
   extracting a version of MSCs called modified MSCs (MMSCs). Then by
   clustering and analyzing the send messages in the communications of
   different components the violating components are detected. By applying
   this method, all instances of components can be examined for policy
   violation in the implemented system. The method is explained along with
   a case study of a realistic online auction system and it is shown how
   this method can detect the components with emergent behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Emergent behavior in distributed systems is a central problem that may
   lead to unexpected behaviors and major faults. Emergent behaviors are
   usually categorized into three groups: emergent behaviors occur due to
   scenarios incompleteness; emergent behaviors as a result of violation of
   a system wide policy; and emergent behaviors as a result of synthesis of
   behavior models. In this paper, a technique for addressing the latter
   group is proposed. The technique prevents from overgeneralization in the
   behavior model synthesis. Overgeneralization happens as the result of
   behavior model synthesis and depends on the assumptions of the process.
   In addition, the proposed technique addresses the issue of the existing
   ad-hoc methodologies by providing an automated algorithm. This algorithm
   can be used by a syntax checker to automatically detect and correct the
   emergent behaviors in the scenarios. The proposed algorithm is validated
   using a case study of a fleet management system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a model comparison of a fixed speed wind turbine
   (FSWT) operating on a real wind farm. By relying on real data obtained
   from a wind farm operating in the Chilean Interconnected System, three
   different models are identified and analyzed. First, a phenomenological
   model based on physical principles governing the production of
   electricity from wind power is considered. This model is fine-tuned in
   accordance with practical considerations, such as wind correction
   factors. Then, a linear model and a Takagi \& Sugeno (T\&S) fuzzy model
   are identified. From the experimental results, the linear model is the
   simplest one, but also the one that presents the worst performance
   indexes. The best prediction capability is obtained with the T\&S model;
   however, in terms of interpretability, the phenomenological model
   outperforms the other two black-box models.}},

Abstract = {{The signal quantization process in a receiver can introduce loss of
   signal quality, especially in the presence of interference. The
   carrier-to-noise density ratio (C/N-0) is often used to describe the GPS
   receiver performance and, so, this signal quality loss is typically
   expressed in terms of a C/N-0 loss. This paper aims to provide a
   comprehensive analysis of the quantization loss incurred in a
   conventional GNSS receiver in presence of Continuous Wave (CW)
   interference in terms of C/N-0. This work seeks to extend the analysis
   of interference free case to further consider the interference
   characteristics and received interference power level. Simulation
   results show that traditional techniques used to estimate
   carrier-to-noise ratio are unreliable when interference is present. To
   avoid this problem, the bit error rate metric is employed in this work.
   By examining an increase in BER in the presence of quantization and
   interference relative to the interference and quantization free case,
   the corresponding loss in C/N-0 can be deduced. It will be shown that a
   receiver needs to adaptively adjust the quantizer gain both in the
   presence and absence of interference to minimize the total processing
   losses. This reduced processing loss can provide an associated
   improvement in both acquisition and tracking performance.}},

Abstract = {{Position solutions provided by GNSS receivers can be completely misled
   by spoofing attacks. Consequently detection and mitigation of spoofing
   signals have become one of the important topics within the GNSS
   community. Some recently published work has addressed spoofing attack on
   tracking receivers. The work has mostly focused on signal quality
   monitoring (SQM) techniques to detect spoofing and authentic signals
   interaction. SQM methods can effectively detect the spoofing correlation
   peak that is approaching the authentic signal. However, they are not
   applicable in cases where spoofing attack does not affect the shape of
   the correlation peak. This situation happens when a spoofer and
   authentic signals are almost aligned together. This paper provides an
   analytical approach to investigate the interaction between the authentic
   and the spoofing correlation peaks during spoofing attacks. Then, a
   spoofing detection technique based on amplitude analysis of different
   (namely very early (VE), early (E), prompt (P), late (L) and very late
   (VL)) correlator branches is proposed. The proposed spoofing detection
   technique continuously checks the distribution of each correlator
   output. Spoofing attack is detected if this distribution considerably
   deviates from that of the authentic signal. A vector based tracking
   receiver structure has been also employed to bridge the authentic signal
   outage during the spoofing attack. Data collection has been performed
   using the simulated spoofing attack by Spirent hardware simulator. Data
   processing results verify that the proposed spoofing detection and
   mitigation based on vector based (VB) receiver structure techniques
   perform well in real world scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{The use of high sensitivity GPS (HSGPS) receivers integrated with
   dead-reckoning sensors for pedestrian navigation has been broadly
   investigated and applied in the past decade. Pedestrian dead-reckoning
   (PDR) generally involves heading determination, step detection, and step
   length updates (Lachapelle et al 2006). Whenever HSGPS measurements are
   available, PDR parameters can be calibrated by making use of these
   measurements. However, the accuracy of the integrated system is governed
   by the quality of HSGPS measurements. Indoor HSGPS performance in wooden
   or concrete buildings has been assessed by numerous researchers (e. g.
   Kjaergaard et al 2010). Variance of Doppler estimates under standard and
   block processing techniques were analyzed and verified in Borio et al
   (2010).
   This paper provides theoretical results to characterize the Doppler
   errors obtained using maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) algorithms in
   various indoor environments with moderate pedestrian motion dynamics
   (for example, velocities are assumed below 2.5 m/s). Combined LOS/NLOS
   signal models are considered. An essential parameter set including
   Ricean factor, averaged multipath azimuth angle, multipath azimuth
   beamwidth, averaged multipath elevation angle, multipath elevation
   beamwidth, LOS azimuth, and LOS elevation angle is defined, in order to
   quantify the Doppler errors of MLE algorithms. Two real data sets were
   collected in indoor environments. MLE Doppler biases are observed in
   certain directional multipath dominant environments, which are in
   agreement with theoretical simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{During the last decade, the realization of the satellite gravity
   missions of CHAMP and GRACE, the acquisition of new gravity data and the
   development of novel processing methodologies has led to the
   determination of more accurate and higher in resolution global
   geopotential models. The spatial scale of similar to 110 km that EGM96
   could represent has improved today with EGM2008 to the level of similar
   to 16 km (full wavelength). This advance in the representation of higher
   frequencies by the geopotential models may signal the need to reassess
   the methodologies and techniques traditionally used for local and
   regional geoid determination. The traditional procedure followed is that
   of the remove-compute-restore method. The input functionals related to
   the Earth's gravity field are first reduced to a reference geopotential
   model, then the topographic effects are taken into account through one
   of the available reduction methods, computations follow using the
   reduced observations, and finally the contribution of the global
   geopotential model and the topographic indirect effects are added back
   to the computed reduced geoid values. One crucial point to this
   operation is that the attraction of the masses considered with a
   topographic reduction scheme is supposed to represent the medium and
   high frequencies in the gravity field, which still remain in the data,
   in principle even after they have been reduced to a geopotential model.
   Given that the best available digital depth models have a resolution of
   30 arcsec, which translates to roughly 1 km spatial wavelength, it
   becomes apparent that the contribution of such a model to the reduction
   of gravity and geoid data, when a high resolution geopotential model is
   used as reference, is questionable or should be at least investigated.
   This final point is the main goal of this paper, i.e., to investigate
   the contribution of the available digital depth models to the reduction
   of gravity anomalies and geoid heights when a geopotential model with
   the resolution of EGM2008 is used. To this extent, marine gravity
   anomalies and satellite altimetry sea surface heights are used off-shore
   the Atlantic coast of Argentina. EGM2008 is used as a reference surface
   to reduce the available gravimetric and altimetric observations, and the
   latest bathymetry model from the Scripps Institute of Oceanography group
   (SIOv11.1) is employed in order to compute topographic reductions based
   on the Residual Terrain Model (RTM) scheme. The results acquired are
   validated in terms of the reduction they provide to the available input
   data, both the mean and the standard deviation of the residuals, as well
   as in terms of the spectral content of the residual signal spectrum.
   Conclusions and recommendations on the use of topographic reductions and
   the treatment of topographic effects for geoid modelling in the presence
   of a high-resolution geopotential model are also drawn so as to ensure
   the consistency between data used and results acquired.}},

Abstract = {{To be competitive economically, various control systems are used in
   large scale wind turbines. These systems enable the wind turbine to work
   efficiently and produce the maximum power output in varying wind speed.
   In this paper, an adaptive control based on Radial-Basis-Function (RBF)
   neural network (NN) is proposed for different operation modes of
   variable-speed variable-pitch (VSVP) wind turbines including torque
   control at speeds lower than rated wind speeds, pitch control at higher
   wind speeds, and smooth transition between these two modes. The adaptive
   neural network control approximates the non-linear dynamics of the wind
   turbine based on input/output measurements and ensures smooth tracking
   of optimal tip-speed-ratio at different wind speeds. The robust NN
   weight updating rules are obtained using Lyapunov stability analysis.
   The proposed control algorithm is first tested with a simplified
   mathematical model of a wind turbine. Second, the validity of results is
   verified by simulation studies on a 5 MW wind turbine simulator.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose using a method of non-linear least squares to
   extract the Cole-Cole impedance parameters (R-o, R-infinity, alpha, tau)
   from collected frequency response datasets. We show how this method
   reduces the error of the extracted parameters when compared to direct
   extraction methods whose accuracy are limited by the measured low and
   high frequency gains. Parameters extracted using the non-linear least
   squares show up to 4 orders of magnitude lower relative error from ideal
   simulated datasets compared to direct methods. Experimentally extracted
   parameters from fruit tissue frequency responses verify the accuracy of
   the proposed non-linear least squares method over the direct extraction
   method.}},

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional (2D) space-time (ST) delay operator D-2D(ST) {[}.] and
   a novel discrete-space-continuous-time (DSCT) CMOS VLSI implementation
   at radio frequency (RF) is proposed. The proposed delay operator is able
   to delay 2D ST antenna array signals along space and time and can be
   used as a building block in 2D ST array processing algorithms. A 2D
   non-separable DSCT transfer function (TF), Phi(App) (z(x); s(ct)) is
   used to approximate the ideal 2D ST delay represented by the 2D TF
   Phi(Ideal) (s(x); s(ct)) = e(-tau)(alpha(x)s(x) + alpha(ct)s(ct)). A
   passive frequency planar transformation followed by bilinear transform
   along spatial dimension is used to derive Phi(App) (z(x); s(ct))
   starting from a 1D passive all-pass prototype. The 2D delay D-2D(ST)

   modules (AMs). A CMOS VLSI circuit operating at RF is proposed for each
   AM. Magnitude and phase frequency responses of a single AM operating at
   1 G H z is obtained using 65 nm TSMC CMOS simulations in Cadence and
   compared with the theoretical responses. The 2D phase frequency response

Abstract = {{Foot mounted navigation systems can be deployed for tracking military
   personnel, first responders and offenders. Determining the activity and
   environment of individuals can provide valuable information to those
   monitoring these individuals. This paper provides activity and
   environment classification for a foot mounted device that uses an IMU
   and GPS receiver. Using information from the navigation filter (e.g.
   velocity), GPS signal tracking parameters, and IMU measurements this
   paper presents an algorithm that classifies the following activities:
   indoor, outdoor, stationary, crawling, walking, running, biking, moving
   in vehicle, level, up or down elevator and up or down stairs. Multiple
   probability density functions that map each feature (Le. metric) to an
   activity are provided. Then a naive Bayesian probabilistic model is used
   to determine the probability of an activity. To improve reliability and
   accuracy of the classification several conditions are added. The
   algorithm shows excellent results for activity classification, however
   environment classification is less reliable due to variations in GPS
   tracking abilities as a function of the environment. Results are shown
   with images from the data collection.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate positioning of first responders, electronic monitoring, and
   military personnel is often critical in GNSS denied environments. In
   such environments, inertial navigation systems (INS) are typically the
   preferred tool to be used for navigation. However, the gyros suffer from
   errors including biases, scale factors and g-dependent errors being the
   most significant ones. In order to sustain an accurate navigation
   solution for long durations, the gyroscope errors have to be measured
   and mitigated. Ideally, this calibration is done in situ.
   The attitude obtained using visual information is independent of the
   errors affecting the gyroscope. Human-made environments are commonly
   full of straight and parallel lines found in orthogonal directions.
   Perspective projection mapping transforms three-dimensional scenes into
   two-dimensional images. The process maintains the straight lines but
   modifies their parallelism resulting in an apparent point intersection
   of the lines. This point is called the vanishing point. Lines in three
   orthogonal directions constitute three vanishing points. The vanishing
   point locations are dependent on the camera rotation, but not camera
   translation. By monitoring the motion of the vanishing point locations
   in consecutive images, the relative roll, heading and pitch attitudes
   may be obtained. The absolute attitude, known from some a priori
   knowledge of the building layout, is then used to update the inertial
   navigation filter. Over time the visual measurements mitigate the
   cumulative errors of the gyro bias, scale factor and g-dependent bias.
   The performance of the vision-aided INS based navigation approach is
   evaluated herein. A camera is attached to a backpack and foot of a user
   moving through typical pedestrian based environments. The case of a
   foot-mounted camera is unique because of the high accelerations
   experienced during the human gait. The visual-aiding correction is found
   to significantly improve the attitude accuracy, especially the heading.
   Using the body solution, namely the camera and INS attached to a
   backpack, the vision-aiding yielded a 93 \% improvement in the heading
   error during evaluation tests. With a foot-mounted solution, namely the
   INS and camera attached to the ankle of the user, the horizontal
   position error decreased by 34 \%.}},

Abstract = {{The exploitation of distributed generation based on intermittent
   renewable energy sources (RES) has increased the load and generation
   profile variability. The resort to distributed energy storage systems
   (DESSs) is usually proposed to compensate the volatility introduced by
   RES. In particular, plug-in electric vehicles (EVs) are considered one
   of the most interesting solutions for providing DESSs with the aim of
   exploiting RES production and matching the distributed electrical
   generation to the local demand. The aim of this paper is to analyze the
   impact of vehicle-to-grid technology on an weakly interconnected Virtual
   Power Plant (VPP) in order to evaluate the effects that distribution and
   availability of EVs charging structures can have on VPP total cost. A
   novel mathematical modeling of the mobility system is firstly developed
   to calculate the probabilistic distribution of parking places.
   Thereafter, the economic impact on a VPP has been evaluated for
   different plug-in ratio and charging station scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental legislation pressure on the energy sector to control
   greenhouse gas emissions is increasing. Regulations typically impose a
   limit on carbon emissions released by industries and set an emissions
   reduction target. If emissions reduction targets are not met, economic
   penalties are applied. Over the last decade, worldwide commitments to
   meet CO2 emissions reduction targets have challenged the process
   industries to reduce CO2 emissions. A key challenge for recovering
   carbon dioxide from industrial process sites is the low concentration of
   CO2 in the flue gas. The Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC)
   can provide a relatively pure CO2 exhaust gas that lends itself to
   sequestration.
   In this paper, integration of a site utility system with a gasification
   cycle is introduced as an option to provide a compressed CO2-rich stream
   from a process site. Optimization applies the results of screening
   studies based on rigorous simulation of the IGCC. The IGCC design
   parameters (including oxygen consumption, compressor pressure ratio and
   turbine pressure ratio) are optimized for two reference cases: maximum
   heat and maximum power generation. Interactions between the IGCC and CO2
   emissions compression train are explored for maximum heat and maximum
   power generation; further work will address economic and operational
   aspects of integrating the utility system with an IGCC.}},

Abstract = {{Concerns about global warming have led governments to regulate CO2
   emissions, including through emissions caps, trading and penalties, thus
   creating economic incentives to reduce CO2 emissions. Two retrofit
   approaches for CO2 emissions reduction in a process site are introduced,
   addressing strategies such as heat exchanger network (HEN) retrofit,
   operational optimization of the utility system and fuel switching. The
   first approach presents a conceptual method for analysis of the
   trade-offs between the cost of retrofit and CO2 emissions penalties. The
   second approach proposes a mathematical model for optimization of
   emissions reduction strategies. Optimization allows interactions between
   the HEN and the utility system to be explored systematically using a
   superstructure of CO2 reduction options. The design methods are applied
   to a case study and the results are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Variation reduction in multistage assembly processes is an important but
   challenging issue for quality control. It is desirable to minimize the
   final product variance from a system level. Fruitful research has been
   conducted on this issue based on the fixed assembly order. However, the
   variability of parts can be affected by different assembly order. In
   this paper, we propose a quality control strategy that takes into
   account the assembly order in two stage assembly processes.
   Specifically, we analyzed the relationship between the final product
   variation targets and the assembly order. A case study in conducted on a
   two stage assembly process of vessel diaphragm to illustrate the
   developed methodology disastrous.}},

Abstract = {{This study provides a comprehensive framework to mitigate or prevent
   forest and land (or wildland) fire disaster in Malaysia. This system
   supports emergency response and preparedness for wildland fire by means
   of integrated modelling, monitoring and mapping of fire danger. In this
   framework, multi-sensor applications for monitoring fire danger and fire
   activity are linked with decision-aid models in a Geographic Information
   System (GIS) environment to generate information required for wildland
   fire management. Using a customized version of the spatial Fire
   Management System software, components of the Malaysia Fire Danger
   Rating System (FDRS) are calculated to provide fire weather, fire
   behaviour and wildfire threat information. Wildfire threat ratings
   (WTRs) are assessed on the basis of fire occurrence risk, potential fire
   behaviour, suppression capability and values at risk. Outputs from the
   Malaysia FDRS were integrated with hotspots extracted from remote
   sensing data to generate combined maps of active fire locations, fire
   danger, potential fire behaviour and uncontrolled wildland fire (or
   wildfire) threat. In case of wildfire, remotely sensed data were also
   used to generate wildfire affected area and emergency response maps for
   emergency management. The system architecture and application models for
   wildfire analysis, which aid decision-making components for wildfire
   mitigation and relief, are described. These include early warning of
   fire, risk analysis, damage assessment and emergency response analysis.
   This article provides the first documentation of a national, operational
   system linking fire danger rating with socio-economic values, as defined
   by the WTR models, to guide fire and rescue decision-making during
   wildfire events. It is finally shown how the proposed system can reduce
   the risk of fire management disputes in Malaysia by directing the
   conflict to a more favourable resolution.}},

Abstract = {{Anisotropy is often determined experimentally from epicardial
   propagation measurements. We hypothesize that the direction of wave
   propagation on the epicardial surface is not aligned with the epicardial
   fiber orientation, due to intramural fiber rotation. In this paper, we
   modeled the effect of cardiac tissue fiber rotation on wave propagation.
   We used a three dimensional computer model of varying thickness with a
   120 degree fiber rotation through the thickness. The angle difference
   between the direction of propagation and fiber orientation was most
   pronounced for thin tissue, and decreased with increasing tissue
   thickness. This angle also increased with the time elapsed since
   stimulation. Finally, we demonstrated that the fiber rotation from
   epicardium to endocardium results in inaccurate measurements of
   conduction velocities at the epicardium, particularly in thin tissues.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual Reality (VR) simulators can offer alternatives for training
   procedures in the medical field. Most current VR simulators consider
   single-node contact for interacting with an object to convey
   displacement and force on a discrete mesh. However, a single-node
   contact does not closely simulate palpation, which requires a surface
   made of a multi-node contact to touch a soft object. Thus, we
   hypothesize that the softness of a deformable object (such as a virtual
   breast phantom) palpated through a single-node contact would be
   perceived differently from that of the same phantom palpated through a
   multi-node contact with various force arrays. We conducted a study to
   investigate this hypothesis. Using a co-located VR setup that aligns
   visual and haptic stimuli onto a spatial location, we tested 15 human
   participants under conditions of both visual and haptic stimuli
   available and only visual (or haptic) stimulus available. In a trial,
   each participant palpated and discriminated two virtual breast phantoms
   of same softness through different contacts with varying force arrays.
   The results of this study revealed that virtual breast phantoms palpated
   through a single-node contact were constantly perceived harder than
   their counterparts palpated through a multi-node contact with varying
   force arrays, when visual stimuli were available. These results imply a
   constraint for developing a VR system of training palpation.}},

Abstract = {{Data acquired using Optical Mapping (OM) studies are affected by motion
   artifacts due to the inherent contraction of the heart. Those artifacts
   can be reduced by registering the images obtained by the OM system or by
   the combination of approaches like physical restraint of the heart or
   ratiometry with image registration. Due to the lack of high contrast
   features most registration methods are not suitable for this
   application. This paper is focused on the utilization of scale space
   theory and local descriptors to enhance the detection of local features
   in OM images and to describe the movement of keypoints. This information
   can be used to determine a suitable set of transformations to perform
   the registration process.}},

Abstract = {{During training and competition in short track speed skating, skaters
   commonly fall on the ice and slide into crash pads that line the boards
   of the rink. Skaters wear helmets to protect their heads from such
   impacts. Nevertheless, concussion injuries are not uncommon, especially
   from impacts into the crash pads. Basic mechanical principles suggest
   that, all other things being equal, smaller sized and rounder shaped
   helmets should reduce peak impact forces when hitting relatively soft
   crash pads. This study validates these assumptions and determines the
   magnitude of these effects using drop tests and a 3D accelerometer.
   Hemispherical head forms of various radii, each weighing approx. 4.5 kg,
   were dropped from four heights (0.3-4.0 m) onto a crash pad. Peak linear
   decelerations were recorded. In one set of tests, complete hemispheres
   were used, highlighting the effect of helmet size (radius). In a second
   set of tests, another set of hemispheres of various radii were sliced to
   produce caps each with a diameter of 8 `' but each with a different
   radius of curvature. Impact tests at four drop heights using these caps
   revealed the effect of helmet shape. Size was found to be more important
   than shape, with the greatest effects being in the 10-20 cm radius
   range, a range which is relevant to helmets used in the sport today. (C)

Abstract = {{Alberta woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus) are classified as
   threatened in Canada, and a local population in the west-central region,
   the Little Smoky herd, is at immediate risk of extirpation due, in part,
   to anthropogenic activities such as oil, gas, and forestry that have
   altered the ecosystem dynamics. To investigate these impacts, we have
   developed a spatially explicit, agent-based model (ABM) to simulate
   winter habitat selection and use of woodland caribou, and to determine
   the relative impacts of different industrial features on caribou
   habitat-selection strategies. The ABM model is composed of cognitive
   caribou agents possessing memory and decision-making heuristics that act
   to optimize tradeoffs between energy acquisition and disturbance. A set
   of environmental data layers was used to develop a virtual grid
   representing the landscape over which caribou move. This grid contained
   forage-availability, energy-content, and predation-risk values. The
   model was calibrated using GPS data from caribou radio collars (n = 13)
   deployed over six months from 2004 to 2005, representing caribou winter
   activities. Additional simulations were conducted on caribou
   habitat-selection strategies by assigning industrial features (i.e.,
   roads, seismic lines, pipelines, well sites, cutblocks and burns)
   different levels of disturbance depending on their type, age, and
   density. Differences in disturbance effects between industry features
   were confirmed by verifying which resultant simulations of caribou
   movement patterns most closely match actual caribou distributions and
   other patterns extracted from the GPS data. The results elucidate the
   degree to which caribou perceive different industry features as
   disturbance, and the differential energetic costs associated with each,
   thus offering insight into why caribou are choosing the habitats they
   use, and consequently, the level and type of industry most likely to
   affect their bioenergetics and fitness. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{A new inversion strategy is presented that integrates a radar-based
   method with microwave tomography (MT) to efficiently provide low
   resolution information about an object's structure and average
   properties. The inversion technique is carried out in two steps. First,
   locations and spatial features of regions of interest are estimated
   directly from ultrawideband (UWB) reflection data and used to create
   reconstruction models. These models are incorporated into the next step
   which estimates mean dielectric properties over each region with MT. A
   practical application is explored using a 2D breast model formed from
   the magnetic resonance (MR) scan of a patient. The algorithm's ability
   to infer the breast's basic internal structure is demonstrated with this

Abstract = {{Energy resource management is considered essential in battery-operated
   Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Radio communication circuitry is a
   significant power consumer in a WSN. Therefore, it is desired to design
   an efficient routing algorithm which conserves the battery power as much
   as possible, resulting in a longer network lifetime. Lifetime-aware
   routing protocols were suggested to distribute the flow of information
   through different routes. These works were mainly based on simplified
   assumptions which ignored practical considerations and assumed perfect
   knowledge of the channel conditions and the ability to adjust the
   transmission power accordingly. In this work, the practical case of a
   constant transmission level is applied to the Flow Augmentation
   algorithm and the lifetime performance of the proposed modified Flow
   Augmentation algorithm called Constant Transmission Power Flow
   Augmentation (CTPFA) is evaluated and compared with the original Flow
   Augmentation. The CTPFA analysis proves that lifetime of a WSN with
   nodes that have constant transmission power decreases significantly due

Abstract = {{Sensing Spatial Coverage (SSC) is one of the main Quality of Service
   (QoS) measures in a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). This quantifies the
   WSN monitoring ability. The initial phase of WSN implementation is to
   determine how many sensors with specific sensing ability are required
   for the intended application or scenario. For this purpose, the sensing
   profile of the sensors should be known. Most of the previous works
   considered a Boolean model for the sensors, limiting the sensing ability
   to a fixed radius known as the sensing range. The sensing ability of the
   sensors depends on the nature of the application they are used for. In
   this work fire detection is assumed to be the application and the sensor
   consists of a simple Infra-red (IR) photodiode. A realistic sensing
   model will be introduced and the detection ability of the sensor will be
   studied in detail and closed form formulas will be derived for the
   probability of fire detection in different distances.}},

   helps the voltage recovery, while the real power improves the damping

   of integrated circuits in which the network carrying the clock signal is

   This paper highlights properties of common algorithms for performing CTS

Abstract = {{This paper presents novel design and architecture for inverted Doherty

   achieve high efficiency performance at back-off. This coupled line thus
   designed as an all-pass filter section with shaped phase characteristic
   and a 50 Omega image impedance that can be used directly to optimize the
   inverted Doherty performance. A prototype has been designed to operate
   at 2350 MHz for Long term evolution (LTE) application. An improvement of
   more than 25\% in the drain efficiency as compared to the Class-B

Abstract = {{A major disadvantage of diode clamped inverters (DCI) in practical
   implementations is capacitor dc voltage fluctuation. A new and very fast
   space vector modulation scheme for controlling the capacitor dc voltage

   accelerates the computation of the nearest three vectors and calculation
   of corresponding duty cycles without an increase in computational
   requirements when extended to DCIs with more levels. This new algorithm
   is appropriate for real time applications with DSP controllers used in
   industry. Performance of the proposed method has been simulated in
   MATLAB Simulink for both 3-level and 4-level three-phase DCIs, with
   experimental verification presented using a TMS320F2812 DSP.
   Experimental implementations demonstrate that the proposed method has
   the ability to effectively control dc-capacitor voltage in an N-level
   DCI where N is the number of levels (including zero volts) in one half

Abstract = {{Modeling and implementing auction systems using agent technology is a
   common practice because agents can assume various roles and their
   behavior will be determined as a result of negotiation. However,
   emergent behavior is a hurdle. Mechanisms must be in place to make sure
   that agents participating in the auction systems won't behave in an
   unintended way. Detecting emergent behaviors in the design phase rather
   than the deployment is more cost and effort efficient. Patterns of
   interaction, called scenarios, are the basic modeling constructs for
   design and behavioral modeling of agents. However, working with several
   agents in an online auction system needs large number of scenarios.
   Therefore transforming scenarios to finite state machines (FSM) and
   parallel execution of the FSMs in the behavioral synthesis phase may
   lead to computational overload. So far all the research has been around
   the ways of detecting emergent behavior and scalability of behavioral
   modeling has been an issue. In this paper a method to identify those
   agents that will not cause emergent behavior is introduced. Then by
   eliminating them from the behavioral modeling phase, the number of FSMs
   and their states will be reduced. The method is explained along with a
   case study of a realistic online auction system that has led to 33\%
   reduction of synthesized FSMs.}},

Abstract = {{Ontologies have been utilized in many different areas of software
   engineering. As software systems grow in size and complexity, the need
   to devise methodologies to manage the amount of information and
   knowledge becomes more apparent. Utilizing ontologies in requirement
   elicitation and analysis is very practical as they help to establish the
   scope of the system and facilitate information reuse. Moreover
   ontologies can serve as a natural bridge to transition from the
   requirements gathering stage to designing the architecture for the
   system. However manual construction of ontologies is time consuming,
   error prone and subjective. Therefore it is greatly beneficial to devise
   automated methodologies which allow knowledge extraction from system
   requirements using an automated and systematic approach. This paper
   introduces an approach to systematically extract knowledge from system
   requirements to construct different views of ontologies for the system
   as a part of a comprehensive framework to analyze and validate software

   digital Doherty PA architecture is then pointed out as the most suitable
   topology that enables an optimal operation of the Doherty PA. This
   architecture allows for the implementation of advanced digital signal
   processing algorithms, such as adaptive input power distribution and
   dynamic phase alignment that are experimentally proven to bring
   substantial performance enhancement.}},

Abstract = {{A novel technique used to design a simple version of an adaptive
   neuro-fuzzy controller (ANFC) is described in this paper. The structure
   of the proposed Adaptive Simplified Neuro-Fuzzy Controller (ASNFC)
   consists of reduced numbers of input membership functions (MFs) and
   consequence parameters (CPs). A Neuro Identifier (NI) is used to track
   the behaviour of the plant on-line and update the controller. The ASNFC
   is applied to an SVC device, located at the middle of a single machine
   infinite bus system (SMIB), to damp power system oscillations. Results
   of simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed ASNFC provides
   similar control actions as the ANFC, but with less parameters to
   optimize Although the proposed controller is a simplified version of the
   ANFC, the simulation results obtained show system responses similar to
   that with the ANFC.}},

Abstract = {{Facial expressions are a valuable source of information that accompanies
   facial biometrics. Early detection of physiological and psycho-emotional
   data from facial expressions is linked to the situational awareness
   module of any advanced biometric system for personal state
   re/identification. In this article, a new method that utilizes both
   texture and geometric information of facial fiducial points is
   presented. We investigate Gauss-Laguerre wavelets, which have rich
   frequency extraction capabilities, to extract texture information of
   various facial expressions. Rotation invariance and the multiscale
   approach of these wavelets make the feature extraction robust. Moreover,
   geometric positions of fiducial points provide valuable information for
   upper/lower face action units. The combination of these two types of
   features is used for facial expression classification. The performance
   of this system has been validated on three public databases: the JAFFE,
   the Cohn-Kanade, and the MMI image.}},

   call macroscopic the description in which the body is considered as a
   continuum and we refer to the microscopic scale when a crack is studied
   at a closer view. We first propose an approximation of the stress and
   strain fields in the vicinity of a crack, considering the neighboring
   discontinuities. We then use equivalence principles between micro- and
   macroscopic scales in order to determine the expression of the
   macroscopic constitutive assignments of the body. The latter are written
   not only in terms of the local values of the deformation and the local
   values of the geometrical variables representative of the crack field,
   but also in terms of their gradients. Numerical implementations are
   performed; we compare constitutive laws obtained from local and nonlocal

Title = {{The Generation of Correlated Gamma Distributed Random Fields for the

Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON IMAGING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1261-1290}},
Abstract = {{Simulation plays an important role in both the development and analysis
   of new radar imaging and processing systems and in the analysis of their
   data. We have developed a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) simulation
   system, cSAR, that simulates the raw signal data. An important component
   of this system is the simulation of clutter, or the random spatial
   fluctuations of backscatter. The prevailing statistical model for
   clutter is the K distribution. This model is founded on a gamma
   distributed scattering coefficient. In this paper we present a system
   for simulating correlated gamma distributed fields of scattering
   coefficients. Our system starts with the requirement that in radar and
   other coherent imaging scenarios the locations of elemental scene
   scatterers must be random to achieve fully developed speckle in the
   image. We start with a set of scatterers whose spatial location follows
   a uniform distribution. To generate a correlated random field with this
   random distribution of scatterers we use the turning bands method. We
   show that the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the simulated random
   fields matches the analytical ACF. To transform the correlated Gaussian
   random field into a correlated gamma random field we use the memoryless
   nonlinear transform (MNLT). It has been shown that the MNLT skews the
   ACF of the simulated field. We present a method to preserve the form of
   the ACF of the field using a mapping function developed by Tough and
   Ward {[}J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys., 32 (1999), pp. 3075-3084]. We
   demonstrate that the ACF of the simulated field is preserved. Once the
   random field of scatterers is created, the scattering coefficient s can
   be approximated with a local summing process, which emulates the
   incoherent imaging process of a SAR sensor. There is evidence in the
   literature that the sum of correlated gamma variates on a regular grid
   is also gamma distributed. We develop a new theory for the first and
   second order linear sum process (LSP) statistics for a random sum of
   random variables. We use this theory to derive two estimators for the
   gamma order parameter. Through a Monte Carlo experiment, it is shown
   that s, as represented by the LSP, does generally follow a gamma
   distribution for scenarios with at least nine scatterers per resolution
   cell. The order parameter and correlation properties are modified from
   the original random field according to patterns predicted by our theory,
   though some parameters must be calculated through simulation.}},

Abstract = {{In typical adaptive control using fuzzy function approximators, the
   centers of the decoding membership functions become adaptive parameters.
   As with any direct adaptive control, drift of adaptive parameters to
   large magnitudes can eventually lead to bursting behavior. Previous
   methods proposed for robust training utilize a mathematical modification
   of the update law, and may sacrifice significant performance to
   eliminate the risk of bursting. This paper proposes taking advantage of
   the local nature of fuzzy membership functions to design an
   introspective algorithm. At the moment the trajectory leaves a domain,
   the algorithm decides whether to keep the Lyapunov-stable adaptive
   update made during the domain activation, or discard it ( depending on
   whether the error was decreased over the domain or not). The ability to
   account for large nonlinearities in a stable and high-performance manner
   is verified through an experiment with an underdamped flexible-joint
   robot.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses biometric identification using large databases, in
   particular, iris databases. In such applications, it is critical to have
   low response time, while maintaining an acceptable recognition rate.
   Thus, the trade-off between speed and accuracy must be evaluated for
   processing and recognition parts of an identification system. In this
   paper, a graph-based framework for pattern recognition, called
   Optimum-Path Forest (OPF), is utilized as a classifier in a
   pre-developed iris recognition system. The aim of this paper is to
   verify the effectiveness of OPF in the field of iris recognition, and
   its performance for various scale iris databases. The existing
   Gauss-Laguerre Wavelet based coding scheme is used for iris encoding.
   The performance of the OPF and two other - Hamming and Bayesian -
   classifiers, is compared using small, medium, and large-scale databases.
   Such a comparison shows that the OPF has faster response for large-scale
   databases, thus performing better than the more accurate, but slower,
   classifiers.}},

Title = {{Demand and Supply Calibration of Dynamic Traffic Assignment Models Past
   Efforts and Future Challenges}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{2283}},
Pages = {{100-112}},
Abstract = {{The calibration of dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) models has evolved
   rapidly over the past decade and has been fueled by the need for
   applications ranging from long-term planning to real-time traffic
   operation. Numerous formulations and solution approaches based on either
   analytical or simulation-based approaches have been introduced. The aim
   of this paper is the documentation of the existing DTA model calibration
   approaches for future reference. The literature on the calibration of
   DTA models can be categorized on the basis of the two major components
   that need to be calibrated: demand and supply model estimation. Travel
   behavior modeling and origin-destination demand estimation problems are
   considered in the determination of demand models. Supply models simulate
   traffic dynamics, queue formation, dissipation, and spillback in either
   a microscopic or mesoscopic context. Early DTA model calibration efforts
   were based on iteration between the two demand and supply components.
   Recent frameworks have focused on the simultaneous calibration of both
   components. Therefore, different solution approaches have been addressed
   with various functional needs and degrees of robustness. This paper
   summarizes the current understanding of calibration and estimation of
   all input parameters for a DTA model, reviews the existing literature,
   and highlights the gaps that need to be addressed in future research.}},

Abstract = {{Grain size, their distribution and geometry are important to study the
   dislocation behavior and grain boundary sliding of ceramic reinforced
   metallic composite materials. Grain size reduction has been shown to
   lead to significant improvements of the wear resistance in
   nanostructured materials. As the grain size decreases from
   polycrystalline to nanocrystalline range, abrasive wear resistance
   increases considerably from the increased hardness and volume loss
   following Archard's law of wear. Further, the heat treatment effect on
   the content of the metallic binder in a ceramic-metallic (cermet)
   material is thought to increase the hardness with decreasing crystalline
   size, thereby improving the sliding wear behavior of materials. In this
   study, the high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) thermal spraying of
   nanostructured WC-17Co coatings with engineered `duplex outer coating'
   is conducted. The microhardness and sliding wear studies of the coatings
   and their heat-treated counterparts are performed. The nanostructured
   coatings showed a significant increase in the microhardness and wear
   resistance when compared with those of the conventional microstructured
   coatings of the same composition. It is believed that the improved
   performance is related with the work hardening as well as dispersion
   hardening of the nanostructured grains in the deposited coatings.}},

Volume = {{7}},
Abstract = {{Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is showing promise as an
   alternate method to fMRI for studying cortical function. Resting state
   studies in both methods are showing functional linkages. The strength of
   functional connections is typically quantified by the level of
   significance of the temporal synchrony between brain regions, termed
   resting-state functional connectivity. Coherence analysis of resting
   state allows for phase insensitive and frequency specific analysis. This
   paper provides a detailed method for undertaking fNIRS in combination
   with resting-state coherence analysis. We show that maps of
   inter-hemispheric resting-state functional connectivity between the
   motor cortices can be reliably generated, and the frequency responses
   (to 50 Hz) for both oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin. Frequencies of 0-0.1 Hz
   provide robust data as have been shown previously. Higher frequencies
   (up to 5 Hz) also exhibit high coherence. Deoxyhemoglobin also shows
   high coherence above 10Hz. Coherence is similar during both resting and
   task activated states. fNIRS allows for mapping cortical function and,
   in combination with coherence analysis, allows one to study variations
   in frequency response. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{Freeform surfaces have been widely used in various engineering

   surfaces have led to significant challenges for the manufacturing of

   introduced in this paper by integrating inspection and tool path
   generation to improve manufacturing quality while reducing manufacturing
   efforts. Inspection is conducted by comparing the digitised manufactured
   surface with the design surface to identify the error regions. In this
   new inspection technique, the areas on the manufactured surface that are
   beyond the design tolerance boundaries are used as the objective
   function during the localisation process, in order to minimise
   post-inspection machining efforts. The tool path generation methods are
   then selected based on the geometric characteristics of the identified
   error regions, for creating tool paths to remove the errors.
   Computational efficiency, machining efficiency, and quality are
   considered in this integrated method.}},

Abstract = {{Making quality control in the design stage can greatly improve product's
   robustness and save costs. The whole system function variance model and
   the sensitivity index model are established combined with axiomatic
   design and then making comparative evaluation to them combined with
   information axiom. A fundamental model of describing relationships among
   function and structural characteristics, design parameters and
   uncontrollable factors in non-linear systems which based on Taylor
   expansion is proposed. And then the relation between robust design,
   information axiom and the concept of information is expounded. The
   solution to information amounts can be used as the evaluation index to
   the result of robust design. Finally, combined with coating head example
   show that the method can optimize design parameters reasonably, reduce
   design time and cost effectively under the premise of meeting product
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{A new method of enhancing the bandwidth of a conventional series-peaked
   transimpedance amplifier (TIA) driven by a large photodiode is
   introduced. It is shown that by using N identical TIAs in parallel the
   circuit bandwidth can be significantly improved. The advantage of the
   proposed technique is in its ability to provide large bandwidth
   enhancements in multi-GHz frequency ranges even when photodiode
   capacitance is large, without a noticeable increase in TIA core circuit
   area. This technique is supported by a design example simulated in a
   0.13 mu m standard CMOS technology. Simulation results show a 3dB
   bandwidth of 26GHz with 0.5pF photodiode capacitance, a transimpedance
   gain of 51dB Omega and group delay of 33.5 +/- 4ps. The proposed
   technique shows an overall bandwidth enhancement ratio of 3.25 with less
   than 0.1dB gain ripple resulting in higher bandwidth enhancement than
   previously reported for large photodiode capacitances.}},

Abstract = {{Majority of biometric researchers focus on the accuracy of matching
   using biometrics databases, including iris databases, while the
   scalability and speed issues have been neglected. In the applications
   such as identification in airports and borders, it is critical for the
   identification system to have low-time response. In this paper, a
   graph-based framework for pattern recognition, called Optimum-Path
   Forest (OPF), is utilized as a classifier in a pre-developed iris
   recognition system. The aim of this paper is to verify the effectiveness
   of OPF in the field of iris recognition, and its performance for various
   scale iris databases. This paper investigates several classifiers, which
   are widely used in iris recognition papers, and the response time along
   with accuracy. The existing Gauss-Laguerre Wavelet based iris coding
   scheme, which shows perfect discrimination with rotary Hamming distance
   classifier, is used for iris coding. The performance of classifiers is
   compared using small, medium, and large scale databases. Such comparison
   shows that OPF has faster response for large scale database, thus
   performing better than more accurate but slower Bayesian classifier.}},

   paper explores options for large data centres to reduce costs in this
   way. Simulation results are presented for a system that models the
   processing of a workload and the resulting energy use, focusing on the
   impact of providing specific types of ancillary services. Trace data
   recording the workload from three supercomputing facilities along with
   pricing information from a US-based electrical grid are used. Results
   presented show energy costs reduced by up to 12\% with only a small
   impact on the quality of service provided to users of the data centre.
   Further reductions in energy costs are shown for data centres willing to
   cede more control over short-term energy consumption.}},

   mixed-signal 90nm CMOS process. The eye diagrams of the transmitted
   signal and of the received signal at the end of a 40-inch FR-4 channel

Abstract = {{Spoofing and jamming in the form of transmitting counterfeit location
   information and denying services are an emerging threat to GNSS
   receivers. In general, spoofing is a deliberate attack that aims to
   coerce GNSS receivers into generating false navigation solutions. The
   spoofing attack is potentially more hazardous than jamming since the
   target receiver is not aware of this threat and it is still providing
   position/navigation solutions which seem to be reliable. One major
   limitation of spoofers is that they are required to transmit several
   highly correlated GNSS signals simultaneously often from a single source
   in order to present a truthful navigation solution to the receiver.
   Different GNSS signals sourced from a single transmitter have
   essentially the same spatial signature, which as shown in this paper,
   can be utilized to discriminate the spoofing signals. In this paper a
   moving antenna is investigated to discriminate between the spatial
   signatures of the authentic and the spoofing signals based on monitoring
   the amplitude and Doppler correlation of the visible satellite signals.
   The effectiveness of this detection method is studied and verified based
   on a set of experiments.}},

Abstract = {{This paper assesses a novel method of using a quasistatic magnetic field
   to provide updates to the navigation (i.e. attitude) filter. The method
   is able to make use of magnetometer measurements in a perturbed magnetic
   field, under the condition that the field's magnitude remains constant
   for short periods of time. The fact that magnetometer measurements can
   still be used in perturbed environments makes this update significant in
   terms of incorporating the magnetometer measurements into a navigation
   solution. The QSF process requires a detection algorithm to first
   identify quasi-static fields and second to perform the update. Thus this
   paper applies the QSF algorithm in a navigation filter to assess its
   performance in GNSS degraded or denied environments. Data sets are used
   to assess QSF updates. These range from open athletic fields to deep
   indoors where GPS signals are denied. The environments vary in terms of
   soft iron effects. The data was collected with high grade miniature MEMS
   IMUs, a high sensitivity GPS receiver and a low cost magnetometer. An
   accurate reference solution is derived from a tactical grade IMU. For
   the backpack mounted IMU the application of QSF updates yielded a 56 \%
   heading error improvement when used as a heading reference system. For a
   corresponding ankle mounted system the application of QSF updates
   yielded a 56 \% improvement in the position error (RMS) when used as a
   pedestrian navigation system. The maximum error over a 45 minute GPS
   outage decreased from 208 m to 128 m. The updates do not significantly
   decrease the estimated gyro error state variances, indicating that it is
   more suited for gyros and magnetometers with a lower performance than
   those used herein.}},

Abstract = {{GPS signal detection and parameter estimation are compromised in
   attenuated and harsh muItipath environments. Diversity schemes are
   viewed as a method to alleviate the muItipath fading phenomenon and to
   enhance signal detection and parameter estimation performance by
   providing additional processing gain. In this paper, the performance of
   a weighted diversity combining method for the spatial antenna diversity
   system is analyzed and compared with the equal gain combining method.
   The combining methods are performed at two different levels namely the
   correlator output and the measurement level. The performance of the
   proposed method is empirically tested with live GPS L1 signal in a harsh
   indoor environment. Detection performance is assessed through a
   comparison of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. The
   parameter estimation accuracies are compared by analyzing the
   differential pseudorange standard deviation. Accuracy of the local level
   position solution is also evaluated to investigate the performance at
   the navigation level. It is shown that the accuracy of positioning by
   the proposed weighted combining method utilizing the spatial diversity
   is significantly improved compared to the individual diversity branches.}},

Abstract = {{The electrodeposition of nanostructured composite coatings involves the
   co-deposition of nano-sized oxide particles such as TiO2, Al2O3 and Y2O3
   into a corrosion resistant metal matrix such as nickel to improve the
   high temperature oxidation and erosion resistance of nickel coatings.
   The technique has several advantages over other methods for producing
   nanostructured composite coatings such as thermal metal spraying. Some
   of the main advantages are lower cost for equipment setup and lower
   material cost and the ease with which the process can be controlled.
   Although electrodeposited nanostructured coatings are being developed
   for various aerospace and marine applications, they have not yet been
   considered for protecting surfaces of components and piping that is used
   in technologies for the oil sands industry such as the In-Situ
   Combustion (ISC) process. The challenge with in-situ combustion oil
   production is that the combination of high temperature combustion gases
   and the presence of moving sand particles create an extremely severe
   environment in which high oxidation and erosion rates are expected. As a
   result there is a need to develop function specific coatings that can
   withstand both high temperatures and erosive environments in the oil
   sands industry.
   This paper presents results of high temperature oxidation behaviour of
   nickel coatings containing two types of nano-sized oxide dispersions
   (TiO2 and Al2O3). High temperature oxidation tests were conducted in dry
   air for 500 degrees C and 700 degrees C. The oxidized specimens were
   examined by metallographic surface analysis and surface composition
   techniques such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Wavelength
   Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (WDS). The effects of nano-sized oxide
   particles on high temperature oxidation behavior of nickel coatings have
   been studied. The results show an improvement in the high temperature
   oxidation resistance of nickel coatings dispersed with Al2O3 and TiO2.}},

   calculation of saturation pressure , e.g.bubble poing pressure (Pb) ,
   using EOS and iterative methods , is initial value to start the
   iteration . In thies work a feed forward multilayer neural network model
   is introduced to predict an initial value for bubble-point pressure in
   order to start the iterative methods. the model was developed using 411
   published data from middle east and canada fields. 76 percent of data
   was used to train network 10 percent to cross validate of developed
   relationship during training process, 14 percent to test and trend
   analysis of the model. the results show that the model predicts a bubble

Abstract = {{Tight gas reservoirs are categorized as unconventional gas reservoirs.
   One of the main characteristics of a tight gas reservoir is the
   adsorption of gas on the rock surface due to high specific surface area.
   Desorption is the process of adsorbing gas by the reservoir rock on its
   surface that is dependent on factors, such as reservoir pressure,
   reservoir rock type, and temperature. Therefore, analysis of production
   data using conventional methods is expected to be problematic. In this
   study, there was an endeavor to model and simulate the desorption
   phenomena in tight formations to investigate its effect on different
   properties and to study related reservoirs. The purpose of this work is
   to model the single-phase radial gas flow in tight gas reservoirs
   including equilibrium desorption phenomena on the rock surface and Darcy
   flow in a reservoir Considering a control volume, the gas desorption
   rate as a function of time and space is incorporated into the radial
   continuity equation as a source term. Using a Langmuir-type sorption
   isotherm, the gas desorption rate is determined at any radius of the
   reservoir The resulting governing equation is solved numerically using a
   finite difference approach. The simulator is used to model a tight
   reservoir to identify how important parameters affect the performance of
   a tight gas reservoir The results suggest that the development of tight
   gas reservoirs with significant gas desorption can lead to higher
   production rates and improve the productivity of the gas reservoir The
   model developed here can be used as an engineering tool for evaluating
   the role of adsorbed gases in improving the productivity and extending
   the life of tight gas reservoirs.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive computer modeling has been performed in the recent decade to
   investigate the mechanical response of the healthy and repaired knee
   joints. Articular cartilages and menisci have been commonly modeled as
   single-phase elastic materials in the previous 3D simulations. A
   comprehensive study considering the interplay of the collagen fibers and
   fluid pressurization in the tissues in situ remains challenging. We have
   developed a 3D model of the human knee accounting for the mechanical
   function of collagen fibers and fluid flow in the cartilages and
   menisci. An anatomically accurate structure of the human knee was used
   for this purpose including bones, articular cartilages, menisci and
   ligaments. The fluid pressurization in the femoral cartilage and menisci
   under combined creep loading was investigated. Numerical results showed
   that fluid flow and pressure in the tissues played an important role in
   the mechanical response of the knee joint. The load transfer in the
   joint was clearly seen when the fluid pressure was considered.}},

Abstract = {{In research on machining feature recognition, the problems of
   interacting features and availability of cutting tools are considered
   two major obstacles for developing industrial applications. In this
   research, a new machining feature recognition approach is developed to
   address these problems. In this work, a new concept called cutting mode
   is introduced to associate generic machining surfaces and cutting
   motions. In the feature recognition process, the machining surfaces of a
   part are first mapped to cutting modes, and these cutting modes are
   further mapped to available cutting tools. Among all the created
   candidate machining processes, heuristic rules are employed to identify
   the optimal solution that requires the minimum number of setups. When a
   number of machining surfaces are associated with a cutting tool in the
   same setup, these surfaces are grouped as a machining feature. Therefore
   the interacting features are recognised by the different cutting tools
   to produce these features. A database of available cutting tools is used
   to avoid the identification of features which cannot be machined in a
   machine shop. Three mechanical parts with interacting features are
   selected in the case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   developed approach.}},

Abstract = {{The human anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a composite structure of
   two anatomically distinct bundles: an anteromedial (AM) and
   posterolateral (PL) bundles. Tendons are often used as autografts for
   surgical reconstruction of ACL following severe injury. However, despite
   successful surgical reconstruction, some people experience re-rupture
   and later development of osteoarthritis. Understanding the structure and
   molecular makeup of normal ACL is essential for its optimal replacement.
   Reportedly the two bundles display different tensions throughout joint
   motion and may be fundamentally different. This study assessed the
   similarities and differences in ultrastructure and molecular composition
   of the AM and PL bundles to test the hypothesis that the two bundles of
   the ACL develop unique characteristics with maturation. ACLs from nine
   mature and six immature sheep were compared. The bundles were examined
   for mRNA and protein levels of collagen types I, III, V, and VI, and two
   proteoglycans. The fibril diameter composition of the two bundles was
   examined with transmission electron microscopy. Maturation does alter
   the molecular and structural composition of the two bundles of ACL.
   Although the PL band appears to mature slower than the AM band, no
   significant differences were detected between the bundles in the mature
   animals. We thus reject our hypothesis that the two ACL bundles are
   distinct. The two anatomically distinct bundles of the sheep ACL can be
   considered as two parts of one structure at maturity and material that
   would result in a structure of similar functionality can be used to
   replace each ACL bundle in the sheep.}},

Abstract = {{Suitable methods have to be employed for secondary and tertiary oil

   evaluate the technical issues of the miscible gas injection in NFRs. The
   classification of NFRs and their production characteristics, the
   mechanisms of oil production in NFRs, and significant findings of
   integrated studies, pilot and field trials, and commercial field
   projects of the miscible gas injection in NFRs are reviewed. Finally,
   important issues are identified, which need detailed investigations for

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new predistortion linearization technique based on
   the memory polynomial model of the power amplifier (PA) and a multi-bit
   delta-sigma modulator (DSM), in order to avoid reverse modeling and the
   associated instability problems. In this topology, a multi-bit DSM is
   utilized as a digital predistorter by locating the forward model of the
   PA in its feedback path. The technique has two main advantages. First,
   it applies the forward model instead of the reverse model of the PA,
   which leads to less implementation complexity and, therefore, greater
   robustness against instability. Second, using a dynamic model instead of
   a static model makes it more applicable for the linearization of
   wideband signals, due to the compensation for memory effects. To justify
   its advantages, linearizers based on both static and dynamic models have
   been designed and tested. For a 4 MHz WiMAX signal, the measurement
   results show an improvement of 17.2 dB in the signal-to-noise and
   distortion ratio (SNDR) by using a dynamic polynomial model, compared to
   an improvement of 13 dB for a static model. (C) 2012 Published by

Pages = {{3382-3394}},
Abstract = {{A complex product often requires a high machining precision. This is
   often achieved by a close-loop machining process to be carried out in
   several stages, and the measurements, fixture adjustments, and feedback
   or feed-forward control are inserted after each of these stages. The
   Complex Product Machining Process (CPMP) Capability Index (CPMPCI) is
   affected by the control and adjustments in a CPMP, and hence the
   calculation results of CPMPCI can be used as references to select a
   proper CPMP. In this paper, we present a novel calculation method of
   CPMPCI as quality control and improvement technology in a CPMP. A linear
   model is proposed for describing the variation propagation effect
   throughout all stages in a CPMP, and an observation model with the
   pre-specified control and adjustment strategy is employed to calculate
   the process mean and variation during a CPMP. Finally, through
   application of Taguchi's quality loss function, the CPMPCI calculation
   method is derived. The feasibility and effectiveness of this method are
   validated by a case study on a three-stage CPMP.}},

Abstract = {{Hyperspectral band image selection is a fundamental problem for
   hyperspectral remote sensing data processing. Accepting its importance,
   several information-based band selection methods have been proposed,
   which apply Shannon entropy to measure image information. However, the
   Shannon entropy is not accurate in measuring image information since it
   neglects the spatial distribution of pixels and is computed only from a
   histogram. This paper investigates the potential of spatial entropy in
   measuring image information and proposes a new mutual information (MI)
   band selection method based on the spatial entropy. Then selected band
   images are validated for supervised classification via Support Vector
   Machine (SVM). Using a hyperspectral AVIRIS 92AV3C dataset, experiment
   results show that with 20 images selection from 220 bands, the
   supervised classification accuracy can reach 90.6\%. Comparison with a
   previous Shannon entropy-based band selection method shows that the
   proposed method selects band images which can achieve more accurate
   classification results.}},

Abstract = {{The Facility Location Problem is an important research topic in spatial
   analysis. This paper focuses on the Static and Mobile Facility Location
   (SMFL) Problem, which aims to identify those static and mobile facility
   locations that serve a target area most efficiently and equally. This
   paper formalizes the SMFL problem as a bi-objective model and then
   solves the model by using a novel heuristic algorithm, named Static and
   Mobile Facility Location Searching (SMFLS). The algorithm consists of
   two steps: static facility location searching and mobile facility
   location searching. In order to solve the model for large datasets
   efficiently, a clustering-based heuristic method is proposed for the
   static facility location searching while the mobile facility location
   searching is implemented using a greedy heuristic method. Experiments on
   synthetic datasets demonstrate the efficiency of the SMFLS algorithm. In
   addition, with the aim of conducting facility location decision-making
   conveniently and efficiently, in this paper, an interactive geospatial
   analysis platform, named Geospatial Analysis Platform using Interactive
   Maps (GAPIM) is proposed by combining the bi-objective models and the
   SMFLS algorithm with an interactive map. Experiments on Alberta public

   (STS) with a new modified velocity model. Experimental studies on 8
   benchmark functions demonstrate that the HPSO holds good performance in
   solving both unimodal and multimodal functions optimization problems.}},

Abstract = {{We first analyze a stabilized finite volume method for the
   three-dimensional stationary Navier-Stokes equations. This method is
   based on local polynomial pressure projection using low order elements
   that do not satisfy the inf-sup condition. Then we derive a general
   superconvergent result for the stabilized finite volume approximation of
   the stationary Navier-Stokes equations by using a L-2-projection. The
   method is a postprocessing procedure that constructs a new approximation
   by using the method of least squares. The superconvergent results have
   three prominent features. First, they are established for any
   quasi-uniform mesh. Second, they are derived on the basis of the domain
   and the solution for the stationary Navier-Stokes problem by solving
   sparse, symmetric positive definite systems of linear algebraic
   equations. Third, they are obtained for the finite elements that fail to
   satisfy the inf-sup condition for incompressible flow. Therefore, this
   method presented here is of practical importance in scientific
   computation.}},

Abstract = {{We present a method using statistical measures of the orientation of
   texture to characterize and detect architectural distortion in prior
   mammograms of interval-cancer cases. Based on the orientation field,
   obtained by the application of a bank of Gabor filters to mammographic
   images, two types of co-occurrence matrices were derived to estimate the
   joint occurrence of the angles of oriented structures. For each of the
   matrices, Haralick's 14 texture features were computed. From a total of
   106 prior mammograms of 56 interval-cancer cases and 52 mammograms of 13
   normal cases, 4,224 regions of interest (ROIs) were automatically
   obtained by applying Gabor filters and phase portrait analysis. For each
   ROI, statistical features were computed using the angle co-occurrence
   matrices. The performance of the features in the detection of
   architectural distortion was analyzed and compared with that of
   Haralick's features computed using the gray-level co-occurrence matrices
   of the ROIs. Using logistic regression for feature selection, an
   artificial neural network for classification, and the
   leave-one-image-out approach for cross-validation, the best result
   achieved was 0.77 in terms of the area under the receiver operating
   characteristic (ROC) curve. Analysis of the free-response ROC curve
   yielded a sensitivity of 80\% at 5.4 false positives per image.}},

Abstract = {{The properties of terahertz (THz) radiation are well known. They
   penetrate well most non-conducting media; there are no known biological
   hazards, and atmospheric attenuation and scattering is lower than visual
   and IR radiation. Thus THz imaging is very attractive for homeland
   security, biological, space, and industrial applications. In the other
   hand, the resolution of MMW images is lower comparing to IR and visual
   due to longer wavelength. Furthermore, the diffraction effects are more
   noticeable in THz and MMW imaging systems. Thus the MMW images are
   blurred and unclear and thus it is difficult to see the details and
   small objects. In recent experimental work with 8X8 Glow Discharge
   Detector (GDD) Focal Plane Array (FPA) we were able to improve the
   resolution of MMW images by using oversampling methods with basic DSP
   algorithms.
   In this work a super resolution method with basic DSP algorithms will be
   demonstrated using the 2X18 double row camera. MMW images with sub
   wavelength resolution will be shown using those methods and small
   details and small objects will be observed.}},

   Cell Differentiation}},
Journal = {{CELLS TISSUES ORGANS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{196}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{34-47}},
Abstract = {{Due to their ability to differentiate into cell types from all the three
   germ layers and their potential unlimited capacity for expansion,
   embryonic stem cells have tremendous potential to treat diseases and
   injuries. Spontaneous differentiation of human embryonic stem cells
   (hESCs) is influenced by the size of the differentiating embryoid bodies
   (EBs). To further understand the dynamics between nutrient mass
   transfer, EB size, and stem cell differentiation, a transient mass
   diffusion model of a single hESC EB was constructed. The results
   revealed that the oxygen concentration at the centers of large EBs
   (400-mu m radius) was 50\% lower when compared to that in smaller EBs
   (200-mu m radius). In addition, the concentration profile of cytokines
   within an EB depended strongly on their depletion rate, with higher
   depletion rates resulting in cytokine concentrations that varied
   significantly throughout the EB. A comparison of the results of our
   model with published experimental data reveals a close correlation
   between the fraction of cells that differentiate to a given lineage and
   the fraction of cells exposed to different oxygen or cytokine
   concentrations. This, along with other data from the literature,
   suggests that diffusive mass transfer influences the differentiation of
   hESCs within EBs by controlling the spatial distribution of soluble
   factors. This has important implications for research involving the
   differentiation of embryonic stem cells in EBs, as well as for
   bioprocess design and the development of robust differentiation
   protocols where mass transfer could be altered to control the cell
   differentiation trajectory. Copyright (C) 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

Abstract = {{Coke formation from heavy oil has been extensively studied, and various
   kinetic models have been proposed in the literature. In this study,
   thermal behavior of crude oil and its asphaltene obtained from the
   Fosterton field was investigated using thermogravimetric analysis.
   Non-isothermal pyrolysis experiments of whole oil and its asphaltene
   were performed in nitrogen atmosphere at different heating rates of 5,
   10, 15, and 20 degrees C/min. Although much difference was observed in
   the weight loss profile for whole oil and its asphaltene, the final
   amount of coke formed changed with the heating rate. The non-isothermal
   pyrolysis kinetics of whole oil and its asphaltene was studied with the
   distributed activation energy model ( DAEM). Non-isothermal experiments
   were better described by the DAEM compared to other applicable models.
   The activation energy for whole oil pyrolysis spread over a range of 7
   to 129 kJ/mol, and the pre-exponential factor varied from 10(2) to
   10(11) min(-1). The asphaltene fraction separated from the oil had
   activation energy between 50 and 183 kJ/mol, and the pre-exponential
   factor ranged from 10(7) to 10(14) min(-1). Results from the kinetic
   analysis show that asphaltene has higher activation energy than whole
   oil.}},

Title = {{Spatial Characterization of GNSS Multipath Channels}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{There is a growing interest in detecting and processing Global
   Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals in indoors and urban canyons
   by handheld devices. To overcome the signal attenuation problem in such
   adverse fading environments, long coherent integration is normally used.
   Moving the antenna arbitrarily while collecting signals is generally
   avoided as it temporally decorrelates the signals and limits the
   coherent integration gain. This decorrelation is a function of the
   antenna displacement and geometry of reflectors and angle of arrival of
   the received signal. Hence, to have an optimum receiver processing
   strategy it is crucial to characterize the multipath fading channel
   parameters. Herein, Angle of Arrival (AoA) and Angle Spread (AS) along
   with signal spatial correlation coefficient and fading intensity in GNSS
   multipath indoor channels are defined and quantified theoretically and
   practically. A synthetic uniform circular array utilizing a right-hand
   circular polarized (RHCP) antenna has been used to measure the spatial
   characteristics of indoor GNSS fading channels. Furthermore, rotating
   effect of a circular polarized antenna on the synthetic array processing
   and AoA estimation has been characterized. The performance of the
   beamforming technique via array gain is also assessed to explore the
   advantages and limitations of beamforming in fading conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, an efficient Bayesian meta-modeling approach is

   Different prior densities and particularly, a non informative hyper
   prior have been employed on the parameters involved in the correlation

   expectation-maximization algorithm. Compared with the recent work of Li
   and Sudjianto (2005), the proposed approach is not only of higher
   prediction accuracy but also of lower computational cost, due to the
   utilization of the non informative prior and the absence of tuning
   parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach yields
   state-of-the-art performance.}},

Title = {{Gender differences in activity participation, time-of-day and duration
   choices: new evidence from Calgary}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{35}},

Pages = {{175-190}},
Abstract = {{To date only limited research has quantified differences between female
   and male activity patterns, and analyses at an individual activity level
   are scarce. Past research has focused on investigating gender
   differences in mobility levels based on observed travel patterns,
   especially those related to commuting. This article reports new evidence
   based on analyses of a household activity survey data-set collected from
   a Canadian city - Calgary - in 2001. Results show that contemporary
   females and males have a very similar activity participation pattern. On
   the other hand, analyses applied to activity starting times support the
   view that there are minor gender differences in time-of-day choices. In
   addition, duration and survival analyses through log-rank and Wilcoxon
   tests show that women and men tend to spend more or less time on some of
   the 10 weekend/weekday activities, and thus indicate that they share
   different domestic and societal responsibilities: males tend to spend
   longer time for out-of-home activities, such as work, school, social,
   and out-of-town; whereas females contribute more to domestic work,
   including shopping, eating, and religious activity. In general, this
   article contributes new evidence to gender differences in activity
   participation, time-of-day, and duration choices at the individual
   activity level. Such differences may influence travelers' time, mode,
   and location choices and thus have important implications for the
   complexity of an activity-based modeling framework. These implications
   are discussed along with recommendations for incorporating gender
   differences in an activity-based modeling framework.}},

Title = {{Use of a thermal imager for snow pit temperatures}},
Journal = {{CRYOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{287-299}},
Abstract = {{Weak snow of interest to avalanche forecasting often forms and changes
   as thin layers. Thermometers, the current field technology for measuring
   the temperature gradients across such layers - and for thus estimating
   the expected vapour flux and future type of crystal metamorphism - are
   difficult to use at distances shorter than 1 cm. In contrast, a thermal
   imager can provide thousands of simultaneous temperature measurements
   across small distances with better accuracy. However, a thermal imager
   only senses the exposed surface, complicating its methods for access and
   accuracy of buried temperatures. This paper presents methods for
   exposing buried layers on pit walls and using a thermal imager to
   measure temperatures on these walls, correct for lens effects with snow,
   adjust temperature gradients, adjust time exposed, and calculate
   temperature gradients over millimetre distances. We find lens error on
   temperature gradients to be on the order of 0.03 A degrees C between
   image centre and corners. We find temperature gradient change over time
   to usually decrease - as expected with atmospheric equalization as a
   strong effect. Case studies including thermal images and visual macro
   photographs of crystals, collected during the 2010-2011 winter,
   demonstrate large temperature differences over millimetre-scale
   distances that are consistent with observed kinetic metamorphism.
   Further study is needed to use absolute temperatures independently of
   supporting gradient data.}},

Abstract = {{The propagation saw test (PST) is a recently developed snowpack test

   accuracy of the standard PST method at validated sites of observed
   weak-layer fracture initiation, with or without propagation. We also
   report on experiments with alternative test methods and varying saw
   thicknesses. Results show the standard PST method is comparably accurate
   to other common snowpack tests in predictive skill when predicting
   propagation propensity on the slope scale. Although a slight but
   significant dependence on saw thickness was found, it did not affect the
   interpretation in our validation study. Alternative methods such as
   scaling the test column length with weak-layer depth or leaving the
   upslope end of the column attached to the surrounding snowpack did not
   improve slope-scale accuracy and these tests were often more difficult

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{50}},

Pages = {{1009-1027}},
Abstract = {{Setup/fixture planning for machining prismatic parts is usually carried
   out by grouping features/operations into setups, determining suitable
   locating surfaces for each setup, and sequencing setups and operations
   in each setup. The presently developed setup/fixture planning methods
   can be classified into three categories: multi-constraints, fixture
   driven, and tolerance analysis planning methods. The multi-constraints
   planning is theoretically sound, but very difficult to use. In fixture
   driven planning, the generated setup plans are highly practical, but may
   not be optimal. Tolerance analysis based planning cannot be used to
   generate the optimal solution by itself. In this research, a new
   integrated setup/fixture planning approach is developed to identify the
   optimal and practical setup/fixture plan. The planning is conducted in
   four steps. (1) The dissimilarity degree matrix (DDM), operation
   precedence graph (OPG), and hybrid graph are used to describe the
   requirements and constraints for setup/fixture planning. (2) A setup
   precedence graph (SPG) is used to describe precedence constraints
   between setups. The SPG is generated by the vertex clustering algorithm.
   Precedence loops among setups are avoided by checking whether two serial
   vertex clusters can generate a loop. (3) Suitable locating surfaces are
   selected for each setup in a SPG. When the fixture locating surface and
   design datum surface are different, two types of dimension
   recalculations are employed to obtain the dimensions against the
   locating surfaces. (4) All the candidate setup/fixture plans are
   evaluated based on the number of setups and recalculation of dimensions.
   An example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{This research introduces a robust design approach using engineering
   models described by implicit mathematical functions. In this paper, the
   scheme to describe the engineering models using implicit functions is
   explained first. The relationships between product functional
   performance variations and design parameters are then derived from these
   implicit functions. An optimal robust design model is subsequently
   introduced to minimize functional performance variation. A case study is
   given to illustrate the effectiveness of the robust design approach with
   engineering models described by implicit mathematical functions.}},

   GNSS Applications}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION}},

Abstract = {{Multipath fading in the form of signal power fluctuation poses a
   formidable challenge to GNSS signal detection in harsh multipath
   environments such as indoors. Antenna diversity techniques such as
   polarization and spatial diversities can be used to combat multipath
   fading in wireless propagation channels. This paper studies and compares
   GPS signal detection performance enhancements arising from the spatial
   and polarization diversity techniques. Performance enhancements are
   quantified from a theoretical perspective and later verified based on
   several test measurements in various indoor environments. Enhancement is
   quantified based on measuring the correlation coefficient values between
   diversity branches, SNR levels, and computing the level crossing rate
   and average fade duration. In addition, the processing gain is
   quantified and the performance of each individual diversity system is
   evaluated. Experimental results show that, for a given target detection
   performance in terms of the probability of false alarm and the
   probability of detection, the required input SNR level to meet the
   target detection performance can be significantly reduced utilizing the
   diversity system.}},

Abstract = {{Orthopaedic residents typically learn to perform total knee arthroplasty
   (TKA) through an apprenticeship-type model, which is a necessarily slow
   process. Surgical skills courses, using artificial bones, have been
   shown to improve technical and cognitive skills significantly within a
   couple of days. The addition of computer-assisted surgery (CAS)
   simulations challenges the participants to consider the same task in a
   different context, promoting cognitive flexibility. We designed a
   hands-on educational intervention for junior residents with a
   conventional tibiofemoral TKA station, two different tibiofemoral CAS
   stations, and a CAS and conventional patellar resection station,
   including both qualitative and quantitative analyses. Qualitatively,
   structured interviews before and after the course were analyzed for
   recurring themes. Quantitatively, subjects were evaluated on their
   technical skills before and after the course, and on a multiple-choice
   knowledge test and error detection test after the course, in comparison
   to senior residents who performed only the testing. Four themes emerged:
   confidence, awareness, deepening knowledge and changed perspectives. The
   residents' attitudes to CAS changed from negative before the course to
   neutral or positive afterwards. The junior resident group completed 23\%
   of tasks in the pre-course skills test and 75\% of tasks on the
   post-test (p < 0.01), compared to 45\% of tasks completed by the senior
   resident group. High-impact educational interventions, promoting
   cognitive flexibility, would benefit trainees, attending surgeons, the
   healthcare system and patients.}},

   Growth Hormone Treatment in a Mouse Model of Growth Hormone Deficiency}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{Growth hormone (GH) deficiency is related to an increased fracture risk
   although it is not clear if this is due to compromised bone quality or a
   small bone size. We investigated the relationship between bone
   macrostructure, microarchitecture and mechanical properties in a
   GH-deficient (GHD) mouse model undergoing GH treatment commencing at an
   early (prepubertal) or late (postpubertal) time point. Microcomputed
   tomography images of the femur and L4 vertebra were obtained to quantify
   macrostructure and vertebral trabecular microarchitecture, and
   mechanical properties were determined using finite element analyses. In
   the GHD animals, bone macrostructure was 25 to 43\% smaller as compared
   to the GH-sufficient (GHS) controls (P < 0.001). GHD animals had 20\%
   and 19\% reductions in bone volume ratio (BV/TV) and trabecular
   thickness (Tb.Th), respectively. Whole bone mechanical properties of the
   GHD mice were lower at the femur and vertebra (67\% and 45\% resp.) than
   the GHS controls (P < 0.001). Both early and late GH treatment partially
   recovered the bonemacrostructure (15 to 32\% smaller than GHS controls)
   and the whole bone mechanical properties (24 to 43\% larger than GHD
   animals) although there remained a sustained 27-52\% net deficit
   compared to normal mice (P < 0.05). Importantly, early treatment with GH
   led to a recovery of BV/TV and Tb.Th with a concomitant improvement of
   trabecular mechanical properties. Therefore, the results suggest that GH
   treatment should start early, and that measurements of microarchitecture
   should be considered in the management of GHD.}},

Abstract = {{Detecting building changes followed by updates is preferable for
   efficient revisions to building models. Additionally, more change types
   can be detected with spatial information provided by building models for

   detection scheme with new light detection and ranging (LIDAR) point
   clouds, new aerial images and existing building models. By integrating
   the spatial information from LIDAR data and image-based spectral
   information, this work identifies changes to existing buildings and
   identifies newly built and changed buildings. To provide an initial
   value for further revisions, new building regions are generated from
   change detection results. Experimental results demonstrate that the
   proposed scheme has high accuracy for both change type determination and
   building region generation. To provide comprehensive observations,
   experimental results deemed unreliable are scrutinized.}},

Pages = {{1349-1359}},
Abstract = {{As the number of satellite-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems
   increases, both the availability and the length of multi-temporal (MT)
   sequences of SAR images have also increased. Previous research on MT SAR
   sequences suggests that they increase the classification accuracy for
   all applications over single date images. Yet the presence of speckle
   noise remains a problem and all images in the sequence must be speckle
   filtered before acceptable classification accuracy can be attained.
   Several speckle filters designed specifically for MT sequences have been
   reported in the literature. Filtering in the spatial domain, as is
   usually done, reduces the effective spatial resolution of the filtered
   image. MT speckle filters operate in both the spatial and temporal
   dimensions, thus the reduction in resolution is not likely to be as
   severe (although a comparison between MT and spatial filters has not
   been reported). While this advantage may be useful when extracting
   spatial features from the image sequence, it is not quite as apparent
   for classification applications. This research explores the relative
   performance of spatial and MT speckle filtering for a particular
   classification application: mapping boreal forest types. We report
   filter performance using the radiometric resolution as measured by the
   equivalent number of looks (NL), and classification performance as
   measured by the classification accuracy. We chose representative spatial
   and MT filters and found that spatial speckle filters offer the
   advantage of higher radiometric resolution and higher classification
   accuracy with lower algorithm complexity. Thus, we confirm that MT
   filtering offers no advantage for classification applications; spatial
   speckle filters yield higher overall performance.}},

   An experimental program was conducted to explore the factors affecting

   the concrete compressive strength, bottom/top reinforcement ratio, shear
   strength, and shear demand. The increase in concrete strength did not
   influence the plastic hinge length, which was increased significantly by
   the effect of shear spread. The shear spread depended on the shear

Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},

Pages = {{1-13}},
Abstract = {{In this article, we investigate experimentally the suitability of
   several Bayesian filtering techniques for the problem of tracking a
   moving device by a set of wireless sensor nodes in indoor environments.
   In particular, we consider a setup where a robot was equipped with an
   ultra-wideband (UWB) node emitting ranging signals; this information was
   captured by a network of static UWB sensor nodes that were in charge of
   range computation. With the latter, we ran, analyzed, and compared
   filtering techniques to track the robot. Namely, we considered methods
   falling into two families: Gaussian filters and particle filters.
   Results shown in the article are with real data and correspond to an
   experimental setup where the wireless sensor network was deployed.
   Additionally, statistical analysis of the real data is provided,
   reinforcing the idea that in this kind of ranging measurements, the
   Gaussian noise assumption does not hold. The article also highlights the
   robustness of a particular filter, namely the cost-reference particle
   filter, to model inaccuracies which are typical in any practical
   filtering algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{The determination, monitoring and understanding of sea level change at
   various spatial and temporal scales has been the focus of many studies
   during the past decades. The advent of satellite altimetry and the
   multitude of unprecedented in accuracy and resolution observations that
   it offers allowed, in combination with tide gauge data, precise
   determinations of sea level variations. The realization of the GRACE
   mission and the forthcoming GOCE data offer new opportunities for the
   estimation of sea level trends at regional and global scales and the
   identification of seasonal signals. In such studies, even though the
   data combination and processing strategies have been carried out
   carefully with proper control, a point that has been given little
   attention is error propagation and variance component estimation of the
   data variance-covariance matrices. The latter two are of significant
   importance in heterogeneous data combination studies, since on one hand
   error propagation can provide reliable estimates of the output signal
   error while variance component estimation allows for a rigorous control
   of the data covariance matrices and subsequent sound decisions on
   statistical testing of hypotheses involving least-squares residuals and
   the estimated deterministic parameters. This work presents some new
   ideas towards the estimation of sea level change through the combination
   of altimetric, tide gauge, atmospheric, and GRACE- and GOCE-type
   observables. The combination scheme is based on a hybrid deterministic
   and stochastic treatment of the data errors and an estimation of sea
   level changes through least-squares collocation with considerations for
   glacial isostatic adjustment and continental water outpour effects. The
   deterministic model parameters treat datum and geophysical correction
   model inconsistencies in the data used, while the stochastic part allows
   for a simultaneous determination of stochastic parameters included in
   the data in terms of residual signals. Within this mixed adjustment
   scheme with stochastic parameters, variance component estimation is
   carried out using the iterative almost unbiased estimator method. The
   analytical equations for the prediction of the adjusted input and output
   signals are presented along with possible modifications of the
   observation equation for the determination of solely steric and
   atmospheric-driven sea level changes.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The major hurdle for three-dimensional display of lung lobes is
   the automatic recognition of lobar fissures, boundaries of lung lobes.
   Lobar fissures are difficult to recognize due to their variable shape
   and appearance, along with the low contrast and high noise inherent in
   computed tomographic (CT) images. An algorithm for recognizing the major
   fissures in human lungs was developed and tested.
   Methods The algorithm employs texture analysis and fissure appearance to
   mimic the way that surgeons/radiologists read CT images in clinical
   settings. The algorithm uses 3 stages to automatically find the major
   fissures in human lungs: (a) texture analysis, (b) fissure region
   analysis, and (c) fissure identification.
   Results The algorithm's feasibility was evaluated using isotropic CT
   images from 16 anonymous patients with varying pathologies. Compared
   with manual segmentation, the algorithm yielded mean distances of 1.92
   +/- 2.07 and 2.07 +/- 2.37 mm, for recognizing the left and right major
   fissures, respectively.
   Conclusions An automatic recognition algorithm for major fissures in
   human lungs is feasible, providing a foundation for the future
   development of a complete segmentation algorithm for lung lobes.}},

Abstract = {{The volume of heavy oil and bitumen in the oil-sands deposits in western
   Canada is similar to that of conventional crude oil in the Middle East.
   This resource is immense but is difficult and energy intensive to
   extract because the viscosity of the oil is high, typically greater than
   100,000 to 1,000,000+ cp at original reservoir conditions. Current
   commercial thermal-recovery processes used include steam-assisted
   gravity drainage (SAGD) and cyclic steam stimulation (CSS). These
   methods are energy intensive, emit significant amounts of CO, into the
   atmosphere, and use large volumes of water to recover the oil. In this
   work, the focus is on SAGD processes. It has been demonstrated that
   operating strategy can be altered to improve SAGD performance, but it is
   not clear how well configuration can be changed to improve recovery,
   energy intensity, thermal efficiency, water use, and flue-gas emissions.
   This paper examines the impact of position and geometry of steam
   injectors on the performance of steam-based gravity-drainage processes
   in a heterogeneous reservoir. Different injection-well configurations
   including single horizontal (typical SAGD), offset SAGD, and
   vertical/horizontal well combinations have been evaluated by using a
   detailed, 3D, geostatistically populated, large-scale thermal
   reservoir-simulation model derived from core-data examinations of the
   Dover pilot site. The research reveals how injection-well configuration
   impacts energy delivery to the reservoir, how it affects thermal
   efficiency, and how it changes the evolution of the steam-conformance
   zone and oil-flow dynamics in the reservoir. The results suggest that
   several vertical injectors have the potential to deliver steam more
   efficiently than a single horizontal injector.}},

Title = {{Foamy-Oil-Viscosity Measurement}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CANADIAN PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{60-65}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Foamy-oil viscosity is a controversial topic among researchers regarding
   what happens to the oil viscosity when the solution gas starts coming
   out of solution because of decreasing pressure and the released gas
   starts migrating with the oil in the form of dispersed gas bubbles. For
   conventional oils, below the true bubblepoint pressure, the oil
   viscosity increases as the gas freely evolves from the oil. For foamy
   oils, it has been suggested that the apparent oil viscosity remains
   relatively constant or perhaps declines slightly between the true
   bubblepoint and a characteristic lower pressure, called
   pseudobubblepoint, which is the pressure at which the gas starts
   separating from the oil. Below this pressure, the viscosity increases,
   reaching the dead-oil value at atmospheric pressure. However, it is a
   well-known fact in dispersion rheology that the viscosity of dispersion
   is higher than the viscosity of the continuous phase. Therefore, the
   concept of foamy-oil viscosity being lower than the oil viscosity is
   counterintuitive. It is likely that the apparent viscosity for flow of
   foamy oil in porous media is not the true dispersion viscosity because
   of the size of dispersed bubbles being comparable to the pore sizes.
   This study investigates this issue by measuring the foamy-oil viscosity
   under varied conditions. The effect of several parameters, such as flow
   rate, gas volume fraction, and type of viscometer employed, on foamy-oil
   viscosity was evaluated experimentally. Three different
   viscosity-measurement techniques, including Cambridge falling-needle
   viscometer, capillary tube, and a slimtube packed with sand, were used
   to measure the apparent viscosity of gas-in-oil dispersions. The results
   show that the type of measuring device used has a significant effect.
   The results obtained with Cambridge falling-needle viscometer correlate
   better with the observed behaviour in the sand-packed slimtube than the
   capillary viscometer results. Overall, the apparent viscosity of foamy
   oil was found to be similar to live-oil viscosity for a range of gas
   volume fractions.}},

Abstract = {{The Elbow River in southern Alberta, Canada is the source of the
   Glenmore reservoir, which provides drinking water to the City of
   Calgary. Due to the rapid population growth in Calgary, the Elbow River
   watershed (ERW) that covers about 1238 km(2) has been under considerable
   pressure for land-use development over the last decade. This study was
   undertaken to assess the impact of potential land-use changes over the
   next 20 years on the hydrological processes in ERW by combining a
   land-use cellular automata (CA) model and the distributed
   physically-based MIKE-SHE/MIKE-11 hydrological model. The CA model was
   calibrated using four land-use maps covering the period 1985-2001 and
   validated against the maps of 2006 and 2010. Simulations of land-use
   changes were then performed from 2006 to 2031 at a five year interval;
   land-use based parameters were extracted from the simulated maps and
   transferred to MIKE-SHE/MIKE-11. MIKE-SHE was calibrated for the period
   1985-1990 and validated for the period 2000-2005. The Nash and Sutcliffe
   coefficients of efficiency calculated between observed and simulated
   flow data for the calibration and validation periods are 0.56, 0.52,
   0.79, and 0.75 based on different hydrometric stations respectively,
   indicating an acceptable level of performance of the model. Land-use
   changes analyzed for the period 2001-2031 reveal a 65\% increase in
   built-up areas, 20\% in rangeland/parkland, and 1\% in agriculture along
   with a reduction of 28\% in deciduous, and 6\% in evergreen forest. As a
   result, the hydrological modeling indicates an increase of 7.3\% in
   overland flow, and a decrease of 1\%, 13.2\%, and 2.3\% in total
   evapotranspiration, baseflow, and infiltration respectively along with a
   decrease of the total flow by 4\%. These results reveal a potential
   significant negative impact on the sustainability of ground/surface
   water supplies and groundwater storages in the future in the watershed
   in addition to an increased risk of flashy floods. The study also
   revealed that due to the complex hydrological regime existing in the
   study area, a comprehensive physically-based method is required to
   better represent the interaction between groundwater and surface water.
   The combined CA/MIKE-SHE models appear as a useful tool to assess the
   impact of land-use changes on the hydrologic cycle and to better
   understand the connection among the hydrologic components in the Elbow
   River watershed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Compared with the traditional design to create multiple products for
   satisfying different requirements in different life-cycle time periods,
   adaptable design aims at creating a single product to satisfy these
   different requirements through adaptation of this product in its
   different life-cycle time periods. In this research, a method to
   identify the optimal adaptable product based on changeable requirements
   is introduced. The changeable requirements are described as functions of
   the life-cycle time parameter. The adaptable product, modeled by its
   configurations and parameters, is changed in different life-cycle time
   periods to satisfy the changeable requirements. An adaptable product is
   evaluated considering different time periods in its whole life-cycle.
   Among all possible design candidates, the optimal design is identified
   through optimization. A case study is conducted to show the
   effectiveness of the introduced method. (C) 2011 The Society of

Abstract = {{The reliability assessment of various grades of pipeline steel with
   corrosion defects was conducted through a finite element analysis (FEA)
   model. The failure pressure of pipelines was also evaluated by three
   industry models for comparison. Results demonstrate that the failure
   pressure of pipelines is reduced by the increasing corrosion depth and
   the decrease of the steel grade. Predictions by ASME B31G and the
   modified B31G models tend to be higher than FEA results for low grade
   steels, while the DNV model shows the close result to FEA. The
   predictive reliability by ASME B31G and the modified B31G decreases with
   the increases in corrosion depth and the steel grade. The geometry of
   corrosion defects affects remarkably the local stress and strain
   distributions, and plays a critical role in the failure pressure
   prediction. The applied strain in the longitudinal direction simulating
   the soil strain, regardless of tensile or compressive, would reduce the
   failure pressure of pipelines. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Improving classification accuracy of airborne LiDAR intensity data by

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{67}},

Abstract = {{Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) systems are used to measure
   the range (distance from the sensor to the target) and the intensity
   data (the backscattered energy from the target). LiDAR has been used
   extensively to model the topography of the Earth surface. Nowadays,
   LiDAR systems operating in the near-infrared spectral range are also
   gaining high interest for land cover classification and object
   recognition. LiDAR system requires geometric calibration (GC) and
   radiometric correction (RC) in order to maximize the benefit from the
   collected LiDAR data. This paper evaluates the impact of the GC and the
   RC of the LiDAR data on land cover classification. The procedure
   includes the use of a quasi-rigorous method for the GC and the radar
   (range) equation for the RC of the LiDAR data. The geometric calibration
   procedure is used to adjust the coordinates of the point cloud by
   removing the impact of biases in the system parameters as well as
   deriving corrected ranges and scan angles (in the absence of the
   system's raw measurements) for the RC process. The geometrically
   calibrated ranges and scan angles are then used to correct the intensity
   data from the atmospheric attenuation and background backscattering
   based on the radar (range) equation. The atmospheric attenuation, which
   has not been fully addressed in the previous literature, is modeled by
   considering the parameters of absorption as well as scattering derived
   from existing empirical models and public (free) molecular absorption
   database. A LiDAR dataset covering an urban area is used to evaluate the
   effect of the GC and RC of the LiDAR data on land cover classification.
   The results are evaluated using a true ortho-rectified aerial image
   acquired during the same flight mission. The classification results show
   an accuracy improvement of about 9.4-12.8\% for the LiDAR data used
   after the GC and RC. The study provides a practical approach for the
   LiDAR system GC and RC which can be implemented by most of the data end
   users. The outcome from this research work is a data processing tool
   that maximizes the benefits of using the intensity data for object
   recognition and land cover classification, which will be quite important
   for LiDAR data users. (C) 2011 International Society for Photogrammetry

Abstract = {{The electrochemical conversion of dry CH4 was studied over a Ni/YSZ and
   La0.3Sr0.7TiO3 bi-layer anode at 1023 K. In order to understand the
   electrochemical pathway, a fuel mixture composed of H-2, CH4, CO, and
   CO2 was fed to the SOFC anode while the gas products were analyzed at
   different current densities. In this fuel mixture, the Nernst potential
   and material balance, calculated from the H-2 electrochemical oxidation
   reaction, were consistent with the experimental OCV and the gas product
   analysis. In dry CH4 fuel, the electrochemical oxidation pathway is more
   complex. The conversion of dry CH4 strongly depends on the anode
   polarization. CO formed at low current densities (i < 0.1 A/cm(2)) from
   the electrochemical oxidation of carbon deposits, whereas H2O and CO2
   formed above this current density from the electrochemical oxidation of
   H-2 and CO. (C) 2012 The Electrochemical Society. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{The aim of the study was to assess healing after capsaicin-induced
   substance P (SP) depletion during rat Achilles tendon repair by
   biomechanical testing. Capsaicin treatment reduced the concentrations of
   SP by similar to 60\% and calcitonin gene-related peptide by similar to
   40\% as compared with the control group, as assessed by radioimmunoassay
   in the dorsal root ganglia, at 1 and 4 weeks post-tendon rupture. Also,
   the peripheral neuronal presence of SP and calcitonin gene-related
   peptide, as assessed by immunohistochemistry, was lower at both weeks 1
   and 4. The decreased peripheral neuronal presence of SP at week 1
   correlated with the corresponding levels in the dorsal root ganglia (r =
   0.54, p = 0.018). The reduced presence of SP/calcitonin gene-related
   peptide after capsaicin treatment was verified by a decreased
   sensitivity to painful mechanical and thermal stimuli (p < 0.05).
   Correlation analyses between individual residual SP levels and
   biomechanical tissue properties were performed because of differences in
   failure mode between the groups and high individual variations in the SP
   levels after capsaicin treatment. Thus, the residual SP levels in the
   dorsal root ganglia correlated with transverse area, ultimate tensile
   strength, and stress at failure (r = 0.39, p = 0.036; r = 0.53, p =
   0.005; and r = 0.43, p = 0.023, respectively). Furthermore, individual
   pain sensitivity at week 2 correlated with peripheral occurrence of SP
   and was correlated with tensile strength and stress at failure (r =
   0.89, p = 0.006 and r = 0.78, p = 0.015) at week 4.}},

Title = {{Wound healing differences between Yorkshire and red Duroc porcine medial
   collateral ligaments identified by biomechanical assessment of scars}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{91-98}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Currently, there are no large animal models to assess
   potential genetic contributions to ligament biomechanics during an
   injury repair response. Yorkshire and red Duroc pigs display
   phenotypically and genetically different skin wound healing responses;
   red Duroc skin scars were hyper-contracted and hyper-pigmented, whereas
   Yorkshire skin scars were not. Such findings raise the question whether
   connective tissues of synovial joints display a similar differential
   healing response in these pig breeds. This study assessed medial
   collateral ligament healing in Yorkshire and red Duroc pigs at the
   functional (biomechanical) level.
   Methods: Surgical injury was created in the right hind limb medial
   collateral ligament of Yorkshire and red Duroc pigs. After 10 weeks of
   healing, low-load (laxity and creep) and high-load (failure) mechanical
   properties were measured.
   Findings: Large, complete ligament scars formed by 10 weeks post-injury.
   A differential healing response was observed between the breeds, where
   red Duroc ligament scars had larger cross-sectional areas, exhibited
   greater static and total creep responses, failed at greater deformations
   and strains (P <= 0.05), and failed with strong trends for higher loads
   and lower moduli (P=0.06) than Yorkshire ligament scars.
   Interpretation: The ligament healing response of red Duroc pigs differs
   from Yorkshire pigs. Previously observed breed differences in dorsal
   skin wound healing are not restricted to skin. Such findings support a
   genetic basis for breed differences in response to connective tissue
   injury. Since this animal model is physiologically comparable to humans,
   these findings could provide further insight into identification of
   specific genetic contributions to ligament repair in human populations.

Abstract = {{A fast, reliable, and inexpensive way to monitor the quality of
   hydroprocessed products from a heavy bitumen distillate is presented in
   this work. Predictive models for density, nitrogen and sulfur contents,
   and weight percentage of lumped products, in this case, the distillation
   cuts IBP-235, 235-280, 280-343, and 343+ degrees C, were obtained
   through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and partial least
   squares regression (PLS-R). In addition, two structural parameters also
   derived from FTIR spectroscopy are proposed for chemical understanding
   of the former process. Two sets of hydroprocessing experimental runs
   were conducted under various operating conditions to evaluate the nature
   of the hydrocarbon (HC) products from two different catalysts. The
   statistic validation of the models demonstrated the capability to
   predict accurately physicochemical properties of a wide range
   distillation cut. Simplicity and accuracy make FTIR-PLS a promising tool
   for online estimation of process conversion as well as products
   properties at pilot scale and even in refinery facilities.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, an attempt is made 10 develop an eco-friendly and
   compact premixed liquified petroleum gas burner based on surface
   combustion in a porous inert medium. The premixing mechanism is the
   combination of a swirler and steel wire mesh packing. the preheating and
   reaction zones are made up of alumina (Al2O3) foams of pore sizes, 26
   and 8 ppcm. respectively. Experiments are conducted with 0.5 liters per
   minute of liquified petroleum gas fuel, which is found to be the minimum
   quantity required to produce a sustainable flame when mixed with 4
   liters per minute of aim; the mixture being highly fuel-rich. The
   combustion is facilitated by enough secondary (atmospheric) air to
   ensure complete combustion. the temperature distribution within the
   combustor; flame stability; maximum flame temperature; NO, CO, and SO2
   emissions; and combustion efficiency are measured and compared with
   those of a conventional domestic liquified petroleum gas stove. The fuel
   saving potential of the proposed burner is also evaluated. It is found
   that the proposed burner could yield an 80\% savings in fuel consumption
   and 75\% reduction in NOx emissions compared to the conventional one.
   The CO and SO2 emissions are also well within the global standards.}},

Abstract = {{Metastable kappa-Al2O3 was produced by thermal treatment of gamma-Al2O3

   Catalysts containing both low (5 wt.\%) and high (20 wt.\%) amounts of
   Ni were tested for activity towards toluene hydrogenation and
   characterized with X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed reduction,
   and transmission electron microscopy. In order to better understand the
   behaviours of these catalysts, total reducibility, surface oxide
   reducibility, metal dispersion, and number of adsorption sites were
   compared with catalytic activity. Of these factors, only surface oxide
   reducibility was directly correlated with activity - the more easily the
   surface oxide was reduced the more active the catalyst was. Catalytic
   activity increased in the following order:
   Ni5/gamma-Al2O3<Ni5/kappa-Al2O3<Ni20/kappa-Al2O3<Ni20/gamma-Al2O3. The
   number of metallic active sites is usually considered as a major factor
   to determine the corresponding activity, but in this study reducibility
   changes in surface Ni sites were more influential to the activity than
   the number of active sites.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS \& AUTOMATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-14}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a control algorithm to achieve hopping with a single
   rigid-link articulated leg with foot, robust to model uncertainty and
   bounded disturbances. A gait generator, based on previous work, supplies
   desired trajectories for the joints in flight and stance phases. In the
   underactuated flight phase, a gain-scheduled LQR control keeps the joint
   trajectories close to the pre-planned path. Due to uncertainties and
   disturbances, the touch-down configuration will not generally be known
   with certainty. In the stance phase a terminal sliding mode provides a
   path back to the desired trajectory. A finite-time control ensures the
   joints follow the terminal sliding mode. These methods avoid the
   reaching phase and discontinuous signals found in standard sliding
   modes. The proposed control achieves robustness while avoiding excessive
   torques and torque chatter. In simulation the robot achieves periodic
   hopping, which is robust to a significant unknown payload.}},

Abstract = {{The trend toward the miniaturization of parts has created a strong
   demand for the manufacturing of precision-molded miniature polymeric
   components, due to their high productivity and cost-effectiveness. The
   objective of this study is the investigation of the filling behavior and
   dimensional accuracy of thin microinjection-molded components using
   chemical blowing agents and wood fibers. In order to investigate the
   dimensional stability of the miniature molded parts, a micromold was
   designed and manufactured using a precision micromilling machine. The
   flow pattern of the thin molded components was experimentally
   investigated using different materials: pure linear low-density
   polyethylene (LLDPE), foamed LLDPE, and wood fiber LLDPE composite. The
   results indicate that viscosity significantly affects the flow patterns.
   Filling behavior of the molded parts was also investigated using
   commercial flow software. Dimensional accuracy and shrinkage of the
   molded parts were measured using various gauges. Controlling the cell
   size, cell density, and distribution of foamed parts was especially
   difficult for thin micro components; however, the results showed that
   use of chemical blowing agents can improve the flow ability of the thin
   components in the microinjection molding process. POLYM. ENG. SCI.,

Abstract = {{Digital circuits have grown exponentially in their sizes over the past
   decades. To be able to automate the design of these circuits, efficient
   algorithms are needed. One of the challenging stages of circuit design
   is the physical design where the physical locations of the components of
   a circuit are determined. Coarsening or clustering algorithms have
   become popular with physical designers due to their ability to reduce
   circuit sizes in the intermediate design steps such that the design can
   be performed faster and with higher quality. In this paper, a new
   clustering algorithm based on the algebraic multigrid (AMG) technique is
   presented. In the proposed algorithm, AMG is used to assign weights to
   connections between cells of a circuit and find cells that are best
   suited to become the initial cells for clusters, seed cells. The seed
   cells and the weights between them and the other cells are then used to
   cluster the cells of a circuit. The analysis of the proposed algorithm
   proves linear-time complexity, O(N), where N is the number of pins in a
   circuit. The numerical experiments demonstrate that AMG-based clustering
   can achieve high quality clusters and improve circuit placement designs
   with low computational cost. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Inadequate communication and non-availability of information have been
   widely observed in construction projects, causing low productivity and
   tool times of around 50\% in high-rise building construction projects.
   The use of information technology to overcome communication barriers has
   been extremely limited at the construction site level, as construction
   companies typically hesitate to adopt new technologies. However, workers
   have expressed their willingness and ability to use new technologies at
   the construction site level. By considering the views of all the
   relevant construction stakeholders - workers, managers and technology
   developers - a novel information technology based communication concept
   called the Information Booth was developed and was pilot tested in an
   actual construction project environment, improving the tool time,
   productivity and worker satisfaction. The Information Booth then evolved
   into the i-Booth (c) with many additional features, including virtual
   supervision with a real-time information synchronizing system and camera
   system. This paper describes the possible applications of information
   technologies in the construction industry with the introduction of the
   i-Booth (c). Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In the present work, the alternating current (AC) induced corrosion of a
   cathodically protected X65 pipeline steel was studied in a neutral,
   extracted soil solution and a high pH, carbonate/bicarbonate solution by
   electrochemical and weight loss measurements, and surface
   characterisation. It was found that AC corrosion causes the alkalisation
   of the soil environment in the vicinity of pipeline no matter what the
   cathodic protection (CP) condition is. The degree of alkalisation
   depends on the AC current density. In the absence of AC interference or
   at a low AC current density, i.e. 20 A m(-2), a CP potential of -950 mV
   versus Cu/CuSO(4) electrode provides a full protection over the steel.
   When the AC current density is >20 A m(-2), a new CP standard is
   recommended to avoid AC corrosion of pipelines.}},

Pages = {{21-28}},
Abstract = {{Incorrect patellar resection during total knee arthroplasty can lead to
   anterior knee pain, patellar maltracking, patellofemoral impingement,
   patellar fracture, component loosening and reduced range of motion. A
   computer-assisted surgery (CAS) system was developed to improve the
   accuracy of the patellar cut. Twelve cadaveric knee specimens (6 pairs)
   were surgically prepared and the patella resected by two senior
   orthopaedic residents using either a conventional sawguide technique
   (right knee) or a computer-assisted sawguide technique (left knee).
   Multiple cuts and measurements were permitted for the conventional
   technique, to reflect the clinical situation, whereas only a single cut
   was permitted for the CAS technique. Prior training had been provided on
   artificial bones for both techniques. Custom marker arrays were mounted
   on the sawguide and patella. The user positioned the sawguide based on a
   real-time display that compared the current sawguide plane to the ideal
   resection. The resulting mediolateral and superoinferior resection
   angles and central thickness were measured from CT scans of the
   specimens, relative to the anterior surface of the patella. Both
   techniques resulted in symmetric cuts (<7 degrees). Repeatability in the
   mediolateral direction was better for the CAS technique than for the
   conventional technique (p < 0.01). This study demonstrated that
   computer-assisted patellar resection is a feasible approach that can
   produce results equal to or better than those obtained with conventional
   techniques, even when the experimental conditions favor the conventional
   technique. Improvements in the CAS hardware could further improve the
   accuracy and usability of the system, resulting in reductions in
   postoperative complications. Patellar CAS could also serve as a valuable
   tool for feedback and training.}},

Abstract = {{In a probabilistic analysis of rock slope stability, the Monte Carlo
   simulation technique has been widely used to evaluate the probability of
   slope failure. While the Monte Carlo simulation technique has many
   advantages, the technique requires complete information of the random
   variables in stability analysis; however, in practice, it is difficult
   to obtain complete information from a field investigation. The
   information on random variables is usually limited due to the restraints
   of sampling numbers. This is why approximation methods have been
   proposed for reliability analyses. Approximation methods, such as the
   first-order second-moment method and the point estimate method, require
   only the mean and standard deviation of the random variable; therefore,
   it is easy to utilize when the information is limited. Usually, a single
   closed form of the formula for the evaluation of the factor of safety is
   needed for an approximation method. However, the commonly used stability
   analysis method of wedge failure is complicated and cumbersome and does
   not provide a simple equation for the evaluation of the factor of
   safety. Consequently, the approximation method is not appropriate for
   wedge failure. In order to overcome this limitation, a simple equation,
   which is obtained from the maximum likelihood estimation method for
   wedge failure, is utilized to calculate the probability of failure. A
   simple equation for the direct estimation of the safety factors for
   wedge failure has been empirically derived from failed and stable cases
   of slope, using the maximum likelihood estimation method. The developed
   technique has been applied to a practical example, and the results from
   the developed technique were compared to the results from the Monte
   Carlo simulation technique.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Proteoglycan 4 (PRG4), also known as lubricin, is a boundary
   lubricating mucin-like glycoprotein present on several tissue surfaces
   in the body. The objectives of this study were to (1) implement and
   characterize an in vitro boundary lubrication test at a human
   cornea-polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) biointerface and (2) determine the
   dose-dependent and synergistic effects of PRG4, with hyaluronan (HA), on
   ocular surface boundary lubrication using this test.
   Methods: Human corneas and model PDMS material were articulated against
   each other, at effective sliding velocities nu(eff) between 0.3 and 30
   mm/sec under physiologic loads of approximately 8 to 25 kPa. Samples
   were tested serially in (1) saline, PRG4 at 30, 100, 300 mu g/mL
   resuspended in saline, then saline again or (2) saline, AQuify Comfort
   Eye Drops (containing 0.1\% HA), 300 mu g/mL PRG4 in saline, 300 mu g/mL
   PRG4 in AQuify, then saline again. Both static and kinetic friction
   coefficients were calculated.
   Results: PRG4 effectively lowered friction at the cornea-PDMS
   biointerface, both alone in a dose-dependent manner and in combination
   with HA. PRG4 reduced kinetic friction coefficients, <mu(kinetic,)
   (Neq)>, from approximately 0.30 in saline, to approximately 0.30, 0.24,
   and 0.17 in 30, 100, and 300 mu g/mL PRG4, respectively. Values of
   <mu(kinetic, Neq)> in AQuify, approximately 0.32, were similar to those
   in saline; however, when combined with 300 mu g/mL PRG4, values of
   <mu(kinetic, Neq)> were reduced to approximately 0.15.
   Conclusions: PRG4 functions as an effective ocular surface boundary
   lubricant, both alone in a dose-dependent manner and in combination with
   HA.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Mean axes of rotation {[}MAR] of cervical joints are an
   effective measure of spine pathology. Khan Kinetic Treatment {[}KKT] is
   known to relieve symptoms, but its biomechanical effects have not been
   quantified. This study assesses KKT efficacy using MAR correction and
   its associated effects.
   Methods: The intervention applies vibrations via stylus to a bony
   landmark of the spine. Using saggital plane cervical Xrays, pre-post
   intervention MARs were computed for 44 patients with chronic neck pain.
   The study was randomized, single blinded, and sham controlled for
   outcome measure comparisons. Mechanical input was assessed using a load
   cell and vertebral acceleration and the outcome measures were: 1.
   cervical MARs, 2. self-reported neck pain, 3. neck disability index
   scores, and 4. psycho-social assessments.
   Results: 1. Average peak force on vertebrae during treatment was 10.3 N
   and the average peak acceleration was 2.19G, 2. KKT improved pain and
   neck disability scores significantly over shams, 3. KKT corrected 62
   percent of abnormal MARs with significantly larger MAR vector magnitude
   differences {[}pre-post] at the C5-6 level than shams, 4. in patients
   without changes in MAR locations, KKT significantly improved neck
   disability scores above shams, 5. MAR correction was significantly
   related to improving both pain and neck disability across all subjects.
   Conclusions: We present biomechanical evidence of spinal
   ``re-alignment{''} and its ability to improve both pain and neck
   disability. Capacity to improve neck disability despite no change in MAR
   locations indicates that MAR correction, while effective, is not the
   sole mechanism behind the interventions success.}},

Abstract = {{Soft biological tissues with collagen reinforcement can be represented
   by a porous matrix saturated by a fluid and reinforced by a network of
   statistically oriented, impermeable fibres. This paper aims at
   determining the effect of the fibres on both the elastic properties and
   the permeability of the system, under large deformations, and represents
   the unification and generalisation of previous works in which the
   elasticity was studied for a pure solid, in the absence of the pore
   fluid, and the permeability was studied in the neighbourhood of the
   undeformed configuration. Throughout this work, the saturation
   constraint is assumed to hold, and the solid and fluid phases are
   assumed to be intrinsically incompressible. These hypotheses imply that
   the volumetric fraction of one of the two phases (e.g., the solid) is
   sufficient to determine the distribution of solid and fluid mass at
   every point of the homogenised porous medium. Overall incompressibility
   is achieved at compaction, i.e., when pores are closed and all the fluid
   has escaped. A new form of the elastic strain energy potential is
   proposed, based on the sum of a given ``base{''} potential and a
   ``correction{''} potential, function of the volumetric deformation,
   which serves solely to impose the incompressibility constraint at
   compaction. The large-strain overall permeability is obtained by
   employing a pull-back of the structure tensor to the reference
   configuration. This gives rise to an integral form of the permeability
   that needs to be calculated at each increment of deformation. The
   presentation is entirely covariant, so that general curvilinear
   coordinates can immediately be employed, if needed. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Ultra-wideband (UWB) microwave radar imaging techniques provide a
   non-invasive means to extract information related to an object's
   internal structure. For these applications, a short-duration
   electromagnetic wave is transmitted into an object of interest and the
   backscattered fields that arise due to dielectric contrasts at
   interfaces are measured. In this paper, we present a method that may be
   used to estimate the time-of-arrival (TOA) parameter associated with
   each reflection that arises due to a dielectric property discontinuity
   (or dielectric interface). A second method uses this information to
   identify the locations of points on these interfaces. When data are
   collected at a number of sensor locations surrounding the object, the
   collection of points may be used to estimate the shape of contours that
   segregate and enclose dissimilar regions within the object. The
   algorithm is tested with data generated when a cylindrical wave is
   applied to a number of numerical 2D models of increasing complexity.
   Moreover, the algorithm's feasibility is evaluated using data generated
   from breast models constructed from magnetic resonance (MR) breast
   scans. Results show that this is a promising approach to identifying
   regions and the internal structure within the breast.}},

Title = {{Deficiency of Approximate Interblock Conductivities for Simulation of
   Horizontal Unsaturated Flow}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORT IN POROUS MEDIA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{627-647}},

Abstract = {{Determination of appropriate horizontal interblock conductivities
   approximations (k (app)) is a critical step for numerical solution of
   unsaturated flow by finite difference method. This study characterized
   the horizontal effective interblock conductivity (k (H)) and the
   classical k (app) by contour map. The deficiencies of the k (app) were
   determined by both statistical method and wetting front prediction.
   Mathematical expressions of the k (H) were redeveloped for three
   constitutive hydraulic functions. A large database including ten
   different k (app) formulas, three hydraulic functions, and a large range
   of soil texture is used to determine the deficiencies of the k (app) for
   simulation of horizontal unsaturated flow. Some k (app) may be either
   higher or lower than the k (H) since they depend on both the expression
   forms of the k (app) and the specific hydraulic functions. For the soil
   described by the Gardner function, the horizontal wetting front
   generated from the k (H) is almost equivalent to the analytical
   solution, but those predicted from the k (app) with certain errors. For
   the soils described by the Brooks-Corey function and the van Genuchten
   function, the best k (app) for approximating the k (H) were also
   determined, but with conversions for the soils described by the van
   Genuchten function. For any two k (app) that hold compatible medians,
   the k (app) (> k (H)) better tracks the wetting front and makes mass
   conservation than the k (app) (< k (H)) does. The ranking list of k
   (app) with respect to the quality of approximation k (H) is ultimately
   determined from the analysis of mass balance of the simulation based on
   the large database. Ten k (app) can be divided into four clusters. The
   logarithm mean and the arithmetic mean calculated from saturation can
   produce the best simulation results with relative mass balance error
   averagely less than 2\%. Simulations conducted with harmonic mean
   calculated from hydraulic conductivity are mostly associated with the
   largest mass balance errors. Such a mean can therefore not be used to
   simulate horizontal water front advance, whatever the soil type and
   whatever the model of hydrodynamic function. It is also suggested that
   use of the classical k (app) in a numerical process may generate
   improper results, thus application of the k (H) is convincingly
   recommended on the prediction of horizontal wetting front.}},

Abstract = {{Removing leukocytes (white cells) from blood products such as
   platelet-rich plasma (PRP) prevents serious problems for the PRP
   recipients. We present a model to study selective separation of
   leukocytes from a dilute suspension of leukocytes and platelets (PRP)
   using fibrous filters. A selective PRP filter permits platelets to pass
   but bars the way for leukocytes. In PRP filters, fine synthetic fibers
   are packed randomly and interstices are larger than cells. Interactive
   forces between the suspended cells and fibers determine cell capture
   yield, i.e., deep-bed filtration process. Our model is based on a
   hierarchical set of differential equations corresponding to porescale
   and macroscale. At the porescale, we model movement and interaction of
   cells with fibers. A single cell entering the interstitial space
   encounters drag and surface forces. We define a unit bed element (UBE)
   composed of a fiber and interstitial space, where fiber diameter
   corrected for the size of the cells. We add measured surface forces
   between cells and fibers (electrostatic, van der Waals, fluid expression
   resistance, and biological responses) to the cell velocity equation. We
   then transform pore scale events into macroscale continuum by imposing
   periodic boundary conditions for contiguous UBEs and applying
   macrotransport theory. At macroscale, two independent coefficients: mean
   cell velocity vector U{*} and mean cell capture yield constant
   K{*}characterize cell filtration efficiency. Our model showed reasonable
   match with experimental data. Model results showed that diameter of
   fibers, injection velocity, bed porosity, and bed thickness control
   selective capture of leukocytes. Our model showed that it is merely
   impossible to filter out all leukocytes without capturing platelets.
   Based on our model, an optimized filter can capture 90\% of leukocytes
   and pass through 45\% of platelets.}},

Title = {{Knudsen's Permeability Correction for Tight Porous Media}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORT IN POROUS MEDIA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{239-260}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Various flow regimes including Knudsen, transition, slip and viscous
   flows (Darcy's law), as applied to flow of natural gas through porous
   conventional rocks, tight formations and shale systems, are
   investigated. Data from the Mesaverde formation in the United States are
   used to demonstrate that the permeability correction factors range
   generally between 1 and 10. However, there are instances where the
   corrections can be between 10 and 100 for gas flow with high Knudsen
   number in the transition flow regime, and especially in the Knudsen's
   flow regime. The results are of practical interest as gas permeability
   in porous media can be more complex than that of liquid. The gas
   permeability is influenced by slippage of gas, which is a
   pressure-dependent parameter, commonly referred to as Klinkenberg's
   effect. This phenomenon plays a substantial role in gas flow through
   porous media, especially in unconventional reservoirs with low
   permeability, such as tight sands, coal seams, and shale formations. A
   higher-order permeability correlation for gas flow called Knudsen's
   permeability is studied. As opposed to Klinkenberg's correlation, which
   is a first-order equation, Knudsen's correlation is a second-order
   approximation. Even higher-order equations can be derived based on the
   concept used in developing this model. A plot of permeability correction
   factor versus Knudsen number gives a typecurve. This typecurve can be
   used to generalize the permeability correction in tight porous media. We
   conclude that Knudsen's permeability correlation is more accurate than
   Klinkenberg's model especially for extremely tight porous media with
   transition and free molecular flow regimes. The results from this study
   indicate that Klinkenberg's model and various extensions developed
   throughout the past years underestimate the permeability correction
   especially for the case of fluid flow with the high Knudsen number.}},

   capacity-constrained supply chain with continuous-review reorder point

   include reorder points, reorder quantities and a maximum backorder
   constraint. Optimization is based on maximizing profits, considering
   revenue along with holding, tardiness and lost sales costs. A key
   contribution is the development of a sampling methodology that allows
   this problem to be solved experimentally using simulation-optimization
   Results are compared when using the demand rate probability
   distributions versus using only the mean demand rates as inputs for
   optimization. Higher profits are observed when using the probability

   program is to provide university educators of electrical engineering
   (EE), computer engineering (CE), computer science (CS), biomedical
   engineering (BE) and electrical engineering technology (EET) with a
   library of high-quality, tested, hands-on, team-based, and
   society-focused projects for first-year students.
   These projects are designed to increase the recruitment, persistence to
   degree, and satisfaction of all students, in baccalaureate EE, CE, CS,
   BE and EET degree programs. In many EE/CE/CS/BE/EET programs, current
   first-year curricula focus on the theoretical and mathematical
   components of engineering. The vehicle for change is a series of
   IEEE-approved hands-on projects that educators are able to use in the
   first-year classroom in order to acquaint their students to the practice
   of these disciplines.
   The projects clearly demonstrate a benefit to society in general and
   also involve the students at a more intimate level than a typical
   lecture. Research has shown the recruitment of women gains significantly
   from the illustration of how electrical and computer engineers and
   computer scientists benefit society. The persistent under-participation
   of women in engineering and computer science is an area of continued
   concern to governments, industry leaders, policy making bodies, and
   professional associations.}},

Abstract = {{Advancement of computer, software, telecommunication and internet
   technologies during the last twenty years has fundamentally shifted the
   focus of the expertise in control-systems engineering (CSE) industry. It
   is evident that building high-quality modern control systems requires a
   multi-disciplinary effort as a single engineer simply cannot be an
   expert in all the related areas, e.g., software/computer engineering,
   computer science and information systems. As an experience and evidence
   report, this article reports on the challenges in CSE based on the
   authors' experience and presents observations and potential
   recommendations for multi-disciplinary nature of CSE. It is hoped that
   the article would bring awareness to the community and would be useful
   for the industrial practitioners and researchers working in this area in
   building stronger multi-disciplinary CSE teams and, ultimately, in
   building higher-quality modern control systems.}},

Title = {{Design and Implementation of an Autonomic Code Generator Based on RTPA}},
Booktitle = {{BREAKTHROUGHS IN SOFTWARE SCIENCE AND COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Pages = {{196-218}},
Abstract = {{Real-Time Process Algebra (RTPA) is a denotational mathematics for the
   algebraic modeling and manipulations of software system architectures
   and behaviors by the Unified Data Models (UDMs) and Unified Process
   Models (UPMs). On the basis of the RTPA specification and refinement
   methodologies, automatic software code generation is enabled toward
   improving software development productivity. This paper examines
   designing and developing the RTPA-based software code generator
   (RTPA-CG) that transfers system models in RTPA architectures and
   behaviors into C++ or Java. A two-phrase strategy has been employed in
   the design of the code generator. The first phrase analyzes the lexical,
   syntactical, and type specifications of a software system modeled in
   RTPA, which results in a set of abstract syntax trees (ASTs). The second
   phrase translates the ASTs into C++ or Java based on predesigned mapping
   strategies and code generation rules. The toolkit of RTPA code generator
   encompasses an RTPA lexer, parser, type-checker, and a code builder.
   Experimental results show that system models in RTPA can be rigorously
   processed and corresponding C++/Java code can be automatically generated
   using the toolkit. The code generated is executable and effective under
   the support of an RTPA run-time library.}},

Abstract = {{Construction related process-based simulation platforms have
   demonstrated strong capabilities in supporting decision makers in a
   volatile environment with many unknowns; however, their use has been
   limited at best. One of the main reasons can be attributed to poorly
   designed and non-intuitive software interfaces. With advancements in
   programming languages and their capabilities, various steps are being
   taken to address some of the interface challenges. This paper presents
   an innovative approach which facilitates the user definition of
   engineering equations for a construction simulation platform (SimFC).
   A real life pile design exercise was modeled using SimFC to further
   illustrate the use of this modeling approach. It was found that the
   model produced using SimFC was valid and can be used for further
   engineering design modeling and estimation. Furthermore, the performance
   of the system was also compared against a hardcoded solution. It was
   found that although SimFC's runtime was slower, the performance
   degradation was not significant. The findings are of particular interest
   to construction engineers, designers, estimators, project managers and
   researchers who are interested in using and promoting simulation in
   engineering and construction.}},

Abstract = {{The study of spatial systems, such as urban systems, and Land-Use
   Science have been profoundly transformed in the last two decades by the
   emergence and spread of cellular automata (CA) models designed to
   simulate future land-use patterns from a bottom-up perspective. The
   fundamental elements in CA models are individual spatial units defined
   by their location, geometry, and attribute that evolve through time and
   over space according to the influence of their neighbors and some
   external factors. The aim of CA modeling is to capture this influence
   through a set of rules in order to generate meaningful patterns that
   represent possible paths the spatial system being simulated can take in
   the future. If well designed, CA models can inform on the processes that
   govern urban growth and land-use dynamics and can be used to explore
   future outcomes through the testing of alternative scenarios. However,
   to be useful, the architecture and implementation of these models, along
   with their assumptions must be stated in an explicit way in order to be
   understood and evaluated by the scientific and users' communities. In
   addition, adequate techniques must be applied to verify to what extent
   the estimations of both quantity and location of change provided by CA
   models can be trusted. The objective of this paper is twofold: 1) to
   highlight some of the key assumptions in CA modeling, and 2) to describe
   the progress recently made in attempts to meet these assumptions.}},

Abstract = {{Architectural distortion is a subtle but important early sign of breast
   cancer The purpose of this study is to develop methods for the detection
   of sites of architectural distortion in prior mammograms of
   interval-cancer cases. Screening mammograms obtained prior to the
   detection of cancer could contain subtle signs of early stages of breast
   cancel; in particular architectural distortion. The methods for the
   detection of architectural distortion are based upon Gabor filters,
   phase portrait analysis, a novel method for the analysis of the angular
   spread of power fractal analysis via Fractal Dimension (FD), structural
   analysis of texture via Laws texture energy measures derived from
   geometrically transformed regions of interest (ROA), and statistical
   analysis of texture using Haralick:s 14 texture,features. The
   application of Gabor filters and linear phase portrait modeling was used
   to detect initial candidates of sites of architectural distortion: 4,224
   Rals, including 301 true-positive ROIs related to architectural
   distortion, were automatically obtained from 106 prior mammograms of 56
   interval-cancer cases and from 52 mammograms of 13 normal cases. For
   each ROI, the FD, three measures of angular spread of power 10 Laws'
   measures, and 14 HaralickS features were computed. The areas under the
   receiver operating characteristic curves obtained using the features
   selected by, stepwise logistic regression and the leave-one-ROTont
   method are 0.76 with the Bayesian classifier 0.75 TV with Fisher linear
   discriminate analysis, and 0.78 with a single-layer feed forward neural
   network. Free-response receiver operating characteristics indicated
   sensitivities of 0.80 and 0.90 at 5.8 and 8.1 false positives per image,
   respectively, with the Bayesian classifier and the leave-one-image-out
   method The methods have shown good potential in detecting architectural

Abstract = {{Condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of operating machinery have
   been of the main interests for many years. Existing systems employ data
   driven models which has limited prediction capability. On the contrary,
   a physics based model can predict phenomena that the system has not seen
   before. It also provides a means for root cause analysis. However, major
   obstacles include the complexity involved and real-time feasibility. In
   this paper, we use the bond graph technique to construct an analytical,
   physics-based model. We use a reciprocating compressor as an example
   since it is a good representation of multi-domain processes with a
   variety of possible failure modes. The bond graph model is cross
   examined with a finite element model and ultimately validated. To show
   how one can benefit from this approach, cracked piston rod is simulated.
   to generate vibration signals that can potentially be picked up from
   accelerometers mounted on the exterior surface of the compressor}},

Abstract = {{Laser scanning, whether airborne or terrestrial is being used nowadays
   for wide spectrum of applications. In addition, many advances have been
   introduced to the laser scanning technology in the last decade; thus
   resulting into increased performance in terms of the point density,
   scanner range, and expected point accuracy. On the other hand, users are
   encountering scenarios where the integration of various laser datasets
   becomes essential in order to avoid data gaps (e.g., missing building
   roofs in the terrestrial scans, or missing structure facades in the
   airborne case). This problem is usually solved seamlessly through a
   classical transformation when the average point accuracy is relatively
   homogeneous over a given dataset. However, this is not usually the case;
   in this work, we propose a workflow for the optimal registration of
   multisource point clouds using weighted conformal transformation. First,
   the individual scans are filtered and the local point attributes are
   populated through a data characterization step. Then, an ICPP-based
   weighted registration algorithm is performed over the entire datasets
   until convergence. Finally, our heterogeneous segmentation procedure is
   performed in a simultaneous fashion to ensure exploiting the full
   potential of a dataset. The performance of this algorithm in terms of
   correctness, automation level, and other factors is evaluated using real
   datasets with significant variations in point densities and accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Structural health monitoring of civil infrastructure systems is an
   important procedure in terms of both safety and serviceability.
   Traditionally, large structures have been monitored using surveying
   techniques, while fine-scale monitoring of structural components has
   been done with instrumentation for civil engineering purposes. As a
   remote sensing technique, photogrammetry does not need any contact with
   the object being monitored, and this can be a great advantage when it
   comes to the deformation monitoring of inaccessible structures. The
   paper shows a low-cost setup of multiple off-the-shelf digital cameras
   and projectors used for three-dimensional photogrammetric reconstruction
   for the purpose of deformation monitoring of structural elements. This
   photogrammetric system setup was used in an experiment, where a concrete
   beam was being deformed by a hydraulic actuator. Both static and dynamic
   loading conditions were tested. The system did not require any physical
   targets other than to establish the relative orientation between the
   involved cameras. The experiment proved that it was possible to detect
   sub-millimetre level deflections given the used equipment and the
   geometry of the setup.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile Mapping Systems (MMS) allow for fast and cost-effective
   collection of geo-spatial information. Such systems integrate a set of
   imaging sensors and a position and orientation system (POS), which
   entails GPS and INS units. System calibration is a crucial process to
   ensure the attainment of the expected accuracy of such systems. It
   involves the calibration of the individual sensors as well as the
   calibration of the mounting parameters relating the system components.
   The mounting parameters of multi-camera MMS include two sets of relative
   orientation parameters (ROP): the lever arm offsets and the boresight
   angles relating the cameras and the IMU body frame and the ROP among the
   cameras (in the absence of GPS/INS data). In this paper, a novel
   single-step calibration method, which has the ability of estimating
   these two sets of ROP, is devised. Besides the ability to estimate the
   ROP among the cameras, the proposed method can use such parameters as
   prior information in the ISO procedure. The implemented procedure
   consists of an integrated sensor orientation (ISO) where the
   GPS/INS-derived position and orientation and the system mounting
   parameters are directly incorporated in the collinearity equations. The
   concept of modified collinearity equations has been used by few authors
   for single-camera systems. In this paper, a new modification to the
   collinearity equations for GPS/INS-assisted multi-camera systems is
   introduced. Experimental results using a real dataset demonstrate the
   feasibility of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Path finding solutions are becoming a major part of many GIS
   applications including location based services and web-based GIS
   services. Most traditional path finding solutions are based on shortest
   path algorithms that tend to minimize the cost of travel from one point
   to another. These algorithms make use of some cost criteria that is
   usually an attribute of the edges in the graph network. Providing one
   shortest path limits user's flexibility when choosing a possible route,
   especially when more than one parameter is utilized to calculate cost
   (e.g., when length, number of traffic lights, and number of turns are
   used to calculate network cost.) K shortest path solutions tend to
   overcome this problem by providing second, third, and Kth shortest
   paths. These algorithms are efficient as long as the graphs edge weight
   does not change dynamically and no other parameters affect edge weights.
   In this paper we try to go beyond finding shortest paths based on some
   cost value, and provide all possible paths disregarding any parameter
   that may affect total cost. After finding all possible paths, we can
   rank the results by any parameter or combination of parameters, without
   a substantial increase in time complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past few years, LiDAR systems have been established as a
   leading technology for the acquisition of high density point clouds over
   physical surfaces. These point clouds will be processed for the
   extraction of geo-spatial information. Local point density is one of the
   most important properties of the point cloud that highly affects the
   performance of data processing techniques and the quality of extracted
   information from these data. Therefore, it is necessary to define a
   standard methodology for the estimation of local point density indices
   to be considered for the precise processing of LiDAR data. Current
   definitions of local point density indices, which only consider the 2D
   neighbourhood of individual points, are not appropriate for 3D LiDAR
   data and cannot be applied for laser scans from different platforms. In
   order to resolve the drawbacks of these methods, this paper proposes
   several approaches for the estimation of the local point density index
   which take the 3D relationship among the points and the physical
   properties of the surfaces they belong to into account. In the simplest
   approach, an approximate value of the local point density for each point
   is defined while considering the 3D relationship among the points. In
   the other approaches, the local point density is estimated by
   considering the 3D neighbourhood of the point in question and the
   physical properties of the surface which encloses this point. The
   physical properties of the surfaces enclosing the LiDAR points are
   assessed through eigen-value analysis of the 3D neighbourhood of
   individual points and adaptive cylinder methods. This paper will discuss
   these approaches and highlight their impact on various LiDAR data
   processing activities (i.e., neighbourhood definition, region growing,
   segmentation, boundary detection, and classification). Experimental
   results from airborne and terrestrial LiDAR data verify the efficacy of
   considering local point density variation for precise LiDAR data
   processing.}},

Abstract = {{Digital Building Model is an important component in many applications
   such as city modelling, natural disaster planning, and aftermath
   evaluation. The importance of accurate and up-to-date building models
   has been discussed by many researchers, and many different approaches
   for efficient building model generation have been proposed. They can be
   categorised according to the data source used, the data processing
   strategy, and the amount of human interaction. In terms of data source,
   due to the limitations of using single source data, integration of
   multi-senor data is desired since it preserves the advantages of the
   involved datasets. Aerial imagery and LiDAR data are among the commonly
   combined sources to obtain 3D building models with good vertical
   accuracy from laser scanning and good planimetric accuracy from aerial
   images. The most used data processing strategies are data-driven and
   model-driven ones. Theoretically one can model any shape of buildings
   using data-driven approaches but practically it leaves the question of
   how to impose constraints and set the rules during the generation
   process. Due to the complexity of the implementation of the data-driven
   approaches, model-based approaches draw the attention of the
   researchers. However, the major drawback of model-based approaches is
   that the establishment of representative models involves a manual
   process that requires human intervention. Therefore, the objective of
   this research work is to automatically generate building models using
   the Minimum Bounding Rectangle algorithm and sequentially adjusting them
   to combine the advantages of image and LiDAR datasets.}},

Abstract = {{The classification of urban objects such as buildings, trees and roads
   from airborne sensors data is an essential step in numerous mapping and
   modelling applications. The automation of this step is greatly needed as
   the manual processing is costly and time consuming. The increasing
   availability of airborne sensors data such as aerial imagery and LIDAR
   data offers new opportunities to develop more robust approaches for
   automatic classification. These approaches should integrate these data
   sources that have different characteristics to exceed the accuracy
   achieved using any individual data source. The proposed approach
   presented in this paper fuses the aerial images data with single return
   LIDAR data to extract buildings and trees for an urban area. Object
   based analysis is adopted to segment the entire DSM data into objects
   based on height variation. These objects are preliminarily classified
   into buildings, trees, and ground. This primary classification is used
   to compute the height to ground for each object to help improve the
   accuracy of the second phase of classification. The overlapping
   perspective aerial images are used to build an ortho-photo to derive a
   vegetation index value for each object. The second phase of
   classification is performed based on the height to ground and the
   vegetation index of each object. The proposed approach has been tested
   using three areas in the centre of the city of Vaihingen provided by
   ISPRS test project on urban classification and 3D building
   reconstruction. These areas have historic buildings having rather
   complex shapes, few high-rising residential buildings that are
   surrounded by trees, and a purely residential area with small detached
   houses. The results of the proposed approach are presented based on a
   reference solution for evaluation purposes. The classification
   evaluation exhibits highly successful classification results of
   buildings class. The proposed approach follows the exact boundary of
   trees based on LIDAR data which provide above average classification
   results for the trees when compared to the assumed ideal circular shaped
   trees in the reference data.}},

Abstract = {{The ubiquity of mobile devices (such as smartphones and tablet-PCs) has
   encouraged the use of location-based services (LBS) that are relevant to
   the current location and context of a mobile user. The main challenge of
   LBS is to find a pervasive and accurate personal navigation system (PNS)
   in different situations of a mobile user. In this paper, we propose a
   method of personal navigation for pedestrians that allows a user to
   freely move in outdoor environments. This system aims at detection of
   the context information which is useful for improving personal
   navigation. The context information for a PNS consists of user activity
   modes (e.g. walking, stationary, driving, and etc.) and the mobile
   device orientation and placement with respect to the user. After
   detecting the context information, a low-cost integrated positioning
   algorithm has been employed to estimate pedestrian navigation
   parameters. The method is based on the integration of the relative
   user's motion (changes of velocity and heading angle) estimation based
   on the video image matching and absolute position information provided
   by GPS. A Kalman filter (KF) has been used to improve the navigation
   solution when the user is walking and the phone is in his/her hand. The
   Experimental results demonstrate the capabilities of this method for

Abstract = {{World-wide sensor web generates tremendous amount of sensor data stream
   allowing people to observe events that were previously unobservable.
   Sensor web has been wildly applied in many monitoring systems; some of
   them are extremely time-sensitive, e.g., disaster management systems.
   However, with the growing amount of sensor data, the traditional
   request/response communication model becomes inefficient as it is based
   on point-to-point pulling interactions between users and data providers.
   In order to address this issue, publish/subscribe communication model
   has been proposed and applied in many applications, e.g., web blogging.
   The publish/subscribe model utilizes an intermediary broker on matching
   predefined queries with the data pushed to the broker. However, we argue
   that the publish/subscribe model is hard to be directly applied to
   sensor web due to the fact that most sensor web services are based on
   pulling interaction model only. For instance, more and more sensor data
   providers are publishing their sensor data with the Open Geospatial
   Consortium (OGC) Sensor Observation Service (SOS) standards, and the OGC
   SOS services are based on the request/response model. Therefore, in
   order to address this issue, we propose a hybrid pull-push system to
   retrieve sensor web data in a timely manner. The preliminary
   experimental results indicate that the proposed system is able to fetch
   near real time sensor streams from pull-based sensor web services.}},

Abstract = {{Terrestrial Laser Scanners (TLSs) have become state-of-the-art
   metrological sensors for many surveying purposes in recent years. Due to
   the demand for high precision surveying with TLSs, efficient, rigorous
   and in-situ calibration methodologies are always desired. Recent
   research on in-situ calibration with planar features has demonstrated
   improved cost-effectiveness and promising results (Glennie and Lichti,
   2010; Chow et al., 2011; Chow et al., 2012). However, if there is a need
   for calibrating the scanners when sufficient plane surfaces with several
   orientations are not available, as commonly occurs indoors, other common
   geometric features, namely cylindrical structures, can be used as
   alternative geometric constraints for in-situ self-calibration.
   Cylindrical features can be found in indoor environments such as water
   pipes attached to the walls or suspended from ceilings, concrete
   pillars, metal poles and many others. In this paper, three 3D models of
   cylinders, with vertical and horizontal orientations containing one
   scaling, two rotational and two translational parameters are discussed.
   The cylinder models are parameterized with the sexternal orientation
   parameters and the additional parameters as the least-squares functional
   models for the self-calibration. The self-calibration is examined with
   the real data obtained from the Lecia HDS6100 panoramic TLS. The results
   of vertical, horizontal and mixed cylinder-based calibration with data
   captured by different scanner position are analysed in detail in terms
   of the parameters correlations. The results show realistic estimation of
   calibration parameters for several cases. The results also suggest that
   using both vertical and horizontal cylinders for the calibration can
   effectively decorrelate the parameters especially for the case of lack
   of cylinder point cloud overlap. The concepts developed in this paper
   might also be extended to the hybrid type TLSs, as well as to the
   self-calibration of airborne laser scanning (ALS) using cylindrical
   features such as oil pipes or other large scale cylindrical
   infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{Recent technological advancements have made active imaging sensors
   popular for 3D modelling and motion tracking. The 3D coordinates of
   signalised targets are traditionally estimated by matching conjugate
   points in overlapping images. Current 3D cameras can acquire point
   clouds at video frame rates from a single exposure station. In the area
   of 3D cameras, Microsoft and PrimeSense have collaborated and developed
   an active 3D camera based on the triangulation principle, known as the
   Kinect system. This off-the-shelf system costs less than \$ 150 USD and
   has drawn a lot of attention from the robotics, computer vision, and
   photogrammetry disciplines. In this paper, the prospect of using the
   Kinect system for precise engineering applications was evaluated. The
   geometric quality of the Kinect system as a function of the scene (i.e.
   variation of depth, ambient light conditions, incidence angle, and
   object reflectivity) and the sensor (i.e. warm-up time and distance
   averaging) were analysed quantitatively. This system's potential in
   human body measurements was tested against a laser scanner and 3D range
   camera. A new calibration model for simultaneously determining the
   exterior orientation parameters, interior orientation parameters,
   boresight angles, leverarm, and object space features parameters was
   developed and the effectiveness of this calibration approach was
   explored.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile terrestrial laser scanners (MTLS) produce huge 3D point clouds
   describing the terrestrial surface, from which objects like different
   street furniture can be generated. Extraction and modelling of the
   street curb and the street floor from MTLS point clouds is important for
   many applications such as right-of-way asset inventory, road maintenance
   and city planning. The proposed pipeline for the curb and street floor
   extraction consists of a sequence of five steps: organizing the 3D point
   cloud and nearest neighbour search; 3D density-based segmentation to
   segment the ground; morphological analysis to refine out the ground
   segment; derivative of Gaussian filtering to detect the curb; solving
   the travelling salesman problem to form a closed polygon of the curb and
   point-in-polygon test to extract the street floor. Two mobile laser
   scanning datasets of different scenes are tested with the proposed
   pipeline. The results of the extracted curb and street floor are
   evaluated based on a truth data. The obtained detection rates for the
   extracted street floor for the datasets are 95\% and 96.53\%. This study
   presents a novel approach to the detection and extraction of the road
   curb and the street floor from unorganized 3D point clouds captured by
   MTLS. It utilizes only the 3D coordinates of the point cloud.}},

Abstract = {{The automatic interpretation of human gestures can be used for a natural
   interaction with computers without the use of mechanical devices such as
   keyboards and mice. The recognition of hand postures have been studied
   for many years. However, most of the literature in this area has
   considered 2D images which cannot provide a full description of the hand
   gestures. In addition, a rotation-invariant identification remains an
   unsolved problem even with the use of 2D images. The objective of the
   current study is to design a rotation-invariant recognition process
   while using a 3D signature for classifying hand postures. An heuristic
   and voxel-based signature has been designed and implemented. The
   tracking of the hand motion is achieved with the Kalman filter. A unique
   training image per posture is used in the supervised classification. The
   designed recognition process and the tracking procedure have been
   successfully evaluated. This study has demonstrated the efficiency of
   the proposed rotation invariant 3D hand posture signature which leads to
   98.24\% recognition rate after testing 12723 samples of 12 gestures
   taken from the alphabet of the American Sign Language.}},

Abstract = {{Concrete beams are used to construct bridges and other structures. Due
   to the traffic overloading or the decaying state of structures,
   deformation of bridges or other structures occurs frequently. Therefore,
   the requirement to measure concrete beam deformation, as integral
   components of structures, is well recognized. Many imaging techniques
   such as digital cameras, laser scanners and range cameras have been
   proven to be accurate and cost-effective methods for large-area
   measurement of deformation under static loading conditions. However, for
   obtaining useful information about the behaviour of the beams or
   monitoring real-time bridge deformation, the ability to measurement
   deformation under dynamic loading conditions is also necessary. This
   paper presents a relatively low-cost and high accuracy imaging technique
   to measure the deformation of concrete beams in response to dynamic
   loading with range cameras. However, due to the range camera measurement
   principle, target movement could lead to motion artefacts that degrade
   range measurement accuracy. The results of simulated and real-data
   investigation into the motion artefacts show that the lower sampling
   frequency leads to the more significant motion artefact. The results
   from real data experiments have indicated that periodic deformation can
   be recovered with sub-millimetre accuracy when the 3 Hz and 4 mm
   amplitude target motion is sampled at a rate of least 20 Hz and with 31
   MHz range camera modulation frequency. When the modulation frequency is
   29 MHz, the best sampling frequency is 20 Hz to keep the error under
   sub-millimetre.}},

Abstract = {{The new advances of having eight bands satellite mission similar to
   WorldView-2, WV-2, give the chance to address and solve some of the
   traditional problems related to the low spatial and/or spectral
   resolution; such as the lack of details for certain features or the
   inability of the conventional classifiers to detect some land-cover
   types because of missing efficient spectrum information and analysis
   techniques. High-resolution imagery is particularly well suited to urban
   applications. High spectral and spatial resolution of WorldView-2 data
   introduces challenges in detailed mapping of urban features.
   Classification of Water, Shadows, Red roofs and concrete buildings
   spectrally exhibit significant confusion either from the high similarity
   in the spectral response (e.g. water and Shadows) or the similarity in
   material type (e.g. red roofs and concrete buildings).
   This research study assesses the enhancement of the classification
   accuracy and efficiency for a data set of WorldView-2 satellite imagery
   using the full 8-bands through integrating the output of classification
   process using three band ratios with another step involves an
   object-based technique for extracting shadows, water, vegetation,
   building, Bare soil and asphalt roads. Second generation curvelet
   transform will be used in the second step, specifically to detect
   buildings' boundaries, which will aid the new algorithm of band ratios
   classification through efficient separation of the buildings. The
   combined technique is tested, and the preliminary results show a great
   potential of the new bands in the WV-2 imagery in the separation between
   confusing classes such as water and shadows, and the testing is extended
   to the separation between bare soils and asphalt roads. The Integrated
   band ratio-curvelet transform edge detection techniques increased the
   percentage of building detection by more than 30\%.}},

Abstract = {{Creep can produce significant effects on the structural behaviour of
   composite quasi-brittle systems, such as masonry, by altering the stress
   distribution between and within structural elements. The failure of a
   masonry element can be accelerated through damage incurred by weathering
   or degradation from creep effects. In this study, a three-dimensional
   finite element model of a grouted masonry column is used to evaluate the
   significance of the interaction of creep and damage on the structural
   behaviour of the column. The effects of Poisson's ratio in producing
   differential out-of-plane constraint stresses can be simulated using
   this model. By utilizing a cracking criterion and incorporating a
   cohesive zone material (CZM) model for the brickwork-grout interface,
   the sequence and the patterns of cracking of the masonry column,
   debonding of the interface and local failure are examined. It is shown
   that debonding of the brickwork-grout interface occurs prior to cracking
   of the outer shell of brickwork. Case studies are presented to
   demonstrate the significance of the interaction of creep and damage on
   local failure, cracking and debonding. It is shown that cracking and
   debonding can result in a stability failure of a masonry column that was
   originally in a stable condition. Further work on local buckling and
   post-buckling analysis seems crucial to explain composite masonry
   behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{This article first recalls the results of a stabilized finite element
   method based on a local Gauss integration method for the stationary
   Stokes equations approximated by low equal-order elements that do not
   satisfy the inf-sup condition. Then, we derive general superconvergence
   results for this stabilized method by using a local coarse mesh L-2
   projection. These supervergence results have three prominent features.
   First, they are based on a multiscale method defined for any
   quasi-uniform mesh. Second, they are derived on the basis of a large
   sparse, symmetric positive-definite system of linear equations for the
   solution of the stationary Stokes problem. Third, the finite elements
   used fail to satisfy the inf-sup condition. This article combines the
   merits of the new stabilized method with that of the L-2 projection
   method. This projection method is of practical importance in scientific
   computation. Finally, a series of numerical experiments are presented to
   check the theoretical results obtained. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract = {{The modified second-order sliding mode algorithm is used for controller
   tuning. Namely, the modified suboptimal algorithm-based test (modified
   SOT) and non-parametric tuning rules for
   proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers are presented in this
   article. In the developed method of test and tuning, the idea of
   coordinated selection of the test parameters and the controller tuning
   parameters is introduced. The proposed approach allows for the
   formulation of simple non-parametric tuning rules for PID controllers
   that provide desired amplitude or phase margins exactly. In the modified
   SOT, the frequency of the self-excited oscillations can be generated
   equal to either the phase crossover frequency or the magnitude crossover
   frequency of the open-loop system frequency response (including a future
   PID controller) - depending on the tuning method choice. The first
   option will provide tuning with specification on gain margin, and the
   second option will ensure tuning with specification on phase margin.
   Tuning rules for a PID controller and simulation examples are provided.}},

Abstract = {{The control and estimation of unknown parameters of chaotic systems are
   a daunting task till date from the perspective of nonlinear science.
   Inspired from ecological co-habitation, we propose a variant of Particle
   Swarm Optimization (PSO), known as Chaotic Multi Swarm Particle Swarm
   Optimization (CMS-PSO), by modifying the generic PSO with the help of
   the chaotic sequence for multi-dimension unknown parameter estimation
   and optimization by forming multiple cooperating swarms. This achieves
   load balancing by delegating the global optimizing task to concurrently
   operating swarms. We apply it successfully in estimating the unknown
   parameters of an autonomous chaotic laser system derived from
   Maxwell-Bloch equations. Numerical results and comparison demonstrate
   that for the given system parameters, CMS-PSO can identify the optimized
   parameters effectively evolving at each iteration to attain the pareto
   optimal solution with small population size and enhanced convergence
   speedup. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},
