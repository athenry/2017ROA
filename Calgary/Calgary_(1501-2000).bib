Abstract = {{The simulation of the coal gasification process in a bubbling fluidized
   bed reactor was performed in order to estimate the performance of the
   gasifier and assess the optimal operating conditions. A
   Eulerian-Eulerian computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation has been
   developed to predict the hydrodynamic behaviour of the fluidization
   regime in the bed. This not only provides insight into the hydrodynamics
   of the bubbling fluidized bed reactor, but also yields hydrodynamics
   parameters, such as bubble diameter and velocity, solid volume fraction,
   velocity of gas and solid particles, which can be subsequently used for
   reaction modelling of the coal gasification process. The predicted
   hydrodynamic parameters from the CFD simulation are integrated into the
   kinetics of gasification chemical reactions taking place in the bubble,
   cloud, and emulsion phases. Instantaneous devolatilization and drying of
   the feedstock are also considered in the model. The comparison of the
   predicted results with experimental measurements showed that most of the
   predicted molar gas compositions in the produced gas were within 15\% of
   the experimental data. The model was further used to predict the
   performance of the gasifier at different operating conditions. The
   results indicated that the temperature range of 800-850 degrees C,
   steam-to-coal ratios of 0.5-1.5 kg/kg, and air-to-coal ratios of 2.0-2.5
   kg/kg are suitable conditions for syngas (hydrogen and carbon monoxide,
   H-2+CO) production. Depending on the application of the produced syngas,
   the required H-2-to-CO ratio can be achieved by controlling the air-and
   steam-to-coal ratios.}},

Abstract = {{Precise point positioning (PPP) integer ambiguity resolution with a
   single receiver can be achieved using advanced satellite augmentation
   corrections. Several PPP integer ambiguity resolution methods have been
   developed, which include the decoupled clock model, the
   single-difference between-satellites model, and the integer phase clock
   model. Although similar positioning performances have been demonstrated,
   very few efforts have been made to explore the relationship between
   those methods. Our aim is to compare the three PPP integer ambiguity
   resolution methods for their equivalence. First, several assumptions
   made in previous publications are clarified. A comprehensive comparison
   is then conducted using three criteria: the integer property recovery,
   the system redundancy, and the necessary corrections through which the
   equivalence of these three PPP integer ambiguity resolution methods in
   the user solution is obtained.}},

Abstract = {{An aortic aneurysm is a permanent and localized dilatation of the aorta
   resulting from an irreversible loss of structural integrity of the
   aortic wall. The infrarenal segment of the abdominal aorta is the most
   common site of aneurysms; however, they are also common in the ascending
   and descending thoracic aorta. Many cases remain undetected because
   thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) are usually asymptomatic until
   complications such as aortic dissection or rupture occurs. Clinical
   estimates of rupture potential and dissection risk, and thus
   interventional planning for TAAs, are currently based primarily on the
   maximum diameter and growth rate. The growth rate is calculated from
   maximum diameter measurements at two subsequent time points; however,
   this measure cannot reflect the complex changes of vessel wall
   morphology and local areas of weakening that underline the strong
   regional heterogeneity of TAA. Due to the high risks associated with
   both open and endovascular repair, an intervention is only justified if
   the risk for aortic rupture or dissection exceeds the interventional
   risks. Consequently, TAAs clinical management remains a challenge, and
   new methods are needed to better identify patients for elective repair.
   We reviewed the pathophysiology of TAAs and the role of mechanical
   stresses and mathematical growth models in TAA management; as a proof of
   concept, we applied a multiscale biomechanical analysis to a case study
   of TAA.}},

Journal = {{BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY}},

Pages = {{344-351}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Aerobic granulation is an advanced biological wastewater treatment
   technology. This study for the first time identified the microbial
   communities of sliced samples of mature granules by polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) amplification and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis
   (DGGE) technique and those of whole growing granules by high-throughput
   sequencing technique. The sliced sample study revealed that mature
   granules have a spherical core with anaerobic Rhodocyclaceae covered by
   an outer spherical shell with both aerobic and anaerobic strains. The
   growing granule study showed that the flocculated flocs were first
   transited to young granules with increased abundances of
   Flavobacteriaceae, Xanthomonadaceae, Rhodobacteraceae and
   Microbacteriaceae, then the abundances of anaerobic strains were
   increased owing to the formation of anaerobic core. Since the present
   granules were cultivated from flocculated flocs, the microbial community
   data suggested that granules were formed via a deterministic rather than
   via a random aggregation-disintegration mechanism. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We have demonstrated previously that chondral damage is associated with
   increased knee surface velocities following ligament and meniscus
   injuries in sheep. We tested the hypothesis that cartilage damage scores
   would correlate with a new bone surface interaction measure that
   captures complex changes in tibiofemoral alignment, ``proximity
   disturbance{''} (PD). Six sheep underwent combined anterior cruciate and
   medial collateral ligament transection (ACL/MCLx), five complete lateral
   meniscectomy (Mx), and four sham arthrotomy (Sham). Tibiofemoral
   subchondral bone surfaces were modeled, and the post-operative changes
   in relative separation of the surfaces (i.e., ``proximity{''}) were
   derived from subject-specific in vivo 3D stifle kinematics. Surface
   areas of regions of near contact were determined, and PD was calculated
   as the range of change in tibiofemoral proximity, divided by normalized
   overlapping proximity surface areas between baseline and post-operative
   time points. Cartilage morphology was graded at dissection. ACL/MCLx PD
   was significantly elevated relative to Mx and Shams, and correlated with
   cartilage damage (r(2) 0.88-0.98). Although not statistically
   significant, Mx PD values tended to be higher than those of Shams, and
   correlated with cartilage damage. Results from both injury models
   suggest that increasing change in tibiofemoral surface alignment may be
   increasingly deleterious to long-term cartilage health in sheep. (C)

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{22}},

Pages = {{13-20}},

Abstract = {{Water pumping is one of the oldest uses of wind energy with the
   multi-bladed, high-solidity windmill still in widespread use. In
   contrast to the low-solidity, high-speed blades of modern wind turbines
   which use airfoil profiles, windmills typically employ thin,
   circular-arc blades at high solidity and low speed. While there is
   considerable data on the aerodynamic behavior of circular arc airfoils
   (of zero solidity) there is very little data on cascades of circular arc
   blades. This paper investigates computationally the effects of solidity
   on the lift and drag of thin, circular arc blades in preparation for a
   detailed blade element analysis of windmill performance. Typical
   Reynolds numbers, Re, for windmills are around 10(5), so modeling of
   laminar separation and transition was expected to be as important as
   modeling the subsequent turbulent flow. The SST-transition model was,
   therefore, used. The ``constants{''} in the transition equations were
   adjusted to match surface pressure measurements on circular arc airfoils
   at Re = 62,000, and then compared to separate measurements of the lift
   and drag at Re = 10(5). Excellent agreement was found in the former but
   the agreement for the latter was poorer. Computational modeling of
   solidity showed significant variation in the lift and drag which should
   be included in a blade element calculation. Crown Copyright (C) 2014

Abstract = {{A multiplierless architecture based on algebraic integer representation
   for computing the Daubechies 4-tap wavelet transform for 1-D/2-D signal
   processing is proposed. This architecture improves on previous designs
   in a sense that it minimizes the number of parallel 2-input adder
   circuits. The algorithm was achieved using numerical optimization based
   o exhaustive search over the algebraic integer representation. The
   proposed architecture furnishes exact computation up to the final
   reconstruction step, which is the operation that maps the exactly
   computed filtered results from algebraic integer representation to
   fixed-point. Compared to Madishetty et al. (IEEE Trans Circuits Syst I
   (Accepted, In Press), 2012a), this architecture shows a reduction of
   adder circuits, where is the number of wavelet decomposition levels.
   Standard images Mandrill, Lena, and Cameraman were submitted to digital
   realizations of both proposed algebraic integer based as well as
   fixed-point schemes, leading to quantifiable comparisons. The design is
   physically implemented for a 4-level 2-D decomposition using a Xilinx
   Virtex-6 vcx240t-1ff1156 FPGA device operating at up to a maximum clock
   frequency of 263.15 MHz. The FPGA implementation is tested using
   hardware co-simulation using an ML605 board with clock of 100 MHz. A 45
   nm CMOS synthesis shows improved clock frequency of better than 500 MHz

Abstract = {{Background: Joint diseases such as osteoarthritis (OA) predominantly
   afflict post-menopausal women, suggesting a pertinent role for female
   hormones. Estrogen receptor beta (ER-beta) has been detected in
   connective tissues of the knee joint suggesting that these tissues are
   responsive to the hormone estrogen. Matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1)
   activity contributes to cartilage degradation, a key factor leading to
   OA development in synovial joints. Two polymorphic forms of MMP-1 exist
   due to a deletion/insertion of the guanine residue in the promoter, and
   the 2G allelic variant of MMP-1 exhibits more activity than the 1G
   allele. Previous studies have demonstrated that the polymorphic forms of
   the human MMP-1 are influenced by the modulating effects of estrogen
   receptor isoforms. In addition to hormonal influences, physiological
   factors such as altered mechanical loading are also contributory
   features of OA. In the present study, the combined influence of
   biomechanical and hormonal variables on the activity of MMP-1 isoforms
   was evaluated. We hypothesized that the combined effects of ER-beta and
   sheer stress will differentially activate the two allelic forms of MMP-1
   in a hormone-independent manner.
   Methods: HIG-82 synoviocytes were transiently transfected with 1G or 2G
   alleles (+/-) ER-beta and subjected to either shear or equibiaxial
   stress. Next, 1G/2G promoter activity was measured to determine the
   combined influence of physiological stimuli. Truncated ER-beta
   constructs were used to determine the importance of different domains of
   ER-beta on 1G/2G activation.
   Results: The 2G allele exhibited a constitutively higher activity than
   the 1G allele, which was further increased when the transfected cells
   were subject to shear stress, but not equibiaxial stress. Moreover, the
   combination of ER-beta and shear stress further increased the activity
   levels of the 1G/2G allelic variants. Additionally, select AF-2
   truncated ER-beta variants led to increased activity levels for the 2G
   allele, indicating the AF-1 domain was likely involved in the response
   to mechanical stimulation.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that the 1G/2G alleles of MMP-1 are
   influenced by specific mechanical stimuli like shear stress, as well as
   the ER-beta receptor. These findings contribute to the potential allelic
   involvement in connective tissue diseases such as OA in females compared
   to males.}},

Abstract = {{The intrinsic permeability of bone plays an important role in the
   transport of nutrients and minerals within the tissue, and affects the
   mechanical stimuli that are related to the fate of the stem cells. The
   objective of this study was to establish a method to assess trabecular
   bone permeability using experimental and finite element (FE) modeling
   approaches based on micro computed tomography (mu CT) images. Human
   cadaveric tibia cube specimens (N=23) were scanned with gCT. The
   permeability was measured experimentally using a custom-developed
   constant-head permeameter, and computationally by a poroelastic
   formulation to simulate the fluid flow within the discretized bone
   matrix and pore phase. The average of the experimentally measured
   permeability was 4.84 x 10(-10) m(2) with a standard deviation of 3.70 x
   10(-10) m(2). A regression model of the pCT determined that the maximum
   bone area to total area ratio (maxBA/TA) for all slices that are
   perpendicular to the direction of fluid flow explained 84\% of the
   variability of the natural logarithm of the experimentally measured
   permeability. The 2D measure of maxBA/TA performed better than 3D
   measures in general, although some parameters were reasonably well
   associated with permeability such as bone volume ratio (BV/TV, r=-0.71),
   the bone surface/bone volume (BS/BV, r=0.73), and the trabecular
   thickness (TbTh, r=-0.71). The correlation between the permeability
   predicted with FE models and experimentally measured permeability was
   reasonable (r=0.69), but the FE approach did not accurately represent
   the wide variability of permeability measured experimentally. The
   results of this study suggest that the changes in the trabecular bone
   microarchitecture have an exponential relationship with permeability,
   and the use of ACT-based 2D measurement of maxBA/TA performs well at
   predicting permeability, thus providing a convenient approach to measure
   this important aspect affecting biomechanical functions in the tissue.

Abstract = {{Rationale: T-type (Ca(V)3.1/Ca(V)3.2) Ca2+ channels are expressed in rat
   cerebral arterial smooth muscle. Although present, their functional
   significance remains uncertain with findings pointing to a variety of
   roles.
   Objective: This study tested whether Ca(V)3.2 channels mediate a
   negative feedback response by triggering Ca2+ sparks, discrete events
   that initiate arterial hyperpolarization by activating large-conductance
   Ca2+-activated K+ channels.
   Methods and Results: Micromolar Ni2+, an agent that selectively blocks
   Ca(V)3.2 but not Ca(V)1.2/Ca(V)3.1, was first shown to
   depolarize/constrict pressurized rat cerebral arteries; no effect was
   observed in Ca(V)3.2(-/-) arteries. Structural analysis using
   3-dimensional tomography, immunolabeling, and a proximity ligation assay
   next revealed the existence of microdomains in cerebral arterial smooth
   muscle which comprised sarcoplasmic reticulum and caveolae. Within these
   discrete structures, Ca(V)3.2 and ryanodine receptor resided in close
   apposition to one another. Computational modeling revealed that Ca2+
   influx through Ca(V)3.2 could repetitively activate ryanodine receptor,
   inducing discrete Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release events in a
   voltage-dependent manner. In keeping with theoretical observations,
   rapid Ca2+ imaging and perforated patch clamp electrophysiology
   demonstrated that Ni2+ suppressed Ca2+ sparks and consequently
   spontaneous transient outward K+ currents, large-conductance
   Ca2+-activated K+ channel mediated events. Additional functional work on
   pressurized arteries noted that paxilline, a large-conductance
   Ca2+-activated K+ channel inhibitor, elicited arterial constriction
   equivalent, and not additive, to Ni2+. Key experiments on human cerebral
   arteries indicate that Ca(V)3.2 is present and drives a comparable
   response to moderate constriction.
   Conclusions: These findings indicate for the first time that Ca(V)3.2
   channels localize to discrete microdomains and drive ryanodine
   receptor-mediated Ca2+ sparks, enabling large-conductance Ca2+-activated
   K+ channel activation, hyperpolarization, and attenuation of cerebral
   arterial constriction.}},

Abstract = {{Layered double hydroxide (LDH) materials comprising of Mg/Al, Ni/Al and

   properties of the LDH materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction
   (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and N-2 adsorption-desorption
   techniques. It was found that the three LDHs with different divalent
   metal cations were constructed from nanosheets with well-defined shapes
   and sizes. Adsorption rates and isotherms of the LDH adsorbents for
   Cr(VI) were investigated in batch experiments. Desorption behaviors and
   regeneration of Cr(VI)-adsorbed LDHs at the solid liquid interface were
   also studied. The ZnAl-LDH exhibited excellent sorption capacity (68.07
   mg/g) for Cr(VI) and good regeneration performance. The effect of
   coexisting anions on the adsorption performance revealed that the anions
   (CO32-, HCO3-) greater impact on the adsorption process due to their

Abstract = {{The effect of an upstream obstacle - a backward-facing step (BFS) - on a
   very low head (VLH) water-turbine model has been investigated. The
   motivation of this study was to quantify the interaction between the VLH
   turbine and BFS, an abstraction of typical obstacles present in existing
   channels. Power measurements were obtained for three configurations; the
   turbine in the absence of the BFS was first examined as a baseline test,
   followed by configurations with the BFS placed at distances of half a
   turbine diameter and one turbine diameter upstream. It was found that
   turbine efficiency is comparable between the case with no step upstream
   and when the step is placed at one diameter. However, the configuration
   at half a diameter exhibited an efficiency deficit of approximately 7\%.
   Particle image velocimetry measurements were then used to quantity the
   flowfield associated with loss in efficiency from the no step to the
   half a diameter step configuration. It was determined that the losses
   could be attributed to a highly non-uniform inlet velocity profile,
   which results in unsteady loading across the turbine blades.}},

Abstract = {{In modern communication systems, nonlinearity in power amplifiers (PAs)
   and in-phase and quadrature-phase (I/Q) imperfections in the transmitter
   are of enormous concern. With the increase in the importance for highly
   energy efficient and low complexity models, there is a need to develop
   low complexity digital predistortion (DPD) methods. In this paper, we
   present a novel memory polynomial based distributed two block model to
   alleviate these impairments. Various performance metrics are used to
   evaluate the design performance and complexity of proposed model as
   compared to the state of the art predistorter model. Simulation and
   measurement results indicate the ability of the proposed model to meet
   the desired design purpose with reduced complexity in terms of number of
   coefficients, dispersion coefficient, condition number and number of
   floating points operations required for computing various steps in the
   inverse modeling algorithm. This is achieved while maintaining
   reasonable performances in terms of NMSE and ACEPR. The major attribute
   of the model is the reduction in complexity of the system. The number of
   complex valued coefficients and the number of floating point operations
   (FLOPs) are both reduced by 17\%-56\%, matrix conditioning is improved
   by 12-33 dB and the dispersion coefficient is reduced by 16-42 dB as
   compared to the previously proposed joint modulator and power
   compensation technique.}},

Abstract = {{It is often advocated that a solution to the problem of interference to
   digital subscriber line networks (DSL) from a power line communications
   (PLC) network is to prevent the PLC networks from utilizing the DSL
   spectrum. However, this solution will render PLC networks inoperable
   with the introduction of wide-band DSL technology like G. Fast. We
   propose utilizing an interference cancelling scheme to ensure the
   co-existence of DSL and PLC networks within the home environment. A
   measurement campaign is conducted where a set of 480 measurements are
   collected within a residential house to characterize the PLC-to-DSL
   interference environment for two DSL modem installation scenarios. The
   interference cancelling scheme is based on an adaptive frequency domain
   interference canceller (FDIC) that utilizes the common mode (CM) PLC
   interference to estimate the differential mode (DM) PLC interference.
   The effectiveness of the FDIC, which is insensitive to the
   non-stationarity of the PLC channel, is demonstrated using analysis that
   incorporates the measured PLC-to-DSL coupling channels.}},

Abstract = {{Implant malalignment in hip arthroplasty increases the risk of revision
   surgery due to problems such as hip instability, wear, and impingement.
   Traditional instrumentation lacks accuracy and does not individualize
   the goal. Computer-assisted surgery (CAS) and patient-specific solutions
   improve accuracy but add considerably to the cost, amongst other
   drawbacks. We developed an adjustable mechanical device, called Optihip,
   which is set to a patient-specific goal preoperatively and is
   independent of pelvis position intraoperatively. The purpose of the
   present study was to evaluate Optihip's accuracy ex vivo. Acetabular
   components were implanted into six cadaveric specimens, 12 hips, by two
   surgeons, with the device individually adjusted according to
   preoperative templating on computed tomography (CT) images relative to
   defined acetabular rim landmarks; options also exist for templating on
   single or biplanar X-rays. Intraoperatively, the device was positioned
   on the corresponding anatomical landmarks allowing the insertion of a
   guide pin, which then defined the desired orientation of the acetabular
   cup during impaction. Mean absolute difference between the
   preoperatively planned cup alignment and final acetabular cup
   orientation, measured from postoperative CT images, was 2.5 +/- 1.2
   degrees for inclination and 2.5 +/- 2.2 degrees for version with maximum
   values of 4.7 degrees and 6.8 degrees, respectively. Compared with
   previous in vivo reports, Optihip guided the acetabular cup orientation
   more accurately than conventional hip arthroplasty, and comparably to
   CAS or patient-specific systems, while fitting into the normal surgical
   workflow. Although clinical testing is required to confirm these
   experimental results, the positive ex vivo accuracy suggests good
   potential for improving revision rates and patient functional outcome.}},

Abstract = {{New technological challenges in oil production require materials that
   can resist high temperature oxidation. In-Situ Combustion (ISC) oil
   production technique is a new method that uses injection of air and
   ignition techniques to reduce the viscosity of bitumen in a reservoir
   and as a result crude bitumen can be produced and extracted from the
   reservoir. During the in-situ combustion process, production pipes and
   other mechanical components can be exposed to air-like gaseous
   environments at extreme temperatures as high as 700 degrees C. To
   protect or reduce the surface degradation of pipes and mechanical
   components used in in-situ combustion, the use of nickel-based
   ceramic-metallic (cermet) coating produced by co-electrodeposition of
   nanosized Al2O3 and TiO2 have been suggested and earlier research on
   these coatings have shown promising oxidation resistance against
   atmospheric oxygen and combustion gases at elevated temperatures.
   Co-electrodeposition of nickel-based cermet coatings is a low-cost
   method that has the benefit of allowing both internal and external
   surfaces of pipes and components to be coated during a single
   electroplating process. Research has shown that the volume fraction of
   dispersed nanosized Al2O3 and TiO2 particles in the nickel matrix which
   affects the oxidation resistance of the coating can be controlled by the
   concentration of these particles in the electrolyte solution, as well as
   the applied current density during electrodeposition. This paper
   investigates the high temperature oxidation behaviour of novel
   nanostructured cermet coatings composed of two types of dispersed
   nanosized ceramic particles (Al2O3 and TiO2) in a nickel matrix and
   produced by co-electrodeposition technique as a function of the
   concentration of these particles in the electrolyte solution and applied
   current density. For this purpose, high temperature oxidation tests were
   conducted in dry air for 96 hours at 700 degrees C to obtain mass
   changes (per unit of area) at specific time intervals. Statistical
   techniques as described in ASTM G16 were used to formulate the oxidation
   mass change as a function of time. The cross-section and surface of the
   oxidized coatings were examined for both visual and chemical analyses
   using wavelength dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (WDS) element mapping,
   X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).
   The results showed that the volume fraction for each type of particle in
   the nickel matrix corresponded to its partial molar concentration in the
   electrolyte solutions. Increase in volume fraction of particles in the
   nickel matrix was correlated to lower oxidation rates. It was concluded
   that formation of Ni3TiO5 and NiTiO3 compounds can reduce the oxidation
   rate of cermet coatings by capturing some inward diffusing oxygen ions
   resulting in a lower number of nickel cations diffusing upward into the
   oxide layer.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal treatment and pyrolysis of vacuum residue/fraction oil blends
   have been conducted to quantitatively study the effect of the fraction
   oils recycle (i.e. the composition and the ratio of recycled fraction
   oils) on the stability of blends. The thermal treatment was completed in
   a static autoclave and the pyrolysis was run at 500 degrees C according
   to a standard test (i.e. the MCR test, ASTM D4530). The pyrolysis
   coupled with the polarized light microscopic observation of the coke
   products provided a quantitative and convenient method for predictive
   assessment of the stability of a given feed. It was strongly suggested
   that atmospheric gas oil distillate (AGO) was not conducive to the
   stability of blends. The recycle ratio of AGO and light vacuum gas oil
   distillate (LVGO) had better be confined to around 0.1 and the valid
   upper limitation of recycle ratio for heavy vacuum gas oil distillate
   (HVGO) could be increased up to 0.6 for the purpose of digesting
   ill-processable vacuum gas oil fraction (VGO). It was concluded that
   appropriate selection of recycled fraction and ratio might not only
   favor the improvement of coking products distribution and the process
   capacity debottleneck, but also be beneficial for maintaining the
   stability of coking feedstock, suppressing asphaltenes-involved phase
   separation in the exchanger sections at high temperature, and
   consequentially favor the operation period extending of coking plants.

Abstract = {{This paper looks at the problem of controlling an incinerator that burns
   waste gas to generate power. The system is modelled as a standard
   utility boiler using one known and one unknown (waste) fuel input.
   Standard linear controls have trouble dealing with large variations in
   the waste input, and in practice boiler shutdowns can occur. In this
   work, a nonlinear adaptive control design accounts for uncertainty in
   the plant parameters, and an adaptive neural-network estimates the
   effect of the waste input. Since a linear observer design cannot
   guarantee convergence away from a set point, a novel nonlinear observer
   design provides estimates of the states. The observer design uses
   fictitious states to estimate nonlinear terms in the observer dynamics.
   The analysis guarantees Lyapunov stability, thus the observer bounds
   depend on the accuracy of the observer initial conditions. Simulation
   results show the proposed method can obtain accurate performance and
   stability, improving over results obtained withproportional-integral
   control.}},

Abstract = {{Aims To elucidate the properties of the PMJ and myocardium underlying
   these effects. Transmural heterogeneity of action potential duration
   (APD) is known to play an important role in arrhythmogenesis. Regions of
   non-uniformities of APD gradients often overlap considerably with the
   location of Purkinje-muscle junctions (PMJs). We therefore hypothesized
   that such junctions are novel sources of local endocardial and
   transmural heterogeneity of repolarization, and that remodelling due to
   heart failure modulates this response.
   Methods and results Spatial gradients of endocardial APD in left
   ventricular wedge preparations from healthy sheep (n = 5) were
   correlated with locations of PMJs identified through Purkinje
   stimulation under optical mapping. APD prolongation was dependent on
   proximity of the PMJ to the imaged surface, whereby shallow PMJs
   significantly modulated local APD when stimulating either Purkinje (P =
   0.0116) or endocardium (P = 0.0123). In addition, we model a PMJ in 5 x
   5 x 10 mm transmural tissue wedges using healthy and novel failing human
   ventricular and Purkinje ionic models. Short distances of the PMJ to cut
   surfaces (<0.875 mm) revealed that APD maxima were localized to the PMJ
   in healthy myocardium, whereas APD minima were observed in failing
   myocardium. Amplitudes and spatial gradients of APD were prominent at
   functional PMJs and quiescent PMJs. Furthermore, increasing the extent
   of Purkinje fibre branching or decreasing tissue conductivity augmented
   local APD prolongation in both failing and non-failing models.
   Conclusions The Purkinje network has the potential to influence
   myocardial AP morphology and rate-dependent behaviour, and furthermore
   to underlie enhanced transmural APD heterogeneities and spatial
   gradients of APD in non-failing and failing myocardium.}},

Abstract = {{Natural rock, such as sandstone, has a large number of discontinuous,
   multi-scale, geometry-irregular pores, forming a complex porous
   structure. This porous structure essentially determines the rock's
   physical and/or mechanical properties, which are of great significance
   to a variety of applications in the fields of science and engineering.
   As a supplement to experimental observation, a reliable reconstruction
   model of porous structure could provide an effective and economical way
   to characterize the physical and mechanical properties of a porous rock.
   In this paper, we present a novel method for reconstructing the
   well-connected porous structure of sandstones, which are often
   intractable to handle for current reconstruction methods. A fractal
   descriptor is here proposed for better characterizing complex pore
   morphologies. The reconstruction procedure of a 3D well-connected porous
   structure is optimized by integrating the improved simulated annealing
   algorithm and the fractal system control function. The proposed
   reconstruction method enables us to represent a large-size 3D porous
   structure. To verify the accuracy of reconstruction, we have analyzed
   the geometrical, topological, and mechanical properties of the
   reconstructed porous medium and compared them with those of prototype
   rock samples. The comparisons show good agreement between the
   reconstructed model and the real porous sandstone. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A significant amount of oil is trapped by the continuous water phase in
   water-wet reservoirs during waterflooding and CO2 water-alternating-gas
   (WAG) flooding processes. In tertiary CO2 injection, such a phenomenon
   may cause part of the residual oil to be inaccessible to the injected
   CO2 and remain trapped by water. As a result, the displacement
   efficiency of the CO2 WAG process is reduced, as is the oil recovery.
   This paper discusses the experimental investigation of a method of
   pre-flushing the reservoir using active carbonated water (ACW) before a
   CO2 flood. A total of 10 coreflood tests were conducted to investigate
   the effects of different injection strategies, slug sizes, and core
   lengths on the tertiary oil recovery. A comparison of the four
   laboratory tests with different injection strategies demonstrates that
   applying the active carbonated water as a pre-flush before a CO2 flood
   is an effective strategy for enhancing the tertiary oil recovery. Oil
   recovery was increased by 35.5\%, compared to 16.6\% from injecting CO2
   alone. Results of the other seven tests using different slug sizes of
   active carbonate water indicate that the optimal slug size of 0.6 pore
   volume (PV) achieved the maximum improvement in oil recovery of CO2
   injection. In addition, a test in a longer core shows the extension of
   core length does not influence the oil recovery, which indicates the
   adsorption of surfactant is not significant in this study. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Complete segmentation of diseased lung lobes by automatically

   surfaces from partial fissures found in individual computed tomography

   different diseases, our algorithm produced root-mean square errors of
   2.21 +/- 1.21, 2.51 +/- 1.36, and 2.38 +/- 1.27 mm for segmenting the
   left oblique fissure (LOF), right oblique fissure (ROF) and right

   segmenting the LOF, ROF, and RHF are 86.59\%, 84.80\%, and 82.62\%,

Abstract = {{Conventional haemodynamic analysis of pulmonary venous and left atrial
   (LA) pressure waveforms yields substantial forward and backward waves
   throughout the cardiac cycle; the reservoir wave model provides an
   alternative analysis with minimal waves during diastole. Pressure and
   flow in a single pulmonary vein (PV) and the main pulmonary artery (PA)
   were measured in anaesthetized dogs and the effects of hypoxia and
   nitric oxide, volume loading, and positive-end expiratory pressure
   (PEEP) were observed. The reservoir wave model was used to determine the
   reservoir contribution to PV pressure and flow. Subtracting reservoir
   pressure and flow resulted in excess' quantities which were treated as
   wave-related. Wave intensity analysis of excess pressure and flow
   quantified the contributions of waves originating upstream (from the PA)
   and downstream (from the LA and/or left ventricle (LV)). Major features
   of the characteristic PV waveform are caused by sequential LA and LV
   contraction and relaxation creating backward compression (i.e.
   pressure-increasing) waves followed by decompression (i.e.
   pressure-decreasing) waves. Mitral valve opening is linked to a
   backwards decompression wave (i.e. diastolic suction). During late
   systole and early diastole, forward waves originating in the PA are
   significant. These waves were attenuated less with volume loading and
   delayed with PEEP. The reservoir wave model shows that the forward and
   backward waves are negligible during LV diastasis and that the changes
   in pressure and flow can be accounted for by the discharge of upstream
   reservoirs. In sharp contrast, conventional analysis posits forward and
   backward waves such that much of the energy of the forward wave is
   opposed by the backward wave.}},

Abstract = {{Determining the best way to efficiently use limited water resources, for
   food and energy-dedicated crops, has become crucial due to the rise in
   extreme events (floods/droughts) and higher variability in rainfall
   attributed to global climate change. Changing climate conditions will
   require new crops to be adapted to a changing agricultural environment.
   Reliable information on seasonal trends in crop growth and
   evapotranspiration with associated uncertainty/confidence ranges is
   crucial to guide the development of new crops and management strategies
   to cope with future climate. Given that crop growth is strongly coupled
   to soil moisture, developing reliable growth curves requires a detailed
   understanding of soil moisture at the field-scale. Typically, it is
   impractical to collect soil samples to adequately assess soil moisture
   that represents both spatial distribution at the field-scale and
   temporal dynamics on the scale of a growing season (e.g. 110 days for
   cereals). A novel way to address soil moisture monitoring challenges is
   through an integrated, agro-ecosystems-level approach using an
   integrated sensing system that can link data from multiple platforms
   (wireless sensors, satellites, airborne imagery, near real-time climate
   stations). Assimilated data can, then, be fed into predictive models to
   generate reference crop growth curves and predict regionally-specific
   yield potentials. However, integrated sensing requires interagency
   cooperation, common data processing standards and long-term, timely
   access to data. Large databases need to be reusable by various
   organizations and accessible, in the future, with comprehensive
   metadata. During the 2012 growing season a feasibility study was
   conducted which involved measuring field-scale soil moisture with sensor
   network technology. The experiment utilized radially-distributed sensors
   for tracking in-season soil moisture. OpenGIS-compliant services and
   standards were utilized to provide long-term access to sensor data and
   construct corresponding metadata. Sensor Model Language, an
   inter-operable metadata format, was used to create documentation for the
   sensor system and sensing components. Two different third party
   implementations of the Sensor Observation Service were tested for
   providing long-term access to the data. This work discusses a set of key
   recommendations for monitoring field-scale soil moisture dynamics for
   integration with remote sensing and models, including: (1) Improved in
   situ sensing technology that would allow for less restrictive soil
   moisture measurements. (2) Integration of field-scale in situ networks
   with regional remote sensing monitoring. (3) The development of software
   and web services to integrate data from multiple sources with models for
   decision support. (C) 2014 Crown Copyright and Elsevier B.V. Published

Abstract = {{In fractured reservoirs, some dynamic behavior, such as fracture opening
   or closure and fracture shear dilation, is induced by the variation of
   pressure and in-situ stress, which is associated with the fracture
   aperture and conductivity. In this paper, we focus on the dynamic
   behavior of fractures and various kinds of affecting factors, including
   in-situ stress, lithology and fluid pressure. A mathematical model for
   numerical simulation of the fracture dynamic behavior is developed,
   which consists of a matrix-fracture stress-strain model and a
   matrix-fracture flow model. The stress-strain model of fractures is
   derived, which contains two sections of shear dilation: before-peak
   dilation and after-peak shear dilation. Then a discrete fracture network
   (DFN) technology is used to depict the shape of fractures in reality and
   the model is solved by the finite element method to investigate what the
   range-ability the fracture aperture presents under the influence of the
   affecting factors. Based on this model, the effects of pressure
   distribution, Ethology, anisotropic in-situ stress and well production
   proration are investigated and the specific effects by different
   affecting factors are analyzed. The numerical outcome indicates that the
   fracture aperture increases as the field pressure rises. The anisotropic
   in-situ stress and water injection can trigger large shear dilation,
   which serves as a positive function in fracture opening. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{With the rapid development of the COMPASS system, it is currently
   capable of providing regional navigation services. In order to test its
   data quality and performance for single point positioning (SPP),
   experiments have been conducted under different observing conditions
   including open sky, under trees, nearby a glass wall, nearby a large
   area of water, under high-voltage lines and under a signal transmitting
   tower. To assess the COMPASS data quality, the code multipath, cycle
   slip occurrence rate and data availability were analyzed and compared to
   GPS data. The datasets obtained from the experiments have also been
   utilized to perform combined GPS/COMPASS SPP on an epoch-by-epoch basis
   using unsmoothed single-frequency code observations. The investigation
   on the regional navigation performance aims at low-accuracy applications
   and all tests are made in Changsha, China, using the ``SOUTH S82-C{''}
   GPS/COMPASS receivers. The results show that adding COMPASS observations
   can significantly improve the positioning accuracy of single-frequency
   GPS-only SPP in environments with limited satellite visibility. Since
   the COMPASS system is still in an initial operational stage, all results
   are obtained based on a fairly limited amount of data. (C) 2013 COSPAR.

   widely used for characterizing biological tissues and biochemical
   materials. In this work, a nonlinear least squares fitting is applied to
   extract the double-dispersion Cole impedance parameters from simulated

   or phase information. The technique is applied to extract the impedance
   parameters from MATLAB simulated noisy magnitude datasets showing less
   than 1.2 \% relative error when 60 dB SNR Gaussian white noise is
   present. This extraction is verified experimentally using apples as the
   Cole impedances showing less than 3 \% relative error between simulated
   responses (using the extracted impedance parameters) and the
   experimental results over the entire dataset.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{67}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{911-925}},

Abstract = {{The BeiDou system has been providing a regional navigation service since
   27 December 2012. The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) user
   community will benefit from combined Global Positioning System
   (GPS)/BeiDou positioning due to improved positioning accuracy,
   reliability and availability. But to achieve the best positioning
   solutions, precise weights of the GPS and BeiDou observations are
   important since this involves the processing of measurements from two
   different satellite systems with different quality. Currently, a priori
   variances are typically used to determine the weights of different types
   of observations. However, such an approach may not be precise since many
   un-modelled errors are not accounted for. The Helmert variance component
   estimation method is more appropriate in this case to determine the
   weights of GPS and BeiDou observations. This requires high redundant
   observations in order to obtain reliable solutions, which will be a
   concern in the case of insufficient numbers of visible satellites. To
   address this issue, a weighting approach is proposed by a combination of
   the Helmert method and a moving-window average filter. In this approach,
   the filter is applied to combine all epoch-by-epoch weight estimates
   within a time window. As a result, more precise and reliable weights for
   GPS and BeiDou observations can be obtained at every epoch. Both static
   and kinematic tests in open sky and under tree environments are
   conducted to assess the performance of the new weighting approach. The
   results indicate significantly improved positioning accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Trace-gas emissions from animal feeding operations (AFOs) can contribute
   to air quality and global change gases. Previous and current estimated
   gas emissions from AFOs vary widely and many do not consider all forms
   of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) emissions. Studies have found that as
   methanogenesis in the lagoons increased, conversion of ammonium (NH4
   (+)) to dinitrogen (N-2) also increased. The purpose of this research
   was to measure N-2 and CH4 emissions from swine AFOs in three locations
   of the U.S. and to evaluate the possible universal relationship between
   lagoon methanogenesis and the conversion of NH4 (+) to N-2 gas. This
   relationship was tested by measuring N-2 and CH4 emissions in two
   climates at 22 different farms. Methanogenesis was correlated with NH4
   (+)-to-N-2 conversion by a near-constant N-2 to CH4 emissions ratio of
   0.20, regardless of C loading and climatic effects. The process is shown
   to be thermodynamically favored when there is competition between NH4
   (+) oxidizing reactions. Under methanogenic conditions (redox potentials
   of methanogenesis) N-2 production is favorable and
   nitrification/denitrification is not. Thus, N-2 production is stimulated
   in methanogenic conditions. Evaluation of NH3 gas emissions from AFOs
   must consider other N emissions than NH3. Finally, a statistical model
   was developed to estimate methane and N-2 emissions (kg gas ha(-1))
   given feed input per lagoon surface area (kg feed ha(-1)) and local air
   temperature. Further studies are needed to investigate the mechanisms
   involved in manure processing and isolate the favorable mechanisms into
   engineering improved manure processing.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, nanoparticles (NPs) have been established as ideal drug
   delivery vehicles for treating cancer. This is due to the enhanced
   permeability and retention (EPR) effect that is a direct result of the
   angiogenic nature of the tumor tissue and its ability to sequester
   chemotherapeutics from healthy tissues. Ideal drug delivery nanocarriers
   will exploit the EPR effect, accumulate in the tumorous tissue, and be
   able to release the drugs at a high concentration where needed, thereby
   reducing undesirable side effects. In order to determine ideal NP
   qualities that enable drugs to be delivered in such a manner, extensive
   testing in biological systems is required. However, it is impractical to
   study new potential nanocarriers in humans or in mammalian models due to
   the potential adverse consequences, low throughput, and high cost.
   Simpler models would allow for higher throughput screening of
   nanocarrier vehicles. This review outlines the most recent advances in
   alternative model assays and their significance in testing NPs en route
   to the clinic. In decreasing complexity, we examine zebrafish embryos,
   the chorioallantoic membrane of the chicken embryo, multicell static and
   flow-based assays, and single cell assays for efficacy, accuracy and
   utility as predictors for human therapeutic outcomes.}},

Title = {{Performance analysis of statistical optimal data fusion algorithms}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},

Volume = {{277}},
Pages = {{808-824}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Data fusion is widely used in biometric, multi-media signal and image
   processing, and wireless sensor networks. Optimal fusion techniques are
   developed to perform fusion under noisy environments. However, the
   statistical analysis carried out to evaluate the relative merits of
   these optimal methods is very less. The aim of this paper is to fill
   this gap by evaluating four statistical optimal data fusion methods
   namely, the linearly constrained least squares (LCLS) fusion method, the
   covariance intersection (Cl) fusion method, the linearly constrained
   least absolute deviation (CLAD) fusion method, and the constrained least
   square (CLS) fusion method. The CLS fusion method presented here is an
   improved version of the CLAD fusion method. We further analyze the
   performances of these four methods in terms of optimality, unbiased
   estimation, robustness, and complexity. Simulations are used to validate
   the performance of these fusion algorithms. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The advent of multi-core technology motivates new studies to understand
   how efficiently Web servers utilize such hardware. This paper presents a
   detailed performance study of a Web server application deployed on a
   modern eight-core server. Our study shows that default Web server
   configurations result in poor scalability with increasing core counts.
   We study two different types of workloads, namely, a workload with
   intense TCP/IP related OS activity and the SPECweb2009 Support workload
   with more application-level processing. We observe that the scaling
   behaviour is markedly different for these workloads, mainly because of
   the difference in the performance of static and dynamic requests. While
   static requests perform poorly when moving from using one socket to both
   sockets in the system, the converse is true for dynamic requests. We
   show that, contrary to what was suggested by previous work, Web server
   scalability improvement policies need to be adapted based on the type of
   workload experienced by the server. The results of our experiments
   reveal that with workload-specific Web server configuration strategies,
   a multi-core server can be utilized up to 80\% while still serving
   requests without significant queuing delays; utilizations beyond 90\%
   are also possible, while still serving requests with `acceptable'
   response times. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, nC7-asphaltenes adsorption and subsequent catalytic
   oxidation over three transition metal oxide nanoparticles, namely TiO2,
   ZrO2, and CeO2 were investigated. nC7-asphaltenes studied were obtained
   from Athabasca vacuum residue using n-heptane. The adsorption
   equilibrium data of nC7-asphaltenes, dissolved in toluene, fitted very
   well to the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model. The adsorption behavior
   of nC7-asphaltenes appeared to change with the type of adsorbent used.
   It was found that nC7-asphaltenes adsorption at 25 degrees C is metal
   oxide specific and the adsorption capacities ranked in the following
   order: CeO2 > ZrO2 > TiO2. On the other hand the adsorption affinity
   followed the following order: CeO2 > TiO2 > ZrO2. Theoretical
   calculations of the interaction between the Quinolin-65 (Q-65) (a
   compound used as a model asphaltene molecule) and some of the metal
   oxides surfaces were carried out to get more insight into its adsorption
   behavior. Adsorption energies of Q-65 on the surfaces indicated that
   there are different adsorption sites on each metal oxide. To confirm the
   catalytic activity of the selected oxide nanoparticles, the
   nC7-asphaltenes adsorbed onto the transition metal oxide nanopartides
   were subjected to oxidation up to 700 degrees C in a thermogravimetric
   analyzer. All tested nanoparticles showed high catalytic activity for
   post adsorption oxidation. The oxidation kinetics was studied using the
   Ozawa-Flyn-Wall (OFW) corrected method. The mechanism function of the
   nC7-asphaltenes oxidation is strongly dependent on the type of
   nanoparticles. The kinetic oxidation parameters and the transition state
   thermodynamic functions for the oxidation process of nC7-asphaltenes in
   the presence and absence of nanoparticles, to the best of our knowledge,
   are reported for the first time. Among the selected transition metal
   oxide nanoparticles, CeO2 appears to have the lowest values of effective
   activation energy and change in Gibbs free energy of activation (Delta
   G(double dagger)). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Environmental Implications of United States Coal Exports: A Comparative
   Life Cycle Assessment of Future Power System Scenarios}},

Abstract = {{Stricter emissions requirements on coal-fired power plants together with
   low natural gas prices have contributed to a recent decline in the use
   of coal for electricity generation in the United States. Faced with a
   shrinking domestic market, many coal companies are taking advantage of a
   growing coal export market. As a result, U.S. coal exports hit an
   all-time high in 2012, fueled largely by demand in Asia. This paper
   presents a comparative life cycle assessment of two scenarios: a
   baseline scenario in which coal continues to be burned domestically for
   power generation, and an export scenario in which coal is exported to
   Asia. For the coal export scenario we focus on the Morrow Pacific export
   project being planned in Oregon by Ambre Energy that would ship 8.8
   million tons of Powder River Basin (PRB) coal annually to Asian markets
   via rail, river barge, and ocean vessel. Air emissions (SOx, NOx, PM10,
   and CO(2)e) results assuming that the exported coal is burned for
   electricity generation in South Korea are compared to those of a
   business as usual case in which Oregon and Washington's coal plants,
   Boardman and Centralia, are retrofitted to comply with EPA emissions
   standards and continue their coal consumption. Findings show that
   although the environmental impacts of shipping PRB coal to Asia are
   significant, the combination of superior energy efficiency among newer
   South Korean coal-fired power plants and lower emissions from U.S.
   replacement of coal with natural gas could lead to a greenhouse gas
   reduction of 21\% in the case that imported PRB coal replaces other coal
   sources in this Asian country. If instead PRB coal were to replace
   natural gas or nuclear generation in South Korea, greenhouse gas
   emissions per unit of electricity generated would increase. Results are
   similar for other air emissions such as SOx, NOx and PM. This study
   provides a framework for comparing energy export scenarios and
   highlights the importance of complete life cycle assessment in
   determining net emissions effects resulting from energy export projects
   and related policy decisions.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a demulsification treatment process for high pH
   water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions, using low pressure CO2 and demulsifier,
   with optimized temperature and mixing time is designed. The efficacy of
   different acids, including Ha and CH3COOH, are also examined using this
   method, to be compared with the results obtained with CO2 gas. Both the
   demulsifier and CO2 are indispensable in this demulsification treatment
   process. The demulsification efficiency increases rapidly with the
   increase of demulsifier concentration when the initial concentration is
   lower than 120 mg/L. With the further increase of concentration, the
   demulsification efficiency can reach 83\% and remain constant.
   Meanwhile, the demulsification efficiency increases with the increase of
   CO2 pressure. It is found that the optimum CO2 pressure is between SO
   and 200 kPa, with a mixing time of 65-125 min, where a demulsification
   efficiency of approximately 80-90\% can be achieved. Settling under
   elevated temperature (70 degrees C), after CO2 demulsification, is also
   investigated; the results indicate that heating does not improve the
   demulsification efficiency if the pressure is over 500 kPa. Under the
   same conditions, CO2 shows better demulsification efficiency than that
   obtained by HCl and CH3COOH. At a pH of approximately 7.0-7.7, the
   emulsion is the least stable, and the maximum demulsification efficiency
   is obtained.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to develop a method for categorizing
   normal individuals (normal, n = 100) as well as patients with
   osteoarthritis (OA, n = 100), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n = 100)
   based on a panel of inflammatory cytokines expressed in serum samples.
   Two panels of inflammatory proteins were used as training sets in the
   construction of two separate artificial neural networks (ANNs). The
   first training set consisted of all proteins (38 in total) and the
   second consisted of only the significantly different proteins expressed
   (12 in total) between at least two patient groups. Both ANNs obtained
   high levels of sensitivity and specificity, with the first and second
   ANN each diagnosing 100\% of test set patients correctly. These results
   were then verified by re-investigating the entire dataset using a
   decision tree algorithm. We show that ANNs can be used for the accurate
   differentiation between serum samples of patients with OA, a diagnosed
   RA patient comparator cohort and normal/control cohort. Using neural
   network and systems biology approaches to manage large datasets derived

Title = {{Bio-inspired classifier for road extraction from remote sensing imagery}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 5}},
Abstract = {{An adaptive approach for road extraction inspired by the mechanism of
   primary visual cortex (V1) is proposed. The motivation is originated by
   the characteristics in the receptive field from V1. It has been proved
   that human or primate visual systems can distinguish useful cues from
   real scenes effortlessly while traditional computer vision techniques
   cannot accomplish this task easily. This idea motivates us to design a
   bio-inspired model for road extraction from remote sensing imagery. The
   proposed approach is an improved support vector machine (SVM) based on
   the pooling of feature vectors, using an improved Gaussian radial basis
   function (RBF) kernel with tuning on synaptic gains. The synaptic gains
   comprise the feature vectors through an iterative optimization process
   representing the strength and width of Gaussian RBF kernel. The synaptic
   gains integrate the excitation and inhibition stimuli based on internal
   connections from V1. The summation of synaptic gains contributes to
   pooling of feature vectors. The experimental results verify the
   correlation between the synaptic gain and classification rules, and then
   show better performance in comparison with hidden Markov model, SVM, and
   fuzzy classification approaches. Our contribution is an automatic
   approach to road extraction without prelabeling and postprocessing work.
   Another apparent advantage is that our method is robust for images taken
   even under complex weather conditions such as snowy and foggy weather.

Abstract = {{In order to detect small gravity changes in field measurements, such as
   with CO2 storage, we designed simulations and experiments to validate
   the capabilities of the iGrav superconducting gravimeter. Qualified data
   processing was important to obtain the residual gravity from the iGrav's
   raw gravity signals, without the tidal components, atmosphere, polar
   motion and hydrological effects. Two simulations and four designed
   experiments are presented in this study. The first simulation detected
   the gravity change during CO2 injection. The residual gravity of CO2
   leakage was targeted with the second simulation from the main storage
   reservoir to secondary space underground. The designed experiments
   monitored the situation of gravity anomalies in the iGrav's records.
   These tests focused on short-term gravity anomalies, such as gravity
   changes, step functions, repeat observations and gradient measurements
   from the iGrav, rather than on long-term tidal effects. The four
   laboratory experiments detected a decrease in gravity of -0.56 +/- 0.15
   mu Gal (10(-8) m s(-2)) with a 92.8 kg weight on the top of the iGrav. A
   step function occurred in the gravity signals, when the tilt control was
   out of balance. We also used a professional camera dolly with a track to
   observe repeated horizontal movements and an electric lift table for
   controlled vertical movements to measure the average gradient of -2.67
   +/- 0.01 mu Gal cm(-1).}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of this paper were to develop, evaluate, and apply the
   remote sensing based models for Canadian Water Quality Index (CWQI) and
   turbidity for the Bow River of Alberta. We used 31 scenes of Landsat-5
   TM satellite data to establish the relationship between the planetary
   reflectance and the monthly ground measured data for the period of 5
   years (i. e. 2006-2010). The four spectral bands (i. e. blue, green,
   red, and near infrared) were used to obtain the most suitable models
   from 26 different band combinations. The co-efficients of determination
   on the basis of red band were 0.91 for the CWQI model and 0.82 for the
   turbidity model. The best-fit models were validated with ground measured
   data and found that: 72\% of the data showed 100\% matching for the CWQI
   model and 83\% of the data for the turbidity model. The Landsat-5 TM
   based CWQI and turbidity models were applied on all the scenes to obtain
   five CWQI classes (i. e. excellent, good, fair, marginal and poor), and
   six classes of turbidity (i. e. 0-10 NTU, 10-20 NTU, 20-30 NTU, 30-40
   NTU, 40-50 NTU, > 50 NTU). On the basis of percentages obtained for CWQI
   and turbidity classes, the ranks of years in terms of water quality from
   best to worst were: 2009, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2007 respectively. The
   variation of river water quality in different years of interest was
   associated with the climatic changes. The most deteriorated water
   quality noted in two natural sub-regions included mixed grass and dry
   mixed grass, which could be related to irrigation-based farming.}},

Journal = {{ANNALS OF THORACIC SURGERY}},

Volume = {{98}},

Pages = {{447-452}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background. This study aimed to predict variation in the thoracic
   surgery workforce requirements with the introduction of a national chest
   computed tomographic (CT) screening program for individuals at high risk
   of lung cancer.
   Methods. Using Canadian census microdata and the Canadian Community
   Health Survey, a microsimulation model representing the national
   population was developed. The demand component simulates the incidence
   of lung cancer, whereas the supply component simulates the number of
   practicing thoracic surgeons. A national CT screening program in
   high-risk individuals (> 30 pack-year history of smoking; age, 55-74
   years) was introduced into the model to predict changes in the number of
   operable lung cancers per thoracic surgeon.
   Results. From 2013 to 2040, the Canadian population increased from 34 to
   43 million. The number eligible for screening varies from 1,112,800
   (2013) to 513,200 (2040), peaking at 1,147,700 (2017). Comparing CT
   screening with chest radiography, overall lung cancer diagnoses increase
   7.3\% by 2040, with stage 1A increasing by 15.6\% and stage IV
   decreasing by 7.5\%. The rate of operable early lung cancers per
   thoracic surgeon increases by 24.2\% (2020), 19.8\% (2030), and 16\%
   (2040), with CT screening relative to the baseline increase seen with
   chest radiography.
   Conclusions. With the implementation of a CT screening program there
   will be an increase in operable lung cancers, resulting in increased
   surgical volume. A national strategy for the thoracic surgery workforce
   is necessary to ensure that an appropriate number of surgeons are being
   trained to meet the future needs of the national population. (C) 2014 by

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{120}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Permeability variation, particularly in the presence of gas hydrates,
   greatly influences production of natural gas from hydrate reservoirs. A
   series of experiments were performed to investigate the variation of
   permeability in gas hydrates-bearing sediments. Carbon dioxide hydrate
   was formed in Ottawa 20/30 sand samples contained within a rigid cell
   using a partial water saturation formation methodology. Different
   initial water saturations were used to achieve hydrate saturations up to
   45\% and the corresponding water permeability was measured during
   steady-state flow. The experimental permeability results were compared
   with several theoretical models using both the quantitative and
   graphical analyses. A hybrid modeling approach based on the weighted
   combination of grain coating and the pore filling models was used to fit
   the measured experimental data. The experimental results were also
   compared to relevant experimental studies that used similar methods to

Abstract = {{A mathematical model is developed for evaluation of water flooding
   performance in a highly fractured reservoir. The model transforms a
   dual-porosity medium into an equivalent single porosity medium by using
   a pseudo relative permeability method to normalize the relative
   permeability. This approach allows both fractures and matrix to have
   permeability, porosity, endpoint saturation, and endpoint relative
   permeability by themselves. Imbibition is also taken into account by
   modifying Chen's equation. Some effects, including imbibition and
   recovery rates are investigated. The investigation shows that imbibition
   can determine the potential of a fractured reservoir and a low recovery
   rate can improve the water flooding situation in terms of retarding
   water breakthrough and controlling the rise of water cut. A new chart
   composed by water cut vs. recovery curves is protracted to estimate the
   ultimate water-flooding recovery rate. The water flooding performance of
   two reservoirs is evaluated. Compared with numerical simulation method,
   the error of these two cases are not more than 2\%, which proved that
   this method is reliable. Both lab test data and field data are applied
   to a further discussion of the characteristics of water flooding
   performance in fractured reservoirs. On comparison with the classical
   method, such as Tong's method and the X-plot method, the reason why the
   new method is more suitable to fractured reservoirs is addressed by a
   theoretical analysis. An appropriate application of this method can help
   the reservoir engineer to optimize the reservoir management with low
   costs and high efficiency. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents novel minimally-invasive, catheter-based acoustic
   interrogation device for monitoring motility dynamics of the lower
   esophageal sphincter (LES). A micro-oscillator actively emitting sound
   wave at 16 kHz is located at one side of the LES, and a miniature
   microphone is located at the other side of the sphincter to capture the
   sound generated from the oscillator. Thus, the dynamics of the opening
   and closing of the LES can be quantitatively assessed. In this paper,
   experiments are conducted utilizing an LES motility dynamics simulator.
   The sound strength is captured by the microphone and is correlated to
   the level of LES opening and closing controlled by the simulator.
   Measurements from the simulator model show statistically significant (p
   < 0.05) Pearson correlation coefficients (0.905 on the average in quiet
   environment and 0.736 on the average in noisy environment, D.O.F. = 9).
   Measuring the level of LES opening and closing has the potential to
   become a valuable diagnostic technique for understanding LES dysfunction
   and the disorders associated with it.}},

Abstract = {{Consumer-grade digital cameras suffer from geometrical instability that
   may cause problems when used in photogrammetric applications. This paper
   provides a comprehensive review of this issue of interior orientation
   parameter variation over time, it explains the common ways used for
   coping with the issue, and describes the existing methods for performing
   stability analysis for a single camera. The paper then points out the
   lack of coverage of stability analysis for multi-camera systems,
   suggests a modification of the collinearity model to be used for the
   calibration of an entire photogrammetric system, and proposes three
   methods for system stability analysis. The proposed methods explore the
   impact of the changes in interior orientation and relative
   orientation/mounting parameters on the reconstruction process. Rather
   than relying on ground truth in real datasets to check the system
   calibration stability, the proposed methods are simulation-based.
   Experiment results are shown, where a multi-camera photogrammetric
   system was calibrated three times, and stability analysis was performed
   on the system calibration parameters from the three sessions. The
   proposed simulation-based methods provided results that were compatible
   with a real-data based approach for evaluating the impact of changes in

Abstract = {{Asphaltenes exhibit an amphiphlic behavior and tend to form colloidal
   i-mers, because of their chemical structure. The formation of colloidal
   aggregates can generate formation damage for the precipitation and/or
   deposition of asphaltenes, because of the degree of self-association,
   altering the wettability of rock surface and significantly affect crude
   oil viscosity and specific gravity. This study aims at introducing a
   novel model for describing, at the macroscopic level, the adsorption
   equilibria of self-associating molecules such as asphaltenes in solution
   onto solid surfaces based on the ``chemical theory{''}. The model
   describes the adsorption isotherms temperature-dependent using three
   parameters, namely, maximum amount adsorbed, constant of i-mer
   reactions, and Henry's law constant. Furthermore, a
   temperature-independent model of five parameters, based on the
   modifications of the constants of reaction and Henry's law using an
   Arrhenius-type equation was proposed for estimating the thermodynamics
   parameters, such as Delta G(ads)(o), Delta H-ads(o), and Delta S-ads(o)
   of the adsorption process. This model improves the understanding of
   interactions asphaltene-asphaltene and asphaltene-solid surface on the
   adsorption-equilibrium process. The theoretical predictions of isotherms
   were validated successfully by determining the root mean-square errors
   (RSM\%) between data obtained from published literature and values
   predicted for asphaltenes and surfaces with differing chemical natures.
   More than 40 experimental data taken from literature have been used for
   validating the solid-liquid equilibrium (SLE) model for describing the
   adsorption isotherm of asphaltenes from different origins on surfaces
   with different chemical nature, which shows the model robustness due to
   the complexity of the liquid phase adsorption for those complex
   molecules.}},

Pages = {{23-32}},
Month = {{AUG-SEP}},
Abstract = {{Snow avalanche runout estimates are core to risk assessment and
   mitigation for infrastructure development and transportation corridors
   in mountain regions. Two statistical models, the Runout Ratio model and
   the alpha-beta model, estimate the extreme runout position using the
   point where the slope of the avalanche path centerline first reduces to
   ten degrees (beta point). In North America, the beta point has
   traditionally been determined through a field survey of the avalanche
   path runout zone; however, as they become more accessible, digital
   elevation models (DEM) are increasingly being used to determine beta as
   part of a preliminary review. While DEM requirements have been
   identified in avalanche literature, more focus is required on reviewing
   field error and relating the two methods.
   We surveyed 53 paths in western Canada, and estimated a field error
   distribution for the beta point with an interquartile range of +/- 2\%
   of path length and a maximum range of +/- 6.5\% of path length. Five
   DEMs were sourced with spatial resolutions ranging from 1 m to 90 m. Of
   these, a 10 m DEM generated the most similar beta point estimates to the
   field survey. 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel image registration method, called ensemble image
   registration, is proposed. We use an infinite Gaussian mixture model
   (IGMM), which is based on a joint Gaussian mixture model and a Dirichlet
   process (DP), to model the joint intensity scatter plot (JISP) of the
   unregistered images. The DP is the cornerstone of nonparametric Bayesian
   statistics, and has capability of determining a proper number of mixing
   components. To simultaneously register a group of images, the cost
   function of reducing the dispersion in the JISP is preformed by a
   Bayesian method using IGMM. A variational Bayesian framework is
   developed to inference the posterior distribution of the parameters in
   the IGMM. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method,
   experiments of ensemble image registration are presented. The results
   show that the proposed method has improved performance compared with
   conventional methods.}},

Abstract = {{The elastic response of the knee joint in various loading and
   pathological conditions has been investigated using anatomically
   accurate geometry. However, it is still challenging to predict the
   poromechanical response of the knee in realistic loading conditions. In
   the present study, a viscoelastic, poromechanical model of the knee
   joint was developed for soft tissues undergoing large deformation.
   Cartilages and menisci were modeled as fibril-reinforced porous
   materials and ligaments were considered as fibril-reinforced
   hyperelastic solids. Quasi-linear viscoelasticty was formulated for the
   collagen network of these tissues and nearly incompressible Neo-Hookean
   hyperelasticity was used for the non-fibrillar matrix. The constitutive
   model was coded with a user defined FORTRAN subroutine, in order to use
   ABAQUS for the finite element analysis. Creep and stress relaxation were
   investigated with large compression of the knee in full extension. The
   contact pressure distributions were found similar in creep and stress
   relaxation. However, the load transfer in the joint was completely
   different in these two loading scenarios. During creep, the contact
   pressure between cartilages decreased but the pressure between cartilage
   and meniscus increased with time. This led to a gradual transfer of some
   loading from the central part of cartilages to menisci. During stress
   relaxation, however, both contact pressures decreased monotonically. (C)

Journal = {{SYNTHETIC METALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{194}},
Pages = {{109-117}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Polyaniline (PANi)-coated multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and
   uncoated MWCNTs were added to a polystyrene (PS) matrix using solution
   and melt mixing. Electrical and rheological measurements were carried
   out on polymer composites to study the mechanism of conductive network
   formation. This work reveals the effect of nanofiller's coating on
   network formation using both rheological and electrical techniques.
   PANi-coated MWCNTs exhibit a much lower electrical percolation threshold
   (0.4 wt\%) than uncoated MWCNTs (0.7 wt\%), due to better dispersion of
   PANi-coated MWCNTs in a PS matrix. Dispersion of nanofillers in a
   polymer matrix was studied using optical microscopy and differential
   scanning calorimetry (DSC). Rheological characterizations of composite
   samples revealed a percolation behavior at higher concentration than
   that found electrical percolation. The inverse of damping factor
   (G'/G{''}) was the best parameter to elucidate the percolation threshold
   in a polymeric composite (i.e. PANi-coated MWCNT in PS had electrical
   percolation of 0.40 wt\% and rheological percolation 0.52 wt\%). A
   better affinity of PANi with PS led to better dispersion of nanofillers
   and lower rheological percolation for PS/MWCNT-PANi composites than
   those seen for PS/MWCNT composites. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{With regard to incorporation of the time factor, site layout models are
   traditionally grouped into two categories of static models (with no
   considerations of the changes overtime), and dynamic models (reflecting
   the changes on the construction sites). This paper demonstrates that
   there are in fact fundamental differences in the assumptions and the
   final outcome of models that are currently all categorized under dynamic
   site layout planning models, and proposes that these should in fact be
   divided into two groups of phased and dynamic models. The paper provides
   a comparative analysis of the three approaches of static, phased and
   dynamic site layout planning. The strengths, limitations, and
   differences in the final results of the three approaches are
   demonstrated through numerical examples. Finally, existing methods for
   the 2D representation of dynamic site layouts are compared, and an
   improved algorithm is provided to represent dynamic site layouts in

   with design surface for freeform surface inspection}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{53}},
Pages = {{90-103}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Inspection of a manufactured freeform surface can be conducted by
   sampling measurement points on the manufactured surface and comparing
   the measurement points with the ideal design geometry and its tolerance.
   Since the measurement coordinate system and design coordinate system are
   usually different, these measured points should be first aligned with
   the design surface through localization. In this research, robust
   localization methods are developed for both rough localization and fine
   localization processes. For rough localization, some target measurement
   points are selected and their corresponding points on the design surface
   are obtained based on similarities in curvatures and distances of these
   points. Compared with curvatures that are often used in localization,
   the distances are less sensitive to the errors introduced in
   manufacturing and measurement processes. In fine localization,
   uncertainties in the measurement and localization processes are
   considered to predict the uncertainties of the localized measurement
   points. The optimal design coordinate system is also selected such that
   the uncertainties of the localized measurement points can be minimized.
   Two case studies are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   developed methods for freeform surface inspection. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Miscible displacements in homogeneous porous media involving
   time-dependent injection velocities are analyzed. The displacements
   consist of periodic cycles that involve alternating stages of injection
   and production or of injection and soaking. Results of a linear
   stability analysis revealed that the growth rate of disturbances follows
   the overall trends of the velocity but with noticeable differences in
   periods of transition from production to injection. Furthermore, the
   growth rate of the time-dependent velocity was found to be smaller than
   that of a constant injection with a velocity equal to that corresponding
   to the minimum of while an overshoot was observed with respect to a
   displacement with a constant injection velocity equal to the maximum of
   . Nonlinear simulations revealed that the dynamics of the flow can be
   drastically changed from those of the corresponding constant injection
   velocity and the changes depend on the period of the cycles, the
   amplitude of the velocity and on whether the displacement is initiated
   through an injection or a soaking stage. The enhancement or attenuation
   of the instability in comparison with the constant injection velocity
   increases with the cycles' period and the amplitude of the velocity in
   the injection stage, with the effects of the former being more
   prominent. It was also found that, beyond a certain critical cycle

Journal = {{FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{124}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{To determine the intrinsic gasification rate from experiments performed
   in a thermogravimetric analyzer, the influences of mass transfer
   limitations must be evaluated. In this study, a system of nonlinear
   equations was numerically solved to quantify the mass transfer
   limitations in three mass transfer steps: external, interparticle, and
   intra-particle. Unlike previous studies in this area, the reaction was
   not assumed to be first order and the volume was not assumed to be
   constant. In this model, the apparent rates of CO2 gasification of
   petroleum coke and activated carbon, obtained from thermogravimetric
   analysis, were used to determine the effectiveness factors in each mass
   transfer step. The model was verified with isothermal experiments at
   1223 K and atmospheric pressure. The experimental results and the
   effectiveness factors calculated with the model showed that the initial
   mass and particle size were the main physical factors that influenced
   the gasification rate. The intrinsic reaction rate could only be
   obtained by thermogravimetric analysis if the effects of these factors
   on all mass transfer steps were determined. This model also demonstrated
   the importance of considering the volume change in the reaction of
   carbon with CO2 to evaluate the mass transfer steps. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Daily patterns of air pollutants are important to improve measurement
   retrievals and to model the regimes of local air quality. In this study,
   the daily patterns of SO2 and NO2 as well as their association with
   visibility and meteorological conditions in a suburban area of Xiamen
   are investigated. To achieve this goal, continuous field measurements
   were collected with a Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy
   (DOAS) system in 2011. The K-means clustering is used to classify the
   daily variation cycles of these measurements associated with different
   visibility and meteorological conditions such as temperature, relative
   humidity, wind speed and direction. The Davies-Bouldin index strategy is
   used to determine the optimal number of clusters. The regime of each
   cluster associated with visibility and meteorological conditions was
   then explored and compared. The comparative analyses show that both the
   maximum hourly average concentrations and the maximum daily average
   concentrations of SO2 and NO2 occurred in spring. Only 0.04 percent and
   3.19 percent of the days with SO2 and NO2, respectively, did not comply
   with the latest national ambient air quality standards of China (GB
   3095-2012). Moreover, the clustering results highlighted three
   representative patterns of daily SO2 concentrations and four
   representative patterns of daily NO2 concentrations. Both similarities
   and differences were presented among these clusters. The consistent
   changes in aerosol concentration with the changes in the measurements of
   NO2 and SO2 in each cluster provided supplemental evidence for the
   presence of the daily patterns of SO2 and NO2.}},

Abstract = {{Graphite intercalation compounds (GIC) have received global attention in
   the last decade because of the growing number of applications of these
   materials. Conventionally, bisulfate intercalated graphite is
   synthesized by chemical intercalation; which requires concentrated
   sulfuric acid (98\%) and an oxidizing agent such as H2O2 and HNO3. In
   this study, bisulfate intercalated graphite was prepared by
   electrochemical intercalation using dilute sulfuric acid with the aim to
   reduce the sulfur content in the final product. The electrochemical
   intercalation method required sulfuric acid with half of the
   concentration of that required for chemical intercalation, and without
   the need for an oxidizing agent. Chinese natural large flake graphite
   was used as the raw material for the electrochemical process. The GIC
   was characterized by the exfoliation volume obtained by thermal shock at
   a temperature of 850 degrees C. The effect of sulfuric acid
   concentration, electrochemical treatment time, particle size and
   temperature on the exfoliation volume was investigated. It was found
   that the exfoliation volume of the GIC-bisulfate, which is a function of
   degree of intercalation, can be controlled using the sulfuric acid
   concentration and treatment time. A sulfuric acid concentration of 50\%
   and an electrochemical treatment time of 60 min were found to produce a
   GIC with the maximum exfoliation volume for the range of conditions
   studied. (C) 2013 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering

Abstract = {{The flake GIC material delivered a small adsorptive capacity for a
   number of organic pollutants, however, underwent quick adsorption and
   electrochemical regeneration in minutes. In this study, binary and
   ternary GIC-based adsorbents were prepared using electrochemical
   intercalation of Chinese large flake graphite (CLFG) and Madagascan
   medium flake graphite (MMFG) materials. In this context GIC-bisulphate,
   GIC-nitrate, GIC-bisulphate-acetate, GIC nitrate-bisulphate, and
   GIC-nitrate-acetate were developed and characterized in order to
   evaluate their adsorptive and electrical properties. The adsorption
   behaviour was studied using an organic dye, acid violet 17, as a model
   dissolved organic pollutant. The treatment time and acid concentration
   for electrochemical intercalation were optimized in order to maximize
   the adsorptive capacity of the GIC based adsorbents. GIC-bisulphate
   delivered double adsorptive capacity after electrochemical
   intercalation, whereas, GIC nitrate diminished the adsorptive capacity
   to one half that of GIC bisulphate. However, no significant effect of
   ternary intercalated compounds was observed in terms of improved
   adsorption capacity or electrical conductivity. (C) 2013 The Korean

Abstract = {{We have applied both the master equation method and harmonic transition
   state theory to interpret the velocity-dependent friction behavior
   observed in atomic friction experiments. To understand the discrepancy
   between attempt frequencies measured in atomic force microscopy
   experiments and those estimated by theoretical models, both thermal
   noise and instrumental noise are introduced into the model. It is found
   that the experimentally observed low attempt frequency and the
   transition point at low velocity regimes can be interpreted in terms of
   the instrumental noise inherent in atomic force microscopy. In contrast
   to previous models, this model also predicts (1) the existence of a
   two-slope curve of velocity dependence and (2) the decrease of critical
   velocity with temperature, which provides clues for further experimental
   verification of the influence of instrumental noise in friction

Journal = {{NEUROCOMPUTING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Pages = {{300-314}},
Month = {{JUL 20}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a solution to the problem of weight drift, and
   associated bursting phenomenon, found in direct adaptive control.
   Bursting is especially likely to occur when systems are nonminimum phase
   or open-loop unstable. Standard methods in the literature, including
   leakage, e-modification, dead-zone, and weight projection, all trade off
   performance to prevent bursting. The solution presented here uses a
   novel introspective algorithm operating within a Cerebellar Model
   Arithmetic Computer (CMAC) neural network framework. The introspective
   algorithm determines an estimate of the derivative of error with respect
   to each weight in the CMAC. The local nature of the CMAC cell domains
   enables this technique, since this derivative can be calculated at the
   moment a cell is deactivated - based on the error within the cell's
   domain. If the derivative looks significant, the resulting weight change
   (due to a Lyapunov-stable adaptive update law) remains in the cell's
   memory. An insignificant derivative results in the weight change being
   discarded before the cell's next activation. The algorithm can prevent
   bursting without sacrificing performance, verified through an experiment
   with a (nonminimum phase) flexible-joint robot and a simulation of an
   (open-loop unstable) quadrotor helicopter. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In this work, two identical sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) with mature
   aerobic granules were utilized to treat synthetic high-strength ammonium
   wastewaters with chemical oxygen demand (COD)/total nitrogen (TN) ratios
   of 3.9-6.9. The contributions of various mechanisms to the removal of
   ammonium were determined. Ammonium levels of 600-2000mg-Nl(-1) had
   little adverse effect on the COD removal rate (91.6\%-95.3\%) with an
   influent COD of 4490-9860mgl(-1). The TN removal rate was slightly
   reduced from 71.3\% to 59.6\% as the influent ammonium concentration was
   increased from 600 to 2000mg-Nl(-1). Experimental results indicated that
   aerobic granules removed 94.5\% of COD and 59.6\% of TN in the treatment
   of synthetic high-strength wastewater (9860mg-CODl(-1) and 2000mg
   -Nl(-1)) during a 12h cycle. Granular adsorption, air stripping and
   conversion by nitrification/denitrification were responsible for
   removing 9\%, 15\% and 76\%, respectively, of the total removed -N.
   Dissolved oxygen (DO) was a useful process indicator of the biological
   reactions in the treatment of high-level ammonium wastewaters.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional haemodynamic analysis of pressure and flow in the pulmonary
   circulation yields incident and reflected waves throughout the cardiac
   cycle, even during diastole. The reservoir-wave model provides an
   alternative haemodynamic analysis consistent with minimal wave activity
   during diastole. Pressure and flow in the main pulmonary artery were
   measured in anaesthetized dogs and the effects of hypoxia and nitric
   oxide, volume loading and positive end-expiratory pressure were
   observed. The reservoir-wave model was used to determine the reservoir
   contribution to pressure and flow and once subtracted, resulted in
   `excess' quantities, which were treated as wave-related. Wave intensity
   analysis quantified the contributions of waves originating upstream
   (forward-going waves) and downstream (backward-going waves). In the
   pulmonary artery, negative reflections of incident waves created by the
   right ventricle were observed. Overall, the distance from the pulmonary

   cm. During 100\% O-2 ventilation, the strength of these reflections

Abstract = {{Steam gasification experiments of ash-free coal with and without
   potassium carbonate were performed in a newly designed drop-down
   reactor. The temperature dependency on the carbon conversion and gas
   production rates was investigated in a range of 600-800 degrees C and
   2.5 bar. The gasification rate at 700 degrees C was approximately 20
   times faster in the presence of the potassium catalysts. The
   gasification temperature could be lowered by similar to 125 degrees C.
   For example, at 625 degrees C the catalyzed gasification rate was
   essentially the same as for uncatalyzed rate at 750 degrees C. In
   addition, the catalyst reduced the apparent activation energy from 268
   to 161 kJ mol(-1). The water-gas-shift reaction was in equilibrium for
   both the uncatalyzed and catalyzed gasification of the ash-free coal
   samples. At low temperatures, a considerable amount of methane was
   formed through direct hydrogenation of the carbon substrate. Methane
   formation was decoupled from the COx production. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The major objectives of this study are investigating the influences of
   fracture inclination on oil recovery by steam injection processes. The
   strongest recovery mechanism in steam injection is reduction of
   viscosity ratio. In this article, steam heating of a naturally fractured
   reservoir is modeled in terms of a block with a single fracture
   surrounded by steam. An analytical approach is used, which considers the
   transient temperature distribution within a single block. A heat
   integral method is used to obtain the unsteady-state temperature
   profile. The temperature distribution is used to calculate drainage rate
   under gravity flow. The solutions obtained are used to determine the
   effect of fracture inclination and some other parameters on the oil rate
   in steam injection. The results indicated that a single horizontal
   fracture in the direction of oil flow (zero inclination angle) recovered
   the highest oil, while a similar formation with a single vertical
   fracture perpendicular to oil flow direction (90 degrees inclination
   angle) produced the lowest oil rate in steam heating. The increases of
   fracture inclination angle decreases oil recovery during steam heating.
   In addition, the recovery of oil for matrix with a single horizontal
   fracture is less dependent on average steam temperature, and this
   dependency becomes more as fracture inclination approaches to 90 degrees
   (matrix with vertical fracture).}},

Abstract = {{In oil sands mining extraction, water is an essential component;
   however, the processed water becomes contaminated through contact with
   the bitumen at high temperature, and a portion of it cannot be recycled
   and ends up in tailing ponds. The removal of naphthenic acids (NAs) from
   tailing pond water is crucial, as they are corrosive and toxic and
   provide a substrate for microbial activity that can give rise to
   methane, which is a potent greenhouse gas. In this study, the conversion
   of sawdust into an activated carbon (AC) that could be used to remove
   NAs from tailings water was studied. After producing biochar from
   sawdust by a slow-pyrolysis process, the biochar was physically
   activated using carbon dioxide (CO2) over a range of temperatures or
   prior to producing biochar, and the sawdust was chemically activated
   using phosphoric acid (H3PO4). The physically activated carbon had a
   lower surface area per gram than the chemically activated carbon. The
   physically produced ACs had a lower surface area per gram than
   chemically produced AC. In the adsorption tests with NAs, up to 35mg of
   NAs was removed from the water per gram of AC. The chemically treated
   ACs showed better uptake, which can be attributed to its higher surface
   area and increased mesopore size when compared with the physically
   treated AC. Both the chemically produced and physically produced AC
   provided better uptake than the commercially AC.}},

Pages = {{1630-1638}},

Abstract = {{The use of coagulation and Fenton oxidation was studied for total
   organic carbon (TOC) and silica removal from steam-assisted gravity
   drainage (SAGD) water at 80 degrees C and two different concentrations
   replicating the stream feeding the warm lime softening unit having
   675mg/L TOC and 350mg/L silica and the blowdown of the once through
   steam generator having 3700mg/L TOC and 2585mg/L silica. Coagulation was
   carried out by the addition of FeCl3, Al(NO3)(3) or Ca(NO3)(2). The
   results showed that Fe(III) salt outperformed Al(III) and Ca(II) salts.
   A two-stage addition of 2.5g FeCl3 per g TOC intermediated by a
   filtration unit resulted in approximately 72\% TOC removal and more than
   80\% silica removal while maintaining low solid waste. Comparing results
   pertaining to coagulant concentration and final pH, it can be easily
   concluded that silica removal is governed by the resultant pH, whereas
   TOC removal was accomplished through surface neutralization and
   localized enmeshment coagulation. Fenton oxidation is proposed to
   further treat the filtrate obtained from the second stage Fe(III)
   coagulation. An additional 10\% TOC removal could be achieved; at seven
   times lower H2O2 dose in the presence of Fe (2+) or Fe-0 reagent.
   Moreover, the advanced Fenton process resulted in high silica removal as
   a result of adsorption onto Fe(OH)(3) precipitate, which formed at the
   equilibrium pH of the system.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple sclerosis (MS) impairs brain activity through demyelination and
   loss of axons. Increased brain activity is accompanied by increases in
   microvascular hemoglobin oxygen saturation (oxygenation) and total
   hemoglobin, which can be measured using functional near-infrared
   spectroscopy (fNIRS). Due to the potentially reduced size and integrity
   of the white matter tracts within the corpus callosum, it may be
   expected that MS patients have reduced functional communication between
   the left and right sides of the brain; this could potentially be an
   indicator of disease progression. To assess interhemispheric
   communication in MS, we used fNIRS during a unilateral motor task and
   the resting state. The magnitude of the change in hemoglobin parameters
   in the motor cortex was significantly reduced in MS patients during the
   motor task relative to healthy control subjects. There was also a
   significant decrease in interhemispheric communication between the motor
   cortices (expressed as coherence) in MS patients compared to controls
   during the motor task, but not during the resting state. fNIRS
   assessment of interhemispheric coherence during task execution may be a
   useful marker in disorders with white matter damage or axonal loss,

Abstract = {{Objective: To develop a microsimulation model of thoracic surgery
   workforce supply and demand to forecast future labor requirements.
   Methods: The Canadian Community Health Survey and Canadian Census data
   were used to develop a microsimulation model. The demand component
   simulated the incidence of lung cancer; the supply component simulated
   the number of practicing thoracic surgeons. The full model predicted the
   rate of operable lung cancers per surgeon according to varying numbers
   of graduates per year.
   Results: From 2011 to 2030, the Canadian national population will
   increase by 10 million. The lung cancer incidence rates will increase
   until 2030, then plateau and decline. The rate will vary by region
   (12.5\% in Western Canada, 37.2\% in Eastern Canada) and will be less
   pronounced in major cities (10.3\%). Minor fluctuations in the yearly
   thoracic surgery graduation rates (range, 4-8) will dramatically affect
   the future number of practicing surgeons (range, 116-215). The rate of
   operable lung cancer varies from 35.0 to 64.9 cases per surgeon
   annually. Training 8 surgeons annually would maintain the current rate
   of operable lung cancer cases per surgeon per year (range, 32-36).
   However, this increased rate of training will outpace the lung cancer
   incidence after 2030.
   Conclusions: At the current rate of training, the incidence of operable
   lung cancer will increase until 2030 and then plateau and decline. The
   increase will outstrip the supply of thoracic surgeons, but the decline
   after 2030 will translate into an excess future supply. Minor increases
   in the rate of training in response to short-term needs could be
   problematic in the longer term. Unregulated workforce changes should,
   therefore, be approached with care.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Pedicle screw insertion, to stabilize or correct the spine,
   relies on creating a probe path with the correct trajectory to prevent
   unsafe breaching of the cortical wall. Safe pedicle cannulation is aided
   when the surgeon can feel the difference between a safe and unsafe path.
   Pedicle probe forces and torques are currently unknown. The purpose of
   this study was to investigate the forces and torques encountered while
   cannulating the pedicle tract in both correct and incorrect
   cannulations.
   Methods: Two experienced surgeons used a standard lumbar probe modified
   to incorporate a 6 degree-of-freedom load cell to cannulate and breach
   the T12 to S1 vertebrae of six fresh frozen cadavers (3 males, 3
   females, ages 65 to 92). A total of 76 pedicles were tested.
   Findings: Cannulation axial forces averaged 48 N (standard deviation =
   13 N), medial breach 129 N (standard deviation = 25 N), and lateral
   breach 86 N (standard deviation = 27 N). Cannulation values were
   significantly lower than the breach values in all 6 degrees of freedom
   (p < 0.001). There were significant differences between specimens,
   including males and females, and between degrees of freedom, but no
   significant right and left differences or by vertebral level.
   Conclusion: A large range of cannulation and breach forces and torques
   were measured due to variations in bone quality and geometry, as
   experienced clinically. This is the first time that the absolute and
   relative force and torque levels have been reported, to our knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{A multiplier-less architecture based on algebraic integer representation
   for computing the Daubechies 6-tap wavelet transform for 1-D/ 2-D signal
   processing is proposed. This architecture improves on previous designs
   in a sense that it minimizes the number of parallel 2-input adder
   circuits. The algorithm was achieved using brute-force numerical
   optimization of the algebraic integer representation. The proposed
   architecture furnishes exact computation up to the final reconstruction
   step, which is the operation that maps the exactly computed filtered
   results from algebraic integer representation to fixed-point. Compared
   to our recent work, this architecture shows a reduction of 27 . n - 16
   adder circuits, where n is the number of wavelet decomposition levels.
   The design is physically implemented for a 4-level 1-D/ 2-D
   decomposition using a Xilinx Virtex-6 vcx240t-1ff1156 field programmable
   gate array (FPGA) device operating at up to a maximum clock frequency of
   344/ 168 MHz. The FPGA implementation of 1-D/ 2-D are tested using
   hardware co-simulation using an ML605 board with clock of 100 MHz. A 45

Abstract = {{C-arm fluoroscopy is frequently used in clinical applications as a
   low-cost and mobile real-time qualitative assessment tool. C-arms,
   however, are not widely accepted for applications involving quantitative
   assessments, mainly due to the lack of reliable and low-cost position
   tracking methods, as well as adequate calibration and registration
   techniques. The solution suggested in this work is a tracked C-arm
   (TC-arm) which employs a low-cost sensor tracking module that can be
   retrofitted to any conventional C-arm for tracking the individual joints
   of the device.
   Registration and offline calibration methods were developed that allow
   accurate tracking of the gantry and determination of the exact intrinsic
   and extrinsic parameters of the imaging system for any acquired
   fluoroscopic image. The performance of the system was evaluated in
   comparison to an Optotrak motion tracking system and by a series of
   experiments on accurately built ball-bearing phantoms. Accuracies of the
   system were determined for 2D-3D registration, three-dimensional
   landmark localization, and for generating panoramic stitched views in
   simulated intraoperative applications.
   The system was able to track the center point of the gantry with an
   accuracy of mm or better. Accuracies of 2D-3D registrations were mm and
   . Three-dimensional landmark localization had an accuracy of of the
   length (or mm) on average, depending on whether the landmarks were
   located along, above, or across the table. The overall accuracies of the
   two-dimensional measurements conducted on stitched panoramic images of
   the femur and lumbar spine were 2.5 2.0 \% and , respectively.
   The TC-arm system has the potential to achieve sophisticated
   quantitative fluoroscopy assessment capabilities using an existing C-arm
   imaging system. This technology may be useful to improve the quality of
   orthopedic surgery and interventional radiology.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional building models are important for various
   applications, such as disaster management and urban planning. The
   development of laser scanning sensor technologies has resulted in many
   different approaches for efficient building model generation using LiDAR
   data. Despite this effort, generation of these models lacks economical
   and reliable techniques that fully exploit the advantage of LiDAR data.
   Therefore, this research aims to develop a framework for fully-automated
   building model generation by integrating data-driven and model-driven
   methods using LiDAR datasets.
   The building model generation starts by employing LiDAR data for
   building detection and approximate boundary determination. The generated
   building boundaries are then integrated into a model-based processing
   strategy because LiDAR derived planes show irregular boundaries due to
   the nature of LiDAR point acquisition. The focus of the research is
   generating models for the buildings with right-angled-corners, which can
   be described with a collection of rectangles under the assumption that
   the majority of the buildings in urban areas belong to this category.
   Therefore, by applying the Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR) algorithm
   recursively, the LiDAR boundaries are decomposed into sets of rectangles
   for further processing. At the same time, the quality of the MBRs is
   examined to verify that the buildings, from which the boundaries are
   generated, are buildings with right-angled-corners. The parameters that
   define the model primitives are adjusted through a model-based boundary
   fitting procedure using LiDAR boundaries. The level of details in the
   final Digital Building Model is based on the number of recursions during
   the MBR processing, which in turn are determined by the LiDAR point
   density. The model-based boundary fitting improves the quality of the
   generated boundaries and as seen in experimental results, the quality
   depends on the average LiDAR point spacing. This research thus develops
   an approach which not only automates the building model generation, but
   also achieves the best accuracy of the model while utilizing only LiDAR
   data. (C) 2013 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote

   collected in urban areas. This paper introduces a new approach for the
   identification, parameterization, and segmentation of these features
   from laser scanning data while considering the internal characteristics
   of the utilized point cloud - i.e., local point density variation and
   noise level in the dataset. In the first step of this approach, a
   Principal Component Analysis of the local neighborhood of individual
   points is implemented to identify the points that belong to planar and
   linear/cylindrical features and select their appropriate representation
   model. For the detected planar features, the segmentation attributes are
   then computed through an adaptive cylinder neighborhood definition. Two
   clustering approaches are then introduced to segment and extract
   individual planar features in the reconstructed parameter domain. For
   the linear/cylindrical features, their directional and positional
   parameters are utilized as the segmentation attributes. A sequential
   clustering technique is proposed to isolate the points which belong to
   individual linear/cylindrical features through directional and
   positional attribute subspaces. Experimental results from simulated and
   real datasets demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach for
   the extraction of planar and linear/cylindrical features from laser
   scanning data. (C) 2013 International Society for Photogrammetry and

Abstract = {{Oedometer tests were conducted on dry and saturated kaolinite clay
   samples to investigate the effects of stress level, stress history, pore
   fluid type, and drainage path on time-dependent deformation under
   one-dimensional (1D) constant stress. Different deformation modes
   involved in the creep compression were identified and quantified: creep
   deformation of individual particles and creep shear displacement at
   particle contacts. It was found that the creep compression is a coupled
   process involving the above creep deformations and induced viscous flow
   resulting in pore compression. The rate of 1D creep compression is
   controlled by the drainage path along which the viscous flow occurs. It
   was also observed that mechanically induced consolidation has an
   accelerating effect on the creep compression of the test samples
   existing within the limit time zone. This observation confirms that 1D
   creep compression is a continuation of 1D consolidation in which the
   largest existing interaggregate pores collapse under a given effective
   stress. No creep compression was observed when the test samples were
   mechanically overconsolidated to a state beyond the limit time zone
   because the interaggregates were compressed to a stable structure.

Abstract = {{Ordinary drillstring torsional vibration is a very common phenomenon
   that has been attracted great interesting. Through Measurement data, a
   series of studies and analysis of torsional vibration characteristics of
   the bottom hole assembly (BHA) have been developed. However, for rotary
   steerable system (RSS), especially push-the-bit mode, its drill
   torsional vibration phenomenon will demonstrate the new properties,
   because that the underground implementing agencies will generate cycle
   torque and drag to the BHA in the orientation process. This process is
   completely different to the previous. A set of ``strap-down{''}
   measurement system was developed in this paper, and the triaxial
   accelerometer and triaxial fluxgate were installed near the bit.
   Proposed a method of solver drill bit rotation speed using real-time
   downhole measurement data (sampling frequency 100 Hz), and the torsional
   vibration mathematical model of push-the-bit RSS was established. We
   found that the torsional vibration phenomenon of push-the-bit RSS is
   more serious than the ordinary drilling system by downhole measurement
   data analysis, even in most cases manifested as stick-slip. The
   torsional vibration was divided into five different modes, which showing
   different statistical regularities. Corresponding analysis of the
   angular displacement and speed, we found that the drill bit always
   appears low-speed in the position of oriented. This is a strong proof of
   that the RSS implementing agencies pushing the BHA caused the drill bit
   torsional vibration more serious. This work is supplemented and
   development of the drill string torsional vibration studies. Contribute
   to the better understanding of the dynamics of the push-the-bit RSS. Put
   forward a new way of analysis the rotary steerable drillstring fatigue
   damage predicted, steering ability and the torsional vibration control.}},

Abstract = {{Metal nanowire/polyaniline core-shell nanoparticles have significant
   potential for the development of materials for electrostatical
   dissipation, electromagnetic interference shields, chemical and
   biological sensors, charge and hydrogen storage. In this study, the
   synthesis of novel core-shell nanostructures of polyaniline-coated
   copper nanowires (PANI/CuNWs) is presented. CuNWs of 25nm in diameter
   and several microns in length were synthesised using hard template
   method and were subsequently coated with doped or undoped polyanilines
   to obtain high aspect ratio core-shell nanoparticles. SEM, TEM, XPS and
   electrical conductivity measurements were used to characterise these
   novel nanomaterials. TEM characterisation showed a smooth polyaniline
   nanocoating of about 6nm in thickness over the CuNW surface. The
   thickness of the coating can be controlled by changing PANI
   concentration in the solution. XPS results indicate that spontaneous
   adsorption of polyaniline results from the strong surficial interaction
   between copper atoms at the nanowire surface and imine groups in the

Abstract = {{Multipath propagation can cause significant impairments to the
   performance of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers and
   is often the dominant source of accuracy degradation for high precision
   GNSS applications. Commonly used time-of-arrival estimation techniques
   cannot provide the required estimation accuracy in severely dense
   multipath environments such as urban canyons. Multipath components are
   highly correlated and this results in a rank deficiency of the signal
   autocorrelation matrix. In this paper the Doppler spectrum broadening of
   the fast fading channel resulting from the motion of the receiver or
   surrounding objects is employed to decorrelate signal reflections for
   the purpose of high-resolution estimation of multipath delays through
   the subspace-based Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) technique.
   Specifically, delay-domain correlator outputs at different Doppler
   frequencies are combined to enhance the rank of the signal
   autocorrelation matrix. Simulation and results of real data collected in
   an urban environment (downtown Calgary) are presented to compare the
   performance of the proposed method with the
   spatial-temporal-diversity-based MUSIC technique and a widely available
   algorithm in commercial GNSS receivers, namely the double-delta
   correlator technique. The performance metrics are based upon pseudorange
   and positioning errors, which are derived using an accurate reference
   trajectory established using a high precision GNSS-INS integrated
   system.}},

Abstract = {{The viscosity of microbubbles has been measured in capillary tubes.
   Experiments were conducted in tubes of different diameters and lengths,
   with a constant microbubble concentration. The effects of bubble void
   fraction and size distribution on the viscosity of microbubbles were
   also investigated. Microbubbles demonstrate shear-thinning non-Newtonian
   behavior. The viscosity of microbubbles decreases with a decrease in
   tube diameter and bubble void fraction, and with an increase in tube
   length. Although viscosity changes with tube dimensions, the flow index
   (n) is only influenced by the microbubble void fraction. It is also
   found that bubble size distribution in the range (1-12 mu m) used in
   this study does not affect the viscosity of microbubbles. The data were
   then used to develop a correlation to predict viscosity of microbubbles,

Abstract = {{A novel approach with fewer technical and analytic limitations in liquid
   solvent-bitumen diffusion studies is used in this article. The Taylor
   dispersion technique was selected for its convenient short run time
   experiments and reliable data analysis to find mutual diffusion
   coefficients in a hexane+bitumen mixture. For the first time, the
   infinite-dilution molecular diffusion coefficients of bitumen in hexane
   were measured in both the presence and relative absence of asphaltene
   particles in the solution at atmospheric pressure and temperatures of
   303.15, 310.15, and 317.15 K. The polydisperse nature of bitumen was
   clearly revealed. Results were compared with common predictive tools.
   Also, the asphaltene surface charge in the hexane precipitating solvent
   was demonstrated. Through concentration dependency investigations at
   atmospheric pressure and 303.15 K, it was determined that the mutual
   diffusion coefficients monotonically decrease as the viscosity of
   mixture increases within the studied 0-34\% volumetric concentration of
   bitumen. The Taylor dispersion technique shows great potential for
   diffusion studies of liquid solvent-bitumen systems. (c) 2014 American

Abstract = {{Cardiac propagation characteristics such as anisotropy ratio and
   conduction velocities are often determined experimentally from
   epicardial measurements. We hypothesize that these measurements have
   inaccuracies due to intramural fiber rotation and transmural
   electrotonic interactions. We also hypothesize that optical mapping (OM)
   recordings compound the error, due to contributions from deeper layers.
   In this study, we studied propagation in a three-dimensional computer
   model of a slab of tissue with varying thickness and a 120 degrees fiber
   rotation. Simulation results were further processed to reconstruct OM
   signals. As expected, simulation results demonstrated that the direction
   of wave propagation on the epicardial surface is not aligned with the
   epicardial fiber orientation. This angle difference was most pronounced
   for thin tissue, and decreased with decreasing intramural conductivity
   and increasing tissue thickness. This difference also increased with
   time elapsed poststimulus, as the contribution from deeper layers
   increased. Observations were confirmed experimentally with OM
   measurements from isolated rat hearts. Simulations also predicted that
   OM causes an additional error in measurements due to activity in deeper
   layers being less aligned. Several alternative approaches for the
   estimation of fiber orientation and anisotropy ratio were evaluated.
   Those based on conduction velocity measurements yielded the most
   accurate estimates when applied to noise-free simulated data.}},

Volume = {{39}},
Pages = {{358-365}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The study examines the strategies that people use to secure their
   interests in land in a pen-urban Accra customary community. In a
   contested chieftaincy, customary leaders sell agricultural and virgin
   land to strangers for residential purposes, causing conflict and
   altering traditional livelihoods, and the proceeds of the sales do not
   flow to members of the lineage group. Violence and murder, involving
   land guards hired to defend different land claims or to drive farmers
   off their land, have occurred. The case confirms theory describing the
   behavioural patterns to be expected during major social change typically
   found in pen-urban areas when government is unable or unwilling to
   enforce the law. The flexible, negotiable rules characteristic of
   customary systems can be manipulated by individuals seeking power and
   control over land. Accepting that customary land administration is here
   to stay, the case supports the view that the customary system needs
   major reform to incorporate local-level checks and balances on land
   administration to make customary leaders accountable as fiduciaries. In
   terms of registration usage theory customary landholders in the study
   area saw title deeds as marginally useful in their agricultural lands
   but not in family compounds, whereas for strangers registration is
   essential. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Characteristics and impact of meteorological variables}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},

Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{110-117}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Knowledge of vertical CO2 distribution is important for development of
   CO2 transport models and calibration/validation of satellite-borne
   measurements. In this study, vertical profiles of CO2 concentration
   within 0-1000 m were measured using a tethered balloon at a suburban
   site in Xiamen, which is undergoing fast urbanization. The
   characteristics of CO2 vertical distribution were investigated under
   both stable and convective boundary-layer conditions. The correlation of
   ground level CO2 concentrations and those at high altitudes decreased
   with altitude and show significant correlation in the first 300 m with R
   = 0.78 at 100 m, R = 0.52 at 200 m, R = 0.40 at 300 m (P < 0.01). The
   correlation keeps almost constant for 300-800 m, and there is no obvious
   correlation at 800 m, indicating that the impact of ground level CO2 was
   restricted within the 300 m above the ground. When comparing the
   vertical profiles obtained at different times during a 24 h period, it
   was found that CO2 concentration exhibited more obvious diurnal pattern
   at surface level than at high altitude because of the variation of
   sources and sinks of CO2 at ground level. Most profiles demonstrated
   declining trends of CO2 concentration with increasing altitude. The
   vertical profiles of CO2 were fitted to obtain an empirical equation for
   estimating CO2 vertical concentration in the lower atmosphere (0-1000
   m): y = -75.04 + 1.17 x 10(9)e(-x/28.01), R-2 = 0.59 (P < 0.05).
   However, for some cases opposite patterns were observed that the CO2
   concentration profiles showed a turning point at a certain altitude or
   little variation with altitude under certain meteorological conditions.
   The atmospheric boundary layer depth and atmospheric stability are two
   major factors controlling the vertical structure of CO2 profile. The
   results would improve our understanding of the spatial and temporal
   variation of CO2 in urban environment, which would facilitate using 3-D
   transport model to study the impacts of CO2 on urban environment. (C)

Abstract = {{In the current study, we used an estrogen-deficient mouse model of
   osteoporosis to test the efficacy of a cell-generated bone tissue
   construct for bone augmentation of an impaired healing fracture. A
   reduction in new bone formation at the defect site was observed In
   ovariectomized fractures compared to the control group using repeated
   measures in vivo micro-computed tomography (ACT) imaging over 4 weeks. A
   significant increase in the bone mineral density (BMD), trabecular bone
   volume ratio, and trabecular number, thickness and connectivity were
   associated with fracture repair in the control group, whereas the
   fractured bones of the ovariectomized mice exhibited a loss in all of
   these parameters (p < 0.001). In a separate group, ovariectomized
   fractures were treated with murine embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived
   osteoblasts loaded in a three-dimensional collagen I gel and recovery of
   the bone at the defect site was observed. A significant increase in the
   trabecular bone volume ratio (p < 0.001) and trabecular number (p <
   0.01) was observed by 4 weeks in the fractures treated with cell-loaded
   collagen matrix compared to those treated with collagen I alone. The
   stem cell-derived osteoblasts were identified at the fracture site at 4
   weeks post-implantation through in situ hybridization histochemistry.
   Although this cell tracking method was effective, the formation of an
   ectopic cellular nodule adjacent to the knee joints of two mice
   suggested that alternative in vivo cell tracking methods should be
   employed in order to definitively assess migration of the implanted
   cells. To our knowledge, this study is the first of its kind to examine
   the efficacy of stem cell therapy for fracture repair in an
   osteoporosis-related fracture model in vivo. The findings presented
   provide novel insight into the use of stem cell therapies for bone
   injuries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   there really a maximum reaction rate?}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{124}},
Pages = {{73-81}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{A novel procedure to perform carbon dioxide (CO2) gasification studies
   was tested with two different Alberta coals and compared to the most
   common procedures using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The designed
   experiments indicate that maximum reaction rates reported in the
   literature were probably a consequence of the increasing CO2
   concentration in the gas mixture when the inert gas was switched to CO2.
   It has been proven that, independent of feedstocks, the time to observe
   this maximum reaction rate was constant, indicating the reported maximum
   reaction rate depends only on the gas dispersion when the gasifying
   agent is fed and not on the surface properties of the char.
   In addition, the comparison of different experimental procedures shows
   the time that the char was exposed to an inert gas atmosphere prior to
   gasification, decreased the reactivity of the char. The reason is a
   reduction of the char mesopore area, which was induced when pyrolysis
   and gasification were separated with an isothermal step using an inert
   gas. The random pore model is the most common model used to describe
   coal and biomass gasification in the literature, since it can predict a
   maximum reaction rate for a determined conversion. However, its usage
   may be inappropriate for gasification kinetics analysis, if the changing
   gas mixture effect and the char surface area reduction induced by the
   experimental procedure are not considered. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Oil spills on fresh water can cause serious environmental and economic
   impacts onshore activities affecting those who exploit freshwater
   resources and grassland. Alumina nanoparticles functionalized with
   vacuum residue (VR) were used as a low-cost and high hydrophobic
   nanosorbents. The nanomaterial resulting showed high adsorption affinity
   and capacity of oil from oil-in-freshwater emulsion. The effects of the
   following variables on oil removal were investigated, namely: contact
   times, solution pH, initial oil concentrations, temperature, VR loadings
   and salinity. Kinetic studies showed that adsorption was fast and
   equilibrium was achieved in less than 30 min. The amount adsorbed of oil
   was higher for neutral system compared to acidic or basic medium.
   Increasing the VR loading on nanoparticle surface favored the
   adsorption. Results of this study showed that oil removal for all
   systems evaluated had better performance at pH value of 7 using
   nano-alumina functionalized with 4 wt\% VR. Adsorption equilibrium and
   kinetics were evaluated using the Polanyi theory-based Dubinin-Ashtakhov
   (DA) model, and pseudo-first and pseudo-second order-models,
   respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, four CO2 carriers were examined through 31
   carbonation-calcination cycles. The carriers included one natural
   limestone (Cadomin) and three modified calcium oxide-based sorbents,
   Cadomin-calcium aluminate cement pellets (CD-CA-14), Cadomin-silica-sol
   pellets (CD-Si), and Cadomin-mesostructured silica core/shell pellets
   (CD-CS). The modified sorbents were not only prepared using two
   different binders (calcium aluminate cement, CA-14, and silica-sol,
   HS-40), but the CD-CS sample was provided with a protective porous shell
   (using a mesoporous silica layer). Natural Cadomin limestone was the
   base common to the modified sorbents. The surface morphology and
   porosity of these sorbents before and after different cycles were
   investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and nitrogen
   physisorption (BET/BJH). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was also used to
   identify the crystal phase composition of the sorbents before and after
   calcination. The results showed that the presence of the Mayenite phase
   (Ca12Al14O33) in the CD-CA-14 pellets led to slower decay in sorbent
   activity with increased number of cycles. Although the CD-CS pellets
   showed the best performance in the retention of CO2 uptake activity over
   31 cycles, with an activity loss of only 46\%, the pellet shells
   experienced severe disintegration during the first few cycles. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The rapid industrial development and urbanization has lead to increasing
   particulate matter pollution in the Cross Taiwan Strait Region, which
   has significant impacts on atmospheric visibility degradation. Long-term
   visibility trends in five typical cities over the cross-strait region
   (i.e., Xiamen and Fuzhou in the Western Taiwan Strait (WTS) region and
   Taipei, Taichung and Tainan in Taiwan) and its correlation with air
   quality and meteorological conditions were investigated using visibility
   and meteorological data during 1973-2011 and air pollution data during
   2009-2011. For the entire period, the overall average visibilities in
   the WTS region were better than those in Taiwan, with an average of
   16.8, 16.6, 8.5, 10.3 and 9.0 km in Fuzhou, Xiamen, Taipei, Taichung and
   Tainan, respectively. Decline trends with decreasing rates of -0.5-0.1
   km/yr existed in all cities except Taipei, which had an improvement in
   visibility after 1992. All seasons had decreasing trends during the
   39-year period except in Taipei. The WTS region had the worse change
   trend compared with Taiwan. No statistically significant weekend effect
   in visibility is found over the region. Visibilities were better in
   summer and autumn, while worse in winter and spring. Correlation
   analysis revealed that significant negative correlations existed between
   visibility and NO2 and airborne particles (i.e., PM10 and PM2.5); PM2.5
   played an important role in visibility degradation. High temperature and
   low pressure is beneficial for better visibility. Principal component
   analysis further confirmed the impacts of high concentrations of air
   pollutants, stable synoptic systems and humid air with high relative
   humidity on visibility impairment In addition, case studies highlighted
   characteristics and potential causes of typical regional low visibility
   episodes over the region. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Link between endowments, economics and environment in conventional and
   unconventional gas reservoirs}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{126}},
Pages = {{224-238}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a methodology for connecting endowments, economics
   and the environment in conventional, tight, shale and Coalbed Methane
   (CBM) reservoirs. The volumetric estimates are generated by a Variable
   Shape Distribution model (VSD). The VSD has been shown in the past to be
   useful for the evaluation of conventional and tight gas reservoirs.
   However, this is the first paper in which the method is used to also
   include shale gas and CBM formations. Results indicate a total gas
   endowment of 70,000 tcf, split between 15,000 tcf in conventional
   reservoirs, 15,000 tcf in tight gas, 30,000 tcf in shale gas and 10,000
   tcf in CBM reservoirs. Thus, natural gas formations have potential to
   provide a significant contribution to global energy demand estimated at
   approximately 790 quads by 2035.
   A common thread between unconventional formations is that nearly all of
   them must be hydraulically fractured to attain commercial production. A
   significant volume of data indicates that the probabilities of hydraulic
   fracturing (fracking) fluids and/or methane contaminating ground water
   through the hydraulically-created fractures are very low. Since fracking
   has also raised questions about the economic viability of producing
   unconventional gas in some parts of the world, supply curves are
   estimated in this paper for the global gas portfolio. The curves show
   that, in some cases, the costs of producing gas from unconventional
   reservoirs are comparable to those of conventional gas.
   The conclusion is that there is enough natural gas to supply the energy
   market for nearly 400 years at current rates of consumption and 110
   years with a growth rate in production of 2\% per year. With appropriate
   regulation, this may be done safely, commercially, and in a manner that
   is more benign to the environment as compared with other fossil fuels.

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{112}},
Pages = {{72-78}},
Month = {{JUN 14}},
Abstract = {{The small size of microbubbles, along with their stability, has made
   them popular in many applications. Most of the applications involve the
   flow of microbubbles through capillary environments. In this study, the
   theological behavior of microbubbles has been examined using their flow
   index in capillary tubes, in Re < 50. The flow indexes of microbubbles
   have been calculated from the experimental pressure drop measured along
   the capillary tube. Microbubbles presented pseudoplastic behavior. Flow
   index was only influenced by bubble void fraction and did not show any
   dependency on the geometrical conditions of the tube. From the measured
   pressure drops along the capillary tubes, the Fanning friction factor
   has been calculated. It has been found that, in low Re numbers,
   Poiseuille's equation underestimates friction factor. In this work, for
   the first time,the non-Newtonian Re was employed to calculate the
   Fanning friction factor for microbubbles suspensions in capillary tube.
   A very good agreement between experimental data and the linear equation
   of friction factor with non-Newtonian Re has been observed. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{In the well-studied cryptographic primitive 1-out-of-N oblivious
   transfer, a user retrieves a single element from a database of size N
   without the database learning which element was retrieved. While it has
   previously been shown that a secure implementation of 1-out-of-N
   oblivious transfer is impossible against arbitrarily powerful
   adversaries, recent research has revealed an interesting class of
   private query protocols based on quantum mechanics in a cheat sensitive
   model. Specifically, a practical protocol does not need to guarantee
   that the database provider cannot learn what element was retrieved if
   doing so carries the risk of detection. The latter is sufficient
   motivation to keep a database provider honest. However, none of the
   previously proposed protocols could cope with noisy channels. Here we
   present a fault-tolerant private query protocol, in which the novel
   error correction procedure is integral to the security of the protocol.
   Furthermore, we present a proof-of-concept demonstration of the protocol
   over a deployed fibre.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with a fundamental assumption in the theory of
   plasticity: the direction of plastic strain increments is independent of
   the loading (stress) increment direction. This assumption, also known as
   plastic flow rule postulate, works quite well for metal-like materials.
   However, geomaterials such as sand present deformational mechanisms that
   are distinctive from those of metals when they are loaded. As such, we
   hereby examine the validity of this postulate for granular media
   accounting for their discrete nature. This is accomplished by analysing
   the mechanical behaviour of a cubic assembly of polydispersed spherical
   articles using a particle flow code. An extension to Gudehus' response
   envelope to three-dimensional conditions is used to study the
   incremental character and influence of loading direction on the
   behaviour of these materials. It is found that plastic flow in granular
   media is governed by both current state variables and incremental
   loading direction and magnitude, especially under non-axisymmetric
   stress conditions. The flow rule postulate of plasticity remains valid
   only in axisymmetric and biaxial conditions. We also verified that the
   plastic response might be significantly influenced by the stress path
   (or history) taken prior to loading. These findings raise the question
   of whether or not classic elastoplastic models based on the above
   postulate will have serious shortcomings, especially in true-triaxial
   conditions. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a successful investigation of polymer gel behavior
   from laboratory experiments to full field scale simulation. First, a
   series of laboratory experiments are conducted to achieve a deep
   understanding of polymer gel behavior. The results show that the polymer
   viscosity, gelation time, and gel strength strongly depend on the
   reservoir temperature, polymer type, polymer concentration, cross-linker
   concentration, pH, and salt concentration, which are the keys of a
   polymer conformance control process. According to the laboratory
   experiments, polymer gel flooding is applied for the White Tiger field,
   which is the biggest oil field in Viet Nam. The polymer gel treatment is
   simulated in the full field scale and the results indicate that it is an
   excellent candidate for conformance control. Water production decreases
   from 4,800 m(3)/d to slightly less than 2,000 m(3)/d, while a
   significant increase in oil production has been achieved from unswept
   zones, which is a really successful evidence of the polymer conformance
   control technology in heterogeneous reservoirs.}},

   time-bin qubit-based QKD system in a secure laboratory environment (i.e.
   in a setting in which eavesdropping can be excluded). The good agreement
   between the predictions and the experimental data allows the model to be
   used to optimize mean photon numbers per attenuated laser pulse, which
   are used to encode quantum bits. This in turn allows optimization of
   secret key rates of existing MDI-QKD systems, identification of
   rate-limiting components, and projection of future performance. In
   addition, we also performed measurements over deployed fiber, showing

Abstract = {{In recent years there has been an increasing interest in production of
   methane gas from hydrate-bearing sediments, located below the permafrost
   in arctic regions and offshore within the continental margins. In order
   to simulate the geomechanical response of the hydrate accumulation
   during gas production, comprehensive evaluation of the sediments'
   properties is imperative. This paper presents an analysis of the
   mechanical properties of methane-hydrate-bearing sediments determined
   through numerical simulation of drained triaxial compression tests on
   three different sand types. The adjustment of the numerical to the
   experimental results was performed for the entire stress-strain curves
   and therefore enables a good understanding of the material constitutive
   relations. New constitutive relations are suggested for the
   hydrate-related properties. An optimization process was used, finding
   separately the soil skeleton-related coefficients and the
   hydrate-related coefficients. The values of the obtained coefficients
   associated with the hydrate were found to have minor deviations from
   each other, for the three examined sand types. By separating the soil
   skeleton and the hydrate-related response, this paper suggests a
   prediction method for the mechanical response of hydrate-bearing sands.}},

Abstract = {{The use of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) antenna arrays for
   applications such as interference counter-measure, attitude
   determination and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) enhancement is attracting
   significant attention. However, precise antenna array calibration
   remains a major challenge. This paper proposes a new method for
   calibrating a GNSS antenna array using live signals and an inertial
   measurement unit (IMU). Moreover, a second method that employs the
   calibration results for the estimation of steering vectors is also
   proposed. These two methods are applied to the receiver in two modes,
   namely calibration and operation. In the calibration mode, a two-stage
   optimization for precise calibration is used; in the first stage,
   constant uncertainties are estimated while in the second stage, the
   dependency of each antenna element gain and phase patterns to the
   received signal direction of arrival (DOA) is considered for refined
   calibration. In the operation mode, a low-complexity iterative and
   fast-converging method is applied to estimate the satellite signal
   steering vectors using the calibration results. This makes the technique
   suitable for real-time applications employing a precisely calibrated
   antenna array. The proposed calibration method is applied to GPS signals
   to verify its applicability and assess its performance. Furthermore, the
   data set is used to evaluate the proposed iterative method in the
   receiver operation mode for two different applications, namely attitude
   determination and SNR enhancement.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the use of chaos in power-line communication (PLC) with
   blind equalization of the multipath effects is considered. After
   investigating equalization methods for chaotic signals, we propose an
   minimum phase-space volume-extended Kalman filter (EKF) equalization
   method to fulfill the practical requirements. First, an EKF-based method
   is used to replace the inverse filter to overcome the channel noise.
   Second, a nearest neighbor search method and a fast system
   identification method are used to reduce the computational complexity.
   Computer simulations are used to confirm the efficiency of the proposed
   method. Furthermore, real PLC channel experiments are conducted to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, corrosion of galvanised steel cord reinforcement in high
   density polyethylene (HDPE) composite pipes was studied in electrolytes
   that developed on the cord surface due to permeation of corrosive
   species through HDPE liner or damage of the liner in petroleum
   production. Parametric effects, including solution pH, temperature and
   concentration of chloride ions, were investigated by electrochemical
   corrosion measurements. A model was developed to illustrate the
   mechanism of corrosion of the cord. Corrosion of the galvanised steel
   cord includes anodic dissolution of Zn coating and the steel substrate.
   A deposit layer of zinc carbonate and iron carbonate forms on the cord
   surface to provide protection to further corrosion in the environment.
   Corrosive ions can diffuse into holes or crevices of the cord assembly
   to cause corrosion of galvanised steel wires in inner layers. The unique
   geometry of the cord assembly results in an accelerating localised
   corrosion at the crevices and holes. Generally, corrosion of the cord is
   accelerated by increased chloride concentration, reduced solution pH,
   and elevated temperature.}},

Abstract = {{The gain/phase imbalances and DC-offsets in the in-phase and quadrature
   branches in direct conversion transmitters (DCTs) are main sources of
   errors, especially at microwave frequencies and above. These impairments
   distort the spectrum of the transmitted signal and degrade the
   communications performance. In this paper, a blind technique based on
   higher order statistics is proposed to estimate the calibration
   parameters in order to compensate for these impairments. By minimizing a
   cost function composed of second and fourth moments of the modulator
   output signal, the DC-offsets, gain imbalance, and phase imbalance can
   be successively calibrated. The convergence of the proposed technique is
   also analyzed. This technique is blind in the sense that it does not
   require any prior knowledge about the DCT input signal, and is
   applicable to many communications systems including QAM, OFDM, and
   SC-FDMA. Computer simulations and experiments at 20 GHz demonstrate that
   the proposed technique can significantly improve the DCT performance in
   terms of local oscillator leakage and image suppressions.}},

Title = {{Modal analysis of confined square and rectangular cavity flows}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND FLUID FLOW}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{123-134}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Particle image velocimetry (PIV) and common-base proper orthogonal
   decomposition (CPOD) were used to quantify the velocity field within the
   separated region of confined square and rectangular cavities with
   streamwise aspect ratios of one and two, respectively. For a constant
   Reynolds number of 60,000, the flow structure within the entire domain
   of the square cavity is dominated by a nominally two-dimensional primary
   vortex. The flow unsteadiness here is manifested in the rms
   distributions, which reveal significant contributions from the
   pseudo-fluctuations due to the meandering of the primary vortex core and
   from random unsteadiness. Comparisons were made to the backward-facing
   step geometry, and in contrast, for the rectangular cavity and
   backward-facing step, large-scale unsteady flow patterns,
   three-dimensional in character, are present in the velocity field. The
   formation of these unsteady events was identified through the
   realization of instantaneous velocity fields. In contrast to the square
   cavity, the CPOD analysis reveals the presence of a ``shift mode{''} for
   the rectangular cavity, which results in spanwise variation throughout
   the entire flow field. As a conclusion, the unsteady behavior observed
   for both the rectangular-cavity and backward-facing-step flows is absent
   for the square cavity, which can be attributed to the strong coupling
   effect of the two vertical cavity boundaries at low streamwise aspect
   ratios. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal character of the rectangular
   cavity is shown to be more closely related to the backward-facing step
   than the square cavity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Orientation of a pad of SAGD well pairs in an Athabasca point bar
   deposit affects performance}},
Journal = {{MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{54}},
Pages = {{37-46}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{It has been shown that the performance of a Steam-Assisted Gravity
   Drainage (SAGD) well pair is affected by its orientation and position
   within a point bar deposit. In typical commercial operations, multiple
   horizontal wellpairs, usually arranged parallel to each other, are
   arranged in pads within oil sands reservoirs. Thus, the overall
   performance of the recovery process in a point bar is not represented by
   a single well pair but how the set of well pairs interact with the
   structure and geometry of the point bar notably including the
   arrangement of inclined heterolithic strata relative to the SAGD well
   pairs. This research describes how the point bar structure impacts the
   performance of a pad of SAGD wellpairs and the impact of pad orientation
   on performance of the pad. Also, the results show that the variability
   of the performance of the well pairs within the pad is large and thus,
   single well pair models do not provide sufficient analysis of the SAGD
   process performance due to the heterogeneity of the point bar. In other
   words, pad-scale models are required for recovery process evaluation and
   design. Furthermore, the variability of performance obtained from the
   models provides an estimate of the variability that may result for
   systems where seismic data is not available or is not sufficient to
   fully characterize the point bar. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Background aims. Previous studies have demonstrated that porcine
   synovial membrane stem cells can adhere to a cartilage defect in vivo
   through the use of a tissue-engineered construct approach. To optimize
   this model, we wanted to compare effectiveness of tissue sources to
   determine whether porcine synovial fluid, synovial membrane, bone marrow
   and skin sources replicate our understanding of synovial fluid
   mesenchymal stromal cells or mesenchymal progenitor cells from humans
   both at the population level and the single-cell level. Synovial fluid
   clones were subsequently isolated and characterized to identify cells
   with a highly characterized optimal phenotype. Methods. The
   chondrogenic, osteogenic and adipogenic potentials were assessed in
   vitro for skin, bone marrow, adipose, synovial fluid and synovial
   membrane derived stem cells. Synovial fluid cells then underwent
   limiting dilution analysis to isolate single clonal populations. These
   clonal populations were assessed for proliferative and differentiation
   potential by use of standardized protocols. Results. Porcine-derived
   cells demonstrated the same relationship between cell sources as that
   demonstrated previously for humans, suggesting that the pig may be an
   ideal preclinical animal model. Synovial fluid cells demonstrated the
   highest chondrogenic potential that was further characterized,
   demonstrating the existence of a unique clonal phenotype with enhanced
   chondrogenic potential. Conclusions. Porcine stem cells demonstrate
   characteristics similar to those in human-derived mesenchymal stromal
   cells from the same sources. Synovial fluid derived stem cells contain
   an inherent phenotype that may be optimal for cartilage repair. This
   must be more fully investigated for future use in the in vivo
   tissue-engineered construct approach in this physiologically relevant
   preclinical porcine model.}},

Abstract = {{The flexural behavior of fatigued reinforced concrete (RC) beams
   strengthened using prestressed near surface mounted (NSM) carbon
   fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) strips was investigated. Five RC beams
   were tested; one beam served as a control unstrengthened beam, while the
   other beams were prestressed to strain values corresponding to 0, 21,
   40, and 60\% of the CFRP ultimate tensile strain. The beams were
   subjected to fatigue load conditions for 3 million cycles. Thereafter,
   the postfatigue monotonic flexural behavior of the beams was compared
   with identical unfatigued beams. Test results showed that the fatigue
   loading had a minor effect on the bond performance at the concrete-epoxy
   interface of the RC beams. In general, fatigue loading did not affect
   significantly the postfatigue monotonic performance of the tested beams
   in terms of yield and ultimate loads and deflections, as compared with
   identical unfatigued beams tested in static conditions. The ductility of
   the tested beams was also evaluated and compared with similar unfatigued
   beams using several ductility models found in the literature. No fatigue
   effect on ductility (NFED) prestress strain was introduced and proposed
   as a mean to define the prestress strain at which the fatigue loading
   has no effect on the ductility of the RC strengthened beams. The NFED
   prestress strain for the particular specimens that were considered in
   this research ranges from 62 to 82\% of the CFRP ultimate tensile
   strain, which indicates that the ductility of the fatigued beams is
   higher than that of the unfatigued beams for most of the practical
   prestress values. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

   converting mechanical energy into electrical energy, which can be stored
   in charge storage devices. However, PVDF is not conductive and
   therefore, a conductive associate material is needed to transfer
   accumulated static charges into the capacitor. Fourier Transform
   Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
   were carried out to study the crystalline -phase of PVDF. There was an
   increase in -phase in the electrospun PVDF nanofibers filled with MWCNTs
   as compared with compression molded samples of neat PVDF. Incorporation
   of PANi as an intrinsically conductive polymer (ICP) and MWCNTs as
   conductive nanofiller helps the movement of static charges. Core-shell

Abstract = {{Augmenting leachate before recirculation with peroxidase enzymes is a
   novel method to increase the available carbon, and therefore the food
   supply to microorganisms at the declining phase of the anaerobic
   landfill bioreactor operation. In order to optimize the enzyme-catalyzed
   leachate recirculation process, it is necessary to identify the reaction
   mechanisms and determine rate constants. This paper presents a kinetic
   model developed to ascertain the reaction mechanisms and determine the
   rate constants for enzyme catalyzed anaerobic waste degradation. The
   maximum rate of reaction (V-max) for MnP enzyme-catalyzed reactors was
   0.076 g(TOC)/g(DS). day. The catalytic turnover number (k(cat)) of the
   MnP enzyme-catalyzed was 506.7 per day while the rate constant (k) of
   the un-catalyzed reaction was 0.012 per day. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Two approaches available for performing self-calibration are: (1)
   point-based and (2) feature-based. The reliance on planes in the
   feature-based approach is a restriction to the aim of finding a suitable
   approach for on-site calibration. Also, the requirement for a strong
   network configuration in point-based self-calibration has made it
   difficult to implement on-site. The aim of this study was to investigate
   the suitability of lowering the network station and target configuration
   requirements. Investigations of minimum network configurations were
   carried out by analysing three important elements: (1) the minimum
   number of scan stations; (2) the minimum number of real-world planes on
   which targets are distributed; and (3) the minimum number of point
   targets per plane. Also, experiments were carried to determine the
   effects of the choice of datum constraints. The results show that a
   minimum configuration of two scan stations, two planes and 16 targets
   for point-based self-calibration is suitable for on-site calibration and
   the datum choice has little effect for minimum configuration. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Electrically conducting adsorbent materials called Nyex (TM) 1000 \&
   2000 have already been reported with comparatively low adsorption
   capacity for various organic, biologically non-degradable and toxic
   compounds. Two composite adsorbents called CA(1) \& CA(2) were
   synthesized using synthetic graphite-carbon black and expanded
   graphite-carbon black respectively. The aim of developing the new
   adsorbents was to increase the adsorption capacity along with good
   electrical properties. The developed adsorbents were characterized using
   N-2 adsorption for specific surface area, Boehm surface titration for
   surface chemistry, bed electrical conductivity, laser size analyzer for
   average particle size, and scanning electron microscope (SEM) for
   particle morphology and shape. Then both the composite adsorbents were
   tested for the adsorption of acid violet 17 followed by an
   electrochemical regeneration. The adsorption study revealed that both
   the adsorbents had almost similar kinetic behavior with a significant
   increase in adsorption capacity for acid violet 17 (300 \& 26 mg(-1)
   respectively) when compared with the adsorption capacity of previously
   developed electrically conducting materials called Nyex (TM) 1000 \&
   2000 (3.5 and 9 mg g(-1) respectively). The composite adsorbent CA(2)
   was successfully electrochemically regenerated by passing an electric
   charge of 138 C g(-1) at a current density of 14 mA cm(-2) for a
   treatment time of 60 min, whereas, the composite adsorbent CA(1) could
   not be regenerated successfully. The regeneration efficiencies of CA(2)
   were obtained at around 120\% during five adsorption-regeneration
   cycles. The amount of actual charge passed of 138 C g(-1) for achieving
   100\% regeneration efficiency was found to be similar with
   stoichiometrically calculated amount of charge. The amount of electrical
   energy required to oxidize each mg of adsorbed acid violet onto CA(2)
   (24 J mg(-1)) was found to be significantly lower to that of Nyex (TM)
   1000 \& 2000 adsorbents (52 J mg(-1) \& 32 J mg(-1) respectively). (C)

   onto a cantilever, its surface area is increased by 2 orders of
   magnitude and the surface is converted into a preconcentrator. Resonant
   excitation of adsorbed molecules using IR radiation causes the
   cantilever to bend due to temperature changes originating from the
   nonradiative decay process. The porous structure of the cantilever
   increases its thermomechanical sensitivity as well as the number of
   adsorbed molecules. The system performance was demonstrated by detecting
   binary explosive mixtures under ambient conditions. The TiO2 sensor

Abstract = {{A sophisticated mechanistic simulation model was developed to describe
   the ultraviolet degradation of H2S in waste gas. The photochemical
   reactor was simulated with a model that includes 47 chemical and
   photochemical reactions involving 19 chemical species, material balances
   for each species in the model as well as the gas flow pattern.
   Simulation shows that the UV degradation of H2S in waste gas is a highly
   efficient process. The model was validated by comparing experimental
   data with model. Although the model overestimates the process efficiency
   somewhat, comparable trends were found in two different reactors,
   confirming that the model is sound and can be used for feasibility
   studies. The model predicts that H2SO4 is the main reaction product at
   very low H2S concentration, as found experimentally, and that SO2 is
   predominant at high H2S concentration. Photolysis is a simple and
   effective way to decompose H2S to less harmful products. In addition,
   the model was extended to include the photochemical degradation of NO
   and H2S + NO mixtures. The extended model includes 91 chemical and
   photochemical reactions and 30 chemical species. The model predicts that
   the ultraviolet degradation of H2S + NO mixtures is more efficient than
   the degradation of either of the compounds in isolation. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the development of a simplified model to
   efficiently represent local public transportation services in a
   large-scale travel demand model. The California Statewide Travel Demand
   Model (CSTDM) is a comprehensive model system designed and developed for
   use in transportation policy analysis and travel demand forecasting,
   including representation of both long and short distance transportation
   covering the entire state of California. A novel hybrid system is used
   to represent the full range of rail and bus transit services that are
   available. Rail services - including all long-distance rail, commuter
   rail and light rail services - are represented in the standard manner,
   using explicit node and link networks; the relevant in-vehicle and
   out-of vehicle service characteristics for journeys are determined as
   standard skims of these networks. On-street bus services are not
   represented using explicit networks; rather, the relevant in-vehicle and
   out-of-vehicle service characteristics are determined using functions of
   other transportation network variables, land use descriptors and
   relevant policy indicators. These functions are simplified econometric
   models estimated using observations of transit service obtained from
   Google Transit Data Feeds. The network and simplified components are
   integrated in order to allow transit paths with both rail and on-street
   bus components to be considered by the various travel choice models
   included in the modelling framework. This hybrid system provides a
   suitable representation of transit for an area of such size. This
   facilitates consideration of transit service policies, while obviating
   the need for extensive transit coding, a daunting task for a large area.}},

Title = {{Local troposphere augmentation for real-time precise point positioning}},
Journal = {{EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{66}},
Month = {{MAY 6}},
Abstract = {{The IGS real-time service (RTS) enables real-time precise point
   positioning (PPP) at a global scale. A long convergence time however is
   still a challenging factor. In order to reduce the convergence time,
   external troposphere corrections could be introduced to remove the
   troposphere effects on the coordinate solution. This paper proposes the
   use of a local troposphere model to augment real-time PPP. First,
   undifferenced observations from a network of multiple stations are
   processed to estimate the station-based troposphere zenith wet delay
   (ZWD). A set of local troposphere fitting coefficients are then derived
   using a proposed optimal fitting model. Finally, the determined
   troposphere fitting coefficients are broadcast to users to reduce the
   convergence time in the user solution. A continuous operating reference
   station (CORS) network is utilized to assess the performance of the
   proposed approach under quiet and active troposphere conditions. The
   numerical results show that the overall fitting precisions of the local
   troposphere model can reach 1.42 and 1.05 cm under the two troposphere
   conditions. The convergence time of the positioning solutions,
   especially the height solution, can be greatly reduced using the local
   troposphere model. The horizontal accuracy of 9.2 cm and the vertical
   accuracy of 10.1 cm are obtainable under the quiet troposphere condition
   after 20 min of initialization time, compared to the 14.7 cm horizontal
   and 21.5 cm vertical accuracies in the conventional troposphere
   estimation approach. Moreover, the horizontal accuracies of 13.0 cm and
   the vertical accuracies of 12.4 cm have also been obtained after 20 min
   under the active troposphere condition.}},

   Using Fluorescence}},
Journal = {{Jove-Journal of Visualized Experiments}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{87}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Algae are considered excellent candidates for renewable fuel sources due
   to their natural lipid storage capabilities. Robust monitoring of algal
   fermentation processes and screening for new oil-rich strains requires a
   fast and reliable protocol for determination of intracellular lipid
   content. Current practices rely largely on gravimetric methods to
   determine oil content, techniques developed decades ago that are time
   consuming and require large sample volumes. In this paper, Nile Red, a
   fluorescent dye that has been used to identify the presence of lipid
   bodies in numerous types of organisms, is incorporated into a simple,
   fast, and reliable protocol for measuring the neutral lipid content of
   Auxenochlorella protothecoides, a green alga. The method uses ethanol, a
   relatively mild solvent, to permeabilize the cell membrane before
   staining and a 96 well micro-plate to increase sample capacity during
   fluorescence intensity measurements. It has been designed with the
   specific application of monitoring bioprocess performance. Previously
   dried samples or live samples from a growing culture can be used in the
   assay.}},

Abstract = {{Core data from various North American basins with the support of limited
   amounts of data from other basins around the world have shown in the
   past that process speed or delivery speed (the ratio of permeability to
   porosity) provides a continuum between conventional, tight-, and
   shale-gas reservoirs (Aguilera 2010a). This work shows that the previous
   observation can be extended to tight-oil and shale-oil reservoirs. The
   link between the various hydrocarbon fluids is provided by the word
   ``petroleum{''} in the ``total petroleum system (TPS),{''} which
   encompasses liquid and gas hydrocarbons found in conventional, tight,
   and shale reservoirs.
   Results of the present study lead to distinctive flow units for each
   type of reservoir that can be linked empirically to gas and oil rates
   and, under favorable conditions, to production decline. To make the work
   tractable, the bulk of the data used in this paper has been extracted
   from published geologic and petroleum-engineering literature.
   The paper introduces an unrestricted/transient/interlinear transition
   flow period in a triple-porosity model for evaluating the rate
   performance of multistage-hydraulically-fractured (MSHF) tight-oil
   reservoirs. Under ideal conditions, this flow period is recognized by a
   straight line with a slope of -1.0 on log-log coordinates. However, the
   slope can change (e. g., to -0.75), depending on reservoir
   characteristics, as shown with production data from the Cardium and
   Shaunavon formations in Canada. This interlinear flow period has not
   been reported previously in the literature because the standard
   assumption for MSHF reservoirs has been that of a pseudosteady-state
   transition between the linear flow periods.
   It is concluded that there is a significant practical potential in the
   use of process speed as part of the flow-unit characterization of
   unconventional petroleum reservoirs. There is also potential for the
   evaluation of production-decline rates by the use of the triple-porosity
   model presented in this study.}},

Abstract = {{Unconventional gas is stored in extensive areas known as basin-centered
   continuous-gas accumulations. Although the estimated worldwide figures
   differ significantly, the consensus among the studies relating to
   unconventional gas resources is that the volumes are gigantic. However,
   the low permeability in these types of reservoirs usually results in a
   very low recovery factor. To help unlock these resources, this paper
   presents a new and more accurate way of simulating multistage hydraulic
   fracturing in horizontal wells in three dimensions by use of single-and
   dual-porosity reservoir models. In this approach, the geometry (not
   necessarily symmetric) and orientation of the multiple hydraulic
   fractures are driven by the prevailing stress state in the drainage
   volume of the horizontal well. Once the hydraulic-fracturing job is
   accurately modeled in three dimensions, two-way geomechanical coupling
   is used to history match the produced gas from a horizontal well drilled
   in the Nikanassin naturally fractured tight gas formation of the Western
   Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB). Traditionally, the most widely used
   approaches have their roots in semianalytical calculations simplifying
   the fracturing system to a planar feature propagating symmetrically away
   from a line source of injection. In contrast, the computed results
   presented in this study show that the incorporation of geomechanical
   effects gives a more realistic representation of the orientation and
   geometry of hydraulic fractures. Reduction in permeability of the
   natural and hydraulic fractures because of pressure depletion results in
   more-realistic production predictions compared with the case in which
   geomechanical effects are ignored. The telling conclusion, in light of
   the computed results, is that the field of hydraulic fracturing provides
   an object lesson in the need for coupled 3D geomechanical approaches.
   The method presented in this paper will help to improve gas rates and
   recoveries from reservoirs with permeability values in the nanodarcy
   scale.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the potential of two independent component analysis (ICA)
   methods, i.e., the temporal and spatiotemporal ICA, for separating
   geophysical signals in Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)
   data. These methods are based on the assumption of the statistical
   independence of the signals and thus separate the GRACE-observed mass
   changes into maximal independent signals. These two ICA methods are
   compared to the conventional principal component analysis (PCA) method.
   We test the three methods with respect to their ability to separate a
   periodic hydrological signal from a trend signal originating in the
   solid Earth or the cryosphere with simulated and Center for Space
   Research GRACE mass changes for the time period of January 2003 to
   December 2010. In addition, we investigate whether the methods are
   capable of separating hydrological annual and semiannual mass
   variations. It is shown that both ICA methods are superior to PCA when
   non-Gaussian mass variations are analyzed. Furthermore, the
   spatiotemporal ICA resolves successfully the lack of full temporal and
   spatial independence of the geophysical signals observed by GRACE both
   in global and regional simulation scenarios. Although the temporal and
   spatiotemporal ICA are nearly equivalent, both superior to PCA in the
   global GRACE analysis, the spatiotemporal ICA proves to be more
   efficient in regional applications by recover more reliably the
   postglacial rebound trend in North America and the bimodal total water
   storage variability in Africa.}},

Title = {{Ideal wind turbine performance at very low tip speed ratio}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{At very low tip speed ratios, wind turbine rotors behave similarly to
   stationary wings for which the well-known lifting line analysis gives
   the optimal loading. Lifting line analysis is applied to a stationary
   rotor of N blades for N = 1, 2, and 4. Analytic (for N = 1 and 2) or
   semi-analytic solutions (for N = 4) agree with the classical results
   obtained by conformal mapping. The present solutions compare well with
   numerical solutions for the Goldstein function for optimally loaded
   propeller or wind turbine rotors at low tip speed ratio. In all cases,
   the induced velocity is linear with radius. Assuming this result applies
   for all N, lifting line analysis is recast as a singular integral
   equation whose solution agrees with Goldstein's obtained using the same
   conformal mappings as in his general analysis for any tip speed ratio.
   The implication is that the assumed induced velocity distribution is
   correct, and is, therefore, fundamentally different from that at high
   tip speed ratios when the induced velocity is inversely proportional to
   radius. For any N, the power and thrust coefficients become proportional
   to the square of the tip speed ratio and the tip loss factor alters
   significantly from the common form used at higher tip speed ratios.
   Extending the analysis to finite pitch was not achieved but several
   important results were obtained, including the behaviour of the tip loss
   as N varies at low tip speed ratio. The behaviour is complex and the
   resulting tip loss factor exceeds unity for a significant part of the
   blade. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, steel fibre reinforced polymers (SFRP) sheets have been
   introduced for the repair and rehabilitation of concrete structures. Few
   researchers studied the behaviour of the concrete columns wrapped with
   SFRP sheets; however, several critical parameters such as the cost and
   ductility effectiveness of the SFRP wrapped concrete columns have been
   lightly addressed. Thus, the main objective of this paper is to study
   the cost and ductility effectiveness of SFRP wrapped concrete columns
   and compare the results with the conventionally used carbon FRP (CFRP)
   wrapped concrete columns. In addition, an analytical procedure to
   predict the cost effectiveness of SFRP wrapped concrete columns is also
   suggested, from which, a parametric study was conducted. The parametric
   study investigated the effect of the concrete strength, the number of
   SFRP layers, and the size and slenderness effects on the cost
   effectiveness of the concrete columns wrapped with SFRP sheets. The
   results from the cost and ductility effectiveness study indicated that
   the SFRP wrapped concrete columns showed enhanced performance over the
   CFRP wrapped concrete columns. The suggested analytical procedure proved
   to be a reliable and accurate method to predict the cost effectiveness
   parameter of SFRP wrapped concrete columns. The parametric study showed
   the significant impact of the investigated parameters on the cost
   effectiveness of concrete columns wrapped with SFRP sheets.}},

Title = {{A new tool for prospect evaluation in shale gas reservoirs}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{18}},
Pages = {{90-103}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, unconventional gas (particularly shale gas - SG) has
   played an increasing role in satisfying gas demand both in North America
   and beyond. Despite extensive development, minimal work has been done to
   develop tools and methodologies for SG prospect analysis. Due to the
   complexity and variability among SG prospects, it is crucial to not only
   investigate all possible prospects, but also to investigate all areas
   within the selected prospect to pick pilot locations which offer the
   best potential for commercial success. In addition, due to the
   complexity of SG reservoirs, many authors have suggested that stochastic
   techniques should be used to assist in quantifying the risk and
   uncertainty of the analysis.
   This paper discusses a new tool that was developed specifically for SG
   exploration and development. This tool combines the latest production
   data analysis and rate forecasting techniques with a simple, yet
   rigorous stochastic method for analyzing pilot well locations. The paper
   discusses the rate forecasting techniques used in the tool, as well as
   the tool development and application. Both simulated and field cases are
   provided to demonstrate the new methodology. This paper is an extension
   of the work presented by Williams-Kovacs and Clarkson (2011). (C) 2014

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This study investigated the mechanical behavior of a wet granular soil
   at low moisture content in which isolated pendular water bridges
   (menisci) at the interface of the solid particles give rise to capillary
   forces in addition to existing interparticle contact forces. We derived
   a single effective stress tensor encapsulating evolving liquid bridges,
   packing, interfaces, and water saturation. Apart from the fact that the
   stress due to contact forces is dependent on the fabric, we found that
   the so-called suction (capillary) stress arising from liquid bridges is
   inevitably direction dependent, i.e., anisotropic. The latter is at odds
   with the common belief that capillary stress is isotropic. We
   demonstrate that capillary stress is a function of the distribution of
   liquid bridges, degree of saturation, as well as particle packing, and
   thus provide an adequate effective stress definition to describe both
   the constitutive behavior and strength of unsaturated media. We
   conducted discrete element modeling simulations of triaxial compression
   tests of pendular-state granular samples at different matric suctions to
   verify the anisotropic nature of the capillary stress and resulting
   strength contributions to validate the proposed effective stress
   equation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a 12.5-Gb/s on-chip oscilloscope (OCO) circuit to
   measure eye diagrams and jitter histograms of high-speed digital
   signals. The proposed circuit adopts a novel architecture to capture

   of measuring the eye openings and jitter of the input signals without
   the need to construct the whole eye diagram which makes it a suitable
   candidate for eye-opening monitor circuits. An asynchronous sampling
   technique and an efficient algorithm are employed in this research to
   decrease the area of the OCO as well as its processing time. The
   proposed circuit is fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS technology and the
   measurement results show sub-picosecond resolution when the input
   signals consist of a 10-GHz clock signal and a 12.5-Gb/s pseudorandom
   binary sequence. The OCO circuit has a power consumption of 1.9 mW, and

   obtained was 57 MPa for Mg-AZ31/Ni-Cu/Ti-6Al-4V configuration and in
   both configurations, the increase in bonding time resulted in a decrease

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new systematic design methodology was developed for hot
   oil system by changing arrangement of heat exchanger network from
   parallel to mixed series/parallel. In re-circulating hot oil systems,
   hot oil from the hot oil generator is supplied to a network of heaters
   that usually has a parallel configuration. However, re-use of hot oil
   between different heating duties enables hot oil networks to be designed
   with series arrangements. This allows better hot oil generator
   performance and increased heating capacity, both in the context of new
   design and retrofit. First, the hot oil generator and the hot oil
   network were examined separately, in order to discuss the nature of hot
   oil system design. A model of hot oil systems was then developed to
   examine the performance of the hot oil generator to recirculation flow
   rate and return temperature, as well as to predict heating efficiency.
   In second step, the design of the overall hot oil system was developed
   by investigating the interactions between the hot oil network design and
   the hot oil generator performance. Debottlenecking procedures for the
   design of hot oil systems was also developed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{As a first step toward characterizing coherent structures within the
   atmospheric surface layer (ASL), measurements obtained via a large-scale
   particle tracking velocimetry (LS-PTV) system were validated against
   wind-measurement station data as well as canonical turbulent boundary
   layer studies. The LS-PTV system resolves three-dimensional, Lagrangian
   tracks over a 16 m(3) volume. Mean-velocity measurements, as well as
   vertical and shear Reynolds-stress measurements, generally agreed with
   wind-measurement station data and Reynolds-stress profiles referenced
   from literature. The probability distributions for streamwise, spanwise
   and vertical velocity-fluctuation components appear normally distributed
   about zero. Furthermore, the probability distributions for all three
   components of Lagrangian acceleration were exponential and followed the
   parametrization curve from LaPorta et al. (Lett Nat 409: 1017-1019,
   2001). Lastly, the vorticity probability distributions were exponential
   and symmetric about zero, which matches findings from Balint et al.
   (Fluid Mech 228: 53-86, 1991). The vorticity intensity measured by the
   LS-PTV system was less than values from Priyadarshana et al. (Fluid Mech
   570: 307-346, 2007), which is attributed to the low spatial resolution.
   However, the average spacing of 0.5 m between tracer particles is deemed
   sufficient for the future characterization of vortical structures within
   the ASL.}},

Abstract = {{Distillation assays provide the most widely used characterization data
   for modeling crude oils in refinery processes but can only define a
   relatively small fraction of the boiling curve for heavy oils. One way
   to extend the distillation range for heavy oils is to lower the
   distillation pressure while still avoiding thermal cracking
   temperatures. A vacuum distillation apparatus (DVFA-I) that was
   previously used to measure the vapor pressure of heavy components was
   modified to fractionate heavy oils and bitumens. The modified apparatus
   (DVFA-II) is a batch distillation system without reflux operating at
   pressures down to approximately 0.01 Pa, compared with 100 Pa for a
   conventional vacuum distillation. With the standard procedure developed
   for DVFA-II, up to 50 wt \% of a Western Canadian bitumen was distilled
   into eight cuts plus a residue. This is an improvement over the 26 wt \%
   distilled by a spinning band vacuum apparatus. The cumulative weight
   percent distilled was repeatable to within 2.3\% for a given boiling
   point range. The densities and molecular weights of the cuts from two
   fractionations increased monotonically versus the weight percent
   distilled and were repeatable to within 0.18 and 4.0\%, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{In Part I of this two-part series, a recently developed deep-vacuum
   fractionation apparatus (DVFA-II) was standardized and used to
   fractionate heavy oil samples by boiling point at a pressure below 1 Pa.
   Up to 50 wt \% of a Western Canadian bitumen was distilled, compared
   with 26 wt \% distilled with conventional spinning band distillation
   (SBD), and eight cuts were recovered. Here, an interconversion technique
   is developed to determine the normal boiling point (NBP) curve from the
   low-pressure boiling point data collected using DVFA-II. A simultaneous
   correlation of vapor pressure and heat capacity data based on the
   Clapeyron equation was used to determine the NBP of each cut. Of the
   vapor pressure correlations considered, the three-parameter Cox equation
   best fit the data, with average absolute relative deviations within 7\%
   and 1\% for the vapor pressure and heat capacity data (Delta C'(exp)),
   respectively. The estimated maximum and minimum errors in the calculated
   NBPs were 2.2\% and -2.5\% (8 and 9 K), respectively, and the calculated
   NBPs were within 2\% of the SBD data. It was demonstrated that the
   distillation data for a heavy oil sample follow a Gaussian distribution
   and therefore that the NBP curve of heavy oil maltenes can be
   represented well using a Gaussian extrapolation.}},

Abstract = {{The main recovery mechanism in the solvent-based bitumen recovery
   processes is gravity drainage. The density of heated bitumen or diluted
   bitumen at operational conditions is required to predict the production
   rate and cumulative oil recovery. In this manuscript, the densities of
   bitumen, pentane, and their mixtures at different pentane weight
   fractions (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5) have accurately been
   measured. The measurements were conducted under conditions applicable
   for both in situ recovery methods and pipeline transportation of heavy
   oil. The experiments were taken using Athabasca bitumen at temperatures
   varying from ambient up to 200 degrees C and at pressures up to 10 MPa.
   The volume change upon mixing for the mixtures is evaluated from the
   experimental results, and the influence of pressure, temperature, and
   solvent weight fraction on the volume change upon mixing and density is
   studied. The density data are also represented with three different
   approaches considering no volume change, excess volume, effective liquid
   densities, and equation of state. The results indicated that the mixture
   data are well-predicted using equation of state and effective liquid
   densities with average absolute relative deviations (AARD) of 0.55\% and
   0.57\%, respectively.}},

Title = {{Separation of Toluene-Insoluble Solids in the Slurry Oil from a Residual
   Fluidized Catalytic Cracking Unit: Determination of the Solid Content
   and Sequential Selective Separation of Solid Components}},
Journal = {{ENERGY \& FUELS}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Removing solid impurities inside slurry oil from residual fluidized
   catalytic cracking (RFCC) is critical for efficient use of its aromatic
   hydrocarbons, and selective separation of the solid components is also
   an important issue of recycling valuable resources for catalyst and
   carbon material. Different separation methods were employed to isolate
   the solids and their components in the slurry oil from a RFCC unit, and
   the resultant solids and components were comprehensively characterized
   by elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), and
   energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, etc. Results show that the
   content of toluene-insoluble solids in the slurry oil varies from
   separation methods employed. The solid components, i.e., catalyst
   particles and coke powders, can be sequentially separated, and the
   choice of an appropriate separation method is critical for accurate
   determination of the solid content in a RFCC slurry oil. When an
   aliphatic solvent is used for dilution and, after filtering, an aromatic
   solvent is employed for extraction, the solids can be completely
   separated and the total content of toluene-insoluble solids is thus
   obtained. Also, selective separation of the two major components of the
   solid has also been established. When the slurry oil is digested with
   hot toluene, followed by filtration and extraction with hot toluene,
   catalyst particles can be separated at a selectivity of 71.0 wt \%.
   Afterward, when the filtrate is digested with a substantially aliphatic
   solvent, followed by filtration and extraction with hot toluene, fine
   coke powders are separated at a selectivity of 96.9 wt \%. This
   selective separation opens a possible way to recover catalyst and obtain
   fine coke powders as valuable resources from a single RFCC slurry oil.
   At the same time, the slurry oil may thus be highly clarified, which
   might find a variety of flexible applications. Finally, the mechanism
   for particle aggregation and clustering for the efficient separation of
   solids from heavy oils, such as slurry oil from a fluidized catalytic
   cracking (FCC)/RFCC unit, has been postulated, where upon adding an
   aliphatic solvent, heavy asphaltenes precipitate to be adsorbed on the
   surfaces of fine particles and function as natural binders to aggregate
   and cluster the fine particles, rendering separation of nanosized coke
   fines possible.}},

Abstract = {{The electrically conducting and partially porous graphite based
   adsorbent (called NyexTM 2000) was tested for its adsorption capacity
   and electrochemical regeneration ability for the removal of phenol from
   aqueous solution. Nyex (TM) 2000 was tested in comparison with Nyex (TM)
   1000, which is currently being used for a number of industrial waste
   water treatment applications. Nyex (TM) 1000 exhibited small adsorption
   capacity of 0.1 mg g(-1) for phenol because of having small specific
   surface area of 1 m(2) g(-1). In contrast, Nyex (TM) 2000 with specific
   surface area of 17 m(2) g(-1) delivered an adsorption capacity of 0.8 mg
   g(-1), which was eight-fold higher than that of Nyex (TM) 1000. Nyex
   (TM) 2000 was successfully electrochemically regenerated by passing a
   current of 0.5 A, charge passed of 31 C g(-1) for a treatment time of 45
   minutes. These electrochemical parameters were comparable to Nyex (TM)
   1000 for which a current of 0.5 A, charge passed of 5 C g(-1) for a
   treatment time of 20 minutes were applied for complete oxidation of
   adsorbed phenol. The comparatively high charge density was found to be
   required for Nyex (TM) 2000, which is justified with its higher
   adsorption capacity. The FTIR results validated the mineralization of
   adsorbed phenol into CO2 and H2O except the formation of few
   by-products, which were in traces when compared with the concentration
   of phenol removed from aqueous solution. The electrical energy as
   required for electrochemical oxidation of phenol adsorbed onto Nyex (TM)
   1000 \& 2000 was found to be 214 and 196 J mg(-1), respectively. The
   comparatively low energy requirement for electrochemical oxidation using
   Nyex (TM) 2000 is consistent with its higher bed electrical
   conductivity, which is twice that of Nyex (TM) 1000.}},

Abstract = {{A series of conjugated polymer/TiO2 (CP/TiO2) nanocomposites were

   The photocatalytic activities of CP/TiO2 nanocomposites were
   investigated by monitoring the degradation of methyl orange aqueous
   solution under visible light irradiation. The effects of preparation
   conditions (such as the mass ratio of PB to TiO2 in suspensions for
   PB/TiO2 preparation, heat-treatment temperature and time) of CP/TiO2
   nanocomposites on their visible light photocatalytic activity were
   investigated. The results show that the CP/TiO2 nanocomposites have
   excellent visible light photocatalytic activity. As the content of
   conjugated polymer on the TiO2 surface, heat-treatment temperature and

Abstract = {{Due to the presence of dependence linkages, changing one element of a
   product (e.g., functions and components) can trigger changes to other
   related elements and lead to numerous possible propagation paths (i.e.,
   the ``snowball effect{''}). To address this issue, this paper proposes
   the matrix-based clustering method. Two matrix models are considered in
   this research: design structure matrix for the linkages of components
   and domain mapping matrix for the linkages of functions and parameters.
   After denoting some product elements as ``target{''} representing the
   initial changes, the clustering method is used to form and classify the
   clusters according to the change impacts from target elements. The
   interfaces between the clusters are also identified to manage the
   propagation process. The purpose of this method is to provide the
   cluster and interface information for implementing change requests. In
   view of the methodical advancement, the clustering method can tailor a
   clustered matrix for specific change requests and handle two types of
   matrices. Two examples have been used to demonstrate and support the
   utility and flexibility of the proposed method to manage matrix-based
   change propagation.}},

   were gate width and part thickness. The observation clearly showed the
   development of melt frontier and gas escape, which were affected by
   varying the selected parameters. The results showed that the relative

Title = {{New Models for Scattering Bias Compensation in Time-of-Flight Range
   Camera Self-Calibration}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SURVEYING ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{The geometric calibration of time-of-flight range cameras is a necessary
   quality assurance measure performed to estimate the interior orientation
   parameters. Self-calibration from a network of range imagery of an array
   of signalized targets arranged in one or two planes can be used for this
   purpose. The latter configuration requires the addition of a parametric
   model for internal light scattering biases in the range observations to
   the background plane due to the presence of the foreground plane. In a
   previous study of MESA Imaging SwissRanger range cameras, such a model
   was developed and shown to be effective. A new parametric model is
   proposed here because the scattering error behavior is camera model
   dependent. The new model was tested on two pmdtechnologies range
   cameras, the CamCube 3.0 and CamBoard nano, and its effectiveness was
   demonstrated both graphically and statistically. The improvement gained
   in the root-mean square of the self-calibration range residuals of 22
   and 32\%, respectively, indicates the model's ability to compensate for
   the scattering error. A reduction in correlation between the camera
   position and rangefinder offset of up to 10\% was achieved, which is
   consistent with previous findings. In addition, a systematic approach
   for designing the optimal separation between the foreground and
   background planes is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Delignification is critical in the production of biofuel from a
   potentially abundant renewable resource, lignocellulosic waste. One of
   the classes of lignolytic enzymes are peroxidases. Manganese sulphate
   (Mn2+) has a significant impact on the peroxidase activity of lignolytic
   fungi. Along with induction, the suppression of peroxidase activity by
   Mn2+ has been observed. Peroxidase regulation is governed by three
   critical Mn2+ concentrations: the minimum inductive concentration (MIC),
   the peak concentration (PC) and the minimum suppressive concentration
   (MSC). The induction and suppression of enzyme activity were not
   associated with fungal growth capacity, but with a specific enzyme
   response to the nutritional conditions. Manipulation of the carbon and
   nitrogen sources shifted the peroxidase suppression by Mn2+ to high
   concentrations and, hence, increased the peroxidase tolerance to Mn2+
   and, consequently, peak peroxidase activities. The manipulation of
   carbon and nitrogen sources allowed increasing the peak concentrations
   of Mn2+ and corresponding peroxidase activity up to 0.5 mg/mL and 180.70
   AU (173\% increase compared to standard) in C. subvermispora, and up to
   0.05 mg/mL and 151.23 AU in D. squalens (91\% increase compared to
   standard). Thus, manipulation of carbon and nitrogen sources is a useful
   tool in enhancing fungi peroxidase tolerance to Mn2+ and improving the
   delignification of lignocellulosic biomass by fungi to prepare an easily
   consumable substrate for economically viable biofuel production.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BRIDGE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{The models for prediction of creep in codes and design guides are mainly
   based on tests in which the load is sustained for a number of years,
   rarely exceeding 10; however, most models predict that creep reaches its
   extreme after approximately 30 years. An exception is the frequently
   accepted Model B3; it predicts indefinite increase of creep with the
   logarithm of the number of days of sustained loading. Analysis of
   deflection using Model B3 of a large number of bridges agrees with
   measured deflection in terms of magnitude and continued increasing
   tendency. Modern design requires satisfactory serviceability sustainable
   for a long life span. The absolute value of camber or deflection must
   not be excessive. This paper shows that by adopting Model B3, combined
   with appropriate prestressing, it is possible to satisfy this
   requirement for 125 years.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, acrylic tri-block-copolymers of different compositions
   and constituents were used to modify an epoxy resin. In epoxy the
   block-copolymers self-assembled to generate different nanostructured
   phases. Spherical micelles and vesicles were formed due to preferential
   interactions among constituents of the blends. The effect of modifier
   concentration and morphology on the resulting mechanical properties was
   investigated. At a modifier content of 5 wt\% a more than threefold
   increase in strain energy release rate was observed relative to the
   unfilled epoxy for the block-copolymer/epoxy systems studied. This
   improvement was accompanied by slight reductions in tensile stiffness,
   strength and glass transition temperature of developed epoxy blends.
   Microstructural studies revealed that during crack propagation, vesicle
   and micelle structures respectively underwent debonding and cavitation
   followed by shear yielding of the substrate matrix. POLYM. ENG. SCI.,

Abstract = {{Context: The web has had a significant impact on all aspects of our
   society. As our society relies more and more on the web, the
   dependability of web applications has become increasingly important. To
   make these applications more dependable, for the past decade researchers
   have proposed various techniques for testing web-based software
   applications. Our literature search for related studies retrieved 193
   papers in the area of web application testing, which have appeared
   between 2000 and 2013.
   Objective: As this research area matures and the number of related
   papers increases, it is important to systematically identify, analyze,
   and classify the publications and provide an overview of the trends and
   empirical evidence in this specialized field.
   Methods: We systematically review the body of knowledge related to
   functional testing of web application through a systematic literature
   review (SLR) study. This SLR is a follow-up and complimentary study to a
   recent systematic mapping (SM) study that we conducted in this area. As
   part of this study, we pose three sets of research questions, define
   selection and exclusion criteria, and synthesize the empirical evidence
   in this area.
   Results: Our pool of studies includes a set of 95 papers (from the 193
   retrieved papers) published in the area of web application testing
   between 2000 and 2013. The data extracted during our SLR study is
   available through a publicly-accessible online repository. Among our
   results are the followings: (1) the list of test tools in this area and
   their capabilities, (2) the types of test models and fault models
   proposed in this domain, (3) the way the empirical studies in this area
   have been designed and reported, and (4) the state of empirical evidence
   and industrial relevance.
   Conclusion: We discuss the emerging trends in web application testing,
   and discuss the implications for researchers and practitioners in this
   area. The results of our SLR can help researchers to obtain an overview
   of existing web application testing approaches, fault models, tools,
   metrics and empirical evidence, and subsequently identify areas in the
   field that require more attention from the research community. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The disinfection performance of a unique process of adsorption combined
   with electrochemical treatment is evaluated. A flake graphite
   intercalation compound adsorbent was used, which is effective for the
   removal of organic contaminants and is amenable to anodic
   electrochemical regeneration. Adsorption of Escherichia coli on the
   graphite flake was followed by electrochemical treatment under a range
   of experimental conditions in a sequential batch reactor. The adsorption
   of E. coli cells was found to be a fast process and was capable of
   removing >99.98\% of cells from solution after 5 min with a ca.
   6.5-log(10) reduction in E. coli concentration after 10 mm. With
   electrochemical treatment the adsorbent could be reused, with no
   decrease in E. coli adsorption observed over five cycles. In the
   presence of chloride, >8.5-log(10) reduction of E. coli concentration
   was achieved. Disinfection was found to be less effective in the absence
   of chloride. However, selection of appropriate operating conditions
   enabled effective disinfection in a chloride free system, reducing the
   potential for formation of disinfection by-products. The energy
   consumption required to achieve >8.5-log(10) disinfection was 2-7 kWh

Abstract = {{Assessing joint function following trauma and its inter-relation with
   degenerative changes requires an understanding of the normal state of
   structural loading in the joint. Very few studies have attempted to
   reproduce joint specific in vivo motions in vitro to quantify the actual
   loads carried by different tissues within the knee joint. The most
   significant challenge in this area is the very high sensitivity of the
   loads in joint structures to motion reproduction accuracy. A novel
   testing platform for assessing knee joint mechanics is described,
   comprised of a highly accurate (0.3 +/- A 0.1 mm, 0.3 +/- A 0.1A
   degrees) six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) instrumented spatial linkage
   (ISL) for in vivo joint kinematic assessments and a unique 6-DOF
   parallel robotic manipulator. A position feedback system (ISL and
   position controller) is used for accurate reproduction of in vivo joint
   motions and estimation of ``in situ{''} joint/tissue loads. The parallel
   robotic manipulator provides excellent stiffness and repeatability in
   reproducing physiological motions in 6-DOF, compared to the commonly
   used serial robots. The position feedback system provides real-time
   feedback data to the robot to reproduce in vivo motions and
   significantly enhances motion reproduction accuracy by adjusting for
   robot end-effector movements. Using this combined robot-ISL system, in
   vivo motions can be reproduced in vitro with very high accuracy (0.1 mm,
   0.1A degrees). Our results indicate that this level of accuracy is
   essential for meaningful estimation of tissue loads during gait. Using
   this novel testing platform, we have determined the normal load-carrying
   characteristics of different tissues within the ovine knee joint. The
   application of this testing system will continue to increase our
   understanding of normal and pathological joint states.}},

Abstract = {{The collagenous structure of the knee menisci is integral to the
   mechanical integrity of the tissue and the knee joint. The tie-fibre
   structure of the tissue has largely been neglected, despite previous
   studies demonstrating its correlation with radial stiffness. This study
   has evaluated the structure of the tie-fibres of bovine menisci using 2D
   and 3D microscopy techniques. Standard collagen and proteoglycan (PG)
   staining and 2D light microscopy techniques were conducted. For the
   first time, the collagenous structure of the menisci was evaluated using
   3D, second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy. This technique
   facilitated the imaging of collagen structure in thick sections (50-100
   mu m). Imaging identified that tie-fibres of the menisci arborize from
   the outer margin of the meniscus toward the inner tip. This arborization
   is associated with the structural arrangement of the circumferential
   fibres. SHG microscopy has definitively demonstrated the 3D organization
   of tie-fibres in both sheets and bundles. The hierarchy of the structure
   is related to the organization of circumferential fascicles. Large
   tie-fibre sheets bifurcate into smaller sheets to surround
   circumferential fascicles of decreasing size. The tie-fibres emanate
   from the lamellar layer that appears to surround the entire meniscus. At
   the tibial and femoral surfaces these tie-fibre sheets branch
   perpendicularly into the meniscal body. The relationship between
   tie-fibres and blood vessels in the menisci was also observed in this
   study. Tie-fibre sheets surround the blood vessels and an associated
   PG-rich region. This subunit of the menisci has not previously been
   described. The size of tie-fibre sheets surrounding the vessels appeared
   to be associated with the size of blood vessel. These structural
   findings have implications in understanding the mechanics of the
   menisci. Further, refinement of the complex structure of the tie-fibres
   is important in understanding the consequences of injury and disease in
   the menisci. The framework of meniscus architecture also defines
   benchmarks for the development of tissue-engineered replacements in the
   future.}},

Abstract = {{An initial attempt to adapt the Peng-Robinson EOS, with Huron-Vidal
   mixing rules, for the prediction of phase equilibrium in the production
   of biodiesel is described in this work. Six vegetable oils and methanol
   were chosen to constitute the feedstock. In order to describe the
   chemical composition of the vegetable oils, a fuel surrogate technique
   was employed. In regressing the binary interaction parameters for the
   equation of state, it was found that the necessary binary phase
   equilibrium data were seldom available in the literature. Thus, the EOS
   was formulated as a predictive model in which the KT-UNIFAC method was
   used to assist in generating binary interaction parameters. The EOS was
   subsequently tested by computing phase equilibrium and then comparing
   the results to the small amount of available experimental data. It was
   found that the predictions ranged from less than satisfactory to very
   good. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{109}},
Pages = {{136-146}},
Month = {{APR 19}},
Abstract = {{Reactive miscible now displacements in homogeneous porous media with
   time dependent injection velocities are analyzed. The displacements
   consist of periodic cycles that involve alternating stages of injection
   and extraction. Nonlinear simulations are used and the dynamics of the
   flows are characterized qualitatively as well as quantitatively in terms
   of the amount of generated chemical product. The simulations revealed
   that, when compared with constant velocity flows with the same overall
   amount of injected fluid, Lime dependent displacements show drastically
   different flow structures and chemical productivity. These differences
   are strongly dependent on the period of the velocity cycles and the
   scenario of whether the displacement is initiated through an injection
   or an extraction process. In particular, for non-monotonic viscosity
   profiles, displacements with larger period result in stronger chemical
   production while the effects of the velocity scenarios depend on the
   nature of the instability at the initial front. Moreover, for
   monotonically decreasing viscosity profiles known to be stable under
   constant injection velocity, only displacements starting with extraction
   can trigger instabilities and increase the amount of chemical product.
   Finally for monotonically increasing viscosity profiles, displacements
   that start with injection tend to generate more chemical product than
   the constant velocity flow and its counterpart starting with an
   extraction instead. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   One main challenge of performing automatic TWR data processing including

   the walls. In the work presented here, we propose a practical and
   effective multiple target detection and tracking system for TWR. While
   background subtraction and envelope detection are used to reduce the
   false detected targets, an effective multiple target tracker is employed
   to further suppress the TWR false tracks. Using an experimental TWR, it
   is shown here that the proposed TWR data processing unit can effectively
   reduce false targets and false tracks and produce a good final
   surveillance picture for tracking human movement behind the walls.}},

Title = {{Well/Wormhole Model of Cold Heavy-Oil Production With Sand}},
Journal = {{SPE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{260-269}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Cold heavy-oil production with sand (CHOPS) is a nonthermal
   heavy-oil-recovery technique used primarily in the heavy-oil belt in
   eastern Alberta, Canada, and western Saskatchewan, Canada. Under CHOPS,
   typical recovery factors are between 5 and 15\%, with the average being
   less than 10\%. This leaves approximately 90\% of the oil in the ground
   after the process becomes uneconomic, making CHOPS wells and fields
   prime candidates for enhanced-oil-recovery (EOR) follow-up process field
   optimization. CHOPS wells show an enhancement in production rates
   compared with conventional primary production, which is explained by the
   formation of high-permeability channels known as wormholes. The
   formation of wormholes has been shown to exist in laboratory experiments
   as well as field experiments conducted with fluorescein dyes. The major
   mechanisms for CHOPS production are foamy oil flow, sand failure (or
   fluidization), and sand production. Foamy oil flow aids in mobilizing
   sand and reservoir fluids, leading to the formation of wormholes. Foamy
   oil behavior cannot be effectively modeled by conventional
   pressure/volume/temperature (PVT) behavior. Here, a new well/wormhole
   model for CHOPS is proposed. The well/wormhole model uses a kinetic
   model to deal with foamy oil behavior, and sand is mobilized because of
   sand failure determined by a minimum fluidization velocity. The
   individual wormholes are modeled in a simulator as an extension of a
   production well. The model grows the well/wormhole dynamically within
   the reservoir according to a growth criterion set by the fluidization
   velocity of sand along the existing well/wormhole. If the growth
   criterion is satisfied, the wormhole extends in the appropriate
   direction; otherwise, production continues from the existing
   well/wormhole until the criterion is met. The proposed model
   incorporates sand production and reproduces the general production
   behavior of a typical CHOPS well.}},

Title = {{On the Stability of the Edge of a Steam-Assisted-Gravity-Drainage Steam
   Chamber}},
Journal = {{SPE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{280-288}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) is a successful thermal-recovery
   technique applied in oil-sand reservoirs in which the viscosity of the
   oil (bitumen) is typically in the hundreds of thousands to millions of
   centipoise. For the in-situ production from bitumen reservoirs, bitumen
   viscosity must be reduced to achieve the mobility required to flow
   toward the production well. Many factors influence the efficiency and
   rate at which bitumen is mobilized. The controlling feature of
   steam-based recovery processes is heat transfer from the steam chamber
   to the formation-the greater the heat flux, the larger the oil volume
   heated, and the higher the oil-drainage rate. Previous studies have
   demonstrated that instability at the steam-chamber edge can enhance heat
   transfer there by creating limited-amplitude steam fingers that enlarge
   the heat-transfer area, thus leading to greater thermal efficiency of
   the recovery process. This, in turn, increases oil production. At this
   point, stability studies have focused on the instability between steam
   and oil at the edge of the chamber-none has examined the case between
   steam condensate and oil. In the research documented here, the stability
   between steam condensate and bitumen at the edge of the chamber is
   explored. Here, a steam-pressure diffusion equation at the moving
   chamber interface is derived. The perturbations of the pressure and
   condensate velocity are substituted into the pressure diffusion equation
   and Darcy's law to realize a linear-stability equation governing the
   growth of disturbances at the interface. The results show that the
   stability is controlled by moving-interface velocity and reservoir
   water-phase hydraulic diffusivity.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present and analyze four efficient models that produce
   significantly improved results by optimizing conflicting power and skew
   objectives in the clock network buffer sizing problem. Each model is in
   geometric programming format and has certain advantages, such as maximum
   reduction in power, robustness to process variation, and striking a
   balance between skew and power optimization. The buffer sizing problem
   is formulated as a geometric programming problem to provide globally
   optimal solutions to the four models. We also show that a geometric
   programming multiobjective model can be used to optimize both power and
   skew without requiring any tuning from a designer. The presented
   self-tuning multiobjective formulation not only provides optimal
   solutions for buffer sizes, but also finds the tuning parameters that
   result in overall combined reduction in power and skew without loss of
   convexity. The effectiveness of the models are illustrated on several
   publicly available benchmarks. The models provide on average 40\% to
   60\% improvement in power while reducing skew in several cases. We have
   also proposed a smart heuristic for discretization of the continuous
   geometric programming solution that preserves skew and power. Finally,
   we provide a guideline for designers to decide which one of the proposed
   models is the most appropriate for their needs.}},

Abstract = {{Context-awareness is an interesting topic in mobile navigation scenarios
   where the context of the application is highly dynamic. Using

   different services based on different contextswhere contexts are related
   to the user's activity and the device placement. Context-aware systems
   are concerned with the following challenges which are addressed in this
   paper: context acquisition, context understanding, and context-aware
   application adaptation. The proposed approach in this paper is using
   low-cost sensors in a multi-level fusion scheme to improve the accuracy

Abstract = {{Naturally occurring gas hydrates are regarded as an important future
   source of energy and considerable efforts are currently being invested
   to develop methods for an economically viable recovery of this resource.
   The recovery of natural gas from gas hydrate deposits has been studied
   by a number of researchers. Depressurization of the reservoir is seen as
   a favorable method because of its relatively low energy requirements.
   While lowering the pressure in the production well seems to be a
   straight forward approach to destabilize methane hydrates, the intrinsic
   kinetics of CH4-hydrate decomposition and fluid flow lead to complex
   processes of mass and heat transfer within the deposit. In order to
   develop a better understanding of the processes and conditions governing
   the production of methane from methane hydrates it is necessary to study
   the sensitivity of gas production to the effects of factors such as
   pressure, temperature, thermal conductivity, permeability, porosity on
   methane recovery from naturally occurring gas hydrates. A simplified
   model is the base for an ensemble of reservoir simulations to study
   which parameters govern productivity and how these factors might

Abstract = {{Increasing competition in the global marketplace demands products be

   environments, and technology advancement. Adaptable design can be
   employed for developing adaptable products and systems that can be
   changed, such as reconfigured and upgraded, during product operation

   subject to influence of uncertainties that lead to variations of
   functional performance, robust design needs to be carried out to
   identify the design whose functional performance is the least sensitive
   to the variations of product and operating parameters. This research
   aims at developing a robust adaptable design approach such that the
   product is adaptable to various changes in requirements and parameters
   during the product operation stage, meanwhile the product functional
   performance measures are the least sensitive to parameter variations.
   First, the requirements, parameters, and variations of these parameters
   are defined as numerical functions of a time parameter. Then,
   mathematical models are established to describe the relationships among
   product design/operating parameters, functional performances, and
   variations of these parameters and performances. Furthermore, an
   optimization-based model is developed to achieve the robust adaptable

Abstract = {{Iron precipitate was produced with 0.1 M FeCl3 and bound with the amino
   or hydroxyl groups of the granules surface, accompanied with removal of

   untreated granules, peaked at pH 3.4 at a maximum capacity of 22.6 mg
   g(-1) of dry mass. The intraparticle diffusion and film diffusion
   resistances controlled the Sb(V) adsorption onto the Fe(III)-treated

Abstract = {{A comparative study on CO2 gasification kinetics of flax straw char
   produced by two different processes, namely, torrefaction and pyrolysis
   was investigated using a TGA (thermogravimetric analyzer). The objective
   of this research was to investigate the diffusion and surface reactions
   that occur during the CO2 gasification of the torrefied and pyrolyzed
   char particles. Gasification experiments were carried out at four
   different gasification temperatures from 750 to 900 degrees C and for
   different particle sizes (<90 mu m-925 mu m). The effects of
   temperature, particle size, and the char type on the rate of CO2
   gasification were determined. The 50\% conversion rate showed an
   increase in the reactivity values, along with an increase in the
   temperature, and decreased with an increase in the particle size for
   both the char types. The diffusional parameters such as effective
   diffusivity, effectiveness factor, and the DLI (diffusion limitation
   index) were calculated from the experimental data for both the char
   types. BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) analysis and SEM (Scanning Electron
   Microscopy) analysis were performed to determine the surface area and to
   study the structural morphology of the char types. Torrefied char had a
   greater surface area than the pyrolyzed char. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Various ions are of interest to the quality of biodiesel feedstock and
   products. In this study, a simple and labor-saving analytical method was
   developed to directly and simultaneously measure seven anions of
   interest in oil, utilizing an ion chromatography system with function of
   sample matrix elimination. Various eluent profiles were explored and
   calibration curves were made to analyze 13 raw Jatropha curcas oils for
   their contents of formate, acetate, nitrite, nitrate, sulfite, sulfate
   and phosphate. A 23 mm program was found to sufficiently separate all
   the ions, and linear correlation higher than 99\% was achieved for all
   the ions except formate (98.6\%). High diversity was found in both the
   presence and concentration range of these ions. Formate, nitrate, and
   phosphate were more prevalent among the ions tested, such that 12, 10,
   and 11 samples showed their presence, respectively. Nitrite was found in
   only two samples with the concentrations lower than 10 mg kg(-1).
   Formate concentration ranged from 0 to over 3000 mg kg(-1), and nitrate
   and phosphate showed ranges of 0 to 100 and 0 to 300 mg kg(-1),
   respectively. Acetate was less common than formate, and its
   concentration was universally lower (0 to 500 mg kg(-1)). In addition,
   the occurrence of acetate and nitrite seemed to be correlated to that of
   formate and nitrate, respectively, whereas sulfite and sulfate showed
   mutual exclusion. This method showed reasonably good detection limits
   and reproducibility, that concentrations of around 0.2 mg L-1 can be
   detected in the organic samples, and in most cases the ratio of standard
   deviation to average was below 25\%. However, for phosphate, the
   accuracy and reproducibility need further improvement, possibly by
   decreasing sample dilution ratio and optimizing eluent profile.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents measurements and a propagation model for an indoor
   wireless LAN (WLAN) scenario that represents an open concept office or
   laboratory layout with few large obstacles to reflect and refract the
   transmitted signal. Most mobile WLAN users generally restrict their
   movements to a small area due to the inability of most WLANs to
   accommodate hand-offs. As a result, users travel through at most one or
   two scattering clusters and experience only one or two discrete
   shadowing values. Hence, this paper will use propagation measurements
   collected over bandwidths of 10 MHz, to develop a statistical model for
   shadowing suitable for such an indoor WLAN scenario. Moreover, in indoor
   environments shadowing varies quickly enough to require some channel
   estimation algorithms to account for both small scale and large scale
   statistics. Therefore, this paper will present a distribution that
   jointly models variations due to both Rician fading and the new
   shadowing model. An analytical expression for the probability density
   function (PDF) of the joint distribution will be derived and fit to the
   experimental propagation data.}},

Abstract = {{Fast inversion in finite fields is crucial for high-performance
   cryptography and codes. We present techniques to exploit the recently
   proposed hybrid-double multipliers for fast inversions in binary fields
   GF(2(m)) with normal bases. A hybrid-double multiplier computes a double
   multiplication, the product of three elements in GF(2(m)) , with a
   latency comparable to the latency of single multiplication of two
   elements. Traditional approaches, such as Itoh-Tsujii, cannot utilize
   hybrid-double multipliers. We devise a new inversion algorithm based on
   ternary representations that exploits their potential. The algorithm
   reduces the latency of inversion significantly for the fields
   recommended by NIST if hybrid-double multipliers are employed. For
   example, the algorithm computes an inversion in GF(2(163)) with only
   five double multiplications whereas the Itoh-Tsujii algorithm requires
   nine single or double multiplications. We propose a new inverter
   architecture using this new algorithm and a hybrid-double multiplier. We
   show that it is faster than the existing techniques by providing ASIC
   synthesis results using 65-nm CMOS technology. For example, our inverter
   for GF(2(163)) achieves about 34 percent shorter computation time than
   an inverter using the Itoh-Tsujii algorithm and a single multiplier.}},

Volume = {{41}},

Abstract = {{Compressing project schedule using activity accelerating and overlapping
   requires that an intensive time-cost trade-off analysis be carried out,
   to determine costs and benefits for each day of compression. However,
   the cost elements and implications of compression techniques differ
   significantly, since activity accelerating imposes extra direct cost
   whereas activity overlapping adds a risk of changes and rework. Such a
   trade-off becomes even more complicated in capital projects comprised of
   a large number of schedule activities and relationships. The variety of
   combinations of accelerating and overlapping of different activities in
   these complex networks can offer numerous possibilities for compression
   with various costs and potential risks. The lack of a reliable
   analytical tool for performing a precise cost-benefit analysis causes
   this critical task to be performed in a subjective manner during the
   planning stage of projects. The purpose of this paper is to present an
   advanced method using a multi-objective evolutionary optimization tool
   seeking the optimum degree of accelerating and overlapping during the
   schedule compression process. This optimization technique would be
   beneficial in maximizing project benefits while meeting the intended

Abstract = {{Pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have been used increasingly in
   research as primary material for various tissue-engineering
   applications. Pluripotency, or the ability to give rise to all cells of
   the body, is an important characteristic of ESCs. Traditional methods
   use leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) to maintain murine embryonic stem
   cell (mESC) pluripotency in static and bioreactor cultures. When LIF is
   removed from mESCs in static cultures, pluripotency genes are
   downregulated and the cultures will spontaneously differentiate.
   Recently we have shown the maintenance of pluripotency gene expression
   of mESCs in stirred suspension bioreactors during differentiation
   experiments in the absence of LIF. This is undesired in a
   differentiation experiment, where the goal is downregulation of
   pluripotency gene expression and upregulation of gene expression
   characteristic to the differentiation. Thus, the objective of this study
   was to examine how effectively different levels of shear stress {[}100
   rpm (6 dyne/cm(2)), 60 rpm (3 dyne/cm(2))] maintained and influenced
   pluripotency in suspension bioreactors. The pluripotency markers Oct-4,
   Nanog, Sox-2 and Rex-1 were assessed using gene expression profiles and
   flow-cytometry analysis and showed that shear stress does maintain and
   influence the gene expression of certain pluripotency markers. Some
   significant differences between the two levels of shear stress were seen
   and the combination of shear stress and LIF was observed to
   synergistically increase the expression of certain pluripotency markers.
   Overall, this study provides a better understanding of the environmental
   conditions within suspension bioreactors and how these conditions affect
   the pluripotency of mESCs. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The oversampling requirement in a delta-sigma modulator (DSM) is
   considered one of the limiting factors toward its employment in current
   high-frequency applications, such as wireless software defined radio
   (SDR) systems. This paper advances that the critical requirement for
   DSMs is high-frequency processing and not a high-oversampling ratio. A
   single-bit semiparallel processing structure to accomplish the
   high-frequency processing is proposed in this paper. Using the suggested
   low-oversampling digital DSM architecture, highspeed, high-complexity
   computations, which are normally required for wireless applications, are
   executed simultaneously. This facilitates the design of embedded SDR
   multistandard transmitters using commercially available digital
   processors. The most favorable application of the proposed single-bit
   DSM is to build an radio frequency transmitter that includes a one-bit
   quantifier with two-level switching power amplifier for both high
   linearity and high efficiency. Performance analysis is carried out by
   using MATLAB simulations, which shows a reduction of the oversampling
   ratio by a factor of 16 (for a baseline oversampling ratio of 256) with
   the same signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The proposed DSM is also
   implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) board and its
   performance is validated by using a code division multiple access
   signal. The bandwidth of the output signal is increased four times
   without increasing the processing frequency. Simultaneously, quality of
   the output signal remains the same but FPGA resource usage is increased
   by a factor of three.}},

Abstract = {{Decolourisation and decomposition of acid orange 7 as a model for

   amount of hydrogen peroxide was used in the reaction medium. The effects
   of several other parameters were also investigated. Reaction time as
   well as the initial amount of hydrogen peroxide showed great effect on
   the decolourisation and decomposition reactions. At the higher
   temperatures, it was found utilising UV/Vis scanning spectra that the
   dye decomposed into very small molecules and gaseous products;
   consequently, total organic carbon (TOC) amount of the solutions after
   subcritical water treatment significantly declined. The reactions
   carried out without formation of any solid materials. At the optimum
   conditions treatment of several different types of dyes were also
   investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Porous nanoparticles aggregated from primary zeolite sodium-form Y (NaY)
   nanocrystals were hydrothermally synthesised using porous precipitated
   silica as the silica source via a three-stage temperature control

   additive. The synthesised samples were characterised using powder X-ray
   diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, nitrogen (N-2)
   sorption, and particle size analysis. The results show that the zeolite
   aggregate particles with sizes of 150-600nm were composed of highly
   crystalline zeolite NaY nanoparticles in the size range of 2-4nm. The
   particle sizes of porous aggregates can be readily tuned by varying the
   additive amounts of the zeolite precursor gel without notably changing
   the sizes of the primary zeolite nanocrystals. The N-2 sorption results
   show that the zeolite NaY aggregate particles had high microporosity

Abstract = {{This paper presents a design approach to concurrent dual-band
   subsampling receivers for wireless certification and testing
   interoperability. The proposed technique allows the optimization of the
   signal-to-noise and distortion ratio and improves the subsampling
   receiver performance, usually limited by the clock jitter and folded
   thermal noise effects. Furthermore, the proposed design approach
   considers the presence of spurious nonlinear distortions and/ or
   interferer's signals, which can alias over the desired signal bandwidth
   and reduce the valid subsampling frequency ranges. The proposed
   architecture allows seamless reconfigurability for simultaneous
   multistandard signal reception, reducing the costs in test equipment. As
   a validation of the proposed design methodology, a dual-band multiple
   clocking subsampling receiver operating in a nonlinear environment is
   developed, and an algorithm to find the optimal frequency plan is
   proposed and validated experimentally.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we conduct a new statistical study on the temporal
   distribution of the Global Positioning System Total Electron Content
   (GPS TEC) anomalies prior to the earthquakes with magnitude Ma parts per
   thousand yen7.0 in the global area during 2003-2012 by the method of
   statistical analysis. The temporal distribution of the ionospheric TEC
   anomalies prior to the earthquakes with magnitude Ma parts per thousand
   yen7.0 is for the first time studied. It has been observed that the
   ionospheric negative anomalies mainly occur in one week prior to the
   earthquakes, and only when the magnitude is greater than or equal to
   7.6, the ionospheric anomalies will have the greatest probability of
   occurrence in the afternoon to sunset (i.e. between 12:00 and 18:00
   local time). They last for approximate 2 hr, but the chance of detecting
   the significant enhancement in the ionospheric TEC seems not to be a
   function of time and there is no clear tendency for positive anomalies.
   In addition, the relationship of the occurrence rate of pre-earthquake
   ionospheric anomalies and the magnitude of the earthquake is discussed,
   and it is found that the observed ionospheric TEC anomalies within
   several days before the earthquakes are highly likely to be related with
   the earthquakes because the occurrence rate of pre-earthquake
   ionospheric anomalies seems to increase slightly with the earthquake
   magnitude increasing.}},

Abstract = {{The potential of aerobic granular sludge in co-metabolic removal of
   recalcitrant substances was evaluated using trichloroethylene (TCE) as
   the model compound. Aerobic granules cultivated in a sequencing batch
   reactor with phenol as the growth substrate exhibited TCE and phenol
   degradation activities lower than previously reported values. Depletion
   of reducing energy and diffusion limitation within the granules were
   investigated as the possible rate limiting factors. Sodium formate and
   citrate were supplied to the granules in batch studies as external
   electron sources. No significant enhancing effect was observed on the
   instant TCE transformation rates, but 10 mM formate could improve the
   ultimate transformation capacity by 26 \%. Possible diffusion barrier
   was studied by sieving the biomass into five size fractions, and
   determining their specific TCE and phenol degradation rates and
   capacities. Biomass in the larger size fractions generally showed lower
   activities. Large granules of > 700 mu m diameter exhibited only 22 \%
   of the flocs' TCE transformation capacity and 35 \% of its phenol
   dependent SOUR, indicating the possible occurrence of diffusion
   limitation in larger biomass. However, the highest specific TCE
   transformation rate was observed with the fraction that mostly consisted
   of small granules (150-300 mu m), suggesting an optimal size range while
   applying aerobic granules in TCE co-metabolic removal.}},

Journal = {{CONNECTIVE TISSUE RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Clinical evidence suggests that synovium can add to adjacent articular
   cartilage damage, potentially contributing to the development of
   osteoarthritis (OA). Inflammation of the synovium (synovitis) is
   dependent on the type of injury sustained, the time after injury and
   concomitant changes in other joint tissues. To define the role of
   synovitis in OA development, there is a need for baseline measures that
   can reliably distinguish synovial inflammation from normal synovium both
   within and between joints. This study tested the hypothesis that normal
   synovium from distinct anatomical locations in young and adult sheep is
   homogeneous with respect to consistently low molecular expression of the
   inflammatory mediators - tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and
   interleukins (IL) such as IL-1 beta, IL-1Ra, IL-6 and IL-8.
   Additionally, maturation will not influence the expression of these
   select inflammatory biomarkers. Samples of synovium from four anatomic
   locations (medial and lateral margins, suprapatellar pouch (patella
   region), posterior to the posterior cruciate ligament, from each joint
   of 5 adult and 4 immature animals were graded histologically or analyzed
   for mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines. Histologically, no
   evidence of synovitis was noted although some variance in sub-intimal
   fibrosis was observed between sample locations in mature sheep.
   Molecular expression of all inflammatory mediators was low and
   homogeneously expressed at constitutive levels in all sample locations.
   These findings confirm the hypothesis that the normal sheep synovium is
   a homogeneous tissue throughout the joint and establishes the baseline
   expression levels for several pro-inflammatory mediators in both
   immature and mature sheep.}},

Abstract = {{With increasing concerns over the possibility of tornadoes in highly
   populated areas in Canada, emergency managers are looking into ways to
   mitigate the impacts of tornadoes. Given that tornadoes can cause
   enormous destruction, early warnings and proper evacuation actions are
   critically important in helping save lives. In this paper, a survey was
   conducted to analyse the evacuation behaviour of households and drivers
   during a hypothetical tornado warning situation in the city of Calgary,
   Alberta. Nearly 500 Calgarians took part in the online survey and
   provided information on how they would respond to tornado warnings after
   receiving them. This paper presents the results of the survey. Using
   probit models, the factors influencing these evacuation decisions are
   identified and discussed in detail. The results of the household
   evacuation model show the importance of improving awareness about the
   safest locations during a tornado. It further highlights the need for
   targeting the population under the age of 30, who are more likely to
   take unsafe evacuation actions. The model for evacuation of drivers
   shows that several factors, such as knowing the difference between a
   watch and a warning, awareness of safe cover, receipt of warnings
   through natural environmental cues and the level of education, trigger
   evacuation actions in avoiding a tornado threat.}},

Abstract = {{A beamforming system based on two-dimensional (2-D) spatially bandpass
   infinite impulse response (IIR) plane wave filtering is presented in a
   multi-dimensional signal processing perspective and the implementation
   details are discussed. Real-time implementation of such beamforming
   systems requires modeling of computational electromagnetics for the
   antennas, radio frequency (RF) analog design aspects for low-noise
   amplifiers (LNAs), mixed-signal aspects for signal quantization and
   sampling and finally, digital architectures for the spatially bandpass
   plane wave filters proposed in Joshi et al. (IEEE Trans Very Large Scale
   Integr Syst 20(12):2241-2254, 2012). Multi-dimensional spatio-temporal
   spectral properties of down-converted RF plane wave signals are reviewed
   and derivation of the spatially bandpass filter transfer function is
   presented. An example of a wideband antipodal Vivaldi antenna is
   simulated at 1 GHz. Potential RF receiver chains are identified
   including a design of a tunable combline microstrip bandpass filter with
   tuning range 0.8-1.1 GHz. The 1st-order sensitivity analysis of the beam
   filter 2-D -domain transfer function shows that for a 12-bits of
   fixed-point precision, the maximum percentage error in the 2-D magnitude
   frequency response due to quantization is as low as . Monte-Carlo
   simulations are used to study the effect of quantization on the bit
   error rate (BER) performance of the beamforming system. 5-bit analog to
   digital converter (ADC) precision with 8-bit internal arithmetic
   precision provides a gain of approximately 16 dB for a BER of with
   respect to the no beamforming case. ASIC Synthesis results of the beam
   filter in 45 nm CMOS verifies a real time operating frequency of 429
   MHz.}},

Abstract = {{Corticosteroids are used in musculoskeletal diseases, and offer patient
   relief. Injections of corticosteroids are recommended for management of
   osteoarthritis (OA). Current data have shown the role of corticosteroids
   in ameliorating pain. We hypothesized that repeated intra-articular
   injections of high dose dexamethasone would protect the cartilage from
   damage in a post-traumatic model of OA. Eighteen female New Zealand
   White rabbits were used. Twelve underwent surgery to induce OA; six of
   them received intra-articular injections of dexamethasone every 3 days
   for 3 weeks. The other six rabbits served as operated controls. Six
   additional rabbits served as non-operated controls. All animals were
   euthanized 3 weeks post-surgery. Knees were assessed grossly. Cartilage,
   synovium, and fat pad were assessed histologically. Synovium and fat pad
   were analyzed with qPCR and Western blots. Surgical controls had
   cartilage damage which was supressed with dexamethasone. Dexamethasone
   significantly decreased synovial expression of interleukin-1 and
   collagen I, and a trend to decrease synovial matrix metalloproteinase3
   expression. There were also significantly lower levels of interleukin-1
   protein with dexamethasone treatment. Dexamethasone significantly
   decreased fat pad expression of matrix metalloproteinase13, basic
   fibroblast growth factor, and interleukin8, and a trend to decrease
   matrix metalloproteinase3 and transforming growth factor expression.
   Dexamethasone decreased joint inflammation and joint tissue degradation
   and was chondroprotective in this unique model of PTOA. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{Cartilage lesions change the microenvironment of cells and may
   accelerate cartilage degradation through catabolic responses from
   chondrocytes. In this study, we investigated the effects of structural
   integrity of the extracellular matrix (ECM) on chondrocytes by comparing
   the mechanics of cells surrounded by an intact ECM with cells close to a
   cartilage lesion using experimental and numerical methods.
   Experimentally, 15\% nominal compression was applied to bovine cartilage
   tissues using a light-transmissible compression system. Target cells in
   the intact ECM and near lesions were imaged by dual-photon microscopy.
   Changes in cell morphology (N-cell=32 for both ECM conditions) were
   quantified. A two-scale (tissue level and cell level) Finite Element
   (FE) model was also developed. A 15\% nominal compression was applied to
   a non-linear, biphasic tissue model with the corresponding cell level
   models studied at different radial locations from the centre of the
   sample in the transient phase and at steady state. We studied the
   Green-Lagrange strains in the tissue and cells. Experimental and
   theoretical results indicated that cells near lesions deform less
   axially than chondrocytes in the intact ECM at steady state. However,
   cells near lesions experienced large tensile strains in the principal
   height direction, which are likely associated with non-uniform tissue
   radial bulging. Previous experiments showed that tensile strains of high
   magnitude cause an up-regulation of digestive enzyme gene expressions.
   Therefore, we propose that cartilage degradation near tissue lesions may
   be due to the large tensile strains in the principal height direction
   applied to cells, thus leading to an up-regulation of catabolic factors.

Abstract = {{The Reservoir-Wave Approach is an alternative, time-domain approach to
   arterial hemodynamics that is based on the assertion that measured
   pressure and flow can be resolved into their volume-related (i.e.,
   reservoir) and wave-related (i.e., excess) components. The change in
   reservoir pressure is assumed to be proportional to the difference
   between measured inflow and calculated outflow. Wave intensity analysis
   of the excess components yields a pattern of aortic wave propagation and
   reflection in the dog that is novel and physiologically plausible: waves
   are reflected positively from a site in the femoral circulation and
   negatively from a site below the diaphragm, where the total
   ``daughter-vessel{''} cross-sectional area exceeds the
   ``mother-vessel{''} area. With vasodilatation, the negative reflection
   is augmented and with vasoconstriction, it is virtually eliminated. On
   the other hand, conventional hemodynamic analysis has been shown to
   yield a paradoxical ``forward-going back-ward wave{''} and the impedance
   minimum, previously assumed to be an indicator of the source of wave
   reflection according to quarter-wave-length theory, has been shown to be
   due to the reservoir component. Clinical studies employing the
   Reservoir-Wave Approach should be undertaken to verify experimental
   observations and, perhaps, to gain new diagnostic and therapeutic
   insights. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Abstract = {{The effects of H2S and H2O in the methane feed on carbon deposition in a

   investigated in this work under different operating conditions.
   Characterization was done using a combination of electrochemical,
   Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR), temperature-programmed
   oxidation (TPO) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements.
   As expected, carbon accumulation became more severe with increasing
   exposure time and operating temperature, but less severe in the presence
   of a current and/or steam. Addition of 0.5\% H2S to the feed increased
   carbon accumulation and this carbon could not be removed effectively by
   co-feeding a small amount of steam to the anode. The resulting carbon
   was, however, easier to remove with oxygen as compared to that deposited
   by the H2S-containing dry feed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Application of tracer injection tests to characterize rock matrix block

Abstract = {{The complexity of mass transfer processes between the mobile and
   immobile zones in geohydrologic settings and the limitations that
   currently exist in the characterization of contaminated sites demand the
   development of improved models. In this work, we present a model that
   describes the mass transfer in structured porous media. This model
   considers divergent radial advective-dispersive transport in fractures
   and diffusive mass transfer inside rock matrix blocks. The heterogeneous
   nature of fractured formations is included with the integration of
   various distributions of rock matrix block sizes into the transport
   model. Breakthrough curves generated based on the developed model are
   analyzed to investigate the effects of the rate of injection,
   dispersivity and the immobile to mobile porosity ratio on mass transfer
   between mobile and immobile zones. It is shown that the developed model,
   in conjunction with tracer data collected from a monitoring well, can be
   used to estimate the dispersivity and fracture intensity. Results reveal
   that the dispersivity is independent of the rock matrix block size
   distribution for dispersion-dominant transport in fractures. These
   findings are used to develop a methodology to characterize rock matrix
   block size distribution in fractured aquifers and to estimate
   dispersivity based on a tracer test, which will improve our decisions
   concerning the remediation of contaminated sites. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{A novel generalised twin-box model is proposed for the mutual
   compensation of modulator imperfections and power amplifier (PA)
   distortion. It is composed of two cascaded boxes, a dual branch of
   simplified Volterra filters for the joint characterisation of the mild
   non-linear dynamic memory effects of the PA and modulator imperfections.
   The second box is a look-up table for characterising the highly
   non-linear static distortion exhibited by the PA. Hence, the proposed
   model has reduced complexity in comparison with the state-of-the-art
   models, owing to the separate identification of the dynamic and static
   effects of the PA. The model validation is carried out using a Class AB
   PA, and the proposed model showed significant improvement in performance
   as well as reducing the computational complexity of the model.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(vinylidene) fluoride (PVDF) nanocomposite samples were prepared by
   incorporation of carbon nanotubes (CNT) and nanoclay into PVDF using a
   twin screw extruder. Carbon nanotube was added to improve electrical
   conductivity and nanoclay was included to enhance beta crystal formation
   for piezoelectric property. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results showed that
   partial melt intercalation of PVDF in clay was achieved. The XRD results
   also revealed that CNT and nanocaly addition increased beta phase
   crystal amount in PVDF. FTIR spectroscopy measurements confirmed the XRD
   results and showed that the effect of nanoclay on beta phase crystal
   formation of PVDF was more prominent than CNT. It was found that shear
   rate applied during crystallization would improve b phase crystal
   formation but only for the neat PVDF. Electrical conductivity results
   showed that addition of CNT improved conductivity as a percolation of 2
   wt.\% was observed. It was found that dispersion of CNT into PVDF matrix
   is very crucial for obtaining a higher conductivity. The results showed
   that clay incorporation into CNT nanocomposite improved electrical
   conductivity. The TEM micrographs showed bundles of CNT were adhered to
   clay particles. That was considered an indication of affinity between
   CNT and organically modified clay. The results of compounding of CNT and
   nanoclay with PVDF in batch mixer also revealed improvement in
   electrical conductivity when clay was added into PVDF/CNT composite in
   melt state. The conductivity improved with mixing time for both systems:
   PVDF/CNT and PVDF/CNT/nanocaly.}},

Title = {{A method for assessing joint line shift post knee arthroplasty
   considering the preoperative joint space}},
Journal = {{KNEE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{359-363}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background: Accurate comparison of outcomes regarding various surgical
   options in knee arthroplasty can benefit from an improved method for
   joint line analysis that takes into account the preoperative joint
   space.
   Methods: This article describes a new preoperative-based registration
   method that measures changes in the joint line by overlaying the 3D
   models of the bones with implants using preoperative CT along with
   preoperative and postoperative biplanar radiography. The method was
   tested on six cadaveric specimens for measuring alteration to the medial
   and lateral joint lines in extension and flexion.
   Results: The joint line shift, when measured using the new method, was
   in the range of -0.2 to 1.3 mm on average (SD = 1.3 to 3.8 mm, for
   medial and lateral, in flexion and extension positions). This was
   significantly different (p <= 0.01) from the results of a previous
   postoperative-based registration method which did not account for the
   cartilage thickness in calculating alterations of the joint line (mean =
   3.9 to 6.8 mm, SD = 1.2 to 4.3 mm).
   Conclusion: These results further highlight the importance of
   considering the preoperative joint space in analyzing the joint line,
   and demonstrate the utility of the newly introduced method for accurate
   assessment of changes in the joint line after arthroplasty.
   Clinical relevance: The introduced method provides accurate means for
   investigating joint line alterations in relation to different surgical
   techniques and the subsequent biomechanical effects after knee
   arthroplasty Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All

   A case study in Iran}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{126}},
Pages = {{1-10}},

Abstract = {{The influence of the air density variation with altitude on the
   performance of a small horizontal axis wind turbine blade was studied
   for four regions of good wind resources in Iran and altitudes up to 3000
   m. In order to improve the performance of the turbine at low wind speed,
   starting time was combined with output power in an objective function
   and a three-bladed, 2 m diameter rotor was designed and optimized for
   those regions using a purpose-built genetic algorithm. The Blade-Element
   Momentum (BEM) theory was employed to calculate the output power and a
   modified version was used to determine the starting time in the presence
   of a small, but significant resistive torque. The optimization procedure
   maximized a combination of the output power in terms of the power
   coefficient and the starting time. Results show that the performance of
   a blade optimized for sea level degrades for other locations and that
   degradation is more important for the starting performance than the
   power coefficient. In order to improve the performance of the blade at
   the different altitudes, the optimization process was performed in two
   steps. First, the geometry of the blade was optimized for the air
   density at the appropriate altitude that increased both the power
   coefficient and the starting time. Much more power was achieved using
   the second step in which the tip speed ratio was optimized along with
   the geometry of the blade in the optimization procedure. The results
   highlight the importance of the drive train and generator resistive
   torque which delays the starting of the wind turbine especially at very
   high altitudes as the aerodynamic torque is reduced. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Rice is one of the staple foods across the world, thus information about
   its production is essential for ensuring food security. Here, our
   objective was to develop a method for mapping ``boro{''} rice (i.e.,
   cultivated during the months January to May) in a Bangladeshi context.
   In this paper, we used a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
   (MODIS)-derived 16-day composite of normalized difference vegetation
   index (NDVI) at 250 m spatial resolution in conjunction with ancillary
   datasets (i.e., land use map, crop calendar, and ground-based rice
   production information) during the period 2007-2012. The proposed method
   consisted of three procedures: (i) ISODATA clustering and determining
   the boro rice signatures in temporal dimension using data from the
   period 2007-2009; (ii) formulating a mathematical model for extracting
   the boro rice areas using data from the period 2007-2009; and (iii)
   model calibration using data from the period 2007-2009 and its
   validation using data from the period 2010-2012. The implementation of
   the abovementioned procedures revealed reasonable agreements between the
   model (i.e., MODIS-based) and ground-based estimates of boro rice area
   at both country (i.e., percentage error in the range -0.83-1.42\%) and
   district levels (i.e., r(2) in the range 0.69-0.89) during the period
   2010-2012. Our proposed method demonstrated its effectiveness in mapping
   rice system at the regional/country scale.}},

   of a regular packing. When the analysis is extended to a random packing,
   one can explicitly incorporate the dependence of fabric, density and
   stress level on dilatancy, a basic aspect of geomaterial behaviour. The
   resulting microstructurally based stress dilatancy relation can be
   easily implemented as a non-associated flow rule in any standard
   elastoplastic model. Some numerical simulations of stress-dilatancy with
   initial fabric as a controlling variable are presented to illustrate the
   developed model. (c) 2014 Academie des sciences. Published by Elsevier

Title = {{Measurement of gas storage processes in shale and of the molecular

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{123}},

Abstract = {{Total gas storage capacity in many shale gas reservoirs arises from
   three sources: compressed gas in the micro-and nano-scale pores,
   adsorbed gas on the inner surfaces of pores in kerogen-the main
   constituent of organic materials in shale-and dissolved gas molecules in
   kerogen. The storage capacity of and transport processes for each of
   these three sources of gas are different, and accordingly, appropriate
   models and production strategies should be developed on the basis of
   actual physics. Of great relevance to field development and management
   is knowing the contribution of each source to daily production and
   ultimate gas recovery. A valuable body of literature has addressed the
   first two sources, but the last source has not been studied in detail.
   We developed a technique to measure the gas capacity from each of the
   above-mentioned three sources simultaneously, in a small piece of a
   shale sample, through batch pressure decay experiments. Temporal
   pressure decay is recorded using a quartz high-resolution pressure
   transducer for several days. The pressure-decline curve shows
   distinctive slope changes representing different storage processes.
   Pressure decline at the earliest time represents gas migration into the
   micro- and nano-pores. This is followed by a change in the slope of the
   pressure decline in an intermediate time, representing gas adsorption
   onto the inner surface of kerogen pores. At the later time, the slope of
   the pressure decline changes again, representing gas diffusion into
   kerogen. In the samples we tested, we found that dissolved gas in
   kerogen can contribute about 22\% of the total gas-in-place. Assuming
   that gas molecules diffuse into the walls of the pores in kerogen, we
   used a Fickian diffusion model and a parameterestimation technique to
   estimate the gas molecular diffusion coefficient in kerogen. We measured
   the diffusion coefficient of methane in amorphous kerogen as being on
   the order of 10(-20)m(2)/s. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs) have
   potential clinical utility in the treatment of a multitude of ailments
   and diseases, due to their relative ease of isolation from patients and
   their capacity to form many cell types. However, hBM-MSCs are sparse,
   and can only be isolated in very small quantities, thereby hindering the
   development of clinical therapies. The use of microcarrier-based stirred
   suspension bioreactors to expand stem cell populations offers an
   approach to overcome this problem. Starting with standard culture
   protocols commonly reported in the literature, we have successfully
   developed new protocols that allow for improved expansion of hBM-MSCs in
   stirred suspension bioreactors using CultiSpher-S microcarriers. Cell
   attachment was facilitated by using intermittent bioreactor agitation,
   removing fetal bovine serum, modifying the stirring speed and
   manipulating the medium pH. By manipulating these parameters, we
   enhanced the cell attachment efficiency in the first 8 h
   post-inoculation from 18\% (standard protocol) to 72\% (improved
   protocol). Following microcarrier attachment, agitation rate was found
   to impact cell growth kinetics, whereas feeding had no significant
   effect. By serially subculturing hBM-MSCs using the new suspension
   bioreactor protocols, we managed to obtain cell fold increases of 10(3)
   within 30 days, which was superior to the 200-fold increase obtained
   using the standard protocol. The cells were found to retain their
   defining characteristics after several passages in suspension. This new
   bioprocess represents a more efficient approach for generating large
   numbers of hBM-MSCs in culture, which in turn should facilitate the
   development of new stem cell-based therapies. Copyright (c) 2012 John

Abstract = {{Objective: The impact of dietary-induced obesity (DIO) on stem cell
   engraftment and the respective therapeutic potential of stem cell
   engraftment in DIO have not been reported. The objectives of this study
   were to examine the impact of DIO on the survival and efficacy of
   intravenous bone marrow- derived mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)
   administration in the conscious C57BL/6 mouse.
   Methods: Male mice consumed either a chow (CH) or high fat (HF, 60\%
   kcal) diet for 18 weeks and were subsequently treated with MSC over a
   6-day period. Key measurements included tissue-specific cell
   engraftment, glucose and insulin sensitivity, inflammation, and
   oxidative stress.
   Results: MSC administration had no effect on inflammatory markers,
   glucose, or insulin sensitivity. DIO mice showed increases in MSC
   engraftment in multiple tissues compared with their CH counterparts.
   Engraftment was increased in the HF liver where MSC administration
   attenuated DIO-induced oxidative stress. These liver-specific
   alterations in HF-MSC were associated with increases in stanniocalcin-1
   (STC1) and uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), which contribute to cell
   survival and modulate mitochondrial bioenergetics.
   Conclusion: Results suggest that MSC administration in DIO promotes
   engraftment and mitigates hepatic oxidative stress. These data invite
   further exploration into the therapeutic potential of stem cells for the
   treatment of DIO oxidative stress in the liver.}},

Abstract = {{Soil profiles from 0 to 90cm depth were collected to investigate
   temporal dynamics and profile variations in soil urease activities in
   Carex meyeriana wetland and to capture the direct and indirect effects
   of soil nutrients on soil urease activities in the Changbai Mountain
   valley wetland of China during the periods from 2002 to 2003. Our
   results showed that soil urease activities decreased gradually with
   increasing depth along soil profiles with higher coefficients of
   variation in the upper soils, which were positively correlated with
   microorganism numbers. Soil urease activities during the growing season
   from May to September were higher than those in April. Path analysis
   showed that both NO3--N and dissolved Mg (DMg) had direct positive
   effects on soil urease activities and they had the highest direct path
   coefficients and determination coefficients compared to other soil
   nutrients. Total contents of Cu and Fe showed direct and indirect
   positive effects on soil urease activities through NO3--N, whereas they
   showed negative indirect effects through DMg. Despite that total Mg and
   dissolved K showed direct adverse effects on soil urease activities, the
   indirect effects through NO3--N were much higher. In contrast, total Zn
   showed both direct and indirect adverse effects on this enzyme. However,
   the positive indirect effects of soil organic matter, total N, and total
   P on soil urease activities were more significant than their direct
   effects. The findings of this work had a potential important role in
   monitoring soil biological quality in N-limited mountain valley wetland

Abstract = {{Integer ambiguity resolution is able to improve positioning accuracy and
   reduce convergence time in Precise Point Positioning (PPP). Although
   significantly improved horizontal positioning accuracy has been
   demonstrated, the height solution improvement is found to be less
   significant, and improving this requires further investigation. In this
   paper, a troposphere constraint method using precise troposphere
   corrections is proposed to improve the PPP ambiguity-resolved height
   solution. This is different from the conventional approach that
   typically applies meteorological data to calculate the a priori
   troposphere delay and estimates the residual troposphere delay. The
   effects of the troposphere delay on PPP ambiguity-resolved height
   solutions are first studied. Numerical analysis is conducted to
   ambiguity-resolved positioning results based on the decoupled clock
   model and hourly Global Positioning System (GPS) observations from a
   Canadian PPP-inferred troposphere precipitable water vapour system. The
   results show that by using the proposed method the PPP
   ambiguity-resolved height accuracy can be further improved to 3 center
   dot 86cm compared to 5 center dot 32cm using the conventional approach.}},

Abstract = {{Solar photovoltaic (PV) is a rapidly growing electricity generation
   technology. The increasing penetration of this technology is facilitated
   by incentives and public policy support that are being offered by
   various jurisdictions. There are various options for installing
   photovoltaic systems, rooftop and ground mounted systems being the two
   common options. The choice between these options has been complicated by
   the tradeoffs between cost and land use impacts. In this paper we
   develop a framework that can be used to highlight and quantify the
   tradeoffs between costs and land using life cycle costs (LCC), life
   cycle land use footprints (LUF), and consequent land use impacts (LUI)
   across various options of implementing PV systems. We demonstrate the
   application of the framework using a hypothetical case study of
   implementing various options of PV systems in California. The results
   indicate that at 14.2 c/kWh, the utility-scale ground mounted option has
   the lowest LCC compared to residential and commercial rooftop mounted
   options. However, the utility-scale option has the highest land use
   footprint and land use impacts. The monitory value of the land use
   impacts from implementing utility scale ground mounted systems depends
   primarily on the type of associated ecosystems and the value people
   place on them. For the rooftop option in this case study to be preferred
   to the ground mounted option, the value of land use impacts would have
   to increase significantly. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{17}},
Pages = {{67-78}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Anthropogenic disturbances contribute to an animal's perception of and
   responses to the predation risk of its environment. Because an animal
   rarely encounters threatening stimuli in isolation, multiple
   disturbances can act in non-independent ways to shape an animal's
   landscape of fear, making it challenging to isolate their effects for
   effective and targeted management. We present extensions to an existing
   behavioral agent-based model (ABM) to use as an inverse modeling
   approach to test, in a scenario-sensitivity analysis, whether threatened
   Alberta boreal caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) differentially
   respond to industrial features (linear features, forest cutblocks,
   wellsites) and their attributes: presence, density, harvest age, and
   wellsite activity status. The spatially explicit ABM encapsulates
   predation risk, heterogeneous resource distribution, and
   species-specific energetic requirements, and successfully recreates the
   general behavioral mechanisms driving habitat selection. To create
   various industry-driven, predation-risk landscape scenarios for the
   sensitivity analysis, we allowed caribou agents to differentially
   perceive and respond to industrial features and their attributes. To
   identify which industry had the greatest relative influence on caribou
   habitat use and spatial distribution, simulated caribou movement
   patterns from each of the scenarios were compared with those of actual
   caribou from the study area, using a pattern-oriented, multi-response
   optimization approach. Results revealed caribou have incorporated
   forestry- and oil and gas features into their landscape of fear that
   distinctly affect their spatial and energetic responses. The presence of
   roads, pipelines and seismic lines, and, to a minor extent, high-density
   cutblocks and active wellsites, all contributed to explaining caribou
   behavioral responses. Our findings also indicated that both industries
   produced interaction effects, jointly impacting caribou spatial and
   energetic patterns, as no one feature could adequately explain
   anti-predator movement responses. We demonstrate that behavior-based
   ABMs can be applied to understanding, assessing, and isolating
   non-consumptive anthropogenic impacts, in support of wildlife
   management. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the oil drilling process, measurement-while-drilling system is
   usually used to provide real-time monitoring of the position and
   orientation of the bottom hole. Usually the bottom drill string attitude
   is measured on the condition that the drill string is static.
   Particularly, in rotary steerable drilling application, it is a
   challenging problem to accurately measure the spatial attitude
   (inclination, azimuth, and tool face) of the bottom drilling tool with
   the drill string rotating. A set of ``strap-down{''} measurement system
   was developed in this paper, the triaxial accelerometer and triaxial
   fluxgate were installed near the bit, and real-time well deviation and
   azimuth can been measured. Laboratory experiments show that the dynamic
   solver methods will meet the project requirements. However, according to
   the drilling field tests, playback analysis on storage data of the
   underground measurement indicates that drill string vibration is the
   main reason for measurement errors. So, by setting a time window, the
   real-time measurement of the accelerometer and the flux gate signal are
   processed and analyzed, the movement patterns of the rotary drilling
   tool at the bottom were judged within the time window. Stick-slip
   phenomenon is utilized to improve the measurement accuracy and to reduce
   the impact of lateral vibration of the drilling string on the
   measurement system. We could take advantage of stick-slip phenomenon
   because of it cannot be avoided completely, although it should be
   avoided in order to improve the drilling string operating life.
   Simulation results showed that recommended dynamic survey approach could
   effectively enhance measurement precision, and deduce effect of
   vibration on resolve results.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most effective ways to tune the physical and Chemical
   properties of CNTs is to dope them with a foreign element, such as
   nitrogen. Nitrogen atoms that are incorporated into the CNT structure
   can drastically change the properties of CNTs. The properties of
   nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) originate from their structure;
   thus, it is practical to create a desired structure during synthesis. We
   have investigated the effects of synthesis parameters, mainly
   temperature, on various characterizations of N-CNTs, such as their
   morphologies, dimensions (diameter and length), defects, nitrogen
   inclusions and thermal stability. The results revealed strong
   correlations between the synthesis parameters and the properties of the
   synthesized N-CNTs. XPS characterization indicated that the percentage
   of nitrogen inclusion decreased with increasing synthesis temperature up
   to 850 degrees C and then increased at 950 degrees C. Raman spectroscopy
   showed a decrease in the number of defects in the N-CNT structure with
   increasing synthesis temperature. Finally TGA demonstrated a trend of
   increasing thermal stability of N-CNTs with increasing synthesis
   temperature, up to 850 degrees C then a reduced thermal stability at 950
   degrees C. Based on these results, one can control the properties of
   N-CNTs and obtain materials with the desired characteristics by choosing
   the appropriate synthesis conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   processes and transportation. In this work, we used the
   Krichevsky-Ilinskaya equation to predict the solubility of light
   solvents (CH4, C2H6, CO2, N-2 and CO) in bitumen from five reservoirs in
   Alberta, Canada. The Peng-Robinson (PR) equation of state (EoS) is used
   to treat the gas phase. The proposed model is then verified using
   available experimental solubility data of light solvents in bitumen, and
   good agreement is observed. The experimental data cover wide ranges of
   pressures and temperatures. The results show that the proposed model
   represents the available solubility data of light hydrocarbons (CH4 and
   C2H6) and non-hydrocarbon solvents (CO2, N-2 and CO) in bitumen with
   absolute average relative deviations of <4.2\% and 5.4\%, respectively.
   These results can be applied to heavy oil and bitumen recovery
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{Having a reliable estimate of gaseous-solvents molecular diffusion
   coefficients in heavy oil and bitumen is a requisite for analysis and
   design of gas injection and solvent-based recovery techniques.
   Nevertheless, diffusion coefficient is not measured accurately unless
   all other contributing mass transfer parameters are considered, included
   in the modeling, and estimated correctly. These other parameters are gas
   solubility and interface resistance, of which the latter is represented
   by mass transfer coefficient term. In this work, an analytical model is
   introduced in conjunction with an inverse technique to obtain these
   three abovementioned parameters using a single pressure decay data set.
   Sensitivity coefficient analysis is applied as an additional practical
   evaluation tool to display the sensitivity of the measured pressure to
   each of the unknown parameters. Characterization of the interface
   resistance as a physical phenomenon which hinders the molecular
   diffusion of gas through the interface and complicates the modeling is
   further investigated in this work. Incipient asphaltene precipitation in
   heptane-toluene-asphaltene mixture was chosen as a potential phenomenon
   which alters the interfacial resistance. It is shown that our proposed
   inverse analysis locates the unknown parameters correctly when history
   matching per se is not disclosing all the sufficient information for
   accurate parameter estimation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Lower-back injury from snow shovelling may be related to excessive joint
   loading. Bent-shaft snow shovels are commonly available for purchase;
   however, their influence on lower back-joint loading is currently not
   known. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare L5/S1
   extension angular impulses between a bent-shaft and a standard
   straight-shaft snow shovel. Eight healthy subjects participated in this
   study. Each completed a simulated snow-lifting task in a biomechanics
   laboratory with each shovel design. A standard motion analysis procedure
   was used to determine L5/S1 angular impulses during each trial, as well
   as peak L5/S1 extension moments and peak upper body flexion angle.
   Paired-samples t-tests (alpha = 0.05) were used to compare variables
   between shovel designs. Correlation was used to determine the
   relationship between peak flexion and peak moments. Results of this
   study show that the bent-shaft snow shovel reduced L5/S1 extension
   angular impulses by 16.5\% (p = 0.022), decreased peak moments by 11.8\%
   (p = 0.044), and peak flexion by 13.0\% (p = 0.002) compared to the
   straight-shaft shovel. Peak L5/S1 extension moment magnitude was
   correlated with peak upper body flexion angle (r, = 0.70). Based on
   these results, it is concluded that the bent-shaft snow shovel can
   likely reduce lower-back joint loading during snow shovelling, and thus
   may have a role in snow shovelling injury prevention. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {{Dantrolene Improves Survival After Ventricular Fibrillation by
   Mitigating Impaired Calcium Handling in Animal Models}},
Journal = {{CIRCULATION}},
Year = {{2014}},

Pages = {{875-885}},
Month = {{FEB 25}},
Abstract = {{Background Resistant ventricular fibrillation, refibrillation. and
   diminished myocardial contractility are important factors leading to
   poor survival after cardiac arrest. We hypothesized that dantrolene
   improves survival after ventricular fibrillation (VF) by rectifying the
   calcium dysregulation caused by VF.
   Methods and Results VF was induced in 26 Yorkshire pigs for 4 minutes.
   Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was then commenced for 3 minutes, and
   dantrolene or isotonic saline was infused at the onset of
   cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Animals were defibrillated and observed
   for 30 minutes. To study the effect of VF on calcium handling and its
   modulation by dantrolene, hearts from 14 New Zealand rabbits were
   Langendorff-perfused. The inducibility of VF after dantrolene
   administration was documented. Optical mapping was performed to evaluate
   diastolic spontaneous calcium elevations as a measure of cytosolic
   calcium leak. The sustained return of spontaneous circulation (systolic
   blood pressure 60 mm Hg) was achieved in 85\% of the dantrolene group in
   comparison with 39\% of controls (P=0.02). return of spontaneous
   circulation was achieved earlier in dantrolene-treated pigs after
   successful defibrillation (216 s versus 181 +/- 57 s in controls,
   P=0.005). The median number of refibrillation episodes was lower in the
   dantrolene group (0 versus 1, P=0.04). In isolated rabbit hearts, the
   successful induction of VF was achieved in 83\% of attempts in controls
   versus 41\% in dantrolene-treated hearts (P=0.007). VF caused diastolic
   calcium leaks in the form of spontaneous calcium elevations.
   Administration of 20 mol/L dantrolene significantly decreased
   spontaneous calcium elevation amplitude versus controls. (0.024 +/-
   0.013 versus 0.12 +/- 0.02 arbitrary unit {[}200-ms cycle length],
   P=0.001).
   Conclusions Dantrolene infusion during cardiopulmonary resuscitation
   facilitates successful defibrillation, improves hemodynamics
   postdefibrillation, decreases refibrillation, and thus improves survival
   after cardiac arrest. The effects are mediated through normalizing
   VF-induced dysfunctional calcium cycling.}},

Abstract = {{A simple procedure is proposed to evaluate the uncertainty on binary
   interaction parameters propagated from the uncertainties present in the
   physical properties and equation parameters applied for their
   calculation using a simple cubic equation of state. A useful database
   containing 87 binary mixtures present in natural gas processing was
   constructed through critical collection of available experimental
   vapour-liquid equilibrium (VLE) data and their associated uncertainties.
   A thermodynamic consistency test was performed on each isothermal
   dataset to investigate the quality of the associated VLE data. Upon
   acceptance of the VLE data based on its quality and consistency, binary
   interaction parameters and associated uncertainties were determined
   using a combination of nonlinear regression and Monte Carlo simulation,
   taking into consideration the uncertainties of pure components, equation
   of state parameters, and VLE data. The Monte Carlo simulation was also
   used for the error propagation to estimate the uncertainty on the
   calculated VLE. Sample calculations were presented illustrating the
   effect of uncertainties on the PXY and TXY diagrams of ethane/propane
   and methane/hydrogen sulfide binary mixtures. The required minimum
   number of stages for a simplified de-ethanizer was calculated taking
   into account uncertainties of basic input parameters. In addition the
   effect of uncertainties on the position of calculated cricondenbar and
   cricondentherm was investigated. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},

Volume = {{259}},
Pages = {{474-489}},

Abstract = {{Decision support systems (DSSs) perform complex computations to provide
   suggestions regarding decision-making and problem solving. Quite often,
   the DSS solutions are not fully accepted by users because DSSs work as a
   black box so that the users cannot fully understand where the results
   came from and how they were derived. Explanations of the generated DSSs
   solutions are expected to mitigate this situation.
   In this paper, two machine-learning techniques, called rough set
   analysis (RSA) and dependency network analysis (DNA), are proposed for
   mining DSS solutions. The mining results are provided to the users as
   explanations for those solutions. Two parts of research results are
   described. First, a framework applying RSA and DNA for generating
   explanations for DSS solutions is presented. This framework is generic
   and applicable to many other DSSs. Second, as a proof-of-concept, the
   applications of RSA and DNA techniques are demonstrated through a case
   study of mining patterns from input-output pairs of ReleasePlanner (TM),
   a specific DSS for product release planning. Our evaluation indicates
   that the explanations generated by RSA and DNA improve the overall user
   acceptance of results provided by this specific DSS. (C) 2009 Elsevier

   feedback controller designed with appropriate pole placement. The
   discrete-time control first uses purely constant torques during stance
   and flight phase, then discretizes each phase into smaller
   constant-torque intervals. The other controller is an invariant manifold
   based chaos controller: a generalized Ott, Grebogi and Yorke controller
   having a linear form and a nonlinear form. Both controllers can
   stabilize active running gaits on either even or sloped terrains. The
   efficiency of these controllers for bipedal running applications are

   oil field is carried out by performing decline curve analysis to see
   whether conventional decline models developed for vertical wells are
   also suitable for horizontal wells. Results demonstrated that
   Blasingame's radial model yields best results for permeability and skin
   while material balance analysis estimates best values for oil in place
   and drainage area. Also, it demonstrates power and simplicity of these
   methods in the absence of well test data.}},

Title = {{The Role of Purkinje-Myocardial Coupling during Ventricular Arrhythmia:
   A Modeling Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 7}},
Abstract = {{The Purkinje system is the fast conduction network of the heart which
   couples to the myocardium at discrete sites called Purkinje-Myocyte
   Junctions (PMJs). However, the distribution and number of PMJs remains
   elusive, as does whether a particular PMJ is functional. We hypothesized
   that the Purkinje system plays a role during reentry and that the number
   of functional PMJs affect reentry dynamics. We used a computer finite
   element model of rabbit ventricles in which we varied the number of
   PMJs. Sustained, complex reentry was induced by applying an electric
   shock and the role of the Purkinje system in maintaining the arrhythmia
   was assessed by analyzing phase singularities, frequency of activation,
   and bidirectional propagation at PMJs. For larger junctional
   resistances, increasing PMJ density increased the mean firing rate in
   the Purkinje system, the percentage of successful retrograde conduction
   at PMJs, and the incidence of wave break on the epicardium. However, the
   mean firing of the ventricles was not affected. Furthermore, increasing
   PMJ density above 13/cm(2) did not alter reentry dynamics. For lower
   junctional resistances, the trend was not as clear. We conclude that
   Purkinje system topology affects reentry dynamics and conditions which
   alter PMJ density can alter reentry dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{The use of condensing solvents, especially propane vapor, has been
   proposed for the low-temperature recovery of bitumen by gravity
   drainage. A full numerical analysis of such a process is presented. A
   hybrid spectral/finite-difference method was implemented to solve
   equations simultaneously. The results show that the hydrodynamics of a
   miscible front was highly dependent on the characteristics of the porous
   medium and also on the properties of the miscible fluid. As a
   significant factor, the dependency of the production flow rate on the
   thickness of the porous medium was measured. The order of dependency was
   found to be a function of time and cannot be considered as a constant.
   Hydrodynamic dispersion was also found to decrease this dependency.
   More-detailed results, along with quantitative analyses, are also
   discussed to indicate how the hydrodynamics was influenced by other
   porous-medium characteristics and fluid properties, such as dissolution
   rate and molecular diffusion.}},

Journal = {{SPE RESERVOIR EVALUATION \& ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{98-104}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Rate- and pressure-transient analysis of unconventional gas and oil
   reservoirs is a challenge because of the complex reservoir
   characteristics that dictate flow. Transient linear flow is usually an
   important flow regime for these reservoirs and is often associated with
   linear flow to induced hydraulic fractures. One of the complications in
   the analysis of this flow regime is stress sensitivity of porosity and
   permeability. This work provides a new method for analysis of transient
   linear flow in stress-sensitive tight oil reservoirs.
   A correction factor is used to correct the results of the conventional
   method for analysis of transient linear flow in tight oil reservoirs. A
   new method is developed for calculating the correction factor by use of
   an analytical solution to the flow equation. The correction factor is
   used for production-data analysis of two examples for constant-pressure
   and constant-rate production. The results indicate that the correction
   factor becomes more important for higher values of permeability modulus
   and pressure drawdown. Further, we demonstrate that the correction
   factor can eliminate the considerable error of the conventional analysis
   method in estimating initial reservoir permeability or hydraulic
   fracture half-length.}},

Abstract = {{The Microsoft Kinect is arguably the most popular RGB-D camera currently
   on the market, partially due to its low cost. It offers many advantages
   for the measurement of dynamic phenomena since it can directly measure
   three-dimensional coordinates of objects at video frame rate using a
   single sensor. This paper presents the results of an investigation into
   the development of a Microsoft Kinect-based system for measuring the
   deflection of reinforced concrete beams subjected to cyclic loads. New
   segmentation methods for object extraction from the Kinect's depth
   imagery and vertical displacement reconstruction algorithms have been
   developed and implemented to reconstruct the time-dependent displacement
   of concrete beams tested in laboratory conditions. The results
   demonstrate that the amplitude and frequency of the vertical
   displacements can be reconstructed with submillimetre and milliHz-level
   precision and accuracy, respectively.}},

Title = {{Model of Trade-Off between Overlapping and Rework of Design Activities}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{An effective and well-known technique for earlier completion of
   construction projects is to overlap the project activities that normally
   would be performed in sequence. Overlapping, often called fast-tracking,
   is inherently risky because it increases uncertainties and can result in
   more changes and rework. In order to gain maximum advantages from early
   project completion, a trade-off between benefits and losses of activity
   overlapping is required. In this paper, a new model has been developed
   to (1) explain in detail the mechanism and characteristics of design
   activity overlapping and (2) formulate and discuss design activity
   overlapping time-cost trade-off. A qualitative research methodology
   including interviews and focus groups with experts was used to generate
   and refine the model. This model contributes to the body of knowledge of
   construction management by demonstrating (1) how to analyze multipath
   networks through introducing the multi-predecessor effect and (2) how to
   analyze concurrent overlapping through introducing the cascade effect.
   The results of this paper can generate insights for further research to
   solve the overlapping time-cost trade-off and determine the optimum
   overlapping degree. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional crude oil production is declining, while the consumption of
   petroleum-based fuels is increasing. Therefore, bitumen and heavy oil
   exploitation is steadily growing. However, in the present context, heavy
   oil and bitumen exploitation processes are high-energy and
   water-intensive and, consequently, have significant environmental
   footprints because of the production of gaseous emissions, such as CO2,
   and generating huge amounts of produced water. In situ catalytic
   conversion or upgrading is a promising cost-effective and
   environmentally friendly technology that aims at reducing the
   environmental footprints of oil sand exploitation and producing of
   high-quality oil that meets pipeline and refinery specifications. In
   this study, in situ prepared Ni-W-Mo ultradisperse nanocatalysts within
   a vacuum gas oil matrix were used for Athabasca bitumen upgrading in a
   packed-bed flow reactor at a high pressure and temperature. Experiments
   were performed at a pressure of 3.5 MPa, temperatures from 320 to 340
   degrees C, and a hydrogen flow rate of 1 cm(3)/min. The produced liquid
   was analyzed on the basis of residue conversion, microcarbon residue
   (MCR) content, sulfur and nitrogen contents, American Petroleum
   Institute (API) gravity, and viscosity. Results showed that
   nanocatalysts enhanced the quality of Athabasca bitumen by increasing
   the API gravity and decreasing the viscosity and MCR, sulfur, and
   nitrogen contents. Nanocatalysts effectively favored the hydrogenation
   reactions and inhibited the massive formation of coke that usually
   occurs via olefin polymerization and heavy free radical condensation
   during the classical thermal cracking process of heavy oils.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal cracking of Athabasca bitumen was carried out in an oilsand
   packed-bed column, in the presence and absence of in situ prepared
   trimetallic nanocatalysts at a pressure of 3.5 MPa, residence time of 36
   h, and temperatures of 320 and 340 degrees C. In this part of the study,
   the effects of reaction severity (time and temperature) as well as the
   presence of nanocatalysts in packed media on solid and gaseous products
   were investigated. Results showed that the presence of trimetallic
   nanocatalysts enhanced the hydrogenation reactions and, consequently,
   led to significant reduction of coke formation (51.3\%) and CO2 emission
   reduction. Further, the analysis of the gaseous products and deposited
   solids confirmed the previous findings reported in part 1
   (10.1021/ef401716h) of this study. The accumulative volume of coke
   precursor gases, such as ethylene and propylene, increased with the
   reaction severity. However, reaction severity has no significant effect
   on the atomic metallic ratios (metal/total metal) of the employed
   trimetallic nanocatalysts, which clearly demonstrates the stability of
   injected ultradispersed (UD) nanocatalysts (metal/total metal: Mo,
   0.6267; Ni, 0.1808; and W, 0.1924) in the porous media at high pressure
   and temperature. Nonetheless, aggregation of nanocatalysts inside the
   porous media was observed and graphically demonstrated by environmental
   scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) images. Overall, the presence of
   trimetallic nanocatalysts in porous media not just enhanced bitumen
   upgrading but also improved the produced liquid quality and reduced the
   coke content as well as CO2 emission by 50\%.}},

Title = {{Uncertainty Analysis Applied to Thermodynamic Models and Fuel Properties

Abstract = {{A simple, consistent, and self-contained error propagation algorithm was
   developed using the uncertainty information related to pure component
   physical properties, binary interaction parameters, and thermodynamic
   model parameters combined with Monte Carlo simulation along with the
   Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) method. This algorithm is generally
   applicable to simulate the error propagation in process flow sheets of
   arbitrary complexity as long as the thermodynamic model parameters
   encode uncertainty information. In this work, two significant problems
   related to hydrocarbon processing are studied under the light of
   uncertainty analysis. First, the injection of a valuable liquid
   hydrocarbon into an existing natural gas pipeline for transportation was
   studied in order to find the optimum injection rate of liquid n-butane
   that can be safely added to the flowing gas without undesired
   condensation. The main factors considered in this calculation are the
   hydrocarbon dew point, the natural gas physical properties, and
   conformity to pipeline specifications. Second, uncertainties on Reid
   vapor pressure (RVP) calculations were taken into account for the
   calculation of optimal rate of liquid n-butane blending into gasoline.
   Gasoline blending is an important operation in refineries where gasoline
   must be produced with enough volatility for the proper operation of
   engines in cold climates.}},

Journal = {{BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{153}},
Pages = {{173-179}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine if biochar yield could be
   increased by the deposition of volatile pyrolysis species within the bed
   during production, without negatively influencing the microporosity and
   adsorption properties. Aspen (Populus tremuloides) wood chips were
   loaded into three vertically stacked zones within a reactor and heated
   in nitrogen to temperatures between 420 and 650 degrees C (i.e.,
   pyrolyzed). The yield did increase from the zone at the reactor inlet to
   the subsequent zones as volatile species deposited and carbonized, and
   importantly, the carbonized deposits had a similar microporous structure
   and organic vapor uptake (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane) to that of the
   primary biochar. Based on these results, bio-oil from previous runs at
   600 degrees C was recycled to the bed, which further increased the yield
   while maintaining the desirable adsorption properties of the biochar.

Abstract = {{Here, we report on the design, fabrication, and verification of a novel

   loaded Lymnaea stagnalis neurons were stimulated with dual excitation
   wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm; our image sensor detected 510-nm
   emission. We show that our system is capable of detecting intracellular
   calcium changes in Fura-2 loaded neurons. Further, this sensor also
   enabled viewing of multiple neurons over a large surface area
   simultaneously, an option that is not readily available in conventional
   light microscopy.}},

Abstract = {{A concurrent dual-band uneven GaN Doherty power amplifier (PA) for two
   wide-spacing frequencies application is proposed in this paper. To avoid
   an early load modulation-drop caused by the soft turn-on characteristic
   of the peaking device, an adaptive power division is realized by a
   frequency-dependent uneven power divider as well as the input matching
   nonlinearities of the two cells in Doherty PA. Due to the adaptive power
   division, the proposed dual-band uneven Doherty PA achieves a
   power-added efficiency of 45\% and 41\% at the 6 dB backoff from the
   saturation at 850 MHz and 2330 MHz, respectively, the gain of the
   proposed Doherty PA is also enhanced to 19 dB and 13 dB in the dual
   bands. Furthermore, a more accurate two-dimensional joint digital
   predistortion model (2D-JDPD) is applied to linearize the PA and
   compensate for the in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) imbalance
   simultaneously. With this new model, the adjacent channel power ratio
   (ACPR) is improved to better than -47.1 dBc and -49.4 dBc in the lower
   and upper bands at an average output power of 31.75 dBm, and a drain
   efficiency of 26.7\% is obtained at the same time.}},

Title = {{The effects of catalyst on the morphology and physicochemical properties
   of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{116}},
Pages = {{289-292}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Doping of carbon nanotubes with foreign elements, such as boron or
   nitrogen, is one of the most effective ways to change their properties
   to make them suitable for various applications. As the properties of
   nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) originate from their structure,
   it is practical to manipulate their structure during synthesis. We have
   investigated the influence of catalyst on the chemical surface
   properties and morphology of N-CNTs. Different catalysts, such as iron,
   nickel, cobalt and copper, have been tested for the synthesis of N-CNTs.
   The results revealed strong correlations between the properties of
   N-CNTs and the growth catalyst. The highest percentage of nitrogen
   incorporated in the N-CNTs structure was found for the N-CNTs
   synthesized on the nickel catalyst. The use of nickel, cobalt or copper
   catalysts led to the formation of N-CNTs with higher numbers of pyrrolic
   nitrogen doped in the structure, while N-CNTs with higher numbers of
   quaternary nitrogen were synthesized with the iron catalyst. The N-CNTs
   synthesized on iron, nickel and copper had a bamboo-shaped structure;
   and, the majority of the N-CNTs had a hollow-channel structure if
   synthesized on the cobalt catalyst. A higher yield and lower N-CNT
   diameter were obtained using cobalt as the growth catalyst. (C) 2013

Title = {{A Comprehensive Land-Use/Hydrological Modeling System for Scenario
   Simulations in the Elbow River Watershed, Alberta, Canada}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{53}},

Abstract = {{The Elbow River watershed in Alberta covers an area of 1,238 km(2) and
   represents an important source of water for irrigation and municipal
   use. In addition to being located within the driest area of southern
   Canada, it is also subjected to considerable pressure for land
   development due to the rapid population growth in the City of Calgary.
   In this study, a comprehensive modeling system was developed to
   investigate the impact of past and future land-use changes on
   hydrological processes considering the complex surface-groundwater
   interactions existing in the watershed. Specifically, a spatially
   explicit land-use change model was coupled with MIKE SHE/MIKE 11, a
   distributed physically based catchment and channel flow model. Following
   a rigorous sensitivity analysis along with the calibration and
   validation of these models, four land-use change scenarios were
   simulated from 2010 to 2031: business as usual (BAU), new development
   concentrated within the Rocky View County (RV-LUC) and in Bragg Creek
   (BC-LUC), respectively, and development based on projected population
   growth (P-LUC). The simulation results reveal that the rapid
   urbanization and deforestation create an increase in overland flow, and
   a decrease in evapotranspiration (ET), baseflow, and infiltration mainly
   in the east sub-catchment of the watershed. The land-use scenarios
   affect the hydrology of the watershed differently. This study is the
   most comprehensive investigation of its nature done so far in the Elbow
   River watershed. The results obtained are in accordance with similar
   studies conducted in Canadian contexts. The proposed modeling system
   represents a unique and flexible framework for investigating a variety
   of water related sustainability issues.}},

Abstract = {{The stomach plays a critical role in digestion, processing ingested food
   mechanically and breaking it up into particles, which can be effectively
   and efficiently processed by the intestines. When the motility of the
   stomach is compromised, digestion is adversely affected. This can lead
   to a variety of disorders. Current diagnostic techniques for gastric
   motility disorders are seriously lacking, and are based more on
   eliminating other possibilities rather than on specific tests.
   Presently, gastric motility can be assessed by monitoring gastric
   emptying, food transit, intragastric pressures, etc. The associated
   tests are usually stationary and of relatively short duration. The
   present study proposes a new method of measuring gastric motility,
   utilizing the attenuation of an oscillator-induced electrical signal
   across the gastric tissue, which is modulated by gastric contractions.
   The induced high-frequency oscillator signal is generated within the
   stomach, and is picked up transluminally by cutaneous electrodes
   positioned on the abdominal area connected to a custom-designed data
   acquisition instrument. The proposed method was implemented in two
   different designs: first a transoral catheter was modified to emit the
   signal inside the stomach; and second, a gastric retentive pill was
   designed to emit the signal. Both implementations were applied in vivo
   on two mongrel dogs (25.50 kg and 25.75 kg). Gastric contractions were
   registered and quantitatively compared to recordings from force
   transducers sutured onto the serosa of the stomach. Gastric motility
   indices were calculated for each minute, with transluminal impedance
   measurements and the measurements from the force transducers showing
   statistically significant (p < 0.05) Pearson correlation coefficients
   (0.65 +/- 0.08 for the catheter-based design and 0.77 +/- 0.03 for the
   gastric retentive pill design). These results show that transcutaneous
   intraluminal impedance measurement has the potential with further
   research and development to become a useful diagnostic technique.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present and analyze rational-function-based digital
   predistortion (DPD) of transmitters for broadband applications where
   system noise and prominent memory effects contribute to the overall
   nonlinearity of the system. The performance is reported for simulation
   and measured results for gallium nitride (GaN)-based class-AB and
   laterally diffused MOS (LDMOS)-based Doherty power amplifiers (PAs)
   using three different wideband code division multiple access signals
   with peak-to-average-power ratios of around 10 dB. The performance of
   the proposed model, in terms of normalized means-quare error, adjacent
   channel power ratio, matrix condition number, and coefficient
   dispersion, is compared against those of a memory polynomial (MP) model
   and a previously proposed rational-function-based model. It is shown by
   simulation and measurement that the previously proposed absolute-term
   denominator rational functions have limitations in the inverse modeling
   needed for DPD. A new variation of the rational function is proposed to
   alleviate this limitation. Depending on the type of PA and signals, a
   floating-point operation reduction of 8\%-38\% is reported as compared
   with a low-complexity MP model.}},

Abstract = {{The design and fabrication process of a unique pneumatically controlled
   capacitive switch is described. The switch, developed for reconfigurable
   antennas, presents a low-loss alternative switching mechanism, and
   avoids the issue of a complicated biasing layout associated with
   electrostatic actuation in the conducting layer. The closed state of the
   switch is created by a movable copper-coated solid slug that bridges a
   gap in a microstrip line with capacitive coupling. The basis of the
   switching mechanism is pressurized air causing the physical displacement
   of the slug inside a confining dielectric channel. Repeatable switching
   between open and closed states by pneumatically controlling the position
   of the slug was demonstrated with the fabricated switch. The minimum
   pressure required to move the slug was measured. This switch was
   measured from 0.5 to 15 GHz using a Thru-Reflect-Line calibration to
   de-embed the coax-to-microstrip transitions. Insertion loss of 0.2 dB
   and isolation of 25 dB have been achieved at 5 GHz. The successful
   fabrication and measurement of the switch demonstrates the viability of
   applying this technology in reconfigurable antenna designs. (c) 2014

   processes increase the temperature of the bi-material cantilever giving
   rise to a readily observable deflection. The nanomechanical deflection
   of the cantilever as a function of illumination wavelength corresponds
   to the IR absorption spectrum of the adsorbed molecules. Here, we report
   on detection and molecular discrimination of nanogram quantities of
   hydrocarbons on the cantilever using the PCDS technique. The obtained

Abstract = {{The ionomer in the catalyst layer of polymer electrolyte fuel cells
   exists as ultrathin films (4-10 nm) covering the aggregates of Pt/C
   catalyst and may experience elevated temperatures during hot-pressing
   step of the electrode fabrication process. In this study, we report the
   effect of thermal annealing on pertinent ionomer-film properties: proton
   transport and surface wettability. Self-assembled, 10 nm thin Nafion
   ionomer films on silica substrate were heat treated at different
   temperatures in the range 40-160 degrees C. It was found that both
   surface and bulk rearrangement/reorganization occur simultaneously upon
   annealing. Surface reorganization was evident by the dramatic change in
   free-surface wettability from super-hydrophilic to hydrophobic. On the
   other hand, bulk rearrangement was evident from significant depression
   in the proton conductivity with increasing treatment temperature.
   Extended exposure, up to 18 h, to water in vapor form at high humidity
   did not change the protonic conductivity. On the other hand, exposure to
   liquid water resulted in an interesting finding of simultaneous
   regeneration of the film surface and bulk properties. The latter has
   implications for in operando behavior of ionomer in PEFC cathode
   catalyst layers, where local water and heat generation may strongly
   influence its properties.}},

Abstract = {{A rapid method of obtaining photoacoustic spectroscopic signals for
   trace amounts of surface adsorbed molecules using a nanostructured

   nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide cantilever, which has hexagonally
   ordered nanowells with diameters and well-to-well distances of 35 nm and
   100 nm, respectively, are excited using pulsed infrared (IR) light with
   a frequency matching the common mode resonance frequency of the coupled
   resonator. The common mode resonance amplitudes of the coupled resonator
   as a function of illuminating IR wavelength present a photoacoustic IR
   absorption spectrum representing the chemical signatures of the adsorbed
   explosive molecules. In addition, the mass of the adsorbed molecules as
   an orthogonal signal for quantitative analysis is determined by
   measuring the variation of the localized, individual mode resonance
   frequency of a cantilever on the array. The limit of detection of the
   ternary mixture of explosive molecules (1:1:1 of trinitrotoluene (TNT),
   cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX) and pentaerythritol tetranitrate

   the deposition solution, although the outer surface of these films is
   shown to be enriched in Pt. These thin Pt-Jr films, with their highly

Title = {{An analysis of maximum likelihood estimation method for bit
   synchronization and decoding of GPS L1 C/A signals}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Month = {{JAN 14}},
Abstract = {{In weak GNSS signal environments, extending integration time is
   paramount to improving the GNSS receiver's sensitivity. Furthermore,
   sufficient coherent integration can help to mitigate multipath and
   cross-correlation false locks and avoid squaring loss. However,
   extending integration time is limited by the navigation message data
   bit, if present. The maximum likelihood (ML) estimation method has been
   shown as the most effective way to estimate the navigation bit boundary
   locations (i.e., bit synchronization) and subsequently estimate the data
   bit values (i.e., bit decoding) in the presence of noise alone. In this
   paper, the performance of ML bit synchronization and decoding is
   systematically assessed as a function of the number of data bits, the
   effect of Doppler error and received signal power in different tracking
   modes (i.e., phase-locked mode and frequency-locked mode). In addition,
   the theoretical performance models of ML bit synchronization and
   decoding are developed based on statistical theory. The experimental
   validation of the developed performance models and analyses is reported.
   For GPS L1 C/A signals, it is shown that for ML bit synchronization,
   using 100 data bits, the successful synchronization rate (SSR) can reach
   to about 100\% with C/N-0 as low as 20 dB-Hz with no Doppler error. The
   performance degradation caused by Doppler error is not significant if
   the Doppler error is within 5 Hz, and with the maximum tolerance of 25
   Hz, while for ML bit decoding, the successful decoding rate (SDR) of the
   2-bit sequence can reach to about 100\% with C/N-0 as low as 25 dB-Hz
   with no Doppler error. The performance degradation caused by Doppler
   error is not significant if the Doppler error is within 2 Hz. Both

Abstract = {{Novel copper nanowires (CuNVVs)/poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)
   nanocomposites with high dielectric permittivity (epsilon') and low
   dielectric loss (epsilon `') were prepared by a precipitation technique
   followed by melt compression. Their dielectric properties over the
   broadband frequency range, i.e. 10(1)-10(6) Hz, were compared with
   multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT)/PVDF nanocomposites prepared by
   the same technique. It was observed that the CuNWs/PVDF nanocomposites
   had higher dielectric permittivity, lower dielectric loss and thus
   significantly lower dissipation factor (tan delta) than the MWCNT/PVDF
   nanocomposites at room temperature. This behavior was ascribed to a
   higher conductivity of the fresh core of the CuNWs relative to the
   MWCNT, which provided the composites with a higher amount of mobile
   charge carriers participating in the interfacial polarization. Moreover,
   the presence of oxide layers on the CuNWs surfaces diminished the
   conductive network formation leading to a low dielectric loss. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Syngas has shown great success in Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle
   (IGCC) technology for providing cleaner and higher efficiency energy
   production with minimal environment impact. Thus, it is promising that
   Syngas is able to replace the conventional fossil fuel resources, while
   at the same time minimizing pollutants. The drawback of traditional Gas
   Turbines that burn Syngas is that they use diffusion flame combustion
   technology that suffers from low efficiency and high emissions.
   Recently, Lean premixed combustion technique has emerged as a promising
   solution, but the variation of hydrogen fraction in Syngas has
   prohibited its usage. Besides, other gases such as CO2, N-2, H2O, NH3,
   and CH4 in Syngas have adverse effects on the combustion
   characteristics. To address these issues, better understanding of the
   Syngas's fundamental combustion properties are vital. Hence, recent
   works published on Syngas combustion at lean-premixed and Gas Turbine
   relevant conditions are reviewed, classified according to their
   objectives, and remarks were concluded. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen

Abstract = {{Designing biomaterials to mimic and function within the complex
   mechanobiological conditions of connective tissues requires a detailed
   understanding of the micromechanical environment of the cell. The
   objective of our study was to measure the in situ cell-matrix strains
   from applied tension in both tendon fascicles and cell-seeded type I
   collagen scaffolds using laser scanning confocal microscopy techniques.
   Tendon fascicles and collagen gels were fluorescently labelled to
   simultaneously visualise the extracellular matrix and cell nuclei under
   applied tensile strains of 5\%. There were significant differences
   observed in the micromechanics at the cell-matrix scale suggesting that
   the type I collagen scaffold did not replicate the pattern of native
   tendon strains. In particular, although the overall in situ tensile
   strains in the matrix were quite similar (approximate to 2.5\%) between
   the tendon fascicles and the collagen scaffolds, there were significant
   differences at the cell-matrix boundary with visible shear across cell
   nuclei of >1m measured in native tendon which was not observed at all in
   the collagen scaffolds. Similarly, there was significant non-uniformity
   of intercellular strains with relative sliding observed between cell
   rows in tendon which again was not observed in the collagen scaffolds
   where the strain environment was much more uniform. If the native
   micromechanical environment is not replicated in biomaterial scaffolds,
   then the cells may receive incorrect or mixed mechanical signals which
   could affect their biosynthetic response to mechanical load in tissue
   engineering applications. This study highlights the importance of
   considering the microscale mechanics in the design of biomaterial
   scaffolds and the need to incorporate such features in computational
   models of connective tissues.}},

Abstract = {{Cells in the intervertebral disc, as in other connective tissues
   including tendon, ligament and bone, form interconnected cellular
   networks that are linked via functional gap junctions. These cellular
   networks may be necessary to affect a coordinated response to mechanical
   and environmental stimuli. Using confocal microscopy with fluorescence
   recovery after photobleaching methods, we explored the in situ strain
   environment of the outer annulus of an intact bovine disc and the effect
   of high-level flexion on gap junction signalling. The in situ strain
   environment in the extracellular matrix of the outer annulus under high
   flexion load was observed to be non-uniform with the extensive cellular
   processes remaining crimped sometimes at flexion angles greater than 25
   degrees. A significant transient disruption of intercellular
   communication via functional gap junctions was measured after 10 and
   20min under high flexion load. This study illustrates that in healthy
   annulus fibrosus tissue, high mechanical loads can impede the
   functioning of the gap junctions. Future studies will explore more
   complex loading conditions to determine whether losses in intercellular
   communication can be permanent and whether gap junctions in aged and
   degenerated tissues become more susceptible to load. The current
   research suggests that cellular structures such as gap junctions and
   intercellular networks, as well as other cell-cell and cell-matrix
   interconnections, need to be considered in computational models in order
   to fully understand how macroscale mechanical signals are transmitted
   across scales to the microscale and ultimately into a cellular
   biosynthetic response in collagenous tissues.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of significant concentrations of CO2 with methane,
   especially for very lean mixtures in air affects adversely the
   unanalyzed combustion processes of such fuels in common conventional
   devices. The catalytic oxidation of lean homogeneous CH4-CO2-air
   mixtures on a non-adiabatic lab-scale Pt/Al2O3 packed bed reactor was
   investigated numerically. The model employed a two-phase treatment with
   volume averaging for the packed bed while accounting for the effects of
   mass and heat transfers between the solid and gas phases. All three
   modes of heat transfer as well as detailed surface and gas chemical
   kinetics were incorporated. The model was applied to simulate fuel
   oxidation at atmospheric pressure within the reactor that was fed with
   preheated homogeneous lean fuel-air mixtures. The effects of changes in
   the value of inlet feed temperature (600 T-inlet 900 K), equivalence
   ratio (0.15--0.55), and fuel composition (0\%--90\% CO2) were
   investigated. Based on the simulation results, the methane oxidation
   rate was significantly reduced only when the concentration of CO2 in the
   fuel mixture exceeded approximate to 70\%. At very low values of feed
   equivalence ratio or relatively low feed temperatures, the energy
   released by the reaction can become less than that needed to provide the
   energy for preheating the feed. The corresponding values for these
   limiting equivalence ratios were identified for different CO2
   concentrations in the fuel mixture and feed inlet temperatures. For the
   conditions considered the gas phase reactions were predicted to be
   relatively small in comparison to those for the solid phase.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an algorithm is developed for the identification of a
   Hammerstein system in the presence of non-stationary measurement noise
   in the form of an Auto Regressive Integral Moving Average (ARIMA) model.
   Many systems used in the chemical process control industry can be
   modelled with the Hammerstein structure, a block oriented model
   consisting of a memoryless non-linearity followed by a linear filter.
   However, these systems are often subject to random step disturbances
   which violate the stationarity assumptions required by most system
   identification algorithms. Stationarity can be restored by differencing
   the measured output. As a result, parametric identification methods are
   applied to approximate the elements of the modified plant, and noise
   models, as well as the nonlinearity simultaneously using prediction
   error minimization based approaches. Instrumental Variable methods are
   employed to generate good initial estimates of these systems, and so to
   decrease the chances of the optimization getting caught in suboptimal
   local minima. Estimates of the original system components are then
   recovered from the identified model. Monte-Carlo simulation and
   high-order correlation-based validation tests are used to demonstrate
   the performance of the algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{The hierarchy of human knowledge is categorized at the levels of data,
   information, knowledge, and intelligence. For instance, given an
   AND-gate with 1,000-input pins, it may be described very much
   differently at various levels of perceptions in the knowledge hierarchy.
   At the data level on the bottom, it represents a 21,000 state space,
   known as `big data' in recent terms, which appears to be a big issue in
   engineering. However, at the information level, it just represents 1,000
   bit information that is equivalent to the numbers of inputs. Further, at
   the knowledge level, it expresses only two rules that if all inputs are
   one, the output is one; and if any input is zero, the output is zero.
   Ultimately, at the intelligence level, it is simply an instance of the
   logical model of an AND-gate with arbitrary inputs. This problem reveals
   that human intelligence and wisdom are an extremely efficient and a fast
   convergent induction mechanism for knowledge and wisdom elicitation and
   abstraction where data are merely factual materials and arbitrary
   instances in the almost infinite state space of the real world.
   Although data and information processing have been relatively well
   studied, the nature, theories, and suitable mathematics underpinning
   knowledge and intelligence are yet to be systematically studied in
   cognitive informatics and cognitive computing. This will leads to a new
   era of human intelligence revolution following the industrial,
   computational, and information revolutions. This is also in accordance
   with the driving force of the hierarchical human needs from low-level
   material requirements to high-level ones such as knowledge, wisdom, and
   intelligence.
   The trend to the emerging intelligent revolution is to meet the ultimate
   human needs. The basic approach to intelligent revolution is to invent
   and embody cognitive computers, cognitive robots, and cognitive systems
   that extend human memory capacity, learning ability, wisdom, and
   creativity. Via intelligence revolution, an interconnected cognitive
   intelligent Internet will enable ordinary people to access highly
   intelligent systems created based on the latest development of human
   knowledge and wisdom. Highly professional systems may help people to
   solve typical everyday problems. Towards these objectives, the latest
   advances in abstract intelligence and intelligence science investigated
   in cognitive informatics and cognitive computing are well positioned at
   the center of intelligence revolution. A wide range of applications of
   cognitive computers have been developing in ICIC
   {[}http://www.ucalgary.ca/icic/] such as, inter alia, cognitive
   computers, cognitive robots, cognitive learning engines, cognitive
   Internet, cognitive agents, cognitive search engines, cognitive
   translators, cognitive control systems, cognitive communications

   presented. Then, the impact of the finite OFF-state impedance of the
   peaking branch on the efficiency response of the Doherty PA is
   theoretically analyzed. For the practical validation, this problem is
   studied for laterally diffused metal oxide semiconductor (LDMOS) field
   effect transistors (FETs) as well as gallium nitride (GaN) high electron
   mobility transistors (HEMTs). It is demonstrated that GaN HEMTs
   processes superior material properties that make them very suitable for
   the design of high efficiency Doherty PAs. Lastly, an overview of recent
   implementations of GaN monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC)

Abstract = {{In designing reconfigurable antennas, pneumatic control of solid
   dielectric slugs offers an alternative to established technologies of
   reconfigurability, such as PIN diodes and MEMS switches, that require
   biasing feedlines embedded in the radiating structures. A pneumatically
   controlled ring slot antenna capable of switching between LP, LHCP, and
   RHCP is described, in which the dielectric slugs and their enclosing
   channel are fabricated on a different layer. The positions of the slugs,
   controlled by the pressure gradient within the channel, determine the
   polarization state. An axial ratio bandwidth of 5\% was measured, which
   is slightly greater than those of similar antennas with polarization
   diversity using PIN diodes. The measured performance was found to be
   similar to existing reconfigurable antennas, demonstrating that a device
   using pneumatic actuation is a viable alternative.}},

   apertures operating over curvilinear uniformly-spaced element arrays.
   Here, multi-dimensional RF analog filtering is combined with curvilinear
   array processing in order to realize low-complexity wideband receiver
   apertures. These apertures can be combined with curved wing and fuselage
   geometries of UAS technology. The transfer function of a spatially
   discrete temporally-continuous 2-D IIR beam filter is modified to yield
   a linear time-invariant spatially-variant 2-D analog filter. Due to the
   spatially variant nature of the 2-D transfer function, conventional
   methods of computing the frequency/spatial response cannot be applied. A
   new method of computing the 2-D filter response is being investigated.}},

   two 13-Watts GaN HEMTs. After linearization, the proposed DPA exhibits
   drain efficiency higher than 50\% and output power nearly 10 Watts in

   are improved greatly compared with previously reported concurrent
   dual-band DPAs, by about 40 percent and 3 times, respectively. To our

Abstract = {{For an adaptable product, both configuration and parameter values
   associated with the configuration can be adapted in the product
   operation stage to satisfy different requirements. This research aims at
   developing a new design approach to identify the adaptable product whose
   functional performance is the least sensitive to parameter variations
   caused by uncertainties. First different configuration candidates in
   design and different product configurations in operation stage to
   satisfy design requirements are modeled by a novel hybrid AND-OR tree.
   Product/operating parameters associated with configurations are also
   modeled. A two-level optimization method is developed for identifying
   the optimal design configuration and the parameter values: design
   configuration optimization for identifying the optimal design
   configuration and parameter optimization for identifying the optimal
   parameter values associated with this design configuration. Case study
   of an adaptable vibratory feeder is developed to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the newly developed robust adaptable design method.}},

Abstract = {{The use of electromagnetic waves to image the human body is an ongoing
   research topic, in particular, prototype systems have been developed to
   image the breast with the aim of detecting and diagnosing malignancy
   {[}1-3]. At the University of Calgary, our main focus has been the
   development of a monostatic radar system. The first generation prototype
   was tested with 9 patients, generating intriguing results {[}4].
   Currently, the second generation prototype (Figure 1) is being used for
   a larger patient study.
   Radar based imaging recreates a reflectivity map of the imaging domain A
   significant limitation of this technique is the lack of quantitative
   information about the electrical properties of the breast tissues, which
   is required information for coherent summation of reflected signals To
   overcome this problem, we implemented a system to measure microwave
   transmission through the breast {[}5]. This information is then used to
   evaluate the breast composition in terms of a global average of the
   breast electrical properties.
   The first generation of the transmission measurement system, shown in
   Figure 2., consists of a bed on which the women lies prone with her
   breast extending through a hole into an immersion tank filled with a 2\%
   saline solution. In the tank, two sensors are positioned to contact the
   breast skin. The second generation system, shown in figure 3, does not
   require any immersion medium. It also features an array of 5 sensors
   {[}6] on each of the upper and lower plates, enabling the collection of

   is similar to a mammography system as the breast is placed between the

   slight deformation to bring the sensors in contact with the skin.
   Additionally, the simplicity of the system along with user friendly

Abstract = {{This paper presents research on the use of an engineering-to-biology
   thesaurus in an engineering classroom as an aid to teaching biomimicry.
   The leap from engineering to biological science has posed a challenge.
   Engineers often struggle with how to best use the vast amount of
   biological information available from the natural world around them.
   Often there is a knowledge gap, and terminology takes different
   meanings. Generally, the time required to learn and become fluent in
   biology poses too large a hurdle. The engineering-to-biology thesaurus
   was designed to allow engineers without advanced biological knowledge to
   leverage nature's ingenuity during engineering design. The three key
   goals of this thesaurus are to (1) lessen the burden when working with
   knowledge from the biological domain by providing a link between
   engineering and biological terminology; (2) assist designers with
   establishing connections between the two domains; and (3) to facilitate
   biologically-inspired design.
   In this paper, the results of a pilot study as well as a second study
   are presented. The pilot study was used to craft instructional materials
   involving the engineering-to-biology thesaurus. In the second study,
   sophomore engineering students enrolled in a design course were given a
   design task to complete using the thesaurus. The task focused on
   biomimetic concept development for their course project designing a
   human-powered vehicle for a person with cerebral palsy. Results of the
   design task are presented.}},

Abstract = {{This study deals with the effect of the altitude on the performance of a
   Small Wind Turbine (SWT) blade. Four potential regions of wind energy
   with altitudes up to 3,000 m were selected and a three-bladed, 2 m
   diameter small HAWT was designed for those regions. Starting time was
   combined with output power in an objective function to improve the
   performance of the turbine at low wind speeds. The goals of the
   objective function, the output power and the starting performance, were
   addressed by geometry optimization of the blade which was carried out by
   the genetic algorithm. The modified Blade-Element Momentum (BEM) theory
   was applied to calculate the output power and starting time. Results
   show that the performance of an optimal blade which was optimized for
   operating at sea level degrades for other regions. That degradation is
   more important for the starting performance in comparison with the
   reduction of the power coefficient. To improve the performance of the
   blade in the considered regions, two redesign procedures were carried
   out. First, the geometry of the blade was optimized respect to the air
   density of the regions which led to increase of the power coefficient
   and the starting time. Much more power was achieved using the second
   approach in which the tip speed ratio was added to the geometry of the
   blade as an additional design variable. Results also indicate that the
   generator resistive torque remarkably puts off the starting of the
   turbine especially at very high altitudes.}},

Abstract = {{Lean premixed combustion counterflow model coupled with detailed
   chemical kinetics mechanisms are used to study the effects of methane
   dilution on syngas mixture numerically. The work critically evaluates
   and examines the effects of methane additions at various methane/syngas
   ratios and various equivalence ratios ((p = 0.6, 0.65, and 0.7) using
   the CANTERA package. The results of this study increase the feasibility
   of incorporating syngas mixture diluted with methane based fuel for lean
   premixed gas turbine engines. This study indicates that the flame
   velocity of a syngas mixture (H-2:CO-75:25) can be reduced to the flame
   speed of a methane mixture at an equivalence ratio of 0.6 and standard
   conditions (1 atm and 298 K) by mixing it with 50\% of methane. This
   could reduce the flashback propensity that syngas mixtures will incur
   due to the significantly high flame speed. Moreover, this study
   substantiates that the current detailed mechanism is capable of
   predicting the one-dimensional reacting flows and it matches remarkably
   well with experimental data. The approach employed herein can be used to
   optimize and validate detailed chemical kinetics mechanism without the
   need to correct the flame speed to zero strain or stretch free from the

Abstract = {{Geologic CO2 storage (GCS) can provide meaningful reduction of CO2
   emissions if implemented with large injection rates. The traditional
   paradigm for GCS entails injection of supercritical CO2 into a
   brine-filled formation with an implicit assumption that resident brine
   can be displaced through boundaries of the formation without adverse
   effects. In this paradigm, kh, the product of permeability and formation
   thickness, is the first order control on achievable injection rates, and
   the gradual buildup of pressure in the formation during the storage
   operation will reduce those rates. These two factors impose serious
   constraints on the overall storage rate. In contrast, examination of
   field-aggregated injection and production volumes during waterflooding
   operations in oil reservoirs reveals a notable lack of correlation
   between kh and achieved injection rates. This suggests that if CO2
   storage projects are operated in the same manner as waterflooded oil
   reservoirs, i.e. with both injection and extraction wells, located and
   operated to maximize rates, then material rates of storage can be
   achieved regardless of reservoir kh. When applied to a large set of
   storage formations, this mode of operation provides an otherwise
   unattainable overall rate of storage while greatly reducing risks
   associated with elevated pressure in storage regions. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {{In large-scale CO2 sequestration project the formation temperature
   decreases as huge amounts of relatively cool CO2 are injected. Injection
   induced fractures from injectors are facilitated as the critical
   pressure in the formation for fracturing is reduced by considerable
   thermo-elastic stress, which is proportional to the temperature
   difference between CO2 and reservoir. In this study, we analyze
   injection induced fracture growth and its impact on CO2 plume migration
   by a semi-analytical quasi-steady state model in the case that injection
   induced fractures are permitted by regulators. By parametric analysis
   with the model, geological properties and operating conditions are
   investigated to show their sensitivity on fracture growth and CO2
   migration. This work provides analytical tools, which enable fast and
   simple screening of appropriate storage sites and of injection strategy,
   to predict fracturing and CO2 migration to avoid potential risks. (C)

Abstract = {{Local capillary trapping (LCT) occurs during buoyancy-driven migration
   of bulk phase CO2 within a saline aquifer exhibiting spatially varying
   properties (permeability and capillary entry pressure). When the rising
   CO2 plume encounters a region where capillary entry pressure is locally
   larger than average, CO2 accumulates beneath the region. The benefit of
   LCT, applied specially to CO2 sequestration, is that saturation of
   stored CO2 is larger than the saturation predicted for other trapping
   mechanisms, yet the CO2 is not susceptible to leakage through failed
   seals.
   In this paper, the effects of the injection rate, anisotropy, formation
   dip, aquifer types and residual gas saturation on the LCT
   saturation/mass were systematically investigated including the injection
   period. The domain with heterogeneous capillary pressure was generated
   by using geostatistical permeability realization and Leverett-J function
   to assign an individual drainage curve to each grid block. After
   injection, leakage was simulated that represents localized caprock
   breach induced by geochemical process or by stress/strain variation
   within the reservoir/caprock. The trend of the fraction of CO2 above
   residual that remains trapped after seal rupture was evaluated. Residual
   and dissolution trapping were assessed and compared to LCT over time
   during and after injection.
   Results indicate that local capillary traps in the near-well region can
   be fully filled during injection in the domain. Moreover, they remain
   filled after post-injection buoyancy-driven flow ends. The flow regimes
   are dependent on the injection rate, but LCT mass fraction is almost
   insensitive to the CO2 injection rate (gravity number). This implies
   that local capillary trapping is primarily determined by the geological
   model. Anisotropy does not change the LCT structures although it has
   some impact on the LCT CO2 saturation and plume dynamics. Formation dip
   angle is demonstrated to be the most influential parameters on the
   structures and mass fraction of injected CO2 held in LCT, as it changes
   the effective horizontal permeability correlation length. The key
   finding from this research is that LCT could be as significant as
   residual trapping in immobilizing CO2 during the intermediate period in
   the open aquifer. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This

Abstract = {{Extraction of brine containing methane and geothermal energy from saline
   aquifers has been considered as a method to offset the cost of carbon
   capture and storage. This study estimates the potential of power
   generation from methane and heat and compares it with the power required
   for capture and storage. Nine aquifer models were prepared from average
   conditions of several wells in the Gulf Coast at depths from 8,000 to
   16,000 ft. Reservoir simulation study was performed to estimate the
   amounts of stored carbon dioxide and produced methane and heat. The
   study found that the power generation potential from below the depth of
   11,000 ft offsets the power required for capture and storage processes.

Abstract = {{The growth of energy demand over the next few decades with declining
   conventional fossil fuel production implies that greater reliance will
   be placed on unconventional fossil fuel energy sources such as heavy oil
   and extra heavy oil (bitumen). However, unconventional fuels tend to
   have higher environmental impact than their conventional counterparts.
   Here, we focus on the oil sands resource of Alberta, Canada whose
   recovery is both energy and emissions intensive on one hand yet provide
   economic and social benefits to society on the other hand. There is a
   drive to improve the energy and emission intensities of oil sands
   recovery processes. We evaluate the combined application of natural gas
   decarbonization (NGD) with oxy-combustion and the utilization its
   CO2-rich flue gas to achieve an ultra-low emissions enhanced thermal
   recovery process for bitumen from oil sands. We used industry-accepted
   thermal reservoir simulation tools to model steam assisted gravity
   drainage (SAGD) bitumen recovery using a steam-CO2 mixture. Our results
   show that the overall performance of the proposed process when applied
   to a moderately high oil saturation reservoir is improved over the
   current practice both from an energy intensity and a CO2 footprint
   basis. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This work is concerned with the analysis, based on MATLAB simulation, of
   1st and 2nd order Multi-level envelope delta sigma modulators (EDSMs)
   that are used for high efficiency and linearity wireless mobile
   transmitter architectures with an Orthogonal Frequency Division
   Modulation (OFDM) signal and long term evolution (LTE) signal. The
   analysis is based on measuring the linearity and the efficiency of the
   three-level EDSM. It was shown that, at different input signal power
   levels of the three-level EDSM, 1st order three-level EDSM is able to
   achieve a performance that is close to the performance of the 2nd order
   counterpart. While 1st order DSM requires less circuitry, it is
   recommended to employ 1st order three-level EDSM instead of using 2nd
   order three-level EDSM. 1st order three-level EDSM has a signal to noise
   distortion ratio (SNDR) and coding efficiency of 58 dB and 77\%,
   respectively. While 2nd order three-level EDSM showed SNDR of 61.5 dB
   and coding efficiency of 76.4\%. Also, with a long term evolution (LTE)
   signal, the 1st order EDSM has better performance, in terms of SNDR and

Abstract = {{In this paper a comparative study of 10 watt GaN polar transmitters for
   base-station application is carried out. Two main topologies are
   compared and studied. In the first topology, the drain of the transistor
   is modulated with the pulse format of the signal's envelope, and in the
   modified topology, the gate of the transistor is modulated with the
   pulse format of the signal's envelope. The transmitters are compared for
   two main parameters, the power efficiency and the signal quality. After
   a brief description of both topologies, their advantages and
   disadvantages are described, especially in terms of efficiency and
   signal quality. A LTE signal with the bandwidth of 1.4 MHz, the PAPR of
   7.2dB and the sampling rate of 64 is used for comparison purposes. Using
   the LTE signal, the polar architecture with modulated drain bias is able
   to achieve an SNDR of 42dBc and the drain efficiency of 44\%, while an
   SNDR of 35dBc and the drain efficiency of 53\% are obtained for the
   modified polar transmitter with the gate bias modulation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores application of a single Gauss-Laguerre (GL) filter

   one-shot procedure is a robust form of feature extraction performed on

   maintaining a relative recognition accuracy using the extracted
   features. The GL filters can be tuned specifically for each individual
   facial feature or for the entire face to extract useful information.
   This approach demonstrates a 78.12\% and 92.5\% recognition rate by
   applying a single GL filter on the FERET and ORL databases respectively.
   Unlike traditional methods of filter-based feature extraction that
   require a bank of filters to handle minor rotation and occlusion due to
   facial hair, GL requires only one application of an appropriately tuned

   For validation purpose, a six-port receiver was implemented and tested
   using a 3G (WCDMA) signal in the case of a multipath fading channel. The
   MP calibration technique was implemented and tested. By sending a
   training I/Q data into the receiver, the calibration constants were
   estimated from the diode output voltages using the least square
   algorithm. Subsequent analysis using a 3D plot of the error vector
   magnitude (EVM), non-linearity order (N) and memory depth (M) of the MP
   was done to optimize the complexity in terms of the number of
   calibration constants to ensure a good receiver performance. A bit error

   viability of the SPR front-end in a high data rate communication system

Abstract = {{Accurate detection of the major temporal arcade (MTA) in retinal fundus
   images could assist in localization of various anatomical features of
   the retina, such as the optic nerve head (ONH) and fovea, as well as in
   detection of certain types of retinopathy. In this paper, we present a
   novel automated tracking algorithm to obtain a skeleton image
   representing only the MTA, by detection of the vascular tree using Gabor
   filters, detection of the center of the ONH using phase portrait
   analysis, and morphological image processing. The methods were trained
   and tested using two independent sets of 20 retinal images each. The
   results were evaluated in terms of the mean distance to the closest
   point (MDPC) computed for each tracked MTA as compared to its
   corresponding hand-drawn trace. The test results indicate a low average
   MDCP error of approximately 2 pixels per MTA skeleton. The proposed
   algorithm should assist in detection and diagnosis of diseases such as
   proliferative diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity, as
   well as in localization of the ONH and fovea.}},

   results showed the suppression of the spectral regrowth due to the
   intermodulation and cross modulation effects in concurrent dual-band

Abstract = {{A Pulse-Amplitude-Modulated Differential-Time-Signaling (PAM-DTS)
   Architecture for serial communication links is presented in this paper.
   The proposed link utilizes multi-level pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM)
   as-well-as multi-level pulse-position modulation (PPM) of the rising and
   the falling edges of the input clock signal, and uses one transmission
   channel to transmit the data as well as the clock. Applying the
   amplitude modulation to the DTS transmitted signal efficiently increases
   the link rate without significantly affecting the signal bandwidth. A
   65nm CMOS example of a 6-bit 9Gb/s PAM-DTS link has been designed and
   simulated using 1.5GHz as an input clock signal. The simulated power
   consumption of the transmitter and the receiver combination is less than

Abstract = {{Position solutions provided by Global Navigation Satellite Systems
   (GNSS) can be completely misled by structural interference or spoofing
   threats. An approach utilizing an antenna array is proposed in order to
   suppress spoofing attacks. The proposed method is based on the
   assumption that all spoofing signals are transmitted from a single point
   source. A spatial domain processing technique is proposed to extract the
   spoofing signal steering vector and consequently to discard the spoofing
   signals. This method is implemented before despreading and acquisition
   stage of a GNSS receiver. Hence, it does not impose a heavy
   computational load on the receiver operational process since it does not
   require any extensive search in the code and Doppler domains to
   separately despread individual authentic and spoofing signals. Moreover,
   the proposed method does not require any antenna array calibration
   process. This pre-despreading interference mitigation technique is
   further extended to maximize signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of each
   individual authentic GNSS signal. Simulation results show that the
   proposed method effectively countermeasures spoofing attacks for a wide
   range of received spoofing power.}},

Abstract = {{Thermally sprayed coatings have long been used to develop engineered
   surfaces for protection from severe degradation due to abrasive/erosive
   wear. High Velocity Oxy-Fuel (HVOF) thermal sprayed cermet composite
   coatings based on WC-Co systems offer better wear resistance and greater
   application flexibility compared with the traditional surface treatment
   techniques such as hardfacing. Recently, the development of
   nanostructured surfaces based on HVOF deposition of nano-grain WC
   reinforced in a variety of alloy matrix based cermet systems have gained
   research focus thanks to their initial performance results, including
   high hardness and wear properties without concomitant loss of ductility
   or fracture toughness in the sprayed coatings. In this research, the
   novel design and manufacturing of the `duplex Co-coated' nanostructured
   WC-17Ni(80/20)Cr cermet powder is developed. The spraying of the
   feedstock is carried out using a diamond jet DJ2600 HVOF spray gun. In

   employed two predictors primarily using Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, i.e. (1) accumulated growing degree days

   the thresholds for both of the predictors, we extracted temporal trends
   AGDD and NDWI during the period of ground-based CNF observations at the
   lookout tower sites. We found that individual thresholds of AGDD (i.e.,
   200 degree days) and NDWI (i.e., 0.525) were in better agreements (i.e.,
   similar to 85 and similar to 72 \% of the times for AGDD and NDWI
   respectively for similar to 2 periods of deviation) with the
   ground-based CNF observation periods. The combination of the two
   predictors revealed that their logical `OR' combination produced the
   overall best agreements (i.e., on an average similar to 85 \% of the
   times within similar to 2 periods of deviation).}},

Abstract = {{Today's smartphones are powerful devices whose continually increasing
   processing power and wide array of sensors make them well suited for use
   as personal navigation devices. In the absence of information from the
   Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), the onboard inertial sensors
   can be used to provide a relative navigation solution. However, these
   onboard inertial sensors suffer from the effects of different sensor
   errors which cause the inertial-only solution to deteriorate rapidly. As
   such, there is a need to constrain the inertial positioning solution
   when long term navigation is needed. GNSS positions and velocities, and
   WiFi positions are the most important forms of updates available for the
   inertial solution. However, updates from these two sources depend on
   external signals and may not always be available. A rich source of
   information about the outside world can be obtained using the device's
   camera. Nearly all devices have at least one camera which has thus far
   been largely neglected as a navigation aid for these mobile devices.
   There are many indoor scenarios that require accurate height estimates.
   Traditionally, barometers have been used to provide height information.
   However, not all mobile devices that are equipped with inertial sensors
   are also equipped with a barometer. As nearly all devices are equipped
   with at least one camera, it is our aim to use information from the
   camera to aid the inertial-only solution with appropriate height
   estimates.
   Different pattern analysis techniques are used to identify the different
   scenarios. The results are presented for the following common use cases:
   (1) single floor texting mode, (2) stairs texting mode, (3) single floor
   calling mode, (4) stairs calling mode, and (5) fidgeting the phone while
   standing still on a single floor (i.e. ``fidgeting{''}). For each of
   these use cases, first the context will be determined and then the
   relevant information will be used to calculate the height accordingly.
   This work is patent pending.}},

   the system has a small heading misalignment angle. However, a large
   heading misalignment angle would exist during the alignment duration
   under some conditions, especially for marine strapdown inertial
   navigation system (SINS). This paper proposed a time-varying parameters
   based gyrocompass alignment method to solve this problem. Error model of
   gyrocompass alignment with large heading misalignment error is presented
   and an appropriate multi-parameter setting is given, a proper scenario
   for parametric switch is also derived. Simulation and experimental
   results show that the proposed method has better alignment performance
   than conventional ones when the system has a large heading misalignment
   angle.}},

Abstract = {{Multiagent Systems (MAS) consists of many software agents that interact
   to each other to perform their actions and achieve system goals. Due to
   the growing demand of Distributed Software Systems (DSS) and MAS as a
   branch of DSS, the verification of these systems has taken a special
   attention. The verification of these systems is required because MAS and
   DSS are large scale systems, where a failure can result in a huge amount
   of cost or damage. One major field is verification of MAS designs to
   prevent cost of fixing problems after implementation and deployment. The
   agents and interactions among them form a network of agents. This
   network can be used for verification of MAS from different perspectives
   and by various techniques. Visualizing agents' networks can lead to
   detect a special type of unexpected behavior in MAS referred to as
   emergent behaviors and implied scenarios. These unexpected behaviors are
   more probable in large scale systems because the functionality and
   control are distributed and there is lack of central controller in MAS
   and DSS. Consequently, a new scenario can be implied to the system at
   run time which may not be an acceptable behavior in the system. In this
   article, visualization techniques are applied to form three different
   networks extracted from the designs of MAS for this purpose. These
   networks are used to detect emergent behaviors and implied scenarios in
   the system. The methodology, system architecture, data preparation and
   visualization, required network definitions, and results are verified
   through case studies.}},

Abstract = {{The recent GOCE-based global gravity field models are tested in Turkey
   and in two sub-regions, the Istanbul and Sakarya territories, by means
   of geoid undulations. Global gravity field model computed geoid
   undulations are compared with different sets of GPS/leveling-derived
   geoid undulations for different spherical harmonic degree expansions.
   High frequency components of the geoid undulations are estimated from
   EGM2008 and are removed from the GPS/leveling-derived geoid undulations.
   Therefore, model-based and GPS/leveling-derived geoid undulations are
   reduced to about the same gravity spectral band. The comparisons between
   the two geoid undulations are performed directly on the same benchmark
   points and also between the benchmark points by means of geoid slope
   differences. The comparison results suggest that GOCE-based as well as
   GRACE and GOCE combined satellite-only models provide better agreement
   with GPS/leveling-derived geoid than EGM2008 by up to a few centimeters
   for medium wavelength gravity components. Based on the results obtained
   in this study, current and upcoming satellite-based gravity models are
   expected to improve the regional geoid, as well as the regional gravity
   prediction from such models. Turkey is currently discussing the options
   for height system modernization. The investigations performed in this
   study will be useful for the height modernization project of Turkey and
   will help the development of an accurate geoid model and improvement of
   the current vertical datum in the regions.}},

   unification by assessing different factors: the performance of the GOCE

   The effect of the biased local gravity anomalies on the datum offsets is

Abstract = {{Canada plans to implement a geoid-based and GNSS-accessible vertical
   datum in 2013 in order to replace the existing Canadian Geodetic
   Vertical Datum of 1928, which no longer meets the needs of the modern
   user in terms of accuracy and accessibility. One of the primary concerns
   when realizing a geoid-based vertical datum is to determine the W-0
   value that will represent the potential of the zero-height surface.
   Thus, the objective of this study is to determine W-0 by averaging the
   potential of points on the mean water surface by using Canadian tide
   gauge records and GOCE-based global geopotential models. The GOCE-based
   models are extended with the high-resolution gravity field model EGM2008
   in order to assess the effect of the omission error on the computation
   of W-0. Similarly, the regional gravimetric geoid model CGG2010 is also
   used for the estimation of W-0 in order to assess the effect of higher
   frequency contributions of the gravity field, which are missing from the
   GOCE-based global geopotential models. Additionally, sea surface
   topography models are utilized in order to validate the W-0 results
   based on tide gauges and to estimate W-0 values for North America. The
   W-0 values obtained using Canadian tide gauges and high resolution
   gravity field and geoid models are not statistically different from the
   International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service 2010 global
   conventional value of 62,636,856.00 m(2)/s(2).}},

Abstract = {{Biometric-based intelligence in authentication machines (A-machines)
   concerns with the problem of balancing human and machine functions in
   applications such as mass public events and border crossing. The focus
   of this paper is intelligent human-machine interfacing of behavior
   biometrics, which seems to play an important role in future generations
   of A-machines. Various pilot projects use the ``talking face{''}
   technology. We suggest further improvement to A-machines based on
   ``talking robot{''} technology: while interviewing the traveler, a
   humanoid robot recognizes faces and expressions, verifies the
   e-passports and the traveler (using his/her biometrics), connects with a
   watchlist (database), generates cognitive questions and analyzes
   answers, as well as detects soft biometric features in visual and
   infrared spectrum bands, such as temperature and blood pressure. Various
   parts of such technology have been implemented, and the feasibility of
   assembling such a multifunctional system in the form of a robot is to be
   studied and understood. This paper presents a survey of the related
   work, and also provides the authors vision of future generations of
   A-machines and their applications.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (MEMS) technology combined
   with the miniaturization of electronics, have made it possible to
   produce low cost and lightweight chip-based inertial sensors. These
   chips are small, lightweight, consumes very little power, and reliable.
   It has therefore found a wide spectrum of applications in the automotive
   and other industrial applications. MEMS technology, therefore, can be
   used to develop navigation systems that are inexpensive, small, and
   consume low power (microwatt). However, the current achieved performance
   by these low cost sensors is relatively poor due to their sensor errors.
   Nowadays, high-end tactical grade Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) are
   used in pigging applications for estimating the trajectory of geo-pigs
   in pipelines. These types of IMUs are accurate enough to provide an
   acceptable solution. However, the size of the tactical grade IMUs is
   large and cannot be used in the small diameter pipelines (8 `' or less).
   This paper investigates the potential of MEMS-IMUs for positioning of
   the Pipeline Inspection Gauge (PIG) for small pipelines even during the
   unavailability of Above Ground Markers (AGM) which are typically used in
   current PIGs operation.
   Integrating MEMS-IMUs with alternative sensors has the potential of
   providing significant performance improvement. Odometer is a
   complementary sensor that is commonly used to provide simple but
   incomplete and inaccurate position information. It can only measure
   distances and is subjected to unbounded cumulative errors.
   Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is the commonly used technique for
   multi-sensor integration in navigation applications. Furthermore, EKF
   backward smoothing algorithms can be applied to post-process the data.
   EKF smoothing can result in significant performance improvements
   especially for low cost INS integration.
   In this paper, multi-sensor data fusion system is implemented with three
   main sensor types, namely MEMS-IMUs, odometer and Above Ground Marker
   (AGM). In order to improve the performance of integrated navigation
   system, non-holonomic constraints are considered and the navigation
   system is modeled as a linearized dynamic system.
   The performance of the proposed method is examined using real pipeline
   data that has been obtained using MEMS-IMU. The results obtained in this
   paper show that the system is capable of meeting the performance
   requirements for pipeline operators with a reduced number of AGMs (e.g.
   RMSE of the trajectory did not exceed 2.3m over 1 hour of operation and
   with one AGM along the PIG journey).}},

Abstract = {{In the last two decades, the demand for geo-spatial data has
   tremendously increased. Mobile mapping Systems (MMS) are considered the
   main source of data for mapping and Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
   applications. MMS, which integrates navigation systems (such as Global
   Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and Inertial Navigation Systems
   (INS)) and imaging sensors (such as cameras and laser scanners), have
   been an emerging trend in mapping applications because they allow the
   implementation of the mapping concepts from moving vehicles (e.points
   external to the platform in the same mapping coordinate frame.
   Nevertheless, the major drawback of current MMS systems is their high
   price due to the type of the used platform, navigation and mapping
   technologies.
   Today's smartphones are getting more sophisticated and smarter and
   therefore they will narrow the gap between computers and mobile phones.
   Current generation of smartphones are equipped with GNSS receivers,
   microelectro mechanical systems (MEMS) based navigation sensors (such as
   gyroscopes, accelerometers, magnetometers, and barometers) and high
   resolution digital cameras. As a result, smartphones are now getting
   quite popular for data collection projects including point data mapping
   tasks and it is not far before we see smartphones are used as mobile
   mappers. This paper will present a new and innovative application of a
   portable MMS based on smartphones that overcome the high-cost drawback
   of the current land-based MMS with reasonable accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{INS/GPS and INS/ZUPT techniques are complementary for pedestrian
   navigation applications. For optimal use of INS/ZUPT, the MEMS sensors
   are best mounted on a foot of a user, since the foot can periodically
   become stationary, thus applying ZUPT. For GPS/INS based module is best
   mounted on the upper body of the user, so that the user's body does not
   block the GPS signals. In this paper, we propose a new solution for a
   pedestrian navigation scheme to fuse the information from the two
   systems. When both systems are used at the same time, a constraint that
   a spatial maximal distance of 1.5 m between the positions estimates of
   the two systems exists. Through exploring this external information, the
   state constraint Kalman filter was used to minimize the positioning
   errors of both systems. The experimental results show that when GPS is
   available, the INS/ZUPT sub-system's positioning errors could be well
   bounded; on the other hand, when GPS signal is not available
   (simulated), the INS/GPS sub-system's positioning accuracy could also be
   significantly improved.}},

Abstract = {{Precise point positioning (PPP) integer ambiguity resolution is able to
   significantly shorten the time-to-first-fix (TTFF) and improve the
   positioning accuracy when fractional cycle biases (FCBs) are available
   to recover the integer feature of the ambiguities. When real-time orbit
   and clock products are used to estimate the satellite FCB corrections,
   the narrow-lane (NL) FCB corrections would be biased by the
   Line-Of-Sight (LOS) errors in the real-time orbits and clocks. The
   slightly biased NL FCB estimate, even it does not affect the
   identification of the correct integer ambiguities, may deteriorate the
   positioning accuracy. We propose a method for satellite FCB generation,
   which assimilates the orbit and clock errors to further improve the
   performance of PPP ambiguity resolution (AR). The satellite NL FCB
   corrections are modeled by one direction-independent component and three
   directional-dependent components for each satellite, instead of only one
   direction-independent component. The direction-independent component
   assimilates actual FCBs and clock errors whereas the
   directional-dependent components are used to assimilate the orbit
   errors. GPS measurements from an experimental network with 28 stations
   in North America are processed with the IGS-RT products on doy 103. The
   improvements by the proposed FCB generation method are validated in
   terms of the mean and RMS values of the estimated FCBs, the ambiguity
   fix-rate as well as the obtainable positioning accuracy. The numerical
   results confirm that the obtained FCBs using the proposed method
   outperform the original FCBs which improve not only the ambiguity fix
   rate but also the position solution.}},

Abstract = {{Ionospheric scintillations are generally characterized via scintillation
   indices, calculated from amplitude and phase of the received GNSS
   signals. For many scintillation monitoring and mitigation applications,
   it is important to determine these indices accurately. Investigating
   appropriate data algorithms (here, data detrending) in deriving
   scintillation information for mitigation applications is the focus of
   this paper.
   Commonly, most GNSS receivers use a Butterworth filter with a fixed
   cutoff frequency of 0.1 Hz to remove low frequency trends from the data
   {[}Forte and Radicella 2002, Mushini, et al., 2012]. However, as shown
   in Forte and Radicella, 2002, inherent characteristics of ionospheric
   effects at different regions require different detrending settings. In
   this study, four detrending methods and effectiveness of each are
   examined using real data sets from high latitude and equatorial regions.
   Based on our results, it is observed that data detrending via
   wavelet-based filter can result in cleaner (less noisier) signal. In
   addition, correlation between computed amplitude and phase scintillation
   indices improves when wavelet filtering is used. Moreover, we present
   initial considerations for scintillation monitoring and mitigation via
   exploiting new GNSS signals to determine additional information.
   To examine real data, IF samples from scintillation events are
   post-processed using the GSNRx (TM) software receiver, developed by the
   Position, Location and Navigation (PLAN) group at the University of
   Calgary. This software receiver has the capability of processing GPS
   L1C/A and L2C signals. Scintillation parameters are calculated using the
   post-correlator in-phase (I) and quadra-phase (Q) components and carrier
   phase measurements, all obtained from the software receiver.}},

Abstract = {{The University of Calgary PLAN group's GSNRx (TM) software receiver has
   been updated for use in orbital simulations. The updates included
   redesigned algorithms for satellite visibility calculations, the
   inclusion of a Kepler orbit model, an updated channel allocation
   strategy, a navigation solution reset when an insufficient number of GPS
   satellites are being tracked, and a disabling of the tropospheric
   corrections in the navigation solution. The redesigned GSNRx (TM) has
   been used for hardware in the loop simulations of tracking and
   navigation in highly elliptical orbit (HEO). The HEO scenario has been
   set up based on the orbital parameters of the European Space Agency's
   planned Proba-3 mission. A realistic link budget has been assumed, and
   error sources such as ionospheric delay and GPS orbital errors have been
   simulated.
   Under HEO simulation, the receiver reliably acquires at 37 dB-Hz and
   stronger, and maintains lock under HEO orbital dynamics. Loss of lock
   typically occurs between 28 and 30 dB-Hz for fading signals, with some
   signals tracked to 26 dB-Hz. The measurement noise is highly correlated
   with the highly variable HEO signal strength and is slightly higher than
   the theoretical thermal noise tracking jitter at the same carrier to
   noise density ratios. The receiver's single point navigation solution
   agrees well with the simulated trajectory where ionospheric errors are
   small, but is highly sensitive to the ionospheric range delay on setting
   GPS satellites and weakening positioning geometry at high altitude. A
   Kalman filtered navigation solution using GPS measurements and an
   orbital model was implemented. The results were accurate to the meter
   level during the two perigee passages when position fixes were possible,
   and diverged to a few hundred meters during the 18 hour arc between
   fixes.}},

Abstract = {{GNSS receivers have already widely been used in vast applications. The
   focus of this paper is to improve the capability in harsh environments.
   In a high sensitivity receiver, a conventional approach is to first
   detect signals on satellite-by-satellite basis, then generate
   measurements and estimate a position solution.
   To further enhance the receiver performance, researchers have proposed
   to non-coherently make use of all-in-view satellite information.
   Examples of this include `collective detection' and `maximum likelihood
   positioning'. Both approaches investigated the potentials of this
   `joint' approach either in a detection aspect by evaluating the receiver
   operating characteristic (ROC) or an estimation aspect based on an
   estimator's Cramer-Rao lower bound. The term `joint' is used in this
   paper because this approach automatically combines detection (of all
   available satellites) and estimation (navigation solution) process
   together.
   In this paper, maximum a posteriori (MAP) detection and estimation
   analysis of conventional block processing, receiver and `joint' approach
   receiver has been conducted, and comparisons have been worked out.
   Metrics such as a posteriori likelihood ratio/detection rate is derived,
   which depend on both the estimation and detection metrics. In the end, a
   joint approach coarse-time high sensitivity software receiver with long
   non-coherent integration has been implemented and demonstrated. Real
   data from indoor environment shows promising improvements over
   conventional coarse-time block processing receiver.}},

   patterned surfaces. The ego-motion estimation is robustly partitioned
   into a sequence of 2DOF and 4DOF estimations. The 2DOF algorithm uses
   the sequence of raw camera images to estimate the camera tilt angles and
   subsequently compensates the images such that the camera image plane is
   coplanar with the tiled surface. The 4DOF algorithm then takes the
   sequence of tilt-compensated images as the input and uses Least Squares
   (LS) and Kalman Filter (KF) processes to estimate the differential
   translation, azimuthal rotation and change in height between two
   consecutive image frames. The algorithm has been verified experimentally
   to provide robust performance while achieving an accuracy of few
   millimeters in the estimation of the trajectory.}},

Abstract = {{As the MEMS (Micro-Electro Mechanical Systems) IMU (Inertial Measurement
   Unit) outputs are corrupted by significant sensor errors, the navigation
   errors of the MEMS-based inertial navigation system accumulate very
   quickly, and so does its integrated system with GNSS (Global Navigation
   Satellite Systems) when GNSS measurements are not available. This paper
   proposed a rotary INS (Inertial Navigation System) to mitigate the
   navigation errors caused by the significant MEMS inertial sensor errors
   by rotating the IMU. A rotary INS is an inertial navigator in which the
   IMU is installed on a rotation platform that rotates the IMU following
   pre-defined rotation schemes. As the proper IMU rotation can average out
   the sensor errors without the need for external information, such
   technique had been widely accepted marine navigation for submarines and
   warships. However it has not been investigated for low-cost MEMS IMU
   systems.
   In this research, different IMU rotation schemes (rotation about X, Y
   and Z axes) are employed and the mitigation of navigation errors caused
   by inertial sensor errors through IMU rotations is analyzed
   mathematically. Simulations are conducted to verify the error mitigation
   analysis in rotary INS. By using a tri-axial rotation table, the
   prototypes of the rotary INS are developed based on two MEMS IMU,
   namely, MTi-G and NAV440, respectively. The static tests are conducted
   and the results indicate that although the rotation of IMU can mitigate
   the navigation errors caused by inertial sensor errors, it also
   motivates additional sensor errors due to the gyro scale factor and
   installation errors, which results additional navigation errors.
   Therefore, a calibration of these sensor errors for MEMS-based rotary
   INS is required.}},

Abstract = {{Modern day personal navigation devices are often realized as a
   multi-sensor integrated navigation system wherein the measurements from
   various sensors are combined to generate a navigation solution. A fault
   occurring in any of these sensors can affect the performance of the
   navigation system, potentially compromising the reliability of the
   navigation solution. It is thus imperative to detect and remove faults
   occurring in the individual sensors before they are integrated in a
   navigation filter.
   In an attempt to improve the reliability of the navigation solution,
   this paper proposes a sensor validation scheme that exploits the
   analytical redundancy between the dissimilar sensors used in
   multi-sensor integrated systems to detect and remove the faults in
   individual sensor measurements. The paper identifies possible fault
   scenarios in the sensors being used and characterizes some of the sensor
   faults through experimental analysis. The proposed scheme is then
   analyzed using both simulated and real sensor fault scenarios. In both
   scenarios, the proposed scheme successfully detects the sensor faults.
   Moreover, the subsequent implication of the fault detection scheme in
   the position solution is also analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of obtaining a long-term accurate positioning solution in
   indoor environments has been an emergent topic in the world of business
   and academia in recent years. In the absence of information from the
   Global Positioning System (GPS), the inertial sensors within a
   smartphone can be used to provide a relative navigation solution.
   However, these onboard Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) based
   sensors suffer from the effects of different sensor errors which cause
   the inertial-only solution to deteriorate rapidly. As such, there is a
   need to constrain the inertial positioning solution when long-term
   navigation is needed. GPS positions and velocities, and WiFi positions
   are the most important forms of updates available for the inertial
   solution. However, updates from these two sources depend on external
   signals and infrastructure that may not always be available. Another
   problem specific to smartphone based navigation stems from the fact that
   a user does not use the device in one specific or unchanging orientation
   and the device is free to change orientation with respect to both the
   user and the direction of motion. To overcome these limitations,
   researchers are looking at other means of providing constraints to the
   inertial-only solution.
   One commercial product that attempts to fill the niche of a truly
   portable, low-cost, long-term accurate indoor positioning solution is
   the InvenSense Positioning App (IPA) developed by InvenSense Canada. The
   IPA is an inertial-based system running on smartphones that provides a
   3D navigation solution even in the absence of information from the GPS.
   The IPA uses proprietary and patented algorithms to estimate the
   misalignment of the device with respect to the moving platform, making
   it agnostic to any specific device orientation.
   A rich source of information about the outside world can be obtained
   using the device's camera. Nearly all devices have at least one camera
   which has thus far been largely neglected as a navigation aid.
   Parameters extracted from the stream of images are used to aid several
   modules within the IPA. The vision aiding module performs context
   classification to provide device angle with respect to the platform,
   height change information in different scenarios, as well as static
   period and fidgeting detection. This information is used by the IPA in
   the form of misalignment, external height, and zero velocity updates.
   The results of the integration of the vision aiding module with the IPA
   show significant improvement in many cases. This work is patent pending.}},

Abstract = {{Reliable positioning in urban canyon, especially in dense urban areas,
   is difficult to achieve in a cost-effective manner using standalone
   Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), due to multipath problems and
   Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) signals. In this regard, several researches
   have focused towards identifying and rejecting NLOS measurements.
   However, very few researches have used NLOS signals, although generating
   final position using only one of the signals. In this regard, this
   research utilizes all the available signals, including all NLOS signals,
   from all the satellites, in order to estimate position, using an
   algorithm based on concept of constructive use of NLOS signals. The NLOS
   signals are used constructively by incorporating the information related
   to nearby reflectors, with the help of a 3D city model. The feasibility
   and performance of the algorithm was done using a real data collected in
   Downtown Calgary. In a way, this research attempts towards building a
   low cost GNSS based technology for improved navigation performance, in
   scenarios where fewer satellites are available and rejecting
   measurements due to blunders might cost a crucial stake of availability.}},

   performs the RFI identification in every individual channel.
   Subsequently, a new observation weighting (OW) algorithm is developed to

   is present. Performance of the ID and the ultra-tight receiver, aided by

Abstract = {{Raw scintillation data sets would ideally consist of high-rate IF
   samples collected directly from a hardware front end. These digital
   samples can be processed in post-mission using a GNSS receiver, allowing
   evaluation of different signal acquisition and tracking strategies. In
   practice, however, the data storage and management associated with such
   large IF data sets are prohibitive and more typically, only
   post-correlator in-phase (I) and quadraphase (Q) samples at a lower data
   rate are provided by commercial units in the field. To exploit these low
   frequency data sets from commercial receivers for post-processing in a
   software receiver, some manipulation of the observations is required. In
   this study, we have introduced a method to exploit raw data from

Abstract = {{Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)-based attitude determination
   has been recognized as a significant field of study in numerous ground,
   marine and airborne applications. This paper investigates the
   feasibility of precise attitude determination using a GNSS receiver
   capable of antenna array processing. The ability to determine attitude
   parameters by employing only a single satellite signal distinguishes
   this approach from methods based on carrier phase measurements and
   ambiguity resolution. This is especially important in challenging
   environments where a limited number of satellites are available.
   Moreover, this approach has the advantage over other methods by
   employing an antenna array with short spacing between adjacent antennas
   (less than half a wavelength), especially where the structural dimension
   is an important concern such as in small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV).
   Herein, a modified version of the recursive least squares (RLS) method
   is proposed to adaptively estimate each satellite's steering vector and
   then the roll, pitch and heading angles of a moving vehicle. The
   proposed adaptive method is fast and computationally of low complexity
   and therefore it can properly operate in real time applications.
   The proposed method is applied to a set of real GPS L1 signals collected
   using a six-element antenna array to verify its effectiveness and assess
   its performance. A tactical-grade inertial navigation sensor (INS) is
   used as reference to evaluate the accuracy of heading estimates in a
   scenario where the array is mounted on a moving vehicle.}},

Abstract = {{In traditional GNSS receiver architectures, the receiver normally
   acquires the visible satellite signals and keeps tracking them
   throughout their availability. Although this approach is perfectly
   viable for reliable and accurate positioning in most applications,
   tracking all satellites in view throughout the receiver power-on
   duration results in a significant penalty on power consumption in
   battery-operated portable devices. Modern GNSS receivers employ cyclic
   tracking or intermittent tracking to conserve power. The receiver
   temporarily halts signal tracking during a ``sleep period{''}, and
   continues tracking in the remaining ``active period{''}. The ratio of
   active period duration to the total duration within a position update
   interval expressed as a percentage is known as the duty cycle.
   The duty cycles employed in portable receiver design are generally
   heuristic in order satisfy a given set of requirements on power
   conservation and position accuracy. A thorough analysis of possible duty
   cycles as a function of targeted user position and velocity accuracy for
   various user dynamics is therefore necessary. This paper investigates
   various aspects of intermittent Global Navigation Satellite System
   (GNSS) signal tracking and analyzes positioning and tracking performance
   with various duty cycles for three different user motion cases.}},

Abstract = {{The chemical selectivity challenge of microcantilever sensors can be
   overcome by photothermal cantilever deflection spectroscopy (PCDS). A
   bi-material cantilever responds to heat generated by non-radiative decay
   process when the adsorbed molecules are resonantly excited with infrared
   (IR) light. The variation in cantilever deflection amplitude as a
   function of illuminating IR wavelength corresponds to the conventional
   IR absorption spectrum of the adsorbed molecules. In addition, the mass
   of the adsorbed molecules can be determined by measuring the resonance
   frequency shift of the cantilever for the quantitative analysis. This
   technique offers unprecedented opportunities for highly selective as
   well as sensitive chemical sensing without relying on chemoselective
   interfaces. However, conventional optical signal readout schemes
   employed for microcantilever sensors pose challenges on miniaturization
   and system level integration. Here, we demonstrate PCDS using a
   piezoresistive cantilever which can be easily miniaturized and
   integrated into a portable sensor platform.}},

Abstract = {{Test automation is a widely-used approach to reduce the cost of manual
   software testing. However, if it is not planned or conducted properly,
   automated testing would not necessarily be more cost effective than
   manual testing. Deciding what parts of a given System Under Test (SUT)
   should be tested in an automated fashion and what parts should remain
   manual is a frequently-asked and challenging question for practitioner
   testers. In this study, we propose a search-based approach for deciding
   what parts of a given SUT should be tested automatically to gain the
   highest Return On Investment (ROI). This work is the first systematic
   approach for this problem, and significance of our approach is that it
   considers automation in the entire testing process (i.e., from test-case
   design, to test scripting, to test execution, and test result
   evaluation). The proposed approach has been applied in an industrial
   setting in the context of a software product used in the oil and gas
   industry in Canada. Among the results of the case study is that, when
   planned and conducted properly using our decision-support approach, test
   automation provides the highest ROI. In this study, we show that if
   automation decision is taken effectively, test-case design, test
   execution, and test evaluation can result in about 307\%, 675\%, and
   41\% ROI in 10 rounds of using automated test suites.}},

Abstract = {{Naturally fractured reservoirs, within which porosity, permeability
   pathways and/or impermeable barriers formed by the fracture network
   interact with those of the host rock matrix to influence fluid flow and
   storage, can occur in sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic rocks. These
   reservoirs constitute a substantial percentage of remaining hydrocarbon
   resources; they create exploration targets in otherwise impermeable
   rocks, including under-explored crystalline basement, and they can be
   used as geological stores for anthropogenic carbon dioxide. Their
   complex fluid flow behaviour during production has traditionally proved
   difficult to predict, causing a large degree of uncertainty in reservoir
   development. The applied study of naturally fractured reservoirs seeks
   to constrain this uncertainty and maximize production by developing new
   understanding, and is necessarily a broad, integrated, interdisciplinary
   topic. Some of the methods, challenges and advances in characterizing
   the interplay of rock matrix and fracture networks relevant to fluid
   flow and hydrocarbon recovery are reviewed and discussed via the
   contributions in this volume.}},

Abstract = {{Disaster management requires that various geospatial data producers and
   users collaborate in an ad hoc manner, despite their different
   backgrounds and contexts. While semantic interoperability is meant to
   support meaningful sharing of geospatial data, semantic interoperability
   approaches that were designed for static and closed environments, or
   that do not address the particularities of geospatial data, are not
   suitable for supporting disaster management. In this paper, we present
   the Real-Time-CPAR prototype for enabling real time semantic
   interoperability in ad hoc network of geospatial databases that can
   answer the needs of disaster management. The prototype comprises four
   main services for discovering coalitions of geospatial databases;
   semantic enrichment; semantic reconciliation of heterogeneous databases
   and propagation of geospatial queries. We demonstrate how this tool can
   contribute to disaster management.}},

Abstract = {{Context: Release readiness (RR) quantifies the status of a product
   release by aggregating a portfolio of release related measures. Early
   identification of factors responsible in improving RR (i.e. RR
   improvement factors) can help project managers to (re) allocate
   resources to improve processes to achieve higher level of RR score.
   Objective: This paper has two objectives: i) to identify time-dependent
   RR improvement (RRI) factor(s); and ii) to identify a budget allocation
   strategy for maximum improvement of RR score for the upcoming time
   interval.
   Method: RELREA is an existing approach that determines RR from
   aggregating the degree of satisfaction of a portfolio of release
   process, product, deployment and support related measures. The proposed
   method DAICO enhances RELREA by performing dynamic instead of static
   analysis. For that purpose, the RRI factors identification problem is
   formulated and solved as a genetic optimization problem. Subsequently,
   recommendations are generated for cost-optimized RR improvement.
   Results: We demonstrated the applicability of the DAICO method for
   release Publify 8.0 of an ongoing project Publify, hosted in GitHub OSS
   repository. Main contributions of this paper are: i) Formulating
   identification of RRI factors as an optimization problem, ii) Modeling
   and solving the problem using a GA, iii) Providing recommendations for
   cost-optimized RR improvement
   Conclusions: DAICO is a part of an ongoing effort to detect, and analyze
   RRI factors when achieving RR. This method is intended to detect RRI
   factors earlier and to guide the effort spent on improving RR.}},

Abstract = {{Electrokinetic phenomena are widely studied techniques used for
   micro-scale fluid delivery in many microfluidic application areas such
   as drug delivery, lab-on-achip, and biochemical analysis. AC
   electrothermal (ACET) micropumps are capable of operating at low
   voltages (up to 10 1/7.,) and are suitable for applications involving
   high conductivity fluids (higher than 0.1 S/m), such as biological
   fluids. Electrothermal flow is induced by temperature gradients in the
   presence of a non-uniform electric field. ACET micropumps reported to
   date have low flow rates (up to 100n1/s) and relatively low
   back-pressures (up to 1kPa), limiting their utility. In addition, ACET
   arrays reported in the literature typically feature only a few electrode
   pairs. In this paper a long fluidic micro-channel, featuring an ACET
   micropump consisting of a row of 64 asymmetric coplanar microelectrodes
   is studied in order to investigate the effect of the number of
   microelectrode pairs on fluid flow. A simulation study is also performed
   for different numbers of microelectrode pairs. The results show that
   increasing the number of microelectrode pairs is an efficient way for
   increasing fluid flow of high conductivity fluids using ACET.}},

Journal = {{BIORHEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{409-422}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The contribution of proteoglycan 4 (PRG4) to synovial fluid
   and hyaluronan (HA) solution rheology are poorly understood. The effects
   of PRG4 disulfide-bonded structure on viscosity and viscosity of newly
   available full-length recombinant human PRG4 (rhPRG4) have not
   previously been reported.
   OBJECTIVE: This study determined the viscosity of PRG4 and rhPRG4, R/A
   (reduced and alkylated) PRG4 and rhPRG4, and PRG4 and rhPRG4 + HA
   solutions.
   METHODS: Steady shear viscosities of 1.5 MDa HA, PRG4 from bovine
   cartilage explant culture, rhPRG4 and (rh) PRG4 + HA solutions were
   measured with 40 mm parallel plate fixtures.
   RESULTS: PRG4 demonstrated shear-dependent viscosity at high
   concentrations, but Newtonian behaviour at low concentrations and when
   disulfide-bonded/multimeric structure was disrupted by R/A. rhPRG4
   demonstrated Newtonian behaviour over all concentrations tested and upon
   R/A. At high HA concentrations, rhPRG4 reduced solution viscosity,
   suggesting a binding interaction. At low HA concentrations, solution
   viscosity was increased relative to HA alone, possibly due to
   self-association of rhPRG4. Effects of PRG4 on HA solution viscosity
   were dependent on PRG4's disulfide-bonded structure.
   CONCLUSIONS: The finding that rhPRG4 can increase the viscosity of low
   concentration HA solutions suggests that supplementation with rhPRG4 may
   help mitigate the loss in synovial fluid viscosity experienced with
   decreased HA concentration in osteoarthritis.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a single-fiber, zero source-detector separation system with
   wavelength-resolved detection for measuring oxygen saturation in deep
   brain structures. The system consists of a white light emitting diode
   (LED) source, optics to couple light into a 240-mu m-diameter fiber, a
   beam splitter to separate the collected from the delivered photons and a
   spectrometer for detection. Depth resolution is achieved by inserting
   the fiber, comparable in size to microelectrodes used for
   electrophysiology, into the tissue of interest. Since most of the
   diffuse reflected light travels through a small volume at the tip of the
   fiber, this arrangement allows efficient collection of signal. Fresnel
   reflections are minimized using polarizers. Monte Carlo simulations
   across 400-1000 nm indicate that similar to 0.5\% of the incident light
   can be collected and effectively interrogate a similar to 0.02 mm(3)
   volume at the fiber tip. System design, characterization data and
   phantom experiments using an absorptive dye in scattering media are
   presented. The simple nature of the instrumentation can potentially lead
   to a miniaturized system capable of detecting oxygen saturation in deep
   brain structures in freely-moving animals.}},

Abstract = {{We present a comprehensive and fully automated system for computer-aided
   detection and diagnosis of masses in mammograms. Novel methods for
   detection include: selection of suspicious focal areas based on analysis
   of the gradient vector field, rejection of oriented components of breast
   tissue using multidirectional Gabor filtering, and use of differential
   features for rejection of false positives (FPs) via clustering of the
   surrounding fibroglandular tissue. The diagnosis step is based on
   extraction of contour-independent features for characterization of
   lesions as benign or malignant from automatically detected circular and
   annular regions. A new unified 3D free-response receiver operating
   characteristic framework is introduced for global analysis of two binary
   categorization problems in cascade. In total, 3,080 suspicious focal
   areas were extracted from a set of 156 full-field digital mammograms,
   including 26 malignant tumors, 120 benign lesions, and 18 normal
   mammograms. The proposed system detected and diagnosed malignant tumors
   with a sensitivity of 0.96, 0.92, and 0.88 at, respectively, 1.83, 0.46,
   and 0.45 FPs/image, with two stages of stepwise logistic regression for
   selection of features, a cascade of Fisher linear discriminant analysis
   and an artificial neural network with radial basis functions, and
   leave-onepatient- out cross-validation.}},

   In this work, we propose a new angle-variation-based measure for
   quantification of tortuosity in retinal fundus images of preterm
   infants. The methods include the use of Gabor filters to detect vessels
   as well as to obtain their orientation at each pixel. Morphological
   image processing methods are used to obtain a skeleton image of the
   vessels for measurement of tortuosity. Out of 11 vessel segments, marked
   by an expert ophthalmologist as showing high levels of tortuosity due to
   plus disease, all were correctly identified using the proposed methods.}},

Abstract = {{Regression analyses were performed to study the relationship between
   rail transit network parameters (e.g., length of line, age of the
   system, network topology) with city parameters (e.g., population, city
   area, population density). Transit ridership patterns in Europe, Asia,
   and North America were investigated. Ring transit lines were found to be
   an important factor in network topology and the improvement of transit
   network efficiency and reliability. Cities that had ring rail transit
   services were assessed. Parameters that justified the implementation of
   a rail transit network in a city, particularly a ring line, were
   analyzed through the investigation of cities that had implemented such
   services. Ring lines were seen to be less popular in North America than
   in Europe and Asia. A highly concentrated central business district
   surrounded by remote residential neighborhoods would make
   circumferential travel less appealing than in larger and mixed land-use
   city centers with several cross-town activity centers. Further
   regression analyses were conducted to investigate the relevant
   parameters for the length of a ring rail transit line. Arguably, a ring
   transit line can improve the connectivity and directness of a transit
   network and thus improve transit ridership.}},

Abstract = {{Worldwide, short track (ST) speed skaters are incurring a notable number
   of concussions when hitting the padding that surrounds the dasher boards
   in their training and racing environments. Recent findings regarding the
   influence of helmet shape and size on peak linear deceleration values
   suggest that these factors matter in ST speed skating where impacts take
   place against compliant surfaces. This work expands upon the initial
   findings in several ways. In both of these studies, two types of test
   articles were dropped in free fall from various heights onto a crash
   pad. The ``shape{''} test articles were cylindrical missiles with an
   end-cap of fixed area but variable radius of curvature. The expanded
   polystyrene end-caps had diameter values of 8, 12, 15.6, 24, and 30 in.
   (20.3, 30.5, 39.6, 61.0, and 76.2 cm). The ``size{''} test articles were
   expanded polystyrene hemispheres of these same five diameters. Wireless
   3D accelerometers (MicroStrain) were used to record acceleration while
   an Olympus iSpeed 2 high speed camera (1000 fps) recorded impact
   velocity. In the current work, impact velocities up to 12 m/s were
   employed. Peak linear deceleration, Head Injury Criterion (HIC), and
   peak jerk were determined for every impact condition. The influence of
   impact position on the crash mat (side, end, middle, and corner) was
   characterized with differences of up to 30 \% in peak deceleration and
   60 \% in HIC values being measured between middles and corners.
   Penetration depths into the middle of the crash pad were also measured.
   Current results present a more complete picture of how helmet size and
   shape can affect some variables implicated in concussions. Smaller
   helmets produce lower peak deceleration and HIC values, and higher
   penetration depths. Rounder helmets penetrate more deeply into pads. At
   high impact speeds, the thickness and stiffness of pads likely affect
   the optimal helmet shape and size.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce the first analysis of ship detection
   performance using simulated RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) data in

   (CP) dual-polarimetric (dual-pol) systems data simulated from RADARSAT-2
   Fine quad mode in the three RCM modes. The impact of the ship
   orientation with respect to the radar beam and the effect of the imaging
   mode incidence angle on the ship detection performance are investigated.
   It has been found that the compact polarimetric SAR detectors outperform
   the linear dual-pol ones at all RCM modes for medium to high beam
   incidence angle range. The study findings suggest that the three RCM
   modes generally and the Ship Detection mode in particular are promising

   CMOS all-pass filters for achieving the desired time delays, is
   discussed in this work. The use of all-pass filters eliminates the need

   previously reported DAS beamformers. The proposed all-pass filter can
   achieve approximately linear-phase delay across GHz-range of
   frequencies, which is amendable for wide-band beamforming. The
   delay-and-sum section of the beamformer was designed and simulated for
   an array of 4 antennas, with the desired signal direction of arrival of
   11. from broadside direction. The performance of the wide-band DAS
   beamformer is obtained with simulations in IBM 130-nm CMOS technology.
   Moreover, experimental results for the main building block of the
   circuit, the voltage-mode all-pass filter with the nominal 33 ps delay,
   are given to strengthen the feasibility of physical implementation of

   schemes is analyzed using the method of describing functions. The method
   utilizes a self-evaluating, introspective method with a Cerebellar Model

   functions is measured, and then used to estimate the effect of weight
   updates on reducing the error i.e. estimating a partial derivative. The

   weight updates are no longer beneficial in reducing the average error.

Abstract = {{Constant voltage and frequency can be generated by a Self-Excited
   Induction Generator (SEIG) driven with a fixed-speed low-head
   hydro-turbine when a constant electrical load is maintained by an
   Electronic Load Controller (ELC). In the Conventional-ELC (C-ELC),
   usually a chopper with a dump load is used in parallel with the consumer
   loads to provide regulation of voltage and control of frequency. In the
   C-ELC configuration a high degree of stress can be experienced by stator
   windings and excitation capacitors resulting from chopper operation,
   since in each chopping period the dump load is connected to the stator
   winding for a short period then disconnected. A new ELC topology is
   proposed to reduce this stress. Compared with the C-ELC, the main dump
   load has been divided into two separated parts. A part of the dump load
   can be connected in parallel with the consumer loads, resulting in less
   variation in the total load seen by the SEIG and less stress on the
   stator windings and excitation capacitors. This proposed topology can be
   utilized perphase using bi-directional power switches, hence it can
   operate with unbalanced consumer loads. Simulation results demonstrate
   that even with unbalanced three-phase loads (assisted with
   bi-directional switches per-phase), the proposed topology has the
   capability to regulate voltage from no-load to full load. Moreover, the
   Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) analysis for output (stator) current
   shows a 9\% improvement compared with the most recent results in the
   literature. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Constant voltage and frequency can be generated by a stand-alone
   Self-Excited Induction Generator (SEIG) driven with a fixed-speed
   low-head hydro-turbine when the electrical load is maintained constant
   by an Electronic Load Controller (ELC). In a Conventional-ELC (C-ELC),
   usually a chopper with a dump load is used in parallel with the consumer
   loads to provide regulation of voltage and control of frequency.
   However, in the C-ELC configuration excess generated power may be wasted
   in a dump load. The objective of this research is to design a simplified
   ELC for each household to transfer the excess power for domestic
   consumption in addition to providing voltage regulation. Hence, a new
   ELC topology is proposed. This topology can be split into two parts. The
   first part is a regular ELC of low rated power, which should be
   installed at the generator site and it is responsible for precise
   voltage and frequency regulation and dealing with unexpected failure
   conditions. The second one is a simplified and inexpensive ELC which is
   installed in each household to direct excess power to a low wattage
   household apparatus in addition to participation in voltage regulation
   by maintaining constancy of the load power. This concept is referred to
   here as the Distributed ELC (DELC). One significant advantage of the
   proposed DELC approach is that the excess power can be utilized for
   domestic hot water purposes, and possibly resulting in health benefits
   related to improved sanitation. Moreover, the proposed topology shows
   more reliability compared with the C-ELC. Simulation results demonstrate
   that even with unbalanced three-phase loads (assisted with
   bi-directional switches per-phase), the proposed topology has the
   capability to regulate voltage from no-load to full load. Moreover, in
   the case of a failure in the power switches or the control circuits, the
   DELC has more reliable performance than a C-ELC. (C) 2014 The Authors.

   cognition of fluid flows, enabling users to improve object/fluid
   interactions. This paper presents an approach to extract flow features,
   which can be applied to data of any domain. Our approach uses a
   normalized ``maxima score{''} for predictable output across datasets.
   This score is calculated based on a given point's scalar intensity
   relative to its neighbors. This score can be used to reveal areas of
   interest within the flow field. We present two techniques for
   visualization of the maxima score, one based on isosurfaces and one
   based on edge tracing from image processing. We have successfully
   applied the maxima score approach to synthetic, computational, and

Abstract = {{The following study proposes a two-dimensional large-scale particle
   tracking velocimetry (LS-PTV) system to characterize coherent wind
   structures. Seven minutes of LS-PTV data is collected via an apparatus
   that seeds fog-filled soap bubbles into the wind at a height of 6m from
   the ground. The LS-PTV data is compared to 20 minutes of data collected
   concurrently from a wind mast at the same site. The LS-PTV system
   recorded a mean streamwise velocity of 1.35m/s with a standard deviation
   of 0.23m/s at a mean height of 2.50m with a standard deviation of 0.7m,
   which agrees well with the velocity profile measured by the wind mast.
   Furthermore, the Reynolds stresses measured by the LS-PTV system are
   found to compare to those measured by the wind mast and by Klebanoff
   {[}1] for a canonical turbulent boundary layer. The current study
   assumes that the centre-of-curvature trajectories of the particle
   pathlines are representative of the trajectories followed by the
   spanwise vortices. As a proof-of-principle study, this work has been
   successful in accurately describing the vortex distribution very near to
   the ground. However, the trajectories followed by the
   centres-of-curvature belonging to pathlines concurrently passing through
   the field-of-view were sporadic and uncorrelated.}},

Title = {{Transcutaneous Intraluminal Impedance Measurement for Minimally Invasive
   Monitoring of Gastric Motility: Validation in Acute Canine Models}},
Journal = {{GASTROENTEROLOGY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Transcutaneous intraluminal impedance measurement (TIIM) is a new method
   to cutaneously measure gastric contractions by assessing the attenuation
   dynamics of a small oscillating voltage emitted by a battery-powered
   ingestible capsule retained in the stomach. In the present study, we
   investigated whether TIIM can reliably assess gastric motility in acute
   canine models. Methods. Eight mongrel dogs were randomly divided into 2
   groups: half received an active TIIM pill and half received an
   identically sized sham capsule. After 24-hour fasting and transoral
   administration of the pill (active or sham), two force transducers (FT)
   were sutured onto the antral serosa at laparotomy. After closure, three
   standard cutaneous electrodes were placed on the abdomen, registering
   the transluminally emitted voltage. Thirty-minute baseline recordings
   were followed by pharmacological induction of gastric contractions using
   neostigmine IV and another 30-minute recording. Normalized one-minute
   baseline and postneostigmine gastric motility indices (GMIs) were
   calculated and Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs) between cutaneous
   and FT GMIs were obtained. Statistically significant GMI PCCs were seen
   in both baseline and post-neostigmine states. There were no
   significantGMI PCCs in the shamcapsule test. Further chronic animal
   studies of this novel long-termgastric motility measurement technique
   are needed before testing it on humans.}},

Abstract = {{As patients become more proactive about their health and turn to
   technologies such as the Internet to acquire knowledge, the
   patient-health care professional relationship has been changing.
   Traditionally, information has flowed from health care professional to
   patient, but change to a two-way dialogue is taking place. In this
   study, we examine a high level design of a perceived medical system and
   determine the implications of adding patients as active contributors.
   The main challenge of modifying existing systems to incorporate patient
   interaction is preserving system integrity. We propose a systematic
   approach to support scaling health care systems while preserving system
   integrity. Distributed systems such as personal health records and
   eHealth systems provide two ways in which patients can become more
   involved with their own health care with or without the involvement of
   health care professionals. It is important that modifications to such
   systems do not compromise patient record integrity regardless of whether
   the patient is working alone or with their health care professional. The
   lack of central control in distributed systems added to the complexity
   of health systems poses challenges for design and modification. Of
   particular interest is the identification of emergent behavior (behavior
   not explicitly specified in the specifications) in distributed systems
   not explicitly defined in the requirements of its individual components.
   Use of the new emergent behavior detection (EBD) tool offers potentially
   considerable cost savings by proactively identifying such behaviors
   during the design rather than the deployment phase of a project. Based
   on high level message sequence charts, the EBD tool highlighted a data
   synchronization issue between the main database and the patient's
   interface to the system. This provides valuable feedback of the early
   health system design which benefits future design development.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in retinal vessel width can be indicative of the presence of
   several diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of

   ROP. We present image processing methods for detection, tracking, and
   measurement of the width of the major temporal arcade (MTA), which is
   the thickest branch of the venular vessels, in retinal fundus images of
   preterm infants. The methods include the use of Gabor filters for the
   detection of the blood vessels, as well as morphological image
   processing for tracking and measurement of the width of the MTA. The
   results indicate a statistically significant difference in vessel width

Abstract = {{Road accident is a disaster that vocalizes a major cause of disability,

   decision tree to generate the road accident rules applying the discrete
   and continuous data stored in accident databases. Among all critical
   factors in the occurrence of traffic accidents, environmental factors
   and road design (geometry) are considered in this study. This method
   establishes an optimized fuzzy granular decision tree with the minimum
   redundancy and road accident severity classification using fuzzy
   reasoning. California highways were considered as the case study to
   examine the proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate that
   the proposed method is approximately 16\% more accurate than the fuzzy
   ID3 method with less redundancy in constructing the decision tree.}},

Abstract = {{In this research we utilize PARAMICS traffic micro-simulation software
   to study the impact of deploying Connected Vehicles (CV) in Deerfoot
   trail, Calgary, Alberta. We have implemented a V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle)
   Assisted V2I (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure) system for PARAMICS. It uses
   Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) protocol to acquire traffic
   data, calculate and compare important traffic safety and mobility
   parameters and their impacts on CV by testing five scenarios
   differentiated by the percentage of 0\% to 40\% market penetration of
   CVs. Despite of previous studies which focused on upstream traffic, in
   this study we demonstrate effect of considering DSRC, re-routing
   guidance and advisory speed for upstream and downstream traffic. The
   study demonstrated that the CV technology can enhance traffic safety and
   mobility in freeways, if the percentage of CVs is significant (e.g.
   30-40\%) and the CV technology is accompanied by advisory speed
   reflected on Variable Message Signs (VMS) on both upstream and
   downstream of the incident location using DSRC range. In other words,
   equipping freeways with VMS, to use V2I communication, complements the
   CV technology, improves CV efficiency and leads to higher safety and
   mobility enhancement in freeways.}},

Abstract = {{Focal plane arrays (FPAs) find applications in dish-antenna based
   receivers having multiple wideband beams. Such beams have a plurality of
   off-axes directions from the main beam. Maximally-decimated multirate
   3-D digital FIR frustum filterbank can be employed in an FPA receiver to
   reduce directional jamming/clutter and other interference, noise, mutual
   electromagnetic coupling effects, and out-of-system noise/interference
   from warm bodies close to the antenna. A 3-D frustum filter requires
   high arithmetic complexity in the DSP hardware and sophisticated
   wide-band RF-front ends featuring high dynamic range. The temporal
   channelization of FPA elements using microwave triplexers achieves
   frequency channelization in continuous-time. Channelization is moved
   before the LNA stage, thereby allowing considerable improvement in
   dynamic range requirements for the RF-front end. The channelization
   reduces LNA bandwidth for each channel. The signals within the microwave
   channelizer sub-bands can either be down-converted through mixers, or
   directly sub-sampled by means of bandpass sampling A/D converters.
   Integration of multi-dimensional signal processing theory -which,
   traditionally is built around DSP methods - with microwave engineering,
   yields mixed-mode microwave-digital realizations of 3-D frustum filters
   having applications in FPA receivers. Simulation results of 3-D
   microwave-digital FIR mixed-domain three-channel frustum filters show
   SNR improvement of 21.5 dB and SIR improvement for 24.2 dB, for wideband
   applications in the range 1-4 GHz using an FPA having 32 x 32 elements
   with a dish of aperture 5m and focal length 7m.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes the development of a quantitative method for
   computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of intervertebral disc degeneration
   according to Pfirrmann's scale, a semiquantitative scale with five
   degrees of degeneration, in T2-weighted magnetic resonance images of the
   lumbar spine. The dataset consists of images of 210 discs obtained from
   42 healthy individuals. The intervertebral discs were assigned
   Pfirrmann's grades based on independent and blind classification. Binary
   masks of manually segmented discs were used to compute the centroids of
   the regions, estimate the curvature of the spine by polynomial fitting,
   normalize intensities, and extract regions of interest. Texture analysis
   was performed using Haralick's features and moments were computed for
   each disc. Classification was performed using an artificial neural
   network using the full vectors of attributes as well as a reduced set
   obtained using gradient ascent search. An average true-positive rate of
   75.2\% and an average area under the receiver operating characteristic
   curve of 0.78 indicate potential application of this technique for CAD
   of spinal pathology.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Although a blood analog of aqueous glycerol and xanthan gum
   was found to replicate the viscoelastic behavior of blood, measurements
   were restricted to laminar flow.
   OBJECTIVE: To expand the characterization of a non-Newtonian blood
   analog of aqueous glycerol and xanthan gum to transitional Reynolds
   numbers to quantify its behavior as a function of both natural and
   shear-layer-induced mechanisms.
   METHODS: A Newtonian analog and a shear-thinning aqueous glycerol,
   xanthan gum solution were circulated through an in vitro flow loop
   replicating both a straight and obstructed artery where transition was
   initiated through natural and shear-layer-induced mechanisms
   respectively. Steady and pulsatile pressure drop measurements for both
   fluids were acquired across a range of Reynolds numbers up to 7600 and
   Womersley numbers of 4 and 6.
   RESULTS: In steady and pulsatile straight flow, the non-Newtonian analog
   presented with reduced pressure drops and prolonged laminar flow to
   Reynolds numbers of 3200 and 3800 respectively. Upon blockage inclusion,
   non-Newtonian minor losses were comparable to Newtonian in steady flow
   and greater in pulsatile flow suggesting an elongation of downstream
   non-Newtonian recirculation. Although non-Newtonian total system
   pressure drops in both straight and obstructed flows were lower, the
   ratio of pressure drop difference between the two fluids decreased
   through shear-layer-induced transition.
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings not only demonstrated the suitability of
   using a xanthan gum analog to model blood flow in transitional regimes,
   but also presented the respective differences in analog behavior as a
   function of transition mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{The proton transport property of Nafion nanothin films (4-300 nm) has
   been investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) using
   interdigitated array (IDA) of gold electrodes on SiO2 substrate. The
   proton conductivity has been investigated as a function of film
   drying/heating protocol, relative humidity, temperature and film
   thickness. It is found that the film treatment protocol makes a
   difference in film transport property. Ultimately, the proton
   conductivity and capacitance of the Nafion nanothin film is
   thickness-dependent, where the former decreased and the latter increased
   exponentially with decreasing film thickness. Moreover, the activation
   energy increased exponentially with decreasing film thickness. The
   proton conductivity of the thin films of Nafion is significantly lower
   than that of the membrane counterpart regardless of the thickness, which
   is consistent with the high activation energy found in the thin films.
   These differences are likely related to the polymer confinement and
   morphological differences between the thin films and the freestanding
   membrane. (C) The Author(s) 2014. Published by ECS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the utility of multimodal feedback during
   telesurgery to notify surgeons of excessive force application. Average
   puncture forces were characterized for varied thicknesses of an
   artificial membrane, and human operators then attempted to apply a
   maximum force to the membranes without causing a puncture via an
   experimental telesurgical apparatus. Operators were notified via
   different sensory modalities when the force exerted by the tool-tip
   exceeded a pre-established force margin, defined as a set percentage of
   the average puncture force. Various combinations of auditory and
   vibrotactile notifications both with and without force feedback were
   compared in order to investigate the relationship between feedback
   modality, force margin, and puncture force. Factor screening results
   identify multiple two-factor interactions as having statistically
   significant effects on both the maximum applied force and task
   completion time, warranting further investigation. Notifications of any
   type decreased both response variables for operators who relied on them.}},

Abstract = {{Spurious intermodulation components have recently been identified as a
   major problem in carrier aggregation mobile transmitters with multi-band
   power amplifiers (PAs). This article presents novel adaptive digital
   predistortion (DPD) solutions with reduced complexity in both the
   predistortion processing and the feedback paths, to tackle this problem.
   Compared with conventional DPDs which aim to linearize the whole
   transmit bandwidth, the proposed technique aims at mitigating only those
   intermodulation components which are most problematic from the spurious
   emission limit perspective. The proposed technique is verified with
   extensive simulations in various 3GPP LTE-A carrier aggregation
   scenarios, showing that the intermodulation spurs can be efficiently
   mitigated below the spurious emission limit with relatively small
   back-offs.}},

   displaying wide dynamic range images with good brightness. Our algorithm
   embeds an automatic computation of the key parameter controlling the

   of WDR images. This enables to prevent unnecessary or cumbersome manual
   tuning of parameters as often found in tone mapping algorithms.
   Experimental results performed on different WDR images show that we are
   able to get images which are visually pleasant and which have good
   brightness and contrast. The good performance of our algorithm is also
   confirmed numerically through the use of the tone mapping quality index

Abstract = {{In September 2009, the City Council of Calgary, Canada, approved Plan It
   Calgary, which proposed policies that focused on the development of
   resilient neighborhoods through the intensification and diversification
   of urban activities around transit stations and routes. More intensive
   development and mixed land use encourage nonmotorized trips and
   reinforce comfortable, safe, and walkable streets. The development of
   high-density, mixed-use, and transit- and pedestrian-oriented
   communities has the potential to generate shorter trips to destinations;
   these trips are expected to result in a higher share of active travel
   modes, such as biking and walking. Thus, there is a growing need to
   estimate the impact of land use development scenarios and transportation
   policies on bicycle and pedestrian demand to predict nonmotorized trip
   volumes and design the related infrastructure adequately. In this study,
   on the basis of multiple linear and Poisson regression models were
   calibrated to estimate nonmotorized travel demand on the basis of
   geographic information system data, transportation services, and road
   characteristics. The empirical models developed in this research can be
   used to assess the impacts of urban design and built environments, such
   as development of high-density and mixed land use areas, of complete
   street construction in the middle ring communities of Calgary, and of
   influenced demand for active travel modes. The developed models also
   show the benefits of improved pedestrian infrastructure, such as
   improved network connectivity and increases in the length of pedestrian
   pathways, as well as the benefits of the integration of transit and
   walking modes and transit and bicycle modes in encouraging more
   nonmotorized travel demand. This method is a straightforward statistical
   analysis for practitioners, and the needed data are relatively easy to
   access.}},

Abstract = {{Iceberg monitoring is an important application of synthetic aperture
   radar (SAR), and is one of the stated objectives of the Radarsat
   Constellation, the next generation of Canada's Radarsat satellites. In
   this paper, we simulate Radarsat Constellation data in a number of
   different imaging modes, using Radarsat-2 single-look complex data
   covering a study area in the Labrador Sea. We test the iceberg detection
   performance of both linear dual-pol data as well as compact polarimetry,
   a novel SAR architecture that transmits circular polarization rather
   than the traditional horizontal or vertical polarizations. We use the
   likelihood ratio test method to calculate a decision variable image for
   each of a number of different dual-pol and compact configurations, then
   analyze the detection performance using 25 validated iceberg locations
   spread across 12 different scenes. We found that compared to the linear
   data, the compact data missed fewer targets, and detected a greater
   number of pixels of detected targets, for most of the incidence angles
   and imaging modes tested. Compact polarimetry seems to be a promising
   choice for iceberg detection applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this research paper we modeled a DPS when the firm's capacity is
   limited and a due-date guarantee may be required or favored by some
   customers. We suggest a promising approach to integrate a two-tier
   one-of-a-kind production supply chain with no dominant tier. We
   formulated a dynamic Bellman model to compute the optimal price quotes.
   By comparing DPS with SPS and analyzing the computational complexity of
   the proposed dynamic method, we show that when the firm dynamically
   changes the prices for each type of orders, both the firm and the
   customers are better off. This finding strongly supports the superiority
   of DPS. In the introduction of the future work, we also propose the OKP
   whole production supply chain model's optimal targets.}},

Abstract = {{Performance study of gas oil gravity drainage in stacks of overwhelmed
   blocks in a gas-invaded zone of naturally fractured reservoirs presents
   difficult challenges to petroleum engineers. It is believed that there
   exists some degree of block-to-block interaction that may lead to
   capillary continuity in fractured reservoirs. Effect of such continuity
   in gravity drainage is much more pronounced as it increases the height
   of the continuous fluid column in a reservoir and thereby the recovery
   of oil as height is a key parameter in gravity drainage mechanisms. It
   has been experimentally proven that liquid or solid bridges in
   horizontal fracture can contribute to wetting phase transfer across the
   horizontal fracture, but there is no mathematical model that predicts
   the probability of such continuity. In this article, a mathematical
   model developed by using 1-D Navier-Stock for the free surface flow
   equation and Young-Laplace of capillary for breakage of the stable
   liquid bridge held between two pairs of support while stretching. The
   model gives critical length of fracture aperture, which surely provides
   capillary continuity. Moreover, the developed model shows flow
   dependency of fracture capillary pressure and predicts a nonzero value
   for this parameter, while in the past many researchers used zero
   fracture capillary pressure for history matching of fractured
   reservoirs.}},

Abstract = {{The current study examines the capabilities of large-scale particle
   tracking velocimetry (LS-PTV) in fully resolving the wake behind a
   wind-loaded structure. LS-PTV measurements within a 16m(3) volume were
   acquired behind a 0.75m diameter sphere. The study uses a spherical
   obstruction as a base case to prove the feasibility of measuring
   wind-turbine wakes. The Reynolds number of the flow was approximately
   R-e = 1 x 10(5). The temporal longevity of paths increased at a rate of
   0.0073D/U-0 per sphere diameter, indicating that the seeding particles
   have the ability to withstand the shear forces present in the wake.
   Furthermore, the mean freestream- velocity deficit profiles, the
   streamwise Reynolds stress profile, and the wake-deficit decay obtained
   using the LS-PTV system agreed with studies performed by Amoura et al.
   {[}1] and Eames et al. {[}2], thereby demonstrating the system's ability
   to accurately quantify the mean flow. Finally, steady-flow, ramp-up and
   ramp-down events were identified within the data from the time trace of
   the freestream flow. The corresponding wake structures behind the sphere
   during the three events were characterized using the realtime spatial
   measurements achievable by the LS-PTV system. During steady-flow
   conditions, pathlines exhibited high mixing and high curvature within
   one diameter downstream of the sphere, whereas pathlines further
   downstream were comparatively straight. In contrast, the straightening
   of pathlines occurred further upstream during ramp-up and ramp-down
   events, indicating that high freestream- velocity events such as gusts
   have an organizing effect on the wake, which attenuates shedding
   structures.}},

Abstract = {{The optimal power flow problem (OPF) has been of importance to power
   system operators for many decades. Being able to quickly determine
   optimal operating points and analyzing larger networks can lead to
   advantages for operators from reliability, stability, cost and market
   fairness perspectives. This work aims at achieving those ends by solving
   OPF problems by utilizing hardware acceleration capabilities of
   graphical processing units (GPUs). At present, nearly all desktop and
   laptop computers ship with general-purpose GPUs that can be harnessed to
   accelerate analysis. This work will present important concepts regarding
   effective use of GPUs as it pertains to OPF problems and illustrate the
   types of problems that stand to benefit most from their use. The
   benefits of GPU acceleration are demonstrated by implementing a
   predictor-corrector interior-point method with the majority of the
   computation offloaded onto a GPU. Experiments are used to validate the
   developments by analyzing well-known power systems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents design of a tri-band Doherty power amplifier
   operating at frequencies of 1.6 GHz, 1.9 GHz and 2.2 GHz. The circuit
   utilizes two 10 W GaN HEMT transistors in a symmetric Doherty power
   amplifier configuration. A peak drain efficiency of more than 60\% is
   achieved in measurement at each frequency of operation. At 6 dB output
   power back-off, the measured drain efficiency is more than 45\% at 1.6
   GHz, 2.2 GHz and better than 38.2\% at 1.9 GHz. In comparison to the
   balanced mode operation, this corresponds to an improvement of 19.7\%,
   10.4 \% and 16.7\% in the drain efficiency achieved at 1.6 GHz, 1.9 GHz
   and 2.2 GHz respectively. The ratio of Carrier to third order
   intermodulation distortion is better that 18 dBc at saturation for all

Abstract = {{A robust and low sampling rate digital predistortion (DPD) algorithm for
   broadband power amplifiers (PAs) is proposed in this paper. To alleviate
   the burden on the sampling rate, an approximated model extracted by
   bandlimited signals is employed to approach the broadband behavior. Due
   to the assistance of the low pass filter (LPF) in the feedback loop and
   the adaptive basis function scheme, the sampling rate can be reduced
   drastically and the algorithm is more robust. Experimental results show
   that more than 21 dB adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) improvement is
   achieved for 60MHz 3-carrier LTE signal application only with 92.16Msps
   sampling rate, and the cavity RF filter in the feedback loop is not
   necessary any more.}},

Abstract = {{Boundary collisions are motor accidents which occur on the boundaries of
   areal units. In some areas, boundary collisions may account for a large
   proportion of the total collisions. Generally, it is a critical step to
   aggregate boundary collisions into areal units before collision
   analysis. Exaggerated or underestimated aggregation results may hamper
   traffic safety analysis and management. In this paper, we propose a
   boundary collision aggregation approach based on the collision density
   ratio. The proposed method is compared with two other boundary collision
   aggregation methods. Two regions (downtown region and south region) in
   City of Edmonton are selected as the study area. The assessment result
   shows that the proposed method outperforms the other two methods.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing the flexibility in spectrum access is a key to enhanced
   efficiency in radio spectrum utilization. Noncontiguous carrier
   aggregation (CA) is one enabling technology towards more flexible
   spectrum access, but can also lead to serious implementation challenges
   in terms of transmitter linearity. Especially when a single power
   amplifier (PA) is deployed for all carriers, serious intermodulation
   components will rise which can easily limit the maximum transmit power.
   In this paper, a low-complexity digital predistortion (DPD) solution is
   developed to reduce the most critical spurious components at the PA
   output, opposed to more classical full bandwidth linearization. The
   developed concept and associated parameter learning and optimization are
   particularly tailored towards mobile devices, building on limited
   narrowband feedback receiver with reduced instrumentation complexity and
   reduced-rate DPD processing. The developed DPD solution can handle PAs
   with substantial memory effects, and is verified with extensive
   simulation examples in various non-contiguous carrier aggregation
   scenarios and practical PA models with memory.}},

   constrained to meet 100\% of the energy demand. An optimal design is
   found to minimize the cost of energy supply over a 20 year lifespan. The
   optimal design is analysed with respect to technology cost and

Abstract = {{Geospatial clustering is an important topic in spatial analysis and
   knowledge discovery research. However, most existing clustering methods
   clusters geospatial data at data level without considering domain
   knowledge and users' goals during the clustering process. In this paper,
   we propose an ontology-based geospatial cluster ensemble approach to
   produce good clustering results with the consideration of domain
   knowledge and users' goals. The approach includes two components: an
   ontology-based expert system and a cluster ensemble method. The
   ontology-based expert system is to represent geospatial and clustering
   domain knowledge and to identify the appropriate clustering components
   (e.g., geospatial datasets, attributes of the datasets, and clustering
   methods) based on a specific application requirement. The cluster
   ensemble is to combine a diverse set of clustering results produced by
   recommended clustering components into an optimal clustering result. A
   real case study has been conducted to demonstrate the efficiency and
   practicality of the approach.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical sensors based on micro/nanoelectromechanical systems (M/NEMS)
   offer many advantages. However, obtaining chemical selectivity in M/NEMS
   sensors using chemoselective interfaces has been a longstanding
   challenge. Despite their many advantages, M/NEMS devices relying on
   chemoselective interfaces do not have sufficient selectivity. Therefore,
   highly sensitive and selective detection and quantification of chemical
   molecules using real-time, miniature sensor platforms still remains as a
   crucial challenge. Incorporating photothermal/photoacoustic
   spectroscopic techniques with M/NEMS using quantum cascade lasers can
   provide the chemical selectivity without sacrificing the sensitivity of
   the miniaturized sensing system. Point sensing is defined as sensing
   that requires collection and delivery of the target molecules to the
   sensor for detection and analysis. For example, photothermal cantilever
   deflection spectroscopy, which combines the high thermomechanical
   sensitivity of a bimetallic microcantilever with high selectivity of the
   mid infrared (IR) spectroscopy, is capable of obtaining molecular
   signatures of extremely small quantities of adsorbed explosive molecules
   (tens of picogram). On the other hand, standoff sensing is defined as
   sensing where the sensor and the operator are at distance from the
   target samples. Therefore, the standoff sensing is a non-contact method
   of obtaining molecular signatures without sample collection and
   processing. The distance of detection depends on the power of IR source,
   the sensitivity of a detector, and the efficiency of the collecting
   optics. By employing broadly tunable, high power quantum cascade lasers
   and a boxcar averager, molecular recognition of trace explosive
   compounds (1 mu g/cm(2) of RDX) on a stainless steel surface has been
   achieved at a distance of five meters.}},

Abstract = {{Precise point positioning real-time kinematic (PPP-RTK) can achieve fast
   ambiguity resolution and precise positioning with the satellite
   fractional cycle biases (FCBs) and atmospheric correction derived from a
   dense regional reference network. However, the interpolated atmospheric
   corrections based on a sparse reference network with inter-station
   distances of more than 100 km are not precise enough to facilitate
   reliable PPP ambiguity resolution. In this contribution, a new method is
   proposed for fast PPP ambiguity resolution within a sparse regional
   reference network. First, code biases, FCBs, biased ionospheric and
   tropospheric delays at the reference stations are estimated with known
   positioning using the regional sparse reference network data. Then, the
   biased ionospheric and tropospheric corrections at a user station are
   generated using a distance-based linear interpolation of the ionospheric
   and tropospheric delays available at the reference stations. To
   strengthen the observation model, the interpolated ionospheric and
   tropospheric delays derived from the sparse network are all considered
   as pseudo-observations with a given variance-covariance matrix which
   will be adaptively estimated according to the reference network density
   to describe the level of the constraint strength. To get a realistic
   constraint variance, atmospheric constraint variance is estimated with a
   certain window length. By a proper tuning of the variance-covariance
   matrix applied for the atmospheric pseudo-observations, the method can
   adapt any scale of the regional reference network. The ambiguity fixing
   performance and the resulted position accuracy are assessed with medium
   and large reference networks. The validation confirms that the new
   strategy can fix ambiguity within 1 min for a medium network and within
   7 min for a larger network while provide centimeter-level positioning
   solution ambiguity with 20.8 s for a medium network and within 71.9 s
   for a larger network.}},

Abstract = {{Data on population at building level is required for various purposes.
   However, to protect privacy, government population data is aggregated.
   Population estimates at finer scales can be obtained through areal
   interpolation, a process where data from a first spatial unit system is
   transferred to another system. Areal interpolation can be conducted with
   ancillary data that guide the redistribution of population. For
   population estimation at the building level, common ancillary data
   include three-dimensional data on buildings, obtained through costly
   processes such as LiDAR. Meanwhile, volunteered geographic information
   (VGI) is emerging as a new category of data and is already used for
   purposes related to urban management. The objective of this paper is to
   present an alternative approach for building level areal interpolation
   that uses VGI as ancillary data. The proposed method integrates existing
   interpolation techniques, i.e., multi-class dasymetric mapping and
   interpolation by surface volume integration; data on building footprints
   and points-of-interest (POIs) extracted from OpenStreetMap (OSM) are
   used to refine population estimates at building level. A case study was
   conducted for the city of Hamburg and the results were compared using
   different types of POIs. The results suggest that VGI can be used to
   accurately estimate population distribution, but that further research
   is needed to understand how POIs can reveal population distribution
   patterns.}},

   we extend this univariate model to the multivariate case, the objective
   being the sample covariance matrix pdf estimation of multilook

   texture distribution as the Laguerre expansion of the gamma
   distribution, we derive this pdf, which is a generalized form of the
   well-known multivariate K-distribution. The resulting distributions are
   assessed quantitatively with respect to multilook fully polarimetric
   L-band SAR image data from which we conclude that the proposed pdf

   characteristics, such as constant current discharge, cell capacity and
   internal resistance, were performed. From these discharge measurements,
   the nano-sized particle-based cathode (nano-sized MnO2/Vulcan carbon)
   discharge capacity was found to be 303 mA h g(-1), which is 128\% higher
   than the maximum value of the bulk MnO2 counterpart-based cathodes (bulk
   MnO2/Vulcan carbon). In addition, the internal resistance of the
   nanosized MnO2/Vulcan carbon cathode-based cell appeared to be very low
   compared to that of all other bulk cathodes. Our results show that the
   configuration of nanoparticle-based cathode cells allows them to exhibit
   superior discharge capacity retention and increased shelf life compared
   to the conventional Zn/MnO2 cathode cells.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the multiple attribute decision making
   problems in which the attribute weights are usually correlative,
   attribute values take the form of linguistic variables, some new methods
   are developed. Then a new aggregation operator called induced
   generalized 2-tuple linguistic choquet ordered averaging ( IG-2TCOA)
   operator is proposed, and some desirable properties of the IG-2TCOA
   operator are studied, such as idempotent, commutative, monotonic and
   bounded. An IG-2TCOA operators-based approach is developed to solve the
   MADM problems. Finally, an illustrative example for evaluating the
   performance of the mechanical products is given to verify the developed
   approach and to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{We have developed a simple mechanism incorporating feedline bends and
   rotary joints to enable motion of a monopole antenna within a
   liquid-based illumination chamber for tomographic imaging. The monopole
   is particularly well suited for this scenario because of its small size
   and simplicity. For the application presented here a full set of
   measurement data is collected from most illumination and receive
   directions utilizing only a pair of antennas configured with the
   rotating fixture underneath the imaging tank. Alternatively, the concept
   can be adapted for feed structures entering the tank from the sides to
   allow for measurements with vertically and horizontally polarized
   antennas. This opens the door for more advanced imaging applications
   where anisotropy could play an important role such as in bone imaging.}},

Abstract = {{The tracking threshold in conventional scalar-based GNSS receivers
   limits the performance of ML bit decoding, which is paramount to ML
   based bit wipe-off In this paper, a standalone approach, that is, in the
   absence of aiding information, is proposed for the ultratightly coupled
   high sensitivity GNSS receiver. The benefits are analyzed and determined
   of using ultratightly coupled GNSS receiver in the standalone mode to
   improve bit decoding and navigation solutions.
   The results show the ultra-tight receiver is more robust than the
   GNSS-only receivers. In the context of GPS L1 C/A signals, the field
   test results show ultra-tight receiver can improve the successful
   decoding rate (SDR) compared to scalar-based receiver. Compared to the
   vector-based receiver, the ultra-tight receiver is more immune to the
   high BER problem in extending coherent integration time. The position
   and velocity accuracy of the standalone ultra-tight receiver has been
   improved more than 40\% after extending coherent integration time in the
   vehicular navigation test in urban canyon. A newly proposed signal power
   based update observation selection strategy has helped to mitigate
   multipath impacts.}},

Abstract = {{Free-form surfaces are widely used in many applications in today's
   industry. This paper presents a new approach to identify and compensate
   process-related errors in machining of free-form surfaces. The
   process-related errors are identified online by a newly developed
   in-process inspection technique. In this technique, the surface is first
   machined through an intermediate semi-finishing process that is
   specifically designed to machine different geometric shapes on the
   surface with different process parameters. An inspection method is
   developed to identify the process-related errors in the selected regions
   on the semi-finished surface. The relationship between the
   machining/surface parameters and process-related error is then achieved
   using a neural network. This relationship is used to predict the
   process-related errors in the finishing process. The process-related
   errors, together with the machine tool geometric errors identified using
   a method developed in our previous work, are compensated in the
   finishing tool paths through tool path re-planning. Experiment has been
   conducted to machine a part with a free-form surface to show the
   improvements in the machining accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, three stabilized finite volume iterative schemes for the
   stationary Navier-Stokes equations are considered. Under the finite
   volume discretization at each iterative step, the iterative scheme I
   consists in solving the steady Stokes problem, iterative scheme II
   consists in solving the stationary linearized Navier-Stokes equations
   and iterative scheme III consists in solving the steady Oseen equations,
   respectively. We discuss the stabilities and convergence of three
   iterative methods. The iterative schemes I and II are stable and
   convergent under some strong uniqueness conditions, while iterative
   scheme III is unconditionally stable and convergent under the uniqueness
   condition. Finally, some numerical results are presented to verify the
   performance of these iterative schemes.}},

Title = {{Modeling Riders' Behavioral Responses to Real-Time Information at Light
   Rail Transit Stations}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2412}},
Pages = {{82-92}},
Abstract = {{An advanced passenger information system (APIS) can play a significant
   role in improving the satisfaction of transit riders in the short term
   and increasing ridership in the long term. This research focuses on
   investigating riders' behavioral responses to en route real-time
   information on light rail transit (LRT). A survey was designed and
   conducted to collect LRT riders' behavioral responses by presenting
   hypothetical scenarios in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Two scenarios were
   examined: an estimated arrival time of 10 min for the next LRT and an
   LRT service interruption attributable to an incident or weather with no
   information on expected recovery time. The survey collected 505
   responses. Four multinomial logit models were developed and calibrated
   to explore the factors affecting trip decision making for the described
   scenarios for commuter and noncommuter trips. The results led to the
   conclusion that various socioeconomic attributes (e.g., age, gender, and
   number of autos per household), experience with an APIS (familiarity
   with APIS and perceived accuracy of APIS), and experience with transit
   and the LRT system (use of transit as the primary mode of
   transportation, frequency of LRT use, and familiarity with LRT) had
   strong influences on travelers' behavioral responses in the context of
   real-time LRT information. Analysis of the data also determined that
   travelers' actions varied by trip purposes, travel time, and weather
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In this research work, the transient liquid phase (TLP) bonding process
   was utilized to fabricate joints using thin (20 m) nickel and copper
   foils placed between two bonding surfaces to help facilitate joint
   formation. Two joint configurations were investigated, first,
   Ti-6Al-4V/CuNi/Mg-AZ31 and second, Ti-6Al-4V/NiCu/Mg-AZ31. The effect of
   bonding time on microstructural developments across the joint and the
   changes in mechanical properties were studied as a function of bonding
   temperature and pressure. The bonded specimens were examined by
   metallographic analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray
   diffraction (XRD). In both cases, intermetallic phase of CuMg2 and
   Mg3AlNi2 was observed inside the joint region. The results show that
   joint shear strengths for the Ti-6Al-4V/CuNi/Mg-AZ31 setup produce
   joints with shear strength of 57 MPa compared to 27MPa for joints made
   using the Ti-6Al-4V/NiCu/Mg-AZ31 layer arrangement.}},

Abstract = {{Thermally sprayed coatings developed by use of high velocity oxy-fuel
   (HVOF) process are known for their superior wear characteristics. In
   many industrial applications, new parts as well as repaired and
   refurbished parts coated with WC-Co microstructured coatings have shown
   enhanced erosion-corrosion and abrasive resistant properties when
   compared with other surface modification technologies such as chrome
   replacement, fusion welding, and cladding. This research has been
   further directed towards the development of HVOF technique to deposit
   dense nanostructured ceramic-metallic composites. The mechanism of
   plastic deformation, which determines the strength and ductility of
   materials, in nanostructured materials are different, thereby leading to
   novel mechanical properties. Various parameters can influence these
   properties, but the substrate surface preparation by grit blasting
   before thermal spraying is one critical parameter. The grit blasting
   process generates a surface roughness, which ensures mechanical
   anchoring between the coating and the substrate surface. In this work,
   the sliding wear behavior and microhardness of WC-17wt.\% Ni(80/20)Cr
   cermet coatings deposited onto carbon steel substrates are examined as a
   function of three different surface roughness values under different
   loads. The results show that as-prepared surface with different blasting
   profiles have a direct influence on the surface roughness and wear
   performance of the coatings. The sliding wear resistance of the coatings
   increased as the substrate surface roughness increased. The wear depth
   decreased with increasing surface roughness.}},

Title = {{Quantitative Properties From Drill Cuttings To Improve the Design of
   Hydraulic-Fracturing Jobs in Horizontal Wells}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CANADIAN PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{53}},

Abstract = {{The study proposes a method for quantitative determination of porosity,
   permeability, and rock-mechanics properties from drill cuttings of at
   least 1 mm. The porosity value is used for determining a brittleness
   index by implementing sonic-derived porosity theory and a dipole sonic
   log from an offset well.
   A new parameter is introduced in this work to give a quantitative value
   to microscopic observations related to natural-fracture features in
   drill cuttings. It is called ``frac value{''} and in conjunction with
   the brittleness index and permeability constitutes the main result of
   the methodology: the cut log.
   Quantitative data extracted from drill cuttings are important because
   the amount of information collected in horizontal wells drilled through
   tight formations, including cores and well logs, is rather limited in
   most instances. This paper is based on a Canadian case study with
   implications for selecting optimum intervals for hydraulic fracturing in
   a tight gas reservoir. However, the method should also be suitable for
   global applications in all types of reservoirs (unconventional and
   conventional) where good-quality drill cuttings might be available.
   Data extracted from the previous steps are useful for multistage
   hydraulic-fracturing 3D simulation of horizontal wells. This provides
   additional information to stimulation designers for deciding where to
   initiate hydraulic fractures and how to optimize fracture spacing and
   fracture size per stage instead of considering a homogeneous reservoir
   volume throughout the whole lateral section.
   It is concluded that the proposed method provides a useful tool for
   evaluation of direct sources of information that are available in many
   cases (drill cuttings) but are rarely evaluated quantitatively. The
   proposed method allows improved design of multistage
   hydraulic-fracturing jobs in horizontal wells.}},

Title = {{Modelling of Bitumen-and-Solvent-Mixture Viscosity Data Using
   Thermodynamic Perturbation Theory}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CANADIAN PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Viscosity is an important transport property for engineering design and
   simulation of bitumen production and transportation. During the
   production of bitumen with solvent injection, steam-assisted gravity
   drainage, or expanding solvent steam-assisted gravity drainage, the
   oil/solvent mixture encounters various temperature and pressure
   conditions. Therefore, a model is necessary to predict the viscosity of
   the mixture of bitumen and solvent in wide ranges of temperatures,
   pressures, and compositions (T-P-x).
   In this work, we propose a semitheoretical viscosity model based on the
   Arrhenius mixing rule and considering the effect of association between
   the molecules of the solvent and the bitumen. To achieve this purpose,
   thermodynamic perturbation theory (TPT) is used to calculate the
   fraction of bonding solvent molecules. We calculate the viscosity of the
   solvent in wide temperature and pressure ranges using the modified
   Enskog theory (MET).
   Results show an acceptable agreement between the predictions of this
   model and experimental viscosity data of bitumen saturated with
   different solvents (CH4, N-2, CO2, and C2H6) at various T-P-x ranges.
   These experimental data cover the typical T-P-x ranges of oil-recovery
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{This paper surveys the recent findings in the area of energy efficient
   radio resource management in cellular networks. The primary objective is
   to identify and evaluate the key techniques that have the highest energy

   paper is targeted towards multicell networks which are composed of
   multiple BSs co-existing in the same area sharing the available radio
   resources. Due to this, greater emphasis is given towards the techniques
   that take inter-cell interference (ICI) into account while allocating
   the resources and, in the process, maximize the energy efficiency (EE).
   The resource management solutions presented in the paper are classified
   under three network domains namely homogeneous, heterogeneous, and
   cooperative networks. Furthermore, the analytical techniques for
   characterizing the EE of multicell networks are discussed in terms of
   the stochastic geometry framework. Finally, the paper outlines the

Abstract = {{Traditionally, traffic monitoring requires data from traffic cameras,
   loop detectors, or probe vehicles that are usually operated by dedicated
   employees. In efforts to reduce the capital and operational costs
   associated with traffic monitoring, departments of transportation have
   explored the feasibility of using global positioning system (GPS) data
   loggers on their probe vehicles that are postprocessed for analyzing the
   traffic patterns on desired routes. Furthermore, most cell phones are
   equipped with embedded assisted-GPS (AGPS) chips, and if the mode of
   transportation the phone is in can be anonymously identified, the phones
   can be treated as if they are probe vehicles that are voluntarily
   hovering throughout the city, at minimal additional costs. Emerging cell
   phones known as ``smartphones{''} are equipped with additional sensors
   including an accelerometer and magnetometer. The accelerometer can
   directly measure the acceleration values, as opposed to having
   acceleration values derived from speed values in conventional GPS
   sensors. The magnetometer can measure mode-specific electromagnetic
   levels. Smartphones are subscribed with roadside Internet data plans
   that can provide an essential platform for real-time traffic monitoring.
   In this article, neural network-based artificial intelligence is used to
   identify the mode of transportation by detecting the patterns of
   distinct physical profile of each mode that consists of speed,
   acceleration, number of satellites in view, and electromagnetic levels.
   Results show that newly available values in smartphones improve the mode
   detection rates when compared with using conventional GPS data loggers.
   When smartphones are in known orientations, they can provide
   three-dimensional (3-D) acceleration values that can further improve
   mode detection accuracies.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduced the Delaunay triangulation network
   generating algorithm-incremental insertion-in detail. Then, we improved
   the most crucial steps of the algorithm via two aspects. The first one
   is to locate the point position by leveraging quad tree index and
   direction searching technique. The second one is to handle the initial
   network generation and the point insertion process by inserting points
   into the triangulation network from both internal and external of the
   convex hull. The experiment shows that the position method not only can
   accelerate the network generating, but also independent of the total
   amount of the point set; and the approach that insert points from
   external of the convex hull makes the insertion process more
   flexibility. The test result in different amount of the point set shows
   that the time efficiency of the improved algorithm is nearly linearity.}},

Abstract = {{Persistent changes in joint biomechanics resulting from knee injury are
   thought to contribute to progressive cartilage damage and post-traumatic
   osteoarthritis (PTOA). The identification and quantification of in vivo
   tibiofemoral surface interactions are critical to understanding them,
   particularly abnormal interactions that are damaging to articular
   cartilage and other structures of the knee. In this study, we describe
   an approach for understanding such potential interactions by using a
   weighted centroid derived from in vivo stifle kinematics in sheep.
   Collectively, repeatability and sensitivity analyses indicate that the
   magnitude of the changes in tibiofemoral centroid location resulting
   from combined ligament transection is greater than the repeatability and
   precision of the current weighted centroid approach, making this method
   useful for describing the changes in dynamic surface interactions that
   may be relevant in the pathogenesis of PTOA in this stifle injury model.}},

Abstract = {{Many reservoir and production engineers face asphaltene precipitation as
   a major problem during miscible carbon dioxide flooding projects.
   Experimental studies regarding asphaltene precipitation are therefore
   employed to assist in selecting appropriate facilities and proper
   operation schemes. During this study, a series of high pressure, high
   temperature experiments are designed and performed to analyze asphaltene
   precipitation behavior of an Iranian light reservoir crude at reservoir
   conditions due to natural production and miscible CO2 gas injection. For
   both sets of experiments, two different temperature levels (including
   reservoir temperature) are selected to investigate the role of
   temperature on asphaltene precipitation as well. Results of natural
   production experiments indicate that the maximum amount of precipitation
   occurs at reservoir bubble point pressure, while for each specified
   pressure asphaltene precipitation increases as the temperature is raised
   for the whole range of pressures. Carbon dioxide injection experiments,
   however, have terminated in some remarkable findings: for small CO2
   concentrations, CO2 behaves as a hindering agent and lowers the amount
   of precipitation; on the contrary, for higher fractions (values larger
   than critical CO2 concentration), the injection of CO2 results in more
   asphaltene precipitation. An increase in temperature during CO2
   injection results in (1) the increase of asphaltene precipitation, (2)
   the shift of the critical CO2 concentration to lower values, and (3) the
   decrease of the rate of asphaltene precipitation with CO2 concentration.}},

Abstract = {{In big data engineering and digital democracy, modern mathematical means
   and methodologies may be introduced into voting and election data
   analyses in order to gain rigorous perspectives and insights of data
   implications. This paper formally analyzes the nature and mechanisms of
   voting systems and the derivation of collective opinion equilibrium. A
   set of numerical technologies for collective opinions analyses is
   presented in social networks, online voting, and general elections. The
   conventional methods such as those of simple max finding, average
   weighted sum, and statistics are enhanced by rigorous numerical
   regressions and weighted opinion integrations. These novel methodologies
   lead to the finding of a key concept known as collective opinion
   equilibrium implied in any voting and election, which denotes the
   representative centriod elicited from the spectrum of opinion
   distribution. A set of case studies on real-world general electron data
   is rigorously analyzed for demonstrating the value-added applications of
   the formal methods in poll data mining, collective opinion
   determination, and quantitative election data processing.}},

Title = {{An Experimental Study of Flow Behavior of Coiled Tubing Drilling System}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Coiled tubing drilling has become an important development direction of
   drilling. The method of combining theoretical calculation with the
   experimental verification is adopted to analyze the flow of the coiled
   tubing drilling system. A set of experimental bench is developed, three
   kinds of curvature ratio of coiled tubing are used, and the frictional
   pressure losses of coiled tubing and partial pressure drop of each
   downhole tool are tested. The results of experiments with water agree
   well with rough pipe calculation model. The pressure losses of coiled
   tube are obviously larger than that of straight tube, and the value of
   it is about 11-17\%. The larger the curvature ratio is, the more the
   pressure losses of coiled tubing are. The fluid experiment with the
   polymer presents obviously the drag reduction effect. Experiment of
   simulated bottom hole assembly shows that partial pressure drop of
   bottom hole assembly is large. It has a little effect on the pressure
   losses of coiled tubing when whole bottom hole assemblies are connected.
   The research results can be used as the basis for formulating coiled
   tubing drilling process parameters, which will provide a guide for
   engineering practice.}},

Pages = {{1868-1875}},
Abstract = {{Asphaltene precipitation problems manifest themselves in different
   stages of oil reservoirs production. Experimental and modeling
   investigations are, therefore, employed as promising tools to assist in
   predictions of asphaltene precipitation problems and selection of proper
   production facilities. This study concerns experimental and modeling
   investigations of asphaltene precipitation during natural production and
   gas injection operations for a heavy Iranian crude oil at reservoir
   conditions. First, with design and performance of high pressure-high
   temperature experiments, asphaltene precipitation behavior is
   comprehensively investigated; the effects of pressure and temperature
   are fully studied during pressure depletion tests and the role of
   injection gas composition on precipitation is described in gas injection
   experiments. In the next stage, the obtained experimental results are
   fed into a commercial simulator to develop the asphaltene precipitation
   model. The results for the pressure depletion experiments indicate that
   the maximum amount of asphaltene precipitation takes place at fluid
   bubble point pressure. Increase in the temperature, as seen, causes to
   reduce the amount of precipitation for the entire range of pressures.
   For gas injection experiments, the onset of precipitation for CO2,
   associated, and N-2 gases takes place at around 0.20, 0.28, and 0.50 gas
   to mixture mole ratios, respectively. Carbon dioxide shows the highest
   asphaltene precipitation values and nitrogen has the lowest amounts for
   the whole range of gas mole fractions. Finally, the results for modeling
   indicate successful asphaltene precipitation predictions for both
   pressure depletion and gas injection processes.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of reversibility on the viscous fingering of miscible
   reactive flow displacements in homogeneous porous media are examined
   through numerical simulations. A model in which the viscosities mismatch
   between the reactants and the chemical product triggers the instability
   is adopted. The problem is governed by the continuity equation, Darcy's
   law, and the convection-diffusion-reaction equations, which are solved
   using a pseudo-spectral method. It was found that in general, chemical
   reversibility tends to attenuate the instability at the fronts,
   resulting in less complex fingers than in the nonreversible case.
   However, stronger chemical reversibility also leads to less diffuse and
   thinner finger structures. Furthermore, the chemical product was found
   to be homogeneously distributed in the porous medium in the case of the
   reversible reaction, while strong concentration gradients are observed
   in the nonreversible case. The study has also revealed that chemical
   reversibility is capable of enhancing the instability of a stable
   reactive front. It is also found that the rate of production can be the
   same for different cases of frontal instability for a period of time
   that increases with the increase in the magnitude of chemical
   reversibility.}},

Title = {{Activation of H-2 oxidation at sulphur-exposed Ni surfaces under low
   temperature SOFC conditions}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},

Pages = {{9383-9393}},
Abstract = {{Ni-YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) cermets are known to be very good
   anodes in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), which are typically operated
   at 700-1000 degrees C. However, they are expected to be increasingly
   degraded as the operating temperature is lowered in the presence of H2S
   (5-10 ppm) in the H-2 fuel stream. However, at 500 to 600 degrees C, a
   temperature range rarely examined for sulphur poisoning, but of great
   interest for next generation SOFCs, we report that H2S-exposed Ni-YSZ
   anodes are catalytic towards the H-2 oxidation reaction, rather than
   poisoned. By analogy with bulk Ni3S2/YSZ anodes, shown previously to
   enhance H-2 oxidation kinetics, it is proposed that a thin layer of Ni
   sulphide, akin to Ni3S2, is forming, at least at the triple point
   boundary (TPB) region under our conditions. To explain why Ni3S2/YSZ is
   so active, it is shown from density functional theory (DFT) calculations
   that the O-2-anions at the Ni3S2/YSZ TPB are more reactive towards
   hydrogen oxidation than is O-2-at the Ni/YSZ TPB. This is accounted for
   primarily by structural transformations of Ni3S2 during H-2 oxidation,
   rather than by the electronic properties of this interface. To
   understand why a thin layer of Ni3S2 could form when a single monolayer
   of sulphur on the Ni surface is the predicted surface phase under our
   conditions, it is possible that the reaction of H-2 with O2-, forming
   water, prevents sulphur from re-equilibrating to H2S. This may then
   promote Ni sulphide formation, at least in the TPB region.}},

Abstract = {{One of the primary objectives in the design of composite structures is
   the prevention of premature bond failure. Therefore, the
   characterization of cohesive behavior is an important field of study in
   structural engineering. Using fracture mechanics principles, the
   cohesive behavior of an epoxy bonded coarse silica sand aggregate bond
   interface is studied in this paper, with a focus on finding a general
   analytical form of idealizing its behavior when used in a specimen
   possessing asymmetric and inhomogeneous qualities. Two series of
   small-scale specimens were experimentally tested under mixed-mode
   bending (MMB) conditions, where it was found that there was negligible
   influence exerted on the fracture energy of the interface due to changes
   in the mixed-mode ratio or initial crack length. Using finite element
   analysis (FEA) methods, an appropriate bilinear traction-separation
   model was developed to both validate as well as obtain a set of
   consistent parameters applicable to all tested specimens. Comparison of
   the Global Method and the Local Method, used to obtain partitioned Mode
   I and Mode II fracture energy values from MMB specimens, were made, with
   the conclusion that both methods are adequate in the calculation of the
   total fracture energy though the Local Method should be used to obtain
   accurate partitioned Mode I and Mode II fracture energy values.
   Idealization of the bond interface using the cohesive parameters derived
   can be accurately achieved by the use of both contact interactions and
   cohesive elements in two-dimensional and three-dimensional FE models,
   though the results obtained using contact interactions would be expected
   to exhibit greater global stiffness.}},

Title = {{Limitations of using a thermal imager for snow pit temperatures}},
Journal = {{CRYOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{387-394}},
Abstract = {{Driven by temperature gradients, kinetic snow metamorphism plays an
   import role in avalanche formation. When gradients based on temperatures
   measured 10 cm apart appear to be insufficient for kinetic metamorphism,
   faceting close to a crust can be observed. Recent studies that
   visualised small-scale (< 10 cm) thermal structures in a profile of snow
   layers with an infrared (IR) camera produced interesting results. The
   studies found melt-freeze crusts to be warmer or cooler than the
   surrounding snow depending on the large-scale gradient direction.
   However, an important assumption within these studies was that a thermal
   photo of a freshly exposed snow pit was similar enough to the internal
   temperature of the snow. In this study, we tested this assumption by
   recording thermal videos during the exposure of the snow pit wall. In
   the first minute, the results showed increasing gradients with time,
   both at melt-freeze crusts and artificial surface structures such as
   shovel scours. Cutting through a crust with a cutting blade or shovel
   produced small concavities (holes) even when the objective was to cut a
   planar surface. Our findings suggest there is a surface structure
   dependency of the thermal image, which was only observed at times during
   a strong cooling/warming of the exposed pit wall. We were able to
   reproduce the hot-crust/cold-crust phenomenon and relate it entirely to
   surface structure in a temperature-controlled cold laboratory. Concave
   areas cooled or warmed more slowly compared with convex areas (bumps)
   when applying temperature differences between snow and air. This can be
   explained by increased radiative and/or turbulent energy transfer at
   convex areas. Thermal videos suggest that such processes influence the
   snow temperature within seconds. Our findings show the limitations of
   using a thermal camera for measuring pit-wall temperatures, particularly
   during windy conditions, clear skies and large temperature differences
   between air and snow. At crusts or other heterogeneities, we were unable
   to create a sufficiently planar snow pit surface and non-internal
   gradients appeared at the exposed surface. The immediate adjustment of
   snow pit temperature as it reacts with the atmosphere complicates the
   capture of the internal thermal structure of a snowpack with thermal
   videos. Instead, the shown structural dependency of the IR signal may be
   used to detect structural changes of snow caused by kinetic
   metamorphism. The IR signal can also be used to measure near surface
   temperatures in a homogenous new snow layer.}},

Abstract = {{Emerging biomedical applications require realistic phantoms for
   validation and testing of prototype systems. These phantoms require
   stable and flexible tissue-mimicking materials with realistic dielectric
   properties in order to properly model human tissues. To create a
   tissue-mimicking material to fulfill these needs, carbon powder and
   urethane rubber mixtures were created, and the dielectric properties
   were measured using a dielectric probe. Both graphite and carbon black
   were tested. Mixtures of graphite and urethane (0\% to 50\% by weight)
   provided relatively low permittivity and conductivity, suitable for
   mimicking fatty tissues. Mixtures of carbon black and urethane (0\% to
   15\% by weight) provided a broad range of suitable properties. Samples
   with 15\% carbon black had permittivity and conductivity similar to
   higher-water-content tissues, however the cured samples were not
   mechanically suitable for moulding into complex shapes. Finally,
   mixtures of graphite, carbon black, and urethane were created. These
   exhibited a range of dielectric properties and can be used to mimic a
   variety of soft tissues. The mechanical properties of these samples were
   tested and presented properties that exceed typical phantom
   requirements. This tissue-mimicking material will be useful when
   creating thin, flexible, and robust structures such as skin layers.}},

Abstract = {{Particle image velocimetry (PIV) was used to investigate the influence
   of a non-Newtonian blood analog of aqueous xanthan gum on flow
   separation in laminar and transitional environments and in both steady
   and pulsatile flow. Initial steady pressure drop measurements in laminar
   and transitional flow for a Newtonian analog showed an extension of
   laminar behavior to Reynolds number (Re) similar to 2900 for the
   non-Newtonian case. On a macroscale level, this showed good agreement
   with porcine blood. Subsequently, PIV was used to measure flow patterns
   and turbulent statistics downstream of an axisymmetric stenosis in the
   aqueous xanthan gum solution and for a Newtonian analog at Re similar to
   520 and Re similar to 1250. The recirculation length for the
   non-Newtonian case was reduced at Re similar to 520 resultant from
   increased viscosity at low shear strain rates. At Re similar to 1250,
   peak turbulent intensities and turbulent shear stresses were dampened by
   the non-Newtonian fluid in close proximity to the blockage outlet.
   Although the non-Newtonian case's recirculation length was increased at
   peak pulsatile flow, turbulent shear stress was found to be elevated for
   the Newtonian case downstream from the blockage, suggesting shear layer
   fragmentation and radial transport. Our findings conclude that the
   xanthan gum elastic polymer prolongs flow stabilization, which in turn
   emphasizes the importance of non-Newtonian blood characteristics on the
   resulting flow patterns in such cardiovascular environments.}},

Title = {{Chaotic Vibration Analysis of the Bottom Rotating Drill String}},
Journal = {{SHOCK AND VIBRATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Drill string vibration is a widely studied topic. This paper developed a
   real-time measurement system near the drilling bit and extracted the
   lateral vibration, longitudinal vibration time series of bottom rotating
   drill string. In order to reconstruct the phase space, we estimated the
   delay time with mutual information and calculated the embedding
   dimension through Cao's method. Finally, the chaotic characterization of
   the system is analyzed by calculating the correlation dimension and the
   largest Lyapunov exponent. The results show that such system can exhibit
   positive finite-time Lyapunov exponents and a clear convergence toward
   the correlation dimension, which is a strong indicator for the chaotic
   behavior of the system. It is expected that the new dynamics found in
   this paper could be of potential implication to the control methods of
   the drill string vibration.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments on leading-edge vortex (LEV) growth and detachment from a
   plunging profile have been conducted in a free-surface water tunnel.
   Direct-force and velocity-field measurements have been performed at a
   Reynolds number of Re = 10,000, a reduced frequency of k = 0.25, and a
   Strouhal number of St = 0.16, for three varying leading-edge geometries.
   The leading-edge shape is shown to influence the shear layer feeding the
   LEV, and thus to some extent the development of the LEV and associated
   flow topology. This effect in turn influences the arrival time of the
   rear (LEV) stagnation point at the trailing edge, which, once breached,
   constitutes a detachment of the LEV. It is found that despite minor
   phase changes in LEV detachment through leading-edge shape, the position
   of the trailing edge (chord length) should be chosen as the
   characteristic length scale for the vortex separation process.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the physics of flows in a single fracture is the basis for
   modeling subsurface transport problems in fractured media. Capillary
   pressure curve and equivalent aperture have been accepted as tools for
   characterizing capillary invasion and single-phase flow in a single
   fracture. Numerical modeling is used to determine the capillary pressure
   curve and the equivalent aperture for different flow directions in
   sandstone and shale fractures. Invasion percolation method is used to
   model the invasion process of dense non-aqueous phase liquid in a water
   saturated sandstone fracture from different directions. Finite element
   method is applied to model the flows of brine and electric current in
   the fractures along different directions. The numerical results are
   calibrated against the experimental data including capillary pressure
   measurement and single-phase flow tests in the fractures. Results from
   the invasion percolation modeling show that the capillary pressure curve
   is independent of invasion direction. The study on the flows of brine
   and electric current in the fractures illustrates that the sandstone
   fracture displays a higher anisotropy in hydraulic and electrical
   conductivities than the shale fracture. Furthermore, it is found that
   the anisotropy is correlated with the directional roughness, harmonic
   mean, and range of fracture aperture. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   Experiments and numerical modeling}},
Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{419-428}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{ISC (in situ combustion) based enhanced heavy oil recovery is complex
   because there are numerous chemical reactions taking place
   simultaneously. The complexity arises due to the immense number of
   components reacting through many different reaction paths where the
   geology and oil saturation vary spatially within the reservoir. It is
   known that there are four major classes of reactions taking place within
   ISC: LTO (low temperature oxidation), HTO (high temperature oxidation),
   TC (thermal cracking), and aquathermolysis. Within the reservoir, during
   ISC, LTO and TC reactions play a major role by providing fuel for HTO.
   In many reaction schemes in the literature, the LTO interval is
   considered as a single reactive zone spanning a single temperature
   range. In this work, a new reaction scheme is proposed based on analysis
   of previously published thermogravimetric data where the LTO reaction
   temperature range is separated into four temperature subranges each with
   its own dominant reaction products. The new reaction model was
   implemented in a numerical model that revealed that it was able to
   represent the four LTO temperature subranges. In comparison, a numerical
   model using a previously published LTO reaction model with a single
   temperature range was not able to represent the behavior of LTO. (C)

Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{1035-1043}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{In the SAGD (Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage) process, high temperature
   saturated-steam is injected into an oil sands reservoir to lower the
   viscosity of the bitumen hosted within the reservoir. Typical steam
   temperatures range from 200 to 260 degrees C. Under these conditions,
   the bitumen, in presence of steam-condensate, undergoes aquathermolysis
   yielding H2S and CO2. Current SAGD simulation models take into account
   complex spatial heterogeneity of geology and oil composition and the
   physics of heat transfer, multiphase flow, gas solubility effects, and
   viscosity variations with temperature; however, few have taken the
   chemistry of SAGD into account. Here, we have added aquathermolysis
   reactions to a simulation model to understand H2S reactive zones in
   SAGD. Given the requirement to constrain sulfur emissions from thermal
   recovery processes, it is necessary to reduce H2S production to surface.
   The results demonstrate that injecting small amount of SO2, along with
   steam, initiates the Claus reaction in the reservoir which converts H2S
   into liquid sulfur. Thus, sulfur emissions are reduced below that of the
   original operation without SO2 co-injection. The ability to use in situ
   Claus reaction-based H2S scavenging offers an elegant way to reduce
   sulfur emissions from thermal oil sands recovery processes. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Miniaturized bio-diagnostic devices have the potential to allow for
   rapid pathogen screening in clinical patient samples, as a low cost and
   portable alternative to conventional bench-top equipment.
   Miniaturization of key bio-diagnostic techniques, such as: nucleic acid
   detection and quantification, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA
   fingerprinting, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), results in
   substantial reduction of reaction volumes (expensive samples/reagents)
   and shorter reaction times. Droplet microfluidics (DMF) is one of
   several miniaturized bio-sample handling techniques available for
   manipulating clinical samples and reagents in microliter (10(-6) L) to
   picoliter (10(-12) L) volume regime. Electro-actuation of sample and
   reagent in the form of droplets in the aforementioned volume regime,
   using dielectrophoresis (DEP) and/or Electrowetting (EW) are achieved by
   means of patterned, insulated metal electrodes on one or more
   substrates. In this work, we have utilized electro-actuation based DMF
   technology, integrated with suitably tailored resistive micro-heaters
   and temperature sensors, to achieve chip based real-time, quantitative
   PCR (qRT-PCR). This qRT-PCR micro-device was utilized to detect and
   quantify the presence of influenza A and C virus nucleic acids, using
   in-vitro synthesized viral RNA segments. The experimental analysis of
   the DMF micro-device confirms its capabilities in qRT-PCR based
   detection and quantification of pathogen samples, with accuracy levels
   comparable to established commercial bench-top equipment (PCR efficiency
   similar to 95\%). The limit of detection (LOD) of the chip based qRT-PCR
   technique was estimated to be 5 copies of template RNA per PCR reaction.

Abstract = {{An effective property model for infiltrated electrodes is reported that
   predicts the dependence of effective electronic conductivity and active
   TPB length on experimentally controllable and measurable parameters. The
   model uses results from percolation theory and geometric arguments to
   compute the properties of Ni-infiltrated anodes of solid oxide fuel
   cells. While the predicted electronic conductivity is comparable to that
   for a typical composite Ni anode, the predicted effective TPB length is
   approximately two orders of magnitude higher for a Ni infiltrated anode
   with a Ni volume fraction of less than 10\%. The predictions of the
   developed model are compared and validated against three independent
   experimental datasets. Parametric studies using this model suggest that
   decreasing the particle sizes of the infiltrated film and the substrate,
   as well as the substrate porosity will increase the active TPB length.
   While decreasing substrate particle size also increases the effective
   electronic conductivity of the electrode, decreasing substrate porosity
   has the opposite effect. Finally, a methodology is presented to
   quantitatively relate an experimentally observed degradation in
   effective electronic conductivity of infiltrated electrodes to a
   reduction in active TPB length as a function of time. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{This work adopts a water-in-oil (w/o) microemulsion method for the in
   situ preparation of ultradispersed metallic nickel (Ni-0) nanocatalyst
   in heavy oil and assesses its hydrocracking activity. Catalyst
   preparation involved reducing Ni2+ added to the water pools of the heavy
   oil matrix in the form of aqueous Ni(NO3)(2) solution using hydrazine.
   The volume of the aqueous precursors was limited to values which
   corresponded to visually stable single heavy oil phase. The product
   particles were collected by addition of toluene and characterized using
   XRD, TEM, and EDX. These techniques confirmed the formation of nickel
   nanoparticles of 22 +/- 5 nm mean diameter. The hydrocracking activity
   of the as-prepared ultradispersed catalyst was evaluated using a
   semibatch reactor setup under 110 bar of hydrogen and 370 degrees C.
   Although no presulfiding was performed, XRD of the spent catalyst
   confirmed the formation of Ni3S2 nanoparticles with a mean particle size
   of the same range as the Ni-0 particles. Results showed 2-fold
   improvement in the gaseous fractions, around 47\% conversion of the
   residue, more than 70\% reduction in the resins, around 50\% reduction
   in the asphaltenes and an increase in aromatics and saturates in the
   presence of the ultradispersed catalyst.}},

Abstract = {{Functional micro surfaces have been recognized for their vital roles in
   a wide range of advanced applications. The fabrication of surface
   structures at the microlevel can be used to influence tribological,
   optical, and many other surface characteristics. To take advantage of
   the benefits of functional surfaces, industry and researchers have begun
   focusing on finding more sustainable and efficient manufacturing
   processes. The inclined micro ball end milling technique has become a
   fast and efficient method for creating micropatterned surfaces. With the
   right adjustments, the spindle speed and feed rate can be set so that
   the flutes of the cutter create periodic dimpled patterns onto a
   workpiece surface. This micromachining technique is an ideal method for
   fabricating dimpled surfaces, especially for metallic alloys such as
   dies and molds. Developing surface pattern algorithms for generating
   different dimple geometries can promote a sustainable future for a
   variety of novel products and lead to accurate manufacturing of surface
   characteristics. Accurate modeling of cutting forces is important in
   order to generate desired surface patterns without causing tool breakage
   and excessive tool deflection. In this study, a mechanistic force model
   for inclined ball end milling has been proposed and verified for
   generating micro-dimpled surface. The micro-dimple machining technique
   is also applied to microinjection molds to create polymeric components
   with micropatterns. Frictional aspects of both dimpled and inverted
   dimple surfaces have been investigated. The results indicate that
   micro-dimple machining combined with microinjection molding is a viable
   method of producing polymeric components with functional surfaces for
   advanced technological applications.}},

Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1922-1929}},
Abstract = {{Conventional Ni/YSZ solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anodes work well with
   hydrogen but require modification to tolerate hydrocarbon fuels and not
   accumulate carbon, which degrades cell performance and eventually
   damages the anode microstructure. In this work, barium oxide (BaO) was
   incorporated into Ni/YSZ anodes of SOFC by two different methodologies:
   impregnation and microwave irradiation. The performance of the BaO
   incorporated cells was measured in H-2 and CH4 at 1073 K. With the
   impregnation technique, BaO was distributed both on Ni and YSZ grains.
   The BaO was stable on Ni but interacted with YSZ causing a morphological
   change and volume expansion of YSZ, which is problematic in this solid
   device. As such, an alternative method, based on microwave irradiation,
   was developed to selectively deposit BaO only on Ni and minimize the
   interaction between BaO and YSZ. The anode developed by this microwave
   irradiation technique showed comparable electrochemical performance in
   dry CH4 to that of conventional and impregnated anodes, and lower carbon
   accumulation than the conventional anode at 1073 K.}},

Abstract = {{Predicting the spatial distribution and persistence of buried surface
   hoar layers is important when evaluating avalanche hazard. This study
   used weather-based models to predict the formation of surface hoar and
   investigated how buried layers change overtime. Seven years of study
   plot observations from the Columbia Mountains of British Columbia were
   used to calibrate models for surface hoar formation. The latent heat
   flux was modelled with weather station data and forecasted data from the
   Canadian numerical weather prediction model (GEM15). A linear
   relationship was found between vapour mass flux and observed surface
   hoar crystal size (r(2) of 0.84 with weather station data and 0.70 with
   GEM15 data), and was used to predict crystal size over seven winters.
   Crystal size predictions had root mean square errors of 2.4 and 4.1 mm
   with weather station and GEM15 data, respectively. The model was
   compared with other empirical weather-based models. Layers of buried
   surface hoar were tracked with shear frame tests, compression tests (CT)
   and propagation saw tests (PST). PSTs and fracture character in CTs
   indicated that the propensity for propagation in layers of surface hoar
   remained high for up to six weeks. Layers with large crystals were found
   to weakly indicate low stability. Results from this study could be used
   to improve the representation of surface hoar layers in snow cover
   models and make spatial predictions with NWP data. (C) 2013. The

Title = {{Measurements and weather observations at persistent deep slab avalanches}},
Journal = {{COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{97}},
Pages = {{104-112}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Persistent deep slab avalanches are generally hard to forecast and can
   release under diverse conditions ranging from storms to clear days to
   locally induced stress on the snowpack. For the formation of many
   natural avalanches, a point is reached where the mass loading of
   overlying snow exceeds the mechanical properties of the weak layer. This
   can occur from additional loading above the weak layer, such as from
   precipitation or wind loading. Furthermore, natural failure can occur
   from solar warming and temperature variations. External stresses applied
   to the snowpack from skiers, snowmobilers, and other forces can also
   trigger deep slab avalanches. We accessed and made field measurements at
   41 persistent deep slab avalanches that released after the avalanche
   cycle of the respective persistent weak layer. These measurements
   included the properties of the failure layers, slab load, and preceding
   weather to determine trends and correlations between such variables. The
   failure planes were analyzed using the Deep Tap test (DT), Propagation
   Saw Test (PST), shear frame tests, and hand hardness. The overlying
   loads were calculated using density measurements. Spatial variability
   across the crowns was also assessed by the use of multiple profiles and
   tests. Precipitation, temperature, and wind data were obtained from the
   nearest automatic weather station to the respective avalanche start
   zone. DTs often yielded sudden (Q1) fractures and the cut length in PSTs
   was usually less than 60\% of the column length when the fracture
   propagated to the end. Tests were repeated at multiple sites for a few
   deep slab avalanches and they indicated that DT taps and shear strength
   of the failure layer tended to increase with crown height. Crown height
   typically varied substantially at each deep slab avalanche. Preceding
   weather prior to the accessed deep slab avalanches showed an increase in
   precipitation and change in temperature for some releases and little
   change in wind speed and direction for many releases. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{In this work, the effectiveness of cathodic protection (CP) at corrosion

   potential and current distribution at corrosion defects. The CP is
   shielded, at least partially, at the defect, especially at its bottom.
   This effect is enhanced with increasing depth and decreasing width of
   the defect. Empirical equations are derived to enable calculation of CP
   effectiveness at corrosion defects, providing industry recommendations

Title = {{Descriptive Models for Reserve and Regulation Prices in Competitive

Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{In addition to electric energy, ancillary services, such as operating
   reserves and frequency regulation service, are also traded in a
   competitive electricity market. With the emerging smart grid
   technologies and large scale integration of variables resources into the
   grid, the market for ancillary services is expected to grow, and thus,
   their prices become increasingly important. The prices of ancillary
   services feature different patterns and characteristics when compared to
   electric energy prices. The differences include lower price level,
   higher variability, and more frequent and extreme spikes. While electric
   energy prices have been broadly studied in the literature, research on
   features and modelling of ancillary services prices is limited. This
   paper investigates the application of established stochastic approaches
   for modelling the behavior of operating reserve and regulation prices in
   North American electricity markets. Such descriptive stochastic models
   are necessary for risk management and derivative pricing of these
   commodities. Mean-reverting jump-diffusion (MRJD) and Markov
   regime-switching (MRS) models with various specifications are analyzed.
   Historical prices from the Ontario and New York markets have been used
   for model calibration and simulation analysis. The performance of the
   two classes of models has been compared using various statistical
   measures.}},

Abstract = {{Previous work on the stability and convergence analysis of numerical
   methods for the stationary Navier-Stokes equations was carried out under
   the uniqueness condition of the solution, which required that the data
   be small enough in certain norms. In this paper an optimal analysis for
   the finite volume methods is performed for the stationary Navier-Stokes
   equations, which relaxes the solution uniqueness condition and thus the
   data requirement. In particular, optimal order error estimates in the
   -norm for velocity and the -norm for pressure are obtained with large
   data, and a new residual technique for the stationary Navier-Stokes
   equations is introduced for the first time to obtain a convergence rate
   of optimal order in the -norm for the velocity. In addition, after
   proving a number of additional technical lemmas including weighted -norm
   estimates for regularized Green's functions associated with the Stokes
   problem, optimal error estimates in the -norm are derived for the first
   time for the velocity gradient and pressure without a logarithmic factor
   for the stationary Naiver-Stokes equations.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUNDWe sought to assess the hypothesis that length and volumes of
   middle cerebral artery (MCA) thrombus were associated with disappearance
   of the hyperdense middle cerebral artery sign (HMCAS) in acute ischemic
   stroke.
   METHODSThis is a retrospective cohort study of acute ischemic stroke
   patients with MCA occlusion admitted to the University Hospital in
   Canada. The length and volumes of the HMCAS was measured on the plain CT
   by placing CTA images (CTA source images or MIP images) side-by-side.
   RESULTSSeventy-six patients with acute stroke having HMCAS on
   noncontrast CT (NCCT) with M1 MCA occlusion confirmed by CT angiography
   or digital subtraction angiography and received tPA. The treatments
   received were: IV tPA 41(53.9\%) and endovascular treatment IV tPA 35
   (46.1\%). In the IV tPA group, the rate of disappearance varied
   depending on the baseline HMCAS length. Short length HMCAS (<10 mm)
   disappeared in 6/7 (85.7\%) (P < .001). Medium length HMCAS (10-20 mm)
   disappeared in 9/24 (37.5\%). No cases of long length HMCAS (>20 mm)
   disappeared (0/10) (P = .05). Rate of disappearance of HMCAS was found
   to be volume dependent (P < .002).
   CONCLUSIONHMCAS length >10 mm infrequently disappears with IV tPA
   suggesting a potential need for ancillary therapy in this group.}},

Abstract = {{Two dimensional space-time fan filters may be used for the
   highly-selective enhancement of spatio-temporal plane-waves on the basis
   of their directions of arrival. Unlike uniform bandwidth beam filters,
   ideal fan filters transmit passband signals over a range of directions
   of arrival that is independent of their 1D temporal spectrum. In this
   work, closed-form 2D wave-digital filter design equations and
   corresponding hardware architectures are proposed for realizing M
   independent fan-shaped passbands having independently steerable
   directionality and selectivity. A design method based on LCR ladder
   networks is proposed and implemented using a 2D time-multiplexed
   raster-scanned architecture that is suitable for low frequency
   applications such as audio, multimedia, seismic and ultrasonic
   beamforming. The architectures are designed, simulated, physically
   realized and tested on FPGA-based prototypes. Examples of 2D IIR M-fan
   filterbanks with FPGA implementations, together with measured results
   from on-chip hardware verifications, show the successful design and
   hardware realization. The filterbanks and hardware architectures are
   shown to be suitable for real-time sensor-array beamforming applications
   using custom VLSI circuits.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional optimization of culture parameters for the large-scale
   culture of human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) as aggregates is carried
   out in a stepwise manner whereby the effect of varying each culture
   parameter is investigated individually. However, as evidenced by the
   wide range of published protocols and culture performance indicators
   (growth rates, pluripotency marker expression, etc.), there is a lack of
   systematic investigation into the true effect of varying culture
   parameters especially with respect to potential interactions between
   culture variables. Here we describe the design and execution of a
   two-parameter, three-level (3(2)) factorial experiment resulting in nine
   conditions that were run in duplicate 125-mL stirred suspension
   bioreactors. The two parameters investigated here were inoculation
   density and agitation rate, which are easily controlled, but currently,
   poorly characterized. Cell readouts analyzed included fold expansion,
   maximum density, and exponential growth rate. Our results reveal that
   the choice of best case culture parameters was dependent on which cell
   property was chosen as the primary output variable. Subsequent
   statistical analyses via two-way analysis of variance indicated
   significant interaction effects between inoculation density and
   agitation rate specifically in the case of exponential growth rates.
   Results indicate that stepwise optimization has the potential to miss
   out on the true optimal case. In addition, choosing an optimum condition
   for a culture output of interest from the factorial design yielded
   similar results when repeated with the same cell line indicating
   reproducibility. We finally validated that human ESCs remain pluripotent
   in suspension culture as aggregates under our optimal conditions and
   maintain their differentiation capabilities as well as a stable
   karyotype and strong expression levels of specific human ESC markers
   over several passages in suspension bioreactors.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses a methodology for design of broadband power
   amplifiers (PA's). In comparison to conventional class-F and inverse

   of fundamental, second and third harmonic impedances. This manuscript
   presents an approach based on in-band mode transfer between continuous
   inverse class-F and continuous class-F to allow for the realization of
   high efficiency PAs with up-to one octave bandwidth. The validation of
   this mode transfer concept is performed using a 10-W Gallium Nitride
   (GaN) device. The PA, which was designed in Advanced Design Systems,
   exhibited a drain efficiency of greater than 60\%, a power gain higher
   than 13 dB, and an output power of more than 10W over the frequency band
   ranging from 460 to 920 MHz, which corresponds to one octave bandwidth

Abstract = {{A new calibration technique for a concurrent dual band six port receiver
   (SPR) is presented. This calibration technique uses a modified memory
   polynomial (MP) to model the non-idealities and imperfections in the six
   port receiver architecture which includes the six port wave correlator
   and the diode detectors used. Using an inverse model, the in-phase and
   quadrature component of a transmitted signal is estimated. This is a
   black box model and the calibration coefficients are estimated by
   sending and receiving a known training signal. The least square
   algorithm is used in coefficient estimation. The calibration technique
   is used to receive concurrently two signals with different modulation
   and characteristics. First 64-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and
   16-QAM signals are received concurrently. In a second measurement test,
   WCDMA and LTE signals were concurrently received to validate the
   suitability of the proposed technique for realistic communication
   signals. The performance of the presented calibration technique was
   compared with the simple linear combination (LC) calibration technique.
   The MP calibration technique had EVMs of 1.6\% and 1.3\% while the EVMs
   using the LC calibration technique are 15.4\% and 14.1\% for the 64 QAM
   and 16 QAM signal pair respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the increasing demands for large capacity and high performance
   wireless transmitters, multi-band transmitter architectures play an
   important role in modern communications. Thus, advances in the design
   techniques of radio frequency (RF) power amplifiers (PAs) have promoted
   the use of a single multi-band PA and RF components in order to
   concurrently process multiple input signals located in different
   frequency bands. In this paper, digital signal processing (DSP)
   techniques for linearity and efficiency enhancement of multi-band
   envelope tracking (ET) transmitters are discussed. A two-dimensional
   digital predistortion (2D-DPD) is used for linearization of the
   dual-band PA around each band separately, relaxing the high speed
   requirements needed by wideband DPD. Power efficiency enhancement of the
   dual band PA is accomplished by adopting bandwidth reduced envelope
   shaping functions that depend on the original envelopes of the two
   concurrent signals driving the PA, which provides a good compromise
   between efficiency and linearity. The proposed architecture is
   experimentally validated where linearization and efficiency enhancement
   results are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Big data are extremely large-scaled data in terms of quantity,
   complexity, semantics, distribution, and processing costs in computer
   science, cognitive informatics, web-based computing, cloud computing,
   and computational intelligence. Censuses and elections are a typical
   paradigm of big data engineering in modern digital democracy and social
   networks. This paper analyzes the mechanisms of voting systems and
   collective opinions using big data analysis technologies. A set of
   numerical and fuzzy models for collective opinion analyses is presented
   for applications in social networks, online voting, and general
   elections. A fundamental insight on the collective opinion equilibrium
   is revealed among electoral distributions and in voting systems. Fuzzy
   analysis methods for collective opinions are rigorously developed and
   applied in poll data mining, collective opinion determination, and
   quantitative electoral data processing.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a unique and practical study toward automating
   analysis and design of software. In this work, we have automated
   generation of package diagrams in software design process. We have
   employed a clustering algorithm, and have defined a similarity measure
   for packaging classes of the software. The similarity measure is defined
   in a way to increase the cohesion and decrease the coupling between the
   packages. The process of moving from requirement to design is
   traditionally done through an ad-hoc process. Although the criterion for
   a good design is well-defined in software engineering for different
   system architectures, the design of the system is only as good as the
   design choices of the engineers. Therefore having a systematic solution
   which recommends design choices based on system requirements is highly
   desirable and it leads to increasing the quality of software as well as
   saving in cost and time. The Applicability of our solution is
   demonstrated using a case study of an elevator control system.}},
