Abstract = {{Swing leg retraction, the backward rotation of the swing leg prior to
   heel-strike, is known to have several advantages in legged locomotion.
   To achieve this motion, a hip torque is required at the end of the swing
   phase to brake the forward rotation of the leg and/or accelerate its
   backward motion. In walking, pre-emptive push-off of the stance leg also
   occurs at the end of the swing, so its relative timing with late-swing
   retracting torque influences gait energetics. To find the best relative
   timing between the stance leg's push-off force and the swing leg
   retraction torque, we calculate their work-based energetics in a simple
   bipedal model using impulsive approximations and with the aid of the
   so-called overlap parameter that quantifies the relative order and the
   percentage overlap of the push-off and retraction impulses. By
   minimizing the energetic cost of the gait, we found that it is
   energetically favorable to start with the push-off force, and postpone
   braking the leg swing until completely after the push-off (impulsive
   force/torque). The implication for the more realistic non-impulsive
   cases is to apply the retraction torque at the very end of the push-off
   before heel-strike. We show that the results are valid for many other
   bipedal models, for both periodic and aperiodic gaits, and regardless of
   the actuator efficiencies for positive and negative work.}},

Abstract = {{An integral part of test case is the verification phase (also called
   `test oracle'), which verifies program's state, output or behavior. In
   automated testing, the verification phase is often implemented using
   test assertions which are usually developed manually by testers. More
   precisely, assertions are used for checking the unit or the system's
   behavior (or output) which is reflected by the changes in the data
   fields of the class under test, or the output of the function under
   test. Originated from human (testers') error, test suites are prone to
   having inadequate assertions. The paper reports an empirical study on
   the Inadequate-Assertion (IA) problem in the context of automated test
   suites developed for open-source projects. In this study, test suites of
   three active open-source projects have been chosen. To investigate IA
   problem occurrence among the sampled test suites, we performed mutation
   analysis and coverage analysis. The results indicate that: (1) the IA
   problem is common among the sampled open-source projects, and the
   occurrence varies from project to project and from package to package,
   and (2) the occurrence rate of the IA problem is positively co-related
   with the complexity of test code.}},

Abstract = {{The progress in the micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) sensors
   technology in size, cost, weight, and power consumption allows for new
   research opportunities in the navigation field. Today, most of
   smartphones, tablets, and other handheld devices are fully packed with
   the required sensors for any navigation system such as GPS, gyroscope,
   accelerometer, magnetometer, and pressure sensors. For seamless
   navigation, the sensors' signal quality and the sensors availability are
   major challenges. Heading estimation is a fundamental challenge in the
   GPS-denied environments; therefore, targeting accurate attitude
   estimation is considered significant contribution to the overall
   navigation error. For that end, this research targets an improved
   pedestrian navigation by developing sensors fusion technique to exploit
   the gyroscope, magnetometer, and accelerometer data for device attitude
   estimation in the different environments based on quaternion
   mechanization. Results indicate that the improvement in the traveled
   distance and the heading estimations is capable of reducing the overall
   position error to be less than 15 m in the harsh environments.}},

Abstract = {{Series capacitive switches controlled by means of pneumatic pressure are
   introduced. The switch was incorporated into a microstrip line to
   demonstrate its viability. The position of a copper-coated dielectric
   solid slug, confined in a chamber which rests on top of a gap in the

   switch was fabricated and measured using a TRL calibration to remove the
   effect of the coax-to-microstrip transitions. The simulated insertion
   loss of the closed switch was below 0.5 dB up to 15 GHz and up to 10 GHz
   for the fabricated device. The measured isolation of the open switch is
   better than 15 dB over the entire measured range up to 15 GHz.
   Successful fabrication and measurement of these switches serves as a

Abstract = {{Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is
   characterized by progressive dementia, choreiform involuntary movements,
   and emotional deterioration. Neuropathological features include the
   progressive degeneration of striatal gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
   neurons. New therapeutic approaches, such as the transplantation of
   human neural precursor cells (hNPCs) to replace damaged or degenerated
   cells, are currently being investigated. The aim of this study was to
   investigate the potential for utilizing telencephalic hNPCs expanded in
   suspension bioreactors for cell restorative therapy in a rodent model of
   HD. hNPCs were expanded in a hydrodynamically controlled and homogeneous
   environment under serum-free conditions. In vitro analysis revealed that
   the bioreactor-expanded telencephalic (BET)-hNPCs could be
   differentiated into a highly enriched population of GABAergic neurons.
   Behavioral assessments of unilateral striatal quinolinic acid-lesioned
   rodents revealed a significant improvement in motor and memory deficits
   following transplantation with GABAergic cells differentiated from
   BET-hNPCs. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that transplanted
   BET-hNPCs retained a GABAergic neuronal phenotype without aberrant
   transdifferentiation or tumor formation, indicating that BET-hNPCs are a
   safe source of cells for transplantation. This preclinical study has
   important implications as the transplantation of GABAergic cells derived
   from predifferentiated BET-hNPCs may be a safe and feasible cell
   replacement strategy to promote behavioral recovery in HD.}},

Title = {{Numerical Solution of a Moving Boundary Problem of One-Dimensional Flow
   in Semi-Infinite Long Porous Media with Threshold Pressure Gradient}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{A numerical method is presented for the solution of a moving boundary
   problem of one-dimensional flow in semi-infinite long porous media with
   threshold pressure gradient (TPG) for the case of a constant flow rate
   at the inner boundary. In order to overcome the difficulty in the space
   discretization of the transient flow region with a moving boundary in
   the process of numerical solution, the system of partial differential
   equations for the moving boundary problem is first transformed
   equivalently into a closed system of partial differential equations with
   fixed boundary conditions by a spatial coordinate transformation method.
   Then a stable, fully implicit finite difference method is adopted to
   obtain its numerical solution. Finally, numerical results of transient
   distance of the moving boundary, transient production pressure of
   wellbore, and formation pressure distribution are compared graphically
   with those from a published exact analytical solution under different
   values of dimensionless TPG as calculated from actual experimental data.
   Comparison analysis shows that numerical solutions are in good agreement
   with the exact analytical solutions, and there is a big difference of
   model solutions between Darcy's flow and the fluid flow in porous media
   with TPG, especially for the case of a large dimensionless TPG.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a Doherty power amplifier (PA) with significantly
   improved efficiency over large output power range. The efficiency
   enhancement is accomplished by associating digital adaptive power
   distribution and dynamic phase alignment mechanisms, which are
   implemented to prevent the efficiency degradation due to the problems of
   input drive waste at back-off, power-dependent phase misalignment
   between carrier and peaking branches, and impaired load modulation
   behavior. The measured average efficiency of the proposed Doherty PA is
   53\% compared to 45\% for a standard Doherty PA.}},

   engineers to create new and innovative technologies at the same time as

   of a creative, project-based learning program called Exploring

Abstract = {{Microwave interrogation of biological tissues involves measuring very
   weak signals from a highly reflective object. This requires special ways
   to collect the signals and methodology to improve sensitivity. In the
   literature, numerous designs for ultra-wideband antennas intended for
   biological sensing applications have been reported {[}1-4]. When
   deploying sensors in prototype systems, an additional level of
   complexity arises when the system needs to adapt to the human body,
   which varies in size and shape from patient-to-patient {[}5]. At the
   University of Calgary we have developed two different systems targeted
   to breast imaging using ultra-wideband (UWB) signals {[}6,7]. Based on
   our experience in developing these systems and our initial testing with
   breast cancer patients and volunteers, we identified the need for
   different approaches to data collection.
   We have developed a mono-static radar system {[}6], and used this system
   in a study of 9 patients. This experience has led to the development of
   a second-generation system (Fig. 1) that permits positioning of the
   sensors with four degrees of freedom. The additional two degrees of
   freedom (compared to the first prototype) provide the capability to
   adapt to different breast sizes and shapes while orienting the sensor
   normal to the breast skin as shown in Fig. 2. The outline of the breast
   is measured using a laser system before positioning the sensor at the
   desired location and orientation.
   We also developed a system to measure transmitted signals over a large
   band of frequencies in order to estimate average electrical properties
   of the breast {[}7]. The results of the transmission measurement study
   indicated the value of collecting measurements with multiple sensors
   (i.e. more than one transmit and one receive element). This has led to
   the development of a new sensor, dubbed the Nahanni {[}8], shown in Fig.
   3, which is implemented into our new transmission measurement system,
   shown in Fig. 4. This system is composed of two arrays each containing 5
   sensors. The breast is placed between the two array assemblies while the
   upper element can be lowered to come into contact with the breast skin.
   While being similar to a mammography system, only slight deformation of
   the breast tissues will be necessary for the examination. Thanks to our
   new sensor, no immersion medium is required. This permits to realize a
   system that is drastically easier to deploy.
   {[}GRAPHICS]
   In this contribution, we will discuss our experiences with the patient
   studies that we have conducted, focusing on challenges that are
   encountered in measuring meaningful signals. The latest systems designed
   to address these challenges and their applications will also be
   discussed.}},

   The DR scheme coordinates the inter-cell interference (ICI) stemming
   from adjacent cells and increases the desired signal level at cell-edge
   regions. To validate the performance of the DR scheme, we derive the
   average signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) and the average
   capacity and compare it with the conventional universal frequency reuse
   factor (UFRF). The results show that the proposed DR scheme provides
   higher average SINR and average capacity compared to the UFRF due to the
   assistance of the distributed relay nodes.}},

Abstract = {{When GNSS is used as a stand-alone navigation system in safety-critical
   or liability-critical applications, GNSS measurement reliability must be
   properly addressed. One of the main issues is the detection and the
   exclusion of faults in complex GNSS environments where there are high
   levels of code multipath that can generate biased measurements. The
   performance of the position calculation in terms of accuracy, robustness
   and reliability can be improved by applying SBAS corrections and by
   employing multiple GNSS constellations.
   This paper investigates the case of combined GPS and GLONASS
   constellations, and EGNOS corrections available for the GPS measurements
   only. A covariance simulation method is applied, and challenging road
   environments are specifically considered. Moreover, the paper also
   analyses the effect on the position solution when using a broadcast
   time-offset between two constellations. GPS, GLONASS and EGNOS are
   considered as they are presently operational systems, however the
   results can be generalized and applied to other future and emerging
   GNSS.}},

Abstract = {{Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) can provide accurate
   PVT(position, velocity, time) information all over the world, and has
   been an important resource of supporting a wide range of civil

   Navigation Satellite System has certain capability of immunity from
   interference since Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) is utilized in
   GNSS, while with the electromagnetic environment becoming increasingly
   complex the suppression technique is needed to ensure the performance of
   GNSS receiver increasingly urgent.
   This paper describes transform domain interference suppression in GNSS
   receiver based on FrFT in allusion to the suppression of common
   interference signals. Through pattern recognition with jamming types,
   this method can suppress the interference at corresponding fractional
   order where the energy spectrum have best focused effect, for the
   narrow-band and multi-tone interference use FFT while for the pectinate
   and chirp interference FrFT is adapted. The result validates that this
   method can suppress multiple interferences simultaneously and has a well
   adaptive capability. In addition, it can make a flexible trade-off

Abstract = {{The foot mounted inertial measurement unit (IMU) has been used for
   inertial-based pedestrian navigation in recent literatures, where zero
   velocity updates (ZUPT) are applied each time the user takes a step. As
   only the velocity error is directly observed through ZUPT, the position
   error still accumulates with time, which limits the wide use of this
   method. According to previous research, the position error exceeds 10 m
   within about 10 minutes.
   In this research, a floor plan-based vision aiding method is proposed,
   from which the position update can be derived, to correct the position
   errors in the inertial-based pedestrian navigation. The proposed
   algorithm is designed to integrate two-dimensional camera image with the
   geodetic position and real scale of floor plan to derive
   three-dimensional camera position and orientation, hence to limit the
   accumulative error in inertial-based pedestrian navigation. The indoor
   field test results indicate that the pedestrian position solution is
   significantly improved with the vision aiding and the maximum error is
   reduced from over 15m to less than 4m in about 14 minutes.}},

Abstract = {{With the development of GNSS, more and more satellites could be used in
   the sky. Therefore, the multi-constellation receiver becomes popular. As
   a key part to ensure the reliability of receiver, Receiver Autonomous
   Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) has been a hot research topic. The
   Least-square residual method is a common Faults Detection and Exclusion
   (FDE) method which is based on the sum of the squares of the range
   residual errors (SSE). However, due to the mutual influence of
   observations (i.e., an error of one observation is absorbed by the
   residuals of all observations) erroneous rejection of a good observation
   is possible, especially with large or multiple biases, called FDE
   failure. To take advantages of the large number of satellites by
   multi-constellation, this paper proposed an enhanced RAIM algorithm
   based on the weighted and subset schemes to overcome FDE failure. Even
   under the large or multiple biases, a reliable navigation solution can
   be concluded.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a cooperative vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) relative
   positioning approach using a federated filtering scheme in a Vehicular
   ad hoc Network (VANET) based on the techniques of differential GPS
   (DGPS) baseline estimation and Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) ranging. The
   relative positioning problem is addressed by assuming each vehicle in
   the VANET is equipped with a GPS receiver, UWB ranging radio, and
   communication devices through which information can be exchanged among
   elements in the network. The solution to this problem is a federated
   filtering structure where each vehicle runs a decentralized local filter
   estimating the relative positions between it and the neighboring
   vehicles using all local observations and a global fusion filter that
   fuses each vehicle's local filter estimate with the other vehicles'
   local filter estimates updated using only independent observations to
   this vehicle. The proposed approach relies on V2V communication that
   broadcasts each vehicle's local GPS observations for differential
   processing and each vehicle's local estimate to the other neighboring
   vehicles for further global fusion. A GPS and UWB data collection
   campaign involving three vehicles traveling around a ``T{''} shape
   intersection was conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed
   approach. GPS pseudorange and Doppler and UWB range observations were
   used for V2V baseline estimation with 20-30 cm of accuracy achieved. The
   benefit of the proposed approach is assessed by comparing it with
   traditional moving-base station DGPS involving only two vehicles.}},

   Truss Girders}},

Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2332}},
Pages = {{64-73}},
Abstract = {{An innovative, corrosion-free, precast, prestressed concrete truss
   girder has been developed for short- and medium-span, slab-on-girder
   bridges. The girder consists of top and bottom concrete flanges
   connected by precast vertical and diagonal members and made of
   fiberreinforced polymer (FRP) tubes filled with concrete. The verticals
   and diagonals are connected, respectively, to the concrete flanges by
   means of glass FRP dowels and stud reinforcement made of
   corrosion-resistant steel or FRP material. The flanges are pretensioned
   with carbon FRP tendons. The deck slab is reinforced with
   corrosion-resistant steel bars in the bottom transverse layer and with
   glass FRP bars in the bottom longitudinal and the top layers. The
   girders may be posttensioned with external carbon FRP tendons to balance
   the slab weight and to provide continuity in multispan bridges. The new
   system has the advantages of light weight and enhanced durability. The
   light weight reduces the initial cost and allows for longer spans. The
   improved durability reduces the maintenance cost and extends the
   structure's life span. This paper describes the general details of the
   system and presents an experimental evaluation of its critical
   components, namely, the FRP tubes and the truss connections. Two types
   of FRP tubes and four types of connections were investigated. The
   results are presented of tests of eight connection specimens under
   static loading and four specimens under fatigue. The tests showed
   excellent performance of the connections when filament-wound tubes and
   continuous double-headed studs were used.}},

Abstract = {{Characteristics of a small scale wind turbine using Permanent Magnet
   Synchronous Generator and connected to a grid through a reduced switches
   count converter (two legs only) are studied in this paper. Active power
   output corresponding with the input is given with the reactive power
   produced by the wind turbine regulated at 0 MVAr. Variable wind speed is
   optimum for drive train performance at 10 m/s (at maximum power
   coefficient point). When wind speed changes, the turbine moves away from
   its optimal tip speed ratio until maximum power point tracking forces
   the turbine to operate at its optimal speed. The generator torque is
   regulated by controlling the generator current based on the principle of
   field oriented control where a decoupling between the field and torque
   current components is achieved. The generator reference voltage and the
   converter switching signals are synthesized using the principle of space
   vector modulation. A 5.7 kW grid-connected variable speed wind turbine
   is simulated using Matlab/Simulink to study the feasibility of the
   proposed control technique.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common type of blood
   cancer in Canadian adults. CLL cells are abnormal lymphocytes, which
   tend to be slightly larger than normal resting lymphocytes and have a
   condensed appearance to their chromatin. There is a low number of
   related works on this disease. This paper presents a method to segment
   normal and CLL lymphocytes into two parts: nucleus, and cytoplasm using
   a watershed algorithm and optimal thresholding. The goal of this work is
   reducing the over and under segmentation error of the watershed
   algorithm by suppressing 1\% of the local minima. We tested 140
   microscopic lymphocyte images (normal and CLL), and the algorithm
   obtained 99.92\% maximum accuracy for nucleus segmentation, and 99.85\%
   maximum accuracy for cell segmentation. The cytoplasm can be extracted
   with a 99.63\% maximum accuracy with simple mask subtraction. The code
   for the presented algorithm is shared on the MATLAB (R) file exchange
   website.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial demands for agent-based software engineering have
   significantly increased in the past years. To detect and address the
   unexpected failures in early design stage of multi-agent systems,
   several methodologies have been proposed. Agent UML (AUML) is a
   methodology for agent-based software development that is an extension of
   the widely accepted UML. AUML handles the interactions among agents by
   extending UML in dealing with agent-based challenges. In this paper,
   Agent UML is employed for designing multi-agent systems. A set of
   conversion rules is proposed to convert Agent UML methodology into UML
   sequence diagrams that can be used for behavior model synthesis. Then,
   an automated tool is developed for multi-agent system verification that
   can replace the existing ad-hoc methods. To validate the proposed
   methods, a case study of a Real-Time Fleet Management System is used.}},

Abstract = {{Multi agent systems (MAS) play an important role in many of industrial
   software systems today. MAS are distributed systems and there is no
   central control for the agents in most of the systems. The lack of
   central control and the local view of each agent from the whole system
   may cause some unexpected behaviors which is called emergent behavior.
   Detecting and fixing these unexpected behaviors is more valuable and
   cost effective in the requirement and design phases rather than the
   implementation. In this paper, a method for the detection of emergent
   behaviors in MAS focusing on analysis phase of MaSE methodology and
   fixing them in the design phase is presented. The contributions of this
   work are investigating a specific type of emergent behaviors, the
   detection of them in MaSE methodology, and proposing solutions for the
   detected emergent behaviors. The details and the architecture of the
   system are presented. The method and how to apply this on MaSE is shown
   along with a case study followed by the discussion part.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the energy efficiency (EE) of a 2-tier cellular network
   subject to downlink transmission outage probability constraints is
   analyzed under a shared spectrum scenario. The heterogeneous network
   considered consists of randomly distributed microcell BSs overlaid with
   picocell BSs. Based on the analysis of the structure of the EE function,
   the sufficient condition that enables the EE of the 2-tier network to
   exceed that of a single tier network is determined. The operational
   bounds for the network in terms of the pico tier BS density is derived
   by analytically solving the optimization problem that maximizes the
   outage constrained 2-tier EE. The Lagrange multipliers attributed to the
   outage constraints, which quantify the marginal loss in the EE
   performance, are found to be strongly dependent on the power consumption
   parameters of both the micro and pico tier BSs. The implication of the
   findings is that, by carefully tuning the BS power consumption
   parameters, it is possible to realize significant improvement in the EE
   performance for different operational scenarios while satisfying the
   outage probability objectives.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of preamble detection in Physical Random Access Channel
   (PRACH) for long term evolution (LTE) and its advanced degrades when
   channels become more time dispersive, such as Extended Typical Urban
   (ETU). However, the Base Station (BS) target received power is
   determined by users with time dispersive channels, in order to keep the
   acceptable performance for most of users in a cell. Motivated by the
   idea of collecting the energy of multiple paths, the optimal statistic
   is derived in this paper given the Power Delay Profile (PDP) of Rayleigh
   fading channels. An analytical framework of performance is also proposed
   in this paper and verified by simulation. It is shown that the proposed
   optimal statistic increasingly outperforms the traditional peak
   detecting when time-dispersion of channels increases. Considering the
   difficulty of achieving the accurate PDP in some scenarios, a suboptimal
   but robust solution is further developed. Compared with peak detecting,
   the suboptimal solution lowers the BS's target received power by over
   1.1dB for Format 0 PRACH with both 2 and 4 receive antennas in the ETU
   channel, significantly reduces the user's power consumption and improves
   the LTE PRACH coverage.}},

Journal = {{WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Coupling of adsorption with electrochemical oxidation is a novel
   approach to the treatment of aqueous organics that has demonstrated a
   number of key benefits over the individual application of these
   processes. This is based on a highly conducting adsorbent material,
   developed under the trade name Nyex(TM), that is able to rapidly adsorb
   the organics and anodically oxidise them within a single treatment unit.
   Successful scale up of the process (in both continuous and batch
   operation) has been achieved for the polishing of two separate
   groundwaters (one containing relatively simple petrol, diesel and their
   degradation products and the other with a range of more complex
   organics). Treatment showed that low discharge consents can be achieved,
   including the removal of more complex and difficult to treat compounds
   to below the limits of detection. Energy consumption for electrochemical
   regeneration was relatively low (down to 0.5 kWh/m(3)) suggesting that
   the process could be a practical alternative approach for effluent
   polishing.}},

Abstract = {{Capturing CO2 emissions from energy production and storing it under the
   ground is a potential CO2 mitigation strategy that currently receives
   much attention. Both CO2 capture and CO2 storage are solubility
   problems. This paper reviews some important solubility aspects of CO2
   capture and storage that are often overlooked. Until very recently,
   there was not a single CO2 solubility relationship that was both
   applicable in a wide temperature range and thermodynamically consistent
   with the enthalpy of solution of CO2. Furthermore, very often the
   relationship used for the first acidity constant of carbonic acid as a
   function of temperature is inconsistent with the relationship used for
   the solubility constant (or Henry constant) of CO2. The removal of CO2
   from a gas stream with amine solutions is usually viewed as a chemical
   reaction, which leads to the practice of heating to remove the CO2 from
   the solvent. However, viewing this process as a solubility phenomenon
   suggests the practice of using vacuum to remove the CO2 from the
   solvent, a potentially more efficient approach.}},

Abstract = {{Tracking objects in dynamic scene is an interesting area of research and
   it has it's applications in many areas like surveillance, missile
   tracking system, virtual reality and robot vision. Objects in real world
   exhibit complex interactions with each other. When captured in a video
   signal, these interactions manifest themselves as intertwineing motions,
   occlusion and pose changes. A video tracking system should track these
   objects in this complex interactions smoothly. This paper presents a new
   joint method for tracking moving objects in outdoor and indoor
   environment. This joint method uses recursive Expectation-Maximization
   (EM) incorporated with Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate, fuse
   and track the object simultaneously, than doing it in two different
   steps. This combined approach provides more realistic solution to the
   problem. Thereby, out performing the conventional method of treating it
   as three different problems. We have tested our algorithm with standard
   dataset and real time video sequences collected from indoor environment.
   We also find that the usage of the joint method improves the accuracy
   and computational cost. This method successfully tracks object with
   occlusions, different orientations and intertwining motion.}},

Abstract = {{semi-analytical method for modeling the effects of electromagnetic

   2-D transfer function enables prediction of the distortions in array
   factor due to coupling and thereby enables the potential design of
   coupling-compensation algorithms. The method is verified with
   simulations in the 1.5-2.0-GHz range on both an N = 7-element ULA using
   CST Microwave Studio using 50-Omega terminations and a N = 3-element ULA
   in FEKO but with non-50 W impedance obtained from measurements of a CMOS
   low noise amplifier (LNA). Coupling effect on array factor of
   delay-sum-type beamformer was examined. The proposed model atches within

Abstract = {{A comparison between the multiple-valued differential-time-signaling
   (MVDTS) link and other serial links is presented in this paper. An
   example of a 4-bit 1.6Gbps serial link has been designed and simulated
   using SerDes and differential-time-signaling (DTS) architectures. A
   commercial FPGA kit has been used to implement the simulated serial
   links and the results have been compared to the simulated results. In
   addition, a 6-bit 15Gbps serial link has been designed using SerDes, DTS
   and MVDTS links. A comparison among the three links, based on the
   simulated results in terms of design details and spectral content, is
   provided. The MVDTS shows advantages over the two other serial links, in
   that it concentrates the transmitted signal energy in lower bandwidth
   compared to the DTS and SerDes links, uses much lower input clock
   frequency compared to the SerDes link for the same link rate, and has
   better jitter characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a real-time AC/DC signal data acquisition (DAQ) technique
   was developed, which is capable of separating the DC and AC potential
   components from the recorded total potential, providing mechanistic
   information about the steel corrosion in the presence of AC
   interference. It was found that the corrosion of the steel is enhanced
   by the applied AC current density from 0 to 400 A/m(2). With the further
   increase to 600 A/m(2) and 800 A/m(2), the corrosion rate of the steel
   decreases, which is attributed to passivation of the steel at
   sufficiently high AC current densities, and a compact film is formed on
   the steel surface. Moreover, the derived mathematic relationships
   between AC potential and AC current density provides a potential
   alternative to determine AC current density on pipelines based on
   measurements of AC potential in the field.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a finite element (FE) model was developed to simulate the
   complex stress/strain conditions potentially exerted on the northern
   pipelines due to the synergism of internal pressure, soil strain and
   local stress/strain concentration at corrosion defects. The effects of
   pre-strain on corrosion of the steel and the pipeline failure pressure
   were investigated. Results demonstrated that a high intensity
   stress/strain field generates preferentially at the bottom of corrosion
   defect. The increase of operating pressure would increase the stress
   concentration at defect and the plastically deformed area. Both tensile
   and compressive soil strains increase the stress intensity and plastic
   deformation. Thus, a pipe containing corrosion defects or mechanical
   dents is susceptible to hoop cracking or local bulking under the tensile
   and compressive soil strains, respectively. Moreover, while an elastic
   strain enhances slightly the steel corrosion, the effect of plastic
   strain is much remarkable. In optimal pipeline design, the reliable risk
   assessment of high-strength steel pipelines should consider the
   corrosion enhancement and defect propagation under the complex
   stress/strain conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Time-of-flight-based three-dimensional cameras are the state-of-the-art
   imaging modality for acquiring rapid 3D position information. Unlike any
   other technology on the market, it can deliver 2D images co-located with
   distance information at every pixel location, without any shadows.
   Recent technological advancements have begun miniaturizing such
   technology to be more suitable for laptops and eventually cellphones.
   This paper explores the systematic errors inherent to the new PMD
   CamBoard nano camera. As the world's most compact 3D time-of-flight
   camera it has applications in a wide domain, such as gesture control and
   facial recognition. To model the systematic errors, a one-step
   point-based and plane-based bundle adjustment method is used. It
   simultaneously estimates all systematic errors and unknown parameters by
   minimizing the residuals of image measurements, distance measurements,
   and amplitude measurements in a least-squares sense. The presented
   self-calibration method only requires a standard checkerboard target on
   a flat plane, making it a suitable candidate for on-site calibration. In
   addition, because distances are only constrained to lie on a plane, the
   raw pixel-by-pixel distance observations can be used. This makes it
   possible to increase the number of distance observations in the
   adjustment with ease. The results from this paper indicate that
   amplitude-dependent range errors are the dominant error source for the
   nano under low scattering imaging configurations. Post user
   self-calibration, the RMSE of the range observations reduced by almost
   50\%, delivering range measurements at a precision of approximately
   2.5cm within a 70cm interval.}},

Abstract = {{Embryonic stem (ES) cells are a uniquely self-renewing, pluripotent
   population of cells that must be differentiated before being useful for
   cell therapy. Since most studies utilize subcutaneous implantation to
   test the in vivo functionality of ES cell-derived cells, the objective
   of the current study was to develop an appropriate and clinically
   relevant in vivo implantation system in which the behavior and
   tumorigenicity of ES cell-derived cells could be effectively tested in a
   tissue-specific (orthotopic) site. Male ES cells were differentiated
   either into osteoblasts or chondrocytes using protocols that were
   previously developed and published by our laboratory. The differentiated
   cells were implanted into a burr-hole fracture created in the proximal
   tibiae of immunocompetent female mice, strain matched to the ES cell
   line. The ability of the differentiated ES cell-derived cells (bearing
   the Y chromosome) to incorporate into the newly formed bone was assessed
   by micro-computed tomography imaging and histochemistry. ES cells
   differentiated with either osteogenic or chondrogenic medium
   supplementation formed a soft tissue mass that disrupted the normal bone
   architecture by 4 weeks after implantation in some mice. In contrast,
   mice receiving osteoblastic cells that were differentiated in a
   three-dimensional type 1 collagen gel showed evidence of new bone
   formation at the defect site without evidence of tumor formation for up
   to 8 weeks after implantation. In this injury model, type 1 collagen is
   more effective than medium supplementation at driving more complete
   differentiation of ES cells, as evidenced by reducing their
   tumorigenicity. Overall, the current study emphasizes the importance of
   using an appropriate orthotopic implantation system to effectively test
   the behavior and tumorigenicity of the cells in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Although information pertaining to the viscous characterization of HES
   130/0.4 Voluven (R) and HES 260/0.45 Pentaspan (R) is available,
   quantification is limited to 100\% concentrations. We focus here on the
   quantification of their viscous behavior along with HES 130/0.4 Volulyte
   (R) in a shear thinning non-Newtonian blood analog of aqueous xanthan
   gum and glycerol. Dynamic viscosities of multiple batches of HES fluids
   were measured through capillary viscometry. The viscous behavior of
   100\%, 25\% and 12.5\% concentrations were then measured through a
   closed flow loop across physiologically relevant flow rates. Measured
   viscosities were 2.57 millipascal second (mPa.s) 6.52 mPa.s and 2.48
   mPa.s for HES 130/0.4 Voluven (R), HES 260/0.45 and HES 130/0.4 Volulyte
   (R), respectively. Pipe flow analysis found that all HES fluids
   displayed Newtonian behavior at 100\% concentrations. 25\%
   concentrations of both HES 130/0.4 fluids decreased analog viscosity
   23\%-29\% at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/s and 16\%-21\% at a flow rate of
   22.5 ml/s. At a flow rate of 22.5 ml/s, 25\% and 12.5\% concentrations
   of HES 260/0.45 resulted in analog viscosity changes of 3.9\%-4.5\%.
   Capillary viscosity reductions of approximately 7\% and 14.5\% in HES
   130/0.4 Voluven (R) and HES 260/0.45 suggest changes in molecular
   composition to batches previously measured. Maintenance of analog
   viscosity suggests that HES 260/0.45 would be suitable as a high
   viscosity plasma expander in extreme hemodilution through preservation

Abstract = {{We present color image processing methods for the analysis of images of
   dermatological lesions. The focus of this study is on the application of
   feature extraction and selection methods for classification and analysis
   of the tissue composition of skin lesions or ulcers, in terms of
   granulation (red), fibrin (yellow), necrotic (black), callous (white),
   and mixed tissue composition. The images were analyzed and classified by
   an expert dermatologist into the classes mentioned previously. Indexing
   of the images was performed based on statistical texture features
   derived from cooccurrence matrices of the red, green, and blue (RGB),
   hue, saturation, and intensity (HSI), L{*}a{*}b{*}, and L{*}u{*}v{*}
   color components. Feature selection methods were applied using the
   Wrapper algorithm with different classifiers. The performance of
   classification was measured in terms of the percentage of correctly
   classified images and the area under the receiver operating
   characteristic curve, with values of up to 73.8\% and 0.82,
   respectively.}},

Pages = {{554-560}},
Abstract = {{Multilevel inverters are gaining interest in industry, especially for
   renewable energy sources, as a means to reduce output distortion and
   also reduce electromagnetic interference effects. However, multilevel
   inverters have a high-transistor component count. In order to reduce the
   number of power transistors within a multilevel inverter, a bypass diode
   technique is suggested for two multilevel inverter topologies. In the
   first inverter configuration, referred to here as the diode-bypassed
   multilevel dc-link inverter, one H-bridge is required for the entire
   single-phase system, with one transistor and one bypass diode needed for
   each voltage source used in the inverter. Each voltage source
   contributes in supplying power to the load in both the positive and
   negative half cycles of the output waveform. In the second
   configuration, referred to here as the diode-bypassed neutral point
   inverter, one transistor and one bypass diode is required for each
   voltage source, plus two additional transistors for the entire
   single-phase inverter system. For this configuration, each dc source
   contributes only to one half-cycle of the output waveform, either
   positive or negative. For both configurations, it is possible to ensure
   even power distribution among all the voltage sources (or compensate for
   imbalance in the state of charge of the dc sources). Experimental
   results suggest the feasibility of constructing the proposed inverter
   topologies and simulations provide preliminary power-efficiency data.}},

Abstract = {{The constitutive modelling of granular materials both at the
   microstructural level and the continuum level is well established. Much
   recent effort has been devoted to the theoretical mechanics and computer
   simulations of granular media through discrete element modelling (DEM).
   The current study uses DEM to obtain theoretical insights and extract
   constitutive information such as the nature of the yield and plastic
   flow behaviour of granular materials. In particular, we look at the
   influence of granular fabric on the plastic deformation response under a
   number of conditions. As such, a representative element volume (REV) of
   a granular material idealized as a numerical DEM sample is subjected to
   different loading paths to reach the same stress states, but with
   different fabrics, on the plastic failure surface. At this stage,
   directional stress probes of equal magnitudes are applied, so that the
   strain response envelopes thus obtained represent characteristics of the
   increment of plastic strain, i.e. the nature of the flow rule. The
   discussion then focuses on the relationship between fabric, stress
   state, loading path, direction of the plastic strain increment, and
   whether this direction can be considered unique or not.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{We present a new adaptive method to calculate the path loss exponent
   (PLE) for microcell outdoor dynamic environments in the 2.4GHz
   Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) frequency band. The proposed
   method calculates the PLE during random walks by recording signal
   strength measurements from Radio Frequency (RF) transceivers and
   position data with a consumer-grade GPS receiver. The novelty of this
   work lies in the formulation of signal propagation conditions as a
   parametric observation model in order to estimate first the PLE and then
   the distance from the received RF signals using nonlinear least squares.
   GPS data is used to identify long term fading from the received signal's
   power and helps to refine the power-distance model. Ray tracing
   geometries for urban canyon (direct line of sight) and nonurban canyon
   (obstacles) propagation scenarios are used as the physics of the model
   (design matrix). Although the method was implemented for a lightweight
   localization algorithm for the 802.11b/g (Wi-Fi) standard, it can also
   be applied to other ISM band protocols such as 802.15.4 (Zigbee) and
   802.15.1 (Bluetooth).}},

Abstract = {{The electropolymerization of o-Phenylenediamine (oPDA), both in the
   absence and presence of Fe3+ in solution, was investigated in detail
   using cyclic voltammetry concurrently with the quartz crystal
   microbalance (QCMB) technique. It is shown that a set of redox peaks
   (A(1)/C-1), seen between 0.05 and 0.4 V is characteristic of the
   phenazine-like PoPDA polymer, produced by the irreversible radical
   oxidation of the oPDA monomer at a Au surface and forming an oPDA
   radical cation that initiates the polymerization step at >0.8 V vs. RBE.
   The QCMB results showed that ca. 20\% of the oxidized product deposits
   on the Au surface as a redox-active polymer film, with charge
   compensation by H+ injection/expulsion along with some
   inhalation/exhalation of water. The presence of Fe3+ in solution during
   electropolymerization led to very similar electrochemistry, with ca.
   50\% of the oxidized product forming the redox-active polymer film. The
   PoPDA films are very smooth and uniform, while films formed in the
   presence of Fe3+ are coated with Fe-containing nodules ca. 0.8 mu m in
   diameter, which hinder the further growth of the PoPDA film. (C) 2013

Title = {{Optimal Modeling and Filtering of Stochastic Time Series for Geoscience
   Applications}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{Sequences of observations or measurements are often modeled as
   realizations of stochastic processes with some stationary properties in
   the first and second moments. However in practice, the noise biases and
   variances are likely to be different for different epochs in time or
   regions in space, and hence such stationarity assumptions are often
   questionable. In the case of strict stationarity with equally spaced
   data, the Wiener-Hopf equations can readily be solved with fast Fourier
   transforms (FFTs) with optimal computational efficiency. In more general
   contexts, covariance matrices can also be diagonalized using the
   Karhunen-Loeve transforms (KLTs), or more generally using empirical
   orthogonal and biorthogonal expansions, which are unfortunately much
   more demanding in terms of computational efforts. In cases with
   increment stationarity, the mathematical modeling can be modified and
   generalized covariances can be used with some computational advantages.
   The general nonlinear solution methodology is also briefly overviewed
   with the practical limitations. These different formulations are
   discussed with special emphasis on the spectral properties of covariance
   matrices and illustrated with some numerical examples. General
   recommendations are included for practical geoscience applications.}},

Abstract = {{Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) not only have the ability to readily
   proliferate in culture, but also the potential to differentiate into all
   adult cell types and as such they are emerging as a promising cell
   source for tissue engineering applications. The spatial arrangement and
   temporal evolution of ESCs in laboratory cultures can be complex and
   often leads to heterogeneous cell densities and viabilities. This
   spatial heterogeneity influences factors such as mass transfer, creating
   nutrient gradients within the culture medium, which may in turn lead to
   variations in cell growth, viability, and differentiation. Methods which
   are available to accurately assess cell pluripotency (or lack thereof)
   include fixing and staining cells with antibodies for flow cytometry or
   immunocytochemistry, but these methods render the cells useless for
   further applications. The present research focuses on optimization of a
   novel non-invasive alternative tool to assess ESC colony pluripotency
   using fractal analysis. Here, we report preliminary results on the use
   of this image analysis technique to index cell growth and
   differentiation in human and mouse ESCs in static dishes to determine
   changes in the heterogeneity and complexity of a proliferating cell
   culture.}},

Abstract = {{The Android operating system is one of the most popular open-source
   platforms in the mobile operating system market. It had a worldwide
   smart-phone market share of 68\% at the second quarter of 2012. However,
   there has been little research on test coverage and test
   cost-effectiveness in this platform. The goal of this case study
   reported in this paper is to assess test coverage, fault detection
   effectiveness, test cost-effectiveness, and defect density in code-base
   of version 2.1 of the Android platform. We raise and address five
   research questions (RQs) in this study. Among our results are: (1) in
   contrary to what one would expect, for packages with larger coverage
   values (meaning more rigorous testing), it is not necessarily true that
   less defects have been reported by the users after release. Also, it is
   not necessarily true that components with low coverage have more
   defects; (2) we re-confirm (replicate) the existence of correlation
   between code coverage and mutation score, similar to existing studies;
   and (3) the package with the highest defect density (DD) in the Android
   code-base is Music (DD = 0.19 per 1 KLOC) and the package with the
   lowest DD value is ContactsProvider (DD = 0.0003). Results of our study
   will help us and other researchers to get a better view on test
   coverage, fault detection effectiveness, test cost-effectiveness, and
   defect density in Android code-base.}},

Abstract = {{Wind-powered electricity generation is growing at a high rate around the
   world, mainly driven by the associated environmental benefits. However,
   because of the uncertain nature of wind energy, large-scale integration
   of wind-powered generators into power systems introduces uncertainty of
   supply in the operation and planning of electric energy systems. A
   chance-constrained model is presented to study the strategic behavior of
   power suppliers (firms) with respect to the wind generation uncertainty
   in an electricity market. The linear complementarity problem of a
   Nash-Cournot competition is extended to account for the wind generation
   uncertainty. An iterative solution approach is introduced to solve the
   resultant joint chance-constrained programming problem. Five studies
   were conducted to show the impact of the amount, location and standard
   deviation of the wind generation and transmission line limits on the
   suppliers' profit in the Nash-Cournot game for different confidence
   levels. The value of stochastic solution index is used to evaluate the
   suppliers' loss of profit. The numerical results for a three-bus test
   system are given to verify the formulation and the solution approach.

   pitching plate}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTS IN FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The interaction between leading-edge-vortex and tip-vortex development
   on a low-aspect-ratio plate has been investigated and compared to a
   nominally two-dimensional rectangular flat plate. Simultaneous to force
   measurements, three-dimensional particle tracking velocimetry (3D-PTV)
   was used to characterize the instantaneous flow field on the suction
   side. An integration of the spanwise circulation distribution for the
   two-dimensional case indicates that the leading-edge-vortex formation
   process is correlated with the convective time and not with the
   instantaneous pitch angle. However, for the finite plate, it is found
   that the tip-vortex formation process is correlated with the
   instantaneous pitch angle instead. Since leading-edge vorticity is
   convected inboard by tip-vortex-induced spanwise velocity,
   leading-edge-vortex growth is found to be retarded in the tip region.
   Finally, with the aid of Lagrangian particle tracks, the leading-edge
   and tip vortices are found to grow distinct from one another, that is,
   no leading-edge vorticity is drawn into the tip vortex. However, the tip
   vortex is found to influence the leading-edge-vortex dynamics through
   inboard transport of leading-edge vorticity and is therefore responsible
   for vortex compression at the mid-span.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of location-based services provided by global navigation
   satellite systems is compromised by interference and multipath
   propagations. Although time/frequency interference suppression methods
   have been widely studied in the literature, they fail to cope with
   wideband interference signals. Instead, techniques utilising several
   antenna elements can be employed to mitigate both narrowband and
   broadband interference signals. However, the performance of beamforming
   techniques utilising antenna arrays severely degrades in dealing with
   correlated and coherent multipath components which cause signal
   cancellation phenomenon and temporal correlation matrix rank deficiency.
   This study proposes a two-stage beamformer to jointly deal with
   interference and multipath signals. In the first stage, before the
   despreading process, by applying the subspace method, the interference
   subspace is estimated and used as a constraint for the optimisation
   problem in the next stage. In the second stage, a modified version of
   the minimum power distortionless response beamformer employing several
   overlapping sub-arrays called the minimum difference output power method
   is utilised to mitigate the correlated multipath components. The
   proposed beamformer can deal with the signal cancellation phenomenon and
   temporal correlation matrix rank deficiency. Several simulation examples
   and a real data test are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed beamformer. Results show that the proposed method is able to
   put deep nulls in the direction of the narrowband and wideband
   interference signals, and significantly reduces the multipath-induced
   time of the arrival error.}},

Abstract = {{Co-gasification of biomass, namely, switchgrass, with coal and fluid
   coke was performed to investigate the availability of the gasification
   catalysts to the mixed feedstock, especially alkali and alkaline earth
   elements, naturally present on switchgrass. Rates of CO2 gasification of
   the single and mixed materials were measured at temperatures between 750
   and 950 degrees C and atmospheric pressure by thermogravimetry. High
   interparticle mobility of the catalysts is indicated by a prompt and
   lasting effect on the mixed feed gasification rate when compared with
   the separate rates. The switchgrass coal mixtures show a deactivation
   (antagonism), attributed to sequestration of the mobile alkali elements
   by reaction with aluminosilicate minerals in coal to form inactive
   alkali aluminosilicates, such as KAlSi3O8 and KAlSiO4. Remaining
   catalytic activity is evident when excess alkali is present in the feed
   mixture to satisfy the stoichiometric requirements of these deactivation
   reactions. In co-gasification of switchgrass with fluid coke, which has
   little interfering inorganic matter, a synergism is noted in the
   gasification of the mixed feed. The results document the effects of fuel
   mixture, composition of the coal or coke ash, and the gasification
   temperature on this behavior.}},

   Density Modulate Chondrocyte Volumetric Behaviour in Early
   Osteoarthritis}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate if the experimentally detected
   altered chondrocyte volumetric behavior in early osteoarthritis can be
   explained by changes in the extracellular and pericellular matrix
   properties of cartilage. Based on our own experimental tests and the
   literature, the structural and mechanical parameters for normal and
   osteoarthritic cartilage were implemented into a multiscale
   fibril-reinforced poroelastic swelling model. Model simulations were
   compared with experimentally observed cell volume changes in
   mechanically loaded cartilage, obtained from anterior cruciate ligament
   transected rabbit knees. We found that the cell volume increased by 7\%
   in the osteoarthritic cartilage model following mechanical loading of
   the tissue. In contrast, the cell volume decreased by 4\% in normal
   cartilage model. These findings were consistent with the experimental
   results. Increased local transversal tissue strain due to the reduced
   collagen fibril stiffness accompanied with the reduced fixed charge
   density of the pericellular matrix could increase the cell volume up to
   12\%. These findings suggest that the increase in the cell volume in
   mechanically loaded osteoarthritic cartilage is primarily explained by
   the reduction in the pericellular fixed charge density, while the
   superficial collagen fibril stiffness is suggested to contribute
   secondarily to the cell volume behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Pulsed gated vision systems are essential tools in obtaining images in
   obscure environmental conditions. Contrary to the existing gated
   systems, which use intensifiers and other external equipment, we present
   a design of gated sensor, which is implemented in a CMOS process. The
   proposed sensor is capable to filter out the objects according to their
   distance to the camera. This ability enables to remove the undesired
   reflections and to see more clearly the target. Such gated vision
   principle is implemented using a unique multishuttering regime. Various
   properties of this regime such as charge-transfer mechanisms, frequency
   of switching, pulsewidth, slew rate, etc., are described and thoroughly
   analyzed. Upon the performed analysis, we optimize the shape of the
   shutter pulses and substantially reduce the charge-transfer time. A 128
   x 256 CMOS gated image sensor was fabricated in 0.18-mu m process and
   successfully tested. The included experimental results fully corroborate
   with the theory, showing the sensor functionality and proving the
   feasibility of the proposed design.}},

Abstract = {{Pompe disease (lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency) in
   adolescents and adults presents primarily with muscle weakness. Bone
   weakness is an under-recognized finding in patients with Pompe disease,
   but there is emerging evidence that loss of muscle function and mobility
   can lead to loss of mineral content and a higher risk of fracture. In
   addition to the mineral content, architecture is also important in
   determining the overall strength of the bone. We present the results of
   the longest longitudinal duration study to date using a novel
   application of high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed
   tomography (HR-pQCT) in four patients with Pompe disease over 4 years of
   observation during the normal course of their disease management. The
   subjects varied in treatment status with recombinant human
   alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA), use of anti-resorptive therapy (such as
   bisphosphonates), mobility and weight-bearing status, and the use of
   side-alternating vibration therapy. Our observations were that HR-pQCT
   can measure trends in mineral density and architecture over a long
   period of observation and may be an early indicator of the response to
   interventional therapies. In addition, a combination of decreased
   loading forces due to decreased mobility likely contributes to the
   compromise of bone integrity in Pompe disease. These trends can be
   reversed by applying increased loading forces such as vibration therapy
   and maintaining weight-bearing and mobility. We conclude that HR-pQCT
   can serve as a valuable tool to monitor bone health in patients with
   Pompe disease.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in the performance of VLSI circuits are leading to a number of
   emerging applications of multidimensional (MD) filters. Early progress
   was focused on the numerical design of two dimensional (2-D) transfer
   functions and the challenging stability issues associated with
   low-complexity infinite impulse response (IIR) implementations. However,
   over the last decade or so, important practical advances have occurred
   in the design of 3-D and 4-D IIR filters, leading to some important
   emerging applications. In this tutorial article, some of these
   applications are described, with emphasis on 2-D spatio-temporal
   beamforming and 4-D light field processing. In particular, advances in
   spatio-temporal beamforming for cognitive radio systems and for
   synthetic aperture radio telescopes are considered. In the 4-D case, we
   describe a class of 4-D light field filters for image processing, 4-D
   hyper-fan filters for low-light imaging, depth filtering, denoising and
   the attenuation of distracting objects, with applications in
   computational photography and habitat monitoring. Both analog and
   digital systolic VLSI circuit implementations are described with
   emphasis on recent progress using field programmable gate array
   (FPGA)-based and digital VLSI circuits that can potentially operate at
   radio frequencies in the multi-GHz range. These new innovations open up
   exciting possibilities for real-time MD filters having frames rates in
   the multi-GHz for emerging radio frequency (RF) antenna signal
   processing and imaging systems.}},

Abstract = {{The design of compact and reconfigurable radio transceivers with low
   power consumption and low cost is a challenging task in future wireless
   communications systems. Transceiver architectures that are amenable to
   high-level integration will inevitably suffer from various radio
   frequency (RF) impairments, which limits the communications system
   performance and hence hinders their wide-spread use in commercial
   products. In this paper, we present the mitigation of RF impairments as
   a system identification problem. Four major classes of RF impairments
   are presented: power amplifier (PA) nonlinearity, in-phase/quadrature
   (I/Q) impairments, group delay distortion, and carrier frequency offset
   and phase noise. Their models and up-to-date identification techniques
   are described here. In particular, various nonlinear signal processing
   techniques that are effective in mitigating these impairments are also
   presented here. Theoretical and experimental results show that these
   mitigation techniques can significantly improve the communications
   system performance.}},

Abstract = {{Robots are becoming increasingly relevant to neurosurgeons, extending a
   neurosurgeon's physical capabilities, improving navigation within the
   surgical landscape when combined with advanced imaging, and propelling
   the movement toward minimally invasive surgery. Most surgical robots,
   however, isolate surgeons from the full range of human senses during a
   procedure. This forces surgeons to rely on vision alone for guidance
   through the surgical corridor, which limits the capabilities of the
   system, requires significant operator training, and increases the
   surgeon's workload. Incorporating haptics into these systems, ie,
   enabling the surgeon to ``feel{''} forces experienced by the tool tip of
   the robot, could render these limitations obsolete by making the robot
   feel more like an extension of the surgeon's own body. Although the use
   of haptics in neurosurgical robots is still mostly the domain of
   research, neurosurgeons who keep abreast of this emerging field will be
   more prepared to take advantage of it as it becomes more prevalent in
   operating theaters. Thus, this article serves as an introduction to the
   field of haptics for neurosurgeons. We not only outline the current and
   future benefits of haptics but also introduce concepts in the fields of
   robotic technology and computer control. This knowledge will allow
   readers to be better aware of limitations in the technology that can
   affect performance and surgical outcomes, and ``knowing the right
   questions to ask{''} will be invaluable for surgeons who have purchasing
   power within their departments.}},

Abstract = {{The electrochemical behavior of the redox couple ferro/ferricyanide has
   been investigated in aqueous 1.0M KNO3 and in (w/o) microemulsion using
   cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA). The (w/o)
   microemulsion was composed of the non-ionic surfactant Tween-80,
   tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) supporting electrolyte, HepTol,
   and dichloromethane as the continuous phase and the aqueous probe
   solution. In the aqueous supporting electrolyte solution of 1.0M KNO3,
   the redox pair showed a reversible electrochemical behavior and followed
   Randles-Sevcik and Cottrell equations, however, with
   concentration-dependent diffusion coefficients. In the (w/o)
   microemulsion system, on the other hand, the probe showed an
   irreversible behavior mainly due to the adsorption of surfactant onto
   the working electrode, which hindered the charge transfer step. The
   presence of dispersed Ni nanoparticles in the aqueous solution did not
   have an effect on the electrochemical behavior of the redox couple,
   while it enhanced the reduction decay current in the (w/o)
   microemulsions. This observation was attributed to a more rapid charge
   transfer in a medium with inherently very low conductivity.}},

Title = {{Recent Advances in Computational Mechanics of the Human Knee Joint}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{Computational mechanics has been advanced in every area of orthopedic
   biomechanics. The objective of this paper is to provide a general review
   of the computational models used in the analysis of the mechanical
   function of the knee joint in different loading and pathological
   conditions. Major review articles published in related areas are
   summarized first. The constitutive models for soft tissues of the knee
   are briefly discussed to facilitate understanding the joint modeling. A
   detailed review of the tibiofemoral joint models is presented
   thereafter. The geometry reconstruction procedures as well as some
   critical issues in finite element modeling are also discussed.
   Computational modeling can be a reliable and effective method for the
   study of mechanical behavior of the knee joint, if the model is
   constructed correctly. Single-phase material models have been used to
   predict the instantaneous load response for the healthy knees and
   repaired joints, such as total and partial meniscectomies, ACL and PCL
   reconstructions, and joint replacements. Recently, poromechanical models
   accounting for fluid pressurization in soft tissues have been proposed
   to study the viscoelastic response of the healthy and impaired knee
   joints. While the constitutive modeling has been considerably advanced
   at the tissue level, many challenges still exist in applying a good
   material model to three-dimensional joint simulations. A complete model
   validation at the joint level seems impossible presently, because only
   simple data can be obtained experimentally. Therefore, model validation
   may be concentrated on the constitutive laws using multiple mechanical
   tests of the tissues. Extensive model verifications at the joint level
   are still crucial for the accuracy of the modeling.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Different suspension systems that are used within prosthetic
   devices may alter the distribution of pressure inside the prosthetic
   socket in lower limb amputees. This study aimed to compare the interface
   pressure of a new magnetic suspension system with the pin/lock and
   Seal-In suspension systems.
   Methods: Twelve unilateral transtibial amputees participated in the
   study. The subjects walked on a level walkway at a self-selected speed.
   The resultant peak pressure with the three different suspension systems
   was recorded using F-socket transducers.
   Findings: There were significant statistical differences between the
   three studied suspension systems. Pair-wise analyses revealed that the
   mean peak pressure (kPa) was lower with the magnetic system than it was
   with the pin/lock system over the anterior and posterior aspects during
   one gait cycle (89.89 vs. 79.26 and 47.22 vs. 26.01, respectively).
   Overall, the average peak pressure values were higher with the Seal-In
   system than they were with the new magnetic lock and pin/lock system.
   Interpretation: The new magnetic system might reduce the pressure within
   the prosthetic socket in comparison to the pin/lock and Seal-In system
   during one gait cycle. This is particularly important during the swing
   phase of gait and may reduce the pain and discomfort at the distal
   residual limb in comparison to the pin/lock system. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Title = {{Altered Knee Joint Mechanics in Simple Compression Associated with Early
   Cartilage Degeneration}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{The progression of osteoarthritis can be accompanied by depth-dependent
   changes in the properties of articular cartilage.. e objective of the
   present study was to determine the subsequent alteration in the fluid
   pressurization in the human knee using a three-dimensional computer
   model. Only a small compression in the femur-tibia direction was applied
   to avoid numerical difficulties.. e material model for articular
   cartilages and menisci included fluid, fibrillar and nonfibrillar
   matrices as distinct constituents.. e knee model consisted of distal
   femur, femoral cartilage, menisci, tibial cartilage, and proximal tibia.
   Cartilage degeneration was modeled in the high load-bearing region of
   the medial condyle of the femur with reduced fibrillar and nonfibrillar
   elastic properties and increased hydraulic permeability. Three case
   studies were implemented to simulate (1) the onset of cartilage
   degeneration from the superficial zone, (2) the progression of cartilage
   degeneration to the middle zone, and (3) the progression of cartilage
   degeneration to the deep zone. As compared with a normal knee of the
   same compression, reduced fluid pressurization was observed in the
   degenerated knee. Furthermore, faster reduction in fluid pressure was
   observed with the onset of cartilage degeneration in the superficial
   zone and progression to the middle zone, as compared to progression to
   the deep zone. On the other hand, cartilage degeneration in any zone
   would reduce the fluid pressure in all three zones.. e shear strains at
   the cartilage-bone interface were increased when cartilage degeneration
   was eventually advanced to the deep zone.. e present study revealed, at
   the joint level, altered fluid pressurization and strains with the
   depth-wise cartilage degeneration.. e results also indicated
   redistribution of stresses within the tissue and relocation of the
   loading between the tissue matrix and fluid pressure.. These results may
   only be qualitatively interesting due to the small compression
   considered.}},

Title = {{Recent advances in electrocatalysts for electro-oxidation of ammonia}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{3216-3238}},
Abstract = {{The electro-oxidation of ammonia has attracted much attention in recent
   years since it addresses both the clean energy supply free of COx and
   environmental protection. However, the large-scale applications of
   ammonia electro-oxidation technologies have been strongly hindered by
   the insufficient performance and the high cost of the electrocatalysts
   related to the usage of high Pt loadings. Therefore, considerable effort
   has been devoted to developing electrocatalysts for ammonia
   electro-oxidation with improved activity and lower Pt loading over the
   past 10 years. From the initial focus on pure metal electrocatalysts, a
   wide range of Pt-based and Pt-free electrocatalysts for ammonia
   electro-oxidation have been investigated. This review begins with a
   brief discussion on the mechanism of the ammonia electro-oxidation with
   particular attention on the latest findings on the active intermediates
   and poisoning species, which is important for the fundamental
   understanding of the principles of improving the electrocatalyst
   performance for ammonia electro-oxidation. Typical types of
   electrocatalysts for ammonia electro-oxidation are next described,
   including pure metal, Pt alloy and Pt-free electrocatalysts. The various
   preparation methods are discussed and related to the resulting
   structures and electrocatalytic properties for ammonia
   electro-oxidation. The factors influencing the performance of the
   electrocatalysts are also highlighted for gaining fundamental insight
   into the optimization of the electrocatalyst performance. Based on the
   results achieved in this area, several future research directions are
   finally proposed and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In a previous study (Clarkson 2009), advanced production-analysis
   techniques, including production type curves and flowing material
   balance (FMB), were applied to Horseshoe Canyon (HSC) coal wells to
   establish the applicability of these techniques and to resolve the
   importance of multilayer behaviour for production analysis. The field
   examples chosen for analysis included single wells that exhibited
   production declines analogous to shallow gas wells, with decline in
   production occurring from day 1, and in one case exhibiting
   transient-flow characteristics. There are many more HSC wells that
   exhibit less-straightforward production characteristics, including flat
   or even inclining production. These wells have production profiles
   qualitatively similar to two-phase coalbed-methane (CBM) wells, yet lack
   water production. There are several possible explanations for the flat
   or inclining production behaviour, including changing skin associated
   with near-wellbore cleanup of drilling fluids over time, and increase in
   absolute permeability associated with matrix shrinkage. Regardless of
   the cause, these effects need to be accounted for in quantitative
   production analysis.
   In this follow-up paper, we continue to perform comparisons between
   multilayer and single-layer-equivalent production analysis of HSC wells,
   but focus on wells that exhibit inclining gas production. We develop a
   methodology to correct for changing skin in both type-curve and FMB
   analyses that allows this more-complex well behaviour to be analyzed. We
   validate the new methodology using a simulated example, and then apply
   it to actual field cases. Changing skin and absolute permeability by
   layer/coal zone was quantified through periodic shut-in/buildup testing
   of isolated coals throughout the life of the wells, and these dynamic
   properties were used in production-data analysis and analytical
   simulation. Comparing single-layer-equivalent and multilayer analysis,
   we have found differences in estimated-ultimate-recovery (EUR) values of
   less than 15\% because the existence of one or two dominant (high-kh)
   coal zones. Additionally, we investigated the impact of free-gas storage
   on the results of production-data analysis of HSC wells.
   The production-analysis methodology introduced in this work, while
   useful for analyzing HSC coal wells with dynamic skin/permeability, is
   expected to be applicable to a broader range of reservoir types that
   exhibit this complex behaviour.}},

Journal = {{MEASUREMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{46}},

Abstract = {{The strapdown gyrocompass can provide attitude by measuring the Earth's
   gravity vector. In practical applications, there usually exists unwanted
   disturbance accelerometers that will distort the accelerometer
   measurements, hence a filtering out procedure is essential. Current
   attitude determination method based on pendulum cutting off technology
   has the limitation for vehicle moving mode. This paper proposes a new
   strapdown gyrocompass algorithm via processing the accelerometer
   measurement with Butterworth low-pass filter (LPF) to remove the high
   frequency dynamic disturbance components. When the gravity variation in
   inertial frame is regulated, LPF can be applied to properly get the
   gravity even in the presence of acceleration disturbances, and
   subsequently can be applied to calculate the strapdown gyrocompass
   attitude. The proposed algorithm does not require declination
   information and inertial element biases estimation. The field test has
   been conducted and the results verified the effectiveness and
   reliability of the proposed AUV attitude determination method and have
   also shown that the gravity is proportional to the latitude and altitude
   of AUV. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental investigation of Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) confined
   concrete is normally conducted on relatively small-scale specimens,
   where the scaling effects of the specimen size are usually ignored. Few
   researchers investigated the scaling effects of confined concrete with
   Carbon FRP (CFRP), Glass FRP (GFRP) and Aramid FRP (AFRP) sheets.
   However, based on the authors' knowledge, there is no information
   available in the literature on the slenderness effects of confined
   concrete with Steel FRP (SFRP) sheet. The SFRP sheet is a new type of
   material recently introduced for strengthening applications of concrete
   structures. Thus, the main aim of this investigation is to quantify and
   access the axial strength, axial strain, hoop strain, dilation and
   ductility performance of SFRP confined concrete with the increase in the
   slenderness of the specimens. The experimental program included eighteen
   specimens with varying slenderness ratios (height-to-diameter ratio) of
   2 (150 mm x 300 mm), 4 (150 mm x 600 mm), and 6 (150 mm x 900 mm). Six
   specimens were constructed in each size, where three specimens were left
   unwrapped as control specimens and three specimens were wrapped with
   SFRP sheets. All specimens were loaded in uniaxial compression until
   failure. The specimens were also instrumented with a photogrammetric
   method termed Digital Image Correlation Technique to measure the hoop
   strains from the surface of the SFRP confined concrete specimens. The
   experimental investigation showed that the effectiveness of the SFRP
   sheets, measured in terms of the percentage increase in the ultimate
   axial strength, axial and hoop strains, and the ductility was
   significantly enhanced compared to the unwrapped specimens. The results
   also indicate that the overall performance of the SFRP wrapped concrete
   specimens was reduced with the increase in the slenderness of the
   specimens, when compared to the standard size cylinders. The study of
   three major design codes/guidelines to predict the ultimate
   SFRP-confined concrete compressive strength revealed that the FRP
   Building Code has the best confinement model when compared with the
   experimental results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A scaled line-based kernel density estimator for the retrieval of
   utilization distributions and home ranges from GPS movement tracks}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Pages = {{1-8}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Utilization distributions (UDs) can be used to describe the intensity
   with which an animal or human has used a certain geographical location.
   Within the domain of wildlife ecology, a density distribution model
   represents one way to describe an animals' home range. Several methods
   have been developed to derive UDs, and subsequently home ranges. Most of
   these methods, e.g. kernel density estimation (KDE), and local convex
   hull methods, have been developed with point-based datasets in mind, and
   do not utilize additional information that comes with GPS-based tracking
   data (e.g., temporal information). To employ such additional information
   we extend the point-based KDE approach to work with sequential GPS-point
   tracks, the outcome of which is a line-based KDE. We first describe the
   design criteria for the line-KDE algorithm. Then we introduce the basic
   modeling approach and its refinement through the introduction of a
   scaling function. This scaling function modifies the utilization
   distribution so that a bone-like probability distribution for a single
   GPS track segment is obtained. Finally we compare the estimated
   utilization distributions and home ranges for two datasets derived using
   our line-KDE approach with those obtained using the point-KDE and
   Brownian Bridge (BB) approaches. Advantages of the line-based KDE by
   design are (i) a better representation of utilization density near GPS
   points when compared against the BB approach, and (ii) the ability to
   model and retain movement corridors when compared against point-KDE. (C)

Journal = {{COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{94-101}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In the majority of fatal avalanches, skiers and snowmobilers apply load
   to the snow cover which triggers the initial failure in a weak layer.
   Understanding how the stress due to the dynamic surface load transmits
   through the snow cover can help people avoid situations where they can
   trigger avalanches. Capacitive sensors were used to measure this stress
   within the mountain snow cover. The three main variables affecting
   stress transmission through the snow cover investigated in this paper
   are the type of loading, depth and snow cover stratigraphy. At specific
   depths, snowmobiles added more stress than skiers did, thus increasing
   the probability of initiating a fracture in a weak layer and releasing a
   slab avalanche. The increased penetration depth of snowmobiles into the
   snow cover compared to skiers was the primary reason for this increase
   in stress. A decrease in stress was observed with increasing depth. A
   decrease in stress was observed with increased snow cover hardness.
   Supportive surface layers created a `bridging effect' that spread stress
   out laterally and decreased the depth to which it penetrated. (C) 2012

Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{173-183}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The increasing use of Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) for strengthening
   applications initiates the need to study the behavior of the
   strengthened members when subjected to fatigue loading. A general
   Fatigue Prediction Model (FPM) of Reinforced Concrete (RC) beams
   strengthened using prestressed FRP reinforcement was developed and
   presented in this paper. The damage effect was quantified into certain
   variables which can be determined analytically and/or experimentally.
   The developed model is applicable for any type of FRP strengthening. It
   accounts for the degradation in the concrete stress-strain relationship
   and the degradation of the epoxy-concrete and the steel-concrete bonds.
   The model was calibrated with experimental test results of RC beams
   strengthened using prestressed Near-Surface-Mounted (NSM) carbon FRP
   strips followed by performing a parametric study concerning the
   different model variables. It was found that the developed model
   accounts properly for the non-linearity in the strain variation across
   the depth of the RC strengthened beams as well as the effect of changing
   the prestress level when subjected to fatigue loading. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Cross-band modulation effects in the concurrent dual-band transmitters
   are quite noticeable for the linearization. This paper proposes a novel
   two-dimensional modified memory polynomial (2D-MMP) technique to
   compensate for nonlinear distortion in the concurrent dual-band
   transmitters. By taking into account the cross-band modulation effects,
   the 2D-MMP model is developed by properly modifying the envelope terms
   of the conventional memory polynomial (MP) model. This makes the model
   complexity of the 2D-MMP model significantly reduced compared to the
   prior 2D-DPD model in previous work. However, the linearization ability
   of the 2D-MMP model is still retained. Simulations prove that the 2D-MMP
   model is quite robust to different PA models. Experimental measurements
   were carried out for a dual-band class-AB PA exhibiting mild
   nonlinearity and a highly nonlinear dual-band Doherty PA. The results
   show that the 2D-MMP model can achieve nearly the same linearization
   accuracy compared to the 2D-DPD model, with much less coefficients. Less
   than -52 dBc adjacent channel power ratios (ACPRs) for the dual-band
   class-AB power amplifiers (PAs) and -50 dBc ACPRs for the dual-band
   Doherty PA in the dual bands were achieved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the effects of alternating current (AC) on the performance
   of cathodic protection (CP) and the CP potential readings were
   investigated on a 16Mn pipeline steel in a simulated soil solution. The
   presence of AC interference decreases the CP effectiveness to protect
   the steel from corrosion. Only when CP potential is sufficiently
   negative, the steel is under a complete protection even when the AC
   current density is 400 A/m(2). Moreover, the AC would shift CP potential
   from the designed value. The effect of AC on the CP performance depends

   water is computed from local rainfall data and a model of rain
   accumulation and discharge in the ground. The effect of the vertical
   motions of the ground is estimated using time-series of permanent Global
   Positioning System (GPS) stations and the theoretical gravity to height
   ratio of -2 mu Gal cm(-1). Unexpectedly, Morakot typhoon (2009 August),
   the strongest typhoon in Taiwan in 50 yr, was responsible for the
   highest gravity changes. Morakot triggered numerous large landslides and

Abstract = {{Parameters useful for the diagnosis of pathological processes leading to
   the deterioration of the articular cartilage surfaces of knee joints,
   such as osteoarthritis, may be derived from vibroarthrographic (VAG)
   signals. In the present work, we explore fractal analysis to
   parameterize the temporal and spectral variability of normal and
   abnormal VAG signals. The power spectrum analysis method was used with
   the 1/f model to derive estimates of the fractal dimension (FD).
   Classification accuracy of up to 0.74 was obtained with a single FD
   parameter, in terms of the area under the receiver operating
   characteristic curve (A(z)), with a database of 89 VAG signals.
   Combinations of the features derived in the present work with other
   features we have reported upon recently, when used with several neural
   networks with radial basis functions, resulted in A(z) values in the
   range {[}0.92, 0.96], with an exceptional case of perfect classification
   with A(z) = 1.0. The proposed methods could help in the detection and

   Limited. Both examined probe-based and detector-based ramp metering
   approaches adopt the same problem formulation; however, they differ by
   the data source that provides estimates of their input parameters. The
   probe-based approach takes as main input space mean speed extracted from
   vehicle probes moving constantly on the entire freeway. The
   detector-based approach takes the density readings directly from point
   detectors placed upstream and downstream of each on-ramp. The developed
   approach formulates the ramp metering rates to simultaneously reduce
   freeway travel time and decrease delays on ramps. A dynamic weighting
   scheme is adopted in this formulation to give different weighting
   schemes to the various freeway sections and the on-ramps. These weights
   are able to adjust dynamically based on prevailing and forecasted
   traffic conditions to give priority in each step to the sections of the
   freeways or/and on-ramps experiencing critical traffic conditions. The
   comparative analysis of the three ramp metering approaches was conducted
   on an 8-km freeway section on Highway 2 in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The
   results of the analysis indicate that the probe-based algorithm
   consistently outperformed the two other approaches in terms of all
   performance measures. The probe-based approach is shown to exceed the
   performance of the detector-based approach with a market share of
   vehicle probes as low as 3\%. The results of the analysis are promising
   and show the effectiveness of developing ramp metering control
   algorithms taking the main input parameters from vehicle probes on the
   freeway. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Automated Real-Time Monitoring System to Measure Shift Production of

Abstract = {{The productivity of a tunnel construction project can deviate from the
   predicted plan due to many factors, such as equipment failure, weather
   conditions and unexpected soil characteristics. Early detection of such
   deviations can help management teams to reallocate resources and take
   necessary actions to maximize the productivity. The real-time monitoring
   of actual productivity would yield tremendous information toward this
   end, but such monitoring is difficult, especially with remote
   construction sites. Therefore, the common practice has been to
   periodically obtain manually generated aggregated productivity reports
   from sites. These aggregated reports are not available to both site and
   office management in real time and may lack detailed information. To
   avoid these drawbacks, the research presented in this paper proposes an
   automated tunnel construction monitoring system to measure the
   productivity of the tunnel construction in terms of shift production
   (meters/shift). This system computes the shift production in real time
   using time-lapsed images of a tunnel construction site and provides
   instant access to these reports through a secure web portal. The web
   portal also shows video clips of remote site activities. The reports
   generated by the system can be verified without obtaining any additional
   input from the sites. This paper describes the design of the proposed
   system in detail, including its principles, image processing algorithms,
   system architecture, and user interface details. System operation is
   illustrated using real examples. Validation results are presented and
   analyzed at the algorithmic level as well as at the system level. DOI:

Abstract = {{A new time-based high-speed data-link architecture, which we call
   Differential time Signaling (DTS) is presented. A clock pulse is
   embedded in the transmitted signal and is used as a time reference
   against which the rising and falling data pulse edge timings are
   compared. Using the DTS approach, data encoding is achieved by spacing
   the time between the embedded clock edges and the data pulse edges using
   a hierarchical time-delay resolution assignment to each bit in the data
   sequence. The proposed link is shown to concentrate the signal energy in
   a low bandwidth while reducing clock jitter effect. A simulated 3 Gb/s
   90 nm CMOS DTS link using a 500 MHz clock signal is also described to
   provide a flavor for a monolithic realization. As a proof of concept,
   700 Mb/s and 1.6 Gb/s DTS-based links have been designed using a
   commercial FPGA board. The measured eye diagrams for the transmitted and
   received signals over a 40-inch FR4 channel are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Architectural distortion is an important sign of early breast cancer. We
   present methods for computer-aided detection of architectural distortion
   in mammograms acquired prior to the diagnosis of breast cancer in the
   interval between scheduled screening sessions.
   Potential sites of architectural distortion were detected using node
   maps obtained through the application of a bank of Gabor filters and
   linear phase portrait modeling. A total of 4,224 regions of interest
   (ROIs) were automatically obtained from 106 prior mammograms of 56
   interval-cancer cases, including 301 true-positive ROIs, and from 52
   mammograms of 13 normal cases. Each ROI was represented by three types
   of entropy measures of angular histograms composed with the Gabor
   magnitude response, angle, coherence, orientation strength, and the
   angular spread of power in the Fourier spectrum, including Shannon's
   entropy, Tsallis entropy for nonextensive systems, and R,nyi entropy for
   extensive systems.
   Using the entropy measures with stepwise logistic regression and the
   leave-one-patient-out method for feature selection and cross-validation,
   an artificial neural network resulted in an area under the receiver
   operating characteristic curve of 0.75. Free-response receiver operating
   characteristics indicated a sensitivity of 0.80 at 5.2 false positives
   (FPs) per patient.
   The proposed methods can detect architectural distortion in prior
   mammograms taken 15 months (on the average) before clinical diagnosis of
   breast cancer, with a high sensitivity and a moderate number of FPs per
   patient. The results are promising and may be improved with additional
   features to characterize subtle abnormalities and larger databases
   including prior mammograms.}},

   aerial vehicles, having lateral and longitudinal rotor tilting

   pitch, yaw, and roll stability of the vehicle. Such control mechanisms
   enables the UAV to perform complex tasks that no other Unmanned Aerial
   Vehicles (UAVs) can execute such as hover pitched. This control tactic
   allows the vehicle under investigation, eVader, to use the full
   potential of its flying characteristics enabled by the novel dual-axis
   oblique active tilting (OAT) mechanism, which enables it to maneuver
   inside obstructed environments. The potential of the eVader as a small
   UAV and its model are verified and then used to for autonomous take-off
   and landing as well as stabilizing the vehicle's attitude. Finally,
   diverse simulation scenarios on attitude and position control,

Abstract = {{Biofilm growth in subsurface porous media, and its treatment with
   biocides (antimicrobial agents), involves a complex interaction of
   biogeochemical processes which provide non-trivial mathematical
   modelling challenges. Although there are literature reports of
   mathematical models to evaluate biofilm tolerance to biocides, none of
   these models have investigated biocide treatment of biofilms growing in
   interconnected porous media with flow. In this paper, we present a
   numerical investigation using a pore network model of biofilm growth,
   formation damage and biocide treatment. The model includes three phases
   (aqueous, adsorbed biofilm, and solid matrix), a single growth-limiting
   nutrient and a single biocide dissolved in the water. Biofilm is assumed
   to contain a single species of microbe, in which each cell can be a
   viable persister, a viable non-persister, or non-viable (dead).
   Persisters describe small subpopulation of cells which are tolerant to
   biocide treatment. Biofilm tolerance to biocide treatment is regulated
   by persister cells and includes innate and biocide-induced factors.
   Simulations demonstrate that biofilm tolerance to biocides can increase
   with biofilm maturity, and that biocide treatment alone does not reverse
   biofilm-induced formation damage. Also, a successful application of
   biological permeability conformance treatment involving geologic layers
   with flow communication is more complicated than simply engineering the
   attachment of biofilm-forming cells at desired sites.}},

Abstract = {{Precise descriptions of the thermodynamic properties of pure fluids
   require accurate definition of vapourpressure and phase volumes as well
   as residual volumes, enthalpies and entropies. While carefully fitted
   multi-parameter equations of state (EOS), such as
   BenedictWebbRubinStarling fulfil these requirements, cubic EOSs usually
   do not. On the other hand, cubic EOSs are widely used in the oil
   industry, due to their simplicity and reliability in most vapourliquid
   equilibrium calculations. For thermal oil recovery processes and the
   natural gas industry, the choice of EOS becomes important for predicting
   thermodynamic properties, such as isobaric and isochoric heat
   capacities, sound velocity and the JouleThomson coefficient. In this
   study, eight cubic EOSs which most of them are used in commercial
   reservoir simulators are selected for evaluation of their capability in
   the prediction of second-order derivative thermodynamic properties at
   different temperatures and pressures, using pure components frequently
   found in petroleum and natural gas mixtures. It is shown that none of
   the cubic EOSs could accurately predict all of the stated parameters,
   especially below the critical point. All EOSs failed to show the extrema
   in the derivative properties. However, among these equations the YuLu
   and SchmidtWenzel EOSs were found to have more reliable predictions in
   most of the cases. (c) 2011 Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering}},

Abstract = {{We tested the hypothesis that immediate reattachment of the native
   anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) can prevent kinematic changes and the
   development of osteoarthritis (OA). Five sheep underwent anatomic
   unilateral ACL reconstruction (ACL-R). Animals from a previous study
   served as sham (n = 7) or non-operated (n = 17) controls. At 4 points of
   walking gait, 6 degrees of freedom stifle joint kinematics of ACL-R
   animals were compared with sham controls at 4 and 20 weeks post-surgery.
   Gross cartilage, bone, and meniscal changes were graded at euthanasia;
   paired and differential scores were compared. Inter-animal differences
   were noted in all groups. Of 48 points of gait comparison between ACL-R
   and sham operated groups, 42 points showed no difference (p > 0.05). Of
   the six significant differences (p < 0.05), internal rotation in ACL-R
   animals accounted for three. At 20 weeks, differential scores showed
   that sham operated joints were morphologically indistinguishable from
   non-operated controls (p = 0.129) while ACL-R joints had significantly
   higher combined cartilage and osteophyte scores than those controls (p =
   0.003). This method of ACL reconstruction in sheep did not restore
   normal walking gait kinematics completely and allowed some OA to develop
   in operated joints. OA may result from relatively subtle mechanical
   abnormalities, apparently more so in some individuals than others. (c)

   microscopic traffic simulation model. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is chosen
   as the solution method for solving the stochastic nonlinear optimization
   problem. A high-performance computing cluster is used to run GA in
   parallel computer processing engines. The application of the framework
   on a large case-study network showed that the incorporation of speed
   data from in-vehicle navigation systems improves significantly the
   calibration performance in terms of improved accuracy of estimated
   counts and speed. In addition, the incorporation of speed data makes the
   calibration problem less dependent on the starting OD flows. Finally,
   the application of a distributed GA was shown to significantly reduce
   the computational time of the calibration of DTA systems.}},

Abstract = {{Radio-frequency (RF) digital phased array antennas are highly-useful for
   achieving electronically-scanned smart antenna apertures with
   applications in radar, signal intelligence, microwave and mm-wave
   imaging and wireless communication systems. However, digital phased
   array algorithms are of high computational complexity, which leads to
   correspondingly high circuit complexity in a VLSI implementation. A 2-D
   IIR beam space-time plane-wave digital filter can achieve the required
   electronically-scanned RF beams albeit at an order of magnitude lower
   circuit complexity compared to phased arrays at the cost of non-linear
   phase response. The proposed method approximately rectifies the
   non-linearity in the phase response using an FFT-based phase
   compensation method which linearises the response at higher frequencies
   close to the Nyquist limit where the phase non-linearity is worst in the
   beam filter response. FPGA prototypes using a Xilinx Virtex-4
   Sx35-10ff668 device on an XtremeDSP Kit-4 are provided, which show

   to measure the angular covariance between rose diagrams related to the
   phase and magnitude responses of multidirectional Gabor filters. A set
   of 128 mammograms from the DDSM database, including 32 normal and 32
   asymmetric pairs, was used to validate the procedure. The
   leave-one-patient-out method was used for cross-validation of the
   results. The best result, with an area under the receiver operating

   The techniques implemented include multiscale vesselness measures and
   Gabor filters. The selection of an appropriate threshold is crucial for
   accurate detection of retinal blood vessels. We propose an adaptive
   threshold selection method for this purpose. We also propose a
   postprocessing technique for removal of false-positive pixels around the
   optic nerve head. Values of the area under the receiver operating
   characteristic curve of up to 0.9616 were obtained using the 20 test
   images of the DRIVE database.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a tractable analytical framework for investigating the
   energy efficiency (EE) of a 2-tier heterogeneous cellular network
   consisting of macro and picocell base stations (BS) is developed. The
   BSs, which are randomly distributed, serve a number of users in the
   downlink under shared spectrum operation. By incorporating a tunable
   downlink power control mechanism, the successful transmission
   probability and the average throughput achievable in both tiers are
   analytically derived. Since varying load conditions has an important
   implication on the network performance, the EE is investigated as a
   function of the load level, considering the ability to transfer the load
   between the 2 tiers. An optimization problem that maximizes the
   throughput constrained 2-tier EE is formulated and solved to determine
   the optimal network operational parameters. In addition to providing
   valuable design insights, the findings reveal that, for different load
   conditions, it is feasible to significantly enhance the EE performance
   by optimally adapting the network configuration.}},

Abstract = {{Social networks are ever-growing systems by inheritance. The increase in
   the number nodes in these systems often brings forth the need to add
   additional functionalities. However due to the distributed nature of
   social networks, system growth can be a challenging task. Therefore
   scalability of the system is of vital importance in the design of social
   networks. This research attempts to establish a comprehensive framework
   for analysis and validation of requirements and design documents for
   software systems. In previous work, we applied this framework to analyze
   the requirements of a social network of agents; expressed using
   scenario-based specifications. Scenarios are appealing because of their
   expressive power and simplicity. Moreover due to the clear and concise
   notation of scenarios, they can be used to analyze the system
   requirements for general validity, lack of deadlock, and existence of
   emergent behavior. In this paper a methodology to analyze the
   scalability of social networks is presented. This methodology is devised
   to indicate whether or not the new requirements of the system are
   consistent with the current requirements in place. A larger prototype of
   a social network of MSA for semantic search is utilized to illustrate
   the developed methodology.}},

Abstract = {{The verification of Multiagent Systems (MAS) and Distributed Software
   Systems (DSS) has taken a special attention due to the growing demand of
   having DSS in recent years. The distributed functionality and lack of
   having a central control in MAS and DSS may cause to emerge new
   behaviors in the execution time. This unexpected behavior which was not
   seen in the requirements is known as emergent behavior and may cause
   irreparable damages. Detection of these emergent behaviors is more
   valuable and cost effective in the early phases compared to detecting
   them after the deployment. In this paper we propose a new technique for
   the detection of a specific type of emergent behavior in the design
   phase. We take the advantage of social network visualization in this
   method. The novelty and direct advantage of this technique is presenting
   the exact point and cause of emergent behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Microscopic examination of a properly prepared blood smear is valuable
   in complete blood count (CBC) and differential blood count (DBC). A
   hematopathologist may spend enormous time manually inspecting the good
   working area (GWA) of the blood smear under a light microscope system to
   perform CBC or DBC. In this paper we focus on automatic localization of
   the GWA by classifying microscopic images of blood smears using
   different machine learning algorithms into three areas: Clumped, Good,
   and Sparse. The features used are the statistical and texture features.
   This approach yields a good localization of GWA in images acquired by a
   low cost light microscope system, scanned under magnifying power of x100
   oil-immersed objective. Our experiment using images with resolution
   (3488x2616 pixels) of Giemsa-stained blood smears shows that the
   proposed method has an accuracy of 82\% for the localizing the GWA and
   79.73\% for all areas in a validation set of 301images}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in power line communications (PLC) have made it popular
   for in-home networking. This makes PLC an increasingly relevant source
   of interference for digital subscriber line (DSL) networks within the
   home environment. This paper presents measured PLC-to-DSL coupling
   channels for a worst case DSL deployment scenario. We then propose an
   interference cancelling scheme based on a frequency domain interference
   canceller (FDIC) that utilizes the common mode (CM) PLC interference to
   estimate and remove the differential mode (DM) PLC interference. The
   mean square error (MSE) of the proposed FDIC is derived and compared to
   the minimum MSE achieved by an optimum Wiener filter. Improvement in the
   signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) achieved by using the
   FDIC is also presented. Both mathematical analysis and simulation
   results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FCID in reducing
   the DM PLC interference on the DM DSL signal.}},

Abstract = {{The computation of relaxation time from quantitative magnetic resonance

   The T2 images of a healthy male volunteer's right knee tibiofemoral
   joint cartilage were generated by a 3T MR imaging scanner using a spin
   echo multislice multiecho (MSME) Carr-Purcell Meiboom-Gill (CPMG)
   sequence. The medial and lateral condyle cartilage regions were further
   subdivided into three compartments - anterior, middle and posterior for
   identifying T2 values variation in between them. The T2 relaxation time
   mean and standard deviation in each region of interest (ROI) was
   calculated using the algebraic fitting algorithm and compared with
   conventional nonlinear algorithms. The results show that the algebraic
   fitting algorithm is feasible for T2 relaxation time calculation of knee

Abstract = {{In this paper, generic bandwidth-scalable behavioral models suitable for
   power amplifiers exhibiting memory effects are proposed. The models are
   built around state of the art two-box models, namely the Hammerstein
   model and the forward twin-nonlinear two-box model, and take advantage
   of the separation, in these two-box models, between the static and
   dynamic distortions of the power amplifier. In the proposed
   bandwidth-scalable two-box models, rather than updating the entire model
   coefficients when the signal bandwidth changes, the memoryless function
   is maintained unchanged and only the function modeling the dynamic
   distortions is updated. Experimental validation carried out on a Doherty
   amplifier prototype shows that the proposed bandwidth-scalable models
   are able to achieve the same performance as the conventional models
   while reducing the number of parameters to be updated following a change
   in the operating signal bandwidth by up to approximately 75\% for the
   Hammerstein model and 40\% for the forward twin-nonlinear two-box model.
   The developed models are suitable for emerging wireless applications
   where operating conditions varies rapidly.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a generalized twin-nonlinear two-box predistorter is
   proposed for the linearization of highly nonlinear Doherty power
   amplifiers exhibiting strong memory effects. The proposed predistorter
   is made of the cascade of a memoryless look-up table followed by a
   generalized memory polynomial function and thus can be seen as a two-box
   implementation of the generalized memory polynomial model. The
   generalized twin-nonlinear two-box predistorter is experimentally
   benchmarked against the generalized memory polynomial model. The
   linearization performances of both models when applied on a GaN based
   Doherty power amplifier driven by a 20MHz LTE signal, demonstrate the
   superiority of the proposed predistorter which achieves better linearity
   performance while requiring a lower number of coefficients. Indeed, an
   extra 5dB is obtained in the ACLR while the number of predistorter
   coefficients is reduced by more than 60\%.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the energy consumption within a soldier worn wireless
   body area network (WBAN) is minimized by formulating and solving two
   optimization problems. In the first optimization problem,
   Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions are used to analytically
   determine the effect of jointly optimizing transmission power, payload
   size, and retransmissions on energy consumption for transmission along a
   link within a WBAN, under a packet error rate (PER) constraint. In the
   second optimization problem, sensor nodes with different source rates
   and placements on the body are configured to use variable transmission
   power, payload size, and retransmission in order to minimize the total
   energy consumption in the WBAN under a PER constraint. This is a
   non-linear non-convex problem that is converted into an easily solvable
   convex optimization problem using generalized geometric programming. The
   numerical results show that using the joint optimization approach for
   the transmission configuration parameters can increase the WBAN network
   lifetime by two folds when compared against a configuration that only
   optimizes transmission power and retransmissions.}},

Abstract = {{A novel design method of concurrent dual-band power amplifiers (PAs)
   including impedance tuning at inter-band modulation (IM) frequencies is
   proposed in this paper. It's shown that the impedances exhibited to the
   transistor at IM frequencies can affect the performance of a concurrent
   PA significantly. Thus it is very essential to take IM impedances into
   account, which can be referred to as IM impedance manipulation, or IM
   tuning for short. An example concurrent dual-band 1.9-2.6GHz PA is
   designed using the proposed method and a conventional concurrent
   dual-band PA not considering IM tuning is also designed for the purpose
   of comparison. Designed with a 10-Watts GaN HEMT, the proposed PA
   exhibits about 11 Watts output power and higher than 72.8\% drain
   efficiency when driven equally by concurrent CW stimulus. To our best
   knowledge, this is the state-of-the-art performance of concurrent
   dual-band PA, and it's the first reported concurrent PA with IM tuning.}},

   rewritten as a new form with each of the polynomial terms normalized for

   taken to prune the terms of the model. Two experiments on different PAs
   were taken to verify the method. Both of them prove the proposed method
   works effectively to prune the terms of 2-D-DPD model without losing
   modeling precision. The numbers of coefficients in the model were
   reduced from 24 to 9 and from 30 to 13 while only about 1dB adjacent

Abstract = {{Echo state networks (ESNs), that exhibit good performance for modeling a
   nonlinear or non-Gaussian dynamic system, have been widely used for time
   series prediction. However, estimating the output weights of the ESNs
   remains intractable. Extended Kalman filter (EKF) is an effective
   estimate method, but its computational cost is relatively high. In this
   study, a MapReduce framework based parallelized EKF is proposed to learn
   the parameters of the network, in which two MapReduce based models are
   designed, and each of them is composed of a set of mapper and reducer
   functions. The mapper receives a training sample and generates the
   updates of the internal states or the output weights, while the reducer
   merges all updates associated with the same key to produce an average
   value. To verify the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed
   method, an industrial data prediction problem coming from the blast
   furnace gas (BFG) system in steel industry is employed for the
   validation experiments, and the experimental results demonstrate that
   the proposed parallelized EKF can efficiently estimate the parameters of
   the ESN with good performance and computing time.}},

   However, for a joining process to be truly effective in the fabrication

   without compromising the mechanical properties of the metals being
   joined. In this paper the diffusion bonding process is discussed as a
   method for joining complex metals and examples are given and include
   aluminium metal matrix composites and light alloys such as Ti-6Al-4V and
   a magnesium alloy (AZ31). The paper highlights the importance of the

   it is a well-recognized template which models all activities within the

   construction job-sites. This paper explains how Earth-Sim was developed
   solely using the common elements found in SimFC without any programming.

Abstract = {{The popularity of a neighbourhood is often explained by its perceived
   ``higher{''} quality of life. Good access to shops, restaurants, parks,
   etc., is seen as an indicator that reflects improved quality of life. We
   present a web-based tool for assessment of accessibility to such
   services. The system evaluates in real time an area that is accessible
   using pedestrian, transit, and cycling infrastructure. The accessible
   area is evaluated using ``quality of life{''} indicators, such as the
   number of grocery stores, shopping and recreation facilities, and local
   crime within that area. This tool sets itself apart from pre-computed
   and neighbourhood-level walkability indices, because it makes use of
   detailed street-level data, rather than block-level generalizations. It
   uses real network travel time, and, when transit data are provided,
   permits the creation and evaluation of accessibility areas for a
   combination of travel modes such as walking with transit use.}},

Abstract = {{It is recognized that the generic form of machine learning is a
   knowledge acquisition and manipulation process mimicking the brain.
   Therefore, knowledge representation as a dynamic concept network is
   centric in the design and implementation of the intelligent knowledge

   Knowledge Representation System (FKRS) for autonomous concept formation
   and manipulation based on concept algebra. The Object-Attribute-Relation
   (OAR) model for knowledge representation is adopted in the design of
   FKRS. The conceptual model, architectural model, and behavioral models
   of the FKRS system is formally designed and specified in Real-Time
   Process Algebra (RTPA). The FKRS system is implemented in Java as a core
   component towards the development of the CLE and other knowledge-based
   systems in cognitive computing and computational intelligence.}},

Title = {{Empirical Studies on the Functional Complexity of Software in
   Large-Scale Software Systems}},
Booktitle = {{ADVANCES IN ABSTRACT INTELLIGENCE AND SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Pages = {{174-192}},
Abstract = {{Functional complexity is one of the most fundamental properties of
   software because almost all other software attributes and properties
   such as functional size, development effort, costs, quality, and project
   duration are highly dependent on it. The functional complexity of
   software is a macro-scope problem concerning the semantic properties of
   software and human cognitive complexity towards a given software system;
   while the computational complexity is a micro-scope problem concerning
   algorithmic analyses towards machine throughput and time/space
   efficiency. This paper presents an empirical study on the functional
   complexity of software known as cognitive complexity based on
   large-scale samples using a Software Cognitive Complexity Analysis Tool
   (SCCAT). Empirical data are obtained with SCCAT on 7,531 programs and
   five formally specified software systems. The theoretical foundation of
   software functional complexity is introduced and the metric of software
   cognitive complexity is formally modeled. The functional complexities of
   a large-scale software system and the air traffic control systems (ATCS)
   are rigorously analyzed. A novel approach to represent software
   functional complexities and their distributions in software systems is
   developed. The nature of functional complexity of software in software
   engineering is rigorously explained. The relationship between the
   symbolic and functional complexities of software is quantitatively
   analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{There are several geotechnical problems for which the formulation of
   large deformations is vital for their solution. Among these problems are
   in-situ penetration tests. In this paper, a new numerical approach is
   used to solve such problems efficiently with the aim to calibrate
   fundamental soil properties to fit the global penetration resistance
   obtained from experimental studies. The utilized numerical method treats
   the continuum as rigid plastic with a non-uniform strength field, where
   the spatial distribution of strength is determined by converting time
   changes into spatial distributions using the governing equation of
   steady state (low. For this purpose, the method employs an upstream
   weighting technique for determination of information flow within the
   domain. Using the suggested method, the resistance factors for in-situ
   T-bar and ball penetrometers were obtained under a various soil
   conditions. These included the rate effect on the soil, strain softening
   and anisotropy, all of which affect the shear strength of the soil.
   General expressions for the resistance factors of the T-bar and ball
   penetrometers are finally suggested for engineering use.}},

Title = {{Photogrammetric Bundle Adjustment With Self-Calibration of the
   PrimeSense 3D Camera Technology: Microsoft Kinect}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{1}},
Pages = {{465-474}},
Abstract = {{The Kinect system is arguably the most popular 3-D camera technology
   currently on the market. Its application domain is vast and has been
   deployed in scenarios where accurate geometric measurements are needed.
   Regarding the PrimeSense technology, a limited amount of work has been
   devoted to calibrating the Kinect, especially the depth data. The Kinect
   is, however, inevitably prone to distortions, as independently confirmed
   by numerous users. An effective method for improving the quality of the
   Kinect system is by modeling the sensor's systematic errors using bundle
   adjustment. In this paper, a method for modeling the intrinsic and
   extrinsic parameters of the infrared and colour cameras, and more
   importantly the distortions in the depth image, is presented. Through an
   integrated marker- and feature-based self-calibration, two Kinects were
   calibrated. A novel approach for modeling the depth systematic errors as
   a function of lens distortion and relative orientation parameters is
   shown to be effective. The results show improvements in geometric
   accuracy up to 53\% compared with uncalibrated point clouds captured
   using the popular software RGBDemo. Systematic depth discontinuities
   were also reduced and in the check-plane analysis the noise of the
   Kinect point cloud was reduced by 17\%.}},

Abstract = {{A major barrier to the acceptance of small wind turbines is that they
   are perceived to be noisy particularly when mounted on monopole towers
   rather than traditional guy-wired ones. This paper discusses an aspect
   of noise propagation that has not been studied previously: vibration of
   the tower. To start studying the tower's behavior, twenty four
   accelerometers were attached in two orthogonal lines along the 10 m
   tower of Southwest Windpower Skystream 2.4 kW wind turbine located at
   the edge of the city of Calgary. About 15 minutes of data were recorded
   in order to extract natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes
   while the turbine was in operating. Operational modal analysis (OMA), in
   which input loads are considered the ambient input, is conducted to
   identify dominant modes up to 100 Hz. This range covers the infrasound
   region (<20 Hz) that might be perceived at sufficiently high sound
   pressure levels. The captured modal frequencies and modal shapes
   compared favorably to those predicted by a finite element analysis.
   Results indicate that a cluster of modes located around 10 Hz show
   significantly higher magnitude than other modes. This corresponds to the
   second bending mode. Short-time Fourier transform was used to
   distinguish natural and forced frequencies. It was seen. that higher
   modes were exited less than lower ones. Original signals were decomposed
   using discrete wavelet transform to obtain different frequency bands.
   Relative root mean square values for each frequency band were calculated
   to determine the contribution to the vibration energy. It was observed
   that most of vibration energy occurs in the lowest frequency band which
   is in the infrasound region. The accelerometers were monitored while the
   blades and generator accelerated and decelerated as the wind speed
   changed, and only the first bending mode was excited significantly which
   apparently generates most of noise emission.}},

Abstract = {{In weak GNSS signal environments, extending integration time is
   paramount to improving the GNSS receiver's sensitivity. Furthermore,
   sufficient coherent integration can help to mitigate multipath and
   cross-correlation false locks, and avoid squaring loss. In GNSS data
   channels, extending integration time requires the navigation message
   data bit wipe-off. The Maximum-Likelihood (ML) estimation method has
   been shown as the most effective way to estimate the navigation bit
   boundary locations (i.e., bit synchronization) and subsequently estimate
   the data bit values (i.e., bit decoding) in the presence of noise alone.
   However, the tracking threshold in conventional scalar-based GNSS
   receivers limits the performance of ML bit synchronization and decoding.
   In this paper, the benefits are analyzed and determined of using vector
   tracking in standalone mode to improve bit synchronization and decoding.
   In the context of GPS L1 C/A signals, results show that ML bit
   synchronization and bit decoding are valid for signals as low as 15
   dB-Hz in vector tracking. The simulator test results show vector
   tracking can extend the validity of ML bit synchronization and decoding
   by 13 dB over scalar tracking. The field test results show that vector
   tracking can improve the successful decoding rate (SDR) by 3\% - 35\%
   depending on the signal strength. The navigation results show that
   extended coherent integration can help to improve the navigation
   performance in signal challenged environments. The position and velocity
   accuracy has been improved about 50\% after extending coherent
   integration time from 20 ms to 100 ms in the vehicular navigation test.
   Two newly proposed strategies have helped to overcome the high bit error
   rate (BER) problem using ML bit decoding for bit wipe-off.}},

Abstract = {{The increased in number of ranging signals from new GNSS constellations
   is expected to result in better system availability especially to users

   This paper investigates the system availability and reliability
   performance of current GPS-GLONASS constellation with additional
   satellites from Medium Earth Orbit BeiDou and Galileo. The performance
   of GPS-GLONASS with complete and partial Galileo and BeiDou are

Abstract = {{Position errors for a GPS standalone solution can exceed 200 meters in
   indoor environments due to limited satellite availability, weak signals
   and multipath. Therefore hybrid positioning methods have been developed
   integrating other signals and sensors including pseudolites,
   ultra-wideband, cell ID and WLAN fingerprinting with GPS to aid
   navigation in indoor environments. Service providers using such hybrid
   solutions claim location accuracies on the order of 10 meters in open
   sky and 50 meters indoors. This paper presents test results obtained by
   integrating software based 2.4 GHz WLAN Time-of-Arrival measurements
   with GPS. Reference trajectories were obtained using conventional
   surveying, where the kinematic trajectory was formed by moving between
   pre-surveyed points. Tests were conducted in a high multipath indoor
   environment with limited satellite availability but with ranging from
   multiple WLAN access points to the mobile user. Results show that ranges
   from several overlapping WLAN nodes combined with GPS pseudorange
   measurements can provide five meter or better position accuracy in these

Abstract = {{Modern mobile phones are powerful devices that are equipped with an
   array of technologies of interest to the world of pedestrian navigation.
   On-board inertial sensors allow phones to be used for navigation in
   areas with limited or no GPS signal availability. An inherent problem
   with inertial navigation in the absence of GPS signals, i.e., in indoor
   environments, is that the low-cost MEMS sensors used in calculating
   users position suffer from errors which accumulate over time. These
   accumulated errors result in a drift of the navigation solution with
   respect to time even with appropriate error modeling.
   Though this drift exists in all scenarios where MEMS sensors are used
   for navigation, it makes the navigation solution completely useless for
   long periods of indoor navigation without external updates. Another
   problem associated with smartphone-based navigation is due to the fact
   that a user does not keep a phone precisely fixed in a specific
   orientation. As a user moves around their environment and interacts with
   the device, the device orientation and user orientation are free to
   change with respect to one another. Common examples of changing device
   orientation include those when texting, on ear, in pocket, on a belt,
   etc. The estimation of the device heading and the user heading
   especially when the device heading is changing with respect to the
   user's heading is a challenging task and the effects of any errors here
   can significantly reduce the accuracy of the navigation solution.
   Nowadays nearly all phones are equipped with cameras, some being forward
   facing, some rear facing, and many possessing both. To date, nobody has
   used the vision sensors to estimate the misalignment of the smartphone
   with respect to the user. This paper presents a technique of estimating
   the heading and the heading misalignment between the device and person
   using a sequence of images. This work is patent pending.}},

Abstract = {{Stereo vision has recently attracted increased interest for the purpose
   of navigation, especially in areas where other means of navigation are
   either not available or not feasible.
   This paper discusses models used for systematic error correction,
   methods for feature tracking and ego-motion estimation and a model for
   integrating the vision system ego-motion estimation with GNSS
   measurements. A lens distortion correction method using an existing
   algorithm and manually selected features of opportunity only is used,
   and the details of an algorithm for stereo camera calibration using a
   least-squares estimator and manually selected features of opportunity
   are presented. The details of a least-squares based ego-motion and
   accuracy estimator are provided and supported by a covariance analysis
   of different feature point distributions. Although the results don't
   include the output of the system combination Kalman filter, its model is
   presented.
   The results include dead-reckoning performance of two different vision
   system setups with low-cost webcams and high-quality GPS-synchronized
   cameras, compared to the output of two GNSS receivers as well as a
   reference trajectory. Ego-motion estimations extracted from more than
   1400 images with a total travelled distance of more than 500 m were
   computed and are shown in the results.}},

Abstract = {{Smartphones not only provide communication and entertainment to the
   users but they are important sources to acquire positioning information.
   A coarse positioning solution can be obtained using the cell phone
   towers `seen' by the phone when the phone is turned on and sometimes
   this coarse navigation solution can be the only solution. In addition,
   smartphones come equipped with Assisted Global Positioning System (AGPS)
   chipset to provide absolute and accurate positioning solution. AGPS
   positioning requires locking to at least four satellites which is
   impossible in deep indoor environments despite specialized techniques to
   acquire weak satellite signals. Smartphones also have capabilities to
   receive WiFi signals and the positions based on these signals. These
   positions are provided for public places by different service providers
   and the accuracy of such positions can be better than 50m in deep indoor
   environments. Also available on the smartphones are accelerometers,
   gyros, magnetometers and barometer sensors. Trusted Positioning uses
   these sensors to provide a complete navigation solution. This solution
   is capable of taking any absolute positioning updates to ensure the most
   accurate navigation for the user. When the absolute updates from cell
   tower, AGPS or WiFi become available to the Trusted Portable Navigator
   (T-PN) engine, they can be delayed when compared to the motion
   measurements made by the onboard sensors. It is important to take care
   of the delay of these measurements before using them as updates. If a
   delayed signal is used without proper mitigation, the overall solution
   will look as if it is pulled backwards for straight line sections of the
   trajectory. If a delayed measurement is applied during a turn, the
   heading can show an error of up to 180 degrees which can cause
   instability in the solution or completely wrong heading of the overall
   solution. This paper will provide methods to estimate the delays using
   offline processing methods and the algorithm for mitigation of the
   delays during real time processing.}},

Abstract = {{Simultaneous use of two or more GNSS systems may be categorized at three
   different levels: 1) Compatible, 2) Interoperable and 3)
   Interchangeable, as for instance described in Pullen (2007) and
   discussed by Parkinson (2007). Compatible is when two or more GNSS can
   be used independently or together without interfering with each other.
   Interoperable is when the combination of two or more GNSS systems
   enhances the performance for some applications. For example, GPS-GLONASS
   applications can generally be considered both compatible and
   interoperable. Interchangeable is the highest level of integration where
   data from different GNSS constellations are used together in one
   solution without loss of accuracy or redundancy. The Fugro real-time
   GPS-GLONASS PPP (Precise Point Positioning) solution (Melgard et al
   2009) is very close to being an interchangeable integration (Melgard et
   al 2011). Full interchangeable integration between GPS and Galileo is
   easier to achieve since Galileo uses CDMA (Code Division Multiple
   Access) coding like GPS does, and shares two common frequencies with GPS
   at L1/E1 and L5/E5a as shown in Figure 1.
   {[}GRAPHICS]
   When introducing Galileo in PPP solutions, the interchangeable mode is
   advantageous because of the limited number of Galileo satellites
   available during early stages of system deployment. And, in addition, it
   will always improve performance in signal blocking situations. When only
   a few satellites are in view, typically a mix of GPS and Galileo
   satellites will be received. The use of the interchangeable mode in such
   situations will save one satellite, so that only four satellites are
   needed to calculate a position. Hence, the interchangeable mode will
   increase availability, reliability and accuracy of position solutions.
   In the case of GLONASS PPP, it was found that the GPS/GLONASS clock
   offset changes over time (Melgard et al 2011). Therefore a procedure to
   continuously estimate the offset is implemented in user software. In the
   case of mixing Galileo and GPS measurements, there are strong
   indications that the GPS/Galileo clock offset experienced at the user
   end will remain constant if correctly handled. Odijk \& Teunissen (2012)
   show that GPS/Galileo Inter System Bias (ISB) values are very stable
   over time. Also recent findings by Paziewski et al (2013) show very
   stable GPS/Galileo ISBs.
   While the work of Odijk \& Teunissen (2012) and Paziewski et al (2013)
   are oriented towards baseline processing, i.e. RTK, this paper focuses
   on PPP applications. The results include calibration of ISB values for
   different receiver brands, calculating precise orbits and clocks for
   combined GNSS constellations, correctly handling the biases and showing
   position results for mixed GPS and Galileo constellations in
   interchangeable mode.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term ephemeris extension is needed in challenging environments in
   order to reduce the Time-To-First-Fixed (TTFF). It makes quick position
   fix possible for mobile devices while they are still acquiring the
   broadcast ephemeris. Based on the experiment results described in this
   paper, the median User Range Error (URE) for the extended ephemeris
   after one week and four weeks is 5.68m and 88.98m, respectively.
   Simulated signal obstruction experiments are also conducted to assess
   the position fix accuracy, availability and reliability based on
   different mean square positional error (MSPE) thresholds, prediction
   durations and obstruction scenarios. The results have shown 95.57\%
   navigation availability at 99.28\% reliability with one obstruction and
   83.37\% navigation availability at 97.12\% reliability with two
   obstructions based on a user-defined MSPE of 50m after one week

Abstract = {{During ionospheric storms, the electron density in the ionosphere is
   significantly affected, generating small and large scale gradients in
   the ionosphere, and also resulting in small scale structure, in
   particular ionospheric irregularities which cause rapid random
   fluctuation in phase and/or amplitude of a received GNSS signal. The
   level of fluctuation can be quantified by phase and amplitude
   scintillation indices which are the standard deviation of the phase and
   normalized standard deviation of the intensity respectively. Fast phase
   changes and/or deep amplitude fades can present a considerable problem
   to the carrier tracking loop of a GPS receiver's PLL (Phase Lock Loop)
   which can result in phase deviations, cycle slips or sometime even a
   complete loss of lock of the PLL for one or more of the visible
   satellites leading to a significant positional error. The strength of
   scintillation generated due to ionospheric irregularities has been
   extensively studied using the time derivative of TEC (Total Electron
   Content) and this has been correlated with ionospheric scintillation. In
   a recent study (Tiwari et al. 2013), an analogous phase scintillation
   index was presented which using a high pass filtered RoT at 1 Hz rate.
   This showed a good correlation with the standard phase scintillation
   index for signals received during strong geomagnetic storms in the high
   latitude region. Calculations of the standard deviation of phase jitter
   of the PLL using Conker et al.' s formula also showed good correlation
   between results derived using the analogous and standard phase
   scintillation indices.
   In this study, the phase jitter of the carrier tracking loop of a GPS
   receiver is investigated under different conditions including PLL loop
   order, bandwidth and carrier frequency and found to be well correlated
   with the estimated phase jitter using TEC data collected at 1 Hz. To
   validate this approach, experiments were conducted at the Newcastle
   University laboratory using a NovAtel 4004B GPS receiver for collecting
   TEC at a 1 Hz data rate and our own developed GPS software receiver
   coupled to both a USRP (Universal Software Radio Peripheral) N210, and
   at Trondheim with a GISTM receiver where an analytic approach is used
   for the estimation of the PLL jitter variance. In both case, the TEC
   derived phase error is correlated with the PLL jitter variance.}},

Abstract = {{It is recognized that multipath remains as a dominant source of ranging
   error in CDMA and Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)
   positioning. Given the limitations of the traditional multipath code
   delay estimation techniques, this work considers another class of code
   tracking algorithm wherein the GNSS receive endeavors to characterize
   the propagation channel by estimating the relative delay of LOS signal
   and each individual reflection. Within this class there are two kinds of
   algorithm, those which require a-priori knowledge of the channel, and
   those which do not. Without a-priori information, the receiver must
   perform a full multipath estimation procedure, a process which can be
   computationally expensive. When provided with an initial estimate of the
   multipath channel, however, the receiver need only incur a small
   computational overhead to track changes in the channel. In this work,
   both of these cases are considered and a receiver design is proposed
   which adaptively alternates between full channel characterization and
   recursive channel refinement, depending on the severity of the
   variations of the channel to provide a robust and efficient multipath
   mitigating GNSS receiver.
   The performance of the proposed scheme has been developed and tested
   using several simulations and real-life data processing results. In all
   of the real data tests, the computed range and position solutions by the
   proposed techniques will be compared to the reference trajectory
   achieved by a high precision Inertial Measurement Unit.}},

Abstract = {{High sensitivity GNSS receivers have proven to be of great potential in
   vast applications, such as location based services, vehicular and
   pedestrian purposes. When it comes to challenged environments, the
   signal tracking and navigation solution may encounter many difficulties
   and get degraded results. Vector tracking receivers that take advantages
   of mutual information among satellites are usually used, and sometimes
   can improve performance. However, it generally requires other
   operations, such as filtering along time, smoothing by using Doppler or
   even extending coherent integration using data bit wipe-off. In certain
   scenarios, multipath and cross correlation may still significantly
   affect the performance, and it is difficult to assess whether or not the
   bottleneck is due to signal tracking and/or navigation solution.
   This paper focuses on evaluating the performance of code phase tracking
   in some challenged environments. No extended coherent integration, no
   filtering or smoothing is applied. Navigation domain multipath
   mitigation methods that use maximum likelihood vector tracking
   architecture and maximum likelihood navigation solution are introduced.
   Both foliage and downtown data show more robust code phase tracking and
   more reliable positioning can be achieved by using the algorithm
   proposed herein.}},

Abstract = {{Ionospheric scintillations can degrade the performance of GNSS receivers
   by causing random and rapid variations in the phase and amplitude of
   trans-ionospheric signals. This is of concern in equatorial regions
   where strong scintillation events can be observed during the active
   equatorial scintillation months (October and March). In this study, we
   present a new analysis of receiver design considerations for equatorial
   scintillation. For this study a low-latitude data set is collected by
   the IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) in Rio de
   Janeiro using a University of Calgary Leapfrog front-end. IF samples
   from scintillation events are post-processed using the GSNRx (TM)
   software receiver developed at University of Calgary.
   The software receiver has the capability of processing L1C/A and L2C
   signals.. Scintillation levels are quantified by amplitude and phase
   scintillation parameters estimated from the correlators' in-phase (I)
   and quadraphase (Q) components and carrier phase information all derived
   by the software receiver. Characteristics such as scintillation
   correlation effects between L1C/A and L2C observations are quantified
   for the equatorial ionosphere. One option to improve the performance of
   GNSS receivers in acquiring and tracking L2C signal is to assist using
   L1 signal information. This method is investigated in this work and
   results show a significant improvement in the performance of software
   receiver over the so-called ``independent{''} tracking of each signal.
   Optimal receiver design parameters for different frequencies are
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), which can provide accurate
   PVT (position, velocity, time) information all over the world, has been
   an important resource of supporting a wide range of civil scientific,
   commercial activity and military communication. As the electro-magnetic
   environment becoming increasingly complex, though, Global Navigation
   Satellite System has certain capability of immunity from interference
   since Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) is utilized, the low-power
   received signal is susceptible to intentional or unintentional
   interferences. Therefore, to ensure its performance, the suppression
   technique is needed to increase the interference immunity of the GNSS
   receiver.
   This paper describes transform domain interference suppression in GNSS
   receiver based on FrFT with adaptive threshold in allusion to the
   suppression of common interference signals: the narrow-band, multi-tone
   interference and the chirp interference. This method, in detecting and
   localizing the type of interference reserved by pattern recognition
   module reserves, accomplished the excision process at corresponding
   fractional order where the energy spectrum have best focused effect in
   the interference suppression module. The result that well interference
   suppressing capability of multiple interferences and chirp interference
   was rendered in this method. In addition, the adaptive threshold
   algorithm can make a flexible trade-off between suppression effect and
   resource consumption in a certain extent.}},

Abstract = {{GNSS range measurements suffer from a variety of systematic biases and
   errors. Most of these errors can be eliminated or reduced by
   differential positioning techniques as they are temporally or spatially
   correlated between the remote and base station receivers. The use of
   Satellite Based Augmentation System (SBAS) is also proven to improve
   positioning performance by reducing these errors in standalone receivers
   (Misra \& Enge 2011). The measurement bias caused by signal multipath
   behaves differently because unlike other errors, multipath is normally
   uncorrelated between antenna locations. Hence, the base and remote
   receivers experience different multipath and as a result differencing
   between them will not cancel the errors. As such, multipath remains a
   major source of error in range measurements in both single point and
   differential positioning modes, especially in indoor and degraded signal
   environments.
   The existing multipath mitigation techniques attempt to eliminate
   multipath effects on pseudorange measurement accuracy by tracking the
   peak of the correlation triangle in Global Positioning System (GPS)
   receivers. Most of these techniques are based on the assumption that the
   Line-of-Sight (LOS) signal is stronger than the Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS)
   signals. However, in the scenarios where the LOS signal is weaker than
   the composite multipath signal, this approach may result in a bias in
   code tracking. In this paper, the distortions in the GPS receiver
   correlation peak due to multipath are investigated to understand the
   effects on code tracking performance. A novel method is proposed to
   separate LOS and multipath signals under such conditions for static and
   low dynamic receivers.}},

   reliable estimates of the relative errors in the least-squares
   adjustment (via re-scaling of data variance-covariance matrices) and to
   ensure that the vertical motion model is not distorted by erroneous
   data. The combined vertical motion model shows a subsidence of 1-2
   mm/year along the southern shores and an uplift of 3-4 mm/year along the
   northern shores generally consistent with the models of postglacial

Abstract = {{A study on dechlorination of PCB138 in transformer oil (TO) and
   2-propanol (IPA) using 254 nm ultraviolet (UV) light as well as dye
   sensitized visible light has been conducted. Studies on dechlorination
   of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in TO using visible light in the
   presence of methylene blue (MB) and triethylamine (TEA) (providing a
   `photocatalytic' cycle) in both deaerated and aerated conditions have
   been conducted to determine effects of TO, MB and TEA on reaction rates.
   The results show that photolytic methods are effective in treating PCBs
   in TO, and that the oil plays a limited adverse role. Under UV
   irradiation, PCB 138 can be >99\% dechlorinated in the presence 0.06\%
   (w/w) TO in IPA within 1 h with a rate constant of 0.0853 min(-1), while
   47\% of PCB138 can be dechlorinated in 92.1\% (w/w) TO in IPA within 2 h
   with a rate constant of 0.0051 min(-1). In the `photocatalytic' system,
   94\% reduction of PCB 138 was achieved within 30 min with a rate
   constant of 0.0968 min(-1) when the solvent was 60.70\% (w/w) TO in IPA,
   while 71\% dechlorination of PCB138 was achieved within 30 min with a
   rate constant of 0.0382 min(-1) when 81.62\% (w/w) TO was present. In
   treatment of 30-73 ppm PCBs in TO, the optimal concentration of MB and
   TEA were found to be 0.5 g/L and 58.08 g/L respectively. Because of
   quenching by oxygen, deaeration of the solution is necessary for an
   efficient reaction. The photocatalytic system is especially adapted for
   treating lower concentration of PCBs in TO.}},

Abstract = {{Linear viscoelastic structures are characterized by dissipative forces
   that depend on the history of the velocity response via hereditary
   damping functions. The free motion equation leads to a nonlinear
   eigenvalue problem characterized by a frequency-dependent damping
   matrix. In the present paper, a novel and efficient numerical method for
   the computation of the eigenvalues of linear and proportional or lightly
   non-proportional viscoelastic structures is developed. The central idea
   is the construction of two complex-valued functions of a complex
   variable, whose fixed points are precisely the eigenvalues. This
   important property allows the use of these functions in a fixed-point
   iterative scheme. With help of some results in fixed point theory,
   necessary conditions for global and local convergence are provided. It
   is demonstrated that the speed of convergence is linear and directly
   depends on the level of induced damping. In addition, under certain
   conditions the recursive method can also be used for the calculation of
   non-viscous real eigenvalues. In order to validate the mathematical
   results, two numerical examples are analyzed, one for single
   degree-of-freedom systems and another for multiple ones. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{A novel solar-driven adsorption cooling system that is able to produce
   cold continuously along the 24-h of the day is proposed in this study.
   The working principle of the proposed system is based on the constant
   temperature adsorption cooling cycle which is introduced also in this
   work. Both of the cooling system principle of operation and the cycle
   description are explained in details. Moreover, complete thermodynamic
   analysis is performed for all components of the system as well as
   processes of the theoretical cycle. Activated carbon-methanol is used as
   the working pair in the case studied. Furthermore, a parametric study of
   the influence of many system parameters on the performance is
   accomplished and discussed as well. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In most studies related to product positioning, probabilistic consumer
   choice rules assume that a product always gains some market share no
   matter how small a product's utility value is or even if the utility
   value is negative. Some researchers have considered this problem in
   multidimensional-scaling-based model or share-of-surplus choice rule. In
   this study, we consider this problem for multinomial logit rule by
   introducing a piecewise function and establishing a
   conjoint-analysis-based one-step optimization model for product
   positioning. Interval analysis is applied to obtain the optimal price of
   the new product from the model, and the mathematical properties of the
   profit-maximizing model are analyzed. An interval-analysis-embedded Tabu
   Search (TS) algorithm is developed for solving the model. An industrial
   application employing the proposed model and the interval-analysis-based
   enumeration method is presented and sensitivity analysis is performed.
   An experiment for randomly created large-scale product positioning
   problems is carried out to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed TS

Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{228-239}},

Abstract = {{A new process based on aqueous-phase dehydration/hydrogenation (APD/H)
   has been developed to directly produce liquid alkanes (C7-9), which are
   the main components of fossil gasoline, from cellulose in one single
   batch reactor without the consumption of external hydrogen (H-2). In
   this new process, part of the cellulose is first converted to in situ
   H-2 by steam reforming (SR) in the steam gas phase mainly; and, in the
   liquid water phase, cellulose is converted to an alkane precursor, such
   as 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMP). In the final reaction step, in situ
   H-2 reacts with HMF to form liquid alkanes through APD/H. Accordingly,
   this new process has been named SR(H-2)-APD/H. Experimental results show
   that the volumetric ratio of the reactor headspace to the reactor (H/R)
   and an initial weakly alkaline condition are the two key parameters for
   SR(H-2)-APD/H. With proper H/R ratios (e.g., 0.84) and initial weakly
   alkaline conditions (e.g., pH = 7.5), liquid alkanes are directly formed
   from the SR(H-2)-APD/H of cellulose using in situ H-2 instead of
   external H-2. In this study, compared with pyrolysis and hydrothermal
   liquefaction of cellulose at the same temperatures with same retetion
   time, SR(H-2)-APD/H greatly increased the liquid alkane yields, by
   approximately 700 times and 35 times, respectively. Based on this
   process, direct formation of fossil gasoline from renewable biomass
   resources without using external H-2 becomes possible. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Snow water equivalent (SWE) and snow depth are some of the most
   important quantities in describing the properties of the accumulated
   snow during winter, which is a source of runoff during spring season.
   Here, our objective was to reconstruct the spatial dynamics of SWE and
   snow depth over a study area in eastern parts of the northern Alberta
   during the period 2007-09. The employed methods consisted of: (i)
   delineating snow presence from Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived normalized difference snow index
   (NDSI)-images, (ii) calculating heating degree days (HDD) from
   MODIS-based surface temperature images, (iii) modelling net solar
   radiation, and (iv) integrating all of the above steps in the frame of a
   process based snow-melt model and SWE ground data as well. We used
   similar to 45\% of the ground data (i.e., similar to 19 data points) in
   calibrating the values of base temperature and heating degree day
   coefficient for the model. Then the remaining similar to 55\% of the
   ground data (i.e., 23 data points) were used in validation. It revealed
   that the agreement between the model and measured SWE-values were
   reasonable (i.e., 59\%, 72\%, and 62\% of the time values were within
   +/- 20\% deviations during 2007, 2008, and 2009 respectively). The root
   mean square deviation (RMSD) between the measured and modelled
   SWE-values were also reasonable and found to be +/- 24.75 mm in 2007,
   +/- 25.05 mm in 2008, and +/- 23.99 mm in 2009. Overall, the
   SWE-predictions at all of the measurement sites were on an average 7.5\%
   higher in 2007, 10.2\% lower in 2008, and 1.9\% lower in 2009 than that
   of ground-based measurements. During the period 2007-2009, we found that
   the study area-specific average values of SWE and its depth were 177 mm
   and 694 mm respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal stimulation of bitumen in oil-sands reservoirs is a critical
   requirement for the success of steam-based recovery processes such as
   steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). If the bitumen is not heated, it
   remains at its original viscosity, often in the millions of centipoise
   and, thus, is not mobilized so that it cannot be moved to a production
   well. All oil-sands reservoirs are heterogeneous, both with respect to
   geology and fluid composition, and, thus, conformance of steam in the
   reservoir is not uniform. At present, real-time monitoring of the
   steam-conformance zone in the reservoir is not possible, and, thus, the
   spatial distribution of heat delivery to the reservoir is uncertain. In
   this research, a new method for detecting heterogeneity and monitoring
   steam chambers has been developed and tested by detailed
   thermal/acoustic reservoir simulation. Here, a thermal fluid-flow
   simulator was one-way coupled to a wave-propagation simulator
   (information passed is density alone) to evaluate the potential of
   identifying rock and fluid discontinuities during a SAGD operation with
   coded white-noise-reflection processes. Digital communication systems
   use coded white-noise processes to make advantageous use of unexpected
   reflections from environmental heterogeneities. The proposed theory and
   subsequent simulations reveal that it is possible to resolve the edge of
   the SAGD steam chamber and to image the heterogeneity within the
   reservoir as it evolves with white-noise-reflection methods. The
   properties of the signals described provide an opportunity for property
   detection at lower power levels and higher frequencies than traditional
   seismic methods. Furthermore, the signals are such that the noise from
   recovery processes and the native reservoir environment do not interfere
   with the detection methods, allowing for the monitoring method to be
   used concurrently with the recovery process.}},

Abstract = {{The pore structure of unconventional gas reservoirs, despite having a
   significant impact on hydrocarbon storage and transport, has
   historically been difficult to characterize because of a wide pore-size
   distribution (PSD), with a significant pore volume (PV) in the nanopore
   range. A variety of methods is typically required to characterize the
   full pore spectrum, with each individual technique limited to a certain
   pore size range.
   In this work, we investigate the use of nondestructive, low-pressure
   adsorption methods, in particular low-pressure N-2 adsorption analysis,
   to infer pore shape and to determine PSDs of a tight gas siltstone
   reservoir in western Canada. Unlike previous studies, core-plug samples,
   not crushed samples, are used for isotherm analysis, allowing an
   undisturbed pore structure (i.e., uncrushed) to be analyzed.
   Furthermore, the core plugs used for isotherm analysis are subsamples
   (end pieces) of cores for which mercury-injection capillary pressure
   (MICP) and permeability measurements were previously performed, allowing
   a more direct comparison with these techniques. PSDs, determined from
   two isotherm interpretation methods {[}Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH)
   theory and density functional theory (DFT)], are in reasonable agreement
   with MICP data for the portion of the PSD sampled by both. The pore
   geometry is interpreted as slot-shaped, as inferred from isotherm
   hysteresis loop shape, the agreement between adsorption- and
   MICP-derived dominant pore sizes, scanning-electron-microscope (SEM)
   imaging, and the character of measured permeability stress dependence.
   Although correlations between inorganic composition and total organic
   carbon (TOC) and between dominant pore-throat size and permeability are
   weak, the sample with the lowest illite clay and TOC content has the
   largest dominant pore-throat size and highest permeability, as estimated
   from MICP. The presence of stress relief-induced microfractures,
   however, appears to affect laboratory-derived (pressure-decay and
   pulse-decay) estimates of permeability for some samples, even after
   application of confining pressure.
   On the basis of the premise of slot-shaped pore geometry, fractured rock
   models (matchstick and cube) were used to predict absolute permeability,
   by use of dominant pore-throat size from MICP/adsorption analysis and
   porosity measured under confining pressure. The predictions are
   reasonable, although permeability is mostly overpredicted for samples
   that are unaffected by stress-release fractures. The conceptual model
   used to justify the application of these models is slot pores at grain
   boundaries or between organic matter and framework grains.}},

Abstract = {{In cyclic steam stimulation (CSS), steam is injected above the fracture
   pressure into the oil-sands reservoir. In early cycles, the injected
   steam fractures the reservoir, creating a relatively thin dilated zone
   that allows rapid distribution of heat within the reservoir without
   excessive displacement of oil from the neighborhood of the wellbore.
   Numerical reservoir-simulation models of CSS that deal with the
   fracturing process have difficulty simultaneously capturing flowing
   bottomhole-pressure (BHP) behavior and steam injection rate. In this
   research, coupled reservoir-simulation (flow and heat transfer) and
   geomechanics models are investigated to model dynamic fracturing during
   the first cycle of CSS in an oil-sands reservoir. In Alberta, Canada, in
   terms of volumetric production rate, CSS is the largest thermal recovery
   technology for bitumen production, with production rates equal to
   approximately 1.3 million B/D in 2008. The average recovery factor from
   CSS is between 25 and 28\% at the economic end of the process. This
   implies that the majority of bitumen remains in the ground. Because the
   mobility of the bitumen depends strongly on temperature, the performance
   of CSS is intimately linked to steam conformance in the reservoir, which
   is largely established during steam fracturing of the reservoir in the
   early cycles of the process. Thus, a fundamental understanding of the
   flow and geomechanical aspects of early-cycle CSS is critical. A
   detailed thermal reservoir-simulation model, including dilation and
   dynamic fracturing, was developed, with the use of a commercially
   available thermal reservoir simulator, to understand their effects on
   BHP and injection rate. The results demonstrate that geomechanics must
   be included to accurately model CSS. The results also suggest that the
   reservoir dilates during steam injection as the result of increases in
   reservoir temperature, which lead to thermal dilation and higher pore
   pressure.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for iceberg
   detection has been increasing thanks to the greater availability and
   coverage of SAR data, particularly polarimetric data. Greater amounts of
   polarimetric information can increase detection performance, preventing
   false alarms and missed detections. However, quad-polarization
   (quad-pot) SAR systems have increased data rate and power usage
   requirements, causing quad-pot modes to have generally half the swath
   width of dual-polarization (dual-pot) modes. Compact polarimetry is a
   compromise that allows the approximation of quad-pot information
   (referred to as ``pseudo quad-pot{''}) using a dual-pot SAR. In this
   paper, using compact polarimetric data simulated from RADARSAT-2
   quad-pot imagery, we show how pseudo-quad-pot data can be used for
   iceberg detection using the likelihood ratio test method. We show that
   use of the pseudo-quad-pot HV intensity can augment the detection
   performance of a compact polarimetric SAR system. We also compare the
   performance of the various compact polarimetric configurations to
   linearly polarized dual-pot and quad-pot data.}},

Title = {{An Innovative Approach for Pore Pressure Prediction and Drilling
   Optimization in an Abnormally Subpressured Basin}},
Journal = {{SPE DRILLING \& COMPLETION}},

Volume = {{27}},

Pages = {{531-545}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Thus far, an indirect generalized method to predict pore pressure under
   subpressured conditions has not been reported in the literature. In this
   work, an innovative procedure is presented for estimation of pore
   pressure and optimization of wells drilled in the abnormally
   subpressured Deep Basin of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB).
   The procedure starts with detailed evaluation of five wells drilled in a
   township that covers the study area. Pore pressure was calculated from
   sonic logs and the modified D exponent by the use of Eaton's method
   (Eaton 1975), which proved to be the most effective approach for
   abnormally subpressured conditions over a variety of methods tested
   (Contreras et al. 2011). The optimization procedure was carried out by
   use of the apparent-rock-strength log (ARSL), which is an effective
   indicator of formation drillability and is very sensitive to the pore
   pressure. Next, optimization of individual sections in each well was
   carried out to determine the optimum types of bits and operational
   parameters for the lowest cost of drilling.
   An artificial-intelligence function was implemented to set up the
   optimum combination of parameters in such a way that the rate of
   penetration (ROP) (m/h) was increased after a number of simulation runs
   while controlling the bit wear. Special attention was focused on tight
   gas reservoirs for selection of the most suitable parameters that
   increase the quality of drill cuttings. It was concluded that the
   roller-cone bit IADC 547 (with at least 0.73 hp in the bit per square
   inch) provides the best-quality cuttings for the Nikanassin Group. This
   is of paramount importance for increasing accuracy in the quantitative
   determination of permeability and porosity from cuttings particularly in
   those tight gas reservoirs where the amount of cores is very limited.
   It is concluded that wells in the Deep Basin of the WCSB can be drilled
   efficiently with seven bit runs while maintaining the cuttings quality,
   bit-wear level, and well stability at a significantly high average ROP
   of 13 m/h. Another conclusion is that the normal trend methods from
   sonic logs are the most effective approach when dealing with an
   abnormally subpressured basin.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the effectiveness of open-joint inter-locking pavers
   in a permeable pavement in cold (winter) conditions. A field-scale
   inter-locking paver cell (UNI Eco-Optiloc (R)) was built to evaluate the
   hydraulic performance and water quality improvements experienced during
   freeze-thaw and frozen conditions in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Hydraulic
   performance was assessed using stormwater runoff reduction (peaks and
   volumes) and surface infiltration capacity. Water quality performance
   for removal of total suspended solids (TSS), total nitrogen (TN), total
   phosphorous (TP) and three heavy metals: copper, lead and zinc, was
   assessed. Results from the study demonstrated that the inter-locking
   pavers were effective in attenuating stormwater runoff peak volumes. The
   surface infiltration capacity decreased significantly due to the
   deposition of sanding and de-icing materials on the pavement surface
   during winter operation. Infiltrated stormwater was stored and treated
   within the pavement structure, which showed removal rates of 91\% for
   TSS, 78\% for TP, 6\% for TN, 68\% for zinc, 69\% for copper and 55\%

   manifested in the dynamic material functions. Similarly, in the
   nonlinear domain the effect of organo-montmorillonite was seen in the
   stress response upon start-up of steady shear stress. The first normal

   433 MHz MICA2 based Cricket platform, which is comprised of 6 Cricket
   motes, at least one of which is mobile. The network utilizes a passive
   architecture in which any mobile mote receives the Beacon signals to

Abstract = {{Injured fireman rescue is an emergent task in firefighting, where a
   rapid localization plays a significant role. For an indoor fire inside a
   building, a distributed system, i.e., a sensor network, can be preset
   surrounding the building for indoor positioning. However, for an
   accidental wildfire, it is intuitively impossible to preset this kind of
   on-site positioning system since the scene of this accident is unknown
   in advance and it is expandable. In this paper, a handset-based
   positioning system using mobile base stations (MBSs) is presented for
   injured fireman rescue in wildfire fighting and is compared with the
   network-based positioning system. This system is built on the scene
   right after the accident occurs and moves according to fire spreading.
   An orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing signal is selected as the
   probing signal for this application, because it has a much greater
   nonambiguity ranging distance than pulse-based ultrawideband signal,
   outperforms pseudorandom noise signal, and is robust against multipath.
   A multiple-access scheme is proposed for all MBS simultaneous
   transmissions without interference. Furthermore, a novel signal
   acquisition and tracking algorithm is proposed using phase correlation
   to further overcome the multipath effect. In addition, the 3-D
   localization and performance are discussed. Simulation results
   demonstrate our proposed system and algorithms.}},

   reactive current as defined by the CPC power theory ensures supply
   current reduction. However, the balance principle of the reactive power
   cannot be applied to the CPC power theory as the definition of the
   reactive power is not a signed quantity. The alternative method which
   uses geometric algebra instead of complex numbers, multivectors in place
   of phasors and the Euclidian N-dimensional space instead of the
   frequency domain succeeds in defining a decomposition that accounts for
   the total nonactive power, and also satisfies conservation. The
   alternative circuit analysis technique allows viewing the flow of
   currents and energy/powers in the circuits under examination.
   Additionally, the paper provides 4 reasons why the present definition of
   apparent power defined as the product of the magnitude of current and
   voltage is unsuitable for nonsinusoidal circuits in the G(N) domain.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of bipolar plate (BPP) channel width on the performance of a
   single-cell direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) stack was investigated.
   Three BPPs with a single-channel serpentine configuration were
   fabricated with three different channel widths having the same effective
   flow areas. Experimental tests showed that the fuel cell with the
   narrowest channel width had the best overall performance while the one
   with the widest channel width had the worst overall performance. A
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed and simulated to
   investigate and understand the reasons for this change in performance.
   The CFD simulation showed that in the narrower channel the diffusion of
   the fuel within the diffusion layer was higher and the fuel distribution
   was more uniform. However, the pressure drop across the inlet and outlet
   was higher in the narrower channel, which increased the pumping power
   requirements. Copyright (c) 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Abstract = {{Introduction: The ovine stifle joint is an ideal preclinical model to
   test the ability of double-bundle reconstruction techniques in providing
   superior joint stability and less osteoarthritis (OA) compared with
   single-bundle techniques. However, knowledge of the normal ovine ACL and
   more specifically the load sharing and physical interaction between the
   two main bundles of the ovine ACL is currently limited.
   Methods: Six ovine stifle joints were tested using a robotic testing
   system. Each joint was cyclically loaded to 200 N in the anterior tibial
   direction between 30 degrees and 90 degrees flexion and the
   force-displacement data were recorded for both the intact ACL, and when
   the anteromedial (AM, n = 3) or the posterolateral bundle (PL, n = 3)
   was transected.
   Results: The load shared by the AM bundle increased from 30 degrees to
   75 degrees of flexion at all loading levels (25-200 N); whereas, the
   load shared by the PL bundle decreased between full extension and mid
   flexion (60 degrees) and then increased again. The load borne by the AM
   bundle did not change in response to increasing Anterior Tibial Loads
   (ATL) at each flexion angle, in contrast to the PL bundle (P = 0.004).
   Physical interaction between bundles was greatest at 60 degrees and
   under 50 N ATL
   Conclusion: These data will help create double-bundle ACL
   reconstructions in sheep which are functionally similar to intact native
   ACL In turn, this model can be used to examine the success of
   anatomically accurate double-bundle reconstructions to prevent the
   development of OA. Level of evidence: III. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Accurate localization of brain activity using blood oxygenation
   level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has
   been challenged because of the large BOLD signal within distal veins.
   Arterial spin labeling (ASL) techniques offer greater sensitivity to the
   microvasculature but possess low temporal resolution and limited brain
   coverage. In this study, we show that the physiological origins of BOLD
   and ASL depend on whether percent change or statistical significance is
   being considered. For BOLD and ASL fMRI data collected during a simple
   unilateral hand movement task, we found that in the area of the
   contralateral motor cortex the centre of gravity (CoG) of the
   intersubject coefficient of variation (CV) of BOLD fMRI was near the
   brain surface for percent change in signal, whereas the CoG of the
   intersubject CV for Z-score was in close proximity of sites of brain
   activity for both BOLD and ASL. These findings suggest that intersubject
   variability of BOLD percent change is vascular in origin, whereas the
   origin of inter-subject variability of Z-score is neuronal for both BOLD
   and ASL. For longer duration tasks (12 s or greater), however, there was
   a significant correlation between BOLD and ASL percent change, which was
   not evident for short duration tasks (6 s). These findings suggest that
   analyses directly comparing percent change in BOLD signal between
   pre-defined regions of interest using short duration stimuli, as for
   example in event-related designs, may be heavily weighted by
   large-vessel responses rather than neuronal responses. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Title = {{A new ductility model of reinforced concrete beams strengthened using
   Fiber Reinforced Polymer reinforcement}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{3338-3347}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Despite the superior performance of Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) as
   compared with conventional steel bars in terms of high
   strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance, and high fatigue
   performance, FRP strengthened beams exhibit lower ductility due to the
   linear elastic response of the FRP reinforcement. Several ductility and
   deformability models were developed in order to account for the elastic
   behavior, i.e. high elastic energy, of FRP when used for strengthening
   existing steel reinforced concrete or for new construction. In this
   paper, a new ductility expression that relates the deformability of a
   reinforced concrete (RC) structure strengthened using FRP to the energy
   dissipated, was developed. The developed expression also considers the
   type of loading, static or fatigue. The new expression was validated
   against experimental test results of RC beams strengthened using
   prestressed Near Surface Mounted (NSM) carbon FRP un-fatigued and
   fatigued beams. Furthermore, the ductility index at which the
   deformability of the structure equals the ratio of total energy
   dissipated to elastic energy, defined as the optimum ductility index,
   was investigated for both the un-fatigued and fatigued beams. The
   prestress strain corresponding to the optimum ductility index was found
   to be 2830 mu epsilon (the strain value can be determined using an
   accepted arbitrary test such as monotonic test) while no optimum
   ductility was achieved for the case of the un-fatigued beams. It is
   noteworthy that the optimum ductility index is subject to the
   variability of design, beam geometry, and prestressing level. Therefore,
   the ductility evaluation of the NSM CFRP strengthened beams was meant to
   give only an insight into the problem and not to propose certain limits.

Abstract = {{A broadband digital beamforming algorithm is proposed for directional
   filtering of temporally-broadband bandpass space-time plane-waves at
   radio frequencies (RFs). The enhancement of desired waves, as well as
   rejection of undesired interfering plane-waves, is simulated. A
   systolic- and wavefront-array architecture is proposed for the real-time
   implementation of second-order spatially-bandpass (SBP) 2-D infinite
   impulse response (IIR) beam filters having potential applications in
   broadband beamforming of temporally down-converted RF signals. The
   higher speed of operation and potentially reduced power consumption of
   the asynchronous architecture of wavefront-array processors (WAPs) in
   comparison to the conventional synchronous hardware has emerging
   applications in radio-astronomy, radar, navigation, space science,
   cognitive radio, and wireless communications. Further, the bit error
   rate (BER) performance improvement along with the reduced computational
   complexity of the 2-D IIR SBP frequency-planar digital filter over
   digital phased array feed (PAF) beamformer is provided. A nominal BER
   versus signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) gain of 10-16 dB compared to
   case where beamforming is not applied, and a gain of 2-3 dB at
   approximately half the number of parallel multipliers to digital PAF,
   are observed. The results of application-specific integrated circuit
   (ASIC) synthesis of the digital filter designs are also presented.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a design methodology for dual-band Doherty power
   amplifier (DPA) with performance enhancement using dual-band phase
   offset lines. In the proposed architecture, 50-Omega dual-band offset
   lines with arbitrary electric lengths at two frequencies are key
   components, and a novel analytical design solution has been proposed for
   their design and implementation. The methodology is validated with the
   design and fabrication of a 10-W GaN-based DPA for code division
   multiple access and Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access
   applications at 1960 and 3500 MHz, respectively. The dual-band Doherty
   amplifier using the proposed design methodology has better performance
   than the current state of the art. The peak drain efficiency of the
   amplifier is 59.5\% at the first frequency and 49.6\% at the second
   frequency of operation. Compared to balanced mode operation, there is an
   improvement of more than 10\% in drain efficiencies, around 6.5-dB
   back-off, at both frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{In this work the reaction kinetics for pyridine hydrodenitrogenation on
   (Ni)WP/SiO2 catalysts were determined. The experiments were conducted at
   17.2 bar and between 573 K and 633 K for various flow rates of hydrogen
   and pyridine. Adding Ni to the WP/SiO2 catalyst enhanced the
   hydrogenation reaction and gave higher pentane and pentylamine yields. A
   trend in terms of selectivity was not evident on either catalyst. The
   results were fit to several models and a Bayesian approach was applied
   for parameter estimation and model discrimination. Adding Ni to the
   WP/SiO2 catalyst did not change the reaction mechanism - both catalysts
   favor the same Langmuir-Hinshelwood model with different active sites
   for hydrogenation and C-N bond cleavage. Ni did, however, influence the
   type of adsorbed species, the heat of adsorption and the activation
   energies. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Differential thermogravimetry (DTG) and differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC) plots help identifying reaction zones and enable

   major shifts in the DTG combustion peaks and reaction zones between
   virgin and adsorbed asphaltenes onto commercial metal oxide
   nanoparticles. They attributed the accompanying reduction in activation
   energy to a significant catalytic role played by the nanoparticles,
   especially for NiO nanoparticles. It should be noted that in these
   experiments only monolayer adsorption from toluene model solutions was
   encountered. More recently, our group reported multilayer adsorption of
   asphaltenes from heavy oils onto in situ prepared and commercial NiO
   nanoparticles {[}3]. Contrary to the previous literature, the thermal
   behavior of these asphaltenes revealed a surface role entailing an
   enhanced exposure of adsorbed asphaltenes to the oxidant stream. In this
   work, we critically re-evaluated the claim of catalytic effect of
   nanoparticles {[}1,2,4,5] and provide an experimental protocol which

   The multistep drainage process consists of a series of drainage

   through regression of the wetting phase recovery history. The
   assumptions used in deriving the analytical model are examined by

Abstract = {{The design of solvent-based and solvent assisted heavy oil recovery
   processes requires accurate predictions of phase behavior as
   straightforward as saturation pressures and as potentially complex as
   vapour-liquid-liquid equilibria and asphaltene precipitation. It is a
   challenge to predict this variety of phase behavior from a single fluid
   model. In this study, saturation pressures of dead and live Peace River
   bitumen were measured in a Jefri PVT cell at different concentrations of
   a multi-component solvent at temperatures from 20 to 180 degrees C.
   Saturation pressures and the onset of asphaltene precipitation were also
   measured for the bitumen diluted with n-pentane. The onset of
   precipitation was determined by titrating the bitumen with pentane and
   periodically circulating the mixture past a high pressure microscope.
   Literature data including saturation pressures and liquid-liquid phase
   boundaries for pseudo-binaries of bitumen and carbon dioxide, methane,
   ethane, and propane were also evaluated.
   The data were modeled with the Advanced Peng-Robinson Equation-of-State
   (APR EoS). The maltene fraction of the bitumen was characterized into
   pseudo-components based on extrapolated distillation data. The
   asphaltenes were characterized based on a Gamma distribution of the
   molecular weights of self-associated asphaltenes. The APR EoS was tuned
   to fit the saturation pressure and asphaltene onset data of the
   pseudo-binaries by adjusting the binary interaction parameter between
   the solvent and the bitumen pseudo-components. A temperature dependent
   binary interaction parameter correlation was developed for the
   interaction parameters. The model fit the saturation pressures and onset
   of asphaltene precipitation over a wide range of temperatures. The model
   predicted liquid-liquid boundaries as well as the saturation pressures
   of live oil and live oil diluted with condensate solvent, generally
   within experimental error. The model also predicted the asphaltene onset
   in propane diluted bitumen. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Integer ambiguity resolution in Precise Point Positioning (PPP) can
   improve positioning accuracy and reduce convergence time. The decoupled
   clock model proposed by Collins (2008) has been used to facilitate
   integer ambiguity resolution in PPP, and research has been conducted to
   assess the model's potential to improve positioning accuracy and reduce
   positioning convergence time. In particular, the biggest benefits have
   been identified for the positioning solutions within short observation
   periods such as one hour. However, there is little work reported about
   the model's potential to improve the estimation of the tropospheric
   parameter within short observation periods. This paper investigates the
   effect of PPP ambiguity resolution on the accuracy of the tropospheric
   estimates within one hour.
   The tropospheric estimates with float and fixed ambiguities within one
   hour are compared to two external references. The first reference is the
   International GNSS Service (IGS) final troposphere product based on the
   PPP technique. The second reference is the Constellation Observing
   System for Meteorology Ionosphere and Climate (COSMIC) radio occultation
   (RO) event based on the atmospheric profiles along the signal travel
   path. A comparison among ten co-located ground-based GPS and space-based
   RO troposphere zenith path delays shows that the mean bias of the
   troposphere estimates with float ambiguities can be significantly
   reduced from 30.1 to 17.0 mm when compared to the IGS troposphere
   product and from 36.3 to 19.7 mm when compared to the COSMIC RO. The
   root mean square (RMS) accuracy improvement of the tropospheric
   parameters by the ambiguity resolution is 33.3\% when compared to the
   IGS products and 44.3\% when compared to the COSMIC RO. All these
   improvements are achieved within one hour, which indicates the promising
   prospect of adopting PPP integer ambiguity resolution for time-critical
   applications such as typhoon prediction. (C) 2012 COSPAR. Published by

Abstract = {{Integrating intracranial EEG (iEEG) with functional MRI (iEEG-fMRI) may
   help elucidate mechanisms underlying the generation of seizures.
   However, the introduction of iEEG electrodes in the MR environment has
   inherent risk and data quality implications that require consideration

   have confirmed low risk under specific circumstances at 1.5 land 3 T.
   However, no studies have assessed risk and image quality related to the
   feasibility of a full iEEG-fMRI protocol. To this end, commercially
   available platinum subdural grid/strip electrodes (4 x 5 grid or 1 x 8
   strip) and 4 or 6-contact depth electrodes were secured to the surface
   of a custom-made phantom mimicking the conductivity of the human brain.

   contacts were measured in a GE Discovery MR750 3 T MR scanner during a
   variety of imaging sequences, typical of an iEEG-fMRI protocol. An
   electrode grid was also used to quantify the spatial extent of
   susceptibility artifact. The spatial extent of susceptibility artifact
   in the presence of an electrode was also assessed for typical imaging
   parameters that maximize BOLD sensitivity at 3 T (TR = 1500 ms; TE = 30
   ms; slice thickness = 4 mm; matrix = 64 x 64; field-of-view = 24 cm).
   Under standard conditions, all electrodes exhibited no measurable
   displacement and no clinically significant temperature increase (<1
   degrees C) during scans employed in a typical iEEG-fMRI experiment,
   including 60 min of continuous fMRI. However, high SAR sequences, such
   as fast spin-echo (FSE), produced significant heating in almost all
   scenarios (>2.0 degrees C) that in some cases exceeded 10 degrees C.
   Induced voltages in the frequency range that could elicit neuronal
   stimulation (<10 kHz) were well below the threshold of 100 mV. fMRI
   signal intensity was significantly reduced within 20 mm of the
   electrodes for the imaging parameters used in this study. Thus, for the
   conditions tested, a full iEEG-fMRI protocol poses a low risk at 3 T;
   however, fMRI sensitivity may be reduced immediately adjacent to the
   electrodes. In addition, high SAR sequences must be avoided. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Although deployed in the vasculature to expand vessel diameter and
   improve blood flow, protruding stent struts can create complex flow
   environments associated with flow separation and oscillating shear
   gradients. Given the association between magnitude and direction of wall
   shear stress (WSS) and endothelial phenotype expression, accurate
   representation of stent-induced flow patterns is critical if we are to
   predict sites susceptible to intimal hyperplasia. Despite the number of
   stents approved for clinical use, quantification on the alteration of
   hemodynamic flow parameters associated with the Gianturco Z-stent is
   limited in the literature. In using experimental and computational
   models to quantify strut-induced flow, the majority of past work has
   assumed blood or representative analogs to behave as Newtonian fluids.
   However, recent studies have challenged the validity of this assumption.
   We present here the experimental quantification of flow through a
   Gianturco Z-stent wire in representative Newtonian and non-Newtonian
   blood analog environments using particle image velocimetry (PIV). Fluid
   analogs were circulated through a closed flow loop at physiologically
   appropriate flow rates whereupon PIV snapshots were acquired downstream
   of the wire housed in an acrylic tube with a diameter characteristic of
   the carotid artery. Hemodynamic parameters including WSS, oscillatory
   shear index (OSI), and Reynolds shear stresses (RSS) were measured. Our
   findings show that the introduction of the stent wire altered downstream
   hemodynamic parameters through a reduction in WSS and increases in OSI
   and RSS from nonstented flow. The Newtonian analog solution of glycerol
   and water underestimated WSS while increasing the spatial coverage of
   flow reversal and oscillatory shear compared to a non-Newtonian fluid of
   glycerol, water, and xanthan gum. Peak RSS were increased with the
   Newtonian fluid, although peak values were similar upon a doubling of
   flow rate. The introduction of the stent wire promoted the development
   of flow patterns that are susceptible to intimal hyperplasia using both
   Newtonian and non-Newtonian analogs, although the magnitude of sites
   affected downstream was appreciably related to the rheological behavior
   of the analog. While the assumption of linear viscous behavior is often
   appropriate in quantifying flow in the largest arteries of the
   vasculature, the results presented here suggest this assumption
   overestimates sites susceptible to hyperplasia and restenosis in flow
   characterized by low and oscillatory shear. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4007746]}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{101-109}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Time-of-flight range camera data are prone to the scattering bias caused
   by multiple internal reflections of light received from a highly
   reflective object in the camera's foreground that induce a phase shift
   in the light received from background targets. The corresponding range
   bias can have serious implications on the quality of data of captured
   scenes as well as the geometric self-calibration of range cameras. In
   order to minimise the impact of the scattering range biases, the
   calibration must be performed over a planar target field rather than a
   more desirable 3D target field. This significantly impacts the quality
   of the rangefinder offset parameter estimation due to its high
   correlation with the camera perspective centre position. In this
   contribution a new model to compensate for scattering-induced range
   errors is proposed that allows range camera self-calibration to be
   conducted over a 3D target field. Developed from experimental
   observations of scattering behaviour under specific scene conditions, it
   comprises four new additional parameters that are estimated in the
   self-calibrating bundle adjustment. The results of experiments conducted
   on five range camera datasets demonstrate the model's efficacy in
   compensating for the scattering error without compromising model
   fidelity. It is further demonstrated that it actually reduces the
   rangefinder offset-perspective centre correlation and its use with a 3D
   target field is the preferred method for calibrating narrow
   field-of-view range cameras. (c) 2012 International Society for

Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{The unusually high primary recovery factors (RFs) observed in numerous
   heavy-oil reservoirs are often attributed to foamy oil flow (i.e., the
   non-Darcy flow involving formation and flow of gas-in-oil dispersion).
   It occurs when the wells are produced aggressively at high drawdown
   pressures that led to conditions in which the viscous forces become
   sufficiently strong to overcome the capillary forces in pushing
   dispersed bubbles through pore throats. The role of gravitational forces
   in generating such dispersed flow has not been studied adequately. This
   work was intended to evaluate the contribution of gravitational forces
   in primary depletion of heavy-oil formations under foamy flow
   conditions.
   Primary-depletion tests were conducted in a 200-cm-long sandpack that
   was held in either horizontal or vertical orientation. The results of
   horizontal depletion tests were compared with the depletion tests
   conducted with the sandpack in the vertical direction. Vertical
   depletions showed better recoveries at slower depletion rates compared
   with horizontal depletions.
   The RFs of both horizontal and vertical depletions were correlated
   against the average drawdown pressure available to move the oil. It was
   found that the RF shows a strong dependence on the average drawdown
   pressure. It was also found that the curve of RF vs. average drawdown
   pressure moves slightly toward higher recoveries in the presence of an
   added foaming agent (i.e., with increased oil foaminess).}},

Abstract = {{Mobile lidar (light detection and ranging) data collection is a rapidly
   emerging technology in which multiple georeferenced sensors (e.g., laser
   scanners, cameras) are mounted on a moving vehicle to collect real world
   data. The photorealistic modeling of large-scale real world scenes such
   as urban environments has become increasingly interesting to the vision,
   graphics, and photogrammetry communities. In this paper, we present an
   automatic approach to window and facade detection from mobile lidar
   data. The proposed method combines bottom-up with top-down strategies to
   extract facade planes from noisy lidar point clouds. The window
   detection is achieved through a two-step approach: potential window
   point detection and window localization. The facade pattern is
   automatically inferred to enhance the robustness of the window
   detection. Experimental results on six datasets result in 71.2 percent
   and 88.9 percent in the first two datasets, 100 percent for the rest
   four datasets in terms of completeness rate, and 100 percent correctness
   rate for all the tested datasets, which demonstrate the effectiveness of
   the proposed solution for planar facades with rectilinear windows. The
   application potential includes generation of building facade models with
   street-level details and texture synthesis for producing realistic
   occlusion-free facade texture.}},

Abstract = {{Investigations were made on the influence of slope on the spatial

   hillslopes were identified from field measurements over various moisture
   conditions. Results indicated that duff moisture is not related to soil
   moisture, nor is it controlled by a hydraulic gradient. The spatial
   pattern of duff moisture over a 2?week period was established along two
   2?m by 60?m hillslope transects that were sampled every 3?m. Because of
   interception, tree proximity was found to be the primary factor that
   significantly influenced the spatial variation in duff moisture. As the
   duff dried, the influence of tree proximity decreased. The distance from
   the top of the hillslope was not found to be an important factor in duff
   moisture variability. The spatial variation in duff moisture is more
   prominent during periods of wetness because of the exponential nature of
   the duff drying curve. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A digital beamformer that can synthesize array factors (AFs) with
   multiple, ultrawideband (UWB), frequency-in-dependent beams at lower
   computational complexity is proposed. The beamformer is based on a novel
   3-D infinite impulse response (IIR) transfer function H-MC (z) having
   multiple cone-shaped passbands in the 3-D spatio-temporal (ST)
   frequency-domain. omega is an element of R-3. The magnitude frequency
   response and the AF of H-MC (z) are simulated for dual-and
   single-passband cases. An element pattern of a broadband Vivaldi antenna
   is simulated at 1.4 GHz and is used to obtain the total array pattern.
   Computational complexity of H-MC (z) for single-passband (1Cone) case
   and that of the conventional phased array (PA) beamformer are derived.
   The magnitude frequency response of the proposed beamformer for 1Cone
   case and that of the PA beamformer are compared using the mean square
   error (MSE). For the given selectivity specified by the half cone angle
   epsilon = 5 degrees, proposed beamformer provides around 60\% lower MSE
   for the same complexity and around 90\% lower complexity for the same
   MSE compared with the PA beamformer.}},

Abstract = {{Extreme snow avalanche runout is typically estimated using a combination
   of historical and vegetation records as well as statistical and dynamic
   models. The two classes of statistical models (alpha beta and runout
   ratio) are based on estimating runout distance past the beta-point,
   which is typically defined as the point where the avalanche slope
   incline first decreases to 10. The parameters for these models vary from
   mountain range to mountain range. In Canada, alpha-beta and runout ratio
   parameters have been published for the combined Rocky and Purcell
   Mountains and for the British Columbia Coast Mountains. Despite active
   development, no suitable tall avalanche path model parameters have been
   published for the Columbia Mountains or for the Lizard Range area around
   Fernie, B.C. Using a dataset of 65 avalanche paths, statistical model
   parameters have been derived for these regions.}},

Abstract = {{Measurement errors (in-phase/quadrature imbalance, dc offset, and
   nonlinearity) in the feedback path can adversely affect the
   linearization performance of digital predistorter (DPD) for RF power
   amplifiers (PAs). In this paper, a generalized analysis for the
   Volterra-series DPD system is presented in the presence of feedback
   measurement errors. It shows that the DPD coefficients are biased due to
   these errors. A modified least squares (MLS) method is then proposed for
   DPD coefficients extraction, which can eliminate the detrimental effect
   of feedback measurement errors without using a post-compensator. The
   proposed MLS method has the advantage of being free of behavioral
   modeling for the feedback path or the post-compensator. However, it can
   still achieve comparable performance as the state-of-the-art. The
   performance of the MLS method is validated with both simulations and
   experiments. The measurement results show that, when a nonideal feedback
   path is employed to capture the PA output, the proposed MLS method can
   still ensure a high linearization performance of the DPD, and the
   results are nearly the same as that when an ideal feedback path is used.}},

Abstract = {{The primary objective of this work was to determine the effect of
   emulsified water on the onset and the amount of asphaltene precipitation
   from diluted crude oils. Asphaltene precipitation yields were measured
   from an Athabasca bitumen and a Gulf of Mexico crude oil diluted with
   n-heptane. The experiments were performed with and without emulsified
   water added to the oils. Yields were compared to determine the effect of
   the emulsified water. At dilution ratios above the onset of
   precipitation for dewatered oils, yields were observed to be same for
   both dewatered oils and oils emulsified with water. Hence, the presence
   of water had no detectable effect on the solubility of asphaltenes in a
   crude oil. However, asphaltenes adsorbed on the surface of emulsified
   water droplets were removed with the water droplets and reported as
   yield below the onset. The secondary objective of this work was to
   analyze the compositional differences between the asphaltenes
   precipitated at the onset condition, asphaltenes adsorbed onto the
   interface, and bulk asphaltenes. On the basis of CHNSO analysis, it was
   found that there is no compositional difference between these three
   different asphaltenes.}},

Abstract = {{Large volumes of geospatial data are increasingly made available through
   dynamic networks, such as ad hoc networks. Consequently, new adapted
   query propagation approaches that take into account geospatial aspects
   of data are needed. Different existing query propagation approaches use
   various criteria to select relevant sources. In addition, many
   approaches rely on existing semantic mappings between sources: however,
   in ad hoc networks, sources move autonomously and in a dynamic fashion.
   Our goal is rather to reduce the number of sources that must be accessed
   to answer a query and, therefore, to reduce the volume of semantic
   mappings that needs to be computed to answer the query. In this paper,
   we propose three real time query propagation strategies to address this
   issue. Those strategies reproduce the behavior of members of a social
   network. The strategies are designed to be part of a real time semantic
   interoperability framework for ad hoc networks of geospatial databases.
   The strategies have been formalized with the Lightweight Coordination
   Calculus (LCC), which support distributed interactions based on social
   norms and constraints. The implementation and testing of the strategies
   show that they complement each other to provide optimal query answers.

Abstract = {{The recently developed integrated Precise Point Positioning (PPP)
   GPS/INS system can be useful to many applications, such as UAV
   navigation systems, land vehicle/machine automation and mobile mapping
   systems. Since carrier phase measurements are the primary observables in
   PPP GPS, cycle slips, which often occur due to high dynamics, signal
   obstructions and low satellite elevation, must be detected and repaired
   in order to ensure the navigation performance. In this research, a new
   algorithm of cycle slip detection and identification has been developed.
   With the aiding from INS, the proposed method jointly uses WL and EWL
   phase combinations to uniquely determine cycle slips in the L1 and L2
   frequencies. To verify the efficiency of the algorithm, both
   tactical-grade and consumer-grade IMUs are tested by using a real
   dataset collected from two field tests. The results indicate that the
   proposed algorithm can efficiently detect and identify the cycle slips
   and subsequently improve the navigation performance of the integrated
   system.}},

Abstract = {{The automatic interpretation of human gestures can be used for a natural
   interaction with computers while getting rid of mechanical devices such
   as keyboards and mice. In order to achieve this objective, the
   recognition of hand postures has been studied for many years. However,
   most of the literature in this area has considered 2D images which
   cannot provide a full description of the hand gestures. In addition, a
   rotation-invariant identification remains an unsolved problem, even with
   the use of 2D images. The objective of the current study was to design a
   rotation-invariant recognition process while using a 3D signature for
   classifying hand postures. A heuristic and voxel-based signature has
   been designed and implemented. The tracking of the hand motion is
   achieved with the Kalman filter. A unique training image per posture is
   used in the supervised classification. The designed recognition process,
   the tracking procedure and the segmentation algorithm have been
   successfully evaluated. This study has demonstrated the efficiency of
   the proposed rotation invariant 3D hand posture signature which leads to
   93.88\% recognition rate after testing 14,732 samples of 12 postures
   taken from the alphabet of the American Sign Language.}},

Abstract = {{Bioretention cells are an emerging low impact development technology
   that address urban stormwater runoff concerns. Field and column
   experiments were conducted to assess the efficacy of bioretention cells
   in cold conditions. Field experiments in a prairie environment
   demonstrated a significant decrease (91.5\%) in effluent volumes
   compared to influent volumes. The majority (similar to 60\%) of the
   runoff percolated to the surrounding soils or evapotranspirated. Cold
   condition performance significantly impacted high volume events and was
   characterized by significantly higher effluent volumes, significantly
   lower runoff storage, higher effluent peak flow rates, and longer peak
   delays. A partially frozen surface layer caused the changes in
   performance. Long-term simulation experiments on the columns indicated a
   significant decrease in saturated hydraulic conductivity over the first
   4 equivalent years of operation, before levelling to a constant value.}},

Abstract = {{Field and column experiments were conducted to test the ability of
   bioretention cells to improve urban runoff quality. The effects of cold
   climate conditions, media depth, long-term operation, and extreme
   loading were analyzed. Field experiments demonstrated significant
   decrease in contaminant mass, which was a function of the large runoff
   volume capture. Significant decreases in concentration for sediment
   (96\%), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD, 8\%), and total phosphorus
   (0.6\%) were noted. Long-term simulation experiments demonstrated a
   decrease in effluent concentration over time, suggesting a dependence on
   media chemistry. Sediment and BOD capture remained high throughout the
   testing period. Media depth did not impact performance in laboratory
   experiments. Extreme loading experiments proved that the effluent
   concentration of contaminants was independent of the influent
   concentration. Cold climate conditions did not have a significant impact
   on performance in both field and column experiments.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The iterative optimizations often used to identify Wiener-Hammerstein
   models, pairs of linear filters separated by memoryless nonlinearities,
   require good initial estimates of the linear elements in order to avoid
   them getting caught in local minima. Previous work has shown that
   initial estimates of the two linear elements can be formed by splitting
   the poles and zeros of the best linear approximation of the
   Wiener-Hammerstein system between the two linear elements, an approach
   which can generate a large number of initializations. This paper
   develops a scanning technique that can efficiently evaluate each of the
   proposed initializations using estimates of some carefully constructed
   nonlinear characteristics of the system, estimates which can be formed
   using linear system identification techniques after some data
   preprocessing. This approach results in a much smaller number, often
   only one, of potential starting points for the optimization. The
   proposed algorithm is demonstrated using a Monte Carlo simulation using
   data from the SYSID 2009 Wiener-Hammerstein Benchmark system. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Genetic engineering of stem cells and their derivatives has the
   potential to enhance their regenerative capabilities. Here, dendrimer-
   and lipofection-based approaches were used for non-viral neurotrophin-3
   (NT-3) over-expression in Schwann cells differentiated from skin
   precursors (SKP-SCs). A variety of dendrimers were first tested for
   transfection efficiency on HEK 293T cells, with PAMAM-NH2 G4 found most
   effective and used subsequently for SKP-SCs transfection. Plasmid-based
   expression resulted in increased NT-3 release from SKP-SCs in both
   adherent and microcarrier-based culture. In a proof-of-concept study,
   the microcarrier/SKP-SCs were implanted into the injured nerve, and
   transfected cells were shown to detach, integrate into the nerve tissue
   and associate with regenerating axons. Virus-free systems for transient
   neurotrophin expression are a feasible and biologically safe option to
   increase the therapeutic value of stem cells and stem cell-derived cells
   in nerve repair strategies. Further work to develop bioprocesses for
   expansion of SKP-SCs on microcarriers in bioreactors is still needed.}},

Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{2093-2105}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new closed loop dynamic state estimation (DSE) method
   is proposed providing state forecasts (before receiving the
   corresponding measurements) in addition to state estimation (after
   receiving the measurements). This method comprises a new stochastic
   search technique and scenario generation approach. The proposed
   stochastic search technique, benefiting from high search capability, is
   a new hybridization of differential evolution and bacterial foraging
   methods. The suggested scenario generation approach is composed of bus
   load prediction, lattice Monte Carlo simulation (LMCS) and optimal power
   flow (OPF). This approach can model bus load forecast uncertainty. Most
   of existing state estimation methods (such as weighted least square) can
   provide state estimations only in cases that the power system is
   observable. However, the proposed DSE method can solve the state
   estimation problem for both observable and unobservable power systems
   with reasonable accuracy. The proposed DSE method is extensively tested
   on the well-known IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus test systems with
   different sets of measurements and its obtained results are compared
   with the results of some other state estimation methods. These
   comparisons confirm the validity of the developed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Path planning can be viewed as an optimization process in which an
   optimum path between two points is to be found under some predefined
   constraints. Some typical constraints are path length, fuel consumption,
   and path safety factor. Exact algorithms such as linear programming (LP)
   and dynamic programming (DP) are widely adopted in vehicle maneuvering
   systems. However, as the problem domain scales up, exact algorithms
   suffer from high computational complexity. In contrast, metaheuristic
   algorithms such as evolutionary algorithms (EA) and genetic algorithms
   (GA) can provide suboptimum solutions without the full understanding of
   the problem domain. Metaheuristic algorithms are capable of providing
   decent solutions within a finite period of time, even for large-scaled
   problems. In this paper, a GA-inspired unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV)
   path planner based on DP is proposed. Simulation results show that the
   proposed algorithm can outperform a GA-based UUV path planner in terms
   of speed and solution quality.}},

Abstract = {{A discrete element model (DEM) is used to study the mechanical behaviour
   of a pre-fractured brittle medium subjected to triaxial loadings where
   progressive failure can occur. The initial discrete fracture network
   (DFN) is based on a fractal distribution and it is used to characterize
   the influence of clustering and size distribution of pre-existing
   fractures, on the strength of fractured rock masses. The proposed
   approach captures the progressive failure process occurring in the rock
   matrix as shearing displacement takes place along pre-existing
   discontinuities. The results show that the mechanical behaviour of
   fractured rock masses is mainly dependent on the fracture intensity.
   However, for a given fracture intensity, the strength can exhibit a 50
   per cent variability depending on the size distribution of the
   pre-existing fractures. This difference can be attributed to the
   different mechanisms that involve sliding and crushing of blocks in the
   case of large interconnected fractures or progressive failure of the
   rock matrix through coalescence of cracks in the case of small
   unconnected fractures. Clustering of fractures was found to influence
   the spatial variability of the mechanical properties and therefore to
   have a scale effect on strength. The results outline the relevance of
   three parameters, the power-law exponent of the fracture size
   distribution, the clustering fractal dimension which fixes the
   fracture-to-fracture correlation number and the fracture intensity, to
   characterize the mechanical behaviour of rock masses.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents an analytical method to design a hybrid structure
   dual-band rat-race coupler at microwave frequencies. The proposed
   structure uses six identical cells of which each is engineered to work
   as a quarter wavelength transmission line with proper characteristic
   impedance at two distinct frequencies having arbitrary frequency ratio.
   The performances of the p- and T-cells are studied to assess their
   ability to provide the required electrical parameters for dual-band
   operation. It is demonstrated that the single-section p-topology can
   only lead to a suboptimal design for a dual-band rat-race cell at two
   nonharmonic frequencies. In contrast, the proposed double-section p-cell
   structure allows achieving an optimal dual-band cell design. A dual-band
   rat-race coupler designed at 2.14 and 3.6 GHz has been simulated and
   fabricated in hybrid microstrip technology. Measurement results agree
   well with analytically based simulation results, which demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed structure for dual-band operation. (C)

Abstract = {{In this work, the effect of plastic strain on corrosion of an X100

   While the steel corrosion is enhanced by applied strain, the effect of
   elastic deformation is limited. The mechanoelectrochemical effect
   developed on the steel is small in elastic region, and it becomes
   significant under plastic strain. While both anodic and cathodic
   reactions are enhanced by pre-strain, the effect on anodic reaction is
   more significant. Furthermore, in reality, a non-uniform distribution of
   plastic stress and strain on pipelines would cause quite different
   corrosion activities on the steel. This could be the reason to initiate
   preferential localized corrosion and even cracks. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This study compares electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding
   properties of injection molded versus compression molded multi-walled
   carbon nanotube/polystyrene (MWCNT/PS) composites, i.e., properties such
   as EMI shielding effectiveness (EMI SE), electrical conductivity, real
   permittivity and imaginary permittivity. The injection molded
   (MWCNT-aligned) samples showed lower EMI shielding properties than
   compression molded (randomly distributed MWCNT) samples that was
   attributed to lower probability of MWCNTs contacting each other due to
   MWCNT alignment. The compression molded samples showed higher electrical
   conductivity and lower electrical percolation threshold than the
   injection molded samples. The compression molded samples at MWCNT
   concentrations of 5.00 and 20.0 wt.\% showed real permittivity two times
   and imaginary permittivity five times greater than the injection molded
   samples. The EMI SE for the compression molded samples at MWCNT
   concentrations of 5.00 and 20.0 wt.\% was 15.0 and 30.0 dB,
   respectively, significantly greater than EMI SE for the injection molded
   samples. Lower EMI SE for the injection molded samples was ascribed to
   lower electrical conductivity, real permittivity (polarization loss) and
   imaginary permittivity (Ohmic loss). Comparison of the EMI shielding
   properties of the compression molded versus injection molded samples
   confirmed that EMI shielding does not require filler connectivity;
   however it increases with filler connectivity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The paper presents valuing of qualitative and quantitative travel
   attributes influencing the attractiveness of suburban train service in
   Mumbai city, India. A stated preference experiment is designed to
   capture the data of sub-urban train mode choice behavior. The behavioral
   data are analyzed using different modeling techniques such as
   multinomial logit (MNL) and mixed logit (ML). In ML model, the random
   parameters are assumed to follow constrained triangular distribution,
   where mean equals its spread. The decomposition of preference
   heterogeneity around the mean estimate of random parameter is also
   investigated using ML model. The study shows the influence of headway
   time and train ride time associated with a particular crowding level
   (expressed in density of standing passengers/m(2)) in choosing the
   sub-urban train mode by calculating their willingness-to-pay (WTP)
   values and highlights the importance of WTP for addressing policy issues
   in the reduction of in-vehicle crowding level. The present study
   documents new findings of the effect of crowding level on train ride
   time in the context of a developing country and suggests some important
   directions for future suburban train transport crowding valuation

Abstract = {{The (vapor + liquid) equilibrium data for binary systems of (methane +

   temperature over a wide range of pressures, (1 to 8) MPa, were measured
   using a designed pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) apparatus. The phase
   composition and saturated density of liquid phase were measured for each
   pressure. The density of pure methanol, ethanol and 1-propanol was also
   measured at ambient temperature over a wide range of pressure (1 to 10)
   MPa. The experimental (vapor + liquid) equilibrium data were compared
   with the modeling results obtained using the Peng-Robinson and
   Soave-Redlich-Kwong equations of state. To improve the predictions, the
   binary interaction parameters were adjusted and the volume translation
   technique was applied. Both equations of state were found to be capable
   of describing the phase equilibria of these systems over the range of
   studied conditions. The Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state gave
   better predictions of saturated liquid densities than Peng-Robinson

Abstract = {{Imaging the brain in animal models enables scientists to unravel new
   biological insights. Despite critical advancements in recent years, most
   laboratory imaging techniques comprise of bulky bench top apparatus that
   require the imaged animals to be anesthetized and immobilized. Thus,
   animals are imaged in their non-native state severely restricting the
   scope of behavioral experiments. To address this gap, we report a
   miniaturized microscope that can be mounted on a rat's head for imaging
   in awake and unrestrained conditions. The microscope uses laser speckle
   contrast imaging (LSCI), a high resolution yet wide field imaging
   modality for imaging blood vessels and perfusion. Design details of both
   the image formation and acquisition modules are presented. A Monte Carlo
   simulation was used to estimate the depth of tissue penetration
   achievable by the imaging system while the produced speckle Airy disc
   patterns were simulated using Fresnel's diffraction theory. The
   microscope system weighs only 7 g and occupies less than 5 cm(3) and was
   successfully used to generate proof of concept LSCI images of rat brain
   vasculature. We validated the utility of the head-mountable system in an
   awake rat brain model by confirming no impairment to the rat's native
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{At-grade distribution systems for wastewater treatment represent
   potential sources of nutrient input to the environment. The efficacy of
   nutrient treatment in the vadose zone below an at-grade distribution
   system receiving secondary treated municipal wastewater effluent was
   studied on silt loam soil at a site in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, where
   there are large seasonal temperature fluctuations and cold winter
   conditions. In addition to wastewater effluent characterization, field
   monitoring of pore water chemistry, soil temperature, and interstitial
   soil gas concentrations was conducted at five different depths (up to
   150 cm below surface) over the 47-week effluent dosing period. Results
   showed that ammonium-N from the applied effluent was effectively
   nitrified in the top 30 cm of the soil profile. While there was evidence
   for subsequent nitrate removal by denitrification in this same zone, it
   was limited to the warm summer months and did not appear to result in
   significant nitrogen mass removal (5-15\%) at greater depths in the soil
   profile. Phosphate was rapidly attenuated in the top 60 cm of the soil
   profile. This study demonstrated the importance of climatic conditions
   on biochemical nitrogen transformations in the shallow subsurface and
   suggested a greater potential for nitrate leaching to groundwater in the
   winter. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0000560. (C) 2012 American

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The evolution of an isolated line vortex generated by a starting
   two-dimensional jet is studied experimentally using time-resolved
   particle image velocimetry. The vortex growth in this current
   configuration is not linked to any externally imposed length scales or
   interactions with other vortical structures or walls that could
   potentially influence vortex growth. A model for the early-stage vortex
   growth, based on the transport of circulation from the shear layer into
   the vortex, is proposed and found to agree well with experimental data.
   The model provides a scaling scheme for vortex growth using shear-layer
   characteristic velocity and shear-layer thickness. The vortex growth is
   limited through a gradual separation of the vortex from the feeding
   shear layer, arising from decreased shear-layer curvature. This
   phenomenon is linked to a competition between the shear-layer tendency
   to remain in the streamwise direction and the induced velocity from the
   vortex on the shear layer. Finally, a dimensionless number representing
   this competition is introduced, which in turn is able to describe the
   gradual separation of the vortex from the shear layer. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an experimental study of the sensitivities of the

   the behavioural modelling and linearization of RF power amplifiers

   versus identification, we assess the performances of these models under
   different signal bandwidths, statistics and signal distributions. For
   this purpose, normalized mean square error has been used to compare the
   model output to measured data when the PA is driven under multi-carrier
   input signals. Measurement results and simulation have been carried out
   and the results demonstrated the effects of the signal characteristics
   on the performances of the model. Multi-carrier wideband code-division
   multiple access and multi-tone signals were used with an experimental
   Doherty amplifier. The obtained results revealed a degradation of the
   polynomial model performances when the statistics of the input signals
   change with similar peak-to-average power ratio.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main challenges in mine detection using sidescan sonar images
   is the high density of mine-like objects (MLOs) in a clutter
   environment. This paper proposes an image change detection technique for
   bitemporal images which suppresses false alarms efficiently without
   involving large training data sets. The proposed approach uses the
   spatial dependence of a stationary object between bitemporal images to
   eliminate the differences caused by a position error. Bayes theory is
   then employed to classify the changed and unchanged objects. In
   particular, the a priori probabilities are formulated by the Markov
   random field (MRF). The likelihood functions are modeled using the
   coarseness difference of objects as the test statistics, and the
   parameters are estimated using the expectation-maximization (EM) method.
   Real sidescan sonar data are used to validate the proposed method.
   Results show that the proposed MRF change detection method is robust to
   the poor quality of object boundaries due to speckle noise, and
   outperforms the conventional pixel-level change detection methods.}},

Abstract = {{Correct orientation of the acetabular cup considering patient-specific
   functional pelvic angles is an important factor for improving outcomes
   and avoiding complications after total hip arthroplasty. This study
   introduces a new, noninvasive radiographic tool for accurately
   determining a patient's specific pelvic tilt angle preoperatively, as
   well as accurately assessing acetabular cup orientation with respect to
   bony landmarks intraoperatively and postoperatively. The method was
   validated by imaging a bone replica model of the pelvis with implanted
   hip components, in comparison to digitized references, and verified with
   a cadaveric specimen. Pelvic tilt was measured with an accuracy of 0.1
   deg and SD of 0.4 deg. Operative cup inclination and anteversion showed
   accuracies of 0.6 deg and 2.5 deg, with SD of 0.4 deg and 0.6 deg,
   respectively; these could be improved further by subtracting systematic
   bias. The method shows accuracy advantages over existing radiographic
   and fluoroscopic methods and exposes the subjects to a lower radiation
   dose compared to the similar computed tomography methods. These results
   suggest that the proposed method is feasible for assessing cup placement
   with reference to the functional and anatomical references. Furthermore,
   the ability to reference the same bony landmarks preoperatively,
   intraoperatively, and postoperatively has important research and
   clinical advantages. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4007664]}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents a framework for categorising and assessing theories
   in land tenure information systems (LTIS) to improve coherence and
   critical rigour in LTIS theory development. The LTIS research area is
   dominated by the land titling theory which holds that land titles
   provide tenure security, which therefore may serve as collateral for
   credit and thus stimulate economic activity. However, this hypothesis is
   not valid in many instances. Alternatives to the land title theory are
   isolated due to the predominance of case study research in the area, the
   small number of researchers focused on LTIS as a research area and the
   difficulty in testing these alternative theories with empirical
   evidence, because many of them are not expressed in a form that renders
   them suitable for testing. In the framework, theories are examined
   according to the context of the situations an LTIS is meant to serve,
   within which the most significant variable is the level of change or
   uncertainty. A taxonomy of theory presented in library information
   science is adapted to assess the level at which a theory may be
   generalised in a particular context type and linked to the framework.
   One way of estimating a theory's level of general applicability is the
   number of times it has been validated empirically in different contexts.
   The framework should serve as a visualisation and analytical tool to
   stimulate the development of a more rigorous theoretical foundation for
   these information systems. The present paper is of primary interest to
   land administration and land information researchers, but it also has
   important implications for practitioners.}},

   focused image and the detection performance are formulated as functions
   of the wall parameters. The target shift is corrected using a waveform
   propagation path estimation method, and the relevant estimation errors
   are analyzed. The two popular UWB modulations, time modulation (TM) and
   spread spectrum (SS), are investigated in these analyses, and their
   robustness to wall parameters is evaluated. Results show that SS is
   preferable to TM for through-the-wall SAR imaging due to its robustness

Abstract = {{The design of a second amplification stage (SAS) for a highly sensitive
   direct-sampling receiver for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) radio
   synthesis telescope is discussed. The SAS is intended to follow a Square
   Kilometre Array low-noise amplifier (SKA-LNA), which is being designed
   by others and is not a subject of this study, to obtain the high gain
   required from the SKA receiver. Due to the SKA ultra-low
   noise-temperature requirements, the SAS noise must be minimized, even
   though it is preceded by an SKA-LNA. The first two stages of the SAS
   consist of an inductorless partially noise-canceling resistive-feedback
   amplifier and a differential gain stage that achieve both low noise
   figures (NFs) and convert the single-ended input signal to a
   differential output. Following this, an additional gain stage is
   cascaded to increase the SAS gain. Over the midband SKA frequency range
   of 0.7-1.4 GHz, a 65-nm CMOS SAS achieves an S-21 > 34 dB, voltage gain
   >36 dB, and sub-1-dB NFs (similar to 75-K noise temperature), P1dB of >
   -52 dBm, input third-order intercept point (IP3) of > -43 dBm and input
   second-order intercept point (IP2) of > -34 dBm, while consuming 96.8 mW
   of dc power. While the proposed SAS is not required to be input power
   matched, a method for matching with minimum effect on NF and gain is
   also presented and experimentally verified. The power match SAS achieves
   S-21 > 26 dB, voltage gain >35 dB, and sub-1.6-dB NFs (similar to 30-K
   noise temperature), input P1dB of > -52 dBm, input IP3 of > -44 dBm, and
   input IP2 of > -34 dBm, while consuming 58.9 mW of dc power.}},

Abstract = {{Ginger rhizomes of different thickness, microwave output power and
   sample load were dehydrated in a modified microwave oven, and effective
   moisture diffusivity was calculated. Among the various basic models
   considered, diffusion equation was most suitable to predict the drying
   behavior for the process conditions. Based on the interpretations, the
   constants and coefficients were rewritten in Arrhenius and logarithmic
   expressions for microwave power. The derived mathematical models were
   validated according to statistical parameters, viz. reduced chi-square,
   root mean square error, mean bias error and t-test values. The modified
   diffusion model explained the suitability of thin layer microwave drying
   behavior of ginger rhizome slices, yielding the highest R2 of 0.9983.
   The effect of microwave drying on extraction of oleoresins with hexane
   as the solvent was in the range of 2.534.55\%. Scanning electron
   microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed enhanced
   integrity of texture and functional groups by microwave treatment.
   PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS Drying, a process of removal of moisture content,
   was carried out on ginger rhizomes. Besides several advantages during
   dehydration, some important changes take place, such as structural and
   physicochemical modifications, which affects the final product quality.
   Microwave heating at specific experimental conditions was aimed at the
   restoration of nutritional and medicinal properties of the raw material.
   Mathematical models applied in this research will be helpful to analyze,
   simulate as well as to design and scale up the microwave drying process
   for industrial and commercial applications. Furthermore, the product may
   have an increased shelf life, finished product quality; may reduced
   energy cost in comparison with the conventionally dried rhizomes; and
   may serve as ingredient for medicinal, pharmaceutical and cosmetics
   industry for the extraction of essential oils such as oleoresins.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main challenges in the phase behavior study of heavy crudes
   such as bitumen and solvent systems is the long equilibration time. The
   equilibration time depends on the experimental conditions, such as
   pressure and temperature, as well as solvent and oil properties. Oil
   viscosity is the key factor for the equilibrium time especially at low
   temperature approaching reservoir condition where the oil viscosity
   (e.g. Athabasca bitumen) is in the order of million centipoises. Thus, a
   method to speed up the phase behavior experiments for heavy crudes is
   essential. The proposed experimental apparatus in our previous study
   {[}7] was modified. The modification speeds up generating the
   experimental data with the capability of conducting parallel
   experiments. Thus, two or three experiments can be conducted at the same
   time period. Total cost for this apparatus is almost the same as our
   pervious apparatus while more experimental data can be produced with
   this new design. In addition to heavy crude/solvent systems, the
   proposed apparatus has the capability of conducting the experiments for
   simple binary systems. The new apparatus was tested for the saturation
   pressure measurement of pure hydrocarbon, the phase behavior study of
   simple binary systems, and the phase behavior study of Athabasca
   bitumen/solvent systems (solvents: methane, ethane, and propane) in the
   case of vapor-liquid and liquid-liquid equilibrium conditions. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Estimates of joint or limb impedance are commonly used in the study of
   how the nervous system controls posture and movement, and how that
   control is altered by injury to the neural or musculoskeletal systems.
   Impedance characterizes the dynamic relationship between an imposed
   perturbation of joint position and the torques generated in response.
   While there are many practical reasons for estimating impedance rather
   than its inverse, admittance, it is an acausal representation of the
   limb mechanics that can lead to difficulties in interpretation or use.
   The purpose of this study was to explore the acausal nature of
   nonparametric estimates of joint impedance representations to determine
   how they are influenced by common experimental and computational
   choices. This was accomplished by deriving discrete-time realizations of
   first and second-order derivatives to illustrate two key difficulties in
   the physical interpretation of impedance impulse response functions.
   These illustrations were provided using both simulated and experimental
   data. It was found that the shape of the impedance impulse response
   depends critically on the selected sampling rate, and on the bandwidth
   and noise characteristics of the position perturbation used during the
   estimation process. These results provide important guidelines for
   designing experiments in which nonparametric estimates of impedance will
   be obtained, especially when those estimates are to be used in a
   multistep identification process.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic thermal rating (DTR) of transmission system facilities is a way
   to maximally realize the equipment capacities while not threatening
   their health. With regards to transmission lines, the allowable current
   of conductors is forecasted based on the environmental situations
   expected in some forthcoming time periods. Due to the fact that weather
   conditions continuously vary, sampling points are very limited against
   many line spans, and the measurements have an inherent error,
   uncertainties must be appropriately included in the DTR determination.
   This paper adopts the fuzzy theory as a strong and simple tool to model
   uncertainties in the DTR calculation. Since DTR intends to determine the
   line capacity for some periods ahead, the capability of fuzzy
   computation in predicting future phenomena is very fruitful here. In the
   proposed model, variables, such as ambient temperature, wind speed, wind
   direction, and solar hour angle are assumed to be fuzzy numbers.
   Numerical simulations are provided based on inputs taken from real
   databases and reasonable assumptions as well. The results obtained
   support the validation and efficiency of the proposed model.}},

Abstract = {{Polarimetric SAR data contains a large amount of potential information
   that may be used to characterize forested scenes. However, the large
   number of PolSAR parameters and discriminators cannot all be used in
   most classification problems. Some form of feature selection will
   improve classification results and improve the efficiency of the system.
   In addition, classification of PolSAR data may be improved with an
   ensemble of classifiers, each tuned to a different class. Our research
   is in the Petawawa experimental forest, in the boreal forest northwest
   of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. We employ Radarsat-2 fine-quad image data
   acquired in August (leaf-on) and November (leaf-off) of 2009. We present
   two system designs in this paper. The first system consists of a feature
   selector based on a non-parametric evaluation function and a support
   vector machine for classification. We demonstrate that the feature
   selection step improves classification accuracy significantly over a
   baseline classifier. We then present a system consisting of an ensemble
   of SVM classifiers, each with its own feature selection component and
   trained on an individual class. The classifier likelihoods are combined
   in a final step. We demonstrate that this system improves classification
   accuracy significantly over a single-classifier system. Finally, we
   demonstrate that classification accuracies are significantly higher when
   leaf-on and leaf-off images are combined over a single season image. (c)

Abstract = {{This paper proposes and analyzes a stabilized multi-level finite volume
   method (FVM) for solving the stationary 3D Navier-Stokes equations by
   using the lowest equal-order finite element pair without relying on any
   solution uniqueness condition. This multi-level stabilized FVM consists
   of solving the nonlinear problem on the coarsest mesh and then
   performing one Newton correction step on each subsequent mesh, thus only
   solving a large linear system. An optimal convergence rate for the
   finite volume approximations of nonsingular solutions is first obtained
   with the same order as that for the usual finite element solution by
   using a relationship between the stabilized FVM and a stabilized finite
   element method. Then the multi-level finite volume approximate solution
   is shown to have a convergence rate of the same order as that of the
   stabilized finite volume solution of the stationary Navier-Stokes
   equations on a fine mesh with an appropriate choice of the mesh size: .
   Finally, numerical results presented validate our theoretical findings.}},

Volume = {{95}},

Abstract = {{Most of the developed models for fractured reservoirs assume ideal
   matrix block size distribution. This assumption may not be valid in
   reality for naturally fractured reservoirs and possibly lead to errors
   in prediction of production from the naturally fractured reservoirs
   especially during a transient period or early time production from the
   matrix blocks. In this study, we investigate the effect of variable
   block size distribution on one- dimensional flow of compressible fluids
   in fractured reservoirs. The effect of different matrix block size
   distributions on the single phase matrix-fracture transfer is studied
   using a recently developed semi-analytical approach. The proposed model
   is able to simulate fluid exchange between matrix and fracture for
   continuous or discrete block size distributions using probability
   density functions or structural information of a fractured formation.
   The presented semi-analytical model demonstrates a good accuracy
   compared to the numerical results. There have been recent attempts to
   consider the effect of variable block size distribution in naturally
   fractured reservoir modeling for slightly compressible fluids with a
   constant viscosity and compressibility. The main objective of this study
   is to consider the effect of variable block size distribution on a
   one-dimensional matrix-fracture transfer function for single-phase flow
   of a compressible fluid in fractured porous media. In the proposed
   semi-analytical model, the pressure variability of viscosity and
   isothermal compressibility is considered by solving the nonlinear
   partial differential equation of compressible fluid flow in the
   fractured media. The closed form solution provided can be applied to
   flow of compressible fluids with variable matrix block size distribution
   in naturally fractured gas reservoirs.}},

Abstract = {{Position of the primary user is significant to the transmission among
   secondary users in cognitive networks (CN). In this paper, orthogonal
   frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based spectrum allocation and
   time of arrival-based localization are proposed for the devised CN.
   Crame-Rao lower bound for range estimation is theoretically derived in
   terms of the proposed spectrum allocation in CN, compared with that of
   the nonoverlapped allocation in CN and OFDM-based static spectrum
   allocation in noncognitive networks (NCN). The 2D localization accuracy
   is investigated based on horizontal dilution of precision (HDOP). The
   theoretical minimum HDOP is explored and the corresponding network
   topology to attain the minimum HDOP is provided. Theoretical analysis
   and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed spectrum allocation
   in CN exhibits a much better ranging and localization accuracy, and a
   better data transmission rate than the nonoverlapped spectrum allocation
   in CN, no matter the designed spectrum with nonoverlapped allocation is
   a sinc function or a rectangle. Also, the proposed spectrum allocation

Abstract = {{Because of its unique properties, such as specific functionality and
   large specific surface area, iron oxide nanoadsorbents had showed
   potential for energy and environmental applications. This work
   investigated the adsorptive removal of different metal ions from
   wastewater by superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoadsorbents (Fe3O4).
   Batch-adsorption technique was employed to assess the kinetic behaviour
   and adsorption equilibrium of cadmium, cobalt and nickel. Accordingly,
   the effect of the following variables on the adsorption reaction was
   tested, namely: solution pH, contact time and temperature. Metal ion
   adsorption was found to be highly pH dependent with a maximum uptake
   achieved around pH 5.5. Kinetic studies showed that adsorption was fast
   and equilibrium was achieved in less than 60?min. The external mass
   transfer kinetic model was applied to the experimental results and
   provided reasonable overall volumetric mass transfer coefficients.
   Adsorption isotherms were determined and appropriately described by the
   Freundlich and Langmuir models, with a better fit to the Freundlich
   model. The amount of metal ion adsorbed increased as the temperature
   increased, suggesting an endothermic adsorption process. The
   thermodynamics studies indicated that the adsorption process was
   spontaneous and endothermic in nature. (c) 2011 Canadian Society for

Abstract = {{The deposition of asphaltene is considered to be one of the most
   difficult problems during oil production. Asphaltene deposition in the
   reservoir is a complex problem; and, due to the depth of reservoirs, it
   is impossible to do field experiments. Thus, to study the effects of
   asphaltene deposition, it is essential to rely on different models that
   are developed for asphaltene adsorption and deposition on the basis of
   the laboratory experimental results. In this manuscript, the focus is on
   the adsorption and deposition of asphaltene in porous media. A new model
   for asphaltene adsorption and deposition in porous media and a
   corresponding numerical method are developed using an implicit scheme. A
   procedure for estimating the asphaltene deposition and adsorption
   parameters is described, and a new optimisation method is introduced.
   This method applies the genetic algorithm to investigate an initial set
   of parameters as an input for the direct search optimisation method. The
   direct search estimates the asphaltene deposition and adsorption
   parameters, which results in an acceptable match with the experimental
   data. To validate the model, both the available experimental data in the
   literature and data from this study are examined with the developed
   model; and, reasonable results are obtained. (C) 2011 Canadian Society

   suitable for electrostatic discharge protection applications. The EMI

   increase in nanofiller concentration. In the 1001500 MHz frequency

Abstract = {{This paper presents an enhanced DC model of a gallium nitride (GaN) high
   electron mobility transistor (HEMT) and the corresponding extraction
   procedure. This proposed model is based on new analytical equations that
   describe the DC behavior of the device, including thermal and trapping
   effects. A new analytical expression of thermal resistance that is
   considered to be temperature dependent is proposed. The trapping effect
   is modeled using an added term in the drain current expression with bias
   dependence. GaN HEMTs fabricated on a silicon wafer and also on a
   silicon carbide wafer are considered to validate the model. The thermal
   and trapping effects are characterized without using the pulsed
   measurement method which usually requires more complex measurements.
   Large-signal measurements are also used to assess further the validity
   of the DC model when it is integrated in and main part of a large-signal
   model used to design an inverse class-F amplifier. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Title = {{Incorporating behavioral-ecological strategies in pattern-oriented

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MODELLING}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus) are classified as threatened in
   Canada, and the Little Smoky herd in west-central Alberta is at
   immediate risk of extirpation due in part, to anthropogenic activities
   such as oil, gas, and forestry that have altered the ecosystem dynamics.
   Winter season represents an especially challenging time of year for this
   Holarctic species as it is characterized by a shortage of basic
   resources and is when most industrial development occurs, to which
   caribou can perceive as increased predation risk. To investigate the
   impact of industrial features on caribou, we developed a spatially
   explicit, agent-based model (ABM) to simulate the underlying behavioral
   mechanisms caribou are most likely to employ when navigating their
   landscape in winter. The ABM model is composed of cognitive caribou
   agents possessing memory and decision-making heuristics that act to
   optimize tradeoffs between energy acquisition and predator/disturbance
   avoidance. A set of environmental data layers was used to develop a
   virtual grid representing the landscape in terms of forage availability,
   energy content, and predation-risk. The model was calibrated with
   caribou bio-energetic values from literature sources, and validated
   using GPS data from thirteen caribou radio-collars deployed over 6
   months from 2004 to 2005. Simulations were conducted on alternative
   caribou habitat-selection strategies by assigning different
   fitness-maximizing goals to agents. The model outcomes were evaluated
   using a pattern-oriented modeling approach with actual caribou data. The
   scenario in which the caribou agent must trade off the mutually
   competing goals of obtaining its daily energy requirement, conserving
   reproductive energy, and minimizing predation risk, was found to be the
   best-fit scenario. Not recognizing industrial features as risk causes
   simulated caribou to unrealistically reduce their daily and landscape
   movements: equally, having risk take precedence results in unrealistic
   energetic deficits and large-scale movement patterns, unlike those
   observed in actual caribou. These results elucidate the most likely
   behavioral strategies caribou use to select their winter habitat, the
   relative extent to which they perceive industry features as potential
   predation, and the differential energetic costs associated with each
   strategy. They can assist future studies of how caribou may respond to
   continued industrial development and/or mitigation measures. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{It has been proposed, based on theoretical considerations, that the
   strain rate-dependent viscoelastic response of cartilage reduces local
   tissue and cell deformations during cyclic compressions. However,
   experimental studies have not addressed the in situ viscoelastic
   response of chondrocytes under static and dynamic loading conditions. In
   particular, results obtained from experimental studies using isolated
   chondrocytes embedded in gel constructs cannot be used to predict the
   intrinsic viscoelastic responses of chondrocytes in situ or in vivo.
   Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the viscoelastic
   response of chondrocytes in their native environment under static and
   cyclic mechanical compression using a novel in situ experimental
   approach. Cartilage matrix and chondrocyte recovery in situ following
   mechanical compressions was highly viscoelastic. The observed in situ
   behavior was consistent with a previous study on in vivo chondrocyte
   mechanics which showed that it took 5-7 min for chondrocytes to recover
   shape and volume following virtually instantaneous cell deformations
   during muscular loading of the knee in live mice. We conclude from these
   results that the viscoelastic properties of cartilage minimize
   chondrocyte deformations during cyclic dynamic loading as occurs, for
   example, in the lower limb joints during locomotion, thereby allowing
   the cells to reach mechanical and metabolic homeostasis even under
   highly dynamic loading conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Carbon formation on conventional Ni/YSZ anodes is a major problem when
   solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) are operated with hydrocarbons. Carbon
   formation reduces the operational stability and lifetime of SOFC. In
   this paper, the influence of the addition of Sn to Ni/YSZ anodes (100
   micron) on the carbon tolerance, electrochemical performance and
   stability of the anodes when operated with CH4 is studied. Sn is
   incorporated into the Ni/YSZ anodes of electrolyte-supported SOFC by
   impregnation (1 and 5 wt\% Sn with respect to Ni). Addition of Sn to
   Ni/YSZ anodes does not reduce the carbon formation when SOFC are
   operated with CH4 at low steam to carbon ratios (< 0.03) and high
   temperatures (1013 and 1073 K). Severe coking and metal dusting occurs
   on Sn-impregnated Ni/YSZ anodes when operated at OCV and 1073 K with dry
   CH4. Addition of higher amounts of Sn (5\%) reduces electrochemical
   performance of Ni/YSZ anodes in H-2 and also reduces the carbon
   gasification rates, leading to higher carbon accumulation. The Sn
   content in the anode decreases after operation at 1073 K for 30 h. Hence
   retaining Sn in the anode might be difficult in actual stack operations
   at high temperatures (1073 K) and long durations (> 40.000 h). (c) 2012

Abstract = {{There has been a rapid evolution of technology used to evaluate
   unconventional gas reservoir and hydraulic-fracture properties, and
   there currently are few standardized procedures to be used as guidance.
   Therefore, more than ever, petroleum engineers and geoscientists are
   required to question data sources and have an intimate knowledge of
   evaluation procedures.
   We propose a workflow for the optimization of unconventional gas
   reservoir (UGR) field development to guide discussion of UGR evaluation.
   Critical issues related to reservoir sample and log analysis,
   rate-transient and production data analysis are raised. Further, we have
   provided illustrations of each step of the reservoir evaluation process
   using tight gas examples. Our intent is to provide some guidance for
   best practices. In addition to reviewing existing methods for reservoir
   evaluation, we introduce new methods for measuring pore size
   distribution (small-angle neutron scattering), evaluating core-scale
   heterogeneity, log-core calibration, and evaluating core/log data trends
   to assist with scale-up of core data. Our focus in this manuscript is on
   tight and shale gas reservoirs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is becoming a significant
   environmental goal and undertaking worldwide, and is expected to be a
   major concern in the future. In this regard, sequestration of CO2 in
   geological formations is of great interest. However, CO2 is buoyant
   under the pressure-temperature conditions of typical geological sites,
   contributing to the risk of leakage. Storage of CO2 as hydrate avoids
   this limitation. Much of the ocean sediments at depths of a few hundred
   meters below the ocean floor provide appropriate conditions for CO2
   hydrate formation. Furthermore, ocean sediments may provide conditions
   at which the density of liquid CO2 is greater than the density of water,
   making liquid CO2 gravitationally stable (i.e., non-buoyant).
   In this study, we investigate storage of CO2 as hydrate below the ocean
   floor. We identify conditions where the initial pressure-temperature
   conditions are suitable for CO2 hydrate formation and demonstrate the
   effect of changes caused by injection. In particular, the changes in
   pressure as a result of injection and the increase in temperature due to
   hydrate formation, both of which could lead to upward movement of CO2,
   are investigated. Sensitivity studies are conducted to determine
   appropriate conditions for large scale CO2 storage. In particular, the
   effects of ocean depth and injection depth in the sediment on flow of
   CO2 toward the ocean floor are studied.
   The results of calculations for static conditions and modeling under
   dynamic conditions show that CO2 hydrate formation and gravitational
   stability of CO2 in the upper parts of the ocean sediments for some
   areas of the ocean can restrict upwards flow of CO2 toward the seabed.
   If the ocean depth and sediment depth for injection of CO2 are properly
   chosen, large volumes of CO2 can be reliably stored in the sediment. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper presents sensitivity analysis results for a distributed
   evolutionary implementation of the estimation of time-dependent
   origin-destination (TDOD) matrices. The system uses a noniterative
   origin-destination (OD) estimation process, which attempts to minimize
   the discrepancy between observed link flow counts and assigned counts.
   At the same time, the system anchors the search process to the vicinity
   of an a priori OD matrix to maintain travel patterns and OD structure.
   The sensitivity analysis examines various factors that are expected to
   affect the performance of the evolutionary-based TDOD estimation method.
   The factors examined are congestion levels, network size, size of the
   search space, and degree of precision of the a priori matrix. Simulation
   results for the waterfront network in Toronto, ON, Canada, show that the
   algorithm is robust in terms of replicating observed vehicle counts and
   the closeness to the real demand. The use of distributed evolutionary
   algorithm is also shown to provide good results for a large network and
   within fast computing speeds. However, the quality of the estimated OD
   relative to the true OD is shown to deteriorate if a totally random a
   priori matrix is used as a starting point, which has no structural
   resemblance to the prevailing OD patterns in the network. In addition,
   the quality of the estimated OD matrix was found to deteriorate as
   congestion levels and the network size increased. It is notable that, in
   all cases, the estimated OD matrix resulted in better matching flows.}},

Abstract = {{Emergent behavior is an important issue in distributed systems' design.
   Detecting and removing emergent behavior during the design phase will
   lead to huge savings in deployment costs of such systems. An effective
   approach for the design of distributed systems is to describe system
   requirements using scenarios. A scenario, commonly known as a message
   sequence chart or a sequence diagram, is a temporal sequence of messages
   sent between system components. However, scenario-based specifications
   are prone to subtle deficiencies with respect to analysis and validation
   known as incompleteness and partial description. In this research, a
   method for detecting emergent behavior of scenario-based specification
   is proposed. The method is demonstrated and verified using a
   mine-sweeping robot as an example. Furthermore it has been demonstrated
   in this paper that scenario-based specifications can be used in agile
   software development and that the proposed methodologies in this
   research can be utilized effectively in agile approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Software defect prediction is an acknowledged approach used to achieve
   better product quality and to better utilize resources needed for that
   purpose. One known method for predicting the number of defects is to
   apply case-based reasoning (CBR). In this paper, different attribute
   weighting techniques for CBR-based defect prediction are analyzed. One
   of the weighting techniques used in this work, Sensitivity Analysis
   based on Neural Networks (SANN), is based on sensitivity analysis of the
   impact of attributes as part of neural network analysis. Neural networks
   are applicable when there are non-linear and complicated relationships
   among the attributes. Since weighting plays a key role in the CBR model,
   using an efficient weight calculation method can change the results. The
   results of SANN are compared with applying uniform weights and weights
   gained from Multiple Linear Regression (MLR).
   Evaluation of the accuracy of the overall method for applying the three
   different weighting techniques is done over five data sets, comprising
   about 5000 modules from NASA. Two quality measures are applied: Average
   Absolute Error (AAE) and Average Relative Error (ARE). In addition to
   the variation of weighting techniques, the impact of varying the number
   of nearest neighbors is studied.
   The three main results of the empirical analysis are: (i) In the
   majority of cases, SANN achieves the most accurate results; (ii) uniform
   weighting performs better than the MLR-based weighting heuristic; and
   (iii) there is no significant preference pattern for defining the number
   of similar objects used for prediction in CBR.}},

Abstract = {{An alternative circuit analysis technique is used to study networks with
   nonsinusoidal sources and linear loads. In contrast to the technique
   developed by Steinmetz, this method is supported by geometric algebra
   instead of the algebra of complex numbers, uses multivectors in place of
   phasors and is performed in the G(N) domain instead of the frequency
   domain. The advantages of this method over the present technique
   involve: determining the flow of current and power quantities in the
   circuit, validating the results using the principle of conservation of
   energy, discerning and revealing other forms of reactive power
   generation, and the ability to design compensators with great
   flexibility. The power equation is composed of the active power and the
   CN-power representing the nonactive power. All the CN-power terms are
   sorted into reactive power terms due to phase shift, reactive power
   terms due to harmonic interactions and degrading power terms which
   determine the new quantity called degrading power. This decomposition
   shows that estimating these quantities is intricate. It also displays
   the power equation's functionality for power factor improvement. The
   geometric addition of power quantities is not pre-established but
   results from applying the established norm and yields the new quantity
   called net apparent power.}},

Title = {{Geomechanical modeling for CO2 storage in Nisku aquifer in Wabamun Lake
   area in Canada}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{10}},
Pages = {{113-122}},

Abstract = {{During CO2 injection, increasing pore pressure and temperature reduction
   create geomechanical deformation of both the reservoir and surrounding
   rocks. One of the most important concerns with respect to the long term
   CO2 storage is that stress changes caused by injection could lead to
   formation fracturing or reactivation of fracture networks and fault
   movements which could potentially provide pathways for CO2 leakage
   through previously impermeable rocks.
   Nisku geological formation located in Wabamun lake area was chosen as
   storage target based on storage capacity, expected ease of injectivity,
   low leakage risks and lack of interference with current petroleum
   production in the area. In order to determine whether the
   injection-induced stress changes affect the viability of this target
   formation to act as an effective storage unit, the geomechanical
   assessment model of the injection process has been developed, which
   couples the thermal flow model and geomechanical model covering all
   layers from the basement to the surface, and incorporates the modeling
   of dynamic injection-induced fracture. This work established the
   methodology for investigating the increase of well injectivity by
   allowing fracturing, and assessing the effect of the injection
   temperature.
   The pressure and stress variations were modeled during and after CO2
   injection utilizing a coupled flow and geomechanical software. Since
   injected CO2's temperature may be considerably lower than the formation
   temperature, thermal effects were incorporated into the models. In order
   to increase the well injectivity, the case of allowing fracture
   initiation and propagation in Nisku was considered. The modeling shows
   that total minimum in situ stress is not constant and can be
   dramatically reduced by injection of cold CO2, thus leading to
   spontaneous fracturing. The cases of isothermal and thermal injection
   (without containment) show that operating above the fracture pressure in
   Nisku will increase the well injectivity (from 1 Mt/year to at least 2
   Mt/year) but creates potentially long fractures and also the possibility
   of fracturing the caprock.
   Decreasing temperature due to CO2 injection will result in stress
   reduction and smaller surface deformations compared to the isothermal
   model. Thermal effects of cold CO2 injection will also reduce the
   fracture (injection) pressure and enhance the horizontal fracture
   propagation through Nisku. However, to make recommendations on a design
   that does not jeopardize isolation capacity of the containment requires
   site specific geomechanical and in situ stress data for all overlaying
   strata, in order to assess the risk of vertical propagation more
   accurately.
   This study predicts that CO2 injection in the Nisku zone is not likely
   to cause any significant surface heave and is not likely to have any
   environmental impact associated with surface deformations.
   In summary, the geomechanical factors put significant constraints on CO2
   storage in Nisku in terms of injection pressures that may be limited by
   fracture propagation, injection rates that can be achieved without
   compromising the seal and excessive fracture propagation, and the CO2
   placement affected by a fracture. The demonstration of the importance of
   thermal effects on CO2 storage is the most important contribution of
   this work. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD), high pressure, high
   temperature steam is injected into a bitumen-bearing oil sands
   formation. For most operations, the steam temperature ranges from about
   200 to 260 degrees C and thus under these conditions, the bitumen
   undergoes hydrous pyrolysis, i.e. aquathermolysis, yielding acid gases
   such as hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide. Current SAGD thermal
   reservoir simulation models often take into account complex spatial
   heterogeneity of the geology and oil composition and the physics of heat
   transfer, multiphase flow, gas solubility effects, and viscosity
   variations with temperature, however, none so far in the literature take
   the detailed chemistry and reaction engineering of bitumen
   aquathermolysis during field scale SAGD into account. Here, we have
   added aquathermolysis reactions to a thermal reservoir simulation model
   to understand the reactive zones in the SAGD process and how the process
   generates acid gases via aquathermolysis. The results reveal that
   chemical reactions have a significant effect on the growth of the SAGD
   steam chamber and that the majority of the reactive zone is in the
   liquid pool that sits above the production well. The product gases of
   aquathermolysis reduce the efficiency of steam heat delivery capacity to
   the chamber edge. The results demonstrate that this effect can be
   reduced by lowering the steam injection pressure. This new model is
   capable of predicting acid gases like hydrogen sulfide, carbon oxides
   and fuel gases like hydrogen, methane as observed during SAGD field
   operations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An architecture and design procedure for transformer- less
   load-modulated power amplifiers (PAs) having high efficiency at power
   back-off is presented. This architecture utilizes a comparable load
   modulation concept as in the Doherty PA; however, contrary to the
   Doherty PA, it neither requires an output impedance transformer, nor
   offset lines, which are the main limiting factors in designing wideband
   Doherty amplifiers. In this architecture, the proper load modulation at
   the transistor drain levels is directly dependant on the design of the
   main and peaking amplifiers' matching networks. It is shown that the
   design of the output impedance of the peaking amplifier as a
   frequency-varying susceptance rather than as a quasi-open circuit
   impedance (as in Doherty amplifiers) helps in achieving better wideband
   performance. Based on the analytical results, a step-by-step procedure
   is proposed for designing wideband load-modulated PAs having high
   efficiency over a wide power back-off region. Based on the proposed
   architecture and its design procedure, a 10-W PA is designed and
   prototyped in the 1.96-2.46-GHz band exhibiting a power-added efficiency
   of more than 40\% at a 6-dB power back-off. In comparison with a
   symmetrical Doherty amplifier design using the same device, the proposed
   architecture exhibits a 250\% enhancement in its fractional bandwidth.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new method for extending the bandwidth of Doherty
   power amplifiers (PAs) in the digital domain. The bandwidth enhancement
   is achieved through a frequency-selective pre-compensation mechanism
   that is derived to prevent the efficiency degradation that naturally
   occurs as the frequency of operation deviates from the center frequency.
   A methodical analysis of the frequency response of the conventional
   Doherty PA and that of the proposed Doherty PA is carried out to point
   out the limitations of the former and demonstrate the capability of the
   latter in recovering the bandwidth. Over the frequency range spanning
   from 1.96 to 2.46 GHz, the measured drain efficiency at 6-7-dB output
   power back-off is higher than 40\% for the proposed Doherty PA. Such
   efficiency performance is achievable only from 2.04 to 2.22 GHz using
   the conventional Doherty PA. Hence, the bandwidth is enhanced from 180
   to 500 MHz, which corresponds to an increase by a factor of 2.8 (i.e.,
   almost triple). By applying the proposed methodology, a Doherty PA that
   is originally designed at the center frequency of 2.14 GHz for downlink
   wideband code division multiple access became operative at 1.98-GHz
   uplink wideband code division multiple access (UL-WCDMA), 2.22-GHz
   long-term evolution (LTE), and 2.34-GHz worldwide interoperability for
   microwave access (WiMAX) bands. The average drain efficiencies for
   UL-WCDMA, LTE, and WiMAX applications, were 40.1\%, 44.2\%, and 41.4\%,
   respectively, using the proposed Doherty PA, and 37\%, 37.3\%, and
   35.2\%, respectively, using the conventional Doherty PA.}},

   From this perspective, solar powered cooling systems as a green cold

   is a mature technology that has proved its applicability with the
   possibility to be driven by low grade solar and waste heat. In this

   doi:10.1152/ajpheart.00261.2012.-Electrical communication and its role
   in blood flow regulation are built on an examination of charge movement
   in single, isolated vessels. How this process behaves in broader
   arterial networks remains unclear. This study examined the nature of
   electrical communication in arterial structures where vessel length and
   branching were varied. Analysis began with the deployment of an existing
   computational model expanded to form a variable range of vessel
   structures. Initial simulations revealed that focal endothelial
   stimulation generated electrical responses that conducted robustly along
   short unbranched vessels and to a lesser degree lengthened arteries or
   branching structures retaining a single branch point. These predictions
   matched functional observations from hamster mesenteric arteries and
   support the idea that an increased number of vascular cells attenuate
   conduction by augmenting electrical load. Expanding the virtual network
   to 31 branches revealed that electrical responses increasingly ascended
   from fifth- to first-order arteries when the number of stimulated distal
   vessels rose. This property enabled the vascular network to grade
   vasodilation and network perfusion as revealed through blood flow
   modeling. An elevation in endothelial-endothelial coupling resistance,
   akin to those in sepsis models, compromised this ascension of
   vasomotor/perfusion responses. A comparable change was not observed when
   the endothelium was focally disrupted to mimic disease states including
   atherosclerosis. In closing, this study highlights that vessel length
   and branching play a role in setting the conduction of electrical
   phenomenon along resistance arteries and within networks. It also
   emphasizes that modest changes in endothelial function can, under
   certain scenarios, impinge on network responsiveness and blood flow
   control.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed an injection well design to reduce the cost of CO2
   sequestration. In this design, we propose a reverse gas-lift technology
   for simultaneous injection of CO2 and water into aquifers. Saline water,
   which is produced at a location distant from the storage site, is pumped
   into a well through tubing; CO2 is injected using the annular space
   between the tubing and the casing. One way gas-lift valves installed
   along the tubing allow the flow of CO2 from the annulus into the tubing.
   This design makes the injection achievable at lower wellhead pressures,
   thereby, decreasing the compression costs. Simulation results
   demonstrate that the compression cost is lower than when a conventional
   injection scheme is used. The results also reveal that the proposed
   design can decrease the energy consumption for CO2 sequestration. These
   results have implications for the large-scale implementation of CO2

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CANADIAN PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{The commercial viability of the steam-assisted gravity-drainage (SAGD)
   process is affected negatively by several undesirable reservoir
   features, such as pronounced heterogeneity, low vertical permeability,
   thick and areally extensive shale barriers, and steam thief zones. The
   efficiency of SAGD projects is also affected by the presence of higher
   water saturation in the target zone. Although the presence of small
   mobile-water saturation is not considered harmful, reservoirs with high
   water saturation may be poorly suited for the SAGD process. Nonetheless,
   SAGD remains the only practical technology for in-situ extraction of oil
   from oil-sand reservoirs, even when mobile water is present. This raises
   the question of how much mobile water is prohibitive.
   To investigate the effect of water saturation on SAGD performance,
   high-pressure physical-model experiments were carried out. Different
   levels of water saturations were established in the model by modifying
   the packing and saturating techniques. SAGD experiments were carried out
   by injecting superheated steam at controlled rates and producing the oil
   from the production well at constant pressure. The injection rate was
   selected to keep the pressure difference between the injector and the
   producer at a low level.
   The oil-production behavior was analyzed to evaluate the effect of water
   saturation on the thermal efficiency of the process. On the basis of the
   results of low- (immobile) and high- (mobile) water-saturation
   experiments, it was observed that the oil-recovery factor dropped by
   6.6\% when the initial water saturation was increased from 14.7\% to
   31.8\%.}},

Abstract = {{The vapor liquid equilibrium (VLE) data for ternary systems (methane +
   decane + hexadecane) have been determined using a designed pressure
   volume temperature (PVT) apparatus. Three different (decane +
   hexadecane) binary mixtures were prepared, and the solubility and phase
   equilibria of three prepared mixtures with methane at ambient
   temperature and different pressures from (1 to 8) MPa were studied. The
   phase composition and saturated liquid density and viscosity were
   reported for each pressure. The VLE data of the ternary mixtures were
   correlated using Soave-Redlich-Kwong and Peng-Robinson equations of
   state. The equations of state models with their best-fitted parameters
   of the binary systems, (methane + decane and methane + hexadecane), were
   used to predict the VLE data of ternary systems. Both equations of state
   were found to be capable of describing the phase equilibria of binary
   pairs and ternary systems over the range of studied conditions. The
   Peng-Robinson equation of state gave better predictions of saturated
   liquid densities than those of the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of
   state.}},

Abstract = {{Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) consist of accelerometers, gyroscopes
   and a processor that generates position and orientation solutions by
   integrating the specific forces and rotation rates. In addition to the
   accelerometers and gyroscopes, magnetometers can be used to derive the
   user heading based on Earth's magnetic field. Unfortunately, the
   measurements of the magnetic field obtained with low cost sensors are
   usually corrupted by several errors, including manufacturing defects and
   external electro-magnetic fields. Consequently, proper calibration of
   the magnetometer is required to achieve high accuracy heading
   measurements. In this paper, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based
   calibration algorithm is presented to estimate the values of the bias
   and scale factor of low cost magnetometers. The main advantage of this
   technique is the use of the artificial intelligence which does not need
   any error modeling or awareness of the nonlinearity. Furthermore, the
   proposed algorithm can help in the development of Pedestrian Navigation
   Devices (PNDs) when combined with inertial sensors and GPS/Wi-Fi for
   indoor navigation and Location Based Services (LBS) applications.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Full steam conformance along the well pair of the steam-assisted
   gravity-drainage (SAGD) oil-sands-recovery process is essential for high
   thermal efficiency. Conformance can be improved by controlling injection
   and production strategies to ensure that steam is delivered to target
   regions in the reservoir. Smart wells use interval-control valves (ICVs)
   that, conceptually, can be dynamically controlled to yield uniform steam
   injectivity along the well pair. Dynamic control algorithms, such as
   proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control and their associated
   controller parameters, have not yet been developed for the SAGD
   processes that use ICVs. One control strategy would be to control the
   interwell subcool temperature difference-that is, the difference between
   the steam-injection temperature and the produced-fluids temperature. If
   this temperature difference is small, then the liquid pool above the
   production well is small and there is a likelihood of live steam
   production from the chamber. On the other hand, if the difference is
   large, the pool may rise above the injection well and gravity drainage
   is hindered because the chamber is largely filled with liquid. Here, the
   focus is on developing a simple, approximate theory for the behavior of
   the liquid pool at the base of the steam chamber to determine the ranges
   of values of control parameters to achieve a targeted interwell subcool
   temperature difference.}},

Journal = {{SPE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) is a commercially viable recovery
   method for oil sands of Athabasca used where other methods have been
   unsuccessful. In one variation of SAGD, a small amount of a
   noncondensable gas is added to the injected steam to maintain pressure
   in the chamber while using the energy in place, reducing steam
   consumption and providing thermal insulation from overburden heat
   losses. The role of gas during steam-gas co-injection processes, in
   terms of its effects on chamber development, bitumen flow rates, and
   heat losses, is not fully understood, and therefore is the main focus of
   this work.
   A new analytical model for gas injection in SAGD is derived, taking into
   account the three-phase flow of gas, oil, and water in the reservoir.
   The analytical theory is used to predict the fluid flow rates as well as
   phase mobility, relative permeability, and saturation profiles in the
   mobile oil region. The theoretical results are replicated by fine-grid
   numerical simulations. Methane was used as the noncondensable gas for
   the purpose of this study because it is the main solution gas in most
   reservoirs. It is, however, believed that the findings of this study are
   equally applicable to other noncondensable gases such as nitrogen, air,
   helium, and others. Fine-grid numerical simulations were performed to
   gain a visual understanding of gas distribution in a SAGD chamber and
   its effect on in-situ steam quality, overburden heat losses, phase
   saturations, and fluid-flow rates. The simulation results support the
   predictions of the mathematical theory.
   The results of the analytical and numerical study reveal that methane
   co-injection with steam is in general unfavorable in a SAGD operation.
   The injected methane tends to accumulate at the steam condensation
   front, which lowers the heat transfer rate of steam to the adjacent oil,
   resulting in lower oil production rates and slower growth of the
   chamber.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of joint design of routing, medium
   access control (MAC), and physical layer protocols with cooperative
   communication to achieve minimum power cost in packet error rate (PER)
   constrained wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The problem is solved in
   two steps. First, we calculate the minimum power cost with a specified
   PER objective between any two nodes, assuming either cooperative (with a
   single relay node) or direct communication between the two nodes. It is
   shown that the minimum per-hop power cost is found in 2M and log(2)M
   steps for cooperative and direct communication, respectively, where M is
   the number of power levels. Second, we formulate the cross-layer design
   problem as a linear optimization problem to minimize the power cost of
   the whole network, using the minimum per-hop power cost determined in
   the first step as input and assuming time division multiple access
   (TDMA) at the MAC layer. Numerical results show that, at a desired
   end-to-end PER objective, cross-layer optimization with cooperative
   communication achieves up to 70\% of power savings compared to that
   without cooperative communication. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by

Abstract = {{In this paper, two epoch-by-epoch robust positioning techniques for
   global positioning system (GPS) are proposed to deal with the problem of
   positioning in weak signal conditions in which the probability of
   outlier in signal acquisition is larger than zero. We propose to accept
   outliers into the positioning algorithm, however, in this case either
   robust estimation or outlier detection must be used to overcome the
   devastating effect of such outliers on traditional positioning
   algorithms. In order to improve the sensitivity of a GPS receiver, we
   propose to use novel methods that are able to deal with the problem of

Abstract = {{Time-based localization of a mobile station (MS) in a cellular network
   is usually performed by utilizing a pseudonoise transmission and a range
   difference-based positioning protocol. In this paper, we propose a novel
   positioning system using multicarrier transmission for orthogonal
   frequency division multiplexing-based cellular networks. For this
   system, a novel localization protocol is presented in which we propose
   four possible positioning methods to be analyzed and compared in
   conjunction with the novel protocol. Toward this goal, a unified
   CrameRao lower bound (CRLB) is derived theoretically for all four
   methods. We also use best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE)based
   algorithms to implement the proposed methods when locating a MS using
   cellular base stations. Their performance is discussed and compared in
   terms of the positioning error covariance matrix (PECM). Theoretical
   analysis is provided in the paper which demonstrates that BLUE-based
   location methods can approach the CRLB asymptotically under some
   conditions and that our positioning protocol has a better localization
   accuracy than either a range-based positioning protocol or a range
   difference-based one with respect to PECM. Finally, this paper verifies
   its theoretical findings by simulation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel tracking algorithm that combines
   complementary tracking modules with a new object representation model to
   balance between stability and adaptivity. To reduce the update error of
   online tracking, we present three complementary modules (a stable
   module, a soft stable module, and an adaptive module) and fuse them by
   using a biased multiplicative criterion. The combination of those
   modules not only facilitates the accurate location of the tracked object
   but also makes our tracker adaptive to appearance change. For objection
   representation, we present an appearance model named pixel-wise spatial
   pyramid (PSP), which employs pixel feature vector to combine several
   pixel characteristics. During the updating process, we update the
   codebook by using the reserved pixel feature vectors that are selected
   by a distance-based scheme. Then, we generate an evolving target
   representation by using a hybrid feature map that consists of the
   reserved pixel vectors and antipart of the previous hybrid feature map.
   Numerous experiments on various challenging image sequences demonstrate
   that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against several
   state-of-the-art algorithms, especially for drastic appearance change.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a feedforward Hammerstein structure that is proposed
   for the modeling and digital predistortion of the dynamic nonlinear
   behavior of the wideband radio frequency power amplifiers and wireless

   cancellation loop and the second used as distortion injection loop. The
   main signal cancellation loop is responsible for the characterizing of
   the PA dynamics through a Hammerstein model. Indeed, the distortion
   injection loop was found to complement the main signal cancellation loop
   by adding an accurate means of modeling the nonlinear dynamics of the
   intermodulation distorted signal for the better mimicking of the
   intermodulation distortion products especially in the out-of-band
   regions. Its accuracy is assessed in behavioral modeling and digital
   predistortion, by comparing it to other state-of-the-art models. The
   measurement results show an adjacent channel power ratio of almost -50

Abstract = {{Geochemical modeling based on equilibrium thermodynamics has become a
   recognized tool for understanding water-rock interaction processes and
   mechanisms. However, for the last 40 years, little attention has been
   given to the interaction of water-rock-gas systems or
   water-rock-gas-petroleum systems, possibly due to the complexity of the
   equilibrium calculations. The program described here is particularly
   useful for modeling geochemical interactions in oil and gas reservoirs,
   where brines and minerals are just some of the phases present, together
   with gases, and petroleum liquids, or other liquid phases. It all seems
   that, through a global minimization procedure, the equilibrium state of
   all the components (or pseudo-components) present in a hydrocarbon
   charged reservoir can be easily calculated at any pressure and
   temperature, by combining classical fluid phase equilibrium concepts,
   electrolyte theory, and solid-liquid equilibrium theory. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{This paper studies the setting in which a one-of-a-kind production (OKP)
   firm offers two types of orders (due-date guaranteed and due-date
   unguaranteed) at different prices to the sequentially arriving
   customers, who are also OKP production firms. The prices for two types
   of orders are quoted to each customer on its arrival. We study two
   problems in this setting. First, we model a dynamic pricing strategy
   (DPS) and compare our DPS with a constant pricing strategy (CPS).
   Through a numerical test, we show that both the firm and its customers
   are better off when our DPS is employed, so that the DPS improves
   overall performance of the supply chain. Through an industry case, a
   custom window production firm, we show how to apply the proposed DPS
   when products are complex. We also develop a method to adaptively
   estimate the firm's available capacity, the number of future arrivals
   and the distributions of the customers' willingness to pay and
   impatience factor. The simulation result shows that, when multiple
   distribution parameters are unknown, the proposed parameter estimating
   method results in estimates close to the true values. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Experimental findings indicate that in-situ chondrocytes die readily
   following impact loading, but remain essentially unaffected at low
   (non-impact) strain rates. This study was aimed at identifying possible
   causes for cell death in impact loading by quantifying chondrocyte
   mechanics when cartilage was subjected to a 5\% nominal tissue strain at
   different strain rates. Multi-scale modelling techniques were used to
   simulate cartilage tissue and the corresponding chondrocytes residing in
   the tissue. Chondrocytes were modelled by accounting for the cell
   membrane, pericellular matrix and pericellular capsule. The results
   suggest that cell deformations, cell fluid pressures and fluid flow
   velocity through cells are highest at the highest (impact) strain rate,
   but they do not reach damaging levels. Tangential strain rates of the
   cell membrane were highest at the highest strain rate and were observed
   primarily in superficial tissue cells. Since cell death following impact
   loading occurs primarily in superficial zone cells, we speculate that
   cell death in impact loading is caused by the high tangential strain
   rates in the membrane of superficial zone cells causing membrane rupture
   and loss of cell content and integrity.}},

Abstract = {{Scoliosis causes an abnormal three dimensional curvature of the spine

   of this research was to develop a new approach to automatically identify

   evaluations. In this approach, torso geometry of the scoliosis patient
   was achieved using a 3-D imaging system that generated a 3-D torso
   surface model, which was modified using a custom CAD system to design
   the 3-D brace surface model. Two design parameters, a translational
   correction factor and a rotational correction factor, were selected to
   design the brace geometry from the torso geometry. The 3-D digital brace
   was evaluated by three clinical evaluation measures (imbalance, rib hump
   and principal axis angle reduction) and one patient evaluation measure
   (discomfort). A multi-objective optimization method was employed to
   identify the optimal design parameters considering both clinical and
   patient evaluations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{NAVIGATION-JOURNAL OF THE INSTITUTE OF NAVIGATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{209-220}},

Abstract = {{Antenna array processing techniques require calibration algorithms that
   often rely on the availability of signal sources at known locations, a
   good knowledge of the array manifold, or a reference antenna. An
   alternative is provided by GNSS signals that provide the location of
   their sources as part of their navigation data. In this paper, a
   projection methodology using GNSS signals is proposed for the
   calibration of antenna arrays. The Gram Schmidt process is used along
   with the properties of the signal steering vectors to determine linear
   relationships between the recovered signals and the calibration
   parameters. The obtained system of equations is then solved in the
   Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) sense leading to the estimated
   calibration parameters. The proposed algorithm accounts for signal
   gain/phase mismatches and mutual coupling between array elements.
   Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed technique and its suitability
   for beamforming and Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) applications is supported
   by several experiments performed using live GPS signals and a GNSS
   software receiver. Copyright (C) 2012 Institute of Navigation.}},

Abstract = {{Externally bonded Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) strips have
   been used for strengthening reinforced concrete structures. This paper
   presents an experimental study on the debonding of externally bonded
   CFRP strips anchored to a concrete substrate by a commercial epoxy
   adhesive. The study represents the basis for the characterization of an
   innovative `gradient method', giving the possibility to anchor
   prestressed CFRP strips to concrete without the use any mechanical
   anchorage systems such as plates and bolts. Bond between the two
   components is achieved by an epoxy adhesive able to carry loads after an
   accelerated curing process under elevated temperatures. The effect of
   heating configuration/duration, strip thickness and bond length on the
   temporary bond resistance have been investigated using prestressed and
   non-prestressed CFRP-strips. Besides the optimization of the heating
   elements necessary for the curing process, curing parameters for an
   optimal temporary bond strength could be determined. Twenty-five minutes
   of heating and curing at 90 degrees C was found to be an optimum heating
   configuration, resulting in better short-term mechanical performances
   than after conventional curing at room temperature for several days. The
   main reason is a temporarily softer adhesive which allows the use of the
   full bond length by reducing shear force peaks. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Using a three-dimensional (3D) modality to image patients' knees before

   clinicians to evaluate causes of pain after TKA, differences in implant
   design, and changes ill the articular geometry as a result of surgery.
   Computed tomography (CT) has not been fully utilized to date for
   evaluating the knee after TKA due to metal artifacts obscuring part of
   the image. We describe an accurate, validated protocol, which has been
   implemented in vivo, that improves visibility of the patellofemoral
   joint, matches implant models automatically in 3D, segments preoperative
   bone semi-automatically, detects and sets coordinate systems
   automatically, determines the six degrees of freedom of knee pose and
   geometry, and allows for multiple other measurements that are clinically
   relevant. Subjects are imaged at 0 degrees and 30 degrees knee flexion,
   while pushing on a custom-made knee rig to provide partial loadbearing.
   With some modifications, the protocol can be adopted by any group with
   access to a CT scanner and image analysis software, allowing for the
   investigation of numerous clinical and biomechanical questions. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{AIM: To investigate the performance of a new software-based colonoscopy
   quality assessment system.
   METHODS: The software-based system employs a novel image processing
   algorithm which detects the levels of image clarity, withdrawal
   velocity, and level of the bowel preparation in a real-time fashion from
   live video signal. Threshold levels of image blurriness and the
   withdrawal velocity below which the visualization could be considered
   adequate have initially been determined arbitrarily by review of sample
   colonoscopy videos by two experienced endoscopists. Subsequently, an
   overall colonoscopy quality rating was computed based on the percentage
   of the withdrawal time with adequate visualization (scored 1-5; 1, when
   the percentage was 1\%-20\%; 2, when the percentage was 21\%-40\%,
   etc.). In order to test the proposed velocity and blurriness thresholds,
   screening colonoscopy withdrawal videos from a specialized ambulatory
   colon cancer screening center were collected, automatically processed
   and rated. Quality ratings on the withdrawal were compared to the
   insertion in the same patients. Then, 3 experienced endoscopists
   reviewed the collected videos in a blinded fashion and rated the overall
   quality of each withdrawal (scored 1-5; 1, poor; 3, average; 5,
   excellent) based on 3 major aspects: image quality, colon preparation,
   and withdrawal velocity. The automated quality ratings were compared to
   the averaged endoscopist quality ratings using Spearman correlation
   coefficient.
   RESULTS: Fourteen screening colonoscopies were assessed. Adenomatous
   polyps were detected in 4/14 (29\%) of the collected colonoscopy video
   samples. As a proof of concept, the Colometer software rated colonoscope
   withdrawal as having better visualization than the insertion in the 10
   videos which did not have any polyps (average percent time with adequate
   visualization: 79\% +/- 5\% for withdrawal and 50\% +/- 14\% for
   insertion, P < 0.01). Withdrawal times during which no polyps were
   removed ranged from 4-12 min. The median quality rating from the
   automated system and the reviewers was 3.45 {[}interquartile range
   (IQR), 3.1-3.68] and 3.00 (IQR, 2.33-3.67) respectively for all
   colonoscopy video samples. The automated rating revealed a strong
   correlation with the reviewer's rating (rho coefficient = 0.65, P =
   0.01). There was good correlation of the automated overall quality
   rating and the mean endoscopist withdrawal speed rating (Spearman r
   coefficient= 0.59, P = 0.03): There was no correlation of automated
   overall quality rating with mean endoscopists image quality rating
   (Spearman r coefficient= 0.41, P = 0.15).
   CONCLUSION: The results from a novel automated real-time colonoscopy
   quality feedback system strongly agreed with the endoscopists' quality
   assessments. Further study is required to validate this approach. (c)

Journal = {{BIOCHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{140-147}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{This study revealed a dual effect of copper on D. squalens laccase
   activity, inducing and suppressing. The addition of copper sulfate led
   to enhancement of the enzyme activity until it reached a maximum value
   at peak copper sulfate concentration (PC) followed by suppression and
   even complete termination of the enzyme activity. Maximum laccase yield
   is a function of fungi tolerance and media composition. Nutrients had a
   significant impact on copper-independent and copper-induced laccase
   activity. Some nutrients also improved tolerance of cells and
   laccase-producing system to copper load. The effect of specific nutrient
   depended on the ratio of carbon and nitrogen sources. This research can
   be used to predict the effective copper concentration and nutrient
   composition to stimulate the laccase production without compromising the
   fungi growth. The methylated substrates (3-O-methylglucose,
   methylcellulose) in combination with casein and copper demonstrated high
   potential to support fungi tolerance and enhanced laccase activity. (C)

Abstract = {{The paper analysis the incorporation of the source term in the
   advection-diffusion equation for the BGK Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM).
   The problem is the coupled energy and species conservation equations
   with the Soret term. The problem is extremely important for people using
   LBM in simulating multi-physics, because multi-physics effect added as a
   source term to LB. A Few BGK LBM models were used, namely D1Q2, D1Q3,
   D2Q4 and D2Q5 to solve advection-diffusion-reaction problems. The aim of
   this work is to demonstrate that the lattice Boltzmann method is able to
   simulate Soret effect, where the source term is the curvature of the
   temperature field. Theoretical analysis of the force inclusion is also
   presented in the paper. To insure that the predictions are correct and
   consistent with the traditional methods, comparison of LBM predictions
   with the finite difference method (FVM) predictions were illustrated.
   Also, the results show that prediction of D1Q2 may suffer from
   oscillation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new solution method, which is an improved version of
   bacterial foraging (BF) technique, is proposed for optimal power flow
   with security constraints (OPF-SC) problem. The OPF-SC is a nonlinear
   programming optimization problem with complex discontinuous solution
   space. BF is a recently developed advanced stochastic search technique
   owning high exploitation and local search capabilities to search the
   promising areas of the solution space with high resolution. Saving the
   advantages of BF, the exploration capability and diversity of the search
   process of BF are enhanced in the proposed improved version of BF (IBF)
   to cover different areas of the solution space avoiding being trapped in
   local minima. The effectiveness of the suggested solution strategy to
   solve the OPF-SC problem is extensively illustrated on some well-known
   test systems. Moreover, the proposed IBF is compared with many recently

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates a new channel-selective multi-cell processing
   predistortion technique that compensates for the nonlinearities of
   multi-carrier transmitters. The proposed technique uses independent
   processing cells to compensate for the intra-band and inter-band
   distortions of nonlinear transmitters. This frequency-selective feature
   of the proposed technique significantly reduces the minimum sampling
   rate requirements of analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters,
   which are a critical issue for conventional digital predistortion (DPD)
   techniques dealing with wideband signals. The proposed technique was
   evaluated with four-carrier (1001) and six-carrier (100001) WCDMA
   signals, using a nonlinear 10-Watt power amplifier. The performance of
   the proposed technique was compared with look-up table, multi-branch and
   recently proposed frequency-selective DPDs, in terms of adjacent-channel
   power ratios (ACPRs) and sampling rate requirements. The proposed
   technique improved the ACPR and the carrier-to-intermodulation power
   ratio (CIMPR) of the 1001 WCDMA signal by more than 13 dB and 10 dB,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{A variable-volume reactor was used for measuring the solid-vapor-liquid
   equilibrium conditions of semiclathrates formed in an aqueous solution
   of tetra-iso-amyl ammonium bromide (TiAAB). The TiAAB semiclathrates
   were formed from pure CO2, pure N-2, and three mixtures of CO2 (1) + N-2
   (2), which had cylinder compositions of x(1) = 0.78, x(1) = 0.52, and
   x(1) = 0.21. The experimental temperatures ranged from (302 to 307) K,
   the experimental pressures ranged from (220 to 2115) kPa, and the
   concentration of TiAAB in solution was constant at a mass fraction of
   W-TiAAB = 0.1403. For all of the gases used in the present study, it was
   found that, at a given pressure, the minimum temperature required to
   form TiAAB semiclathrates is significantly higher than that required for
   forming both gas hydrates or tetrabutyl ammonium bromide (TBAB)
   semiclathrates from the same gases.}},

Abstract = {{The decline in conventional hydrocarbon resources coupled with the
   increase in energy demand has encouraged the development of
   unconventional gas resources. One specific type of unconventional gas is
   the natural-gas hydrate. It is expected that the substantial size of
   this hydrate resource will be a motivating factor in its development. In
   the early phases of development of hydrate reservoirs, data are limited
   and a large number of sensitivity studies are required. Efficient and
   accurate analytical models are suitable for such sensitivity studies.
   One such model is presented in this work.
   An analytical solution is developed to model the rate of gas generation
   and hydrate recovery when gas is produced from a tilted hydrate-capped
   gas reservoir in which the geothermal gradient is accounted for. As a
   result of the variation in temperature within the hydrate column, the
   size of the decomposing area increases with continued production.
   Development of the analytical model in this work is based on a
   material-balance equation that is combined with the solution for the
   temperature of the decomposed zone and the hydrate-equilibrium curve.
   The three equations are solved simultaneously for the gas-generation
   rate. To validate the assumptions made in the development of the
   analytical model, a numerical simulator was used that does not make the
   assumptions of the analytical model. A close agreement is shown between
   the two models, validating the assumptions made in the analytical
   solution. The effects of different reservoir parameters on the reservoir
   performance were investigated by performing sensitivity analyses. The
   sensitivity results show how a steeper reservoir that extends closer to
   the base of the permafrost leads to less recovery or how a thicker
   hydrate cap could maintain the reservoir pressure for a longer time.
   The model developed in this study can be used as an approximate
   engineering tool to evaluate the role of hydrates in improving the
   productivity and extending the life of tilted hydrate-capped gas
   reservoirs.}},

Abstract = {{Interstitial water in a water-wet bitumen reservoir can form a
   continuous water network, which allows reservoir water to flow
   throughout the reservoir. A primary objective of the paper was to
   develop an experimental method to measure the water effective
   permeability of the continuous water network in an unconventional
   oil-water system. In experiments, semi-permeable membranes were
   installed at the production end of sandpacks to create a stationary oil
   phase condition. Experimental results showed that the water phase could
   flow under low permeability at initial water saturations. A cylindrical
   capillary tube model was developed to analyze experimental results and
   it showed that different wetting film thicknesses inside a porous medium
   could alter the overall effective permeability under the same initial
   water saturation. In the case study, different reservoir simulation
   operations were performed to compare influences of initial water
   movement. It was concluded that, under a small amount of initial water
   movement across the boundary, the pressure profiles and flow patterns of
   reservoir water changed. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   discussed the first part of the pore-scale mechanisms and events, which

   pore-scale displacement events and the interactions between oleic phase,
   aqueous surfactant solution, and connate water film in pore networks
   with different pore throat sizes. Furthermore, some implications for the
   pore-scale network modeling of this type of flow are discussed. Finally,

Abstract = {{Modern ``smart{''} CMOS sensors have penetrated into various
   applications, such as surveillance systems, bio-medical applications,
   digital cameras, cellular phones and many others. Reducing the power of
   these sensors continuously challenges designers. In this paper, a low
   power global shutter CMOS image sensor with Wide Dynamic Range (WDR)
   ability is presented. This sensor features several power reduction
   techniques, including a dual voltage supply, a selective power down,
   transistors with different threshold voltages, a non-rationed logic, and
   a low voltage static memory. A combination of all these approaches has
   enabled the design of the low voltage ``smart{''} image sensor, which is
   capable of reaching a remarkable dynamic range, while consuming very low
   power. The proposed power-saving solutions have allowed the maintenance
   of the standard architecture of the sensor, reducing both the time and
   the cost of the design. In order to maintain the image quality, a
   relation between the sensor performance and power has been analyzed and
   a mathematical model, describing the sensor Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR)
   and Dynamic Range (DR) as a function of the power supplies, is proposed.
   The described sensor was implemented in a 0.18 um CMOS process and
   successfully tested in the laboratory. An SNR of 48 dB and DR of 96 dB
   were achieved with a power dissipation of 4.5 nW per pixel.}},

Abstract = {{The characteristics of the slot-and perturbed TE10 modes in a slitted

   as modifications are made to the structure. Two structures are
   presented, the first suppressing the propagation of the slot-mode, and
   the second suppressing the radiation of the slot-mode. Experimental
   validation is presented supporting the numerical results. It will be
   shown that a wideband suppression of the slot-mode propagation is
   achievable. However, there is a significant impact on the propagation
   characteristics of the desired perturbed TE10 mode. Conversely, the
   suppression of the slot-mode radiation is achievable with minimal impact

Abstract = {{Synthesis of the optimum distillation column sequence (DCS), which

   total annual cost (TAC) is the main criterion used to screen
   alternatives. Efficient procedure has been proposed for encoding
   mechanism to include and classify various complex arrangements together
   with conventional distillation columns. All columns existing in each DCS
   alternative are designed using the most recommended short-cut methods to
   estimate the TAC of the DCS. Four standard benchmark case studies are
   carried out to clearly demonstrate the excellent performance of the
   proposed method. The produced results for these problems indicate that

Abstract = {{It is often difficult, if not impossible, to measure the aerodynamic or
   hydrodynamic forces on a moving body. For this reason, a classical
   control-volume technique is typically applied to extract the unsteady
   forces. However, measuring the acceleration term within the volume of
   interest using particle image velocimetry (PIV) can be limited by
   optical access, reflections, as well as shadows. Therefore, in this
   study, an alternative approach, termed the derivative-moment
   transformation (DMT) method, is introduced and tested on a synthetic
   data set produced using numerical simulations. The test case involves
   the unsteady loading of a flat plate in a two-dimensional, laminar
   periodic gust. The results suggest that the DMT method can accurately
   predict the acceleration term so long as appropriate spatial and
   temporal resolutions are maintained. The major deficiency, which is more
   dominant for the direction of drag, was found to be the determination of
   pressure and unsteady terms in the wake. The effect of control-volume
   size was investigated, suggesting that larger domains work best by
   minimizing the associated error in the determination of the pressure
   field. When decreasing the control-volume size, wake vortices, which
   produce high gradients across the control surfaces, are found to
   substantially increase the level of error. On the other hand, it was
   shown that for large control volumes, and with realistic spatial
   resolution, the accuracy of the DMT method would also suffer. Therefore,
   a delicate compromise is required when selecting control-volume size in
   future experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Iron-oxide nanoadsorbents are attractive for wastewater treatment for
   two important reasons. First, nanoadsorbents can remove contaminants
   from wastewater rapidly. Second, iron oxide nanoadsorbents can be
   employed as catalysts for the decomposition of contaminants and thus
   eliminate sludge formation. This article investigates the use of
   iron-oxide nanoadsorbents to remove contaminants from wastewater. A
   later paper considers their use as catalysts for decomposition.
   In this study, goethite (a type of iron oxide) nanoparticles was
   employed for the removal of methylene blue from an aqueous solution,
   using a batch-adsorption technique. Effects of contact time, initial
   concentration of methylene blue, temperature, and solution pH on the
   adsorbed amount of methylene blue were investigated. Adsorption was
   rapid, as equilibrium was achieved within 20 minutes. An external mass
   transfer model fit adsorption kinetic results well and provided
   reasonable overall volumetric mass transfer coefficients. Increases in
   initial concentration, temperature, and pH favored the adsorption of
   methylene blue. Adsorption data fit both the Langmuir and Freundlich
   isotherm models well, with the better fit to the Langmuir model.
   Thermodynamic studies confirmed that the adsorption reaction was
   spontaneous and endothermic in nature.}},

Abstract = {{Polystyrene/polyaniline (PS/PANI) composites were prepared by emulsion
   polymerization of aniline in a mixture of PS and dichloromethane, at
   different feeding ratios of aniline to PS. Dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid
   (DBSA) was used as a dopant during chemical oxidation of aniline.
   Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, wide angle X-ray
   diffraction (WAXD), scanning and transmission electron microscopies (SEM
   and TEM) were used for structural characterization of the composites.
   The effect of PANI content on electrical properties of the composites
   was studied by electrical resistivity and electromagnetic interference
   (EMI) shielding measurements. Electron microscopy showed that the
   conductive PANI distributed in the continuous PS matrix,
   heterogeneously. Electrical conductivity, EMI shielding effectiveness,
   real permittivity and imaginary permittivity values increased with PANI
   content. It was found that absorption had more contribution to EMI
   shielding than reflection. 1.1 mm thick samples of the composites
   exhibited electrical conductivity up to 10(-2) S/cm and electromagnetic
   interference shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) up to 8 dB, for sample

Abstract = {{Anatomically realistic and biophysically detailed multiscale computer
   models of the heart are playing an increasingly important role in
   advancing our understanding of integrated cardiac function in health and
   disease. Such detailed simulations, however, are computationally vastly
   demanding, which is a limiting factor for a wider adoption of in-silico
   modeling. While current trends in high-performance computing (HPC)
   hardware promise to alleviate this problem, exploiting the potential of
   such architectures remains challenging since strongly scalable
   algorithms are necessitated to reduce execution times. Alternatively,
   acceleration technologies such as graphics processing units (GPUs) are
   being considered. While the potential of GPUs has been demonstrated in
   various applications, benefits in the context of bidomain simulations
   where large sparse linear systems have to be solved in parallel with
   advanced numerical techniques are less clear. In this study, the
   feasibility of multi-GPU bidomain simulations is demonstrated by running
   strong scalability benchmarks using a state-of-the-art model of rabbit
   ventricles. The model is spatially discretized using the finite element
   methods (FEM) on fully unstructured grids. The GPU code is directly
   derived from a large pre-existing code, the Cardiac Arrhythmia Research
   Package (CARP), with very minor perturbation of the code base. Overall,
   bidomain simulations were sped up by a factor of 11.8 to 16.3 in
   benchmarks running on 620 GPUs compared to the same number of CPU cores.
   To match the fastest GPU simulation which engaged 20 GPUs, 476 CPU cores
   were required on a national supercomputing facility.}},

Abstract = {{A variety of competing algorithms exist for segmentation of both
   single-channel and multichannel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images.
   Among the most successful of these algorithms is the approach presented
   by Stewart et al. This algorithm defines a cost which is a weighted sum
   of a likelihood term that estimates the statistical likelihood of the
   membership of pixels to neighboring segments and a shape term that is
   intended to provide a smoothing constraint on segment boundaries. The
   shape term in the original implementation of the Stewart algorithm was
   rather rudimentary, and in this paper, we explore the performance of a
   shape term based on Sethian-Osher curvature-flow theory. We demonstrate
   the performance of the refined curvature-cost (CC) shape term on a set
   of simulated images as well as an ASAR scene. We assess the segmentation
   performance using a hybridized shape metric and on the number of
   segments produced. We find that the CC shape term significantly improves
   the performance of the Stewart segmentation algorithm, particularly for
   high-contrast edges. In spite of this success, we argue that further
   improvements to the algorithm will be difficult due to the architecture
   of the system.}},

Title = {{Pore-throat radius and tortuosity estimation from formation resistivity
   data for tight-gas sandstone reservoirs}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{65-73}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{A new model is proposed for estimation of pore-throat aperture size from
   formation resistivity factor and permeability data. The model is
   validated with data from the Mesaverde sandstone using brine salinities
   ranging from 20,000 to 200,000 ppm. The data analyzed includes various
   basins such as Green River, Piceance, Sand Wash, Powder River, Uinta,
   Washakie and Wind River, available in the literature. For pore-throat
   radii analysis the methodology involves the use of log-log plots of
   pore-throat radius versus the product of formation resistivity factor
   and permeability (r(T) = alpha(FK)(b) + c). The model fits over 280
   samples from the Mesaverde formation with coefficients of determination
   varying between 0.95 and 0.99 depending primarily on the type of model
   used for pore throat radius calculation. The brine salinity has some
   minor effects on the results. The model can provide better estimates of
   pore-throat radii if it is calibrated with experimental techniques such
   as mercury porosimetry. The results show pore-throat radii varying
   between 0.001 and 5 mu m for the Mesaverde tight sandstone; however,
   most of the samples fall in a range between 0.01 and 1 mu m.
   For tortuosity analysis, the calculation involves the use of product of
   formation factor and porosity data. Results indicate that the estimated
   tortuosity values range mainly between 1 and 5. For samples with lower
   porosities (<5\%), tortuosity values show a wider scatter (between 1 and
   8); whereas for samples with larger porosities (> 15\%), the scattering
   in tortuosity decreases significantly. In general, for tortuosity
   calculation in tight gas sandstone formations, a square root model with
   a parameter (b(f)) representing various types of connecting pores, i.e.,
   sheet-like and tubular pores, is recommended. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

   interference. The corrosion of steel is enhanced by the applied AC
   current density from 0 to 400 A/m(2). With the further increase to 600
   A/m(2) and 800 A/m(2), the corrosion rate of the steel decreases, which
   is attributed to the formation of a compact corrosion product layer on
   the steel surface at sufficiently high AC current densities, and a
   compact film is formed on the steel surface. While AC could enhance
   corrosion of the steel, only a very small percentage of AC current is
   involved in the steel dissolution (acts as Faradaic current). The vast
   majority of AC either participates in the charging-discharging process
   (acts as non-Faradaic current) of the double-charge layer or gets
   involved in the redox reaction of water. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{According to United States Department of Transport (USDOT) statistics,
   roadway accidents are the leading cause of death for the age group 4-34
   years with over 30,000 deaths a year. These roadway accidents also have
   a direct economic cost of over \$200 billion. Day-to-day roadway traffic
   congestion is estimated to drain around 4.2 billion lost hours per year
   and the associated financial loss is estimated to be over \$87 billion.
   The use of wireless technology to enable communications between all road
   user entities (generally termed V2X or Vehicle-to-Entity) so that they
   are aware of each other is seen as a promising approach to lessen the
   negative implications of road accidents and traffic congestion. USDOT
   Intelli-Drive program is the official initiative to do exactly that.
   The capability to estimate the position of a given entity with respect
   to another is a critical requirement in all V2X applications. Therefore,
   positioning and wireless communication capabilities can be considered
   the two critical building blocks of all V2X applications. Once all the
   technical challenges are addressed, V2X can be a paradigm changer and
   people will be able to rely on V2X technology to assist them in
   day-to-day driving to improve their safety, efficiency, and security.
   Eventually, the V2X-based awareness may be supplanted by various levels
   of vehicle control, ranging from crash avoidance to fully automated
   driving. For V2X application deployment to be feasible, all technologies
   that are a part of V2X have to be accurate, reliable and available in
   all drivable environments. GNSS being a key V2X enabler, this implies
   strict accuracy, reliability and availability requirements for
   GNSS-based positioning.
   Crash Avoidance Metrics Partnership (CAMP), a consortium of automakers
   has been working on V2X technologies for a number of years as a
   collaborative effort with the USDOT support. Among the most recent
   research and development work done by this consortium is the Vehicle
   Safety Communications-Applications (VSC-A) project. As a part of this
   work, an interoperable Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications enabled
   fleet was built. More importantly, GNSS service availability and
   accuracy as applicable to V2X applications was investigated. The
   Position, Location, and Navigation (PLAN) Group of the University of
   Calgary conducted related extensive field trials in late 2009. This
   paper provides a summary of the goals and findings of this study and,
   more importantly, provides some insights on the positioning technology
   challenges ahead.
   The study used a Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) link that
   was previously developed and tested as a part of CAMP-USDOT
   collaborative efforts for between vehicle communications. The method
   that will be selected for V2X relative positioning has a direct impact
   on the data volume shared Over-the-Air using the DSRC data link.
   Therefore, this study and its findings are of great importance for data
   management in Vehicular Networks. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Techniques for visualizing and quantifying the microvasculature of
   tumors are essential not only for studying angiogenic processes but also
   for monitoring the effects of anti-angiogenic treatments. Given the
   relatively limited information that can be gleaned from conventional 2-D
   histological analyses, there has been considerable interest in methods
   that enable the 3-D assessment of the vasculature. To this end, we
   employed a polymerizing intravascular contrast medium (Microfil) and
   micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) in combination with a maximal
   spheres direct 3-D analysis method to visualize and quantify ex-vivo
   vessel structural features, and to define regions of hypoperfusion
   within tumors that would be indicative of necrosis. Employing these
   techniques we quantified the effects of a vascular disrupting agent on
   the tumor vasculature. The methods described herein for quantifying
   whole tumor vascularity represent a significant advance in the 3-D study
   of tumor angiogenesis and evaluation of novel therapeutics, and will
   also find potential application in other fields where quantification of
   blood vessel structure and necrosis are important outcome parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of processing sequence on the clay dispersion, phase morphology,
   and thermal and rheological properties of PA6-HDPE-clay nanocomposites
   are investigated in this study. It has been found that the processing
   sequence plays a key role in the clay dispersion and phase morphology of
   the PA6-HDPE-clay nanocomposites. When PA6 is extruded with clay first,
   either in the absence or presence of HDPE, a continuous PA6 phase domain
   forms with exfoliated clay platelets that seem to have strong
   interaction with the dispersed HDPE droplets, leading to a favorable
   phase morphology. When HDPE is extruded with clay in the first
   extrusion, nonpolar HDPE molecules are sheared into the clay interlayers
   and form HDPE intercalated clay, and the HDPE-clay aggregates do not
   have strong interactions with PA6 in the second extrusion, resulting in
   a phase morphology of large HDPE particles of hundreds of microns in
   size dispersed in PA6 phase. The DSC results indicate strong interaction
   between the polymers and clay; in particular, it is shown there is
   stabilization of ?-form crystals by the compatibilizer (PEMA).
   Rheological characterization indicates that the PA6-HDPE-clay
   nanocomposites exhibit significantly high storage and complex viscosity
   in the entire frequency range, and the loss modulus of the
   nanocomposites that have an exfoliated clay dispersion is lower than
   that of PA6 at high frequency. The results of this study suggest two
   types of microstructures of the PA6-HDPE-clay nanocomposites are
   possible using different processing sequences. (C) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {{Life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with two major

   emissions of current Oil Sands Technologies) developed in prior work
   Recovery and extraction of bitumen through surface mining and in situ
   processes result in 3-9 and 9-16 g CO(2)eq/MJ bitumen, respectively;
   upgrading emissions are an additional 6-17 g CO(2)eq/MJ synthetic crude
   oil (SCO) (all results are on a HHV basis). Although a high degree of
   variability exists in well-to-wheel emissions due to differences in
   technologies employed, operating conditions, and product
   characteristics, the surface mining dilbit and the in situ SCO pathways
   have the lowest and highest emissions, 88 and 120 g CO(2)eq/MJ
   reformulated gasoline. Through the use of improved data obtained from
   operating oil sands projects, we present ranges of emissions that
   overlap with emissions in literature for conventional crude oil. An
   increased focus is recommended in policy discussions on understanding
   interproject variability of emissions of both oil sands and conventional
   crudes, as this has not been adequately represented in previous studies.}},

Abstract = {{Removal of asphaltenes from heavy oil improves the quality of oil and
   makes it easier to process. To this end, Nassar et al. {[}1] recently
   showed that NiO nanoparticles have high affinity toward asphaltene
   adsorption. This investigation, however, involved toluene model
   solutions and commercially available nanoparticles. In the current work,
   we show that NiO nanoparticles prepared in situ within heavy oil display
   much higher affinity toward asphaltenes adsorption, and uptake in the
   order of 2.8 g asphaltene/g nanoparticles is reported. This uptake way
   exceeds asphaltene adsorption onto conventional porous adsorbents and
   commercial nanoparticles from toluene model solutions. Nanoparticle
   preparation followed a method developed by our group {[}2], and XRD.
   EDX, and TEM analyses confirmed the formation of NiO nanoparticles of 12
   +/- 5 nm mean diameter. Kinetic experiments showed that, while
   equilibrium could be achieved in less than 2 h for both in situ prepared
   and commercial NiO particles, much higher adsorption took place onto the
   in situ prepared ones, owing to their better dispersion. Contrary to
   literature findings on adsorption from model solutions onto
   nanoparticles, surface coverage calculations revealed multilayer
   adsorption. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Soil samples were collected in tidal freshwater and salt marshes in the
   Yellow River Delta (YRD), northern China, before and after the
   flow-sediment regulation. Total concentrations of arsenic (As), cadmium
   (Cd), copper (Cu), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) were determined using
   inductively coupled plasma atomic absorption spectrometry to investigate
   the characteristics of heavy metal pollution in tidal wetlands before
   and after the regulation regime. The results demonstrated that marsh
   soils in both marshes had higher silt and total P contents, higher bulk
   density and lower sand contents after the flow-sediment regulation;
   moreover, soil salinity was significantly decreased in the tidal salt
   marsh. As and Cd concentrations were significantly higher in both marsh
   soils after the regulation than before, and there were no significant
   differences in the concentrations of Cu, Pb and Zn measured before and
   after the regulation. No significant differences in heavy metal
   concentrations were observed between freshwater and salt marsh soils,
   either before or after the regulation. Before the regulation regime,
   soil organic matter, pH and sulfer (S) were the main factors influencing
   heavy metal distribution in tidal freshwater marshes, whereas for tidal
   salt marshes, the main factors are soil salinity and moisture, pH and S.
   However, bulk density and total P became the main influencing factors
   after the regulation. The sediment quality guidelines and
   geoaccumulation indices showed moderately or strongly polluted levels of
   As and Cd and unpolluted or moderately polluted levels of Cu, Pb and Zn;
   As and Cd pollution became more serious after the regulation. Factor
   analysis indicated thatthese heavy metals including As were closely
   correlated and orginated from common pollution sources before the
   flow-sediment regulation; however, the sources of As and Cd separated
   from the sources of Cu, Pb and Zn after the regulation regime, implying
   that the flow-sediment regulation regime contributed to As and Cd
   accumulation in the YRD. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Chip based pathogen detection is one of the prime motivation for
   research in the field of microfluidics. Thus far, on-chip detection has
   primarily been demonstrated using closed-channel microfluidic devices,
   which are prone to certain limitations in terms of detection threshold
   and complexity of sample handling. Present day pathogen detection
   methods are often `bead based assays' and their success is substantially
   influenced by the dispensing and manipulation capability of the utilized
   microfluidic technology. This work utilizes liquid dielectrophoresis
   (LDEP) based surface microfluidics (SMF) devices to automatically
   dispense ultra-low concentration of various microbead samples (different
   in size and functionalities) by judiciously adjusting conductivity and
   theological properties of actuated carrier fluids. Control over size and
   concentration of dispensed beads along with further manipulation and
   mixing for bead based bio-assays has been successfully demonstrated. The
   application for the proposed rapid, ultra-low, bead-based DNA
   hybridization detection scheme, where 1-2 micro-beads can be manipulated
   in nanoliter sized aliquots for detection in range of similar to 100
   attomoles, is envisioned for post amplification screening assays. In
   conclusion, we propose that LDEP based devices can be usefully applied
   and serve as alternative to the conventional closed channel device for
   ultra-low bead based detection and screening assays. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Circumferential wrapping of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) sheets is one
   of the most common applications for repair and rehabilitation of
   large-scale columns. Common types of fibers used for wrapping are carbon
   FRP (CFRP), glass FRP (GFRP), and aramid FRP (AFRP). Recently, steel FRP
   (SFRP) has been introduced as a new class of composites for
   strengthening applications. Up to now, there has been no experimental
   data available on the behavior of large-scale columns wrapped with SFRP
   sheets. Thus, in this paper, the behavior of nonreinforced and
   reinforced large-scale columns (300 x 1; 200 mm) wrapped with CFRP and
   SFRP sheets is examined and compared with that of unwrapped columns. The
   experimental results include stress-strain behavior, ultimate stress,
   ultimate strain, dilation, and ductility of large-scale columns. This
   study presents the first ever insight into the strain variation of
   large-scale circular columns wrapped with CFRP and SFRP sheets using the
   digital image correlation technique (DICT). This technique is a
   photogrammetric technique that allows capturing strains from the surface
   of FRP-confined concrete. Results from DICT were used to analyze the
   strain efficiency of the SFRP sheets. Results indicate that the overall
   performance of the SFRP-wrapped concrete columns is superior to that of
   the CFRP-wrapped concrete columns. DOI:

Abstract = {{Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) has demonstrated its capabilities as
   a prominent technique for the direct acquisition of high density and
   accurate topographic information. To achieve the potential accuracy of
   such systems, a rigorous system calibration should be performed. We
   introduce a novel rigorous LiDAR system calibration procedure where the
   system parameters are determined by minimizing the discrepancies among
   conjugate surface elements in overlapping strips and control data, if
   available. The method is automated and does not require specific
   features (e.g., planes or lines) in the covered area or
   preclassification of the point cloud. Suitable primitives, which do not
   involve preprocessing of the data, are implemented. The correspondence
   between conjugate primitives is determined using a robust matching
   procedure. A modification to the Gauss Markov model is introduced to
   keep the implementation of the calibration procedure simple while
   utilizing higher order primitives. Experimental results have
   demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method over different
   types of terrain coverage. (C) 2012 Society of Photo-Optical

Title = {{Estimation of interwell connectivity in the case of unmeasured

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{90-91}},
Pages = {{79-95}},

Abstract = {{Injection and production rates are often the most readily available data
   in a waterflood. Yousef and coworkers have shown that these data can be
   analyzed using a method, called the capacitance model (CM), to determine
   interwell connectivity. The connectivities can, in turn, provide a tool
   for reservoir characterization and management. The CM gives best results
   when the number of producers is constant and when the producer pressures
   (BHPs) are known. If pressures are unavailable (as is often true with
   legacy assets), they are assumed to be constant over the time period
   being analyzed. In many cases, however, these conditions are not
   satisfied. This paper describes two enhancements of the CM to relax
   these requirements: the segmented CM and the compensated CM. Taken
   together, these become the segmented/compensated CM and provide a means
   to increase the CM tolerance to common field conditions.
   The segmented CM can be used where unknown BHPs change during the
   analysis interval. The compensated CM overcomes the requirement to rerun
   the model after adding a new producer or after shutting-in an existing
   producer. If both BHP changes and shut-in periods occur, both modified
   CMs can be used simultaneously to construct a single model for a period
   of data.
   In several simulated cases with unmeasured fluctuating BHPs, the
   segmented and compensated CM successfully determined the true interwell
   connectivities. Ignoring the BHP data typically gave 2-10 times the root
   mean squared error of the segmented/compensated CMs. In an application
   to North Buck Draw field, which both lacks BHP data and has several
   producer shut-ins, the CM connectivity parameters were compared to the
   tracer test results and an earlier geological study. We observed good
   agreement between the modified CM and the amounts of higher-quality
   fluvial facies in the system. Also, the CM results correlated better
   with the results from tracer tests run in the field than when the
   unmodified CM was applied. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In this paper a novel step length model using a handheld Micro
   Electrical Mechanical System (MEMS) is presented. It combines the user's
   step frequency and height with a set of three parameters for estimating
   step length. The model has been developed and trained using 12 different
   subjects: six men and six women. For reliable estimation of the step
   frequency with a handheld device, the frequency content of the handheld
   sensor's signal is extracted by applying the Short Time Fourier
   Transform (STFT) independently from the step detection process. The
   relationship between step and hand frequencies is analyzed for different
   hand's motions and sensor carrying modes. For this purpose, the
   frequency content of synchronized signals collected with two sensors
   placed in the hand and on the foot of a pedestrian has been extracted.
   Performance of the proposed step length model is assessed with several
   field tests involving 10 test subjects different from the above 12. The
   percentages of error over the travelled distance using universal
   parameters and a set of parameters calibrated for each subject are
   compared. The fitted solutions show an error between 2.5 and 5\% of the
   travelled distance, which is comparable with that achieved by models
   proposed in the literature for body fixed sensors only.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a technique for separating vanadyl-oxide

   sequential separation of heavy oil and VOTPP from a solvent mixture of
   (4:1) volume ratio tetrahydrofuran, THF, and methanol upon stepwise
   addition of 1.0 M aqueous NaCl solution. Nevertheless, the salting-out
   of VOTPP from the solvent mixture was not NaCl specific, and many
   electrolytic solutions produced the same effect. The leftover
   concentration of heavy oil and VOTPP was determined using UV-vis
   spectroscopy following the Beer-Lambert law. Two bands were targeted,
   one at 549 nm and another at 700 nm. Both bands were assigned for heavy
   oil, and one, alpha band, at 549 nm was assigned for VOTPP. Accordingly,
   the leftover concentration of VOTPP was back calculated once the
   concentration of heavy oil was obtained from the absorbance measurement
   at 700 nm. Optimum separation required lower volume percent of NaCl at
   lower heavy oil concentration, and 10 vol \% NaCl provided the best
   window for separation at 100 ppm heavy oil, while 20 vol \% was needed
   for 1000 and 2000 ppm heavy oil.}},

Abstract = {{In multi-sensor tracking, registration is expected to be performed at
   the track level instead of the measurement level especially for the
   distributed sensor networks. However, registration at the track level
   becomes more difficult due to the implicit sensor biases hidden behind
   the local tracks. We propose a pseudo-measurement approach to solve the
   simultaneous registration and fusion problem at the track level. A
   pseudo-measurement equation is derived from the local trackers, which
   explicitly reveals the relationship between the pseudo-measurements and
   the sensor biases in a closed-form expression. The resulting
   registration model then allows us to formulate the track registration
   and fusion as a maximum likelihood (ML) estimation problem. We propose
   using the expectation maximization (EM) approach to perform track
   registration and fusion simultaneously. Both batch and recursive EM
   algorithms are developed, accompanied by the performance analysis.
   Simulation results demonstrate that both EM algorithms are capable of
   providing accurate estimates. Moreover, we apply the proposed method to
   an air surveillance radar network which suffers from relatively serious
   registration problems. The proposed method is verified to effectively
   fuse and register the tracks generated by local radars and to provide a
   consistent air picture.}},

Abstract = {{Wetland cultivation and its effects on soil properties in salt marshes
   in the Yellow River Delta, China were examined by using a combination of
   the satellite imageries and field experiments. Results showed that the
   conversions mainly occurred between dry lands and Phragmites
   australis-Suaeda salsa-Tamarix chinensis marshes (PSTMs). The total area
   of marsh wetland was reduced by 65.09 km(2) during the period from 1986
   to 2005, and these conversions might be attributed to a combination of
   farming, oil exploration and water extraction, as well as soil
   salinization. Significant differences were observed in bulk density, pH,
   salinity and NO3--N between different land-use types (P < 0.05). After
   the conversions from marsh wetlands to dry lands, bulk density, pH,
   salinity and NH4+-N decreased slightly, while a significant increase in
   NO3--N. TN (total nitrogen), and AP (available phosphorus) (P < 0.05)
   was observed. The more loss of soil nutrient storage also occurred after
   the maximal area conversion from PSTMs to dry lands compared to other
   conversions during the study period. The storages of soil organic
   matter, NH4+-N and total phosphorus decreased greatly under the
   conversion from three types of marshes to dry lands, while those of
   NO3--N, AP and TN showed an obvious increase during the whole study
   period. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{We present a new inversion strategy that integrates radar-based methods
   with microwave tomography (MT) to efficiently provide low resolution
   information about an object's structure and average dielectric
   properties. For this preliminary investigation, we assume that the
   object may be characterized as having three regions: a thin outer layer
   and an interior with two inhomogeneous regions having dissimilar average
   dielectric properties. Our aim is not to reconstruct a detailed image of
   an object, but rather to provide information about its basic structure,
   including the geometric and mean dielectric properties of regions
   predominantly composed of a given material. The inversion technique is
   carried out in two steps. First, a reconstruction model indicating the
   locations and spatial features of the three regions of interest is
   constructed efficiently and quickly using ultrawideband (UWB) reflection
   data. The reconstruction model formed using radar-based techniques is
   then incorporated into the second step of the procedure which estimates
   the mean dielectric properties over each region using MT methods.
   Identifying the three homogeneous regions with radar-based techniques
   provides a priori information about an object's internal geometry and
   significantly simplifies the parameter space structure so that the
   inverse scattering problem solved with MT is not as ill-posed as those
   typically encountered. The performance of the proposed technique is
   first evaluated with both reflection and transmission data generated by
   progressively more complex 2D numerical models. Microwave breast imaging
   approaches would benefit from the internal structural information
   extracted by the algorithm, so a practical application is explored using
   2D breast models formed from the magnetic resonance (MR) scans of a
   patient study. The algorithm's ability to infer the breast's basic
   internal structure is demonstrated with these examples.}},

Abstract = {{Spoofing sources can effectively disrupt a GPS receiver during the
   acquisition phase by generating multiple false correlation peaks and
   increasing the noise floor. Such deceptive correlation peaks can mislead
   the GPS receiver into acquiring the spoofer generated signals rather
   than the authentic signals. Also, the spoofer can increase the receiver
   noise floor to bury the authentic signals in the noise and at the same
   time generate correlation peaks with amplitudes commensurate with
   reasonable C/N0 expectations. The main focus of this paper is on
   assessment of the reduced effectiveness of the GPS spoofer
   countermeasure during acquisition where the GPS receiver utilizes C/N0
   discrimination. As shown, whereas the C/N0 discrimination is of limited
   effectiveness, with a modest circuit modification, the receiver can
   measure the absolute power of the correlation peaks, which is an
   effective means of detecting and discriminating spoofer sources. It will
   be shown that employing absolute power monitoring technique considerably
   reduces the vulnerability region of the receiver compared with the C/N0
   monitoring techniques. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) Doppler measurements are
   commonly used for velocity-based relative positioning and aiding
   Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) in signal degraded environments. The
   aim of this paper is to characterise the Doppler measurements in GNSS
   harsh multipath environments. In multipath fading situations such as
   indoor and urban canyon environments, multipath components arrive to the
   receiver antenna from different paths and directions. These give rise to
   various Doppler shifts that cause errors in the velocity solution. In
   this work the Doppler measurements discrepancy characterised by Doppler
   spread in multipath environments is investigated. By assuming a `sphere
   of scatterers' model and considering the antenna gain pattern, the
   theoretical Power Spectral Density (PSD) observed by a receiver is
   formulated. The theoretical findings are examined using two sets of
   measurements in dense multipath environments. Global Positioning System
   (GPS) live signals using non-isotropic antennas with different
   orientations are used for this purpose. Different motion directions are
   also examined using different data sets. An Assisted GPS (A-GPS)
   approach is utilised where the code phase and the navigation data bits
   are provided by a nearby outdoor antenna. By applying a `Block
   Processing' technique, an epoch-by-epoch Doppler and velocity estimation
   is implemented. Herein, the Doppler and velocity measurements accuracy
   in addition to the Doppler spread characterization are studied. As shown
   both theoretically and experimentally, in harsh multipath environments
   the PSD of the observed signals is a function of the scatterers'
   geometry and the antenna gain pattern. The Doppler estimation accuracies
   in multipath and multipath-free cases are compared for different ranges
   of Carrier-to-Noise ratio (C/N-0). Theoretical and experimental results
   revealed inaccurate Doppler estimation and poor Doppler-derived velocity
   solutions in dense multipath environments.}},

Abstract = {{A total histological grade does not necessarily distinguish between
   different manifestations of cartilage damage or degeneration. An
   accurate and reliable histological assessment method is required to
   separate normal and pathological tissue within a joint during treatment
   of degenerative joint conditions and to sub-classify the latter in
   meaningful ways. The Modified Mankin method may be adaptable for this
   purpose. We investigated how much detail may be lost by assigning one
   composite score/grade to represent different degenerative components of
   the osteoarthritic condition. We used four ovine injury models (sham
   surgery, anterior cruciate ligament/medial collateral ligament
   instability, simulated anatomic anterior cruciate ligament
   reconstruction and meniscal removal) to induce different degrees and
   potentially types (mechanisms) of osteoarthritis. Articular cartilage
   was systematically harvested, prepared for histological examination and
   graded in a blinded fashion using a Modified Mankin grading method.
   Results showed that the possible permutations of cartilage damage were
   significant and far more varied than the current intended use that
   histological grading systems allow. Of 1352 cartilage specimens graded,
   234 different manifestations of potential histological damage were
   observed across 23 potential individual grades of the Modified Mankin
   grading method. The results presented here show that current composite
   histological grading may contain additional information that could
   potentially discern different stages or mechanisms of cartilage damage
   and degeneration in a sheep model. This approach may be applicable to
   other grading systems.}},

Abstract = {{This work investigates the existence and importance of the micro bubbles
   in heavy oil subjected to solution-gas drive. The term `micro bubble'
   will be used to refer to the free-gas phase that flows with the oil, no
   faster and no slower. Two types of experiments are reported here; slow
   and fast experiments. These experiments were previously reported by
   Sheikha and Pooladi-Darvish (SPE Res Eval Eng 12(3):390-398, 2009) and
   were used to investigate the effects of pressure gradient and depletion
   rate of oil recovery. In this work, we investigate the nature of
   two-phase flow, and find that in the slow runs, the flow was
   characterized by single-phase flow of oil until a gas saturation of 2
   +/- 1\% was reached. Above this gas saturation, bulk flow of gas was
   observed at mobilities much higher than that of micro bubbles. Recovery
   factor of the slow tests was below 4\%. In the fast runs, flow of
   bubbles is observed shortly after they are formed in porous media. The
   gas mobility and fractional flow remain low until a gas saturation of 7
   +/- 1\% is reached. Flow of gas between approximately 2 and 7\% gas
   saturation is consistent with that of micro bubbles. Gas fractional flow
   increases sharply at gas saturations above approximately 7\%. The
   results indicate that the attainment of high recovery values (12-14\%)
   observed in the fast experiments is partially as a result of low
   mobility of micro-gas bubbles. The pressure decline rate of each flow
   experiment was varied independent of its respective withdrawal rate.
   This did not alter the difference in recovery and mobility behaviour of
   the fast and slow experiments; the fast experiments exhibited a
   significant period of low mobility gas flow consistent with flow of
   micro bubbles. Regardless of the pressure decline rate, the slow
   experiments did not exhibit this period of low mobility gas flow.}},

Abstract = {{The construction of a tunnel in soft ground generally induces short-term
   and long-term ground settlements above the tunnel. In this study, finite
   element analysis of surface settlement above a shallow tunnel in clay
   till was performed. Field observations were performed to monitor the
   ground settlements above the tunnel and pore pressure changes around the
   tunnel. Four cases were simulated to investigate the influences of soil
   creep and flow boundary on surface settlement above the tunnel. The
   predicted surface settlement and pore pressure change were compared with
   those from field observations. From this study, it was found that creep
   behavior of the clay till played an important role in quantifying the
   long-term settlements above the tunnel, and the primary lining used in
   the tunnel construction could be approximately simulated by permeable
   flow boundary at the tunnel periphery. In addition, the influence of
   concrete lining installation on the long-term surface settlement was
   discussed. Crown Copyright (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Architectural distortion is an important sign of early breast cancer.
   Due to its subtlety, it is often missed during screening. We propose a
   method to detect architectural distortion in prior mammograms of
   interval-cancer cases based on statistical measures of oriented
   patterns. Oriented patterns were analyzed in the present work because
   regions with architectural distortion contain a large number of tissue
   structures spread over a wide angular range. Two new types of
   cooccurrence matrices were derived to estimate the joint occurrence of
   the angles of oriented structures. Statistical features were computed
   from each of the angle cooccurrence matrices to discriminate sites of
   architectural distortion from falsely detected regions in normal parts
   of mammograms. A total of 4,224 regions of interest (ROIs) were
   automatically obtained from 106 prior mammograms of 56 interval-cancer
   cases and 52 mammograms of 13 normal cases with the application of Gabor
   filters and phase portrait analysis. For each ROI, Haralick's 14
   features were computed using the angle cooccurrence matrices. The best
   result obtained in terms of the area under the receiver operating
   characteristic (ROC) curve with the leave-one-patient-out method was
   0.76; the free-response ROC curve indicated a sensitivity of 80\% at 4.2
   false positives per patient. (C) 2012 SPIE and IS\&T. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{The interaction of animals with abiotic features of their environment
   has long been known to cause alterations to geomorphic features, and
   these interactions may cause feedback loops that further alter
   geomorphic features and animal communities. This paper samples the
   literature on selected burrowing animals in western North America, and
   discusses the interactions of animals with abiotic features of the
   environment and with each other, and the resulting impacts on geomorphic
   features and each other. As expected, burrowing characteristics of
   animals influence geomorphological processes. For example, pocket
   gophers and certain ground squirrels that burrow horizontal tunnels on
   sloping grounds seem to have significant impacts on horizontal movement
   of soils, whereas prairie dogs and harvester ants have more impact on
   vertical movement of soils. Burrowing animals, in general, increase the
   patchiness of the environment, which creates localized patch habitat for
   other plants and animals, thereby increasing biodiversity at the
   landscape scale. Burrowing animals influence and are influenced by
   microbes: sylvatic plague wiped out large populations of prairie dogs,
   earthworms cause major changes in soil microflora, pocket gophers and
   harvester ants cause changes in mycorrhizal communities, which in turn
   impact plant communities. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{96-102}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs) are preferred over other
   variable speed generators because of their advantages in terms of
   economy and control. One of the problems associated with high wind power
   penetration DFIG systems, however, is the inability of their converters
   to work properly under extreme low voltage conditions. This article
   presents a decoupled P-Q control strategy of a supercapacitor energy
   storage system, interfaced through a STATCOM, for low voltage ride
   through as well as damping enhancement of the DFIG system. The STATCOM
   meets the reactive power need under the depressed voltage condition,
   while the supercapacitor caters to the real power unbalance. An
   extensive dynamic model of the DFIG system including a supercapacitor
   DC-DC buck-boost converter and the STATCOM circuit has been developed.
   The fault ride-thorough capability of the generator has been
   investigated for a severe symmetrical three-phase to ground fault on the
   grid bus. Simulation results suggest that the proposed decoupled control
   of the supercapacitor STATCOM control strategy can help the DFIG ride
   through extreme low voltage conditions for significant duration. The
   proposed control strategy also damps the electromechanical transients,
   and thus quickly restores normal operation of the converters. (C) 2012

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{97}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the effect of viscous instability at varying salinities
   of the displacing non-wetting phase (i.e., surfactant-polymer solution)
   in surfactant-polymer flooding of heavy oil reservoirs-which is a
   viscous-modified low-interfacial tension (IFT) flow through an initially
   preferential oil-wet porous medium-is quantified in the presence of the
   adverse mobility ratio. The dynamic mean pore-scale capillary number
   values are determined using two different approaches. The first approach
   is a Pore network approach (PNA) that excludes the viscous instability
   effects. The second approach is using the Viscous instability model
   (VIM) proposed by Peters and Flock {[}49] in which the concept of the
   wavelength of the viscous fingers is introduced. Afterwards, these two
   dynamic mean pore-scale capillary number values are compared to each
   other to highlight the effects of viscous instability at different
   salinity levels of the surfactant-polymer solution. The results show
   that including the viscous instability effects in the qualitative and
   quantitative evaluations of the viscous-modified low-IFT flow is vital.
   In particular, the viscous instability effects become more complex near
   the breakthrough of the displacing non-wetting phase. Furthermore, the
   effects of the salinity on the dynamic mean pore-scale capillary number
   (by excluding/excluding the viscous instability effects, i.e., from PNA
   and VIM, respectively), IFT, dynamic viscosity, contact angle,
   displacement front configuration, wavelength of the viscous fingers,
   dynamic values of the desaturated displaced wetting phase, breakthrough
   time, and the time of infinite injected pore volume is discussed in the
   surfactant-polymer flooding of an initially preferential oil-wet porous
   medium containing heavy oil. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   acids and methane) with a genetic algorithm, while the remaining ones
   are fixed to values obtained from literature. In the second step a
   gradient descendent algorithm is used to carry out a fine readjustment
   of the whole set of parameters, not only those assumed as fixed but also
   those fitted with the genetic algorithm. Values of COD, acetic and
   propionic acids and methane obtained from the simulation of the model
   with the optimized parameters are very close to those directly obtained
   from the prototype. As the model efficiently reproduces the behavior of
   an anaerobic digestor treating slaughterhouse effluents it may be used
   to test different controllers in order to efficiently obtain both a
   waste degradation and a methane generation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A new technique of transmitting encrypted combinations of gray scaled
   and chromatic images using chaotic lasers derived from Maxwell-Bloch's
   equations has been proposed. This novel scheme utilizes the general
   method of solution of a set of linear equations to transmit similar
   sized heterogeneous images which are a combination of monochrome and
   chromatic images. The chaos encrypted gray scaled images are
   concatenated along the three color planes resulting in color images.
   These are then transmitted over a secure channel along with a cover
   image which is an iris scan. The entire cryptology is augmented with an
   iris-based authentication scheme. The secret messages are retrieved once
   the authentication is successful. The objective of our work is briefly
   outlined as (a) the biometric information is the iris which is encrypted
   before transmission, (b) the iris is used for personal identification
   and verifying for message integrity, (c) the information is transmitted
   securely which are colored images resulting from a combination of gray
   images, (d) each of the images transmitted are encrypted through chaos
   based cryptography, (e) these encrypted multiple images are then coupled
   with the iris through linear combination of images before being
   communicated over the network. The several layers of encryption together
   with the ergodicity and randomness of chaos render enough confusion and
   diffusion properties which guarantee a fool-proof approach in achieving
   secure communication as demonstrated by exhaustive statistical methods.
   The result is vital from the perspective of opening a fundamental new
   dimension in multiplexing and simultaneous transmission of several
   monochromatic and chromatic images along with biometry based
   authentication and cryptography. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{An accurate thermodynamic predictive model is necessary to calculate
   mutual solubilities of injected gas and aqueous phases under subsurface
   disposal conditions. In this work, an accurate model is presented and
   discussed. The Peng-Robinson equation of state coupled with a non-random
   mixing rule is used to model sour and acid gas phase. The aqueous phase
   is modeled by Henry's law approach. Good agreement between this model
   and experimental data available in the literature was observed. The
   aqueous phase solubility and water content of pure CH4, CO2, and H2S
   were represented with absolute average relative deviations of less than
   6.3\% and 5.6\%, respectively. The applicability of this model in
   calculating the solubility of these components in aqueous NaCl and other
   salt solutions was evaluated by comparisons between the results of this
   model, the experimental data, and some other models in the literature.
   An acceptable accuracy was found in the regeneration of the gas phase
   water content and the aqueous phase solubility of the mixtures of sour
   and acid gas in equilibrium with pure water. Furthermore, the model was
   tested for brine systems with salt concentrations up to 200,000 ppm, and
   accurate results were obtained. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The steam system is one of the main energy systems in steel industry,
   and its operational scheduling plays a crucial role for energy utility
   and resources saving. For a reasonable resources operation, the accurate
   prediction of steam flow is required. Considering the large amount of
   production data in energy system, a data-driven based model is proposed
   to perform a time series prediction for steam flow, in which a Bayesian
   echo state network (ESN) is established. This method combines Bayesian
   theory with ESN to obtain optimal output weight via maximizing the
   posterior probability density of the weights to avoid over-fitting in
   the training process of sample data. To pursue optimized
   hyper-parameters in the proposed Bayesian ESN, the evidence framework
   based on sample data is further adopted in this work. Experimental
   results using the real production data from Shanghai Baosteel show the
   validity and practicality of the proposed data-driven based model in
   providing scientific decision guidance for the steam system. Published

   (CloisiteNA) or di(hydrogenated tallow-alkyl) dimethyl ammonium-modified
   montmorillonites (Cloisite15A and Cloisite20A) were studied. The
   properties of clay/FKM nanocomposites were compared with composites
   prepared using 10 and 30 phr of carbon black. The effects of clay
   surfactant and surfactant concentration on the vulcanization behavior,
   mechanical, and dynamical properties of peroxide cured composites were
   studied. XRD results of cured composites showed a decrease in d-spacing
   and indicated deintercalation of the clays after the vulcanization
   process. It was also found that organoclays retard the FKM peroxide
   vulcanization process. Significantly, higher maximum torque on
   vulcanization was obtained with organoclays versus unmodified clay and
   carbon black. Although the morphologies of organoclay/FKM nanocomposites
   studied by XRD and TEM suggest similar intercalated/exfoliated
   structures, the organoclay with the lowest concentration of surfactant
   (95 meq/100 g clay) resulted in the highest increase in torque, modulus,
   hardness, and tear strength in the clay/FKM nanocomposites. It was also
   found that organoclays can increase both the hydrodynamic reinforcement

Abstract = {{Topological aspects of the turbulent wake of a finite, surface-mounted,
   square-cross-section cylinder of h/d = 4 are addressed by decomposing
   the velocity field into a quasi-periodic coherent part and the
   unresolved incoherent fluctuations. The three-dimensional large scale
   structure is educed through a reconstruction of planar phase-averaged
   PIV measurements using the simultaneously sampled surface pressure
   difference on opposing sides of the obstacle as a phase reference. A
   topological model for the vortex structure is educed and mean streamwise
   wake vorticity is explained in terms of the connections between
   initially vertical structures shed alternately from either side of the
   obstacle, rather than previously proposed `tip' vortex structures
   generated at the obstacle free-end. The coherent structure educed
   accounts for a significant portion of the fluctuating energy in the
   wake. The turbulent field is further analyzed by finding Lagrangian
   straining structures that form by induction of the coherent vorticity
   field, and these structures are related to the energy transfer from the
   base phase-averaged flow since they act to stretch incoherent vorticity
   fluctuations in their neighbourhood. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, the impact of large-scale integration of intermittent
   generation resources on electricity markets is studied through a supply
   function equilibrium model. A new formulation for determining supply
   function equilibria in uniform electricity markets is presented, where
   uncertainty of intermittent generation resources is taken into account.
   In the case of an unconstrained market model where generation limits are
   ignored, a closed form solution for market equilibrium is derived and
   its uniqueness is proved. In the case of a generation-constrained market
   model, an algorithm is proposed for determining supply function
   equilibria and the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium is
   discussed. Case studies are presented for demonstrating the proposed
   approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Cooling, refrigeration, and air conditioning processes are considered
   essential needs and major requirements for all human beings in our world
   today. However, the traditional vapor compression machines are
   dominating electricity consumers and their operation and propagation
   cause high electricity peak loads during the summer, especially in those
   countries with tropical climate. That is besides their refrigerants
   having high global warming as well as ozone layer depletion potentials.
   Providing cooling by utilizing a green energy such as solar energy is
   the key solution to electricity and pollution problems. Adsorption
   refrigeration systems that are driven by solar energy are mature
   technologies. They are proven to be suitable and applicable for
   refrigeration as well as air-conditioning applications. Solar adsorption
   cooling technology is divided into physisorption and chemisorption
   systems. The physisorption machines include open and closed cycle
   operation. This paper presents a review on previous researches and
   developments of the solar driven closed physisorption refrigeration
   systems. The discussion includes, experimental and numerical simulation
   studies as well as methods that are suggested to improve the system

Journal = {{ENERGY \& FUELS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{The effect of the surfactant, NaOH, and polymer and the interactions
   between them on the heavy oil/water interface are unveiled by studying
   the dynamic interfacial tension (IFT), minimal transient IFT, and total
   organic carbon (TOC) and analyzing the phenomenon during the measurement
   of IFT of heavy oil/different alkaline systems, including alkaline (A),
   alkaline-surfactant (AS), alkaline-polymer (AP), and
   alkaline-surfactant-polymer (ASP). The results show that there exists a
   minimum transient IFT. There is an optimal composition to achieve the
   minimal IFT with varying NaOH concentrations in 0.018-0.8 wt \%. For
   different chemical solutions, the optimal composition is different.
   Adding polymer affects the IFT by influencing the diffusion of species
   to or from the interface. Despite polymer addition, adding surfactant
   will increase the IFT at a lower alkaline concentration because of its
   competitive adsorption with OH- and reduce the IFT at a higher alkaline
   concentration because of its synergistic effect. The synergy between the
   surfactant and alkaline is turned out as follows: NaOH reacts with the
   polar components in the oil phase to produce ionized surface-active
   species; then the IFT is reduced; and the oil drop is prolonged.
   Surfactant accelerates the diffusion of ionized species from the
   interface to the bulk phase, and then the polar components underneath it
   are exposed to NaOH; therefore, the reaction between NaOH and polar oil
   components can proceed to further reduce the IFT. The contraction of the
   oil drop after surface-active species departed can be explained
   reasonably by considering the influence of the composition and structure
   of heavy oil.}},

   with ratiometric emission at 510 nm. To attenuate excitation wavelengths
   in the UV region and transmit emission light at 510 nm, benzophenone-8
   absorption dye was selected as it exhibits high attenuation across 300
   to 400 nm. Measurements on the PVAcB-8 filter revealed an attenuation of
   approximately two and a half orders of magnitude, which is sufficient to
   collect fluorescence signal from fura-2 AM loaded neurons. The PVAcB-8

Title = {{The superposition principle applied to grasping an object producing

Abstract = {{The superposition principle suggests that motor commands can be divided
   into individually controlled components that summate to produce complex
   motor actions. Previous studies have examined the validity of this
   principle in human grasping by changing moments acting on an object
   about a single anatomically-defined axis and asking subjects to hold the
   object while their forearm was constrained. Superposition was reflected
   as separate control of the grip force and moments required to prevent
   object slip and maintain orientation. The objective of this study was to
   examine the robustness of this principle by: 1) expanding the range of
   tasks to include those where moments act on an object with respect to
   moment arms not necessarily in line with the anatomically-defined axes;
   2) asking subjects to hold the object in an unconstrained manner. Ten
   subjects were asked to lift and hold an object vertically under eighteen
   moment conditions. Force and moment data from all digits were analysed
   using principal components analysis (PCA). Different PCAs were run for
   variable sets corresponding to moments about the long axis of the
   forearm (M-x), the vertical (M-y) and grip (M-z) axes, and for the
   entire dataset (M-3D). The PCA showed grip force and moment variables on
   separate PCs for the M-x, M-y, and M-3D variable sets. The M-3D PCA also
   showed a separation of variables corresponding to moments about each
   anatomically-defined axis. Thus, the present results show that the
   superposition principle holds during natural manipulation of an object
   experiencing external moments outside the anatomically-defined axes. (C)

Abstract = {{Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) by alkaline flooding for conventional oils
   has been extensively studied. For heavy oils, investigations are very
   limited due to the unfavorable mobility ratio between the water and oil
   phases. In this study, the displacement mechanisms of alkaline flooding
   for heavy oil EOR are investigated by conducting flood tests in a
   micromodel. Two different displacement mechanisms are observed for
   enhancing heavy oil recovery. One is in situ water-in-oil (W/O) emulsion
   formation and partial wettability alteration. The W/O emulsion formed
   during the injection of alkaline solution plugs high permeability water
   channels, and pore walls are altered to become partially oil-wetted,
   leading to an improvement in sweep efficiency and high tertiary oil
   recovery. The other mechanism is the formation of an oil-in-water (O/W)
   emulsion. Heavy oil is dispersed into the water phase by injecting an
   alkaline solution containing a very dilute surfactant. The oil is then
   entrained in the water phase and flows out of the model with the water
   phase. (C) 2011 Chinese Society of Particuology and Institute of Process

Abstract = {{Multifractured horizontal wells are currently the most popular method
   for exploiting low-permeability tight and shale gas reservoirs.
   Production data analysis is the most widely used tool for analyzing
   these reservoirs for the purpose of reserves estimation, hydraulic
   fracture stimulation optimization, and development planning (Ambrose et
   al. 2011). However, as pointed out by Clarkson et al. (2012), a
   fundamental problem with the application of conventional production data
   analysis to ultralow permeability reservoirs is that current methods
   were derived with the assumption that flow can be described with Darcy's
   law. This assumption may not be valid for tight/shale gas reservoirs, as
   they contain a wide distribution of pore sizes, including in some cases
   nanopores (Loucks et al. 2009). Therefore, the mean-free path of gas
   molecules may be comparable to or larger than the average effective rock
   pore throat radius, causing the gas molecules to slip along pore
   surfaces. This results in slippage non-Darcy flow, which is not
   accounted for in conventional production data analysis.
   Clarkson et al. (2012) modified the pseudovariables used for analyzing
   gas reservoirs in production data analysis to account for slippage. They
   demonstrated that if the effect of slippage is not considered, it leads
   to noticeable errors in reservoir characterization. Clarkson et al.
   (2012) also mentioned that even after using the modified
   pseudovariables, the values for permeability and fracture half-length do
   not exactly match the input data to simulation. In this paper, a
   methodology to properly analyze the production data from a fractured
   well in a tight/shale gas reservoir producing under a constant flowing
   pressure in the presence of desorption and slippage is presented. This
   method uses a new pseudotime definition instead of the conventional
   pseudotime currently being used in production data analysis. The method
   is validated using a number of numerically simulated cases. It is found
   that the newly developed analytical method results in a more reliable
   estimate of fracture half-length or contacted matrix surface area, if
   permeability is known.}},

   Reservoirs: Constant-Flowing-Pressure Boundary Condition}},

Abstract = {{Many tight/shale gas wells exhibit linear flow, which can last for
   several years. Linear flow can be analyzed using a square-root-of-time
   plot, a plot of rate-normalized pressure vs. the square root of time.
   Linear flow appears as a straight line on this plot, and the slope of
   this line can be used to calculate the product of fracture half-length
   and the square root of permeability.
   In this paper, linear flow from a fractured well in a tight/shale gas
   reservoir under a constant-flowing-pressure constraint is studied. It is
   shown that the slope of the square-root-of-time plot results in an
   overestimation of fracture half-length, if permeability is known. The
   degree of this overestimation is influenced by initial pressure, flowing
   pressure, and formation compressibility. An analytical method is
   presented to correct the slope of the square-root-of-time plot to
   improve the overestimation of fracture half-length. The method is
   validated using a number of numerically simulated cases. As expected,
   the square-root-of-time plots for these simulated cases appear as a
   straight line during linear flow for constant flowing pressure. It is
   found that the newly developed analytical method results in a more
   reliable estimate of fracture half-length, if permeability is known. Our
   approach, which is fully analytical, results in an improvement in
   linear-flow analysis over previously presented methods. Finally, the
   application of this method to multifractured horizontal wells is
   discussed and the method is applied to three field examples.}},

Abstract = {{An algebraic integer (AI)-based time-multiplexed row-parallel
   architecture and two final reconstruction step (FRS) algorithms are
   proposed for the implementation of bivariate AI-encoded 2-D discrete
   cosine transform (DCT). The architecture directly realizes an error-free
   2-D DCT without using FRSs between row-column transforms, leading to an
   8 x 8 2-D DCT that is entirely free of quantization errors in AI basis.
   As a result, the user-selectable accuracy for each of the coefficients
   in the FRS facilitates each of the 64 coefficients to have its precision
   set independently of others, avoiding the leakage of quantization noise
   between channels as is the case for published DCT designs. The proposed
   FRS uses two approaches based on: 1) optimized Dempster-Macleod
   multipliers, and 2) expansion factor scaling. This architecture enables
   low-noise high-dynamic range applications in digital video processing
   that requires full control of the finite-precision computation of the
   2-D DCT. The proposed architectures and FRS techniques are
   experimentally verified and validated using hardware implementations
   that are physically realized and verified on field-programmable gate
   array (FPGA) chip. Six designs, for 4-bit and 8-bit input word sizes,
   using the two proposed FRS schemes, have been designed, simulated,
   physically implemented, and measured. The maximum clock rate and block
   rate achieved among 8-bit input designs are 307.787 MHz and 38.47 MHz,
   respectively, implying a pixel rate of 8 x 307.787 approximate to 2.462
   GHz if eventually embedded in a real-time video-processing system. The
   equivalent frame rate is about 1187.35 Hz for the image size of 1920 x
   1080. All implementations are functional on a Xilinx Virtex-6 XC6VLX240T
   FPGA device.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical design methodology of outphasing amplification systems is
   proposed using new simplified analytical expressions for the
   instantaneous efficiency and the input/output voltages of Chireix
   outphasing combiners. These expressions are derived first for ideal
   voltage sources with nonzero internal impedance and later for ideal
   Class-B amplifiers where dc current variation is incorporated. They take
   into account the impedance mismatch between the amplifiers and the
   lossless combining structure and account explicitly for the all of the
   combiner's electrical parameters. We show that the maximum achievable
   instantaneous combining efficiency can be controlled in position and in
   value through the judicious choice of the combiner's stub length and
   transmission-line characteristic impedance. We further show that, when
   this choice is combined with the amplified signal's distribution, the
   average combining efficiency can be precisely controlled and easily
   maximized. Various validations of the proposed expressions are performed
   by comparison with experimental and simulation results for various

Abstract = {{Subject motion during high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed
   tomography (HR-pQCT) causes image artifacts that affect morphological
   analysis of bone quality. The aim of our study was to determine
   effectiveness of techniques for quality control in the presence of
   motion in vivo including automated and manual approaches. First,
   repeatability of manual grading was determined within and between
   laboratories. Given proper training using a standardized scale and
   training images (provided by the manufacturer), we found that manual
   grading is suitable for repeatable image quality grading within and
   across sites (ICC>0.7). Both a new automated technique providing motion
   measures based on projection moments, and traditional manual grading (1
   = best, 5 = worst) were subsequently used to assess subject data for
   motion in N = 137 image pairs (scan/re-scan) from the Canadian
   Multicentre Osteoporosis Study (CaMos) Calgary cohort. High quality
   image pairs were selected and measurement precision was estimated by
   calculating the coefficient of variation (CV). Consistent with previous
   data, density parameters (e.g. total bone mineral density) are more
   robust than structural (e.g. trabecular number) or finite element
   parameters (e.g. failure load). To obtain acceptable measurement
   precision, images should not exceed a manual grading of 3 (on a scale
   from 1 to 5) or an automatic (epsilon(T)) grading of 1.2. Automatic and
   manual grading provide comparable quality control, but the advantage of
   the automated technique is its ability to provide a motion value at scan
   time (providing a basis for real time decision regarding re-scan
   requirements), and the assessment is objective. Notably, automatic
   motion measurement can be performed retrospectively based on original
   scan data, and is therefore well suited for multi-center studies as well
   as any research where objective quality control is paramount. (C) 2012

Journal = {{CORROSION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{103-109}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In this work, the effect of uniaxial elastic stress on corrosion of X100
   pipeline steel in a near-neutral pH solution was investigated by
   localized electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (LEIS), corrosion
   potential and electrochemical impedance measurements, surface analysis
   techniques as well as finite element analysis. No effect of the static
   elastic stress on electrochemical corrosion potential of the steel is
   detected. The critical failure strain of corrosion scale formed on the
   steel surface is calculated to be 0.00357-0.00417, which is higher than
   the maximum strain of 0.0029 generated on the specimen. Thus, corrosion
   scale does not fracture during loading. No difference in the
   steady-state corrosion potential could be detected upon application of
   an elastic tensile or compressive stress. If the scale is pre-formed on
   the steel surface, the applied dynamic elastic load would ``weaken{''}
   the scale by expanding its pores, and thus, increase the steel
   corrosion. While a dynamic tensile stress enhances the steel corrosion,
   the dynamic compressive stress would inhibit corrosion of the steel.
   This work provides important recommendations for pipeline safety design,
   where the corrosion enhancement due to the dynamic elastic stress should
   be considered. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The bonding temperature is an important parameter for optimization of
   the Transient Liquid Phase (TLP) bonding process in order to achieve a
   sound joint with good mechanical properties. However, the bonding
   temperature used can also be restricted by the microstructural stability
   of the base metal. In this study, the effect of bonding temperature
   (1050-1200 degrees C) on the joint microstructure and mechanical
   properties was studied for TLP bonding of FSX-414 superalloy using
   MBF-80 interlayer with thickness of 50 mu m.
   Increasing bonding temperature from 1050 to 1150 degrees C caused
   reduction in the time required for complete isothermal solidification in
   agreement with models based on the diffusion induced solid/liquid
   interface motion. But even after 120 min hold time at 1200 degrees C,
   isothermal solidification was not complete and significant liquid
   penetration at grain boundaries adjacent to the joints was observed.
   Heating the base metal specimens to various temperatures of 1160-1190
   degrees C and then water quenching, showed that 1190 degrees C is the
   critical temperature for base metal liquefaction.
   The maximum hardness at isothermal solidification zone and maximum
   hardness of phases at joint and diffusion affected zone was increased
   and decreased, respectively, with increasing temperature up to 1150
   degrees C. Also, the shear strength at complete isothermal
   solidification was increased at the same trend. But a significant
   reduction in shear strength and maximum ISZ hardness were observed for
   sample bonded at 1200 C. Separated bond-line and fracture surface and
   also cleavage-like features were seen at fracture surface of shear
   tested samples for this temperature which are evidences of brittle
   fracture. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Increased toughness of epoxy coincided with a reduction of tensile

   superior stiffness and slight improvement in tensile strength while

Abstract = {{In future smart grids, consumers of electricity will be enabled to react
   to electricity prices. The aggregate reaction of consumers can
   potentially shift the demand curve in the market, resulting in prices
   that may differ from the initial forecasts. In this paper, a hybrid
   forecasting framework is proposed that takes such dynamics into account
   when forecasting electricity price and demand. The proposed framework
   combines a multi-input multioutput (MIMO) forecasting engine for joint
   price and demand prediction with data association mining (DAM)
   algorithms. In this framework, a DAM-based rule extraction mechanism is
   used to determine and extract the patterns in consumers' reaction to
   price forecasts. The extracted rules are then employed to fine-tune the
   initially generated demand and price forecasts of a MIMO engine.
   Simulation results are presented using Australia's and New England's

Abstract = {{Forecasting electricity prices plays a significant role in making

   Predominantly, price forecasting is performed from a ``point

   management, operation decisions are made based on certain price
   thresholds. It is, hence, desirable to obtain the ``classes{''} of
   future prices, which can be cast as an electricity price classification
   problem. In this paper, we investigate the application and effectiveness
   of several data mining approaches for electricity market price
   classification. In addition, we propose a new data model for forming the
   initial data set for price classification. Simulation results for New
   York, Ontario, and Alberta electricity market prices are provided.
   Finally, the application of the generated numerical results to a
   demand-side management case study is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{A high and low light imager (HALLI) developed in a CMOS process is
   presented. The HALLI utilizes a single column parallel partitioned pixel
   amplifier with variable topology for the detection of both high and low
   light levels in the same frame. For high light level detection, a wide
   dynamic range algorithm is utilized in which multiple resets via
   real-time feedback are employed. Each pixel in the field of view is
   independent and can automatically set its exposure time according to its
   illumination. For low light level detection, two noise reduction
   techniques are employed, active reset and active column sensor readout
   technique. Due to the commonalities in the high and low light level
   readout techniques, and the fact that they occur in staggered instances
   of time, a single partitioned pixel amplifier which can be configured in
   various modes of operation is used. The advantages of using a single
   column parallel partitioned pixel amplifier are simplicity in the analog
   readout path, reduced chip size, and lower power consumption than using
   individual dedicated blocks for each technique. The CMOS imager was
   designed and fabricated in a mixed signal 0.18 mu m CMOS technology.
   System architecture, operation and results are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can provide an important source
   of cells for the next-generation of cell therapies in regenerative
   medicine, in part due to their similarity to embryonic stem cells
   (ESCs). Patient-specific iPSCs represent an opportunity for autologous
   cell therapies that are not restricted by immunological, ethical and
   technical obstacles. One of the technical hurdles that must be overcome
   before iPSCs can be clinically implemented is the scalable, reproducible
   production of iPSCs and their differentiated progeny. All of the iPSC
   lines established thus far have been generated and expanded with static
   tissue culture protocols, which are time-consuming and suffer from
   batch-to-batch variability. Alternatively, stirred suspension
   bioreactors propose several benefits and their homogeneous culture
   environment facilitates the large-scale expansion required for clinical
   studies at less cost. We have previously developed protocols for
   expanding murine and human ESCs as undifferentiated aggregates in
   stirred suspension bioreactors. The resulting cells were karyotypically
   normal, expressed pluripotency markers and could be differentiated into
   all three germ lineages, both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we
   demonstrate that stirred suspension bioreactors yield 58-fold expansion
   of undifferentiated pluripotent iPSCs over 4 days. In vitro
   differentiation into cartilage, bone and cardiomyocytes lineages, in
   addition to in vivo teratoma formation, further confirmed the existence
   of fully functional and undifferentiated pluripotent iPSC aggregates
   following long-term passaging. Stirred suspension bioreactor culture
   represents an efficient process for the large-scale expansion and
   maintenance of iPSCs, which is an important first step in their clinical
   application. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Reliable wireless communication is a key component for intelligent
   transportation systems (ITS). This paper develops a wireless module for
   ITS using an AR7100 series embedding platform. The module consists of a
   low-cost multi-interface wireless mesh and control unit to provide high
   quality of services for different applications. It acts as a node in a
   vehicular wireless network with a pure software extension without costly
   hardware modifications. The developed system was tested in the urban
   area of the Wuhan city, China. It is observed that the fast fading
   effect plays a significant role in the performance of vehicular
   communications. To characterize these effects, a physical-level model of
   the radio link between two moving vehicles is proposed. This model takes
   the impacts of Rician K-factor, vehicle speed ratio, and Doppler
   spectrum into consideration. Compared with the existing physical models,
   the proposed physical-level model is shown to be more accurate in
   describing the packet-level characteristics of vehicle communications.
   Furthermore, the analysis of the proposed physical level model indicates
   the necessity of cross-layer design of vehicular wireless networks.}},

Abstract = {{Petroleum coke (petcoke) is an abundant resource that can potentially be
   converted to catalyst support materials through activation to increase
   the surface area and reduce the sulphur content. In this work, potassium
   hydroxide (KOH) catalysed activation was employed with petcoke to
   produce activated carbons, which were characterised with nitrogen
   physisorption, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and
   temperature-programmed reduction. With activation temperatures between
   500 and 800 degrees C, the surface area increased from 4?m2/g to between
   200 and 2400?m2/g while the sulphur content was reduced from 6.6?wt\% to
   between 1 and 0.2?wt\%. Nickel catalysts (nominally 5?wt\%) were
   prepared on the activated carbon supports using wet impregnation. The
   activities of these catalysts were measured for toluene hydrogenation in
   a plug-flow reactor with a toluene liquid hourly space velocity of
   2.4/h, a pressure of 1.38?MPa, and a H2/toluene mole ratio of 90. The
   catalytic activity varied between zero for nickel supported on petcoke
   to 98\% conversion, with essentially 100\% to methylcyclohexane for
   nickel supported on carbon activated at 750 degrees C. Thus, activated
   carbon from petcoke was a suitable support for Ni-based catalysts when

Abstract = {{The classical method for surface characterisation of the porous

   more information about the materials, catalyst surfaces can be
   characterised using fractal geometry. The fractal dimension of a sample
   can be determined by the adsorption uptake of molecules of different
   sizes on the surface of interest in order to obtain a characteristic

Abstract = {{In this paper, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for
   time-based range estimation (TBRE) in a separable multipath channel is
   investigated and analyzed with respect to its accuracy. First, the
   Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) in a separable multipath channel is
   theoretically derived, and indicates a similar expression to that for a
   single path channel. The CRLB for non-data-bearing (NDB) OFDM
   transmission is compared to that for pseudo-noise (PN) transmission,
   demonstrating a large performance gap in favor of the NDB OFDM.
   Furthermore, the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for TBRE in a
   separable multipath channel is theoretically derived, also demonstrating
   a similar expression to that in a single path channel, except that
   several peaks instead of one peak are expected in a separable multipath
   channel corresponding to all arrival paths. The MLE for TBRE is then
   compared to the commonly used MLE for channel estimation, showing an
   equal performance in terms of mean square error when using an NDB OFDM
   transmission. Simulation results demonstrate a good agreement with our
   proposed theory.}},

   identification experiment is discussed. The proposed estimation
   methodology is validated experimentally. An index to quantify the
   quality of the system input signal in contrast with the designed
   perturbation signal is proposed. In addition, an operation region in the
   generator capability curve, high active power and absorbing reactive
   power, where the identification experiment produces better
   identification results is located. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   transient liquid phase bonded magnesium AZ31 alloy}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{38}},
Pages = {{32-37}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The transient liquid phase (TLP) bonding of a magnesium alloy AZ31 was
   undertaken using pure nickel interlayers. The formation of a eutectic
   between the magnesium and nickel was obtained by bonding at 515 degrees
   C and the microstructural developments across the joint region were
   examined as a function of hold time from 5 to 120 min. Reaction zones
   were identified within the joint and the changes of width of the
   reaction zones were examined with respect to changes in the joint shear
   strength and hardness. The results showed that as the bonding time was
   increased to 60 min, the width of the eutectic zone was completely
   removed and the joint solidified isothermally. Under these conditions a
   maximum hardness value of 179 VHN was recorded and the highest joint
   shear strength of 36 MPa was obtained. However, when the bonding time
   was increased to 120 min, the shear strength of the interface decreased
   and this was attributed to the formation and segregation of brittle
   Mg-Ni intermetallics within the joint. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates a comprehensive 3D nonlinear Finite Element (FE)
   analysis of Reinforced Concrete (RC) beams strengthened with prestressed
   Near-Surface Mounted (NSM) Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP)
   strips. Debonding effect at the epoxy-concrete interface was considered
   in the model by identification of fracture energies of the interfaces
   and appropriate bilinear shear stress-slip and tension stress-gap
   models. Prestressing was applied to the CFRP strips by adopting the
   equivalent temperature method. A constitutive confined concrete model
   for flexural member was generated from unconfined concrete curve and
   assigned to the concrete materials. The results from the FE model were
   validated with experimental data available in the literature. Comparison
   between FE and test results confirms excellent accuracy of the proposed
   model. An optimum prestressing level in the NSM-CFRP strips was
   determined that enhances the beam performance under service and ultimate
   loads by maintaining the amount of energy absorption in the strengthened
   beam equal to the un-strengthened control beam. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Month = {{MAY 25}},
Abstract = {{The Expanded Fluid (EF) viscosity correlation was used to model the
   viscosity of mixtures commonly encountered in natural gas processing.
   This correlation provides viscosity values as a function of fluid
   density and characterizes each pure compound with three fluid-specific
   parameters: c(2), rho(o)(s) and c(3), when using experimental densities
   (Version 1) and two parameters, c(2) and rho(o)(s), when using a cubic
   equation of state (Version 2). In particular, the original EF
   correlation for hydrocarbons was adapted for non-hydrocarbon components,
   including: carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen, helium, water,
   methanol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol and triethylene glycol. A
   temperature dependency was introduced for parameter c(2) for components
   with significant hydrogen bonding such as water and methanol. For all
   other components, a fixed c(2) was found to be adequate. Both versions
   of the correlation were fit to experimental data for the non-hydrocarbon
   components with overall average absolute relative deviation (AARD) below
   6\%. The viscosities of several sweet and sour natural gas mixtures were
   predicted with overall AARDs of 6.3\% and 5.1\% for Versions 1 and 2,
   respectively. The viscosities of aqueous solutions both of methanol and
   of glycols were also modeled. A binary interaction parameter was
   required to fit the data for all aqueous mixtures in Version 2 but only
   for mixtures of water and methanol in Version 1. The overall AARDs of
   the calculated viscosities of the aqueous solutions of methanol and
   glycols by Versions 1 and 2 were 6\% and 8.7\%, respectively. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Traditional dual porosity models do not take into account the effect of

   of the advective-diffusive mass transport in fractured porous media by
   identifying two early and late time periods of mass transfer. Results
   show that fractured rock matrix block size distribution has a great
   impact on mass transfer during early time period. In addition, two
   dimensionless shape factors are obtained for the late time, which depend
   on the injection flow rate and the distance of the rock matrix from the

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with a theoretical question as to the definition
   of instabilities in a granular assembly and its proper formulation at
   the microscopic level. Recently, this question has taken up much
   prominence with the emergence of intriguing failure modes such as
   diffuse failure associated to unstable plasticity of granular materials
   and microstructural instabilities. An analysis of the second-order work
   as a general and necessary criterion to detect instabilities is
   conducted both at the macroscopic and microscopic levels including large
   deformations. On the basis of a micromechanical analysis of a body
   consisting of arbitrary interacting particles in a representative
   element volume (REV), a general formula is derived to quantify the
   microscopic second-order work involving local variables on the grain
   scale. The latter emerges as a sum of a configurational term that
   involves contact forces between neighboring grains, plus a kinetic part
   consisting of the mechanical unbalance of intergranular forces under
   dynamics at incipient failure. The present analysis is thought to serve
   as a clarification of the question of failure in geomaterials typified
   by a transition from static to a dynamic regime with release of kinetic
   energy originating from microstructural interactions. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Title = {{High-Frequency, Low-Magnitude Vibration Does Not Prevent Bone Loss
   Resulting from Muscle Disuse in Mice following Botulinum Toxin Injection}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 10}},
Abstract = {{High-frequency, low-magnitude vibration enhances bone formation
   ostensibly by mimicking normal postural muscle activity. We tested this
   hypothesis by examining whether daily exposure to low-magnitude
   vibration (VIB) would maintain bone in a muscle disuse model with
   botulinum toxin type A (BTX). Female 16-18 wk old BALB/c mice (N = 36)
   were assigned to BTX-VIB, BTX-SHAM, VIB, or SHAM. BTX mice were injected
   with BTX (20 mu L; 1 U/100 g body mass) into the left hindlimb posterior
   musculature. All mice were anaesthetized for 20 min/d, 5 d/wk, for 3 wk,
   and the left leg mounted to a holder. Through the holder, VIB mice
   received 45 Hz, =0.6 g sinusoidal acceleration without weight bearing.
   SHAM mice received no vibration. At baseline and 3 wk, muscle
   cross-sectional area (MCSA) and tibial bone properties (epiphysis,
   metaphysis and diaphysis) were assessed by in vivo micro-CT. Bone volume
   fraction in the metaphysis decreased 12 +/- 9\% and 7 +/- 6\% in BTX-VIB
   and BTX-SHAM, but increased in the VIB and SHAM. There were no
   differences in dynamic histomorphometry outcomes between BTX-VIB and BTX
   nor between VIB and SHAM. Thus, vibration did not prevent bone loss
   induced by a rapid decline in muscle activity nor produce an anabolic
   effect in normal mice. The daily loading duration was shorter than would
   be expected from postural muscle activity, and may have been
   insufficient to prevent bone loss. Based on the approach used in this
   study, vibration does not prevent bone loss in the absence of muscle
   activity induced by BTX.}},

Abstract = {{in Alberta and British Columbia, a huge amount of tight gas is trapped
   in relatively low-permeability rock formations. Physical fracturing of
   these formations could enhance the overall formation permeability and
   thus improve tight gas extraction. One of the outstanding issues in rock
   fracturing is to determine the magnitude of applied effective stress.
   The general effective-stress law ;is defined as sigma(eff) = sigma(c) -
   alpha sigma(p), where sigma(c) and sigma(p) are total confining stress
   and fluid pore pressure, respectively. Each physical quantity of rock
   responds to total stress and pore pressure in a different way, and thus
   each quantity has its own unique Biot's effective-stress coefficient.
   The main objective of this study is to experimentally determine the
   Biot's coefficient for permeability of Nikanassin sandstone. A series of
   permeability measurements was conducted on Nikanassin sandstone core
   samples from the Lick Creek region in British Columbia under various
   combinations of confining stress and pore pressure. In addition,
   permeability values were measured both along and across bedding planes
   to investigate any anisotropy in the Biot's coefficient.}},

Abstract = {{The fatigue performance of Reinforced Concrete (RC) beams strengthened
   using prestressed Near Surface Mounted (NSM) Carbon Fiber Reinforced
   Polymer (CFRP) strips was evaluated in this paper. Five full-scale RC
   beams were tested under fatigue loading simulating in-service loading
   conditions: one control unstrengthened beam and four beams strengthened
   using NSM-CFRP strips prestressed to 0, 20, 40, and 60\% of the CFRP
   ultimate tensile strength. All beams were subjected to fatigue loading
   for 3 million cycles at a frequency of 2.0 Hz such that the stress range
   induced in the tension steel, during the initial cycle, is 125 MPa as
   specified by the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code. Experimental test
   results show that the percentage deflection increase at the end of
   fatigue loading was almost the same for all beams, which implies that
   damage accumulation is independent from the prestress level. CFRP strain
   variation at midspan indicated the occurrence of deboning during the
   initial cycling of beams prestressed to 0 and 20\%, whereas no signs of
   bond degradation were observed in the other beams. Therefore,
   prestressing the CFRP strips was shown to enhance the bonding properties
   and results in an overall CFRP strain increase at the completion of the
   fatigue loading. For all beams, steel and concrete strains and crack
   widths at midspan increased rapidly in the initial 500 cycles, followed
   by stabilized linear increase trends for the rest of the fatigue
   loading. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CC.1943-5614.0000262. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{Objective: To compare larger diameter corkscrew-tined leads with
   previously described intracardiac pacing leads for temporary gastric
   neurostimulation in a canine model. Materials and Methods: Two mongrel
   dogs underwent gastroscopy under general anesthesia, with endoscopic
   placement of two cardiac leads (1 mm tine diameter, 4 mm depth) placed
   sequentially in 1) transverse configuration in the distal antrum mucosa;
   2) longitudinal (1 cm apart) configuration in gastric corpus. Stomach
   was then stimulated with maximal parameters to induce neutrally mediated
   contraction. Procedures were then repeated with larger leads (5 mm tine
   diameter, 8 mm length). Gastric contractions were measured with serosal
   strain transducers. Results: Leads were placed endoscopically without
   difficulty. Neither lead type punctured through to the serosa of the
   stomach. Neither cardiac nor larger leads were capable of eliciting any
   gastric contractile activity with endoscopic placement either in the
   transverse or longitudinal orientations. Discussion: While successful on
   the serosal side, both the cardiac leads and the larger alternative
   leads failed to produce stomach contraction when implanted mucosally.
   This may be due to the elastic nature of the mucosa, which was observed
   to twist around both types of leads significantly, hindering proper
   penetration into the muscularis. Conclusion: These results suggest that
   the current concept of temporary gastric electrical neurostimulation via
   a mucosal approach must be reevaluated, as the procedure most likely
   does not accurately mimic electrical stimulation in the muscularis.}},

Abstract = {{Computed tomography (CT) scanning is one of the viable techniques to
   evaluate apertures of rough walled fractures. However, quantitative
   evaluation of small fracture apertures using CT data requires use of
   calibration curves. In this study, the increments of fracture apertures
   were physically measured using the DEMEC points and the integrated CT
   numbers across the fracture aperture were calculated from the CT data
   for development of the calibration chart. This method overcomes the
   difficulty in fabrication of perfectly smooth rock fractures for the
   calibration process. It was demonstrated that the calibration curve
   developed from this method could be used to characterize variable
   aperture fractures in sandstone within a certain accuracy. In addition,
   geostatistic tools were used to quantify any anisotropy in fracture
   aperture. Results reveal that the induced fracture in sandstone displays
   a high aperture variation and undulation with an anisotropy in aperture

Abstract = {{Range cameras offer great potential for the measurement of structural
   deformations because of their ability to directly measure video
   sequences of three-dimensional coordinates of entire surfaces, their
   compactness, and their relatively low cost compared with other active
   imaging technologies such as terrestrial laser scanners. Identified
   limitations of range cameras for high-precision metrology applications
   such as deformation measurement include the high (centimeter level)
   noise level and scene-dependent errors. This paper proposes models and
   methodologies to overcome these limitations and reports on the use of a
   SwissRanger SR4000 range camera for the measurement of deflections in
   concrete beams subjected to flexural load-testing. Results from three
   separate tests show that submillimeter precision and accuracy-assessed
   by comparison with estimates derived from terrestrial laser scanner
   data-can be achieved. The high-accuracy range camera results were
   realized by eliminating the systematic, scene-dependent bias of internal
   scattering through measurement differencing and by reducing the
   influence of random errors with temporal and spatial filtering
   strategies. Additional experiments to validate some of the fundamental
   modeling assumptions and to explain the possible causes of residual,
   submillimeter biases in the deflection estimates are also reported. DOI:

Abstract = {{Appropriate techniques have to be developed for improving heavy oil
   recovery from thin reservoirs in western Canada, where thermal methods
   suffer from heat loss to overburden/underburden and vapor extraction
   (VAPEX) is not effective because of the lack of efficient gravity
   drainage. Considering this, a hydrocarbon gas injection process in
   huff-n-puff mode, i.e., traditional hydrocarbon-based cyclic solvent
   process (CSP), has been tested to evaluate its applicability to such
   thin reservoirs. In the first part of this study, the behavior of
   methane huff-n-puff for heavy oil recovery is investigated by conducting
   a series of CSP cycles in a sandpack saturated with crude oil (with a
   viscosity of 1080.6 cP at 22 degrees C) and brine. The results of the
   six methane CSP cycles revealed that methane huff-n-puff is inefficient.
   The problem is that, during the production cycles, the reservoir
   pressure has to be greatly reduced to realize solvent gas drive. In
   doing this, the oil regains its high viscosity, because a large fraction
   of methane evolves out of the oil. To overcome this limitation and keep
   the oil viscosity low by maintaining most of the viscosity-reducing
   solvent in oil during the production period, we examined a new process,
   enhanced cyclic solvent process (ECSP). In ECSP, two types of
   hydrocarbon solvents are cyclically injected but in two separate slugs.
   One slug is more volatile (methane), and the other is more soluble
   (propane) in the heavy oil. A series of six ECSP cycles was conducted in
   the same sandpack used in the methane huff-n-puff tests. A total
   recovery of 34.30\% original-oil-in-place (OOIP) was obtained through
   six ECSP cycles compared to 4.27\% OOIP of six methane huff-n-puff
   cycles, indicating that ECSP improves the methane huff-n-puff for the
   heavy oil recovery in thin formations.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a systematic design methodology is proposed to optimise
   the operation of Doherty power amplifiers (PAs). The proposed approach
   makes use of two sets of load-pull data to enhance the performance of
   Doherty PAs at low- and high-power-drive levels. The first load-pull,
   which is performed on the device operating at saturation, permits one to
   maximise the performance at a high-power region. The second load-pull,
   which is performed at the power level associated with the turn-on of the
   peaking amplifier, aims to boost the performance at back-off. To assess
   its effectiveness, the proposed methodology is applied to design three
   Doherty PAs sought for power efficiency, linearity and gain,
   respectively. Around the Doherty turn-on point, these circuits achieved
   up to 9\% efficiency improvement, up to 10 dB inter-modulation reduction
   and up to 2 dB gain improvement, respectively. For experimental
   validation, a gallium-nitride (GaN)-based Doherty PA prototype sought
   for efficiency was implemented. The fabricated Doherty PA demonstrated a
   power-added efficiency (PAE) higher than 40\% over an output power
   back-off (OPBO) range of 8 dB, with two peak PAE points of 52 and 62\%
   located at 6.8 dB OPBO and at saturation, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{This study discusses the implementation of a digital predistorter to
   linearise radiofrequency (RF) power amplifiers, using input signals 60
   MHz in bandwidth. The digital predistorter characterisation procedure is
   performed on a digital signal processor, using a memory polynomial
   modelling technique with QR-based recursive least squares (QR-RLS) as
   the extraction procedure. A multiple look-up table design for the memory
   polynomial predistorter is introduced, and by using fixed-point
   operations, reduces the processing latency considerably when compared
   with a floating-point-based predistorter implementation on a field
   programmable gate array (FPGA). Linearisation results are shown for a
   laterally diffused metal oxide semi-conductor (LDMOS)-based power
   amplifier (PA) biased in class AB operation with a three-carrier
   long-term evolution-time division duplex (LTE-TDD) input signal.
   Combining both the optimised predistortion coefficient extraction and
   predistorter implementation gives up to 20 dBc improvement in the
   adjacent channel and meets the wireless communication standard

Abstract = {{A systolic architecture has recently been proposed for implementing
   two-dimensional infinite impulse response (IIR) spacetime beam
   plane-wave filters at a throughput of one-frame-per-clockcycle for such
   applications as real-time broadband smart antennas. A novel polyphase
   systolic architecture is proposed here that further increases the
   throughput of these IIR beam filters, by a factor of M, to
   M-frames-per-clock-cycle, where M is the number of polyphases. The
   proposed method combines the polyphase approach, along with pipelining
   and look-ahead optimization methods, to achieve frame sample frequencies
   that are several times higher than the clock-cycle limit of the very
   large-scale integration (VLSI) technology, thereby potentially allowing
   multi-GHz frame sample frequencies using current custom VLSI circuits.
   The implementation of a field programmable gate array-based real-time
   prototype is described, tested and verified for the two-phase case (M =
   2) at a technology-limited clock frequency of 50?MHz which corresponds
   to a throughput of 100 million-frames-per-clockcycle. Copyright (c) 2010

Abstract = {{This paper describes a methodology for the measurement of the capillary
   pressure curve of dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) in a
   water-saturated sandstone induced fracture. Details of specimen
   preparation, capillary barrier design, and capillary pressure
   measurement setup, procedure, and results are given. The aperture
   distribution of the induced fracture was estimated using the X-ray
   computed tomography (CT) technique. The primary drainage or invasion of
   DNAPLs in the water-saturated induced fracture was simulated using the
   invasion percolation (IP) approach. It was found that the invasion
   process was highly dependent on the spatial distribution of the fracture
   apertures. The IP model matched the experimentally measured entry
   pressure very well but deviated from the measured capillary pressure
   curve at the midrange and high nonwetting phase saturations. The IP
   model tended to yield an L-shaped function with a fairly flat portion at
   the midrange saturation and a sharp rise at the high end. The measured
   capillary pressure curve was observed to follow the well-known
   Brooks-Corey porous media function. These discrepancies between the
   measured and predicted results could be attributed to the fact that the
   IP model did not consider the effects of fracture surface roughness and
   undulation. For a fracture with small apertures, these two factors could
   make the fracture behave more as a porous medium than a parallel-plate
   channel. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)GT.1943-5606.0000590. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{Drift and internal forces due to lateral forces on multi-storey concrete
   buildings composed of flat plates, columns, and shear walls are
   considered. For analysis, the structure should be idealized by a model
   composed of all monolithic components: shear walls, slabs, and columns.
   All components affecting the structure's stiffness should be considered
   in design; this is required by codes. However, for seismic design, codes
   allow, as alternative, a lateral force-resisting system composed of the
   shear walls only, but require that the design for the moment and the
   shearing force, transferred between the column and the slab, be based on
   the calculated drift. The study in this paper shows that this
   alternative can greatly overestimate the drift, the unbalanced moments
   transferred between the columns and the slabs and the bending moments on
   the shear walls. The design forces depend upon the natural period of
   vibration, whose value would be overestimated by ignoring the
   contribution of the slabs and columns to the stiffness of the structure.
   This paper recommends that the design be based on the analysis of a
   structural model composed of the shear walls, the slabs, and the
   columns; the paper also gives guidance on the design of flexural and
   punching shear reinforcements in the slabs.}},

   hydraulic models of the 3-element Windkessel. To test the validity of
   our P-reservoir determinations, we studied a freeware simulation of the
   electrical model and a benchtop recreation of the hydraulic model,
   respectively, measuring the voltage and the pressure distal to the
   proximal resistance. These measurements were then compared with
   P-reservoir, as calculated from physiological data. Thus, the first
   objective of this study was to demonstrate that respective voltage and
   pressure changes could be measured that were similar to calculated
   physiological values of P-reservoir. The second objective was to confirm
   previous predictions with respect to the specific effects of
   systematically altering proximal resistance, distal resistance, and
   capacitance. The results of this study validate P-reservoir and, thus,
   the reservoir-wave approach.}},

Abstract = {{The shedding process in the near wake of a surface-mounted, square
   cross-section cylinder of height-to-width aspect ratio 4 at a Reynolds
   number of 12,000 based on free-stream velocity and the obstacle width
   was investigated. The boundary layer thickness was 0.18 obstacle heights
   based on 99\% free-stream velocity. The study is performed using planar
   high frame-rate particle image velocimetry synchronized with pressure
   measurements and hot-wire anemometry. Spatial cross-correlation,
   instantaneous phase relationships, and phase-averaged velocity data are
   reported. Two dominant vortex-shedding regimes are observed. During
   intervals of high-amplitude pressure fluctuations on the obstacle side
   faces, alternate formation and shedding of vortices is observed (regime
   A) similar to the von Karman process. Regime B is characterized by two
   co-existing vortices in the obstacle lee throughout the shedding cycle
   and is observed within low-amplitude pressure fluctuation intervals.
   Despite the coexisting vortices in the base region, opposite sign
   vorticity is still shed out-of-phase downstream of this vortex pair
   giving rise to a staggered arrangement of counter-rotating vortices
   downstream. While the probability of occurrence of Regime B increases
   toward the free end, the amplitude modulation remains coherent along the
   obstacle height. Conditionally phase-averaged reconstructions of the
   flow field are consistent with the spatial distribution of the phase
   relationships and their probability density function. Earlier
   observations are reconciled showing that the symmetric shedding of
   vortices is a rare occurrence.}},

Abstract = {{Technical books of each subject area denote the level of maturity and

   about 208 Unified Modeling Language (UML) books have been published from
   its inception in 1997 until 2009. While various book reviews are
   frequently published in various sources (e.g., IEEE Software Bookshelf),
   there are no studies to classify UML books into meaningful categories.
   Such a classification can help researchers in the area to identify
   trends and also reveal the level of activity in each sub-area of UML.
   The statistical survey reported in this article intends to be a first
   step in classification and trend analysis of the UML books published
   from 1997 to 2009. The study also sheds light on the quantity of books
   published in different focus areas (e.g., UML's core concepts, patterns,
   tool support, Object Constraint Language and Model-Driven Architecture)
   and also on different application domains (e.g., database modeling, web

Abstract = {{When approximating dynamic systems with Laguerre basis functions (LBFs)
   it is important to tune the Laguerre pole such that the expansion can be
   both parsimonious and accurate. Expressing the sum of squared errors
   (SSE) as a function of the Laguerre pole leads to an objective function
   that has many local minima and therefore cannot be optimized directly.
   Two alternative methods have been proposed in the literature: an
   asymptotically optimal method, and the enforced convergence criterion
   (ECC). In this paper, a generalization of the ECC will be investigated
   such that in the limit minimizing this generalized ECC and computing the
   asymptotically optimal solution lead to the same Laguerre pole.
   Moreover, it will be proved that these generalized ECCs are quasiconvex
   functions which means they can be efficiently minimized using numerical
   optimization techniques. The concept of operator quasiconvexity is
   investigated and used to prove quasiconvexity of the ECC.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an adaptive haptic control for a one
   degree-of-freedom master-slave teleoperated device. The aim is to reduce
   excessive collision forces that occur when there are significant time
   delays in master-slave communication. The control design also allows the
   operator to move the slave in free space and in a soft medium. Previous
   approaches to haptic teleoperation typically design for either movement
   in a medium or constrained contact with a solid surface; then, it is up
   to the operator to avoid collisions or precisely anticipate collisions.
   The proposed control runs on the slave side inner loop, with no time
   delay, and tracks commanded forces from the outer loop. A
   Lyapunov-stable backstepping-with-tuning-functions design provides a way
   to ensure smooth forces are applied that guarantee stability in the
   presence of unmodeled environmental stiffness and viscosity. Experiments
   using a Phantom hand controller interacting with simulated environment
   show that collision forces are substantially reduced compared to two
   other control methods. In collision-free operation, the performance is
   comparable to other methods.}},

Abstract = {{Most oil pumping units (OPUs) have been using manual control in the
   oilfield. This existing oil-pumping system, a high power-consuming
   process, has the incapability of OPU's structural health monitoring. In
   this paper, a sensor network based intelligent control is proposed for
   power economy and efficient oilwell health monitoring. The proposed
   sensor network consists of three-level sensors: 1) several types of
   basic sensors, such as load sensor, angular sensor, voltage sensor,
   current sensor and oil pressure sensor, which are the first level
   sensors (FLS), are used for oilwell data sensing; 2) our developed
   intelligent sensors (IS), which belong to the second level sensor, are
   designed mainly for an oilwell's data elementary processing, main fault
   alarm/indication, typical data storage/indication, data/status
   transmission up to the third level sensor (TLS), data/status
   transmission between IS, and command transmission down to the OPU motor;
   and 3) our developed software-defined (SD) control centers with an
   embedded database, i.e., the TLS, are designed for hundreds of oilwells
   data storage/management, data processing, malfunction detection,
   malfunction alarm/indication, stroke-adjustment command transmission
   down to a specific IS for power economy and the malfunction report to
   the maintenance staff via global system for mobile communications (GSM)
   short message service (SMS). Experiment results at the Chinese
   Petroleum's Changqing Oilfield demonstrate our proposed sensor network

Abstract = {{Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are typically obtained for research
   or therapeutic applications by isolating and subculturing adherent cells
   from bone marrow on tissue-culture substrates using growth media. The
   purity and properties of the resulting populations can be affected
   greatly by the conditions under which they are cultured. Fetal bovine
   serum (FBS), although ill-defined, has been widely used as a critical
   requirement for conventional hMSC culture. However, a defined serum-free
   medium would greatly facilitate the development of robust, clinically
   acceptable bioprocesses for reproducibly generating quality-assured
   cells. The present study provides evidence demonstrating that a defined
   serum-free medium (PPRF-msc6) shows several beneficial features over a
   conventional FBS-containing medium for the production of hMSCs. When
   compared to control FBS-based cultures, PPRF-msc6 medium supported the
   derivation of hMSCs from primary cultures of bone marrow cells in a more
   rapid and consistent manner. Furthermore, hMSCs cultured in PPRF-msc6
   exhibited: (a) a greater colony-forming capacity in primary as well as
   passaged cultures; (b) negligible lag phase and explicit exponential
   growth; (c) lower population doubling times (2126 h vs 3538 h between
   passage levels 1 and 10); (d) a greater number of population doublings
   (62 +/- 4 vs 43 +/- 2; over a 2 month period); and (e) a higher degree
   of homogeneity in size. Our data demonstrate that PPRF-msc6 is an
   important development which opens the door for the rapid, efficient and
   reproducible production of hMSCs in clinical settings. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Thermally cracked asphaltenes from Athabasca vacuum residue produced at
   four different process severities were investigated for adsorption and
   subsequent catalytic oxidation. Fe3O4 nanoparticles were used for the
   removal of these four different thermally cracked asphaltenes from
   toluene solutions by a batch-adsorption technique followed by subsequent
   catalytic oxidation. Asphaltene adsorption kinetics and isotherms are
   presented. Further, the catalytic effect of nanoparticles on asphaltene
   oxidation has been addressed. Adsorption was rapid as equilibrium was
   achieved within 10 min. The equilibrium adsorption data fit well to the
   Langmuir model. It was found that the adsorption rate, affinity and
   capacity depend on the molecular weight (MW) of the asphaltenes.
   Adsorption rate and capacity were highest for the lower MW molecules
   while adsorption affinity was strongest for the larger MW molecules. In
   addition, in the absence of nanoparticles, the four thermally cracked
   asphaltenes oxidized differently. However, when adsorbed onto Fe3O4
   nanoparticles their oxidation behavior became similar, showing the
   enhanced catalytic effect of nanoparticles. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The wettability of the Pt/carbon/Nafion catalyst layer in proton
   exchange membrane fuel cells is critical to their performance and
   durability, especially the cathode, as water is needed for the transport
   of protons to the active sites and is also involved in deleterious Pt
   nanoparticle dissolution and carbon corrosion. Therefore, the focus of
   this work has been on the first-time use of the water droplet impacting
   method to determine the wettability of 100\% Nation films, as a
   benchmark, and then of Vulcan carbon (VC)/Nafion composite films, both
   deposited by spin-coating in the Pt-free state. Pure Nafion films, shown
   by SEM analysis to have a nanochanneled structure, are initially
   hydrophobic but become hydrophilic as the water droplet spreads, likely
   due to reorientation of the sulfonic acid groups toward water. The
   wettability of VC/Nafion composite films depends significantly on the
   VC/Nafion mass ratios, even though Nation is believed to be
   preferentially oriented (sulfonate groups toward VC) in all cases. At
   low VC contents, a significant water droplet contact angle hysteresis is
   seen, similar to pure Nafion films, while at higher VC contents (>
   30\%), the films become hydrophobic, also exhibiting
   superhydrophobicity, with surface roughness playing a significant role.
   At > 80\% VC, the surfaces become wettable again as there is
   insufficient Nation loading present to fully cover the carbon surface,
   allowing the calculation of the Nafion:carbon ratio required for a full
   coverage of carbon by Nafion.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative framework for the performance assessment of a traditional
   water treatment plant (WTP) is presented that integrates the concepts of

   (QMRA). Performance assessment for a WTP comprised of three units (i.e.,
   unit 1: Coagulation/Flocculation and Sedimentation; unit 2: Filtration,
   and unit 3: Disinfection) was conducted. Performance functions for units
   1, 2, and units 1 and 2 combined, were constructed by integrating
   turbidity robustness indices. Performance function for chlorine
   disinfection was developed based on the difference between achieved and
   required CT values. A health-based performance function was developed by
   comparing the target daily infection rate to the site-specific infection
   rate. It was used to identify whether the health-based target was met
   during the failures of units 1 to 3. Results obtained from the proposed
   performance functions can be used by operators to ensure that multiple
   barriers perform successfully under variable conditions. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The contours of benign masses and malignant tumors in mammograms and
   other types of breast images differ substantially in their shape and
   complexity; the former are usually round and smooth, whereas the latter
   are typically spiculated and irregular. We demonstrate the usefulness of
   fractal analysis via a frequency domain approach applied to
   one-dimensional signatures of the two-dimensional contours of breast
   masses in mammograms. The 1/f model related to fractional Brownian
   motion was applied via power spectral analysis of signatures to estimate
   the fractal dimension. Experiments with a dataset of 111 contours,
   including those of 65 benign masses and 46 malignant tumors, indicated a
   high classification performance of 0.8962 in terms of the area under the
   receiver-operating characteristic curve. The method should be useful in
   computer-aided diagnosis of breast cancer. (C) 2012 SPIE and IS\&T.

Abstract = {{A novel low-power image sensor with dual analog power supply 1.8 and 1.1
   V during image capture stage is proposed. Different from a traditional
   imager having a unique analog power for image capture, the proposed
   imager works on blocks of 8 x 8 pixels and the power supply for each
   block is selected according to the estimated variance inside the block.
   For the blocks with large variance, high supply voltage will be chosen
   to achieve high imaging performance; otherwise, low supply voltage will
   be used to save power. In addition, the power gating method is applied
   to the additional computation circuits to save power further.
   Theoretical analysis and simulation results by Matlab and Cadence are
   given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methodology. The
   amount of power saved by the proposed imager varies from image to image.
   Theoretically, up to 37\% of power can be saved for images with
   predominant background, while no noticeable quality degradation of the
   reconstructed pictures after compression and decompression is perceived
   (PSNR reduced by less than 1.5 dB). The chip is implemented in TSMC 0.18
   mu m CMOS technology and simulated by Spectre Cadence. The total power
   consumption of the additional computation logic is only about 7.0 mu W.}},

Title = {{New Memory Architecture for Rolling Shutter Wide Dynamic Range CMOS

Abstract = {{In this work, the concept of reusing a memory location to significantly
   reduce the overall memory size for storing wide dynamic range (WDR)
   information in rolling shutter active pixel sensors (APSs) is discussed.
   At the high light level, WDR is achieved via multiple-resets and real
   time feedback, allowing a pixel to independently set its integration
   period as per its ambient light level. Traditionally these WDR bits are
   stored in a dedicated memory location for every pixel. We propose a new
   memory architecture which, in principal, is similar to time division
   multiplexing, such that it achieves memory size reduction by sharing a
   single memory location among a number of pixels as a function of time.
   The proposed architecture is ideally suited for rolling shutter APS,
   where each row is processed sequentially in time. Compared to a commonly
   used memory design, the proposed architecture becomes increasingly
   efficient as the pixel count increases, resulting in momentous savings
   in memory chip area and leakage power consumption. For a pixel array of
   128 128, only 14.2\% of the commonly used memory bits are required, when
   using 7 WDR bits per pixel. This requirement reduces to 8.3\% of the
   commonly used memory bits for a pixel array size of 4096 4096, rendering
   the purposed architecture particularly efficient for larger arrays. The
   savings in leakage power will track the corresponding savings in memory
   size and area especially for newer technologies. The purposed concept
   has been verified in design and simulation for a 128 128 pixel array,
   fabricated in 180 nm technology.}},

Title = {{Leakage Reduction in Advanced Image Sensors Using an Improved AB(2)C
   Scheme}},
Journal = {{IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL}},

Abstract = {{Static leakage currents in advanced CMOS processes have become the main
   source of power consumption in many of today's systems. This is
   especially true for systems with a large number of devices that are in a
   stable state for most of their operation time, such as image sensors and
   memory arrays. This paper introduces an improved adaptive bulk biasing
   control (AB(2)C) scheme for reduction of leakage currents during these
   ``standby{''} periods in serially accessed arrays, while enabling device
   acceleration during active cycles. We provide a theoretical analysis of
   the AB(2)C operation, showing its advantages and limitations. The
   proposed scheme has been integrated with a test-case advanced wide
   dynamic range (WDR) image sensor with an on-chip memory. The scheme was
   applied to both the pixel and bitcell arrays, providing configurable
   leakage reduction and performance enhancement. An 80 nm test chip was
   fabricated with a 10 k pixel/bitcell test-case system and successfully
   tested, showing a 21\% power reduction compared to a standard system and
   up to 44\% compared to an accelerated system.}},

   doi:10.1152/ajpcell.00418.2011.-When arteries constrict to agonists, the
   endothelium inversely responds, attenuating the initial vasomotor
   response. The basis of this feedback mechanism remains uncertain,
   although past studies suggest a key role for myoendothelial
   communication in the signaling process. The present study examined
   whether second messenger flux through myoendothelial gap junctions
   initiates a negative-feedback response in hamster retractor muscle feed
   arteries. We specifically hypothesized that when agonists elicit
   depolarization and a rise in second messenger concentration, inositol
   trisphosphate (IP3) flux activates a discrete pool of IP3 receptors
   (IP(3)Rs), elicits localized endothelial Ca2+ transients, and activates
   downstream effectors to moderate constriction. With use of integrated
   experimental techniques, this study provided three sets of supporting
   observations. Beginning at the functional level, we showed that blocking
   intermediate-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (IK) and Ca2+
   mobilization from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) enhanced the
   contractile/electrical responsiveness of feed arteries to phenylephrine.
   Next, structural analysis confirmed that endothelial projections make
   contact with the overlying smooth muscle. These projections retained
   membranous ER networks, and IP(3)Rs and IK channels localized in or near
   this structure. Finally, Ca2+ imaging revealed that phenylephrine
   induced discrete endothelial Ca2+ events through IP3R activation. These
   events were termed recruitable Ca2+ wavelets on the basis of their
   spatiotemporal characteristics. From these findings, we conclude that
   IP3 flux across myoendothelial gap junctions is sufficient to induce
   focal Ca2+ release from IP(3)Rs and activate a discrete pool of IK
   channels within or near endothelial projections. The resulting
   hyperpolarization feeds back on smooth muscle to moderate
   agonist-induced depolarization and constriction.}},

Abstract = {{The use of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) is common among
   agricultural users and enables the producer to optimize crop production
   within soil variant fields to provide better farming practices. Many
   agricultural navigation systems are dependent on real time GNSS
   navigation solutions to aid and control farm machinery. Direct Current
   (DC) and Alternating Current (AC) transmission lines overhead are often
   suspected to create interference with GNSS equipment preventing farmers
   from utilizing their GNSS supported equipment. This paper provides
   evidence that only non-impeding effects on the receiver or incoming
   signals, in the form of cycle slips, were measured or detected from
   either the overhead lines and/or their corresponding support towers. No
   effect on code measurements was detected. The latter effect is due to
   reflection or brief masking by the towers. Tests were conducted under a
   set of three transmission lines, two 500 kV DC lines and one 230 kV AC
   line. Several GNSS receivers and processing methods, including real time
   and post-processed data, are used to measure and process data to study
   the position accuracy, dilution of precision, number of satellites
   tracked, code and phase errors, location and number of carrier phase
   cycle slips, carrier-to-noise density and L1-L2 carrier divergence. One
   commercial Real Time Kinematic (RTK) survey system was also used to
   verify the 450 MHz data link was operational. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Characterization of petroleum samples in terms of boiling point
   distributions is at the core of the oil business. In addition, knowledge
   of chemical properties like molecular weight (MW) and hydrocarbon
   group-type as well as class-type distributions are also important
   parameters for monitoring upgrading processes. This work studied the
   feasibility of using gas chromatography coupled to flame ionization and
   mass spectrometry detection (GC-FID-MS) for providing all the former
   mentioned parameters in a fast and simple simultaneous approach that
   requires less than 1 h for completion. Comparison with routine thin
   layer chromatography with flame ionization detection (TLC-FID) and
   standardized supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) for hydrocarbon
   group and class-type analyses validated the approach and, furthermore,
   allowed one to highlight advantages or disadvantages for the compared
   techniques. Upgrading processes carried out with atmospheric and vacuum
   distillate feedstocks were monitored with the mentioned characterization
   tools. The application of these techniques was found suitable for
   analyzing petroleum distillates comprised within the C5-C60 carbon
   range. GC-FID-MS was found suitable for samples containing low amounts
   of polar hydrocarbons, in addition was determined capable to
   discriminate HC-class-types for complex samples arising from
   hydroprocessing, catalytic upgrading, and physically separated
   distillation cuts. On the other hand, SFC and TLC-FID yielded restricted
   applicability in the light or heavy distillation ends.}},

Abstract = {{In this brief, a mixed radio frequency/digital signal processing (DSP)
   codesign approach is proposed to enhance the performance of Doherty
   power amplifiers (PAs). For the hardware optimization, a load-pull-based
   design methodology is proposed to determine the optimal matching
   elements of the main amplifier for enhanced efficiency at back-off.
   Subsequently, DSP control of the baseband input signal is used to
   efficiently distribute the drive power between the main and auxiliary
   amplifiers in order to enhance the efficiency at high power levels and
   also to improve the linearity. Precisely, the input power is evenly
   distributed between the two amplifiers at the back-off region and then
   unequally split with more drive into the auxiliary amplifier once the
   latter turns on. This allows for improving the load modulation behavior
   of the Doherty PA and flattening its gain response, which yield enhanced
   efficiency and improved linearity. For the experimental validation, the
   proposed codesign approach is applied to implement a dual-input Doherty
   PA based on a 10-W gallium nitride (GaN) device. Measurement results
   with wideband code division multiple access demonstrated improvements of
   up to 5\% in average drain efficiency and up to 3 dB in adjacent channel
   leakage ratio.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) with
   Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) has been very actively researched for
   many years due to the complementary nature of the two systems. In
   particular, during the last few years the integration with
   micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) inertial measurement units (IMUs)
   has been investigated. In fact, recent advances in MEMS technology have
   made possible the development of a new generation of low cost inertial
   sensors characterized by small size and light weight, which represents
   an attractive option for mass-market applications such as vehicular and
   pedestrian navigation. However, whereas there has been much interest in
   the integration of GPS with a MEMS-based INS, few research studies have
   been conducted on expanding this application to the revitalized GLONASS
   system. This paper looks at the benefits of adding GLONASS to existing
   GPS/INS(MEMS) systems using loose and tight integration strategies. The
   relative benefits of various constraints are also assessed. Results show
   that when satellite visibility is poor (approximately 50\% solution
   availability) the benefits of GLONASS are only seen with tight
   integration algorithms. For more benign environments, a loosely coupled
   GPS/GLONASS/INS system offers performance comparable to that of a
   tightly coupled GPS/INS system, but with reduced complexity and
   development time.}},

Abstract = {{Obesity is a chronic condition involving the excessive accumulation of
   adipose tissue that adversely affects all systems in the body. The aim
   of the present study was to employ an unbiased, genome-wide assessment
   of transcript abundance in order to identify common gene expression
   pathways within insulin-sensitive tissues in response to dietary-induced
   diabetes. Following 20 weeks of chow or high-fat feeding (60\% kcal),
   age-matched mice underwent a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp to assess
   insulin sensitivity. High-fat-fed animals were obese and highly insulin
   resistant, disposing of similar to 75\% less glucose compared with their
   chow-fed counterparts. Tissues were collected, and gene expression was
   examined by microarray in 4 tissues known to exhibit obesity-related
   metabolic disturbances: white adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, liver,
   and heart. A total of 463 genes were differentially expressed between
   diets. Analysis of individual tissues showed skeletal muscle to exhibit
   the largest number of differentially expressed genes (191) in response
   to high-fat feeding, followed by adipose tissue (169), liver (115), and
   heart (65). Analyses revealed that the response of individual genes to
   obesity is distinct and largely tissue specific, with less than 10\% of
   transcripts being shared among tissues. Although transcripts are largely
   tissue specific, a systems approach shows numerous commonly activated
   pathways, including those involved in signal transduction, inflammation,
   oxidative stress, substrate transport, and metabolism. This suggests a
   coordinated attempt by tissues to limit metabolic perturbations
   occurring in early-stage obesity. Many identified genes were associated
   with a variety of disorders, thereby serving as potential links between
   obesity and its related health risks.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the ability of the National Classification System for

   the study showed that sites with low and high NCSCS score ranks
   correspond reasonably with low and high PQRA results ranks though there
   is scatter amongst the data in mid-ranges. Although the output from both
   the NCSCS and PQRAs have significant uncertainties, the study concludes
   that indeed the NCSCS can be used to rank sites. A figure is provided

Abstract = {{Heavy oil and bitumen are expected to become increasingly important
   sources of fuel in the coming decades. There are extensive deposits in
   Alberta that could be a principal source of fuel in the coming century.
   The Athabasca oil sands, the largest petroleum accumulation in the
   world: the Cold Lake oil deposit; and the Lloydminster reservoir are all
   major Canadian oil-sands deposits. Steam-assisted gravity drainage
   (SAGD), which has shown considerable promise in all three of these major
   deposits, remains an expensive technique and requires large energy
   input. The energy intensity of SAGD and the environmental concerns make
   it imperative to find new oil-extraction technologies.
   Coinjecting hydrocarbon additives with steam offers the potential of
   lower energy and water consumption and reduced greenhouse-gas emission
   by improving the oil rates and recoveries. In a previous paper by the
   same authors (Hosseininejad Mohebati et al. 2010), we showed that the
   selection of a suitable hydrocarbon additive and the effectiveness of
   this hybrid process are strongly dependent on the operating conditions,
   reservoir-fluid composition, the heavy-oil viscosity, and the
   petrophysical properties of the reservoir. Among these factors, the
   heavy-oil viscosity, which is the main difference between these three
   reservoirs, could be a very important parameter in the performance of
   this hybrid process. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the
   hydrocarbon additives to SAGD for these three oil-sand deposits
   separately.
   Extensive numerical studies in a 3D model by means of a fully implicit
   thermal simulator were conducted to evaluate the efficiency of each
   hydrocarbon additive with different heavy-oil viscosities (resembling
   those of Athabasca bitumen, Cold Lake heavy oil, and Lloydminster heavy
   oil). Varying mole percents of hexane, butane, and methane were
   coinjected with steam to each reservoir with different heavy-oil
   viscosity. The optimum amount of hydrocarbon injection was reported in
   each case. This culminated in a novel method for selecting the most
   advantageous hydrocarbon additive and its optimum concentration
   considering the heavy-oil viscosity.}},

Abstract = {{In the Pearl River Delta (PRD), river water quality deteriorates
   continually due to the population increase and ongoing industrialization
   and urbanization. In this study, a water quality management paradigm
   based on the seasonal variation is proposed. For better exploring the
   seasonal change of water quality, wavelet analysis was used to analyze
   the division of dry and wet seasons in the PRD during 1952-2009. Then
   water quality seasonal variation in 2008 and relevant impact factors
   were analyzed by multivariate statistic methods as a case to make some
   management measures. The results show that there are some differences of
   dry and wet seasons division among different years. Wet season mainly
   appear from April to September, which occupy the largest proportion
   among the 58 years (about 70\%) and then followed by the wet season from
   May to October (about 13.8\% of the total years). As to the water
   quality of 2008, significant differences exist between dry and wet
   seasons for 17 water quality parameters except TP, NO3-, Fe2+, and Zn2+.
   Levels of parameters pH, EC, CODMn, BOD5, NH4+, SO42-, and Cl- in dry
   season are much higher than those in wet season. In dry season the
   variations of river water quality are mainly influenced by domestic
   sewage, industrial effluents, and salt water intrusion. While in wet
   season, except the aforementioned pollution sources, drainages from
   cultivated land and livestock farm are also the main factors influencing
   water pollution. Thus, water quality management measures are proposed in
   dry and wet seasons, respectively. The results obtained from this study
   would further facilitate water quality protection and water resources
   management in the PRD.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most important issues for researchers developing image
   processing algorithms is image quality. Methodical quality evaluation,
   by showing images to several human observers, is slow, expensive, and
   highly subjective. On the other hand, a visual quality matrix (VQM) is a
   fast, cheap, and objective tool for evaluating image quality. Although
   most VQMs are good in predicting the quality of an image degraded by a
   single degradation, they poorly perform for a combination of two
   degradations. An example for such degradation is the color crosstalk
   (CTK) effect, which introduces blur with desaturation. CTK is expected
   to become a bigger issue in image quality as the industry moves toward
   smaller sensors. In this paper, we will develop a VQM that will be able
   to better evaluate the quality of an image degraded by a combined
   blur/desaturation degradation and perform as well as other VQMs on
   single degradations such as blur, compression, and noise. We show why
   standard scalar techniques are insufficient to measure a combined
   blur/desaturation degradation and explain why a vectorial approach is
   better suited. We introduce quaternion image processing (QIP), which is
   a true vectorial approach and has many uses in the fields of physics and
   engineering. Our new VQM is a vectorial expansion of structure
   similarity using QIP, which gave it its name-Quaternion Structural
   SIMilarity (QSSIM). We built a new database of a combined
   blur/desaturation degradation and conducted a quality survey with human
   subjects. An extensive comparison between QSSIM and other VQMs on
   several image quality databases-including our new database-shows the
   superiority of this new approach in predicting visual quality of color
   images.}},

Abstract = {{The resistance to forming microcracks is a key factor for bone to
   withstand critical loads without fracturing. In this study, we
   investigated the initiation and propagation of microcracks in murine
   cortical bone by combining three-dimensional images from synchrotron
   radiation-based computed tomography and time-lapsed biomechanical
   testing to observe microdamage accumulation over time. Furthermore, a
   novel deformable image registration procedure utilizing digital volume
   correlation and demons image registration was introduced to compute 3D
   strain maps allowing characterization of the mechanical environment of
   the microcracks. The displacement and strain maps were validated in a
   priori tests. At an image resolution of 740 nm the spatial resolution of
   the strain maps was 10 mu m (MTF), while the errors of the displacements
   and strains were 130 nm and 0.013, respectively. The strain maps
   revealed a complex interaction of the propagating microcracks with the

   play a dual role as stress concentrating features reducing bone
   strength, while at the same time contributing to the bone toughness by
   blunting the crack tip. We conclude that time-lapsed biomechanical
   imaging in combination with three-dimensional strain mapping is suitable
   for the investigation of crack initiation and propagation in many porous

Abstract = {{The proposed in situ catalytic upgrading of heavy oil to achieve an
   environmentally sustainable method for heavy oil recovery requires the
   placement of nanodispersed catalyst particles deep into the formation
   where it can accelerate the high-temperature upgrading reactions. In
   continuation of the previous work {[}Zamani et al., Energy Fuels 24,
   4980-4988 (2010)], this paper presents results of several new
   experiments carried out to examine the effects of other parameters,
   including the connate brine salinity, absolute permeability, sand-bed
   temperature and particle concentration on the propagation of
   nanoparticles in porous media. The results show that lower permeability,
   increased operating temperature and higher particle concentration did
   not significantly affect the propagation of nanodispersed catalyst
   suspension through the sand-bed. Virtually the same filtration
   behaviour, displaying a rapid increase of effluent concentration at 1
   pore volume injected to a steady concentration close to the inlet
   concentration was seen in all experiments. A classical phenomenological
   approach was used to model the macroscopic propagation behaviour of
   suspended particles in the porous medium. The model was successful in
   history matching the effluent composition profile observed in the
   experiments and the deposition profile obtained from post-test analysis
   of the sand-bed. (c) 2011 Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering}},

Abstract = {{Pyrolysis kinetics of thermal decomposition of bitumen was investigated
   by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). TGA experiments were conducted at
   multiple heating rates of 5, 10, 20 degrees C?min1 up to 800 degrees C
   to obtain the pyrolysis characteristics of bitumen. Weight loss curve
   from TGA shows that two different stages occurred during bitumen
   pyrolysis. Differential method has been used for determining the kinetic
   parameters and the best fit for the order of reaction was found based on
   the R2 values. Kinetics results confirm the presence of two different
   stages in bitumen pyrolysis with varying kinetic parameters. The average
   activation energy for the first and second stage was 29 and 60?kJ?mol-1
   and the average order of the reaction was 1.5 and 0.25, respectively.
   Experiments have been conducted with different reservoir sand. The
   effect of different source of sand reveals no effect on the pyrolysis
   behaviour of bitumen. A considerable difference was found with the

Abstract = {{There is an emerging requirement for processing global navigation
   satellite system (GNSS) signals indoor where the signal is very weak and
   subjected to spatial fading. Typically, longer coherent integration
   intervals provide the additional processing gain required for the
   detection and processing of such weak signals. However, the arbitrary
   physical motion of the handset imputed by the user limits the
   effectiveness of longer coherent integration intervals due to the
   spatial decorrelation of the multipath-faded GNSS signal. In this paper,
   limits of coherent integration due to spatial decorrelation are derived
   and corroborated with experimental verification. A general result is
   that the processing gain resulting from direct coherent integration
   saturates after the antenna has moved through a certain distance, which
   for typical indoor propagation, is about half a carrier wavelength.
   However, a refined Doppler search coupled with a prolonged coherent
   integration interval extends this limit, which is effectively a
   manifestation of selective diversity.}},

Pages = {{197-207}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The carrier phase tracking loop is the primary focus of the current
   work. In particular, two carrier phase tracking techniques are compared,
   the standard phase tracking loop, i.e., the phase lock loop (PLL), and
   the extended Kalman filter (EKF) tracking loop. In order to compare
   these two different techniques and taking into consideration the
   different models adopted in each, it is important to bring them to one
   common ground. In order to accomplish this, the equivalent PLL for a
   given EKF has to be determined in terms of steady-state response to both
   thermal noise and signal dynamics. A novel method for experimentally
   calculating the equivalent bandwidth of the EKF is presented and used to
   evaluate the performance of the equivalent PLL. Results are shown for
   both the L1 and L5 signals. Even though the two loops are designed to
   track equivalent dynamics and to have equivalent carrier phase standard
   deviations, the EKF outperforms the equivalent PLL in terms of both the
   transient response and sensitivity.}},

Abstract = {{A novel modeling method is presented for indexing and normalizing
   natural gas endowments of petroleum provinces. The approach is
   demonstrated with data from Canada, the Unites States, and Latin
   American and Caribbean (LAC) countries. A variable shape distribution
   model (VSD) is used to fit the conventional natural gas endowment
   published by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) for 29 provinces
   in LAC countries and 85 provinces in Canada and the United States. These
   data are indexed and normalized to generate curves showing number of
   provinces versus normalized endowments. Results are compared with
   normalized endowments from provinces in other regions around the world,
   including Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, North Africa, and the
   former Soviet Union (FSU). The comparison gives the method predictive
   power for estimating the natural gas endowment, particularly in LAC
   provinces that at present have little exploration activity. Of
   particular importance is the fact that all the curves of the various
   regions display a generally concave pattern throughout. The exception is
   the LAC curve, which displays the shape of an inverted S and has a
   distinct convex pattern at the largest gas endowment volumes. This
   comparison suggests there is potentially a large volume of natural gas
   in the region that has not been considered in previous studies.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce an algorithm and a computer code for
   numerical differentiation of discrete functions. The algorithm presented
   is suitable for calculating derivatives of any degree with any arbitrary
   order of accuracy over all the known function sampling points. The
   algorithm introduced avoids the labour of preliminary differencing and
   is in fact more convenient than using the tabulated finite difference
   formulas, in particular when the derivatives are required with high
   approximation accuracy. Moreover, the given Matlab computer code can be
   implemented to solve boundary-value ordinary and partial differential
   equations with high numerical accuracy. The numerical technique is based
   on the undetermined coefficient method in conjunction with Taylor's
   expansion. To avoid the difficulty of solving a system of linear
   equations, an explicit closed form equation for the weighting
   coefficients is derived in terms of the elementary symmetric functions.
   This is done by using an explicit closed formula for the Vandermonde
   matrix inverse. Moreover, the code is designed to give a unified
   approximation order throughout the given domain. A numerical
   differentiation example is used to investigate the validity and
   feasibility of the algorithm and the code. It is found that the method
   and the code work properly for any degree of derivative and any order of
   accuracy. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Unmanned ground vehicles currently exhibit simple autonomous behaviours.
   This paper presents a control algorithm developed for a tracked vehicle
   to autonomously climb obstacles by varying its front and back track
   orientations. A reactive controller computes a desired geometric
   configuration based on terrain information. A reinforcement learning
   algorithm enhances vehicle mobility by finding effective exit strategies
   in deadlock situations. It is capable of incorporating complex
   information including terrain and vehicle dynamics through learned
   experiences. Experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   approach for climbing various obstacles. Crown Copyright (C) 2011

Title = {{Hydrothermal liquefaction of cellulose to bio-oil under acidic, neutral
   and alkaline conditions}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{92}},
Pages = {{234-239}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of biomass to bio-oil under alkaline or
   neutral conditions has been widely reported in literature. However,
   there has been limited data available in literature on comparing HTL of
   biomass to bio-oil under acidic, neutral, and alkaline in terms of
   chemical compositions and yields by using the same reaction conditions
   and reactor. Using cellulose as a feedstock we conducted the comparative
   studies for pH = 3,7 and 14 at temperatures of 275-320 degrees C with
   reaction residence times of 0-30 min. Results showed that the chemical
   compositions of the bio-oils were different for acidic, neutral and
   alkaline conditions. Under acidic and neutral conditions. the main
   composition of HTL bio-oil was 5-(Hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF). Under
   alkaline conditions, the main compounds became C2-5 carboxylic acids.
   For bio-oil yields, it was observed that high temperatures and long
   residence times had negative effects, regardless of the pH levels.
   However, the corresponding reaction mechanisms are different. Under
   acidic conditions, the decrease in the bio-oil yields was mainly caused
   by polymerization of 5-HMF to solids. Under neutral conditions, the
   bio-oil yields decreased because 5-HMF was converted to both solid and
   gaseous products. Under alkaline conditions, the bio-oil decomposed to
   gases through the formation of short chain acids and aldehydes.
   Therefore, although they were all referred to as HTL bio-oil in
   literature, they were formed by different reaction pathways and had
   different properties due to their different chemical compositions. Given
   these differences, different strategies are recommended in this study to
   further improve HTL of biomass to bio-oil. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This article deals with the safety assessment of several ultra-wideband
   (UWB) antenna designs for use in prototype microwave breast imaging
   systems. First, the performances of the antennas are validated by
   comparison of measured and simulated data collected for a simple test
   case. An efficient approach to estimating the specific energy absorption
   (SA) is introduced and validated. Next, SA produced by the UWB antennas
   inside more realistic breast models is computed. In particular, the
   power levels and pulse repetition periods adopted for the SA evaluation
   follow the measurement protocol employed by a tissue sensing adaptive
   radar (TSAR) prototype system. Results indicate that the SA for the
   antennas examined is below limits prescribed in standards for exposure
   of the general population; however, the difficulties inherent in
   applying such standards to UWB exposures are discussed. The results also
   suggest that effective tools for the rapid evaluation of new sensors

Abstract = {{Multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)/polystyrene (PS) composites were
   injection molded into a mold equipped with three different cavities. A
   high alignment of MWCNTs in PS was achieved by applying high shear force
   to the melt. The effects of gate and runner designs and processing
   conditions, i.e., mold temperature, melt temperature, injection/holding
   pressure and injection velocity, on the volume resistivity of the
   composites were investigated in both the thickness and in-flow
   directions. The experiments showed that volume resistivity could be
   varied up to 7 orders of magnitude by changing the processing conditions
   in the injection molded samples. The electromagnetic interference
   shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) of the molded composites was studied by
   considering the alignment of the MWCNTs. The EMI SE decreased with an
   increase in the alignment of the injection-molded MWCNTs in the PS
   matrix. This study shows that mold designs and processing conditions

Abstract = {{Incorrect resection of the patella during total knee arthroplasty (TKA)

   patellofemoral impingement, patellar fracture, component loosening, and
   reduced range of motion. Computer-assisted surgery (CAS) systems for the

   optoelectronic localizer, marker arrays on the patella and instruments,
   and navigation software. Three users performed resections on artificial
   patellae mounted in a simulated surgical setup using five techniques
   (two CAS, three conventional), each repeated at least three times in

   superoinferiorly. Using CAS with a sawguide produced better results than
   using CAS freehand with an oscillating saw. This study showed the
   feasibility of computer-assisted patellar resection, which could lead to
   reduced pain and complications after TKA. The feedback provided could
   also make patellar CAS a valuable training tool. (C) 2011 Orthopaedic

Abstract = {{Calcium oxide is a known adsorbent for the capture of carbon dioxide. In
   this study, CaO-based sorbents were prepared using the precipitation of
   solutions containing different anion precursors, including nitrate NO3-
   and chloride Cl-, by different alkaline precipitants. The sorbents
   prepared from the precipitation of salt solutions by alkaline solutions
   under specific precipitation conditions resulted in the excellent uptake
   capacity for CO2. These sorbents formed as a fine powder with a BET
   surface area (16.5 m(2)/g) and pore volume (0.35 cm(3)/g) showed almost
   100\% carbonation, at temperatures between 650 and 750 degrees C.
   Moreover, the carbonation proceeded predominantly during an initial
   short period. Under numerous carbonation/calcination cycles, these
   sorbents demonstrated a good reversibility. During a 17-cycle operation,
   the sorbents maintained a fairly high conversion of 70\% at 700 degrees
   C. As the carbonation/calcination cycles progress, sorbent particles
   conglomerate to a loosely integrated lump resulting in a greater mass
   transfer resistance for CO2 molecules to reach the unreacted core of
   calcium oxide. It is observed that grinding of the formed chunk to fine
   particles could recover the activity of sorbent completely.}},

Abstract = {{The stability of a horizontal interface between a solution of reactant A
   on top of another solution of reactant B is analysed. A chemical product
   C is generated at the interface as a result of a bimolecular chemical
   reaction A + B -> C. In general, all chemical components are assumed to
   have different densities and viscosities, and a transverse velocity is
   introduced parallel to the interface between the reactants. Although the
   transverse flow is known for its stabilizing effect in viscously
   unstable non-reactive systems in the presence of an injection velocity,
   it is shown here that it can actually destabilize an initially stable
   reactive front. An expression for the critical transverse velocity
   beyond which an initially stable interface is destabilized is derived in
   the case of an initial sharp interface for reactants of the same
   viscosity. The analysis is extended to a diffused profile, and purely
   buoyancy-driven flows are analysed first in the absence of viscosity
   contrast and then in the presence of transverse flows and viscosity
   contrast. Various possible density fingering scenarios are determined
   based on the relative contribution of each chemical component to the
   density profile. It is found that the chemical reaction can destabilize
   a buoyancy-stable initial interface by generating a non-monotonic
   density profile. Unlike the viscous fingering of a reactive interface, a
   symmetry in the stability characteristics with respect to density
   increase or decrease by chemical reaction product is observed in the
   case of chemically buoyancy-driven flows for identical reactants.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the effects of change in the concentrations of
   monovalent and divalent ions in the polymer-contained surfactant
   solution on the macroscopic behavior of viscous-modified surfactant
   waterflooding in heavy oil reservoirs. Salts that are used in this set
   of floods were sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, and calcium
   chloride. The results indicate that four different ranges of salinity
   (in terms of CaCl2 concentration) exist. Each of these ranges renders a
   unique behavior regarding the ultimate oil recovery trends. There exists
   a range of salinity in which the ultimate oil recovery does not change
   with the salinity increase. The second salinity range is beyond the salt
   tolerance (i.e., first salinity range) of the polymer-contained
   surfactant solution, which results in a decrease in the ultimate oil
   recovery. In the third range of salinity, ultimate oil recovery is
   enhanced due to the plugging of high-permeable pores. In the fourth
   salinity range, precipitation increases as the salinity increases and
   more pore throats (even some pores with intermediate permeability) are
   plugged and, thus, the ultimate oil recovery decreases.}},

Abstract = {{Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) have many potential applications in
   tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Currently, hMSCs are
   generated through conventional static adherent cultures in the presence
   of fetal bovine serum (FBS) for clinical applications (e.g., multiple
   sclerosis). However, these methods are not appropriate to meet the
   expected future demand for quality-assured hMSCs for human therapeutic
   use. Hence, it is imperative to develop an effective hMSC production
   system, which should be controllable, reproducible, and scalable. To
   this end, efforts have been made by several international research
   groups to develop (i) alternative media either by replacing FBS with
   human-sourced supplements (such as human serum or platelet lysate) or by
   identifying defined serum-free formulations consisting of key
   growth/attachment factors, and (ii) controlled bioreactor protocols. In
   this regard, we review here current hMSC production technologies and
   future perspectives toward efficient methods for the generation of
   clinically relevant numbers of hMSC therapeutics.}},

Abstract = {{This work aims at obtaining a covariant representation of the elasticity
   tensor of a hyperelastic material when the elastic strain energy
   potential is written employing the volumetric-distortional decomposition
   of the deformation. This requires the careful definition of some
   fundamental fourth-order tensors: the identity, the spherical operator,
   and the deviatoric operator, which appear in the material and spatial
   expressions of the elasticity tensor. These operators can be defined in
   the spatial or the material setting and admit pulled-back and
   pushed-forward forms, respectively. These forms are intimately related
   to the pulled-back and pushed-forward metric tensors, and are somewhat
   awkward to derive in Cartesian coordinates, because of the loss of the
   distinction between a vector space and its dual, and therefore between
   objects having contravariant and covariant components, which obey to
   different transformation laws. The relationship between the deformation
   and the various forms of the identity, spherical, and deviatoric
   operators can be entirely clarified only within a covariant theory,
   where the central role played by the spatial and material metric
   tensors, and their pulled-back and pushed-forward counterparts, which
   are deformation tensors, can be emphasised. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We represent a biological tissue by a multi-constituent,
   fiber-reinforced material, in which we consider two phases: fluid, and a
   fiber-reinforced solid. Among the various processes that may occur in
   such a system, we study growth, mass transfer, and remodeling. To us,
   mass transfer is the reciprocal exchange of constituents between the
   phases, growth is the variation of mass of the system in response to
   interactions with the surrounding environment, and remodeling is the
   evolution of its internal structure. We embrace the theory according to
   which these events, which lead to a structural reorganization of the
   system and anelastic deformations, require the introduction of balance
   laws, which complete the physical picture offered by the standard ones.
   The former are said to be nonstandard. Our purposes are to determine the
   rates of anelastic deformation related to mass transfer and growth, and
   to study fiber reorientation in the case of a statistical distribution
   of fibers. In particular, we discuss the use of the non-standard balance
   laws in modeling transfer of mass, and compare our results with a
   formulation in which such balance laws are not introduced. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Purpose: Voxel-based relaxometry (VBR) is a technique in which a
   voxel-level statistical comparison of quantitative MR 12 maps is
   performed to identify regions with significantly elevated 12 relaxation
   time. Our objective was to assess the performance of single-subject VBR
   at 31 as a diagnostic tool for patients whose diagnosis of epilepsy or
   seizure focus location is uncertain.
   Methods: Fifty-nine patients with possible epilepsy or known epilepsy,
   but an unknown focus and forty-five healthy controls were studied. All
   subjects were scanned at 31 using a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom Gill MR
   sequence. Single-subject VBR was performed at a significance level of
   alpha = 0.001. Patients were classified based on whether the diagnosis
   of epilepsy was in question and whether there was a suspected focus. A
   VBR score was determined based on the presence of VBR abnormalities in
   any of 13 predefined regions per hemisphere.
   Results: All patients exhibited significantly more median VBR
   abnormalities than controls (p<0.05). VBR abnormalities were seen in
   69\% and 89\% of patients with a normal or questionably abnormal MR
   scan, respectively. Nineteen of the 27 patients with a suspected focus
   (70\%) had VBR abnormalities in the suspected focus, with additional
   regions of involvement being elucidated. VBR also correctly predicted
   the seizure focus in 50\% of patients whose seizure foci were confirmed
   based on follow-up history or clinical investigations.
   Conclusions: Single subject VBR can help identify potential seizure foci
   in patients whose seizure foci are uncertain. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Fluoroscopic imaging is commonly used for assessing relative motions of
   orthopaedic implants. One limiting factor to in vivo model-based
   roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis of total knee arthroplasty is
   the need for 3D models of the implants.The 3D models of the implant
   components must be reverse-engineered, if not provided by the company,
   which makes this method impractical for a clinical study involving many
   types or sizes of implants. This study introduces a novel feature-based
   methodology that registers the features at the implant-bone or
   implant-cement interface of the components that have elementary shapes.
   These features include pegs with hemispherical heads, and straight,
   circular or curved edges located on flat faces of the box of the femoral
   component or the stem geometry of the tibial component. Software was
   developed to allow easy registration of these features through a
   graphical user interface. The accuracy and precision of registration for
   multiple flexion angles from 0 to 120 deg was determined with reference
   to registered poses of the implants through experiments on bone replica
   models and also on a cadaver specimen implanted with total knee
   prostheses. When compared to an equivalent bi-planar model-based
   registration, the results were comparable: The mean accuracy of this
   feature-based method was 1.45 deg and 1.03 mm (in comparison to 0.95 deg
   and 1.32 mm for the model-based approach), and the mean precision was
   0.57 deg and 0.26 mm (in comparison to 0.42 deg and 0.44 mm for the
   model-based approach).The methodology and the developed software can
   easily accommodate different design of implants with various fixation
   features. This method can facilitate in vivo kinematic analysis of total
   knee arthroplasty by eliminating the need for 3D models of the implant
   components. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4006198]}},

Abstract = {{The alkaline earth carbonates are an important class of minerals. This

   earth carbonates in water and in simple aqueous electrolyte solutions.
   Part 1, the present paper, outlines the procedure adopted in this volume

   minerals magnesite (MgCO3), nesquehonite (MgCO3 center dot 3H(2)O), and
   lansfordite (MgCO3 center dot 5H(2)O), a critical evaluation is
   presented based on curve fits to empirical and/or thermodynamic models.
   Useful side products of the compilation and evaluation of the data
   outlined in the introduction are new relationships for the Henry
   constant of CO2 with Sechenov parameters, and for various equilibria in
   the aqueous phase including the dissociation constants of CO2(aq) and
   the stability constant of the ion pair MCO30(aq) (M = alkaline earth
   metal). Thermodynamic data of the alkaline earth carbonates consistent
   with two thermodynamic model variants are proposed. The model variant
   that describes the Mg2+-HCO3- ion interaction with Pitzer parameters was
   more consistent with the solubility data and with other thermodynamic
   data than the model variant that described the interaction with a

Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{3512-3527}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{There has been a lot of interest in recent years in using inertial
   sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes) to monitor movement disorder
   motion and monitor the efficacy of treatment options. Two of the most
   prominent movement disorders, which are under evaluation in this
   research paper, are essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease (PD).
   These movement disorders are first evaluated to show that ET and PD
   motion often depict more (tremor) motion content in the 3-12 Hz
   frequency band of interest than control data and that such tremor motion
   can be characterized using inertial sensors. As well, coherence analysis
   is used to compare between pairs of many of the six degrees-of-freedom
   of motions under evaluation, to determine the similarity in tremor
   motion for the various degrees-of-freedom at different frequency bands
   of interest. It was quite surprising that this coherence analysis
   depicts that there is a statistically significant relationship using
   coherence analysis when differentiating between control and effectively
   medicated PD motion. The statistical analysis uncovers the novel finding
   that PD medication induced dyskinesia is depicted within coherence data
   from inertial signals. Dyskinesia is involuntary motion or the absence
   of intended motion, and it is a common side effect among medicated PD
   patients. The results show that inertial sensors can be used to
   differentiate between effectively medicated PD motion and control
   motion; such a differentiation can often be difficult to perform with
   the human eye because effectively medicated PD patients tend to not
   produce much tremor. As well, the finding that PD motion, when well
   medicated, does still differ significantly from control motion allows
   for researchers to quantify potential deficiencies in the use of
   medication. By using inertial sensors to spot such deficiencies, as
   outlined in this research paper, it is hoped that medications with even
   a larger degree of efficacy can be created in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Navigation and location technologies are continually advancing, allowing

Abstract = {{We use a global energy market (GEM) model to show that natural gas has

   The GEM provides a close fit of the global energy mix between 1850 and
   2005. It also matches historical carbon and CO2 emissions generated by
   the combustion of fossil fuels. The model is used then to forecast the
   future energy mix, as well as the carbon and CO2 emissions, up to the
   year 2150.
   Historical data show relative decarbonization and an increase in the
   amount of hydrogen burned as a percent of fossil fuel use between 1850
   and 1970. The GEM indicates that with a larger contribution of natural
   gas to the future energy market, the burned hydrogen percentage will
   increase. This decarbonization will help to advance economic and
   environmental sustainability. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   volume expansion in Canada, HES 130/0.4 (Voluven(R)) and HES 260/0.45
   (Pentaspan(R)). Although information is available regarding their
   pharmacokinetic and risk/benefit profiles, this paper examines their
   viscous properties.
   Methods Dynamic viscosities of HES 130/0.4 and HES 260/0.45 were
   measured through capillary viscometry at 21 degrees C and 37 degrees C.
   The viscosities of the solutions were then measured through a closed
   flow loop at room temperature across physiologically relevant flow rates
   that maintained a laminar flow regime.
   Results Measured dynamic viscosity through capillary viscometry for HES
   130/0.4 and HES 260/0.45 was 2.76 centipoises (cP) and 7.62 cP,
   respectively, at 21 degrees C decreasing to 1.74 cP and 4.25 cP,
   respectively, at 37 degrees C. Pipe flow analysis found that HES 130/0.4
   (expiry 02/13) and HES 260/0.45 (expiry 10/10) displayed marginal
   variation in viscosity suggesting Newtonian behaviour. However, a sample
   of HES 130/0.4 (expiry 10/10) displayed an appreciable increase in
   viscosity (13\%) at higher flow rates suggesting shear thickening
   behaviour.
   Conclusion This study represents an innovative characterization of not
   only the viscosity of two commonly utilized HES solutions but also their
   viscous behaviour across physiologically relevant flow rates. The shear
   thickening behaviour of a sample of HES 130/0.40 (expiry 10/10) at high
   flow rates was not expected, and the effect this result may have on
   endothelial cell function is unknown.}},

Abstract = {{The direct utilization of methanol and ethanol was tested in
   La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-delta (LSCM) anodes to verify stability and to
   determine whether this material can inhibit carbon formation. The
   catalytic decomposition of the alcohols was tested ex situ, while
   performance and stability were tested in situ at 800 degrees C. Ex situ
   results indicate that in methanol LSCM rapidly loses its catalytic
   activity for the decomposition reaction, while in ethanol pyrolytic
   reactions are dominant. LSCM does not inhibit carbon formation with both
   alcohol fuels. In situ cell performance is modest both in hydrogen and
   alcohols fuels. Performance degradation is observed after exposure to
   the alcohols, but coking does not permanently damage the electrode
   structure. Increased conductivities as well as optimization of the
   electrode microstructures are required to improve the performance of
   these anodes.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports on an experimental investigation that evaluates the
   effectiveness of newly developed material, steel fibre reinforced
   polymer (SFRP) sheets to confine small-scale plain concrete circular and
   square columns. Different parameters were investigated including: number
   of SFRP layers (1, 2, and 3), target concrete compressive strength (25,
   30, and 35 MPa), cross-section of the columns (circular and square), and
   corner radius for square columns (3, 6, 10, and 25 mm). The experimental
   investigation was conducted in three phases. In Phase I, 36 circular
   specimens (150 mm diameter x 300 mm height) and in Phase II, 36 square
   specimens (150 mm side length x 300 mm height) were tested. In each
   phase, the specimens were divided into three groups according to
   concrete compressive strength. In each group, three specimens were
   tested without wrapping for comparison purposes, and three specimens for
   each number of layers. In Phase III, 12 SFRP wrapped (one layer) square
   specimens with a target concrete compressive strength of 25 MPa were
   tested to investigate the effect of varying the corner radii on the
   confined compressive strength. The specimens were tested under monotonic
   concentric uni-axial compression load. Results showed that SFRP
   confinement improved the performance of both circular and square
   specimens in terms of axial strength and ductility; however, the
   improvement for square specimens was not as prominent as that for
   circular specimens. Rounding the corners of the square specimens
   improves the situation for square specimens and performance enhances
   with increasing corner radius. The confined concrete compressive
   strength was predicted using equations available in different codes and
   models and compared with experimental results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Micro mechanical machining operations can fabricate miniaturized
   components from a wide range of engineering materials; however, there
   are several challenges during the operations that can cause dimensional
   inaccuracies and low productivity. In order to select optimal machining
   parameters, the material removal behavior during micro machining
   operations needs to be understood and implemented in models. The
   presence of the tool edge radius in micro machining, which is comparable
   in size to the uncut chip thickness, introduces a minimum uncut chip
   thickness (MUCT) under which the material is not removed but ploughed,
   resulting in increased machining forces that affect the surface
   integrity of the workpiece. This paper investigates the MUCT of
   rounded-edge tools. Analytical models based on identifying the stagnant
   point of the workpiece material during the machining have been proposed.
   Based on the models, the MUCT is found to be functions of the edge
   radius and friction coefficient, which is dependent on the tool geometry
   and properties of the workpiece material. The necessary parameters for
   the model are obtained experimentally from orthogonal cutting tests
   using a rounded-edge tool. The minimum uncut chip thickness (MUCT) is
   then verified with experimental tests using an aluminum workpiece. (C)

Title = {{Production Analysis of Tight-Gas and Shale-Gas Reservoirs Using the
   Dynamic-Slippage Concept}},
Journal = {{SPE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{230-242}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Shales and some tight-gas reservoirs have complex, multimodal pore-size
   distributions, including pore sizes in the nanopore range, causing gas
   to be transported by multiple flow mechanisms through the pore
   structure. Ertekin et al. (1986) developed a method to account for
   dual-mechanism (pressure- and concentration-driven) flow for tight
   formations that incorporated an apparent Klinkenberg gas-slippage factor
   that is not a constant, which is commonly assumed for tight gas
   reservoirs. In this work, we extend the dynamic-slippage concept to
   shale-gas reservoirs, for which it is postulated that multimechanism
   flow can occur. Inspired by recent studies that have demonstrated the
   complex pore structure of shale-gas reservoirs, which may include
   nanoporosity in kerogen, we first develop a numerical model that
   accounts for multimechanism flow in the inorganic- and organic-matter
   framework using the dynamic-slippage concept. In this formulation,
   unsteady-state desorption of gas from the kerogen is accounted for. We
   then generate a series of production forecasts using the numerical model
   to demonstrate the consequences of not rigorously accounting for
   multimechanism flow in tight formations. Finally, we modify modern
   rate-transient-analysis methods by altering pseudovariables to include
   dynamic-slippage and desorption effects and demonstrate the utility of
   this approach with simulated and field cases. The primary contribution
   of this work is therefore the demonstration of the use of modern
   rate-transient-analysis methods for reservoirs exhibiting multimechanism
   (non-Darcy) flow. The approach is considered to be useful for analysis
   of production data from shale-gas and tight-gas formations because it
   captures the physics of flow in such formations realistically.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, low-temperature oxidation (LTO) of a heavy oil sample from
   Alaska has been investigated. Six isothermal and one non-isothermal
   experimental runs were conducted between 100 and 350 degrees C, where
   LTO dominates. The combustion data obtained from a thermogravimetric
   analyzer (TGA) was analyzed, and a comparison has been made between the
   kinetic parameters (reaction order, rate constant, and activation
   energy) from a first-order, general reaction rate and Segal and Fatu's
   approach. The temperature scan of the oxidation process revealed that
   there were four temperature intervals during which different modes
   dominated the LTO process. The first temperature interval, ranging from
   100 to 150 degrees C, and the third interval, ranging from 200 to 250
   degrees C, both had overall reactions that were endothermic. However, in
   the second zone from 150 and 200 degrees C and the fourth subzone from
   250 to 350 degrees C, exothermic reactions were dominant. The peak LTO
   rate occurred during the fourth interval, from 250 to 350 degrees C, and
   exhibits a decreasing rate versus temperature: the greater the
   temperature, the lower the reaction rate. The results obtained from the
   isothermal runs reveal that the reaction rate constant, activation
   energy, and pre-exponential factor for each temperature (determined from
   the first-order rate model) are all higher than those measures obtained
   in the general reaction rate model. The results from the non-isothermal
   runs showed that the values of the reaction rate constant, activation
   energy, and pre-exponential factor obtained from the approach by Segal
   and Fatu are similar to those calculated from the general reaction rate
   model. This was particularly true for the LTO peak temperature. The
   analysis of the results yields the mean activation energy for the LTO
   peak equal to 1130.2 cal/mol for isothermal experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Water-in-vacuum gas oil microemulsion containing ultradispersed
   multimetallic colloidal nanoparticles can facilitate in situ delivery of
   nanoparticles into a heavy oil reservoir. This study investigated the
   transport of multimetallic nanoparticles (W, Ni, and Mo) of potential
   catalytic value suspended in vacuum gas oil using different
   oil-sands-packed bed column breakthrough experiments at a typical
   pressure and temperature of the steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD)
   recovery process. The nanoparticles (34 +/- 0.5 nm) were transported
   into two different permeability oil sands. Experiments were performed at
   a pressure of 3.5 MPa, residence time of 36 h, and temperatures from 300
   to 320 degrees C in both low- and high-permeability-oil-sands-packed
   beds. At full breakthrough, a constant normalized concentration plateau
   was achieved, ranging from 0.50 for low-permeability oil sands to 0.60
   for high-permeability oil sands. Deposition and transport of
   nanoparticles were strongly dependent upon their metallic type,
   temperature, and porosity of oil sands. Despite aggregation of
   nanoparticles at a high temperature, neither major permeability
   reduction nor pore plugging were observed. Therefore, propagation of
   multimetallic ultradispersed nanoparticles in oil sands media seems
   feasible under a typical pressure and temperature of the SAGD process.}},

Abstract = {{In cognitive radio networks (CRNs), cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS)
   is usually performed periodically due to the uncertain activity of
   primary users (PUs). Considering the overhead in performing CSS, a
   selfish secondary user (SU) may not always participate in CSS. Instead,
   it elaborately selects a frequency (or number of times) for CSS
   participation to maximize its interest. A fusion center then schedules
   it to conduct CSS in appropriate periods. This paper investigates the
   interactive decision on the CSS participation frequency under sensing
   performance and quality of service (QoS) requirements. The problem is
   formulated as a noncooperative game, where Nash Equilibrium (NE)
   corresponds to the desired frequency selection outcome. Since the
   strategy sets of SUs are coupled, obtaining directly the NE requires
   explicit coordination among SUs, which is unrealistic in practice.
   Alternatively, we decompose the game into a lower-level uncoupled game
   and a higher-level optimization problem. A distributed hierarchical
   iterative algorithm (DHIA) is then proposed to obtain the desired
   frequency selection outcome without requiring explicit coordination.
   Furthermore, the uncertain sensing performance of SUs and the fairness
   issue are also considered. Finally, numerical results validate the
   effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides the experimental results of a new hybrid beam
   intended for use in bridge applications. The hybrid beams were made up
   of pultruded Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) hollow box section
   beams strengthened with a layer of Ultra-High-Performance-Concrete
   (UHPC) on top and either a sheet of Carbon FRP (CFRP) or Steel FRP
   (SFRP) on the bottom of the beam. Four hybrid FRP-UHPC beams were tested
   along with one control GFRP hollow box beam under four-point static
   flexural loading. Two types of beams were tested (Phase I and Phase II),
   which incorporated different connection mechanisms at the GFRP-UHPC
   interface. It was concluded that the hybrid beams had higher flexural
   strength and stiffness than the control beam, where the beams reinforced
   with SFRP showed greater percent cost effectiveness than beams
   reinforced with CFRP. In addition, the improved connection mechanism
   used in Phase II beams was found to provide adequate interface bond
   strength to maintain full composite action until ultimate failure. (C)

Title = {{Life cycle assessment of CO2 sequestration in magnesium silicate rock -
   A comparative study}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the energy and environmental implications of
   sequestrating CO2 from a coal power plant using magnesium silicate rock.
   An accounting type life cycle assessment (LCA) of the mineralization
   method under development at Abo Akademi University (AAU), Finland, is
   presented and the results are compared with the process developed at the
   National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), formerly Albany Research
   Council (ARC) in the US. The AAU process is a multi-staged route where
   CO2 is sequestered via a process that first produces magnesium
   hydroxide. Mg(OH)(2) from Mg silicate. The Mg(OH)(2) produced is later
   reacted with CO2 in a high temperature gas/solid pressurized fluidized
   bed (FB) reactor, forming pure, stable and environmentally benign MgCO3
   product. This study addresses the following important issues; (a) the
   material and energy requirements of sequestering 1 ton of CO2 (t-CO2) in
   mineral silicate, (b) the overall environmental burdens associated with
   CO2 sequestration using serpentinite mineral, (c) the priorities and
   opportunities for reduction of energy requirements and environmental
   impacts associated with mineralizing CO2, and (d) comparison of LCA
   results of the AAU mineralization process route with that of the
   mineralization process developed by NETL. Exergy calculations show that
   with heat recovery mineralizing 1 t-CO2 using the AAU process requires
   3.6 GJ/t-CO2 while that of the NETL needs 3.4 GJ/t-CO2. Applying results
   of exergy analysis in the life cycle inventory (LCI) models of the AAU
   and the NETL processes leads to 517 kg CO(2)e and 683 kg CO(2)e of
   greenhouse gas emissions (in CO2 equivalents) respectively, for every
   ton of CO2 mineralized in serpentinite. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In the manufacturing industry, there is a growing need for an adaptable
   automated visual inspection (AVI) system that can be used to perform
   different inspection tasks without excessive retuning or retraining
   efforts. This paper presents an automated visual inspection scheme to
   improve the adaptability of an AVI system. In doing so, we propose the
   design of an adaptable inspection model composed of two sub-models: one
   for localizing the region of useful features and the other for defect
   classification. The localization sub-model contains invariant features
   common to all inspection samples. Through an edge-based geometric
   template-matching process, the localization sub-model is used to locate
   a verification region containing the subject of inspection such as a
   clip or a screw in an assembly piece. Through principal component
   analysis (PCA), the verification sub-model is constructed based on the
   reconstruction error distribution of non-defective samples.
   Consequently, this sub-model can be used to identify defective samples.
   In addition, an efficient online training algorithm is proposed for the
   construction of the verification sub-model during system operation. This
   algorithm allows minimum manual inspection effort while ensuring model
   training sufficiency. Through case study, the proposed AVI scheme
   demonstrates its capability of self-tuning while inspecting different
   parts or under different operating conditions in an assembly process.
   The feature of adaptability will help increase the benefit and
   functionality of an AVI technique to the manufacturing industry.}},

Abstract = {{The appearance of highly resistant bacterial biofilms in both community
   and hospitals environments is a major challenge in modern clinical
   medicine. The biofilm structural morphology, believed to be an important
   factor affecting the behavioral properties of these ``super bugs{''}, is
   strongly influenced by the local hydrodynamics over the microcolonies.
   Despite the common use of agitated well plates in the biology community,
   they have been used rather blindly without knowing the flow
   characteristics and influence of the rotational speed and fluid volume
   in these containers. The main purpose of this study is to characterize
   the flow in these high-throughput devices to link local hydrodynamics to
   observed behavior in cell cultures. In this work, the flow and wall
   shear stress distribution in six-well culture plates under planar
   orbital translation is simulated using Computational Fluid Dynamics
   (CFD). Free surface, flow pattern and wall shear stress for two shaker
   speeds (100 and 200 rpm) and two volumes of fluid (2 and 4 mL) were
   investigated. Measurements with a non-intrusive optical shear stress
   sensor and High Frame-rate Particle Imaging Velocimetry (HFPIV) are used
   to validate CFD predictions. An analytical model to predict the free
   surface shape is proposed. Results show a complex three-dimensional flow
   pattern, varying in both time and space. The distribution of wall shear
   stress in these culture plates has been related to the topology of flow.
   This understanding helps explain observed endothelial cell orientation
   and bacterial biofilm distributions observed in culture dishes. The
   results suggest that the mean surface stress field is insufficient to
   capture the underlying dynamics mitigating biological processes.}},
