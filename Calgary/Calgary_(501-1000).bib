Abstract = {{This paper measures the heat energy consumption in a typical Canadian
   house taking into account a commonly used forced air gas furnace. The
   aim of this work is to measure and analyze the possible energy savings
   for homes if zonal heat control system is used. A control circuit is
   used to sense the indoor and outdoor temperature and turns the furnace
   ON or OFF according to the preferred temperature set by the
   householders. Zonal heat control is performed by closing the heating
   vents in the unoccupied areas of the house during the nighttime. Over
   one-month test period in winter, the measurement results proved that the
   zonal control system could save the heating energy up to 36\% depending
   on the weather temperature. The study results support the assumption
   that, more saving in energy consumption can be reached by controlling
   the delivery of heat on a zone-by-zone basis.}},

Abstract = {{The Cole impedance model is widely used in applications involving the
   electrical impedance of biological tissues. Typically requiring
   post-processing to determine its four parameters from electrical
   impedance measurements. Here, a non-linear least squares optimization
   routine is applied to extract the Cole impedance parameters from
   collected magnitude responses (not requiring direct impedance
   measurements). The aim is to quantify the impact of the measured
   frequency range, number of collected datapoints, and level of noise in
   the magnitude-only measurements on the accuracy of the extracted
   parameters. Further investigating the impact the optimization settings
   have on the accuracy and time required to extract the parameters. The
   aim is to understand these factors' effects towards the implementation
   of embedded systems utilizing this method to extract the impedance
   parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Both surgical simulation and robot-assisted surgery require haptic
   models of tool-tissue interaction for force rendering. Most efforts of
   haptic modeling have focused on characterizing tool-tissue interaction
   of soft-tissue indentation, insertion and cutting. Less attention has
   been devoted to soft-tissue dissection however. For the dissection,
   haptic models remain elusive to meet two requirements as: to represent
   nonlinearity of soft-tissue responses and to comply with the time
   constraint of 1 ms for force rendering. Hence, this paper presents a
   modeling framework towards developing an analytic haptic model for force
   rendering of the dissection. Based on estimation theories, the framework
   devises an analytic model to approximate an empirical force-distance
   profile of the dissection. Applying the framework to 2 different
   empirical profiles as use cases, the derived models estimated about 72
   \% and 91\% of the empirical data, respectively. Algorithm
   implementation of these models in Matlab yielded a computational time of
   about 24 Its, much less than 1 ms. The outcomes indicate a potential of
   using the framework to develop an analytic haptic model for force
   rendering of soft-tissue dissection.}},

Abstract = {{Visualization of flow features, such as vortices, aids in analyzing
   complex unsteady (turbulent) flows and thus facilitate human cognition
   of flow phenomena. Typical data of unsteady flows are vector fields of
   velocity in four spatiotemporal dimensions (4D). Often empirical data of
   unsteady flows suffer from unknown measurement errors (i. e., undesired
   vectors). The undesired vectors lead to clutter in visualization. The
   clutter degrades information content and obstructs user interaction for
   analyses. As a feasibility study, this paper presents adaptive
   nonparametric approach (ANPA) to pre-process threedimensional (3D) flow
   data at individual time frames. The preprocessing aimed to eliminate
   undesired vectors in the data. Tested on 4 empirical datasets with
   different intensities of vortex shedding, ANPA reduced undesired
   vectors, and thereby visual clutter, from the flow data without
   distorting vortices. The reduction was quantifiable by the decreased
   number of false positives in vortex identification. These observations
   indicate a potential to extend ANPA to pre-process 4D flow data for
   vortex visualization.}},

   conducted at 23 locations in Calgary and area, including a mix of

   industrial, scientific, and medical devices (2.4-2.5GHz, 5.150-5.875GHz)
   using a spectrum analyzer. A best case test scenario where an active RF
   source was nearby a user was also conducted. It was found that RF energy
   at the measurement locations is generally too low or too inconsistent
   for energy harvesting. Analysis of measurement data reveals that up to
   37\% and 11\% of the locations can attain a peak power of at least
   -30dBm and -20dBm, respectively. However, ambient RF harvesting is
   probably feasible with an active source nearby. The findings open the

   complexity reduction provided by the TNTB model in comparison with the

   the context of adaptive parameter-estimation as it leads to better
   normalized mean squared error while requiring a substantially lower
   number of parameters. Furthermore, the TNTB model requires less
   parameters for its identification, and thus less power consumption for
   its estimation. This makes this model suitable for implementation in

Abstract = {{This paper presents a design process to integrate a magnetic gear with
   an induction machines. The resulting integrated machine has the
   potential to offer a high torque density with asynchronous speed
   characteristics. Such characteristics may be desirable for applications
   that require sensorless operation or may be subject to severe backlash
   or jamming. The paper presents some of the difficulties in the design
   process as compared to the design process for PM machines. A prototype
   design at small scale is developed, and simulation results demonstrate
   the potential for high torque density low-speed high-torque induction
   motor.}},

Abstract = {{A sequential recourse stochastic optimization approach to solving the
   long-term integrated planning problem of a Natural Gas (NG) distribution
   system and Natural Gas-fired Distributed Generators (NGDGs) is
   presented. The NGDG location and sizing problem under uncertain demand
   is solved in the first stage. The computed location and size of NGDG is
   employed to compute the NG demand at each node. The deterministic mixed
   integer non-linear programming NG optimal pipeline route selection
   problem is solved in the second stage. The solution methodology is
   illustrated using a simple case study over a long term planning period
   of 20 years. This work extends previous heuristic based approaches
   dependent on consideration of limited candidate solutions by employing a
   two stage recourse stochastic optimization technique and an analytical
   solution technique for solving the integrated problem. The proposed
   model allows for planning the future integration of NGDG and
   NG-pipelines without having to populate a set of expansion options.}},

Abstract = {{Facial biometrics, specifically facial expression analysis, is one of
   the most actively investigated topics towards the creation of an
   automated system capable of detecting and classifying pain in human
   subjects. This paper presents a comparative analysis of Gabor energy
   filter based approaches combined with powerful classifiers, such as
   Support Vector Machines, for pain detection and classification into
   three levels. The intensity of pain is labelled using the Prkachin and
   Solomon Pain Intensity scale. In this paper, the levels of intensity
   have been quantized into three disjoint groups: no pain, weak pain and
   strong pain. The results of experiments show that Gabor energy filters
   provide comparable or better results compared to previous filter-based
   pain recognition methods, with a 74\% classification rate of pain versus
   no pain, and 74\%, 30\% and 78\% precision rates when distinguishing
   pain into no pain, weak pain and strong pain respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The IEEE 802.15.4 standard for the Low Rate Wireless Personal Area
   Networks (LR-WPANs) is popular and widely used for many areas of

   adopted a Binary Exponential Backoff (BEB) algorithm. In this paper, we
   investigate the saturation throughput of this standard using the
   existing BEB algorithm and compare it with three other backoff schemes -
   Exponential Increase Exponential Decrease (EIED), Exponential Increase
   Linear Decrease (EILD) and Exponential Increase Multiplicative Decrease
   (EIMD) algorithms. From the simulation results, it is found that EIED,
   EILD and EIMD perform better than the BEB for the higher loads. The EIED
   produces the highest throughput among all of these schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Heart activity, or at least heart rate variability, is associated with
   body position. Our previous studies have confirmed that impedance
   pneumography may be used to record respiratory function, but the

   collected from 24 students (12 male, 12 female), who alternated
   positions between lying (on front, back, and right side), sitting and
   standing. Signals from an attached iPhone's internal sensors
   (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) were recorded and attitude
   relative to gravity was calculated. The signals were subsequently
   segmented and marked. Five algorithms were trained and cross-validated
   for different sensor combinations. Without differentiation of sitting
   and standing, 100 \% accuracy was achieved using all algorithms. The
   classifier best differentiating these two states was based on random
   forests, with overall accuracy of 90 \%. Simple methods based on a
   proposed hybrid classifier were tested for online measurement without
   the need for signal segmentation, with 99 \% accuracy. The prospect of
   the algorithms' use in long-term studies (particularly cardiorespiratory
   monitoring) was assessed.}},

Abstract = {{Acne can lead to severe physical and psychological implications on
   chronic sufferers if not treated promptly and properly. Ramli et al.
   proposed a k-means cluster based algorithm to provide computer-assisted
   support for the manual grading of digital images. We propose an
   improved, automated, and more objective, grading method which involves
   optimizing the k-means clustering algorithm by identifying the actual
   number of clusters rather than basing analysis on a fixed K= 3
   assumption for all images. The Hough transform was used to further
   analyze the found acne cluster leading to an approach to more accurately
   automatically determine the number and type of lesions. A quantitative
   comparison of the two approaches showed that the new approach provided a
   better match to the stated specialist analysis. We found it
   inappropriate to use accuracy and specificity performance analysis
   metrics to compare the algorithms. A better matching of the algorithms'
   accuracy to the specialist's analysis of the skin condition was found by
   modifying the sensitivity metric to account for the Michelson acne
   grading scale. This robustness suggests that the tool might be a
   first-step towards patient self-monitoring between visits to a
   specialist; potentially reducing visits frequency, decreasing wait
   times, and lead to a definitive standardized assessment scale.}},

Abstract = {{When identifying all modules in a dynamic network it is natural to treat
   all node variables in a symmetric way, i.e. not having pre-assigned
   roles of `inputs' and `outputs'. In a prediction error setting this
   implies that every node signal is predicted on the basis of all other
   nodes. A usual restriction in direct and joint-io methods for dynamic
   network and closed loop identification is the need for a delay to be
   present in every loop (absence of algebraic loops). It is shown that the
   classical one-step-ahead predictor that incorporates direct feedthrough
   terms in models can not be used in a dynamic network setting. It has to
   be replaced by a network predictor, for which consistency results are
   shown when applied in a direct identification method. The result is a
   one-stage direct/joint-io method that can handle the presence of
   algebraic loops. It is illustrated that the identified models have
   improved variance properties over instrumental variable estimation
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{Structural interference signals can severely jeopardize the performance
   of GNSS receivers which may lead to serious consequences for scores of
   applications. This type of interference is designed to be very similar
   to the authentic GNSS signals; therefore, it is very difficult for a
   conventional receiver to discriminate them from genuine observations.
   This research focuses on the application of a carrier phase capable dual
   antenna receiver (or two spatially separated receivers) to allow
   authenticity verification and reliable measurements classification.
   Assuming that all counterfeit PRNs originate from the same source, the
   proposed method identifies fake measurements based on their time
   invariant carrier phase double differences. The proposed detection
   procedure is based on a combination of GLRT and graph theory formulated
   to classify counterfeit and authentic signals and to reduce the
   authenticity verification time. Simulations and real-data processing
   results verify that the proposed technique can successfully classify the
   authentic and counterfeit measurements within a few minutes. The
   real-world performance of this method has also been verified on carrier
   phase capable GNSS receivers. The theoretical analyses and processing
   results show that the performance of this technique improves as the
   observation interval or receiver antenna spacing increases.}},

Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{604-630}},
Abstract = {{Agricultural drought is a natural hazard that can be characterized by
   shortage of water supply. In the scope of this paper, we synthesized the
   importance of agricultural drought and methods commonly employed to
   monitor agricultural drought conditions. These include: (i) in-situ
   based methods, (ii) optical remote sensing methods, (iii) thermal remote
   sensing methods, (iv) microwave remote sensing methods, (v) combined
   remote sensing methods, and (vi) synergy between in-situ and remote
   sensing based methods. The in-situ indices can provide accurate results
   at the point of measurements; however, unable to provide spatial
   dynamics over large area. This can potentially be addressed by using
   remote sensing based methods because remote sensing platforms have the
   ability to view large area at a near continuous fashion. The remote
   sensing derived agricultural drought related indicators primarily depend
   on the characteristics of reflected/emitted energy from the earth
   surface, thus the results can be relatively less accurate in comparison
   to the in-situ derived outcomes. Despite a significant amount of
   research and development has been accomplished in particular to the area
   of remote sensing of agricultural drought, still there are several
   challenges. Those include: monitoring relatively small area, filling
   gaps in the data, developing consistent historical dataset, developing
   remote sensing-based agricultural drought forecasting system,
   integrating the recently launched and upcoming remote sensors, and
   developing standard validation schema, among others.}},

Abstract = {{In many applications of roller bearing fault diagnosis, such as in wind
   turbine, shaft rotational speed varies with respect to time, and
   consequently the normal frequency domain analysis, which is valid for
   constant speed condition, cannot be used in principal. Alternatively,
   order tracking in conjunction with phase demodulation has been used to
   estimate the shaft speed and resample the time domain signal into
   angular domain. Speed estimation using phase demodulation has been
   mainly used for gearbox application where a reference signal or a shaft
   harmonic is well defined. In this paper, an Empirical Mode Decomposition
   based approach for shaft speed estimation is examined. The estimated
   instantaneous shaft phase is then used for order tracking to capture the
   bearing fault diagnosis, under variable speed profile. The approach is
   applied on a simulated bearing signal having an outer race fault, and
   then on operational low signal noise ratio vibration data of 1.5 MW wind
   turbine. The most suitable decomposed mode is selected to eliminate the
   effect of unwanted components from other drive-train rotating elements
   as well as noise from the acquired vibration signal.}},

Title = {{Effects of glycerol on the minimization of water readsorption on
   sub-bituminous coal}},
Journal = {{DRYING TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{249-260}},
Abstract = {{The presence of water in coal presents a technological challenge for its
   industrial use in energetic processes. Water tends to negatively affect
   the coal quality and its net heating value (NHV), in addition to
   affecting its transportation costs. Therefore, this study aims to
   investigate the effects of glycerol and temperature on water adsorption
   onto systematically modified coals. A Colombian bituminous coal sample
   was used as support for being modified with glycerol. The virgin coal
   and modified coal were characterized by nitrogen adsorption at 77K
   (S-BET), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared
   (FT-IR) spectroscopy, elemental analysis (C-H-N elemental), and
   thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results showed that the water
   uptake decreased as the amount of glycerol on the coal surface
   increased. The optimum concentration of 8wt\% of glycerol impregnated on
   the coal minimized water adsorption. Over a range of water activity
   evaluations, this amount of glycerol (C8) reduced water adsorption by
   approximately 60\% compared with nonimpregnated coal (C0). As expected,
   water uptake decreased with increasing temperature. These results are
   reflected in the NHV with an increase of 17\% for the C8 sample compared
   with the other samples evaluated. The Talu and Meunier model was used to
   fit the experimental adsorption isotherms, and the mean square root
   error (MSRE\%) was lower than 10\%. The isosteric heat of sorption (IHS)
   for coal tends to decrease as the amount of adsorbed water increases. In
   addition, the value of IHS decreases as the concentration of glycerol
   increases due to the blocking of polar adsorption sites present on the
   coal surface, which are the main regions of low uptake of adsorbed
   water. Additionally, the Gibbs free energy was found to have negative
   values, which corroborates the spontaneous adsorption process.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the necessity of accurate 3D surface reconstruction has
   been more pronounced for a wide range of mapping, modelling, and
   monitoring applications. The 3D data for satisfying the needs of these
   applications can be collected using different digital imaging systems.
   Among them, photogrammetric systems have recently received considerable
   attention due to significant improvements in digital imaging sensors,
   emergence of new mapping platforms, and development of innovative data
   processing techniques. To date, a variety of techniques haven been
   proposed for 3D surface reconstruction using imagery collected by
   multi-platform photogrammetric systems. However, these approaches suffer
   from the lack of a well-established quality control procedure which
   evaluates the quality of reconstructed 3D surfaces independent of the
   utilized reconstruction technique. Hence, this paper aims to introduce a
   new quality assessment platform for the evaluation of the 3D surface
   reconstruction using photogrammetric data. This quality control
   procedure is performed while considering the quality of input data,
   processing procedures, and photo-realistic 3D surface modelling. The
   feasibility of the proposed quality control procedure is finally
   verified by quality assessment of the 3D surface reconstruction using
   images from different photogrammetric systems.}},

Abstract = {{The last few years have witnessed an increasing volume of aerial image
   data because of the extensive improvements of the Unmanned Aerial
   Vehicles (UAVs). These newly developed UAVs have led to a wide variety
   of applications. A fast assessment of the achieved coverage and overlap
   of the acquired images of a UAV flight mission is of great help to save
   the time and cost of the further steps. A fast automatic stitching of
   the acquired images can help to visually assess the achieved coverage
   and overlap during the flight mission. This paper proposes an automatic
   image stitching approach that creates a single overview stitched image
   using the acquired images during a UAV flight mission along with a
   coverage image that represents the count of overlaps between the
   acquired images. The main challenge of such task is the huge number of
   images that are typically involved in such scenarios. A short flight
   mission with image acquisition frequency of one second can capture
   hundreds to thousands of images. The main focus of the proposed approach
   is to reduce the processing time of the image stitching procedure by
   exploiting the initial knowledge about the images positions provided by
   the navigation sensors. The proposed approach also avoids solving for
   all the transformation parameters of all the photos together to save the
   expected long computation time if all the parameters were considered
   simultaneously. After extracting the points of interest of all the
   involved images using Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)
   algorithm, the proposed approach uses the initial image's coordinates to
   build an incremental constrained Delaunay triangulation that represents
   the neighborhood of each image. This triangulation helps to match only
   the neighbor images and therefore reduces the time-consuming features
   matching step. The estimated relative orientation between the matched
   images is used to find a candidate seed image for the stitching process.
   The pre-estimated transformation parameters of the images are employed
   successively in a growing fashion to create the stitched image and the
   coverage image. The proposed approach is implemented and tested using
   the images acquired through a UAV flight mission and the achieved
   results are presented and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Flying in gusty winds with a mini-UAV has always been a challenge as the
   moment of inertia and weight of the vehicle is typically low. In order
   to improve the flight quality of the mini-UAV, a flexible membrane wing
   has been fabricated with added desirable features. This wing is able to
   dampen the high-frequency gusts via the adaptive washout and also fold
   along the fuselage for quick storage and deployment. However, the
   actuation of the wing for roll control is difficult if these two
   properties are not to be compromised. A novel method of wing warping for
   roll control with a tendon-sheath has been investigated. The
   nonlinearities of the tendon-sheath mechanism require extra control
   strategies for accurate wing warping control. The nonlinear
   characteristics of the wing warping via tendon-sheath has been examined,
   and a suitable model is designed and implemented in a controller to
   compensate for the nonlinearity. The performance and robustness of the
   system is subsequently tested in gusty conditioned wind tunnel with
   satisfactory results.}},

Abstract = {{In the last few years, multi-cameras and LIDAR systems draw the
   attention of the mapping community. They have been deployed on different
   mobile mapping platforms. The different uses of these platforms,
   especially the UAVs, offered new applications and developments which
   require fast and accurate results. The successful calibration of such
   systems is a key factor to achieve accurate results and for the
   successful processing of the system measurements especially with the
   different types of measurements provided by the LIDAR and the cameras.
   The system calibration aims to estimate the geometric relationships
   between the different system components. A number of applications
   require the systems be ready for operation in a short time especially
   for disasters monitoring applications. Also, many of the present system
   calibration techniques are constrained with the need of special
   arrangements in labs for the calibration procedures. In this paper, a
   new technique for calibration of integrated LIDAR and multi-cameras
   systems is presented. The new proposed technique offers a calibration
   solution that overcomes the need for special labs for standard
   calibration procedures. In the proposed technique, 3D reconstruction of
   automatically detected and matched image points is used to generate a
   sparse images driven point cloud then, a registration between the LIDAR
   generated 3D point cloud and the images-driven 3D point takes place to
   estimate the geometric relationships between the cameras and the LIDAR..
   In the presented technique a simple 3D artificial target is used to
   simplify the lab requirements for the calibration procedure. The used
   target is composed of three intersected plates. The choice of such
   target geometry was to ensure enough conditions for the convergence of
   registration between the constructed 3D point clouds from the two
   systems. The achieved results of the proposed approach prove its ability
   to provide an adequate and fully automated calibration without
   sophisticated calibration arrangement requirements. The proposed
   technique introduces high potential for system calibration for many
   applications especially those with critical logistic and time
   constraints such as in disaster monitoring applications.}},

Abstract = {{Object detection and recognition from LiDAR (Light Detection And
   Ranging) data has been a research topic in the fields of photogrammetry
   and computer vision. Unlike point clouds collected in well-controlled
   indoor environments, point clouds in urban environments are more complex
   due to complexity of the real world. For example, trees sometimes close
   to signs or buildings, which will cause occlusions in the point clouds.
   Current object detection or reconstruction algorithms will have problems
   when recognizing objects with severe occlusions caused by trees etc. In
   this paper, a robust vegetation removal method and a DBSCAN based
   pole-like object detection method are proposed. Based on observation
   that major difference between vegetation and other rigid objects is
   their penetrability with respect to LiDAR, we introduce a local
   roughness measure to differentiate rigid objects from non-rigid ones
   (vegetation in this paper). First, a local sphere with a small radius is
   generated for each input point. Three principal components of the local
   sphere are then calculated, and a plane is determined. The roughness is
   obtained through calculating the standard deviation of distances from
   all inside points to the plane by a weighted summation of the normalized
   distances. The further the point to the plane, the smaller the weight
   is. Finally, a graph cuts based method is introduced to classify the
   input point sets into two groups. The data term is defined by the
   normalized roughness of the current point, and the smoothness term is
   defined by the normalized distance between the point and its nearest
   neighbour point. In terms of pole-like object detection, first, a
   uniformed 2D grid is generated through projecting all the points to the
   XY-plane. The seed points of the pole-like objects are obtained by
   determining the x and y coordinates by the centres of the highest
   density cells of the grid and the z coordinate by the mean height of the
   point sets of each object. Finally, a DBSCAN based method is introduced
   to obtain the rest points of each pole -like object. Experimental
   results show that the proposed vegetation removal method achieves
   state-of-the-art results from both mobile LiDAR and airborne LiDAR data.
   The proposed pole-like object detection approach turns out to be very
   efficient.}},

Abstract = {{Landslides are among the major threats to urban landscape and manmade
   infrastructure. They often cause economic losses, property damages, and
   loss of lives. Temporal monitoring data of landslides from different
   epochs empowers the evaluation of landslide progression. Alignment of
   overlapping surfaces from two or more epochs is crucial for the proper
   analysis of landslide dynamics. The traditional methods for
   point-cloud-based landslide monitoring rely on using a variation of the
   Iterative Closest Point (ICP) registration procedure to align any
   reconstructed surfaces from different epochs to a common reference
   frame. However, sometimes the ICP-based registration can fail or may not
   provide sufficient accuracy. For example, point clouds from different
   epochs might fit to local minima due to lack of geometrical variability
   within the data. Also, manual interaction is required to exclude any
   non-stable areas from the registration process. In this paper, a robust
   image-based registration method is introduced for the simultaneous
   evaluation of all registration parameters. This includes the Interior
   Orientation Parameters (IOPs) of the camera and the Exterior Orientation
   Parameters (EOPs) of the involved images from all available observation
   epochs via a bundle block adjustment with self calibration. Next, a
   semi-global dense matching technique is implemented to generate dense 3D
   point clouds for each epoch using the images captured in a particular
   epoch separately. The normal distances between any two consecutive point
   clouds can then be readily computed, because the point clouds are
   already effectively co-registered. A low-cost DJI Phantom II Unmanned
   Aerial Vehicle (UAV) was customised and used in this research for
   temporal data collection over an active soil creep area in Lethbridge,
   Alberta, Canada. The customisation included adding a GPS logger and a
   Large-Field-Of-View (LFOV) action camera which facilitated capturing
   high-resolution geo-tagged images in two epochs over the period of one
   year (i.e., May 2014 and May 2015). Note that due to the coarse accuracy
   of the on-board GPS receiver (e.g., +/- 5-10 m) the geo-tagged positions
   of the images were only used as initial values in the bundle block
   adjustment. Normal distances, signifying detected changes, varying from
   20 cm to 4 m were identified between the two epochs. The accuracy of the
   co-registered surfaces was estimated by comparing non-active patches
   within the monitored area of interest. Since these non-active sub-areas
   are stationary, the computed normal distances should theoretically be
   close to zero. The quality control of the registration results showed
   that the average normal distance was approximately 4 cm, which is within
   the noise level of the reconstructed surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Depth information is widely used for representation, reconstruction and
   modeling of 3D scene. Generally two kinds of methods can obtain the
   depth information. One is to use the distance cues from the depth
   camera, but the results heavily depend on the device, and the accuracy
   is degraded greatly when the distance from the object is increased. The
   other one uses the binocular cues from the matching to obtain the depth
   information. It is more and more mature and convenient to collect the
   depth information of different scenes by stereo matching methods. In the
   objective function, the data term is to ensure that the difference
   between the matched pixels is small, and the smoothness term is to
   smooth the neighbors with different disparities. Nonetheless, the
   smoothness term blurs the boundary depth information of the object which
   becomes the bottleneck of the stereo matching. This paper proposes a
   novel energy function for the boundary to keep the discontinuities and
   uses the Hopfield neural network to solve the optimization. We first
   extract the region of interest areas which are the boundary pixels in
   original images. Then, we develop the boundary energy function to
   calculate the matching cost. At last, we solve the optimization globally
   by the Hopfield neural network. The Middlebury stereo benchmark is used
   to test the proposed method, and results show that our boundary depth
   information is more accurate than other state-of-the-art methods and can
   be used to optimize the results of other stereo matching methods.}},

Abstract = {{The automation of unmanned vehicle operation has gained a lot of
   research attention, in the last few years, because of its numerous
   applications. The vehicle localization is more challenging in indoor
   environments where absolute positioning measurements (e.g. GPS) are
   typically unavailable. Laser range finders are among the most widely
   used sensors that help the unmanned vehicles to localize themselves in
   indoor environments. Typically, automatic real-time matching of the
   successive scans is performed either explicitly or implicitly by any
   localization approach that utilizes laser range finders. Many accustomed
   approaches such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP), Iterative Matching
   Range Point (IMRP), Iterative Dual Correspondence (IDC), and Polar Scan
   Matching (PSM) handles the scan matching problem in an iterative fashion
   which significantly affects the time consumption. Furthermore, the
   solution convergence is not guaranteed especially in cases of sharp
   maneuvers or fast movement. This paper proposes an automated real-time
   scan matching algorithm where the matching process is initialized using
   the detected corners. This initialization step aims to increase the
   convergence probability and to limit the number of iterations needed to
   reach convergence. The corner detection is preceded by line extraction
   from the laser scans. To evaluate the probability of line availability
   in indoor environments, various data sets, offered by different research
   groups, have been tested and the mean numbers of extracted lines per
   scan for these data sets are ranging from 4.10 to 8.86 lines of more
   than 7 points. The set of all intersections between extracted lines are
   detected as corners regardless of the physical intersection of these
   line segments in the scan. To account for the uncertainties of the
   detected corners, the covariance of the corners is estimated using the
   extracted lines variances. The detected corners are used to estimate the
   transformation parameters between the successive scan using least
   squares. These estimated transformation parameters are used to calculate
   an adjusted initialization for scan matching process. The presented
   method can be employed solely to match the successive scans and also can
   be used to aid other accustomed iterative methods to achieve more
   effective and faster converge. The performance and time consumption of
   the proposed approach is compared with ICP algorithm alone without
   initialization in different scenarios such as static period, fast
   straight movement, and sharp manoeuvers.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new technique for increasing the accuracy of
   direct geo-referenced image-based 3D point cloud generated from low-cost
   sensors in smartphones. The smartphone's motion sensors are used to
   directly acquire the Exterior Orientation Parameters (EOPs) of the
   captured images. These EOPs, along with the Interior Orientation
   Parameters (IOPs) of the camera/phone, are used to reconstruct the
   image-based 3D point cloud. However, because smartphone motion sensors
   suffer from poor GPS accuracy, accumulated drift and high signal noise,
   inaccurate 3D mapping solutions often result. Therefore, horizontal and
   vertical linear features, visible in each image, are extracted and used
   as constraints in the bundle adjustment procedure. These constraints
   correct the relative position and orientation of the 3D mapping
   solution. Once the enhanced EOPs are estimated, the semi-global matching
   algorithm (SGM) is used to generate the image-based dense 3D point
   cloud. Statistical analysis and assessment are implemented herein, in
   order to demonstrate the feasibility of 3D point cloud generation from
   the consumer-grade sensors in smartphones.}},

Abstract = {{High-speed dual fluoroscopy (DF) imaging provides a novel, in-vivo
   solution to quantify the six-degree-of-freedom skeletal kinematics of
   humans and animals with sub-millimetre accuracy and high temporal
   resolution. A rigorous geometric calibration of DF system parameters is
   essential to ensure precise bony rotation and translation measurements.
   One way to achieve the system calibration is by performing a bundle
   adjustment with self-calibration. A first-time bundle adjustment-based
   system calibration was recently achieved. The system calibration through
   the bundle adjustment has been shown to be robust, precise, and
   straightforward. Nevertheless, due to the inherent absence of
   colour/semantic information in DF images, a significant amount of user
   input is needed to prepare the image observations for the bundle
   adjustment. This paper introduces a semi-automated methodology to
   minimise the amount of user input required to process calibration images
   and henceforth to facilitate the calibration task. The methodology is
   optimized for processing images acquired over a custom-made calibration
   frame with radio-opaque spherical targets. Canny edge detection is used
   to find distinct structural components of the calibration images.
   Edge-linking is applied to cluster the edge pixels into unique groups.
   Principal components analysis is utilized to automatically detect the
   calibration targets from the groups and to filter out possible outliers.
   Ellipse fitting is utilized to achieve the spatial measurements as well
   as to perform quality analysis over the detected targets. Single photo
   resection is used together with a template matching procedure to
   establish the image-to-object point correspondence and to simplify
   target identification. The proposed methodology provided 56,254
   identified-targets from 411 images that were used to run a second-time
   bundle adjustment-based DF system calibration. Compared to a previous
   fully manual procedure, the proposed methodology has significantly
   reduced the amount of user input needed for processing the calibration
   images. In addition, the bundle adjustment calibration has reported a
   50\% improvement in terms of image observation residuals.}},

   Student Consortium (SC) is a network for young professionals studying or
   working within the fields of photogrammetry, remote sensing,
   Geographical Information Systems (GIS), and other related geo-spatial
   sciences. The main goal of the network is to provide means for
   information exchange for its young members and thus help promote and
   integrate youth into the ISPRS. Over the past four years the Student
   Consortium has successfully continued to fulfil its mission in both
   formal and informal ways. The formal means of communication of the SC
   are its website, newsletter, e-mail announcements and summer schools,
   while its informal ones are multiple social media outlets and various
   social activities during student related events. The newsletter is
   published every three to four months and provides both technical and
   experiential content relevant for the young people in the ISPRS. The SC
   has been in charge or at least has helped with organizing one or more
   summer schools every year. The organization's e-mail list has over 1,100
   subscribers, its website hosts over 1,300 members from 100 countries
   across the entire globe, and its public Facebook group currently has
   over 4,500 joined visitors, who connect among one another and share
   information relevant for their professional careers. These numbers show
   that the Student Consortium has grown into a significant online-united
   community. The paper will present the organization's on-going and past
   activities for the last four years, its current priorities and a
   strategic plan and aspirations for the future four-year period.}},

Abstract = {{The Cognitive Radio (CR) is a fully-reconfigurable wireless device that
   can intelligently sense, manage, and exploit temporarily-vacant licensed
   spectrum bands during the absence of incumbent users. Broadly, the IEEE
   802.22 is the first complete Wireless Regional Area Network (WRAN)
   standard that utilizes CR technology in the opportunistic access of
   white spaces in the television (TV) bands. Intrinsically, the increased
   CR networks' vulnerabilities alongside the experienced growth of
   attackers' capabilities, creates a strain on CR network designers to act
   accordingly. However, most of the existing efforts solely examined the
   issues of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks of IEEE 802.22 networks, such
   as Primary User Emulation (PUE) attack and Spectrum Sensing Data
   Falsification (SSDF) attack, each treated in isolation. One main
   challenge in CR network security domain is to efficiently represent
   possible simultaneous multiple security threats, and assess their
   effects. Unlike the previous works, this paper addresses the
   aforementioned challenge through using the holistic approach of
   assessing the combined effect of simultaneous multiple DoS attacks. The
   Bayesian Attack Graph (BAG) model is utilized in this paper to capture
   the probabilistic dependencies among IEEE 802.22 DoS threat-environment
   and known vulnerabilities. The simulation results indicate up to 51.3\%
   increase in the probability of DoS in IEEE 802.22 networks considering
   simultaneous multiple attacks in comparison to the most severe sole
   attack. Finally, the paper introduces the BAG model as a feasible CR
   vulnerability metric that can facilitate the creation of a security
   tightening plan.}},

   possible while leaving the energy reserve untouched increases deployment
   time and reliability. The controller being optimized was a Takagi-Sugeno
   fuzzy controller with inputs for the state of the energy buffer and a
   forecast of current day solar energy available for harvest. Two types of
   forecasts were used: one ideal and another based on atmospheric pressure
   measurements. Compared to a human-created reference controller, the
   evolved controller collected 124.96\% of the measurements across the
   network, while only consuming 1.07\% of the energy reserve capacity
   using a perfect forecast with similar results using the pressure-based

Abstract = {{Dynamic Thermal Line Rating (DTLR) incorporates weather conditions
   prevailing on line ampacity to calculate actual current-carrying
   capacity of transmission lines. These weather variables include ambient
   temperature, wind speed, wind direction, and solar intensity. In this
   paper, probability and fuzzy techniques are adopted to model the
   existing uncertainties in weather variables and their performances are
   compared. A transmission line in Alberta's electric system is considered
   as a case study. Weather data are available at nine towers along the
   transmission line. Line sectional ampacities are estimated using
   conductor thermal equations. Results indicate that fuzzy model is able
   to estimate DTLR as efficient as probabilistic model and due to its low
   computational cost can be used for real-time applications. Modeling
   uncertainties in DTLR calculation would enable system operators to make
   decisions on DTLR considering the degree of risk that power utilities

Abstract = {{An approach to evaluating the failure rate of power transformers with
   consideration of inspection and test results is presented. Hazard
   plotting, a conventional statistical method, is used first to find the
   best model that fits the aging failure data. Then, by exploring the
   power transformer's Health Index correlation to age, a method is
   established to adjust its failure rate based on the evaluated condition.
   The study of failed and in service units proves the viability of the
   proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to focus on supply chain quality (SCQ) in the
   hospitality industry in China, and to stress the importance of the
   synergy of quality management (QM) and supply chain management (SCM).
   The authors have investigated the relationship among QM practices, SCM
   practices, SCQ and hotel performance, and examined the effect of
   contextual variables.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study mainly uses a questionnaire
   survey to collect data relating to the research hypotheses. Structural
   equation model technique is suited for our research purposes, and the
   LISREL software is implemented to test the conceptual model.
   Findings - The results show that QM practices and SCM practices are
   significantly correlated. QM practices/SCM practices are positively
   related to SCQ, and consequently influence hotel performance. SCQ has
   the mediating effect between QM/SCM practices and hotel performance.
   Contextual variables truly play a moderator between QM/SCM practices and
   SCQ.
   Research limitations/implications - Hotel managers should look beyond
   their own hotels into supply chain to manage quality, highlight the
   importance of interdepartmental or external (i.e. customers or
   suppliers) connectedness, such as building close and long-term
   relationships with well-chosen suppliers, encouraging customer
   involvement and establishing an effective interface for accumulating
   information regarding customers' needs and feedback. Hotel managers are
   also able to realize the influence of contextual variables (e.g. the new
   normal state of the Chinese economy), and further to gain chance of
   hotel's survival.
   Originality/value - This study focuses on SCQ and tries to fill a gap in
   the exiting literature on SCQ management in hospitality industry.}},

   Fourier power spectrum and spatial variance are adopted to distinguish
   normal optic disks from those affected by neovascularization. The
   two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov nonparametric test is used to evaluate the
   significance of the difference of entropy between normal and abnormal
   optic disks. Based on the computed measures, we employ a linear
   classifier to discriminate normal from abnormal optic disks. The

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{More than half of the total world oil reserves are heavy oil, extra
   heavy oil, and bitumen; however their catalytic conversion to more
   valuable products is challenging. The use of submicronic particles or
   nanoparticles of catalysts suspended in the feedstock may be a viable
   alternative to the conversion of heavy oils at refinery level or
   downhole (in situ upgrading). In the present work, molybdenum sulfide
   (MoS2) particles with varying diameters (10000-10 nm) were prepared
   using polyvinylpyrrolidone as capping agent. The prepared particles were
   characterized by DLS, TEM, XRD, and XPS and tested in the
   hydrodesulfurization (HDS) of a vacuum gas oil (VGO). A correlation
   between particle size and activity is presented. It was found that
   particles with diameters around 13 nm show double the HDS activity
   compared with the material with micrometric particle sizes (diameter
   approximate to 10,000 nm).}},

Abstract = {{Ionospheric scintillations can compromise performance of Radio
   Occultation (RO) missions and their measurements to retrieve geophysical
   parameters (e.g. temperature and pressure). For Global Navigation
   Satellite Systems (GNSS), ionospheric scintillations may induce receiver
   loss of lock or excessive phase noise and reduce GNSS availability for
   RO platforms. Alternatively, measurements of scintillated RO signals can
   be used to derive information about ionospheric irregularities. Real RO
   data from current missions shows significant degradation in receiver
   performance during periods of ionospheric scintillation; thus there is a
   need to investigate and characterize scintillation impact. In this study
   we use an experimental method to extract scintillation perturbations
   from real RO missions and then impose them to non-scintillated simulated
   RO scenarios. Resulting signal contains similar spectral characteristics
   similar to the original scintillated real data. Simulated high rate IF
   samples are then used to investigate performance of a typical commercial
   GNSS receiver under scintillation conditions for RO applications.}},

Abstract = {{In the last decade, there was many advances in indoors navigation
   research, driven mainly by the proliferation of miniaturized and
   low-cost sensors, embedded inside our smartphones, enabling countless
   commercial opportunities, in entertainment, safety, and location based
   services (LBS). Many algorithms and techniques have been proposed to
   mitigate the errors and the drift of these low cost sensors. Some of the
   most recent techniques used for indoors navigation include: pedestrian
   dead reckoning (PDR) techniques, WiFi trilateration, WiFi
   fingerprinting, magnetic matching, map matching techniques, proximity
   sensing of peers, or a combination of some of these methods. Some of
   these methods require an accurate and updated maps of the area of
   interest. Acquiring these maps could be an expensive and time consuming
   process. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that the mapped features
   could be time dependent, requiring regular updates to the maps. As a
   result, some of the recent proposed methods incorporated automatic maps
   generation and update.
   The main objective of this paper is to propose and evaluate a new
   collaborative and multimodal framework for indoors navigation using
   smartphones to mitigate the current limitations of the indoors
   navigation algorithms. This framework unifies the positioning and
   mapping tasks, and uses only smartphones, without requiring previous
   knowledge of the environment, additionally it does not assume the
   existence of any specific infrastructure. In the context of the proposed
   framework, `multimodal' refers to the different types of mapped
   features; such as, metric and topological floorplans, WiFi access point
   location map, WiFi access point power distribution map, and magnetic
   field density map. Additionally, `collaborative' refers to the
   collaboration between different node, and it is defined on two
   dimensions: spatial and temporal. The spatial collaboration takes place
   when two or more nodes are in physical proximity. In this case the range
   information between nodes provides an additional input to the position
   estimation algorithm, which helps in enhancing the precision of the
   position estimate for each of the collaborating nodes. The temporal
   collaboration occurs through building and updating multimodal maps, by
   applying the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technique. In
   this paper the focus will be mainly on WiFi access point received signal
   strength indicator maps. However, the selected map representation is
   easily extended to other features, such as magnetic field intensity
   maps.}},

Abstract = {{Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) has proven to be a viable and
   reliable solution in interference-free environment. However, in urban
   canyons reliable positioning is difficult to achieve in a cost-effective
   manner using standalone GNSS, due to multipath problems and
   Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) signals. In this regard, the authors previously
   proposed a method whereby NLOS signals were used constructively by
   incorporating the information related to nearby reflectors with the help
   of a 3D building model (3DBM). Since the proposed 3DBM-assisted
   algorithm incorporates assistance data with the help of a 3DBM, the
   accuracy of the final estimated position will also depend on the
   accuracy of the assistance data and processing parameters. This research
   investigates the sensitivity of the 3DBM-assisted positioning algorithm
   to various algorithm parameters and is tested using data collected in
   downtown Calgary, Canada. Results confirm that errors in the 3DBM
   increase the error of the final position estimate. For given grid
   resolution, the size of the position grid does not affect the final
   solution. Increasing the grid resolution yields slightly better position
   estimates at the cost of much higher processing load. The algorithm is
   shown to be weakly sensitive to the accuracy of receiver's time
   estimate; even with a timing error of 10 s, the final estimated position
   was unchanged. Finally, the coherent integration time (10 ms vs 100 ms)
   was shown to have very little impact on position accuracy and
   demonstrates the capability of the algorithm to provide good positioning
   accuracy without external data bit aiding even in dense urban
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, stereo visual odometry (VO) aiding to GPS (Global
   Positioning System) is investigated, which was inspired by the
   increasingly widely applied vision-based navigation system. As a
   self-contained system, stereo visual odometry has been validated for
   short-term navigation, which makes it capable of not only providing the
   dynamic information of the land vehicles for GPS positioning, but also
   bridging the outage of GPS in harsh GPS environment. A simplified
   tightly coupled GPS/Stereo visual odometry system is developed using
   Extended Kalman filter (EKF) with error-state to fuse two types of
   datasets. The system model is derived based on the ego-motion estimation
   of stereo visual odometry, while the measurement update in EKF is
   provided by the GPS code and carrier-phase observations. In this way,
   the ego-motion estimation based on images provides the dynamic
   information of land vehicle, and the absolute positioning information of
   GPS signals can mitigate the accumulated errors of visual odometry. PPP
   (Precise Point Positioning) algorithms are applied to improve the
   performance with a single GPS receiver. Two datasets were collected near
   the campus of the University of Calgary in open-sky and harsh scenarios
   with two PixeLINK cameras and a Trimble R8 amounted on a land vehicle.
   In each dataset, approximate 4000 images are recorded with 10 FPS
   (frames per second).
   A base station was also set up on the roof of the Engineering Building
   at the University of Calgary to perform DGPS (Differential GPS), which
   is used as trajectory reference. The results show that with full
   operation of GPS, the GPS measurements dominate the positioning
   accuracy. In harsh environment, the stereo VO mitigated the outage of
   GPS with horizontal error within 20 meters over one minute.}},

Abstract = {{Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) are often used with GNSS, particularly
   in vehicle navigation. GNSS/INS integration is usually used to bridge
   outages in the GNSS solution, for example in urban canyons. Inertial
   observations, being self-contained, are not easily spoofed and can be
   used to authenticate GNSS observations. The ability to detect spoofing
   using a residuals-based RAIM algorithm in a tightly-coupled GNSS/INS
   integrated system has been previously proposed. Considering the recent
   advancements in sensor quality (mainly in MEMS grade) and the widespread
   adoptions of GNSS and INS in mass market applications, including
   automotive and pedestrian navigation, this paper analyzes the GNSS
   signal authentication performance limits available using different
   grades of IMU (tactical and MEMS) to detect errors in combination with
   different grades of GNSS receiver (navigation and automotive) for
   automotive applications.}},

Abstract = {{Civilian GNSS signals are highly vulnerable to spoofing attacks due to
   the publicly known signal structure and lack of protection against it. A
   spoofing signal which is synchronized to authentic ones can deceive the
   tracking process of a receiver and may lead to a fake position solution.
   This paper focuses on analyzing the effect of spoofing signal parameters
   on a target receiver in overlapped spoofing attack scenarios. It is
   assumed that the receiver is operating in a tracking loop and the
   spoofing tries to grab the correlation function without causing loss of
   lock. The spoofing parameters to successfully capture the tracking point
   as a function of the target receiver's PLL and DLL parameters are
   discussed. The problem of interest is to detect a spoofing attack by
   utilizing different signal quality monitoring (SQM) metrics and
   characterizing the pseudorange measurement error induced by the spoofer
   as a function of delay lock loop parameters. The statistical properties
   of the spoofing detection metrics are analyzed and proper detection
   thresholds are calculated. Some experimental results in dense multipath
   environments for vehicular applications have been performed to adjust
   the SQM metrics detection threshold and to reduce the false spoofing
   detection probability.}},

   model that makes no assumption on the noise probability density function
   and proposes an average consensus algorithm in wireless sensor networks.
   The proposed method is topology unaware, and can be applied to general
   networks. Theoretical analysis shows that it provides unbiased global

   fact that in a multipath environment the fading observed in different
   frequency bands is independent of each other. The uncorrelated nature of
   signal power fluctuations can be exploited to combine their correlator
   outputs to eventually enhance carrier phase estimation. The proposed
   method is tested on different data sets collected in static and

   carrier Doppler error reduction obtained are analyzed and compared with
   those from single frequency tracking. Results show that the number of

Abstract = {{In capillary machine type communications, random multi-access lends
   itself as a natural choice at the link layer due to the largely
   intermittent, event-driven traffic involved. A major challenge to that
   end arises, however, from the anticipated large scale of the network.
   Considering a carrier sense multiple access based random access protocol
   where infrastructural support is available in the form of a coordinator
   node, this paper presents a framework to help sustain efficient protocol
   performance when faced with temporal variation in packet traffic. The
   coordinator dynamically determines a timely contention parameter by
   means of an online algorithm based on certain analytic characterizations
   of the protocol performance, and the end-nodes get opportunistically
   notified of it. Throughput, fairness and delay-variation performance
   produced by the proposed scheme turns out to be consistently close to an
   optimal protocol in identical settings, in contrast with that of the
   binary exponential backoff based solutions.}},

Abstract = {{The effective bandwidth management in multi-service computer networks
   such as university networks has become a challenge in recent years. The
   growth of internet traffic and limitation of bandwidth resources
   persuade the information technology (IT) managers to focus on effective
   bandwidth allocation policies. One of the important issues discussed in
   this domain is how to assign the bandwidth fairly based on the priority
   levels. In this paper, focusing on the ``priority-based bandwidth
   allocation{''}, a hybrid data mining method is developed to manage the
   limited bandwidth in a university network more effectively. This method
   is composed of two main steps and uses the clustering and classification
   techniques. The main purpose is to detect, analyze and predict students'
   behavioral patterns in a university network and identify the main
   factors that affect their tendency in using internet. The proposed
   method is applied on a real data of a network university. The results
   indicate that ``degree level{''} and ``age{''} are the most important
   factors that influence students' tendency to use internet. The results
   would be also useful for prediction purposes. It helps the IT managers
   to predict a new student's tendency to use internet given his/her
   characteristics. By analyzing the results, the IT managers can make
   better decisions to optimize the allocation of bandwidth resources.}},

Volume = {{6}},

Pages = {{115252-115270}},
Abstract = {{The use of enzymes for industrial and biomedical applications is limited
   to their function at elevated temperatures. The principles of
   thermostability engineering need to be implemented for proteins with low
   thermal stability to broaden their applications. Therefore,
   understanding the thermal stability modulating factors of proteins is
   necessary for engineering their thermostability. In this review, first
   different thermostability enhancing strategies in both the sequence and
   structure levels, discovered by studying the natural proteins adapted to
   different conditions, are introduced. Next, the progress in the
   development of various computational methods to engineer thermostability
   of proteins by learning from nature and introducing several popular
   tools and algorithms for protein thermostability engineering is
   highlighted. Further discussion includes the challenges in the field of
   protein thermostability engineering such as the protein stability-
   activity trade- off. Finally, how thermostability engineering could be
   instrumental for the design of protein drugs for biomedical applications
   is demonstrated.}},

Title = {{Eco-design improvement for the diaphragm forming process}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{401-410}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes an eco-design method to suggest improvements over an
   existing diaphragm forming process (DFP). In the proposed method, a
   systematic procedure is developed to provide eco-design guidance to
   engineers, and it includes four steps. In Step 1, design functions are
   analysed through functional diagrams to provide the information of
   sub-functions and functional flows. In Step 2, the eco-design
   requirements are captured via quality functional deployment (QFD) and
   then translated to design functions via functional analysis (FA). Then,
   the design functions are prioritized according to the eco-design
   requirements in considerations. In Step 3, the prioritized design
   functions are used to generate possible design concepts through the
   morphological chart. In Step 4, the generated concepts are assessed
   based on the energy use and process time of DFP. The utility of the
   proposed method is to adapt quality tools for continual improvements in
   the context of eco-design. An existing DFP is used for this work to
   demonstrate and validate the method's applicability. The result of this
   research shows that the integration of QFD and FA can systematically
   guide the generation of new eco-design concepts for DFP with less
   dependence of design intuitions.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a novel segmentation-and-grouping framework for road map
   inference from sparsely sampled GPS traces. First, we extend
   Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise with an
   orientation constraint to partition the entire point set of the traces
   into point clusters representing the road segments. Second, we propose
   an adaptive k-means algorithm that the k value is determined by an angle
   threshold to reconstruct nearly straight line segments. Third, the line
   segments are grouped according to the ` Good Continuity' principle of
   Gestalt Law to form a ` Stroke' for recovering the road map.
   Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm is robust to noises

   advantages to infer road maps from sparsely sampled GPS traces.}},

Abstract = {{Digital photogrammetric systems combined with image processing
   techniques have been used for structural monitoring purposes for more
   than a decade. For applications requiring sub-millimetre level
   precision, the use of off-the-shelf DSLR cameras is a suitable choice,
   especially when the low cost of the involved sensors is a priority. The
   disadvantage in the use of entry level DSLRs is that there is a
   trade-off between frame rate and burst rate - a high frame rate is
   either not available or it cannot be sustained long enough. This problem
   must be overcome when monitoring a structural element undergoing a
   dynamic test, where a range of loads are cycled through multiple times a
   second. In order to estimate deflections during such a scenario, this
   paper proposes a new least-squares adjustment for sinusoidal fitting.
   The new technique is capable of processing multiple back-to-back bursts
   of data within the same adjustment, which synthetically increases the
   de-facto temporal resolution of the system. The paper describes a beam
   deformation test done in a structures laboratory. The experimental
   results were assessed in terms of both their precision and accuracy. The
   new method increased the effective sampling frequency three-fold, which
   improved the standard deviations of the estimated parameters with up to
   two orders of magnitude. A residual RMSE as low as 30 mu m was attained,
   and likewise the RMSE of the computed amplitudes between the
   photogrammetric system and the control laser transducers was as small as
   34 mu m.}},

Abstract = {{With an increased focus on renewable power generation, dynamic line
   rating is being investigated as a way to connect the new intermittent
   generation to the grid without needing to build additional
   infrastructure. The number of transmission lines available for dynamic
   line rating depends on the length of each transmission line. The St.
   Clair curve is typically used by industry to determine the length of
   transmission lines that are thermally rated. This paper will extend this
   curve by including reactive power in the calculations. This paper will
   also demonstrate the effect that changing the capacity of the line due
   to dynamic line rating has on the length of transmission line that is
   thermally rated.}},

Abstract = {{Traffic accidents negatively affect the lives of human beings. Accidents
   may result in deaths, severe injuries, and loss of income to the
   impacted families. Accident detection and prevention is a keystone in
   improving road safety. In this paper, a system for detecting vehicle
   collision and rollover is presented. The proposed system includes three
   key phases. Data acquisition where accelerometer and gyroscope,
   integrated into MPU-6050 motion sensor are used to acquire 3-axis
   acceleration forces and rotation angles respectively. The complementary
   filter is used to enable the use of the gyroscope data on the short term
   because it is very precise and not susceptible to external forces. On
   the long term, the accelerometer data is used because it does not drift.
   An algorithm for acquiring data using sensors, filtering and analyzing
   data, detecting collision and rollover is developed. Experiments are
   conducted to test the proposed system. Experiments show promising
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Multispectral data from inexpensive, yet accurate, sensors has become
   readily available within the last several years and opened many
   possibilities for contactless biometrics applications. The Kinect v2
   provides depth, RGB, and Near-Infrared (NIR) data and can be used for
   recognition of individuals using extracted hand regions in all three
   spectra. Initially, the depth data is used to extract the hand region
   for use as a mask to extract the hand region in the depth, RGB, and
   Near-Infrared (NIR) spectra. These extracted regions then have Principal
   Component Analysis (PCA) applied to them before passing through
   classification. K-Nearest-Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machines
   (SVM) are compared for classification. In testing it was found that on
   average the RGB and NIR data provided a recognition rate of
   approximately 75\%-80\% for either KNN or SVM classification and at
   different amounts of principal components for PCA.}},

Abstract = {{Requirements Engineering (RE) is a decision-centric activity which is
   highly data-intensive. The results of this process are known to have key
   impact on the results of the project. As known from the experience in
   other fields and disciplines, visualization can potentially provide more
   insights into data, information and knowledge studied. While research in
   the area of information visualization and its application to software
   engineering has rapidly increased over the last decade, there is only a
   limited amount of studies addressing the usage and impact of
   visualization techniques for RE activities. In this paper, we report on
   the results of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) related to RE
   visualization. Extending the established SLR process by the usage of
   grounded theory for the encoding of papers, we synthesize 18 usage
   patterns. Even though there are punctual applications, there is a clear
   deficit on a holistic perspective across the different RE activities. As
   another conclusion, we derive the clear need for more research on
   visualization support in particular for tackling requirements
   uncertainty, requirements verification, and modelling, as well as
   Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs).}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, polymer flooding has become a mature technology to
   improve the reservoir recovery rate and has been successfully
   implemented in many oil fields. Because of high operating costs of a
   polymer flooding project and the impact to the environment, the polymer
   injected per unit volume should be tracked for each polymer flooding
   pattern. Hence, the full-field reservoir simulations with fine-scale
   grids are needed to capture fine-scale phenomena and to optimize the
   process. To meet these objectives, a polymer module has been developed
   in our in-house parallel black oil simulator, which allows parallel
   simulations using clusters and supercomputers. With our parallel
   simulator, the elapsed time of full-field simulations with millions of
   grid blocks can be reduced from days to hours or minutes, and even for a
   much larger model with hundreds of millions of grid blocks, the
   simulations can be finished in practical time. In order to guarantee the
   computational efficiency and the parallel scalability, an inexact Newton
   method is applied and a new CPR (Constrained Pressure Residual)-type
   preconditioner is designed. In this paper, a SPE10-based polymer
   flooding case is tested, the performance of nonlinear and linear solvers
   are robust, and an encouraging parallel scalability is obtained. The
   second case is a full-field polymer flooding case, for which a coarse
   grid model and a fine grid model are both used. The results show the
   differences of the oil production rate and the water cut, which
   illustrates the accuracy of fine-grid simulations. For the fine grid
   model, up to 1024 CPU cores are employed, and an excellent speedup is
   achieved.}},

Abstract = {{A geomechanical model and a multiphase black oil model are iteratively
   coupled in this paper. Parallel computing is employed to handle large
   scale problems by benefiting from its features of distributed memory
   storage and efficient runtime reduction. The finite element method and
   the finite difference method are employed to discretize the two models,
   respectively. The geomechanical model is developed with the capability
   of simulating the rock matrix deformation with complex constitutive laws
   and its effects on reservoir properties. The multiphase flow model is
   modified by introducing geomechanical variables in a conventional flow
   model. A coupling strategy is carefully proposed to enable tight and
   dynamic interactions between these two models, as well as improving
   parallel computational efficiency. Example problems are presented to
   demonstrate the utility and efficiency of the coupled models. Expected
   geomechanical phenomena are illustrated by numerical experiments and
   validated by commercial software. In addition, for testing the
   scalability behaviour, field scale problems with millions reservoir and
   geomechanical grid blocks are performed. The results show encouraging
   speedups which indicate the integrated models can be an efficient and
   useful tool for evaluating and analyzing oil and gas production of
   stress-sensitive reservoirs.}},

Abstract = {{Design approaches for radio frequency (RF) analog realization of
   two-dimensional (2-D) network-resonant plane-wave filters are discussed.
   The plane-wave filters having potential applications in electronically
   scanned wideband beamforming scenarios operate in spatially-discrete
   temporally-continuous 2-D mixed-domain as described by their recursive
   input-output relationships. The proposed approaches imply analog array
   processing architectures consisting of identical interconnected analog
   modules (AMs). A 65 nm CMOS circuit simulation of a single AM operating
   at 700 MHz is used to verify the 2-D plane-wave filter response and
   array pattern in the first approach. An all-pass filter based time delay
   approximation is used to design the AMs in the second approach, where a
   prototype CMOS all-pass filter operating at 5. 6 GHz is simulated to
   verify the 2-D plan-wave filter frequency response and array pattern in
   closed-form.}},

   in this paper are represented in a mantissa/exponent format produced by
   an innovative WDR imager which takes advantage of a multi-reset
   technique during the capture process. The algorithm has been implemented
   on FPGA and designed to be very small, fast, power-efficient and has the
   potential to be directly integrated into the same chip as the imager.

Abstract = {{Vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) present as partial collapses of

   to classify VCFs using TI-weighted magnetic resonance images (AM of the
   lumbar spine acquired in the sagittal plane. Our study group comprised
   63 patients (38 women and 25 men). From these patients 102 lumbar VCFs
   (53 benign and 49 malignant) and 89 normal vertebral bodies were
   manually segmented The principal axis of each vertebral body region of
   interest was identified using moments. Statistical features of height
   and width measured perpendicular and parallel to the principal axis were
   computed The k-nearest-neighbor method, a neural network with radial
   basis functions, and the naive Bayes classifier were used with feature
   selection for classification. Areas under the receiver operating
   characteristic curve of 0.96 in the recognition of VCFs as compared with
   normal vertebral bodies and 0.73 for the classification of benign versus
   malignant VCFs were obtained The proposed methods are promising for the

   entire mainstream communication frequency band 1.65-2.75GHz. Using a
   20MHz, 7.5dB PAPR LTE signal, the fabricated DPA is measured and

   46\%-62\% modulated efficiency over the designed 1.1GHz frequency range

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new modified envelope delta-sigma (DS) based
   transmitter architecture with good linearity and efficiency performance
   without applying any linearization techniques. For the proposed
   transmitter setup, a pulsed load modulation (PLM) amplifier is
   implemented and used for its high power efficiency at the back-off power
   levels. For high efficiency performance of the PA and maintaining the
   linearity of the system, an envelope DS modulator is utilized to
   quantized standard signals prior to the PA. Simulation results also show
   that higher coding efficiency of the quantized signal is achievable
   employing the envelope DS modulator instead of its Cartesian DS
   modulator counterpart. To validate the proposed technique, a transmitter
   prototype is implemented and tested with standard signals with various
   pick-to-average power ratios (PAPRs). Using this transmitter setup for a
   3MHz bandwidth LTE signal with 7dB PAPR and a WiMAX signal with 1.25MHz
   bandwidth and 7.9dB PAPR, the average drain efficiency of about 45\% and

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel multi-stage digital predistortion (DPD) with
   constrained feedback bandwidth is proposed. The proposed DPD effectively
   compensates for the nonlinear distortion in closely spaced multi-carrier
   power amplifiers (PAs). By extracting the PA static nonlinearity
   characteristics from the bandwidth-constrained signals and separately
   processing the multi-carriers input, the proposed DPD reduces the
   feedback bandwidth, which results in a reduction of the sampling rate.
   Moreover, while the DPD reduces the spectral regrowth in the adjacent
   channels, it effectively suppresses the spectral regrowth within the
   off-carrier regions along the transmission bandwidth. Experimental
   results have validated improved performance on a 60 MHz LTE-advanced
   signal, even when the analog to digital converter sampling rate is
   constrained to 61.44 Msps. Thus, the proposed technique can
   significantly decrease the difficulties in system design and reduce
   implementation cost.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a mathematical model, along with simulation and
   experimental validation for the optimal fundamental load modulation
   design space for harmonically tuned switch mode power amplifiers.
   Starting from conventional class-F-1 PA with a conventional optimal load
   modulation on the real impedances axis, it is shown mathematically that
   by moving one of the harmonic terminations along the edge of the smith
   chart (purely reactive impedance), the optimum fundamental load
   trajectory is moved away from the conventional real impedances axis to a
   complex impedance trajectory that maintains constant high power
   efficiency for different output power back-off values. A 10 W GaN
   transistor is measured in a harmonic load pull system at 2.14 GHz in
   order to validate the theory.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores control of a four rotor aerial vehicle, or
   quadrotor. The quadrotor exhibits underdamped and under-actuated
   dynamics, so designing a feedback control that can provide robustness to
   disturbances such as wind and adapt to payloads provides a research
   challenge. The Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC) is a type
   of neural network that can provide the basis for a stable adaptive
   neurocontrol. However, traditional robust weight update schemes for the
   CMAC must often sacrifice performance to eliminate bursting caused by
   weight drift. This work applies an introspective voting weight update
   scheme to a CMAC to avoid busting, without reducing performance. The
   proposed scheme achieves stable, adaptive, and robust control in both
   simulation and experiment.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, the ubiquity of mobile devices (such as smartphones and
   tablets) has encouraged the development of context-aware and
   personalized computation to filter the query results and provide
   recommendations based on different situations of a user. On the other
   hand, global positioning system (GPS) technology along with
   microelectromechanical system (MEMS) sensors enables location sensing on
   mobile devices. Context-aware computation can provide customized
   services in different contexts - where context is related to the user's
   location, activity and historical information. Our main focus in this
   paper, the Context-aware Recommendation System (Co-ARS), is one of the
   major applications that has been refined over the years due to the
   evolving geospatial technologies and data mining. The proposed Co-ARS
   application achieves the list of recommendations by utilizing the user's
   context information (such as location and preferred transportation
   mode), item's context information ( such as restaurant ratings and
   types), and personalized preference information (based on individuals
   past behavior). In this paper, we have described the application of such
   a system in the City of Calgary using android smartphones. The
   implemented system used various data filtering and management techniques
   to provide beneficial and accurate recommendation results to the users.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we tested the performance and scalability on three
   supercomputers of different architectures including SDSC's Comet,
   SciNet's GPC and IBM's Blue Gene/Q systems, through benchmarking
   parallel reservoir simulations. The Comet and GPC systems adopt a
   fat-tree network and they are connected with InfiniBand interconnects
   technology. The Blue Gene/Q uses a 5-dimensional toroidal network and it
   is connected with custom interconnects. In terms of supercomputer
   architectures, these systems represent two main interconnect families:
   fat-tree and torus. To demonstrate the application scalability for
   supercomputers with today's diversified architectures, we benchmark a
   parallel black oil simulator that is extensively used in the petroleum
   industry. Our implementation for this simulator is coded in C and MPI,
   and it offers grids, data, linear solvers, preconditioners, distributed
   matrices and vectors and modeling modules. Load balancing is based on
   the Hilbert space-filling curve (HSFC) method. Krylov subspace and AMG
   solvers are implemented, including restarted GMRES, BiCGSTAB, and AMG
   solvers from Hypre. The results show that the Comet is the fastest
   supercomputer among tested systems and the Blue Gene/Q has the best
   parallel efficiency. The scalability analysis helps to identify the
   performance barriers for different supercomputer architectures. The
   study of testing the application performance serves to provide the
   insights for carrying out parallel reservoir simulations on large-scale
   computers of different architectures.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-user efficacy is a key factor of genuine collaboration among
   multiple users towards a common goal. To assess multi-user efficacy,
   social scientists have traditionally applied subjective measurements
   from a theoretical perspective. Researchers in human-computer
   interaction have developed combined metrics of objective and subjective
   measurements. Nevertheless, the combined metrics fall short to fully
   cover the theoretical perspective of social scientists. To remedy this
   shortfall, we have developed a set of objective and subjective metrics
   to complete the theoretical perspective. Utilizing the metrics, we
   present in this paper a study to verify the robustness of our dynamic
   priority (DP) model, which under a quasi-practical scenario resolves
   command conflicts and promotes perceived equality in interaction among
   multiple users. In the study, we utilized a realistic scenario which
   differs from the quasi-practical scenario in the allowance of verbal
   communication among users. The results of the study revealed that the DP
   model yielded a significantly higher degree of multi-user efficacy under
   the realistic scenario than the quasi-practical scenario. Moreover,
   there was no significant difference of the perceived equality in
   interaction between both scenarios. These observations confirm the
   robustness of the DP model, and imply the potential application of the
   model for genuine collaboration within multiuser VEs.}},

Abstract = {{We study a supply chain network equilibrium model for perishable
   products under the theory of discrete choice models, which comprises
   multiple perishable product manufacturers, distributors and retailers.
   Our goal is to present equilibrium outputs for different firms in this
   supply chain network model for perishable products based on retailers'
   utility maximization. The network model is built upon transportation
   time function and deterioration rate to express the characteristics of
   perishable products, with the inclusion of the discarding costs
   associated with temperature control in transportation. Discrete choice
   model was used to elaborate retailers' choice according to their utility
   maximization. Furthermore, the variational inequality formulation is
   used to express the equilibrium solution of supply chain network for
   perishable products, which determines their profit shares in
   competition. A numerical example is present to support this model is
   reliable and reasonable.}},

Abstract = {{Over the years, studies presented on shock wave model optimization have
   been limited to the proposal of optimization control policies using
   queue length constraints in oversaturated conditions, and also finding
   the optimum cycle time and green splits based on either a known cycle
   time from the field or an optimum cycle time obtained from other
   methods. To our best knowledge, we can say after reviewing the
   literature that no attempt has been made to use the shock wave model to
   find the optimum cycle time for a general isolated intersection, because
   minimizing this model generates very small values, close to zero for an
   optimum cycle time, which is unacceptable.
   In this paper, we propose an optimization model that provides the
   optimum cycle time and green splits when the total average delay at a
   general isolated signalized intersection is minimized for all vehicles
   present. To do so, we model the lost time effect in the shock wave delay
   model, which creates the most desirable optimum cycle time values. In
   our optimization process, the key strategy is to keep both approaches in
   the undersaturated condition. Therefore, our model works when the total
   amount of volume-to-capacity ratio of both approaches is less than 2.0;
   otherwise, where both approaches are oversaturated, other control
   policies should be considered and utilized. A comparison of the results
   with a widely-used formula in the literature reveals that our model is
   superior.}},

   hybrid base station (BS) location model which considers the location
   regularity of macro BSs and topological randomness of small BSs, where

   verified by simulation. When both tiers have the same BS intensity, the
   tier of tessellated macro BSs achieves a 50\% advantage in spectral
   efficiency and the tier of underlaid randomly positioned small BSs
   exhibits a 30\% improvement, over that of a 2-tier pure random model
   where both tiers are modeled by Poisson point processes. With the
   increasing small BSs to macro BS intensity, the spectral efficiency gain
   of the hybrid model over that of the pure random model decreases and
   even becomes marginal, thus providing a design guideline on the small
   BSs to macro BS intensity ratio to achieve a desired coverage

Pages = {{1-8}},
Abstract = {{A disaggregate behavioral tour-based microsimulation model was developed
   to forecast intrastate long-distance personal travel on a typical
   weekday as part of an overall statewide travel model system for all
   residents of California. A novel approach to what is traditionally
   described as travel generation was developed as a series of choice
   models focusing on consistency and integration with other components of
   the model system. Key features include the explicit integration of this
   long-distance personal travel model with the complementary
   short-distance personal travel model, the specification of a travel
   party size model for long-distance travel based on household size, and
   the development of models to represent characteristics of the
   long-distance travel tour, including duration of tour (number of
   nights), travel day status for a typical weekday, and time of travel
   within the weekday. The explicit trade-off between long- and
   short-distance travel produces appropriate sensitivities and reproduces
   the real-world phenomenon of rural travelers producing more
   long-distance travel. Subsequent models not described in detail in this
   paper take advantage of this information; in particular, party size has
   a significant effect on mode choice. The model system is operational and
   has been calibrated and validated.}},

Abstract = {{A new approach is introduced in this research to identify the optimal
   designs of adaptable products that can be changed, such as reconfigured
   and upgraded, in the operation stage considering the whole product
   life-cycle spans based on the modular design and optimization methods.
   In this new approach, product descriptions in different life-cycle
   phases are modeled by different configurations, and each of these
   configurations is described by a set of parameters. Components with
   similar life-cycle properties are grouped into modules. A hybrid AND-OR
   tree is used to model all feasible design candidates, different
   configurations in different life-cycle phases for each feasible design
   candidate, and parameters for each configuration. A multi-level
   optimization method is employed to identify the best design solution,
   its configurations in different life-cycle phases, and parameter values
   of the relevant configurations based on evaluation considering the whole
   product life-cycle span. A case study is implemented to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the developed new adaptable design approach. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The research towards improving the prediction and forecasting of
   artificial neural network (ANN) based models has gained significant
   interest while solving various engineering problems. Consequently,
   different approaches for the development of ANN models have been
   proposed. However, the point estimation of ANN forecasts seldom explains
   the actual mechanism that brings the relationship among modeled
   variables. This raises the question on the model output while making
   decisions due to the inherent variability or uncertainty associated. The
   standard procedure though available for the quantification of
   uncertainty, their applications in ANN model are still limited. In this
   chapter, commonly employed uncertainty methods such as bootstrap and
   Bayesian are applied in ANN and demonstrated through a case example of
   flood forecasting models. It also discusses the merits and limitations
   of bootstrap ANN (BTANN) and Bayesian ANN (BANN) models in terms of
   convergence of parameter and quality of prediction interval evaluated
   using uncertainty indices.}},

Abstract = {{The paper deals with a closed-form continuum description of coupled
   fluid flow-deformation behavior of porous media with distributed strong
   discontinuities. Based on the underlying physics of the solid and fluid
   phases at the microscale, the macroscopic hydro-mechanical (HM) behavior
   of a representative elementary volume is eventually retrieved in the
   fully saturated case using the mean-field theory and Mori-Tanaka
   Homogenization Scheme. The heterogeneity that governs the overall HM
   behavior is induced by evolving microcracks described by a crack density
   distribution tensor. Herein, only the shape and orientation of
   microcracks are accounted for in the upscaling process. Examples are
   presented to assess the robustness of the proposed mathematical
   formulation. Finally, the evolution of heterogeneity in poromechanical
   parameters as well as hydraulic properties of the system is investigated
   by coupling a microcrack growth formulation under general loading
   conditions with fluid flow. We will briefly discuss, through material
   point simulations, how the proposed model can capture localized
   deformations and corresponding fluid transmission behavior starting from
   an initially homogeneous state.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic Thermal Line Rating (DTLR) provides actual current-carrying
   capacity of transmission lines by considering weather conditions
   perceived to be influential on line thermal capacity. These weather
   variables include ambient temperature, wind speed, and wind direction.
   In this paper, a probability technique is adopted to effectively model
   the existing uncertainties in weather variables. A probability
   distribution is assigned to each variable to account for the inherent
   uncertainties in weather data. Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) technique is
   then employed to generate different scenarios for relevant weather data.
   Output of MCS is fed to the IEEE model to obtain the probability
   distribution of sectional line ampacity estimated at each line span.
   Next, probability distribution of line ampacity will be calculated as
   the minimum of the ampacities estimated at each line span. Expected
   value and related percentiles of line ampacity can be derived from its
   probability distribution. The proposed approach would enable system
   operators to make decisions on DTLR accounting for risk and degree of
   uncertainty that power utilities are willing to accept.}},

Abstract = {{Sensitivity analysis is an important tool in building energy assessment
   to determine the key factors influencing energy use or carbon emissions
   for buildings. This research is focused on comparing the characteristics
   of four global sensitivity analysis: SRC (standardized regression
   coefficient), Morris design, extended FAST (Fourier Amplitude
   Sensitivity Test) and TGP (treed Gaussian process) method. A retail
   building located at Harbin (China) is used as a case study to
   demonstrate the advantages and drawbacks for these four methods. The
   results indicate that the TGP method (one of meta-modelling approaches)
   is the best choice in terms of both accuracy and computationally cost.
   Note that the TGP method needs more time to calculate the sensitivity
   index although it needs only moderate time for running building energy
   models. At least two fundamentally different methods for sensitivity
   analysis are recommended to be performed to provide more robust results

Abstract = {{Traditionally, solving the parameter identification inverse problems of
   partial differential equations encountered many difficulties and
   insufficiency. In this paper, we propose an improved GEP (Gene
   Expression Programming) to identify the parameters in the reverse
   problems of partial differential equations based on the self-adaption,
   self-organization and self-learning characters of GEP. This algorithm
   simulates a parametric function itself of a partial differential
   equation directly through the observed values by fully taking into
   account inverse results caused by noises of a measured value. Modeling
   is unnecessary to add regularization in the modeling process aiming at
   special problems again. The experiment results show that the algorithm
   has good noise-immunity. In case there is no noise or noise is very low,
   the identified parametric function is almost the same as the original
   accurate value; when noise is very high, good results can still be
   obtained, which successfully realizes automation of the parameter
   modeling process for partial differential equations.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate and reliable vehicle localization is a key component of
   Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) applications. Personalized
   travel related services and recommendation systems like collision
   avoidance rely principally on the accurate and reliable knowledge of
   vehicles' positioning. In this paper we propose a cooperative
   multi-sensor multi-vehicle localization method with high accuracy for
   terrestrial consumer vehicles. Two streams of real-time data are assumed
   available. One in the form of GPS coordinates of nearby vehicles
   received from a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) network and the other in the
   form of inter-vehicle distance measurements from a range sensor. In
   real-world situations, these heterogeneous sources of information are
   noisy and could be unavailable during short intervals. To overcome the
   effect of noise, measurements from two sources are fused together to
   estimate the number and motion model parameters of the vehicles. The
   problem is formulated in the context of Bayesian framework and vehicle
   locations as well as their velocities are estimated via a
   SequentialMonte-Carlo Probability Hypothesis Density (SMC-PHD) filter.
   To test the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a simulated scenario
   based on a grid portion of downtown Calgary is designed. Traffic
   intensity values match real-world reported data for the selected test
   location. Results of the simulation indicate that the proposed method
   provides reliable estimation of motion model parameters that predict the
   future location of vehicles.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, multi-layered Halloysite polyelectrolyte nanocontainers,
   which will be used to store corrosion inhibitors to develop smart
   coating technology, were fabricated, and doped in a home-modified epoxy
   coating. The Halloysite nanocontainers were characterised, and their
   compatibility with the epoxy coating was tested in terms of the
   anti-corrosion performance for X65 pipeline steel. Results demonstrate
   that the fabricated Halloysite nanocontainers have a more uniform scale
   and better dispersion than the as-received Halloysite particles. The
   processing introduces new functional groups in the material, but does
   not change its intrinsic structure. The epoxy coating containing
   Halloysite nanocontainers possesses enhanced corrosion resistance.
   Moreover, with the increase in the content of the Halloysite
   nanocontainers in the coating, the corrosion resistance is further
   improved. The prepared Halloysite nanocontainers are highly compatible
   with the epoxy coating for corrosion resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Nd: YLF laser beam machining (LBM) process has a great potential to
   manufacture intricate shaped microproducts with its unique
   characteristics. Continuous improvement (CI) effort for LBM process is
   usually realised by response surface methodology, which is an important
   tool in Design of Six Sigma. However, when determining the optimal
   machining parameters in CI for LBM process, model parameter uncertainty
   is typically neglected. Performing worst case analysis in CI, this paper
   presents a new loss function method that takes model parameter
   uncertainty into account via Bayesian credible region. Unlike existing
   CI methods in LBM process, the proposed Bayesian probabilistic approach
   is based on seemingly unrelated regression which can produce more
   precise estimations of the model parameters than ordinary least squares
   in correlated multiple responses problems. An Nd: YLF laser beam
   micro-drilling process is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed approach. The comparison results show that micro-holes produced
   by the proposed approach have better quality than those of existing
   approaches in terms of robustness and process capability.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-modal chemical sensors based on microelectromechanical systems
   (MEMS) have been developed with an electrical readout. Opto-calorimetric
   infrared (IR) spectroscopy, capable of obtaining molecular signatures of
   extremely small quantities of adsorbed explosive molecules, has been
   realized with a microthermometer/microheater device using a widely
   tunable quantum cascade laser. A microthermometer/microheater device
   responds to the heat generated by non-radiative decay process when the
   adsorbed explosive molecules are resonantly excited with IR light.
   Monitoring the variation in microthermometer signal as a function of
   illuminating IR wavelength corresponds to the conventional IR absorption
   spectrum of the adsorbed molecules. Moreover, the mass of the adsorbed
   molecules is determined by measuring the resonance frequency shift of
   the cantilever shape microthermometer for the quantitative
   opto-calorimetric IR spectroscopy. In addition, micro-differential
   thermal analysis, which can be used to differentiate exothermic or
   endothermic reaction of heated molecules, has been performed with the
   same device to provide additional orthogonal signal for trace explosive
   detection and sensor surface regeneration. In summary, we have designed,
   fabricated and tested microcantilever shape devices integrated with a
   microthermometer/microheater which can provide electrical responses used
   to acquire both opto-calorimetric IR spectra and microcalorimetric
   thermal responses. We have demonstrated the successful detection,
   differentiation, and quantification of trace amounts of explosive
   molecules and their mixtures (cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX) and
   pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN)) using three orthogonal sensing
   signals which improve chemical selectivity.}},

   modified to computing the isotherm of capillary condensation. Then it is
   coupled with the multispace adsorption model and Peng-Robinson equation
   of state to investigate and represent the phase behavior of hydrocarbons
   in organic nanopores. Then, a prediction process for the behavior of a
   four-component mixture of methane, n-butane, n-pentane, n-hexane are

Abstract = {{The wake behind an infinite span (2D) thin flat plate normal to uniform
   flow was examined using Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) at Re =
   U(0)h/nu = 1200 and 2400. Three distinct flow regimes were identified in
   the wake due to the interruption of regular anti-symmetric Karman
   shedding. Disruption of the regular shedding (Regime M) was followed by
   a period of delayed roll-up (Regime L) and a longer duration of high
   intensity shedding (Regime H) before regular shedding resumes again.
   Size of the wake mean recirculation region changed with progression of
   the wake patters from a long-term mean length of 2.90-3.60h (L) and then
   2.16h (H). Moreover, the wake turbulence characteristics were effected
   with the wake evolution. These effects were quantified by variations in
   the turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) magnitude, production, dissipation
   and diffusion. Spanwise instabilities were responsible for appearance of
   the three flow regimes. A projection of these instabilities was observed
   in the pressure field behind the plate.}},

Abstract = {{Controlling stem cell (SC) fate is an extremely important topic in the
   realm of SC research. A variety of different external cues mainly
   mechanical, chemical, or electrical stimulations individually or in
   combination have been incorporated to control SC fate. Here, we will
   deconstruct the probable relationship between the functioning of
   electromagnetic (EMF) and SC fate of a variety of different SCs. The
   electromagnetic (EM) nature of the cells is discussed with the emphasis
   on the effects of EMF on the determinant factors that directly and/or
   indirectly influence cell fate. Based on the EM effects on a variety of
   cellular processes, it is believed that EMFs can be engineered to
   provide a controlled signal with the highest impact on the SC fate
   decision. Considering the novelty and broad applications of applying
   EMFs to change SC fate, it is necessary to shed light on many unclear
   mechanisms underlying this phenomenon.}},

Title = {{A multi-skeleton modelling approach based on top-down design and modular
   product design for development of complex product layouts}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{725-750}},
Abstract = {{Top-down design (TDD) and modular product design (MPD) are two popular
   design strategies for development of complex products. Although
   integration of these two design strategies can improve the quality and
   efficiency for the development of complex products, it is difficult to
   implement the TDD and MPD strategies simultaneously due to the lack of
   tools that can handle modelling of the inheritance mechanism from the
   abstract design descriptions to the detailed design descriptions within
   TDD and modelling of the relatively independent design descriptions as
   groups within MPD. A new multi-skeleton modelling approach is introduced
   in this research for layout design of complex products based on TDD and
   MPD. First, through studies on the inheritance mechanism between design
   descriptions on different levels in the hierarchical product modelling
   architecture and the interface relationships between different modules,
   design information is classified into five categories: locations,
   interface features, design spaces, key features and kinematic
   constraints. Second, these different types of design information are
   modelled using three types of skeletons: location skeletons, interface
   skeletons and published skeletons. Third, a multi-skeleton modelling
   scheme is introduced for the development of product descriptions from
   relative abstract levels to more detailed levels recursively in TDD
   manner with relatively independent modules. This multi-skeleton
   modelling approach can be used to propagate changes of product
   descriptions on different levels, to improve design efficiency by
   reusing and modifying the existing modules, and to evaluate the design
   at early design stage without detailed design descriptions. In addition,
   the multi-skeleton model can be implemented in most CAD systems. A case
   study is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the new multi-skeleton
   modelling approach.}},

Title = {{Varying-scale shale gas flow: Discrete fracture networks (DFN) based
   numerical simulation}},
Journal = {{PARTICULATE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{557-564}},
Abstract = {{The development of unconventional gas reservoirs represents totally
   distinctive characteristics as compared with its conventional
   counterparts. The prevailing commercial strategy of stimulating
   fractures to connect the matrix to wellbores results in an even more
   complicated shale gas flow behavior, in which matrix flow is fairly
   coupled with fracture flow. Numerous works have been contributed to
   unveil the underground shale gas production mechanisms. And some
   impressive progresses have been made in describing the complex
   subterranean shale gas flow, such as the introduction of discrete
   fracture network (DFN) from National Energy Technology Laboratory
   (NETL). However, none of them captures the varying-scale nature of the
   in-place gas flow in shale sediments. In this work, we try to fill this
   gap. Following the concept of DFN, we set up mathematical models for
   shale gas flow in matrix and fracture networks, and also for their mass
   transfer in between without neglecting its varying-scale nature. In
   addition, we also investigate comprehensively the impact of various
   effects and phenomena occurred in pore spaces during production course,
   such as adsorption and desorption on rock surfaces, gas slippage and
   Knudsen diffusion, and diffusion in bulk kerogen, on the overall shale
   gas production using our new model for a specific shale gas reservoir
   case study.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2540}},
Pages = {{56-65}},
Abstract = {{Shanghai, China, has the largest metro system in the world, with a
   network length of more than 550 km. Both Shanghai and Beijing are among
   the top five cities in terms of ridership, and some of the most
   important components of their metro systems are the ring transit lines.
   Many other cities, in China and elsewhere, also envision a ring transit
   line for their future rail transit networks. A previously developed
   analytical model for the long-range planning of ring transit lines was
   used in the comparison of the current alignment of the Shanghai ring
   line with the optimized model output, and a second ring transit line was
   recommended for the future Shanghai network. The findings suggest that
   the alignment of an existing ring line would affect the optimal
   alignment of the second ring line. In addition, if an outer ring line
   exists (or is planned to be constructed), the optimal location of the
   inner ring line might not be its current location. Furthermore, a
   sensitivity analysis was conducted to test the impact of changes on
   demand, value of time, and passenger ride cost on the second ring line.
   Zones that would benefit most from introduction of the second ring line
   were also determined. Although the case study presents the Shanghai ring
   lines, the outcomes provide useful information for other cities that are
   considering the expansion of their transit network with a first or
   second ring line. Unlike simulations and agent-based models, the model
   presented in this study is easily transferable to any transit network.}},

Journal = {{BIORHEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{49-67}},
Abstract = {{The rheological properties of synovial fluid (SF) are largely attributed
   to the presence of high molecular weight hyaluronan (HA). However,
   rheological differences between SF and pure HA solutions suggest that SF
   proteins actively contribute towards the bulk viscoelasticity of this
   biological fluid. Due to various experimental challenges involved with
   the rheometry of low-viscosity biological fluids, the macromolecular
   interactions in SF and their relative rheological importance are still a
   matter of active discussion. Interestingly however, recent evidence
   suggests that the concentration and structure of proteoglycan 4 (PRG4,
   also known as lubricin) can directly modulate the viscoelastic
   properties of HA-PRG4 solutions. The objective of this review is to
   highlight recent rheological studies that examine the macromolecular
   interactions between HA and proteins in SF. First, a general overview of
   the chemical composition of SF and the molecular structure of its key
   constituents HA and PRG4 is provided. Subsequently, diverse rheological
   experimental techniques that have been developed to characterize HA
   solutions are discussed. Finally, rheological investigations of
   macromolecular interactions between HA, serum proteins, and PRG4 are
   examined. This review illustrates how diverse rheological techniques can
   expand our understanding of the composition-structure-function

Abstract = {{An energy management system (EMS) for efficient and tractable
   coordination of distributed energy sources in a residential level
   microgrid is presented. Sources of energy include renewable (solar
   photovoltaic and wind turbine), conventional systems (microturbine and
   utility grid connection) and battery energy storage system. The overall
   problem I. is formulated using parametric mixed integer linear
   programming (p-MILP) via parameterization of the uncertain coordinates
   of the wind and solar resources. This results in a bi-level optimization
   problem, where choice of the parameterization scheme is made at the
   upper level while system operation decisions are made at the lower
   level. The p-MILP formulation leads to significant improvements in
   uncertainty management, solution quality and computational burden; by
   easing dependency on meteorological information and avoiding the
   multiple computational cycles of the traditional online optimization
   techniques. The problem is solved offline on a day-ahead basis, allowing
   online implementation to be achieved via real-time system state updates.
   The proposed parametric programming approach extends the
   state-of-the-art in microgrid energy management methods, and the
   simulation evidence its feasibility and effectiveness. (C) 2016, IFAC

   P4501A1 (CYP1A), aromatase B (Aro B) and heat shock proteins (HSP-70)
   transcript levels. The mRNA levels of CYP1A gene increased about two
   fold while exposure of zebrafish embryos at 72hpf resulted in
   significant induction (P = 0.048) of Aro B at 100 mu g/L of BPA.
   Exposure of zebrafish embryos at 72hpf to increasing concentrations of
   BPA resulted in significant induction (P = 0.0031) of HSP-70 transcript
   level. UV treatment of BPA resulted in a significant reduction in
   toxicity by reducing mortality of zebrafish embryos. The results suggest
   that UV-C direct photolysis may be an effective method for remediation

Abstract = {{One of the biggest challenges that consumers and service providers have
   is connecting a wide range of consumer electronics in a smart home
   environment. Resource planning and bandwidth allocation for these
   networks in the license free Industrial Scientific Medical (ISM)
   frequency band can not be guaranteed. In this paper, we propose
   improvements for ZigBee physical layer in order to cope with coexistence
   issue. A detailed MATLAB/Simulink simulator is developed to achieve our
   objective. In order to balance the trade-off between multipath effects
   and receiver complexity, the spreading gain of the conventional Direct
   Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) scheme is limited to 9dB. Unfortunately,
   this reduces the interference suppression capability of spread spectrum
   schemes. Here, we propose a low complex spread spectrum scheme for the
   ZigBee physical layer. The proposed scheme is shown to be robust against
   multipath fading and interference with a low complexity.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-dimensional noise-shaping method based on delta-sigma modulation
   has been proposed. This method extends delta-sigma modulation into the
   two-dimensional (2-D) case (space, time). The proposed noise-shaping
   method employs lossless discrete integrators for realization in
   microwave and mm-wave array processing systems. The paper shows that 2-D
   noiseshaping reduces the spectral overlap of a desired array signal with
   that of noise. By reducing the overlap of the ROSs, 2D filtering can be
   used to improve the overall noise figure of the array receiver. A noise
   figure improvement of 2.6 dB could be simulated for a 4-times spatially
   over-sampled array with 65 simulated elements for an input signal to
   noise ratio of 10 dB and LNA noise figure of 5 dB. Simulation results
   based on wide-band signals on 33, 65, 129 and 257 element antenna arrays
   with 2, 4 and 8 times oversampling show the potential capability of the
   proposed system in improving overall noise figure. Although mathematical
   modeling shows potential improvements in receiver noise figure, RF
   integrated circuit realizations are challenging and have not been
   attempted yet.}},

Abstract = {{RF antenna array beamforming based on electronically steerable wideband
   phased-array apertures find applications in communications, radar,
   imaging and microwave sensing. High-bandwidth requirements for wideband
   RF applications necessitate hundreds of MHz or GHz frame-rates for the
   digital array processor. A systolic architecture is proposed for the
   real-time implementation of the 2-D IIR beam filter. This implementation
   employs a differential-form polyphase 2-D IIR frequency-planar beam
   filter, and a corresponding circuit architecture in order to achieve the
   real-time computation of the input-output 2-D difference equation that
   defines the RF beam filter. The feasibility of real-time implementation
   for dense aperture arrays operating in the 0-240 MHz band using a beam
   filter is explored. The proposed 2-phase sampling scheme per antenna is
   based on a 2-D IIR polyphase structure. A digital hardware prototype is
   designed, implemented and tested using a ROACH-2 fitted with a Xilinx
   Virtex-6 Sx475t FPGA chip and a 32-channel time-interleaved RF data

Abstract = {{Acustom knee loading apparatus (KLA), when used in conjunction with
   magnetic resonance imaging, enables in vivo measurement of the gross
   anterior laxity of the knee joint. A numerical model was applied to the
   KLA to understand the contribution of the individual joint structures
   and to estimate the stiffness of the anterior-cruciate ligament (ACL).
   The model was evaluated with a cadaveric study using an in situ knee
   loading apparatus and an ElectroForce test system. A constrained
   optimization solution technique was able to predict the restraining
   forces within the soft-tissue structures and joint contact. The
   numerical model presented here allowed in vivo prediction of thematerial
   stiffness parameters of the ACL in response to applied anterior loading.
   Promising results were obtained for in vivo load sharing within the
   structures. The numerical model overestimated the ACL forces by
   27.61-92.71\%. This study presents a novel approach to estimate ligament
   stiffness and provides the basis to develop a robust and accurate
   measure of in vivo knee joint laxity.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a supply chain system is viewed as a maintainable system,
   and the economic-statistical design of a likelihood ratio control chart
   with a maintenance application is considered for this system. The supply
   chain system is described by a three-state: normal state, warning state
   and failure state. A likelihood ratio control chart is used to monitor
   the system given that only categorical observations can be obtained.
   When the chart signals, a full inspection is performed to determine the
   actual system state (normal or warning), and preventive maintenance is
   immediately performed in the warning state. In addition, the supply
   chain system must be corrected upon failure (i.e. corrective
   maintenance), and should be maintained in a scheduled time (i.e. planned
   maintenance). A mathematical model is developed for the joint
   optimisation of the control chart parameters and planned maintenance
   time based on renewal theory. An example is presented to illustrate how
   to determine the optimal design parameters. We also investigate the
   effect of coefficients and statistical constraints on the decision
   variables and the expected cost.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the survey accuracy of a hand-held, GNSS-free mobile
   LiDAR device, the Zebedee, is studied by collecting measurements of
   several different geometric features in four different datasets. We use
   a new comprehensive accuracy assessment methodology based on geometric
   modelling which involves a geometric model of a prism/pyramid for square
   structure. The point cloud accuracies of the features (planes,
   cylinders, catenaries, prisms and pyramids) were compared to that of a
   conventional survey-grade LiDAR system, the Leica ScanStation C10. The
   results suggested that the Zebedee accuracy is very comparable to the
   C10. For instance, the mean RMS error of plane fittings for the Zebedee
   is approximately 1.1 cm versus 0.6 cm for the C10. The estimated
   cylinder radii between the Zebedee and the C10 has only 1.4\% difference
   in average, while the radii difference in prism/pyramid fitting is only
   0.8\%. As a result, the Zebedee LiDAR device is suitable for heritage
   mapping not only because it has high operation flexibility but also
   desired high accuracy.}},

Title = {{Effects of resin I on the catalytic oxidation of n-C-7 asphaltenes in
   the presence of silica-based nanoparticles}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{78}},
Pages = {{74630-74642}},
Abstract = {{This study aims to evaluate the effects of resin I on the n-C-7
   asphaltene thermal decomposition under an oxidative atmosphere in the
   presence of hybrid nanoparticles (SNi1Pd1) of NiO and PdO supported over
   fumed silica nanoparticles. Resin I and n-C-7 asphaltenes were
   characterized by elemental analyses, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
   and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The adsorption of
   resin I and n-C-7 asphaltenes was evaluated using heavy oil model
   solutions through a combined method of thermogravimetric analysis and
   softening point measurements. Adsorption isotherms were measured for
   individual resin I and n-C-7 asphaltene samples as well as for different
   n-C-7 asphaltene to resin I ratios of 7 : 3, 1: 1 and 7: 3. For the
   first time, competitive adsorption of n-C-7 asphaltene and resin I on
   functionalized nanoparticles with NiO and PdO is assessed. The oxidation
   tests were carried out in an air atmosphere for a specific n-C-7
   asphaltene loading in each sample (ca. 0.20 +/- 0.02 mg m(-2)). In this
   order, for samples adsorbed from different A : R ratios of 7 : 3, 1 : 1
   and 3 : 7, the amounts of resin I adsorbed were 0.06, 0.10 and 0.20 +/-
   0.01 mg m-2, respectively. Hence, the A : R ratios in the adsorbed phase
   were 10 : 3, 2 : 1 and 1 : 1. The catalytic effect was measured through
   thermogravimetric analysis coupled to Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy, which evaluated the effluent gases of the catalytic
   oxidation process. The adsorption isotherms were modeled using the
   solid-liquid-equilibrium (SLE) model, and the effective activation
   energies for the oxidation process of the adsorbate were calculated
   through the non-linear integral method of Vyazovkin (NLN). As a result,
   it was observed that the temperature of n-C-7 asphaltene decomposition
   did not vary significantly with the inclusion of resin I in the system.
   Rate of mass loss curves showed that the main peak temperatures of n-C-7
   asphaltenes and resin I decreased drastically from approximately 500
   degrees C to 250, 260 and 270 degrees C for resin I loadings over
   SNi1Pd1 nanoparticles of 0.20, 0.10 and 0.06 mg m(-2), respectively.
   However, the catalytic effect of the nanoparticles was indeed affected,
   as revealed by the increase in the estimated effective activation energy
   as the amount of resin I in the system increased. It is expected that
   this work opens a better outlook about the use of catalytic
   nanoparticles in the oil and gas industry, mainly in improved (IOR) or
   enhanced oil recovery (EOR) processes for heavy and extra-heavy oil
   upgrading.}},

Abstract = {{The work deals with a method of enhancing laminar, forced convection in
   channels. It is well-known that the inadequate flow mixing process in
   laminar flow is the limiting factor for heat transfer compared with the
   turbulent flow. In this work, vortex shedding (von-Karman vortex)
   technique is used to enhance the rate of heat transfer in a channel
   fitted with off-centre obstacles. Vortex formations at the downstream of
   the obstacles enhance the fluid mixing process; consequently, enhancing
   the rate of heat transfer. The distance between obstacles is selected
   based on fact that at certain the downstream distance of the obstacle,
   the strength of the vortex decays. Lattice Boltzmann method is used to
   solve the governing equations.}},

Abstract = {{When an inertial navigation system regains a valid aiding navigation
   signal after a long-term outage, normal state feedback correction in the
   Kalman filter (KF) will cause a large instantaneous jump in the

   stability. In this paper, we present a partial state feedback correction
   method in the KF to smooth the navigation parameters to solve this
   problem. The idea is to partially correct the navigation state in
   several steps according to the requirement of the guidance and control
   system. The simplicity of this method lies in the fact that no
   additional changes of the filter parameters are needed in the algorithm.
   The capability of residual monitoring and fault detection is the same
   with normal state feedback correction in the KF. Comparative simulation
   results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Postponement strategy and platform-based production are common practices
   of mass customisation to address supply chain challenges due to the
   requirement of product variety. This paper focuses on implementing mass
   customisation through development of semi-finished forms of products
   (vanilla boxes) to reduce supply chain cost and facilitate the
   production process. The challenge is that the possible number of vanilla
   box configurations grows dramatically with the increase in number of
   product variants. In the solution approach, the basic information of
   product variety is captured in a matrix format, specifying the component
   requirements for each product variant. Then, hierarchical clustering is
   applied over the components with the considerations of demands. The
   clustering method consists of three major stages: similarity analysis,
   tree construction and tree-based analysis. The key stage is similarity
   analysis, in which problem-specific information can be incorporated in
   the clustering process. Two numerical examples from the literature are
   used to verify that the clustering approach can yield good-quality
   solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Significant venting of methane gas has been observed on the upper
   continental slopes of the Arctic Ocean, coinciding with the landward
   limit of the gas hydrate stability zone. It has been inferred that the
   methane gas venting is related to the dissociation of methane gas
   hydrate induced by the unprecedented Arctic warming that has occurred
   over the last 30 years. Historically, the influence of hydrate
   dissociation on sediment stability was considered in terms of hydrate
   dissociation increasing pore pressures, reducing effective stress and
   therefore sediment strength, leading to slope failures along these over
   pressurized layers. Recent evidence has shown that gas hydrate readily
   forms in clay-rich sediments as fracture-filled near-vertical veins,
   which upon dissociation gives rise to sediments exhibiting high water
   content, high sediment compressibility and very low shear strength. Thus
   gas hydrate dissociation in fine-grained sediments may lead to
   significant slope instabilities, which at present is poorly understood.
   Slope stability analyses carried out considering the potential influence
   of hydrate dissociation induced by warming of the Arctic slope suggest
   that instabilities are likely, with failures ranging from surficial
   sloughing to deep-seated failures. This paper highlights the importance
   of understanding the sediment processes in clay soils, and how
   dissociation of gas hydrate can induce instabilities through sediment
   softening and generation of excess pore pressure.}},

Abstract = {{One of the key components of real-time bus information systems is
   knowledge of bus locations in real time. With recent advancements in
   sensing and communication technologies, location data can be obtained
   frequently and incorporated into the estimation models. One important
   issue is determining the suitable time interval at which location data
   should be chosen as input for estimation models. This paper explores the
   impact of the time interval of real-time bus location data on the
   accuracy of bus arrival estimation. It also examines by how much, and at
   what distance, real-time arrival information can outperform information
   provided from a static schedule for a given estimation technique. This
   study also investigates the cutoff horizon,' the threshold horizon
   beyond which real-time information no longer outperforms information
   based on a particular static schedule, and how the cutoff horizon
   changes with the time interval of bus location data.}},

Abstract = {{Vulnerability of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals to
   strong radio frequency (RF) signals has resulted in new research needs.
   Based on the type of interference various mitigation schemes have been
   proposed. Antenna array processing is one of the powerful methods for
   interference mitigation. However, data collection using real antenna
   arrays to develop and test array processing methods is considerably
   complex. Therefore, it is very useful to develop a simpler way of
   obtaining array data using a simulation platform.
   This paper introduces a new approach to simulate GNSS signals for an
   antenna array. Employing the user trajectory information recorded using
   a single antenna hardware simulator and the known physical configuration
   of the antenna array, GNSS signals are simulated for each antenna
   element. Additionally, directional interference signals can be generated
   and added to the GNSS signals. Fidelity of single antenna simulations is
   evaluated by comparing the tracking parameters from this simulator with
   two commercially available GNSS simulators, namely the Spirent's
   GSS-7700 and Rohde \& Schwarz's SMBV-100. Simulations are verified by
   evaluating C/N-0 values, carrier Doppler and code phase. Two approaches
   of array signal generation i.e. one based on a reference antenna and
   another based on independent antenna's signal parameters, are compared.
   Capability of the simulator to generate interference scenarios is
   demonstrated with several examples and comparisons in acquisition
   metrics, position errors and beam patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Antenna array processing is gaining attention in the GNSS community due
   to its ability to mitigate different types of interference. Array
   calibration is the first step towards implementation of most of the
   distortionless beamforming techniques. In the case of a GNSS, antenna
   array calibration can be performed using live signals. Since several
   satellite signals are available from different directions at the same
   time, the calibration process can incorporate all available GNSS
   signals. It is required to have a data set without any electronic
   interference or multipath to avoid errors in the calibration process.
   However, multipath is a major challenge for calibration and exists
   almost everywhere. The carrier phase measurements used to estimate the
   calibration parameters are affected by multipath, which introduces
   significant gain and phase errors. Due to this, the calibration
   parameters estimated would normally be erroneous. Carrier phase
   multipath in GNSS is periodic in nature with zero mean. This feature is
   exploited herein to improve calibration in multipath environments. By
   filtering the relative phase measurements between the antenna elements
   over several multipath periods, estimation of calibration parameters can
   be improved. As multipath period is longer for a static user than for a
   moving one, averaging time required to remove multipath is longer in the
   static case. This is demonstrated through simulated and live GNSS
   signals.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of positional and force properties of surgical dissection in
   neurosurgery is essential in developing simulation platforms for
   neurosurgical training such that realistic motion and perception can be
   conveyed to the trainee during practice. Most proposed models in
   literature utilize computational techniques to formulate required
   parameters. However, these models are not realistic enough compared to
   data obtained from experiments on real brain. Therefore, developing a
   setup to measure the position, orientation, and interaction forces will
   help researchers formulate realistic parameters. This paper presents the
   development of such a setup for quantification of displacements and
   tool-tissue interaction forces during performance of microsurgical
   tasks. A bipolar forceps is equipped with a set of force sensing
   elements to measure the tool-tissue interaction force components. The
   position and orientation of the forceps tips are measured by attaching a
   tracker to the bipolar forceps. To show proof-of-concept, an experienced
   surgeon and one assistant surgeon performed 35 neurosurgical tasks (320
   trials) on a cadaver brain (previously frozen) using the instrumented
   setup. Positional and force data of the bipolar forceps were recorded
   during surgical dissection of different brain structures. This paper
   reports results collected from two microsurgical tasks over 40 trials:
   dissection of sylvian cistern arachnoid (SCA) and dissection of middle
   cerebral artery (MCA). Results showed that the mean values of
   interaction forces during dissection of MCA were smaller than dissecting
   SCA. The maximum forces observed were 1.94 N and 1.75 N for SCA and MCA,
   respectively. The application of quantifying such parameters using the
   developed setup will be in training neurosurgery residents using
   surgical simulators in which the knowledge of brain tissue parameters is
   required to formulate the tissue model.}},

Abstract = {{The selective incorporation of a functionalised inorganic component at
   the interface between the Nafion membrane and the catalyst is
   demonstrated to increase the power density of a direct methanol fuel
   cell by 57\% with no other change in operating conditions. The simple
   addition of 0.5 wt\% zeolite (mordenite) in the Nafion `ink,' which is
   used as a glue to fix the precast Nafion membrane onto the catalyst/gas
   diffusion layer, provides an organophobic quality to the MEA which
   enhances performance and durability. The targeted addition of such small
   amounts of the `organophobe' at the interface where the chemical effect
   is required is a novel approach to improving DMFC MEA's and means that
   the usual trade-off between methanol permeability and proton
   conductivity is not observed as proton conductivity is maintained while
   methanol crossover is reduced.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed investigations into the production behavior of heavy oil
   reservoirs under foamy solution gas drive have been conducted
   extensively in the past. Historically, two approaches have been used to
   explain and model the solution gas drive in heavy oil reservoirs. The
   first approach is the base of foamy oil models in which solution gas
   drive is governed by parameters such as compressibility, viscosity,
   nonequilibrium phenomena, and the supersaturation. In the second
   approach, conventional modeling, which we show to be suitable for the
   history matching and prediction of the production data and macroscopic
   modeling of a series of depletion experiments (using a live combination
   of heavy oil and methane gas in a three-dimensional rectangular
   laboratory model), the foamy oil flow mechanism, dispersed flow of gas
   and the supersaturation are nonexistent. The conventional modeling uses
   parameters such as critical gas saturation, very low gas relative
   permeability, and the assumption of no supersaturation in the reservoir.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, various nitrogen-doped (N-doped) multiwall carbon
   nanotubes (MWNTs) were synthesized by varying the synthesis temperature
   (650 degrees C, 750 degrees C and 850 degrees C), and their charge
   storage capability and electromagnetic (EM) shielding effectiveness (SE)
   were assessed by incorporating them into a PVDF (polyvinylidene
   fluoride) matrix. Nitrogen doping was adopted to generate numerous
   polarizable centers in MWNTs. The concentration of nitrogen and
   polarizing centers was optimized by varying the synthesis temperature.
   The nitrogen doping had a significant impact on the structural, thermal,
   and electrical properties of MWNTs. Dielectric spectroscopy of the
   nanocomposites containing self-polarizable MWNTs showed significantly
   low loss tangent, exhibiting good charge storage ability at a given
   concentration of MWNTs. The electrical conductivity of N-doped
   nanocomposites decreased as the synthesis temperature increased from 650
   degrees C to 850 degrees C. This phenomenon was observed to be
   significantly different to the bulk powder. The electrical conductivity
   of the nanocomposites was also reflected in the EM shielding results
   where the nanocomposites containing N-doped MWNTs showed lower shielding
   effectiveness than the un-doped MWNTs. Moreover, the SE decreased with
   increasing synthesis temperature for N-doped MWNTs. Taken together, this
   study demonstrates critical insights about the impact of nitrogen doping
   and synthesis temperature on electrical conductivity, charge storage
   ability, and EM shielding of MWNT polymer-based nanocomposites.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents new environmentally sound and low-cost yet highly
   efficient pyroxene (NaFeSi2O6, PY), known as aegirine, nanoparticles.
   They are applied for the first time for the adsorptive removal of
   violanthrone-79 (VO-79) which was selected as a model-adsorbing compound
   to mimic polar heavy hydrocarbons. PY nanoparticles are prepared by a
   low temperature hydrothermal synthesis route. Controlled particle sizes
   of PY nanoparticles were synthesized in the range between 1 and 100 nm.
   Moreover, the surface and structure of the PY nanoparticles were
   modified by partially replacing some of the original atoms, like Na, Fe
   or Si, by Ce, Zr, Ni, Ca and H to enhance their adsorption capacity
   towards VO-79. One nanoparticle size was prepared at different synthesis
   heat-treating times to investigate the stability of the nano-adsorbent.
   It has been found that PY nanoparticles with particle sizes in the range
   between 30 and 60 nm have the highest adsorption capacity and affinity
   towards VO-79. The adsorption capacity of the VO-79 over functionalized
   PY nanoparticles was increased significantly in the order of PY-H >
   PY-Ca > PY-Ni > PY-Ce > PY-Zr, when compared with unmodified PY
   nanoparticles. Varying the heat-treating time of synthesis of PY
   nanoparticles did not affect their size stability and surface
   properties. Moreover, no significant increase towards VO-79 adsorption
   uptake was detected. The experimental macroscopic adsorption isotherms
   fit well to the Sips model, indicating a heterogeneous adsorption
   system.}},

Abstract = {{With an accelerating rate of data generation, sophisticated techniques
   are essential to meet scalability requirements. One of the promising
   avenues for handling large datasets is distributed storage and
   processing. Further, data summarization is a useful concept for managing
   large datasets, wherein a subset of the data can be used to provide an
   approximate yet useful representation. Consolidation of these tools can
   allow a distributed implementation of data summarization. In this paper,
   we achieve this by proposing and implementing a distributed Gaussian
   Mixture Model Summarization using the MapReduce framework (MR-SGMM). In
   MR-SGMM, we partition input data, cluster the data within each partition
   with a density-based clustering algorithm called DBSCAN, and for all
   clusters we discover SGMM core points and their features. We test the
   implementation with synthetic and real datasets to demonstrate its
   validity and efficiency. This paves the way for a scalable
   implementation of Summarization using Gaussian Mixture Model (SGMM).}},

Abstract = {{A database of difficult-to-forecast natural persistent deep slab
   avalanches was analyzed to determine thresholds for parameters that
   contribute to their release in western Canada. The database included
   avalanche observations and weather station data. The avalanches were
   grouped based on their primary cause-of-release, either precipitation
   loading, wind loading, solar warming or air temperature warming using a
   multivariate classification tree, which first split using a solar
   warming parameter. The precipitation group had a median 24 h snowfall of
   15 cm and 3 d snowfall of 38 cm at weather stations, mostly at or below
   treeline. These amounts were likely closer between 20-30 and 50-80 cm at
   alpine start zones. The wind loading group experienced the most
   wind-transported snow potential. The solar warming group had predicted
   solar warming of 5.2 degrees C, 10 cm into the snowpack, on the days of
   release. The air temperature warming group experienced the highest
   median maximum air temperature (5 degrees C) on the days of release.
   These thresholds may be useful to forecast the likelihood of similar
   avalanches with experienced-based forecasting or with decision aids,
   although many false alarms are possible. A companion paper, Part II,
   relates weather model data to avalanche occurrences.}},

Abstract = {{For 175 difficult-to-forecast persistent deep slab avalanches, weather
   data were obtained from Global Environmental Multiscale (GEM) models
   produced by Environment Canada. The focus was to determine critical
   parameters and thresholds for avalanche forecasting from GEM and compare
   them with weather station data analyzed in Part I (Conlan and Jamieson,
   this issue). The high-resolution GEM-limited-area model (2.5 km
   resolution) forecasted higher median precipitation amounts than both the
   lower-resolution GEM15 (15 km resolution) and weather stations within a
   small dataset. Air temperatures were lower for both weather models
   compared with the weather station data, likely because of elevation
   differences. A multivariate classification tree created with GEM15 data
   correctly classified 29 of 36 avalanches by their primary
   cause-of-release, using a primary split of modelled solar warming of 5.9
   degrees C, 10 cm into the snowpack. For all 175 avalanches, GEM15
   forecasted significantly less precipitation than observed at the weather
   stations, particularly with multi-day cumulative amounts. The majority
   of GEM15 surface wind speeds were between 0 and 10 km h(-1), producing
   negligible wind loading amounts. The parameter values may be helpful for
   predicting future persistent deep slab avalanches. However, GEM output
   is not always representative of field conditions and should be used in
   conjunction with other sources.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the thermal oxidation of an asphaltene model molecule,
   Quinolin-65, was investigated using the density functional theory (DFT)
   and the second-order Moller-Plesset (MP2) perturbation theory. The
   reactions studied involved thermal decompositions as well as the
   interactions between the model molecule and singlet atomic ((OD)-D-1)
   and molecular (O-2(1)Delta D) oxygen. The theoretical study was
   performed under conditions similar to those of the uncatalyzed thermal
   oxidation of asphaltenes. A new reaction pathway for the loss of the
   olefin chain in Quinolin-65 via a 1,3-hydrogen shift mechanism was
   revealed. Thermogravimetric analysis of Quinolin-65 was also performed
   and the reaction products were probed by a mass spectrometer. Both the
   theoretical study and the thermogravimetric analysis concluded that the
   thermo-oxidative decomposition of Quinolin-65 is a complex multi-step
   reaction process, which involves different reaction pathways. The
   thermodynamic parameters obtained in this study showed that the reaction
   process should start with the loss of the olefin chain in the
   Quinolin-65 molecule, followed by the oxidation of the aromatic chain,
   to produce mainly, H2O, CO2, and SO2.}},

Journal = {{STRUCTURE AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Pages = {{490-498}},
Abstract = {{Snow avalanche frequency and magnitude, required for risk analysis, are
   best determined using historical occurrence records. In Canada, reliable
   records are sparse and relatively short term, extending back 30-50
   years. Some Canadian avalanche forecasters suspect that climate change
   has increased avalanche activity in recent years. Should an increasing
   trend exist, analyses based on historical occurrence rates would
   underestimate future risk to people and infrastructure in mountain
   regions. We analyse 30 years of occurrence records to investigate
   whether a trend exists, and assess its strength. A Bayesian hierarchical
   model is used to estimate occurrence rate trends across six geographical
   zones in western Canada. The results suggest that natural avalanche
   occurrence rates have decreased or stayed constant; however, there is a
   very high level of uncertainty. This uncertainty will need to be
   factored into decision-making processes. To assist in this, we discuss
   the effect of long-term changes in avalanche occurrence rates in terms
   of consequences and vulnerability. We also recommend strategies for
   improving mitigation practices so that avalanche control operations can
   better adapt to changing and less predictable environments.}},

Abstract = {{Picosecond pulsed laser source have applications in areas such as
   optical communications, biomedical imaging and supercontinuum
   generation. Direct, modulation of a laser diode with ultrashort,
   current, pulses offers a compact and efficient approach to generate
   picosecond laser pulses. A fully integrated complementary metal
   oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) driver circuit is designed and applied to
   operate a 4 GHz distributed feedback laser (DFB). The CMOS driver
   circuit combines sub-circuits including a voltage-controlled ring
   oscillator, a voltage controlled delay line, an exclusive-or (XOR)
   circuit and a current source circuit. Ultrashort current pulses are
   generated by the XOR circuit when the delayed square wave is XOR'ed with
   the original square wave from the on-chip oscillator. Circuit
   post-layout simulation shows that output current pulses injected into an
   equivalent circuit load of the laser have a pulse full width at half
   maximum (FWHM) of 200 ps, a peak current of 80 mA and a repetition rate
   of 5.8 MHz. This driver circuit is designed in a 0.13 mu m CMOS process
   and taped out On I a 0.3 mm(2) chip area. This CMOS chip is packaged and
   interconnected with the laser diode on a, printed circuit board (PCB).
   The optical output waveform from the laser source is captured by a 5 GHz
   bandwidth photodiode and an 8 GHz bandwidth oscilloscope. Measured
   results show that the proposed laser source can output light pulses with
   a pulse FWHM of 151 ps, a peak power of 6.4 mW (55 mA laser peak forward
   current) and a repetition rate of 5.3 MHz.}},

Title = {{The severity of earthquake events - statistical analysis and
   classification}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{4-24}},
Abstract = {{Earthquake events are natural disasters that can pose a threat to
   people's safety as well as their homes and possessions. In this paper,
   the severity level of earthquake disasters is addressed using the US
   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) database. A total
   of 5841 earthquake incidents are recorded that happened between 2150 BCE
   and 2015 CE. Few studies have done a comprehensive statistical analysis
   of the consequences of earthquakes. To address this gap, and after
   determining the probability distribution function of the number of
   fatalities, we evaluate the distribution of earthquakes with extreme
   fatalities to determine the severity levels according to the
   fatality-based disaster scale introduced by Wirasinghe, Caldera, Durage,
   and Ruwanpura {[}(2013). Preliminary analysis and classification of
   natural disasters. Proceedings of the ninth annual conference of the
   International Institute for Infrastructure, Renewal and Reconstruction
   (IIIRR), Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia, July
   2013, Section B1.2, p. 11]. To this end, three different methods of
   determining the extreme events are considered: peak over threshold, Rth
   order, and event-based and location-based block maxima. Moreover, a
   comprehensive collinearity analysis is performed to investigate any
   correlation and linear dependency between the earthquake parameters
   (magnitude, intensity, and focal depth) and the consequences in terms of
   earthquake fatalities. The severity classification based on block maxima
   has more detailed severity classes; hence, it is superior to the other
   two methods. For block maxima, the probability of a lower level disaster
   (Emergency to Catastrophe Type 1) being the extreme disaster is higher
   for the location (country)-based data set compared to the event-based
   worldwide data set, while the probability of a higher level disaster
   (Catastrophe Type 2 and above) being the extreme disaster is lower.
   These probabilities are to be expected because a single country, even
   over the full time period, is less likely to have a massive disaster
   compared to the world when a large number of extreme events, in this
   case 100, are considered.}},

Title = {{Implementation of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) on an optimal segment of a
   long regular bus route}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{15-29}},
Abstract = {{Major public transit routes evolve overtime due to changes in demand
   caused by variations, for example, in land use, household income. As
   well there are demand/supply interactions due to implementation of new
   transit technologies such as Light Rail Transit or Bus Rapid Transit
   (BRT) and/or changes in mode of service, for example, skip-stop
   operations. Planning for such transitions must be done carefully and
   well in advance to enable on-time implementation. In this paper, we
   consider the transition from a long, regular bus route in a corridor to
   a route with a limited stop BRT along a segment of the corridor and a
   modified regular bus service along its full length. This problem is
   often faced by transit agencies when they try to make decisions
   regarding the design parameters of a BRT service. This transition can
   increase the average speed and maximum possible passenger flow on the
   route. The proposed approach optimizes the headways of the regular and
   BRT routes, and chooses the termini of the BRT segment as well as the
   limited BRT stops. Priority for BRT service is given to O-D pairs with a
   high value of passenger-hours, essentially the `product of the travel
   demand and the travel time'. Total optimal system costs before and after
   the mode transition is considered through analytical modelling, and a
   simple equation is derived for the difference. If the new optimal total
   system cost, including costs associated with passenger in-vehicle travel
   time, waiting time, vehicle operating costs, and system capital costs,
   is lower, the transition is favoured. Insights into the proposed
   transition are provided through the analytical modelling approach.}},

   that is always assumed to be known by most of the existing denoising
   algorithms (so-called nonblind denoising algorithms), which largely
   limits the applicability of these nonblind denoising algorithms in many
   applications. Moreover, these nonblind algorithms do not always achieve
   the best denoised images in visual quality even when fed with the actual
   noise level parameter. To address these shortcomings, in this paper we
   propose a new quality-aware features-based noise level estimator (NLE),
   which consists of quality-aware features extraction and optimal noise
   level parameter prediction. First, considering that image local contrast
   features convey important structural information that is closely related
   to image perceptual quality, we utilize the marginal statistics of two
   local contrast operators, i.e., the gradient magnitude and the Laplacian
   of Gaussian (LOG), to extract quality-aware features. The proposed
   quality-aware features have very low computational complexity, making
   them well suited for time-constrained applications. Then we propose a
   learning-based framework where the noise level parameter is estimated
   based on the quality-aware features. Based on the proposed NLE, we
   develop a blind block matching and three-dimensional filtering (BBM3D)
   denoising algorithm which is capable of effectively removing additive
   white Gaussian noise, even coupled with impulse noise. The noise level
   parameter of the BBM3D algorithm is automatically tuned according to the
   quality-aware features, guaranteeing the best performance. As such, the
   classical block matching and three-dimensional algorithm can be
   transformed into a blind one in an unsupervised manner. Experimental
   results demonstrate that the performance of the BBM3D algorithm is
   superior to its nonblind version both in visual qualitative evaluations
   and quantitative comparisons for various images and noise levels. (C)

Abstract = {{In this work, silane grafted sodium montmorillonite was synthesized by
   gamma-aminopropyltriethoxysilane to make it compatible with organic
   polymers. The grafting reaction was examined by Fourier transform
   infrared (FTIR), Si-29 NMR, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The
   appearance of new peaks for FTIR results confirmed the presence of the
   grafted silane on the clay platelets. Besides, Si-29 NMR results
   revealed another extra resonance which belongs to new bonds formed at
   clay edges and on the internal nanoclay platelets. TGA results confirmed
   that by increasing the amount of silane, the amount of grafting silane
   increased, Which was shown by increase of mass loss. DTG results showed
   that by increasing the amount of aminosilane used for modification, the
   amount of intercalated silane was increased.}},

Abstract = {{The His-Purkinje System (HPS) is responsible for the rapid electric
   conduction in the ventricles. It relays electrical impulses from the
   atrioventricular node to the muscle cells and, thus, coordinates the
   contraction of ventricles in order to ensure proper cardiac pump
   function. The HPS has been implicated in the genesis of ventricular
   tachycardia and fibrillation as a source of ectopic beats, as well as
   forming distinct portions of reentry circuitry. Despite its importance,
   it remains much less well characterized, structurally and functionally,
   than the myocardium. Notably, important differences exist with regard to
   cell structure and electrophysiology, including ion channels,
   intracellular calcium handling, and gap junctions. Very few
   computational models address the HPS, and the majority of organ level
   modeling studies omit it. This review will provide an overview of our
   current knowledge of structure and function (including
   electrophysiology) of the HPS. We will review the most recent advances
   in modeling of the system from the single cell to the organ level, with
   considerations for relevant interspecies distinctions. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{3491-3507}},
Abstract = {{Variation in sequential task processing times is common in manufacturing
   systems. This type of disturbance challenges most scheduling methods
   since they cannot fundamentally change job sequences to adaptively
   control production performance as jobs enter the system because actual
   processing times, are not known in advance. Some research literature
   indicates that simple rules are more suitable than algorithmic
   scheduling methods for adaptive control. In this work, a `state space -
   average processing time' (SS-APT) heuristic is proposed and compared to
   four most commonly used scheduling rules and two well-established
   heuristics based on Taillard's benchmarks. It is shown that the adaptive
   control is made possible under variation in processing times given the
   flexibility and strong performance of the SS-APT heuristic, especially
   for work-in-process inventory control.}},

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{47}},
Pages = {{41622-41629}},
Abstract = {{Intracellular infections caused by invasive pathogens continue to prove
   difficult to combat, due in part to the commonly poor membrane
   permeability of anti-infective drugs. The aim of this study was to
   improve the intracellular delivery of one such poorly permeable (but
   broad-spectrum) anti-infective, gentamicin. Gentamicin was encapsulated
   into liposomal nanocarriers which were then surface functionalized with
   InvA497, a bacteria-derived invasion protein. Treatment of HEp-2 cells
   infected with the enteroinvasive bacteria Yersinia pseudotuberculosis or
   Salmonella enterica with gentamicin-containing, InvA497-functionalized
   liposomes resulted in a significantly greater reduction in infection
   load than treatment with non-functionalized liposomes, indicating that
   such a bacteriomimetic nanocarrier was not only able to promote
   successful cellular uptake of gentamicin but was also able to mediate
   anti-infective drug delivery to both cell cytoplasm and intracellular
   compartments. The developed InvA497-functionalized liposomal nanocarrier
   therefore holds great promise as a strategy for improving the therapy of

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{3201-3215}},
Abstract = {{In robust design, it is common to estimate empirical models that relate
   an output response variable to controllable input variables and
   uncontrollable noise variables from experimental data. However, when
   determining the optimal input settings that minimise output variability,
   parameter uncertainties in noise factors and response models are
   typically neglected. This article presents an interval robust design
   approach that takes parameter uncertainties into account through the
   confidence regions for these unknown parameters. To avoid obtaining an
   overly conservative design, the worst and best cases of mean squared
   error are both adopted to build an optimisation approach. The midpoint
   and radius of the interval are used to measure the location and
   dispersion performances, respectively. Meanwhile, a data-driven method
   is applied to obtain the relative weights of the location and dispersion
   performances in the optimisation approach. A simulation example and a
   case study using automobile manufacturing data from the dimensional
   tolerance design process are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of
   the proposed approach. The proposed approach of considering both
   uncertainties is shown to perform better than other approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Several signal-source impedances (admittances) are required to fully
   characterize the noise behavior of a linear device. This paper expands
   the theory of choosing admittances required for noise parameter
   extraction by finding sets that are guaranteed to form systems of
   linearly independent equations. A minimal set of four admittances is
   chosen from four linearly independent admittance regions. Most prior
   methods require a least-squares solution to noise parameters, using a
   redundant number of admittances. The proposed method employs a direct
   solution to the noise parameters using the four admittances. The
   proposed method also allows adapting the four admittances to overcome
   signal-source admittance-tuner frequency limitations and/or reducing
   uncertainty in the minimum noise factor extraction provided approximate
   knowledge of optimal admittance for minimum noise. The measurement and
   simulation results demonstrated that the adaptable selection criterion
   extracted noise parameters well within 3 sigma uncertainties of noise
   parameters found with patterns previously reported in literature.
   Measurements and theory in this work demonstrate that, in general,
   absolute reflection coefficients of source admittances do not need to
   exceed approximately 0.4 but should also be less than 0.9. The
   flexibility of selecting the signal-source admittances has immediate
   advantages in accurately determining noise parameters of conditionally
   stable amplifiers, low-frequency devices operating beyond the tuner
   specifications, devices operating at high frequencies where tuner losses
   are high, minimizing measurement time, and cases where available
   admittances do not encompass regions required by other methods.}},

Title = {{Activation of Aspen Wood with Carbon Dioxide and Phosphoric Acid for
   Removal of Total Organic Carbon from Oil Sands Produced Water:
   Increasing the Yield with Bio-Oil Recycling}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Several samples of activated carbon were prepared by physical (CO2) and
   chemical (H3PO4) activation of aspen wood and tested for the adsorption
   of organic compounds from water generated during the recovery of bitumen
   using steam assisted gravity drainage. Total organic carbon removal by
   the carbon samples increased proportionally with total pore volume as
   determined from N-2 adsorption isotherms at -196 degrees C. The
   activated carbon produced by CO2 activation had similar removal levels
   for total organic carbon from the water (up to 70\%) to those samples
   activated with H3PO4, but lower yields, due to losses during pyrolysis
   and activation. A method to increase the yield when using CO2 activation
   was proposed and consisted of recycling bio-oil produced from previous
   runs to the aspen wood feed, followed by either KOH addition (0.48\%) or
   air pretreatment (220 degrees C for 3 h) before pyrolysis and
   activation. By recycling the bio-oil, the yield of CO2 activated carbon
   (after air pretreatment of the mixture) was increased by a factor of
   1.3. Due to the higher carbon yield, the corresponding total organic
   carbon removal, per mass of wood feed, increased by a factor of 1.2 thus
   improving the overall process efficiency.}},

Title = {{An instrumented spatial linkage for measuring knee joint kinematics}},
Journal = {{KNEE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{43-48}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background: In this study, the design and development of a highly
   accurate instrumented spatial linkage (ISL) for kinematic analysis of
   the ovine stifle joint is described. The ovine knee is a promising
   biomechanical model of the human knee joint
   Methods: The ISL consists of six digital rotational encoders providing
   six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) to its motion. The ISL makes use of the
   complete and parametrically continuous (CPC) kinematic modeling method
   to describe the kinematic relationship between encoder readings and the
   relative positions and orientation of its two ends. The CPC method is
   useful when calibrating the ISL, because a small change in parameters
   corresponds to a small change in calculated positions and orientations
   and thus a smaller optimization error, compared to other kinematic
   models. The ISL is attached rigidly to the femur and the tibia for
   motion capture, and the CPC kinematic model is then employed to
   transform the angle sensor readings to relative motion of the two ends
   of the linkage, and thereby, the stifle joint motion.
   Results: The positional accuracy for ISL after calibration and
   optimization was 03 +/- 0.2 mm (mean +/- standard deviation). The ISL
   was also evaluated dynamically to ensure that accurate results were
   maintained, and achieved an accuracy of 0.1 mm.
   Conclusions: Compared to the traditional motion capture methods, this
   system provides increased accuracy, reduced processing time, and ease of
   use. Future work will be on the application of the ISL to the ovine gait
   and determination of in vivo joint motions and tissue loads. (C) 2015

Title = {{Ligament and meniscus loading in the ovine stifle joint during normal
   gait}},
Journal = {{KNEE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{70-77}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background: The ovine stifle joint is an ideal preclinical model to
   study knee joint biomechanics. Knowledge of the ovine ligamentous and
   meniscal loading during normal gait is currently limited.
   Methods: The in vivo kinematics of the ovine stifle joint (N = 4) were
   measured during ``normal{''} gait using a highly accurate instrumented
   spatial linkage (ISL, 0.3 +/- 0.2 mm). These motions were reproduced in
   vitro using a unique robotic testing platform and the loads carried by
   the anterior/posterior cruciate ligaments (ACL/PCL), medial/lateral
   collateral ligaments (MCL/LCL), and medial/lateral menisci (MM/LM)
   during gait were determined.
   Results: Considerable inter-subject variability in tissue loads was
   observed. The load in the ACL was near zero at hoof-strike (0\% gait)
   and reached a peak (100 to 300 N) during early-stance (similar to 10\%
   gait). The PCL reached a peak load (200 to 500 N) just after hoof-strike
   (similar to 5\% gait) and was mostly unloaded throughout the remainder
   of stance. Load in the MCL was substantially lower than the cruciate
   ligaments, reaching a maximum of 50 to 100 N near the beginning of
   stance. The LCL carried a negligible amount of load through the entire
   gait cycle. There was also a major contribution of the MM and LM to load
   transfer from the femur to the tibia during normal gait The total
   meniscal load reached a maximum average between 350 and 550 N during
   gait.
   Conclusion: Knowledge of joint function during normal motion is
   essential for understanding normal and pathologic joint states. The
   considerable variability in the magnitudes and patterns of tissue loads
   among animals simulates clinical variability in humans. (C) 2015

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate alternative distributed clustering
   techniques for wireless sensor node tracking in an industrial
   environment. The research builds on extant work on wireless sensor node
   clustering by reporting on: (1) the development of a novel distributed
   management approach for tracking mobile nodes in an industrial wireless
   sensor network; and (2) an objective comparison of alternative cluster
   management approaches for wireless sensor networks. To perform this
   comparison, we focus on two main clustering approaches proposed in the
   literature: pre-defined clusters and ad hoc clusters. These approaches
   are compared in the context of their reconfigurability: more
   specifically, we investigate the trade-off between the cost and the
   effectiveness of competing strategies aimed at adapting to changes in
   the sensing environment. To support this work, we introduce three new
   metrics: a cost/efficiency measure, a performance measure, and a
   resource consumption measure. The results of our experiments show that
   ad hoc clusters adapt more readily to changes in the sensing
   environment, but this higher level of adaptability is at the cost of
   overall efficiency.}},

   zeolite support. Further investigation indicated that during the
   reaction ZSM-5 framework mainly promotes the deoxygenation and improves
   the quality of bio-oil, while the highly dispersed Zn species mostly
   facilitate CH4 activation and allow it to be incorporated into the
   carbon chain of the bio-oil and enhances the quantity of bio-oil. The
   synergistic effects between ZSM-5 framework and Zn species made this
   process be able to not only upgrade the quality of bio-oil, but also
   produce more oil product.}},

Journal = {{CATALYSIS SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{6}},

Pages = {{1201-1213}},
Abstract = {{It is highly desirable to upgrade viscous heavy oil, such as bitumen
   extracted from Canadian oil sand, to be transportable by pipeline.
   Conventionally, this is achieved by expensive catalytic hydrogenation
   under a hydrogen pressure of 15-20 MPa. In this study, it is reported
   that by using zinc and silver cation-modified HZSM-5 as the catalyst,
   methane can be activated at a low temperature of 380 degrees C and a
   pressure of 5 MPa to efficiently upgrade heavy oil, leading to the
   formation of partially upgraded crude oil which is more desirable for
   pipeline transportation and downstream refining. In addition, methane
   activation and its participation in the upgrading process were further
   evidenced by employing butylbenzene, styrene, and benzene as model
   compounds to represent heavy oil. This study opens a door for upgrading
   heavy oil with natural gas under fairly mild operation conditions
   instead of expensive hydrogen under rather stringent ones.}},

Title = {{Assessment of Measurement Distortions in GNSS Antenna Array Space-Time
   Processing}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Antenna array processing techniques are studied in GNSS as effective
   tools to mitigate interference in spatial and spatiotemporal domains.
   However, without specific considerations, the array processing results
   in biases and distortions in the cross-ambiguity function (CAF) of the
   ranging codes. In space-time processing (STP) the CAF misshaping can
   happen due to the combined effect of space-time processing and the
   unintentional signal attenuation by filtering. This paper focuses on
   characterizing these degradations for different controlled signal
   scenarios and for live data from an antenna array. The antenna array
   simulation method introduced in this paper enables one to perform
   accurate analyses in the field of STP. The effects of relative placement
   of the interference source with respect to the desired signal direction
   are shown using overall measurement errors and profile of the signal
   strength. Analyses of contributions from each source of distortion are
   conducted individually and collectively. Effects of distortions on GNSS
   pseudorange errors and position errors are compared for blind,
   semi-distortionless, and distortionless beamforming methods. The results
   from characterization can be useful for designing low distortion filters
   that are especially important for high accuracy GNSS applications in
   challenging environments.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{38}},
Pages = {{77-86}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{To compete in the market, manufacturers often need to offer multiple
   product variants to different customers. Given such a challenge of
   product variety to supply chain, the postponement strategy has been
   adapted that the differentiating modules are handled at the later stage
   of the process to minimize the impacts from demand variations. Given the
   information of product variants and their mix ratios, this paper focuses
   on the problem of structuring supply chain network that indicates the
   precedence orders of suppliers and sub-assemblers. The solution approach
   is based on hierarchical clustering, in which the tree structure is
   applied to construct the supply chain network. One core technique is to
   investigate the coupling values between the modules by characterizing
   the grouping condition the structuring process. A complexity measure is
   also adopted to compare the quality of resulting supply chain networks.
   Five numerical examples are utilized to demonstrate the applicability
   and effectiveness of the proposed clustering method. (C) 2015 The

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Methane biofilter (MBF) is a promising bioprocess technology capable of
   attenuating point-source and low-volume methane emissions from
   anthropogenic sources. Water availability is one of the most important
   factors affecting the growth of microorganisms; hence, water retention
   capacity (WRC) is a key determinant of the performance of granular
   filter materials when used as microbial growth media. Considering the
   difficulty in conducting extensive laboratory experiments to determine
   WRC of competing granular materials, the availability of a simple, but
   accurate, model for the assessment of WRC of granular materials could be
   an asset for practicing engineers involved in the design and operation
   of MBFs. This paper presents results from an assessment of the
   applicability of Peleg model for the estimation of WRC of granular
   materials that can be used as filter media in MBFs. Results show that
   there is high correlation between the laboratory determined water
   desorption values and the values predicted by Peleg model.}},

   tetragonal structure with an average crystallite size of 18 nm. The
   stretching and vibration modes of SnO2 were confirmed using Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy. The size of SnO2 nanoparticles was
   determined using particle size analyser, which was found be 60 +/- 10 nm
   on average. The surface morphology of the nanoparticles was investigated
   using scanning electron microscope, which showed irregular-sized
   agglomerated SnO2 nanostructures. In addition, primary particle size was
   evaluated using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, which
   was found to be 50 nm on average. The polyvinyl alcohol/SnO2 composite
   thin film was prepared on a glass substrate using spin-coating method.
   The values of band gap energy and electrical conductance of 13-layer

   dielectric permittivity and dielectric loss with frequency, confirming
   the role of BaTiO3 as insulative barrier. The positive impact of BaTiO3

Abstract = {{This paper presents a hybrid pedestrian navigation algorithm based on
   investigation of different combinations of pedestrian dead-reckoning
   (PDR), WiFi fingerprinting, and magnetic matching (MM). A multilevel
   quality-control mechanism is developed based on the interaction between
   different techniques. The algorithms were evaluated by walking in two
   indoor environments, with two smartphones, and under four motion
   conditions (i.e., handheld, at an ear, dangling with hand, and in a
   pants pocket). It was found that 2D accuracy of WiFi fingerprinting and
   MM is related with received signal strength and magnetic distribution,
   respectively. MM results had small errors on some occasions but suffered
   from significant mismatches. WiFi-aided MM provided better results than
   either WiFi or MM, but still had a risk of mismatching. Furthermore,
   integration of PDR, WiFi, and MM reduced dependency on both navigation
   environment and motion condition. The proposed algorithm provided more
   reliable solutions than both PDR/WiFi and PDR/MM, especially in areas
   with poor WiFi signal distribution or indistinctive magnetic features.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we have prepared CO2-in-water foam by mixing partially
   hydrophobic SiO2 nanoparticles and sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl)
   sulfosuccinate (AOT) and studied its properties. The observation of the
   appearance of the foam revealed that, with the continuous addition of
   AOT, the phase behavior of the SiO2 nanoparticle and the AOT mixed
   system transformed from that of a two-phase system of aggregated
   nanoparticles into that of a uniform dispersed phase. Both foaming
   ability and foam stability were optimized when the nanoparticles and the
   AOT were mixed in a proportion of 1 : 5. On the basis of our findings
   from measurements of the dispersion properties, including measurements
   of the adsorption isotherm of the surfactant on the nanoparticles, zeta
   potentials, interfacial tension and the three-phase contact angle, we
   concluded that the synergistic interactions between the SiO2
   nanoparticles and the AOT led to the adsorption of nanoparticles around
   the bubble surface and the formation of a spatial network structure of
   nanoparticles in the film, thereby enhancing the mechanical strength of
   the bubble and improving the resistance to outside disturbances,
   deformation and drainage. Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LCSM)
   analysis of the same foams further confirmed the existence of a
   ``viscoelastic shell'' wrapped around and protecting the bubble.}},

Title = {{Characterization of Produced and Residual Oils in the CO2 Flooding
   Process}},
Journal = {{ENERGY \& FUELS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},

Pages = {{54-62}},

Abstract = {{In immiscible CO2 flooding processes, the injected CO2 extracts light
   and intermediate components from reservoir hydrocarbons, changing the
   properties of both the produced and residual oils. CO2 injection also
   increases asphaltene precipitation, which further causes adverse effects
   on the oil effective permeability, operational facilities, and the oil
   recovery. In this study, six CO2 flooding followed by blowdown processes
   are carried out in the laboratory under four CO2 injection pressures and
   two temperatures, and the properties of produced and residual oils are
   further characterized. It is found that uneven residual oil distribution
   occurred due to the coupled effects of viscous fingering and oil
   properties changes during CO2 flooding process. Characterization of the
   produced oil shows that both the produced oil density and viscosity
   decrease when CO2 injection pressure increases. The asphaltenes content
   of the oil produced after CO2 breakthrough is found to be relatively
   lower than that of the oil samples collected before CO2 breakthrough. In
   addition, the produced oil becomes lighter as the CO2 injected volume
   increases. The saturates content in the residual oil decrease
   considerably in comparison with original crude oil in the CO2 miscible
   flooding process. Furthermore, this study discovers that asphaltene
   component in produced oils is more stable than that in residual oils
   based on asphaltene-to-resin ratio (ATR) analysis. Finally, incremental
   oil recoveries of 2.78\%11.72\% can be experimentally achieved through
   blowdown processes that are carried out after a 30 min soaking period.
   The laboratory study not only shows that blowdown processes can be
   successfully applied to improve the performance of CO2 flooding
   processes, but also provides a deep understanding of properties changes
   of produced and residual oils in CO2-enhanced oil recovery processes.}},

Title = {{Wettability Alteration during Low-Salinity Waterflooding and the
   Relevance of Divalent Ions in This Process}},
Journal = {{ENERGY \& FUELS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{72-79}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{From laboratory and field test results, it is now largely agreed that
   reducing the overall salinity, especially the concentration of divalent
   ions of the injected water, can markedly improve the oil recovery.
   However, as a result of the complexity of the crude oilbrinerock (COBR)
   system, there is no clear explanation of why the divalent cations (Ca2+)
   are of major significance in a low-salinity water effect (LSWE). In the
   present paper, spontaneous imbibition, zeta-potential measurements,
   static adsorption/desorption of benzoic acid (BA) onto crushed Berea,
   and BA self-assembled layers on silica wafer have been performed to
   correlate macroscopic wettability alteration during low-saline water
   flood with the microscopic release of the hydrophobic layers (organic
   acid layers) on mineral surfaces and explain the relevance of active
   cations (Ca2+) in this process, thereby providing a better understanding
   of the underlying mechanisms of a LSWE. Spontaneous imbibition results
   show that initial wettability of the COBR system was dominantly
   controlled by the initial concentration of Ca2+ rather than Na+ in
   brine; i.e., the initial wettability changed to be more oil-wet with an
   increasing concentration of CaCl2 in initial water, while changing the
   concentration of NaCl in initial water had little effect on initial
   wettability. Moreover, reducing salinity of imbibing brine can
   outstandingly improve oil recovery of cores aged by CaCl2 brine, whereas
   no obvious enhanced oil recovery (EOR) by low-salinity water was
   observed for cores aged by NaCl brine. Decreasing the concentration of
   either CaCl2 or NaCl brine was able to make the oil/brine and brine/rock
   interfaces become less positively charged or even more negatively
   charged, observed by zeta-potential measurements, resulting in increased
   electrostatic repulsive forces between the oil/brine and brine/rock
   interfaces. These results suggest that the anionic groups of organic
   acid from crude oil, such as carboxylate, adsorb onto negatively charged
   mineral surfaces mainly through calcium bridges instead of van der Waals
   forces or sodium bridges and reducing salinity is able to increase the
   electrostatic repulsive forces between mineral surfaces and carboxylate
   groups and then break calcium bridges to change the wettability of the
   rock surface to be less oil-wet, and as a result, EOR occurs. These
   suggestions were supported by the static adsorption/desorption studies
   and self-assembly experiments. After sorption to crushed Berea, the
   varied BA concentration in the supernatant analyzed by total organic
   carbon (TOC) reveals that the presence of the background electrolyte
   Ca2+ largely enhanced sorption in comparison to Na+. Lowering salinity
   was able to desorb BA from crushed Berea. Field emission scanning
   electron microscopy (FESEM) was used to obtain the microchemical
   composition and morphology of the wafer surface interacted with BA under
   different ionic strengths and solution cations (Ca2+ and Na+). Ca2+ ions
   were found to enhance the adsorption of BA self-assembled layers on a
   silica wafer compared to Na+, which directly demonstrates that BA
   molecules mainly self-assemble on SiO2 by calcium bridges rather than
   sodium bridges or van der Waals forces. The BA self-assembled layers
   were released after immersing organo-wafer into deionized water.}},

Abstract = {{The dissolution of organic matter into water via oxidative processes,
   named oxycracking, has been practiced for a long time for the removal of
   organic pollutants, in which oxygen induces breakage and
   functionalization of organic molecules. Recently, oxycracking has been
   explored as an alternative approach to handling the increased amount of
   solid residues produced in oil sands upgrading activities that involve
   carbon rejection in solvent deasphalting units. This study uses an
   asphaltene-rich feedstock, operationally known as petroleum pitch,
   isolated from an Athabasca bitumen vacuum residue, which was submitted
   to oxycracking reactions at 200 and 220 degrees C. The feed and
   water-soluble fractions isolated at pH 1, termed acid-soluble oxidized
   asphaltenes (ASOA), were analyzed by ultrahigh-resolution mass
   spectrometry {[}Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass
   spectrometry (FTICR-MS)] using electrospray and atmospheric pressure
   photoionization ion sources. FTICR-MS analysis revealed extensive
   oxidation of all compound classes originally present in the
   asphaltene-rich feed. Double bond equivalent (DBE) distribution plots
   show that sequential carboxylation (formation of a carboxyl group)
   occurs progressively with an increasing reaction temperature, leading to
   the incorporation of up to 15 oxygen atoms per molecule, whereas
   simultaneous decarboxylation reactions produce a CO2-rich gas phase.
   ASOA samples also show lower overall carbon number distributions than
   the asphaltene feed, which is direct evidence of CC bond cleavage during
   the oxycracking process. In addition, molecular fragments detected in
   ASOA after carboncarbon bond cleavages showed not only lower carbon
   numbers but also lower DBEs per molecule, consistent with a more
   dominant archipelago architecture for the parent asphaltene molecules.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of resin I
   on the adsorption behavior of n-C-7 asphaltenes onto silica and hematite
   nanoparticles. It is worthwhile to mention, for the first time, that
   competitive adsorption of n-C-7 asphaltene and resin I over
   nanoparticles is reported. Indeed, a novel method based on
   thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and softening point (SP) measurements
   was used for the simultaneously construction of adsorption isotherms of
   n-C-7 asphaltenes and resins. The adsorption experiments were conducted
   in the batch mode at different n-C-7 asphaltene to resin I (A:R) ratios
   of 7:3, 1:1, and 3:7 and different concentrations of the
   asphaltene-resin mixture from 500 mg/L to 5000 mg/L. The adsorption
   isotherms were described by the solidliquid equilibrium (SLE) model. The
   results showed different shapes of the adsorption isotherms according to
   the A:R ratio. However, the nanoparticles become more selective for
   asphaltene at a high asphaltene/resin ratio. In addition, the amount of
   n-C-7 asphaltenes adsorbed at any of the A:R ratios evaluated was
   successfully predicted from a known amount adsorbed at a determined A:R
   ratio, following a simple rule of three. Results indicated that resin I
   does not have significant influence on the adsorbed amount of
   asphaltenes, showing that resin I has a solvent-like behavior, such as
   toluene, mainly at low concentrations (<3000 mg/L).}},

Title = {{Visual-LiDAR Odometry Aided by Reduced IMU}},
Journal = {{ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a method for combining stereo visual odometry, Light
   Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) odometry and reduced Inertial Measurement
   Unit (IMU) including two horizontal accelerometers and one vertical
   gyro. The proposed method starts with stereo visual odometry to estimate
   six Degree of Freedom (DoF) ego motion to register the point clouds from
   previous epoch to the current epoch. Then, Generalized Iterative Closest
   Point (GICP) algorithm refines the motion estimation. Afterwards,
   forward velocity and Azimuth obtained by visual-LiDAR odometer are
   integrated with reduced IMU outputs in an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)
   to provide final navigation solution. In this paper, datasets from KITTI
   (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota technological Institute)
   were used to compare stereo visual odometry, integrated stereo visual
   odometry and reduced IMU, stereo visual-LiDAR odometry and integrated
   stereo visual-LiDAR odometry and reduced IMU. Integrated stereo
   visual-LiDAR odometry and reduced IMU outperforms other methods in urban
   areas with buildings around. Moreover, this method outperforms simulated
   Reduced Inertial Sensor System (RISS), which uses simulated wheel
   odometer and reduced IMU. KITTI datasets do not include wheel odometry
   data. Integrated RTK (Real Time Kinematic) GPS (Global Positioning
   System) and IMU was replaced by wheel odometer to simulate the response
   of RISS method. Visual Odometry (VO)-LiDAR is not only more accurate
   than wheel odometer, but it also provides azimuth aiding to vertical
   gyro resulting in a more reliable and accurate system. To develop
   low-cost systems, it would be a good option to use two cameras plus
   reduced IMU. The cost of such a system will be reduced than using full
   tactical MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Sensor) based IMUs because two
   cameras are cheaper than full tactical MEMS based IMUs. The results
   indicate that integrated stereo visual-LiDAR odometry and reduced IMU
   can achieve accuracy at the level of state of art.}},

Abstract = {{This paper derives exact expressions for the output impedance of a
   voltage-excited (current-excited) linear network without having to
   nullify (kill) the exciting source or disconnect the load. The derived
   expressions show that the instantaneous output impedance is both source
   and load dependent, but when the source is nullified, the output
   impedance becomes independent of the load, as expected. For some special
   networks, the output impedance is also independent of the load. The
   expressions are verified for a number of known circuit setups and
   experimentally on a gyrator-based linear network, which has an output
   impedance that can switch between positive and negative values.

   become insoluble and precipitate in the open fracture. When the driving

Title = {{Identification of joint dynamics in 3D structures through the inverse
   receptance coupling method}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{105}},
Pages = {{135-145}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Complex structures, such as machine tool centers, are comprised of
   several components attached through different types of joint. The joints
   introduce much flexibility and damping to the entire structure, which
   cannot be ignored in the design stage. Ignoring joint effects and
   modeling the joints as rigid connections result in deviations between
   the physical structure dynamics and model dynamics. In order to improve
   the accuracy of model predictions, joint dynamic properties need to be
   identified and incorporated into a virtual model. Many studies have
   investigated joint identification in two-dimensional structures.
   However, different degrees of freedom (DOFs), including rotational and
   translational, are coupled in the motions of actual physical structures.
   An accurate joint model should include translational and rotational
   frequency response functions (FRFs) and consider the joint's inertial
   properties. In this study, the inverse receptance coupling method is
   utilized to obtain a joint's FRFs by using the FRFs of the assembled
   structure and substructures. Unlike previous studies, which considered
   only 2 DOFs for the joint element, this study proposes a linear joint
   model with 6 DOFs at each node to include the effects of translational
   and rotational FRFs. The proposed model also considers the joint's
   inertial properties and cross FRF terms between translational and
   rotational DOFs, which have been previously neglected. The joint's FRFs
   are obtained using only translational FRFs of the assembled structure,
   which makes this method practical in real applications, as there are
   many limitations regarding the measurement of rotational FRFs. Finite
   element simulations along with experimental tests are conducted to
   investigate the applicability of the proposed method for actual physical
   structures. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{265-285}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Foam is injected in the subsurface to improve mobility control through
   the increase in the effective gas viscosity, e.g., in CO-based enhanced
   oil recovery processes. As fine-textured foam has higher viscosity, it
   is envisaged to achieve an optimal foam texture and to maintain it for
   the entire period of an application. However, mechanisms of foam
   formation and destruction, which affect texture, are difficult to
   regulate. In this study, we investigate the synergic effect of
   nanoparticles and surfactant on the foam texture and the effective gas
   viscosity () during transport in a porous medium. Experiments using
   glass-bead packs were performed injecting CO and a solution containing
   either only surfactant or surfactant and nanoparticles. During each
   experiment, the pressure drop () through the porous medium was measured
   to follow the generation of the foam. A two-phase flow mechanistic model
   combining the mass conservation law for water and CO and the population
   balance equation of the lamellae was implemented to analyze the
   experiments and predict foam transport under the investigated
   conditions. The constitutive equations for foam generation and
   destruction were based on the dominant role of pressure gradient on
   lamella division and of capillary pressure on bubble coalescence, and
   their parameters were estimated using pressure drop measurements. Both
   equations were formulated for a surfactant-stabilized foam, and it was
   the aim of this work to understand their validity also for the case of a
   nanoparticle-stabilized foam. The experiments compare well with the
   theory showing that a foam stabilized with nanoparticles and surfactant
   can be modeled as a surfactant-stabilized foam. Overall, increases
   smoothly while the foam forms and, upon breakthrough, it stabilizes
   around a constant value while approaching steady state. During this
   phase, oscillations occur, particularly when high-quality foam is
   generated as the system is close to its critical conditions of capillary
   pressure and water saturation. When steady state is reached, the
   effective gas viscosity varies with and solution composition and
   significantly increases when surfactant and nanoparticles are added. The
   maximum value of is 0.110 Pa s for = 0.75, which is almost twofold of
   the maximum value attained when only a surfactant is used, corresponding
   to 0.067 Pa s at = 0.4. This suggests that when nanoparticles and
   surfactant are employed, they can favor the formation of a strong
   high-quality CO-foam.}},

   geodetic boundary value problem (GBVP) approach is studied as a rigorous
   method for connecting two or more vertical datums through computed datum
   offsets from a global equipotential surface defined by a GOCE-based
   geoid. The so-called indirect bias term, the effect of the GOCE geoid
   omission error, the effect of the systematic levelling datum errors and
   distortions, and the effect of the geodetic data errors on the datum
   unification are four important factors affecting the practical
   implementation of this approach. These factors are investigated
   numerically using the GNSS-levelling and tide gauge stations in Canada,
   the USA, Alaska, and Mexico. The results show that the indirect bias
   term can be omitted if a GOCE-based global geopotential model is used in
   gravimetric geoid computations. The omission of the indirect bias term
   simplifies the linear system of equations for the estimation of the
   datum offset(s). Because of the existing systematic levelling errors and
   distortions in the Canadian and US levelling networks, the datum offsets
   are investigated in eight smaller regions along the Canadian and US
   coastal areas. Using GNSS-levelling stations in the US coastal regions,
   the mean datum offset can be estimated with a 1 cm standard deviation if
   the GOCE geoid omission error is taken into account by means of the
   local gravity and topographic information. In the Canadian Atlantic and
   Pacific regions, the datum offsets can be estimated with 2.3 and 3.5 cm
   standard deviation, respectively, using GNSS-levelling stations.
   However, due to the low number of tide gauge stations, the standard
   deviation of the CGVD28 and NAVD88 datum offsets can reach one decimetre
   in the Pacific regions. With the available GNSS-levelling stations in
   Alaska and Mexico, the NAVD88 datum offset can be estimated with a
   standard deviation below 3 cm. The numerical investigations of this
   study provide, for the first time, the datum offsets between North
   American vertical datums and their associated standard deviations with
   which the offsets can be estimated. The results of this study
   demonstrate the importance of the aforementioned four factors in the
   practical implementation of the GBVP approach for the unification of the
   levelling-based vertical datums.}},

Abstract = {{This article focuses on the static and dynamic behavior of two concretes
   under very high pressure loaded at different strain rates. Concretes
   differ by the type of coarse aggregates (limestone or siliceous).
   Specimens are confined in an elastic steel ring, insuring a
   quasi-uniaxial strain state of loading during axial compression, the
   so-called quasi-oedometric compression (QOC) tests. The effect of the
   loading path is first investigated by comparing their response under
   static QOC tests to triaxial compression results. Compaction of concrete
   made with strong siliceous aggregates is much higher in QOC test than in
   triaxial compression test, contrary to concrete made with soft limestone
   aggregates. Both concretes are then subjected to Split Hopkinson
   Pressure Bar testing. At high strain rate volumetric stiffness and
   deviatoric strength of both concretes are increased. Moreover, the
   increase of concrete strength with strain rate is more pronounced for
   concrete made with limestone aggregates than with siliceous aggregates.

Abstract = {{Long-term changes of the global climate system have been observed.
   However, the effect of long-term changes in the climate system on
   avalanche hazard in mountainous areas remains inconclusive. For this
   study we analyzed long-term weather, snow cover, and avalanche data from
   Glacier National Park. Weather and snow cover data were-measured at two
   sites (1315 m and 1905 m a.s.l). The avalanche data were observed along
   the section of the Trans Canada Highway within the park. Meteorological
   data were analyzed by winter season, i.e. early, mid and late winter,
   represented by three-month periods between September and May. Increasing
   trend's were found for the mean seasonal air temperature at both
   stations during the mid season. Trends for the solid precipitation rate
   were not significant, indicating no trend towards more rain events.
   Decreasing trends of the maximum snow depth were only found for the
   lower elevation station at Rogers Pass for the mid and late season,
   which is consistent with decreasing trends for all seasons of the mean
   24-hour new snow amounts at the lower elevation and for the mid season
   at the higher elevation station at Mt. Fidelity. Due to uncertainty
   arising from changes in explosive control, we draw no conclusions
   regarding the regional change of avalanche activity. However, the
   weather and snowpack trends observed in Glacier National Park are
   consistent with longer time series from mountains With similar latitudes
   and elevations in France and Switzerland. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{The demand for high data rates and broadband wireless access
   necessitates the development of radio systems that use multiband
   signals. With the deployment of these systems, the radio-frequency front
   ends and power amplifiers (PAs) used exhibit many nonlinear effects
   leading to signal distortions. The use of a linearization technique is
   necessary to enhance the linearity-efficiency tradeoff. This brief
   explores new schemes suitable for the modeling and linearization of
   transmitters suffering from hardware imperfections when driven with
   dual-band signals. An enhanced and accurate 2-D Cartesian memory
   polynomial model (2DECMPM) is proposed to compensate for hardware
   impairments such as the in-phase and quadrature-phase (I-Q) imbalance
   and dc offset in addition to nonlinear distortion. From an accuracy
   perspective, the proposed model offers better compensation performance,
   mainly due to the use of additional cross-terms between I and Q signals
   compared to the 2-D joint memory polynomial model (2DJMPM). Experimental
   results show that the proposed 2DECMPM-based predistorter enabled
   superior PA linearization and I-Q imbalance compensation with a
   comparable complexity with the state-of-the-art 2DJMPM model.}},

Abstract = {{This brief describes a methodology for designing broadband power
   amplifiers (PAs) based on the manipulation of second-harmonic impedance.
   The proposed approach starts from the inverse class-F (F-1) design
   specification and extends it to a family of specifications that allow
   achieving better than class-B performance in terms of output power and
   drain efficiency. It is shown that the achievable performance can be
   maintained over a wide frequency range reaching 57\% of fractional
   bandwidth. As such, the proposed approach permits higher flexibility and
   offers relaxed matching constraints in implementing broadband
   high-efficiency PAs. For the experimental implementation, the proposed
   approach is adopted to implement a broadband PA using a 10-W
   gallium-nitride transistor. Peak drain efficiencies greater than 75\%
   are measured over carrier frequencies between 500 and 900 MHz. The
   saturated output power levels, on the other hand, are higher than 10 W
   with a maximum of 13 W. Measured results are confirmed to be in good

Abstract = {{In linear cooperative spectrum sensing, the weights of secondary users
   and detection threshold should be optimally chosen to minimize missed
   detection probability and to maximize secondary network throughput.
   Since these two objectives are not completely compatible, we study this
   problem from the viewpoint of multiple-objective optimization. We aim to
   obtain a set of evenly distributed Pareto solutions. To this end, here,
   we introduce the normal constraint (NC) method to transform the problem
   into a set of single-objective optimization (SOO) problems. Each SOO
   problem usually results in a Pareto solution. However, NC does not
   provide any solution method to these SOO problems, nor any indication on
   the optimal number of Pareto solutions. Furthermore, NC has no
   preference over all Pareto solutions, while a designer may be only
   interested in some of them. In this paper, we employ a stochastic global
   optimization algorithm to solve the SOO problems, and then propose a
   simple method to determine the optimal number of Pareto solutions under
   a computational complexity constraint. In addition, we extend NC to
   refine the Pareto solutions and select the ones of interest. Finally, we
   verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods through
   computer simulations.}},

Abstract = {{The cracking activity of a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalyst
   containing novel zeolite Y nanoparticles fabricated using mesoporous
   silica (average particle size of 150 nm) was examined and compared with
   the performance of other catalysts. The activity experiments were
   carried out in a fluidized bench-scale batch riser simulator reactor.
   The bulky probing compound of 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene (TIPB) was
   cracked to lighter compounds over a catalyst containing 25\% of the
   developed zeolite. The synthesized sodium-type zeolite nanoparticles
   were subjected to two cycles of ion-exchange treatment using ammonium
   sulfate and lanthanum chloride and then to calcination. To investigate
   the effects of particle size on the activity, three additional catalysts
   were prepared with the mean particle size of the supported zeolites
   ranging from 450 to 1800 nm. The preparation of the FCC catalysts was
   conducted by mixing the highly aqueous dispersed zeolite Y nanoparticles
   with colloidal silica-alumina as a matrix and silica sol as a binder.
   The results of the catalytic cracking of TIPB demonstrated the
   significant effect of the size reduction of the synthesized zeolite Y
   nanoparticles on the catalytic performance of the catalyst. The FCC
   catalyst that contained zeolite Y nanoparticles (150 nm) showed superior
   conversion and selectivity percentages for the main products. The
   results of this study have a direct implication on the preparation of
   colloidal catalysts containing zeolite Y nanoparticles, which form
   stable emulsion with petroleum products. These emulsions can be utilized
   for slurry and ebullated bed reactors in heavy oil upgrading
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the effects of elastic and plastic deformations on
   corrosion of an aluminum bronze alloy in 3.5\% NaCl solution were

   the induced elastic or plastic deformation. Elastic deformation
   resulting from application of elastic stresses would not affect
   (increase) appreciably the corrosion activity of the alloy. However,
   plastic deformation resulting from application of plastic pre-strain
   enhances the corrosion activity of the alloy significantly. Thus, the
   mechanoelectrochemical effect on the alloy corrosion is negligible under
   elastic deformation, but it is great at the plastic deformation stage.}},

Abstract = {{Rotary-steerable drilling provides unique features such as an extended
   reach and accurate well trajectory control. These characteristics can
   notably increase drilling efficiency and safety. One of the main
   technical difficulties of rotary-steerable drilling is dynamically
   measuring the spatial attitude at the bottom of the rotating drillstring
   as the drillstring rotates. We developed a strap-down measurement
   system, with a triaxial accelerometer and triaxial magnetometers
   installed near the bit. The inclination and azimuth can be measured in
   real time even as the drillstring rotates. Although the magnetic system
   is the norm, we can use this system to achieve continuous measurement
   while drilling; to achieve this, a novel state-space model is proposed
   here and the Kalman filter is used to estimate the states. Simulation
   and experiments show that a continuous-survey system with a Kalman
   filter approach can improve measurement precision and reduce errors
   produced by drillstring vibration.}},

Title = {{Estimation of CO2-brine interfacial tension using an artificial neural
   network}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SUPERCRITICAL FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{107}},
Pages = {{31-37}},

Abstract = {{Experimental determination of CO2-brine interfacial tension (IFT)
   usually requires expensive apparatus and sophisticated interpretation
   procedure and is time-consuming. Hence, it is of practical importance to
   develop an accurate and reliable model for determining the CO2-brine
   IFT. This paper presents the use of feed forward artificial neural
   network (ANN) to accurately estimate CO2-brine IFT based on a database
   acquired from previous literature. The database consists of a total of
   1716 CO2-brine IFT datasets that cover relatively large ranges of
   pressure (0.1-60.05 MPa), temperature (5.25-175 degrees C), total
   salinity (0-5 mol kg(-1)) and mole fractions (0-80\%) of impure
   components. Six independent variables were considered to develop the IFT
   estimation model: pressure, temperature, monovalent cation (Na+ and K+)
   molality, bivalent cation (Ca2+ and Mg2+) molality in brine, and mole
   fractions of N-2 and CH4 in injected CO2 streams. The ANN topology was
   optimized by trial-and-error in order to enhance its capability of
   generalization and the optimal one was determined to be 6-10-20-1 (10
   and 20 neurons in the first and second hidden layers, respectively). The
   accuracy of the proposed ANN model was highlighted by four evaluation
   matrices, namely mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute relative error
   (MARE), mean squared error (MSE), and determination coefficient (R-2)
   between the measured and estimated IFT. The ANN model was further
   compared against four empirical IFT correlations developed in previous
   studies. It was observed that the ANN model outperforms significantly
   the empirical correlations and provides the most accurate IFT
   reproduction with respect to pure CO2-pure water, pure CO2-brine and
   impure CO2 systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The color night-vision technology is advantageous to scene
   interpretation by displaying original monochrome night-vision imagery
   with colors, leading the future trend of night-vision development. Until
   recently, the methods of color night-vision are mostly based on
   multi-band sensor fusion that do not apply to thermal systems which are
   only sensitive to one spectral band. To address this, we present a novel
   technique in this paper aiming to directly give thermal videos day-time
   color appearance. We observe that the interframe pixel's luminance
   changing over thermal videos approximately follows a Double Lomax
   distribution. Based on this observation and computational reasons, we
   propose a star-shape mask for pixel matching. We further show how the
   mask can be used for efficient thermal video colorization. Additionally,
   considering the accumulating errors in sequence, we propose a simple
   region-similarity based abnormal color correction mechanism. Experiments
   on real applied thermal night-vision videos show that our method can
   efficiently render single-band thermal sequence with correct colors at
   12-33 frame-per-second (fps), providing observers with enhanced facility
   of surrounding recognition and target recognition. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this study methylene blue (MB) has been investigated for its
   adsorption and subsequent catalytic thermo-oxidative decomposition on
   surface of maghemite (gamma-Fe2O3) nanoparticles. The experimental
   adsorption isotherm fit well to the Freundlich model, indicating
   multi-sites adsorption. Computational modeling of the interaction
   between the MB molecule and gamma-Fe2O3 nanoparticle surface was carried
   out to get more insights into its adsorption behavior. Adsorption
   energies of MB molecules on the surface indicated that there are
   different adsorption sites on the surface of gamma-Fe2O3 confirming the
   findings regarding the adsorption isotherm. The catalytic activity of
   the gamma-Fe2O3 nanoparticles toward MB thermo-oxidative decomposition
   has been confirmed by subjecting the adsorbed MB to a thermo oxidation
   process up to 600 degrees C in a thermogravimetric analyzer. The
   experimental results showed a catalytic activity for post adsorption
   oxidation. The oxidation kinetics were studied using the Ozawa-Flyn-Wall
   (OFW) corrected method. The most probable mechanism functions were fifth
   and third orders for virgin MB and MB adsorbed onto gamma-Fe2O3
   nanoparticles, respectively. Moreover, the results of thermodynamic
   transition state parameters, namely changes in Gibbs free energy of
   activation (Delta G(double dagger)), enthalpy of activation (Delta
   H-double dagger), and entropy of activation (Delta S-double dagger),
   emphasized the catalytic activity of gamma-Fe2O3 nanoparticles toward MB
   oxidation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Home energy management (HEM) schemes persuade residential customers to
   actively participate in price-based demand response (DR) programs. In
   these price-based HEM methods, a controller schedules the energy
   consumption of household's controllable appliances in response to
   electricity price signals, considering various customer preferences.
   Although numerous methods have been recently proposed for HEM
   application, prioritizing the operation of controllable appliances from
   the customer's viewpoint in price-based HEM has not been addressed,
   which is the focus of the present paper. To do this, the value of lost
   load (VOLL) of each appliance is defined to indicate the operational
   priority of that appliance from the customer perspective. Considering
   appliances' VOLL, electricity tariffs, and operational constraints of
   appliances, an optimization problem is proposed to minimize customer
   energy and reliability costs. The output of the proposed HEM would be
   the optimum scheduling of household electrical demand. Numerical studies
   illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed HEM method in a smart home,
   considering different time-varying electricity pricings. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The memory polynomial model is widely used for the behavioural modelling
   of radio-frequency non-linear power amplifiers having memory effects.
   One challenging task related to this model is the selection of its
   dimension which is defined by the non-linearity order and the memory
   depth. This study presents an approach suitable for the selection of the
   model dimension in memory polynomial-based power amplifiers' behavioural
   models. The proposed approach uses a hybrid criterion that takes into
   account the model accuracy and its complexity. The proposed technique is
   tested on two memory polynomial-based behavioural models. Experimental
   validation carried out using experimental data of two Doherty power
   amplifiers, built using different transistor technologies and tested
   with two different signals, illustrates consistent advantages of the
   proposed technique as it significantly reduces the model dimension by
   more than 60\% without compromising its accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Forecasts suggest that production of bitumen from oil sands reservoirs
   will increase by a factor of at least 2.5 times over roughly the next 15
   years. Although a significant economic benefactor to the Canadian
   economy, there are challenges faced by oil sands operators with respect
   to greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption. For the Athabasca
   deposit, the current oil recovery process of choice is the SAGD
   (steam-assisted gravity drainage) method where high temperature and high
   pressure steam is injected into the oil sands formation. At present,
   there are more than ten SAGD operators in Alberta, Canada and results to
   date reveal that the geology of the reservoir impacts SAGD performance.
   Given the growth of the SAGD industry in Alberta, forecasting tools are
   required that can predict performance versus reservoir characteristics.
   Here, we present a neural network-based model to predict the SOR
   (steam-to-oil ratio) in oil sands reservoirs by using log and core data
   to characterize the reservoir porosity, permeability, oil saturation,
   depth and thickness. Our analysis confirms that the lower the porosity,
   permeability, and oil saturation of the reservoir, the worse the
   performance of the operation. In other words, the lower the quality of
   the reservoir, the lower the oil rate, and the higher the SOR. Our
   analysis also shows that well performance (i.e., SOR), is predictable
   with a relatively high degree of accuracy (R-2 similar to 0.80) using
   log and core data via a neural network model. These results imply that
   the depth of the reservoir, gamma ray readings, and permeability are the
   most important determinants of the variation in SOR. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{162}},
Pages = {{55-64}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Injection of CO2 into depleted oil reservoirs can result in incremental
   oil recovery to help offset the cost of CO2 storage. This paper presents
   a thorough study of the effects of nitrogen on CO2 minimum miscibility
   pressure (MMP) for CO2 storage in depleted oil reservoirs. Nitrogen
   diluted CO2 MMPs for 55 model oil samples were calculated using the
   Peng-Robinson Equation of State (PR EOS) in the temperature range of
   305-360 K. Based on the modeling results, an analytical equation has
   been developed for predicting the ratio of impure CO2 MMP to pure CO2
   MMP, F-imp. In this equation, F-imp is expressed as a function of the
   pseudo-critical temperature of the impure CO2, the critical pressures of
   CO2 and N-2, and the reservoir temperature. For oil samples with
   molecular weights lower than a certain minimum value (M-min) at various
   temperatures, a chart has been created for supplying a coefficient in
   the equation. Compared to commonly used F-imp correlations in the
   literature, this new correlation yields a more accurate match to the
   F-imp data found in the literature. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Cartilage boundary lubrication synergism is mediated by hyaluronan
   concentration and PRG4 concentration and structure}},
Journal = {{BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Proteoglycan 4 (PRG4) and hyaluronan (HA) are key synovial
   fluid constituents that contribute synergistically to cartilage boundary
   lubrication; however, the effects of their concentrations as well as
   their structure, both of which can be altered in osteoarthritis, on this
   functional synergism are unknown. The objectives of this study were to
   evaluate cartilage boundary lubricating ability of 1) PRG4 + HA in
   solution at constant HA concentration in a range of PRG4 concentrations,
   2) constant PRG4 concentration in a range of HA concentrations, 3) HA +
   reduced/alkylated (R/A) PRG4, and 4) hylan G-F 20 + PRG4.
   Methods: Static and kinetic friction coefficients (mu(static,Neq,) <
   mu(kinetic,Neq)>) were measured using a previously characterized
   cartilage-cartilage boundary mode friction test for the following
   concentrations of purified PRG4 and HA: Test 1: HA (1.5 MDa, 3.3 mg/mL)
   + PRG4 from 4.5 - 1500 mu g/mL; Test 2: PRG4 (450, 150, 45 mu g/mL) + HA
   (1.5 MDa) from 0.3 -3.3 mg/mL. Test 3: hylan G-F 20 (3. 3 mg/mL)+ PRG4
   (450 mu g/mL). Test 4: HA (3.3 mg/mL) + R/A PRG4 (450 mu g/mL). ANOVA
   was used to compare lubricants within (comparing 6 lubricants of
   interest) and between (comparing 3 lubricants of interest) test
   sequences, with Tukey and Fishers post-hoc testing respectively.
   Results: This study demonstrates that both PRG4 and HA concentration, as
   well as PRG4 disulfide-bonded structure, can alter the cartilage
   boundary lubricating ability of PRG4 + HA solutions. The boundary
   lubricating ability of high MW HA + PRG4 solutions was limited by very
   low concentrations of PRG4. Decreased concentrations of high MW HA also
   limited the cartilage boundary lubricating ability of HA + PRG4
   solutions, with the effect exacerbated by low PRG4 concentrations. The
   reduction of friction by addition of PRG4 to a cross-linked HA
   viscosupplement product, but not with addition of R/A PRG4 to HA, is
   consistent with a non-covalent mechanism of interaction where tertiary
   and quaternary PRG4 structure are important.
   Conclusions: Collectively, these results demonstrate that deficiency of
   either or both PRG4 and HA, or alterations in PRG4 structure, may be
   detrimental to SF cartilage boundary lubricating function. This study
   provides further insight into the nature of cartilage boundary
   lubrication and advancement towards potential formulation of new
   intra-articular biotherapeutic treatments for osteoarthritis using PRG4
   +/- HA.}},

Journal = {{ARTHRITIS RESEARCH \& THERAPY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: Lubricin/proteoglycan-4 (PRG4) is a mucinous glycoprotein
   secreted by synovial fibroblasts and superficial zone chondrocytes. PRG4
   has a homeostatic multifaceted role in the joint. PRG4 intra-articular
   treatment retards progression of cartilage degeneration in pre-clinical
   posttraumatic osteoarthritis models. The objective of this study is to
   evaluate the binding of recombinant human PRG4 (rhPRG4) and native human
   PRG4 (nhPRG4) to toll-like receptors 2 and 4 (TLR2 and TLR4) and whether
   this interaction underpins a PRG4 anti-inflammatory role in synovial
   fluid (SF) from patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid
   arthritis (RA).
   Methods: rhPRG4 and nhPRG4 binding to TLR2 and TLR4 was evaluated using
   a direct enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Association of
   rhPRG4 with TLR2 and TLR4 overexpressing human embryonic kidney (HEK)
   cells was studied by flow cytometry. Activation of TLR2 and TLR4 on HEK
   cells by agonists Pam3CSK4 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was studied in
   the absence or presence of nhPRG4 at 50, 100 and 150 mu g/ml. Activation
   of TLR2 and TLR4 by OA SF and RA SF and the effect of nhPRG4 SF
   treatment on receptor activation was assessed. PRG4 was
   immunoprecipitated from pooled OA and RA SF. TLR2 and TLR4 activation by
   pooled OA and RA SF with or without PRG4 immunoprecipitation was
   compared.
   Results: rhPRG4 and nhPRG4 exhibited concentration-dependent binding to
   TLR2 and TLR4. rhPRG4 associated with TLR2- and TLR4-HEK cells in a
   time-dependent manner. Co-incubation of nhPRG4 (50, 100 and 150 mu g/ml)
   and Pam3CSK4 or LPS reduced TLR2 or TLR4 activation compared to Pam3CSK4
   or LPS alone (p <0.05). OA SF and RA SF activated TLR2 and TLR4 and
   nhPRG4 treatment reduced SF-induced receptor activation (p <0.001). PRG4
   depletion by immunoprecipitation significantly increased TLR2 activation
   by OA SF and RA SF (p <0.001).
   Conclusion: PRG4 binds to TLR2 and TLR4 and this binding mediates a
   novel anti-inflammatory role for PRG4.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel minimally-invasive catheter-based acoustic
   interrogation device for real-time monitoring the dynamics of the lower
   esophageal sphincter (LES). Dysfunction of the LES could result
   gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease
   (GERD). A micro-oscillator actively emitting sound wave at 16 kHz is
   located at one side of the LES, and a miniature microphone is located at
   the other side of the LES to capture the sound generated from the
   oscillator. Thus, the dynamics of the opening and closing of the LES can
   be monitored. The device was tested in vitro by utilizing a
   custom-designed LES simulator, as well as in vivo in a pilot canine
   model. In the in vitro test, the sound was captured by the microphone
   and its strength was correlated with the level of LES opening and
   closing which was controlled by the simulator. The measurements showed
   statistically significant (p < 0.05) Pearson correlation coefficients
   (0.905 on the average in quiet environment and 0.736 on the average in
   noisy environment, DOF = 9). In the in vivo test, the LES was forced
   open and closed by a transoral endoscope, which was monitored in
   real-time by a transpyloric endoscope inserted from the duodenum and
   positioned into the distal stomach. Frame-by-frame video analysis
   validated the interrelation between the sound strength and the LES
   opening and closing. The LES dynamics monitored by the proposed device
   has the potential to become a valuable minimally-invasive technique for
   understanding LES dysfunction.}},

Abstract = {{Tornado hazards are destructive forms of extreme weather phenomena
   associated with severe thunderstorms, which threaten life and property.
   Proper mitigation actions in the pre-touchdown phase of a tornado can
   avoid or significantly reduce the disastrous effects. The results of an
   empirical study to develop a novel model to obtain the tornado time
   trend in the Canadian Prairies are presented. The time from warning
   issuance to completion of a protective action and the associated
   reliability of the tornado detection, warning and communication system
   currently in place is analyzed, through an activity network simulation
   plus stated preference analysis, and compared with the stated ideal
   warning lead time. Tornado warning data in the Canadian Prairies such as
   false warnings and missed events are analyzed. Using the inferences
   drawn from these analyses, a more efficient system to mitigate the
   impact of tornadoes is proposed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Background This paper presents the experimental evaluation of three
   commercially available haptic hand-controllers to evaluate which was
   more suitable to the participants.
   Methods Two surgeons and seven engineers performed two peg-in-hole tasks
   with different levels of difficulty. Each operator guided the
   end-effector of a Kuka manipulator that held surgical forceps and was
   equipped with a surgical microscope. Sigma 7, HD2 and PHANToM Premium
   3.0 hand-controllers were compared. Ten measures were adopted to
   evaluate operators' performances with respect to effort, speed and
   accuracy in completing a task, operator improvement during the tests,
   and the force applied by each haptic device.
   Results The best performance was observed with the Premium 3.0; the
   hand-piece was able to be held in a similar way to that used by surgeons
   to hold conventional tools.
   Conclusions Hand-controllers with a linkage structure similar to the
   human upper extremity take advantage of the inherent human brain
   connectome, resulting in improved surgeon performance during
   robotic-assisted surgery. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{With the development of face recognition using sparse representation
   based classification (SRC), many relevant methods have been proposed and
   investigated. However, when the dictionary is large and the
   representation is sparse, only a small proportion of the elements
   contributes to the l(1)-minimization. Under this observation, several
   approaches have been developed to carry out an efficient element
   selection procedure before SRC. In this paper, we employ a metric
   learning approach which helps find the active elements correctly by
   taking into account the interclass/intraclass relationship and manifold
   structure of face images. After the metric has been learned, a
   neighborhood graph is constructed in the projected space. A fast
   marching algorithm is used to rapidly select the subset from the graph,
   and SRC is implemented for classification. Experimental results show
   that our method achieves promising performance and significant
   efficiency enhancement.}},

Journal = {{MICROMACHINES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{12}},

Abstract = {{In the recent years horizontal drilling (HD) has become increasingly
   important in oil and gas exploration because it can increase the
   production per well and can effectively rework old and marginal vertical
   wells. The key element of successful HD is accurate navigation of the
   drill bit with advanced measurement-while-drilling (MWD) tools. The size
   of the MWD tools is not significantly restricted in vertical wells
   because there is enough space for their installation in traditional well
   drilling, but the diameter of devices for HD must be restricted to less
   than 30 mm for some applications, such as lateral drilling from existing
   horizontal wells. Therefore, it is essential to design miniature devices
   for lateral HD applications. Additionally, magnetometers in traditional
   MWD devices are easily susceptible to complex downhole interferences,
   and gyroscopes have been previously suggested as the best avenue to
   replace magnetometers for azimuth measurements. The aim of this paper is
   to propose a miniature gyroscope-based MWD system which is referred to
   as miniature gyroscope-based while drilling (MGWD) system. A prototype
   of such MGWD system is proposed. The device consists of a two-axis
   gyroscope and a three-axis accelerometer. Miniaturization design
   approaches for MGWD are proposed. In addition, MGWD data collection
   software is designed to provide real-time data display and navigation
   algorithm verification. A fourth-order autoregressive (AR) model is
   introduced for stochastic noise modeling of the gyroscope and the
   accelerometer data. Zero velocity and position are injected into a
   Kalman filter as a system reference to update system states, which can
   effectively improve the state observability of the MGWD system and
   decrease estimation errors. Nevertheless, the azimuth of the proposed
   MGWD system is not observable in the Kalman filter, and reliable azimuth
   estimation remains a problem.}},

Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{29893-29909}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{With the increased availability of regional reference networks, Precise
   Point Positioning (PPP) can achieve fast ambiguity resolution (AR) and
   precise positioning by assimilating the satellite fractional cycle
   biases (FCBs) and atmospheric corrections derived from these networks.
   In such processing, the atmospheric corrections are usually treated as
   deterministic quantities. This is however unrealistic since the
   estimated atmospheric corrections obtained from the network data are
   random and furthermore the interpolated corrections diverge from the
   realistic corrections. This paper is dedicated to the stochastic
   modelling of atmospheric corrections and analyzing their effects on the
   PPP AR efficiency. The random errors of the interpolated corrections are
   processed as two components: one is from the random errors of estimated
   corrections at reference stations, while the other arises from the
   atmospheric delay discrepancies between reference stations and users.
   The interpolated atmospheric corrections are then applied by users as
   pseudo-observations with the estimated stochastic model. Two data sets
   are processed to assess the performance of interpolated corrections with
   the estimated stochastic models. The results show that when the
   stochastic characteristics of interpolated corrections are properly
   taken into account, the successful fix rate reaches 93.3\% within 5 min
   for a medium inter-station distance network and 80.6\% within 10 min for
   a long inter-station distance network.}},

Journal = {{BIOINSPIRATION \& BIOMIMETICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Rapid pitch-up has been highlighted as a mechanism to generate large
   lift and drag during landing manoeuvres. However, pitching rates had not
   been measured previously in perching birds, and so the direct
   applicability of computations and experiments to observed behaviour was
   not known. We measure pitch rates in a small, wild bird (the
   black-capped chickadee; Poecile atricapillus), and show that these rates
   are within the parameter range used in experiments. Pitching rates were
   characterized by the shape change number, a metric comparing the rate of
   frontal area increase to acceleration. Black-capped chickadees increase
   the shape change number during perching in direct proportion to their
   total kinetic and potential energy at the start of the manoeuvre. The
   linear relationship between dissipated energy and shape change number is
   in accordance with a simple analytical model developed for
   two-dimensional pitching and decelerating airfoils. Black-capped
   chickadees use a wing pitch-up manoeuvre during perching to dissipate
   energy quickly while maintaining lift and drag through rapid area
   change. It is suggested that similar pitch-and-decelerate manoeuvres
   could be used to aid in the controlled, precise landings of small
   manoeuvrable air vehicles.}},

Title = {{Transient flow analysis and partial water relative permeability curve
   derivation for low permeability undersaturated coalbed methane wells}},

Abstract = {{Rate transient analysis (RTA) is an important reservoir engineering tool
   used to extract reservoir and stimulation information from flow rates
   and pressures obtained from producing wells. Adaptation of analytical
   RTA methods for this purpose has been slow for coalbed methane (CBM)
   reservoirs because of the complexities of multi-phase flow, non-static
   absolute permeability, desorption, among others. Some progress has been
   made historically for high permeability CBM reservoirs, where depletion
   (boundary-dominated flow) occurs quickly, however low permeability CBM
   reservoirs are currently being evaluated internationally (e.g. China),
   which brings forward additional challenges. For example, in some
   instances, low permeability, undersaturated CBM wells exhibit long
   periods of transient flow, during which the transition from single-phase
   flow of water to two-phase flow of gas and water occurs. This behavior
   has not been dealt with rigorously in the development of analytical RTA
   methods. It is the purpose of the current work to extend RTA to apply to
   low-permeability, undersaturated CBM wells exhibiting this behavior.
   The horizontal CBM well studied in this work exhibits two periods of
   apparent transient linear flow separated by a transition, as determined
   from diagnostic analysis of water production data using a log-log plot
   of rate-normalized pressure (RNP) versus time. It is hypothesized that
   the well actually exhibits transient linear flow throughout the entire
   studied production period (supported by reservoir simulation) and that
   productivity changes leading to the apparent transition in flow regime
   are caused by the combined effects of relative permeability changes
   after desorption pressure is reached, and (possibly) fines migration and
   stress-dependent permeability. In order to extend the early single-phase
   linear flow analysis of this well (occurring above desorption pressure)
   to the multi-phase period (below desorption pressure), the RNP
   half-slope trend (linear flow) established during the single-phase flow
   period is extrapolated through the rest of the production period. An RNP
   ratio (RNPR) is then created by calculating the ratio of the
   extrapolated (corrected) RNP and the RNP of the uncorrected field data.
   The RNPR can then serve to correct the production data affected by
   multi-phase flow (and possibly fines migration and stress dependent
   permeability) and hence extend the amount of data that can be used for
   production analysis. Further, the RNPR squared, combined with water
   saturation calculations, may be used to derive water relative
   permeability curves from the transient data. These concepts are tested
   using both numerical simulation and field data. The resulting
   field-derived water relative permeability curve can be used as a solid
   starting point for simulation history-matching, although it covers a
   limited range of water saturations.
   This work should be of interest to professional engineers and
   geoscientists involved in CBM reservoir characterization efforts. Future
   work will determine if these concepts are applicable to other
   low-permeability reservoirs exhibiting the transition from single- to
   multi-phase flow during the transient linear flow period, such as tight
   oil and gas condensate reservoirs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In conventional MIMO radars, transmitting waveforms are usually assumed
   to be mutually orthogonal. This is also the case for MIMO passive radar
   when the transmitters occupy non-overlapping frequency channels, such as
   the FM-based MIMO passive radar. For the single frequency network
   (SFN)-based MIMO passive radar (SMPR), all illuminators transmit the
   same content at the same frequency simultaneously, that makes the signal
   indistinguishable. Therefore, one has to solve the
   measurement-to-transmitter association herein in addition to the
   standard measurement-to-target association in conventional MIMO radars.
   This paper investigates the non-standard target tracking for SMPR. A
   novel approach is proposed to achieve real-time operation as well as
   nearly optimal performance. Simulation results show comparable
   performance to the case with known association. Moreover, the
   feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated using field
   experimental data.}},

Title = {{Impact of biofilm on bacterial transport and deposition in porous media}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{183}},
Pages = {{109-120}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Laboratory scale experiments were conducted to obtain insights into
   factors that influence bacterial transport and deposition in porous
   media According to colloidal filtration theory, the removal efficiency
   of a filter medium is characterized by two main factors: collision
   efficiency and sticking efficiency. In the case of bacterial transport
   in porous media, bacteria attached to a solid surface can establish a
   thin layer of biofilm by excreting extracellular polymeric substances
   which can significantly influence both of these factors in a porous
   medium, and thus, affect the overall removal efficiency of the filter
   medium. However, such polymeric interactions in bacterial adhesion are
   not well understood and a method to calculate polymeric interactions is
   not yet available. Here, to determine how the migration of bacteria
   flowing within a porous medium is affected by the presence of
   surface-associated extracellular polymeric substances previously
   produced and deposited by the same bacterial species, a commonly used
   colloidal filtration model was applied to study transport and deposition
   of Pseudomonasfluorescens in small-scale columns packed with clean and
   biofilm coated glass beads. Bacterial recoveries were monitored in
   column effluents and used to quantify biofilm interactions and sticking
   efficiencies of the biofilm coated packed-beds. The results indicated
   that, under identical hydraulic conditions, the sticking efficiencies in
   packed-beds were improved consistently by 36\% when covered by biofilm.

Abstract = {{In this work MoO2 nanoparticles were prepared using ethylene glycol as a
   reducing agent and their transformation into the desired phase
   beta-Mo(2)c (hexagonal) was followed by in-situ X-ray diffraction with
   synchrotron radiation. CH4/H-2 was employed as carburizing mixture and
   two different concentrations were tested, 10 and 20\% v/v. TEM images
   obtained indicated that the particle size of the oxide precursor was
   about 4 nm while the XRD patterns showed that an amorphous phase
   precipitated along with the crystalline phase. This amorphous phase
   seemed to decrease the onset temperature of carburization and its
   transformation started before the crystalline MoO2. On the other hand,
   an effect from the orientation of the (011), (-211) and (022) faces of
   the MoO2 precursor toward a less energy demanding transformation might
   be occurring as well. The carburization process of the amorphous
   phase/MoO2 nanoparticles started at about 560 degrees C, while in
   contrast for a commercial MoO2 such process began at the temperature
   commonly reported in the literature (similar to 670 degrees C). The
   hexagonal, thermodynamically stable phase of the Mo2C was the main
   carburization product and no other intermediate phases were detected by
   XRD. The gas stream of the reaction was analyzed by mass spectrometry
   indicating the formation of CO and H2O as by-products of the formation
   of the carbide. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A lot of effort has been put into accurately modelling virtual
   prototypes prior to physical building of structures, in order to
   minimize cost and time while improving performance. However, there are
   often significant discrepancies between the dynamics of virtual
   prototypes and actual physical structures, which are mainly caused by
   improper joint dynamics modelling and assumptions. To overcome these
   challenges, we propose a method for the identification of multiple
   joints in structures using the inverse receptance coupling method. This
   method enables the determination of the joint properties by finding the
   differences between the measured receptances of the assembled structures
   and the simulated receptances obtained from rigidly coupled
   substructures. The receptances are obtained either through the finite
   element model or experimental modal measurements. The only measurements
   required in the proposed identification method are measurements on the
   translational degrees of freedom of the substructures and assembled
   structure. Knowing the joint's dynamic properties allows for the
   prediction of behavior of a new assembled structure that uses the same
   joint configuration, without the necessity of direct measurements on the
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose-Among patients with acute ischemic stroke, we
   determine computed tomographic perfusion (CTP) thresholds associated
   with follow-up infarction at different stroke onset-to-CTP and
   CTP-to-reperfusion times.
   Methods-Acute ischemic stroke patients with occlusion on computed
   tomographic angiography were acutely imaged with CTP. Noncontrast
   computed tomography and magnectic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging
   between 24 and 48 hours were used to delineate follow-up infarction.
   Reperfusion was assessed on conventional angiogram or 4-hour repeat
   computed tomographic angiography. T-max, cerebral blood flow, and
   cerebral blood volume derived from delay-insensitive CTP postprocessing
   were analyzed using receiver-operator characteristic curves to derive
   optimal thresholds for combined patient data (pooled analysis) and
   individual patients (patient-level analysis) based on time from stroke
   onset-to-CTP and CTP-to-reperfusion. One-way ANOVA and locally weighted
   scatterplot smoothing regression was used to test whether the derived
   optimal CTP thresholds were different by time.
   Results-One hundred and thirty-two patients were included. T-max
   thresholds of >16.2 and >15.8 s and absolute cerebral blood flow
   thresholds of <8.9 and <7.4 mL.min(-1.)100 g(-1) were associated with
   infarct if reperfused <90 min from CTP with onset <180 min. The
   discriminative ability of cerebral blood volume was modest. No
   statistically significant relationship was noted between stroke
   onset-to-CTP time and the optimal CTP thresholds for all parameters
   based on discrete or continuous time analysis (P>0.05). A statistically
   significant relationship existed between CTP-to-reperfusion time and the
   optimal thresholds for cerebral blood flow (P<0.001; r=0.59 and 0.77 for
   gray and white matter, respectively) and T-max (P<0.001; r=-0.68 and
   -0.60 for gray and white matter, respectively) parameters.
   Conclusions-Optimal CTP thresholds associated with follow-up infarction
   depend on time from imaging to reperfusion.}},

Abstract = {{The estimated cost of reducing carbon emissions through the deployment
   of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in power systems vary by a factor of
   five or more across studies published over the past 8 years. The
   objective of this paper is to understand the contribution of
   techno-economic variables and modeling assumptions to explain the large
   variability in the published international literature on cost of avoided
   CO2 (CACO2) using statistical methods. We carry out a meta-analysis of
   the variations in reported CACO2 for coal and natural gas power plants
   with CCS. We use regression and correlation analysis to explain the
   variation in reported CACO2. The regression models built in our analysis
   have strong predictive power (R-2 > 0.90) for all power plant types. We
   find that the parameters that have high variability and large influence
   on the value of CACO2 estimated are levelized cost of electricity (LCOE)
   penalty, capital cost of CCS, and efficiency penalty. In addition, the
   selection of baseline technologies and more attention and transparency
   around the calculation of capital costs will reduce the variability
   across studies to better reflect technology uncertainty and improve
   comparability across studies. 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Incorporation of electricity GHG emissions intensity variability into
   building environmental assessment}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{159}},
Pages = {{62-69}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Current building energy and GHG emissions assessments do not account for
   the variable performance of the electric grid. Incorporating hourly grid
   variability into building assessment methods can help to better
   prioritize energy efficiency measures that result in the largest
   environmental benefits. This article proposes a method to incorporate
   GHG emissions intensity changes due to grid variability into building
   environmental assessment. The proposed method encourages building
   systems that reduce electricity use during peak periods while accounting
   for differences in grid GHG emissions intensity (i.e., peak shaving is
   more strongly encouraged in grids that have GHG intense peak
   generation).
   A set of energy saving building technologies are evaluated in a set of
   building variants (office, residential) and grid types (hydro/nuclear
   dominated, coal/gas dominated) to demonstrate the proposed method.
   Differences between total GHG emissions calculated with the new method
   compared with the standard (which assumes a constant GHG emissions
   intensity throughout the year) are in the 5-15\% range when the
   contribution of electricity to total GHG emissions is more significant.
   The influence of the method on the assessment of the relative
   performance of some energy efficiency measures is much higher. For
   example, the estimated GHG emissions savings with heat pumps and
   photovoltaics can change by 40\% and +20\%, respectively, using the new
   assessment method instead of the standard. These differences in GHG
   emissions estimates can influence building design decisions. The new
   method could be implemented easily, and would lead to better decision
   making and more accurate estimates of the emissions from buildings and
   building technologies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The center of pressure (COP) movement in studies of postural control
   reveals a highly regular structure (low entropy) over short time periods
   and a highly irregular structure over large time scales (high entropy).
   Entropic half-life (EnHL) is a novel measure that quantifies the time
   over which short-term temporal correlations in a time series deteriorate
   to an uncorrelated, random structure. The current study suggested and
   tested three hypotheses about how characteristics of the neuromuscular
   postural control system may affect stabilometric EnHL: (H1) control
   system activity hypothesis: EnHL decreases with increased frequency of
   control system interventions adjusting COP motion; (H2) abundance of
   states hypothesis: EnHL decreases with increased number of mechanically
   equivalent states available to the postural system; and (H3) neurologic
   process hierarchy hypothesis: EnHL increases if postural control
   functions shift from the spinal level to the motor cortex. Thirty
   healthy participants performed quiet stance tests for 90 s in 18
   different conditions: stance (bipedal, one-legged, and tandem); footwear
   (bare foot, regular sports shoe, and rocker sole shoes); and
   simultaneous cognitive task (two-back working memory task, no
   challenge). A four-way repeated-measures ANOVA revealed significant
   changes in EnHL for the different stance positions and for different
   movement directions (medio-lateral, anterior-posterior). These changes
   support H1 and H2. Significant differences were also found between
   rocker sole shoes and normal or barefoot standing, which supports H3.
   This study contributes to the understanding of how and why EnHL is a
   useful measure to monitor neuromuscular control of balance.}},

Abstract = {{A CMOS wide-bandwidth first-order current-mode all-pass filter (APF) is
   discussed. The circuit consists of one transistor, a resistor, a

   advantageous from an integration point of view and enables this
   configuration to be cascaded with current-mode circuits. The operation
   of the proposed circuit is experimentally validated. The APF implemented
   in IBM 0.13-mu m CMOS was measured to have the pole-zero pair located at
   8.32 GHz and to achieve a 55 ps group delay while consuming 19 mW from a
   1.5-V supply. This paper experimentally demonstrates a CMOS APF that

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The extraction of methane gas from hydrate-bearing sediments has
   garnered increasing global interest in recent years. Understanding the
   sediment response to potential production scenarios is vital for both
   accurate reservoir response simulation as well as the development of
   field extraction methodologies. Gas hydrate has an icelike structure,
   and when present within sediments it will significantly alter their
   geomechanical behavior. Of particular interest in this paper is the
   observed strain-softening response of hydrate-bearing sands during
   drained shearing. Experimental results indicate that the strain
   softening during shearing is related to deviatoric behavior. A new
   analytical strain-softening model is proposed in which a direct
   relationship between volumetric expansion and reduction in hydrate
   saturation is developed. In the proposed model, the apparent cohesion of
   hydrate-bearing sediment reduces with increasing plastic shear strain.
   To validate the model, it was implemented into a standard numerical
   code, and the results were compared with those obtained from an advanced
   hydrate-soil numerical simulator. The model is also compared with
   experimental results from drained shear tests conducted on
   hydrate-bearing sands. The deviatoric stress results of the analytical
   model and numerical simulation were found to be almost identical,
   indicating the validity of the simple analytical formulation. In
   addition, the analytical model showed good agreement with the
   experimental results. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

   and quantify the adverse effects associated with gas seeding and to
   assess various types of seed gas that could potentially be used in
   future experiments. In prior experiments, NO and NO2 were injected
   through a slot near the leading edge of a flatplate wedge model used in
   NASA Langley Research Center's 31 in. Mach 10 air tunnel facility. In
   this paper, nitric oxide, krypton, and iodine gases were simulated at
   various injection rates. Simulations showing the deflection of the
   velocity boundary layer for each of the cases are presented. Streamwise
   distributions of velocity and concentration boundary-layer thicknesses,
   as well as vertical distributions of velocity, temperature, and mass
   distributions, are presented for each of the cases. A comparison between
   simulated streamwise velocity profiles and experimentally obtained
   molecular tagging velocimetry profiles using a nitric oxide seeding
   strategy is performed to verify the influence of such a strategy on the
   boundary layer. The relative merits of the different seeding strategies

   inviscid water menisci whose statistical distributions are known,
   micro-and macro-relationships can be derived using a volume-averaging of
   stress for each one of the phases in a manner analogous to the
   derivation of Love-Weber equation defining stress in a dry granular
   medium. The main difference with respect to previous works in the
   literature lies in the homogenization technique whereby singular
   surfaces such as an air-water interface exhibiting surface tension are
   treated as an additional phase for which a so-called membrane stress is
   defined. Well-known contractile skin effects and the anisotropy of
   capillary stresses in unsaturated soils can be formally identified in
   the proposed tensorial expression that encompasses the statistics of not
   only grain contact normals, but also that of menisci spatial
   orientations and their surfaces, including water saturation. Solid
   grains are considered strictly incompressible with water being also an
   incompressible and inviscid liquid. An effective stress tensor that
   controls the strength of unsaturated granular media is hence proposed
   and verified based on discrete element modelling (DEM) numerical
   simulations of triaxial compression and simple shear tests on
   pendular-state granular soils at different confining pressures and
   matric suctions. The non-sphericity of the so-called capillary stress is
   also numerically demonstrated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{It is a great leap of humanity in abstraction and induction to represent
   the nature by a highly abstract and general concept known as systems.
   Systems are the most complicated entities and phenomena in abstract,
   physical, information, and social worlds across all science and
   engineering disciplines. A formal theory of system science is system
   algebra as an abstract mathematical structure for the formal treatment
   of general systems as well as their algebraic properties, relations,
   operations, and rules. This paper presents a denotational mathematical
   theory of system science and its applications in complex intelligent,
   knowledge, software, big data, and cognitive systems. A mathematical
   model of abstract systems is formally introduced. A set of algebraic
   operators on formal system relations, reproductions, and compositions is
   rigorously defined. System algebra provides a denotational mathematical
   means for modeling, specifying, and manipulating generic system
   structures and functions in system science, computer science, software
   science, knowledge science, and cognitive science.}},

Abstract = {{Despite surgical reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament, a
   significant number of patients will still develop post-traumatic
   osteoarthritis (PTOA). Our objective was to determine if mitigating
   aspects of the acute phase of inflammation following a defined knee
   surgery with a single administration of a glucocorticoid could prevent
   the development of PTOA-like changes within an established rabbit model
   of surgically induced PTOA. An early and late post-surgical time-point
   was investigated in this study (48h and 9 weeks post-surgery) in which
   the following groups were repeated (each n=6, for a total of 24 rabbits
   per time-point, and 48 rabbits used in the study): control (age/sex
   matched), sham (arthrotomy), drill injury (arthrotomy+two drill holes to
   a non-cartilaginous area of the femoral notch), and drill injury+single
   intra-articular (IA) injection of dexamethasone (DEX). At 48h
   post-surgery, DEX treatment significantly lowered the mRNA levels for a
   subset of pro-inflammatory mediators, and significantly lowered the
   histological grade. Nine weeks post surgery, DEX treatment significantly
   lowered the histological scores (presented as effect size) for synovium
   (3.8), lateral femoral condyle (3.9), and lateral tibial cartilage (5.1)
   samples. Thus, DEX likely acts to prevent injury induced inflammation
   that could contribute to subsequent joint damage. (c) 2015 Orthopaedic

Abstract = {{The impacts of two different groups of polymers on the mechanical and

   was styrene butadiene styrene (SBS) D1101, either crosslinked with
   sulfur or not. The theological properties of these materials were
   investigated by small-amplitude oscillations and steady-state shear
   viscosity. It was shown that the properties of a polymer modified
   asphalt blends beside depending on the type of polymer are strongly
   dependent on the presence of PPA and sulfur as it was clearly manifested
   in dynamic experiments. Steady state shear viscosity measured at 60
   degrees C showed a possible chemical interaction between Elvaloy and
   PPA. The blends with SBS D1101 (at the same temperature) showed a more
   complicated behavior. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Real gas transport through nanopores of varying cross-section type and
   shape in shale gas reservoirs}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{281}},
Pages = {{813-825}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{A model for real gas transport in nanopores of shale gas reservoirs
   (SGRs) was proposed on the basis of the weighted superposition of slip
   flow and Knudsen diffusion, where the ratios of the intermolecular
   collisions and the molecule-nanopore wall collisions to the total
   collisions are the weighted factors of slip flow and Knudsen diffusion,
   respectively. The present model takes account of slip effect and real
   gas effect, additionally, the effects of cross-section type and its
   shape of nanopores on gas transport are also considered in this paper.
   The present model is successfully validated against existing molecular
   simulation data collected from different sources in literature. The
   results show: (1) the present model is reasonable to describe all of the
   gas transport mechanisms known, including continuum flow, slip flow and
   transition flow in nanopores of SGRs; (2) the cross-section type and
   shape of nanopores both affect gas transport capacity: at the same
   cross-sectional area, gas transport capacity of nanopores with a
   circular cross section is greater than that with a rectangular cross
   section, and gas transport capacity of nanopores with a rectangular
   cross section decreases with an increasing aspect ratio; compared to the
   cross-section type, the effect of the cross-section shape on gas
   transport capacity is stronger; (3) a real gas effect improves gas
   transport capacity, which becomes more obvious with an increasing
   pressure and a decreasing pore size; (4) and compared to nanopores with
   a circular cross section, the effect of real gas effect on gas transport
   capacity of nanopores with a rectangular cross section is stronger, and
   the effect increases with an increasing aspect ratio. The proposed model
   can provide some theoretical support in numerical simulation of
   reservoir behavior in SGRs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present an analytical expression for the shear dispersion during
   transport of a neutral non-reacting chemical species within a channel
   with porous walls, which has not been addressed in previous studies,
   under the combined effects of pressure-driven and electro-osmotic flows.
   The continuity of concentrations and mass fluxes at the interface
   between the channel and the porous medium is applied to obtain the
   dispersion coefficient by considering a sufficiently low wall or zeta
   potential. The obtained dispersion coefficient is a function of the
   Debye-Huckel parameter, Poiseuille contribution fraction, and Peclet
   number. Results reveal that it is essential to include the exchange of
   chemical species between the electrolyte inside the channel and the
   porous medium. The results of this study find applications in design of
   solute transport through porous microfluidic networks and separation of
   emulsions in microchannel-membrane systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The scalability of the system is of vital importance in the design of
   social networks. This research attempts to establish a comprehensive
   framework for analysis and validation of requirements and design
   documents for software systems. In previous work, we applied this
   framework to analyze the requirements of a social network of agents with
   respect to scalability of the system. In our approach, system
   requirements were expressed using scenario-based specifications.
   Scenarios are appealing because of their expressive power and
   simplicity. Moreover, due to the clear and concise notation of
   scenarios, they can be used to analyze the system requirements for
   general validity, lack of deadlock, and existence of emergent behavior.
   In this paper a methodology is presented to formally verify that certain
   scenarios do not emerge in the system's behavior. This methodology is
   devised to indicate whether or not the new requirements of the system
   are consistent with the current requirements in place. A larger
   prototype of a social network of MSA for semantic search is utilized to
   illustrate the developed methodology.}},

Abstract = {{Analog systems have recently been used in several experiments in the
   context of convective mixing of CO2. We generalize the nonmonotonic
   density dependence of the growth of instabilities and provide a scaling
   relation for the onset of instability. The results of linear stability
   analysis and direct numerical simulations show that these fluids do not
   resemble the dynamics of CO2-water convective instabilities. A typical
   analog system, such as water-propylene glycol, is found to be less
   unstable than CO2-water. These results provide a basis for further
   research and proper selection of analog systems and are essential to the
   interpretation of experiments.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the present study was to investigate the zone-specific
   integration properties of articular cartilage defects treated in vivo
   with scaffold-free three-dimensional tissue-engineered constructs (TECs)
   derived from allogenic synovial mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in a
   porcine model. The TEC derived from the synovial MSCs was implanted into
   chondral defects in the medial femoral condyle of the knee. The
   integration boundary of repair tissue with the adjacent host cartilage
   was morphologically and biomechanically evaluated at 6 months
   post-implantation. Histological assessments showed that the repair
   tissue in each zone was well integrated with the adjacent host
   cartilage, with an apparent secure continuity of the extracellular
   matrix. There were no significant differences in histological scores
   between the integration boundary and the center of the repair tissue at
   every zone. Nonetheless, in all the specimens subjected to mechanical
   testing, failure occurred at the integration boundary. The average
   tensile strength of the integration boundary vs normal cartilage was 0.6
   vs 4.9, 3.0 vs 12.6, and 5.5 vs 12.8 MPa at the superficial, middle, and
   deep layers, respectively. Thus, these results indicate the most fragile
   point in the repair tissue remained at the integration boundary in spite
   of the apparent secure tissue continuity and equivalent histological
   quality with the center of the repair tissue. Such tissue vulnerability
   at the surface integration boundary could affect the long-term
   durability of the tissue repair, and thus, special consideration will be
   needed in the post-operative rehabilitation programming to enhance the
   longevity of such repair tissues in response to normal knee loading. (C)

   mesenchymal stem cells: a review}},
Journal = {{STEM CELL RESEARCH \& THERAPY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), also called mesenchymal stromal
   cells, have been of great interest in regenerative medicine applications
   because of not only their differentiation potential but also their
   ability to secrete bioactive factors that can modulate the immune system
   and promote tissue repair. This potential has initiated many early-phase
   clinical studies for the treatment of various diseases, disorders, and
   injuries by using either hMSCs themselves or their secreted products.
   Currently, hMSCs for clinical use are generated through conventional
   static adherent cultures in the presence of fetal bovine serum or
   human-sourced supplements. However, these methods suffer from variable
   culture conditions (i.e., ill-defined medium components and
   heterogeneous culture environment) and thus are not ideal procedures to
   meet the expected future demand of quality-assured hMSCs for human
   therapeutic use. Optimizing a bioprocess to generate hMSCs or their
   secreted products (or both) promises to improve the efficacy as well as
   safety of this stem cell therapy. In this review, current media and
   methods for hMSC culture are outlined and bioprocess development
   strategies discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents our work on developing a parallel black oil
   simulator for distributed memory computers based on our in-house
   parallel platform. The parallel simulator is designed to overcome the
   performance issues of common simulators that are implemented for
   personal computers and workstations. The finite difference method is
   applied to discretize the black oil model. In addition, some advanced
   techniques are employed to strengthen the robustness and parallel
   scalability of the simulator, including an inexact Newton method, matrix
   decoupling methods, and algebraic multigrid methods. A new multi-stage
   preconditioner is proposed to accelerate the solution of linear systems
   from the Newton methods. Numerical experiments show that our simulator
   is scalable and efficient, and is capable of simulating extremely
   large-scale black oil problems with tens of millions of grid blocks
   using thousands of MPI processes on parallel computers. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The phase equilibrium, density, and viscosity of CH4, C2H6, and CO2 with
   high n-alkane systems are of particular importance in various industrial
   processes and design. The binary interaction coefficients (k(ij)) of
   these systems for the simplified Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating
   Fluid Theory (PC-SAFF) modeling were studied systematically. A new k(ij)
   correlation on temperature and molecular weight was proposed to
   compensate the deviations as the simplified PC-SAFT averages the
   temperature- and molecular weight-dependent segment diameters of the
   original PC-SAFE The average absolute relative deviations in pressure by
   the new correlation was only 3.6\% for more than 2000 vapor-liquid
   equilibrium data, covering 49 binary systems of CH4, C2H6, and CO2 with
   n-alkanes up to n-C44H90. In addition, the prediction ability of the new
   correlation was verified by predicting the phase equilibrium and
   saturated density and viscosity of various high asymmetric systems. The

Abstract = {{Rheological properties of a new microbial polysacchride, diutan gum in
   aqueous solution have been systematically investigated. It is found that
   molecular aggregates of diutan gum can be formed at a very low
   concentration (0.12 g/L), and the mechanism of thickening by diutan gum
   is proposed. The viscosity retention rate of diutan gum changes little
   when increasing the temperature from 298 K to 348 K or in a high
   salinity solution (55.5 g L-1). Gel structure can be formed in the
   diutan gum solution, owing to the finding that the dynamic modulus has
   an exponential relationship with the concentration. The gel properties
   of diutan gum are not sensitive to temperature, and are virtually
   independent of cationic environment (Na+ and Ca2+). The temperature/salt
   tolerance of the diutan gum solution is mainly attributed to its perfect
   double helix molecular conformation, the location of the side chains of
   its molecules, and its water retention capacity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Aim of the study: The tensile properties of articular cartilage play an
   important role in the compressive behavior and integrity of the tissue.
   The stress-strain relationship of cartilage in compression was observed
   previously to depend on the strain-rate. This strain-rate dependence has
   been thought to originate mainly from fluid pressurization. However, it
   was not clear to what extent the tensile properties of cartilage
   contribute to the strain-rate dependence in compressive behavior of
   cartilage. The aim of the present study was to quantify the strain-rate
   dependent stress-strain relationship and hysteresis of articular
   cartilage in tension.Methods: Uniaxial tensile tests were performed to
   examine the strain-rate dependent non-linear tensile properties of the
   superficial zone of bovine knee cartilage. Tensile specimens were
   oriented in the fiber direction indicated by the India ink method. Seven
   strain-rates were used in the measurement ranging from 0.1 to 80\%/s,
   which corresponded to nearly static to impact joint loadings.Results:
   The experimental data showed substantial strain-rate and
   strain-magnitude dependent load response: for a given strain-magnitude,
   the tensile stress could vary by a factor of 1.95 while the modulus by a
   factor of 1.58 with strain-rate; for a given strain-rate, the modulus at
   15\% strain could be over four times the initial modulus at no strain.
   The energy loss in cartilage tension upon unloading exhibited a complex
   variation with the strain-rate.Conclusion: The strain-rate dependence of
   cartilage in tension observed from the present study is relatively
   weaker than that in compression observed previously, but is considerable
   to contribute to the strain-rate dependent load response in compression.}},

Abstract = {{A commercial supported catalyst was regenerated and reused for three
   combustion-tube tests to study the upgrading potential of Athabasca
   bitumen supplied by Japan Canada Oil Sand Ltd. (JACOS). These tests were
   part of a larger program of combustion-tube tests performed by the
   In-Situ Combustion Research Group (ISCRG) under the auspices of the
   Alberta Ingenuity Center for In-Situ Energy (AICISE). The tests were
   premixed and carried out at the same pressure of 3.45 mPa (500 psi),
   preheat temperature (95 degrees C), and ignition temperature (350
   degrees C). Test 1 used a fresh supported catalyst. Test 2 used a
   regenerated catalyst retrieved from Test 1, and Test 3 used regenerated
   catalysts (second time regeneration of catalysts from Test 1) retrieved
   from Test 2. Significant hydrodenitrogenation (HDN), 52\% for the fresh
   catalyst Test 1, 38.1\% for regenerated catalyst Test 2 and 23.8\% for
   regenerated catalyst Test 3, was obtained. The levels of
   hydrodesulfurisation (HDS) obtained were 18.1, 18.4, and 15.2\% for
   Tests 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The significant HDN and HDS removal
   coupled with decreased viscosity, increased degrees API value, and light
   hydrocarbons indicate upgrading of the original Athabasca bitumen for
   all three tests. The results showed that although the regenerated
   catalyst Tests 2 and 3 lost HDN activity compared to the fresh catalyst,
   the regenerated catalysts were still active for repeated use for in-situ
   upgrading.}},

Title = {{An Approximate Semianalytical Multiphase Forecasting Method for
   Multifractured Tight Light-Oil Wells With Complex Fracture Geometry}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CANADIAN PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{489-508}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{There is now an array of analytical, semianalytical, and empirical
   forecasting methods that can be used to history match and forecast
   multifractured horizontal wells (MFHWs) completed in low-permeability
   (tight) reservoirs. Recent developments in analytical modelling have
   extended model application to cases in which the fracture geometry
   associated with MFHWs is complex. However, analytical modelling is still
   primarily limited to single-phase-flow problems, which is very
   restrictive, and potentially inaccurate, for tight oil and liquid-rich
   gas reservoirs flowing at less than saturation pressure.
   In this work, a semianalytical method is presented for history matching
   and forecasting MFHWs with simple and complex fracture geometry
   completed in tight, black-oil reservoirs and flowing at less than the
   bubblepoint pressure. The linear-to-boundary (LTB) model, commonly used
   to model flow in the inner (stimulated) region of an MFHW, is altered to
   account for two-phase flow of oil and gas. The enhanced-fracture-region
   (EFR) case, in which both stimulated and nonstimulated regions
   contribute to flow, is approximated (empirically) by superposition of
   two modified LTB models (one representing the inner fractured region and
   the other the outer, nonstimulated region), and similarly altered to
   account for two-phase flow. An important observation is that, for MFHWs
   flowing at less than bubblepoint at constant flowing bottomhole pressure
   during transient linear flow, the slope of the square-root-of-time plot
   for both oil and gas phases is constant {[}i.e., gas/oil ratio (GOR) is
   constant]. The slope and intercept of the square-root-of-time plot for
   the primary phase (e.g., oil in the cases studied) can therefore be used
   to generate a forecast during the transient linear-flow period for oil
   and for gas (by assuming constant GOR). For boundary-dominated flow, a
   robust method for forecasting gas and oil was developed using material
   balance for both phases combined with a modified productivity-index
   equation that accounts for multiphase flow. A fully implicit approach
   has been used to solve the flow equations for oil and gas.
   The new modified LTB and EFR models simplify forecasting considerably
   for low-permeability black-oil reservoirs exhibiting multiphase flow
   behaviour, relative to numerical simulation, although they are not as
   rigorous. The new models can, however, be tied directly to the results
   of rate-transient analysis and are flexible enough to be applied to
   common conceptual models used in the literature for forecasting MFHWs
   under certain conditions.
   The new modified LTB model has been compared with both simulated and
   field examples. The initial results demonstrate that transient-and
   boundary-dominated-flow periods for oil and gas are reasonably matched
   with the new approach, although slight mismatches may occur,
   particularly during early boundary-dominated flow. The limits of the new
   forecasting method will continue to be explored in future work.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term transient linear flow of hydraulically fractured vertical and
   horizontal wells completed in tight/shale gas wells has historically
   been analyzed by use of the square-root-of-time plot. Pseudovariables
   are typically used for compressible fluids to account for
   pressure-dependence of fluid properties. Recently, a corrected
   pseudotime has been introduced for this purpose, in which the average
   pressure in the distance of investigation (DOI) is calculated with an
   appropriate material-balance equation. The DOI calculation is therefore
   a key component in the determination of the linear-flow parameter
   (product of fracture half-length and square root of permeability,
   x(f)root k) and the calculation of contacted fluid in place. Until now,
   the DOI for transient linear flow has been determined empirically, and
   may not be accurate for all combinations of fluid properties and
   operating conditions.
   In this work, we have derived the DOI equations analytically for
   transient linear flow under constant-flowing-pressure and -rate
   conditions. For the first time, rigorous methodologies have been used
   for this purpose. Two different approaches were used: the maximum rate
   of pressure response (impulse concept) and the
   transient/boundary-dominated flow intersection method. The two
   approaches resulted in constants in the DOI equation that are much
   different from previously derived versions for the
   constant-flowing-pressure case. The accuracy of the new equations was
   tested by analyzing synthetic production data from a series of fine-grid
   numerical simulations. Single-phase oil and gas cases were analyzed;
   pseudovariable alteration for pressure-dependent porosity and
   permeability was required in the analysis.
   The calculated linear-flow parameters, determined from our new DOI
   formulations for the constant-flowing-bottomhole-pressure (FBHP) case,
   and the input values to numerical simulation, are in good agreement. Of
   the two new DOI-calculation methods provided, the maximum rate of
   pressure response (unit impulse method) provides more accurate results.
   Finally, a field case was analyzed to determine the impact of DOI
   formulations on derivations of the linear-flow parameter from field
   data.
   Linear-flow analysis on the basis of the DOI calculations presented in
   this work is significantly improved over previous formulations for
   constant FBHP.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional monitoring methods, such as surveying and tiltmeter,
   require labor-intensive and time-consuming fieldwork, and they are
   limited to specific locations, either survey stations or an array of
   tiltmeters. Furthermore, none of the studies about the geomechanical
   inversion of cumulative surface deformations for the inference of
   subsurface volumetric changes in Canadian oil sands has yet been
   published. Radar interferometry has been widely used formonitoring
   surface deformations over a large area in all weather conditions with
   high accuracy. We have developed a method to detect surface deformations
   by radar interferometry techniques and to estimate subsurface volumetric
   changes by geomechanical inversion of surface deformation measurements.
   Differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar was implemented
   using first advanced land observation satellite phased array type L-band
   synthetic aperture radar data; the resulting interferograms indicated
   the vertical surface deformations between July 2007 and March 2011. An
   additional investigation into the detected surface deformations was
   performed to retrieve time-series maps of cumulative surface
   deformations, which accounted for the temporal evolution of the changes
   in surface elevation. The temporal analysis confirmed that the ground
   surface experienced nonlinear time-varying vertical deformations,
   reaching up to -33 and +72 cm for a 3.7 year time period starting in
   July 2007. The surface deformations were interpreted using cubic
   polynomial regression with historical information on fluid injection and
   withdrawal. The positive curvilinear relationships between the fluid
   volume changes, which were caused by steam injection and bitumen/water
   production, and the surface deformations, were found with an R-2 of
   greater than 0.73. The fractional volumetric changes in the reservoir
   were examined by applying geomechanical inversion to surface deformation
   measurements. The fractional volumetric changes ranged from -1.8\% to
   +3.9\% with respect to the initial reservoir volume for the 3.7 year
   period. A positive linear relationship between fluid volume changes and
   subsurface volumetric changes was determined with R-2 ranging from 0.515
   to 0.992.}},

   better detects ON damage than mean FA.
   METHODS. The ON patients (n = 24) underwent DTI within 1 month of
   symptoms and then 6 months later (n = 21). Twelve control subjects
   participated in one session. Mean FA and axial (AD), radial (RD), and
   mean (MD) diffusivities were compared between ON and fellow eyes,
   control eyes, and sessions. Values were sorted into bins, and
   coefficients of skewness of FA, AD, RD, and MD were compared between ON
   and fellow eyes, control eyes, and sessions.
   RESULTS. Mean AD, RD, and MD of ON eyes were significantly reduced
   compared with fellow eyes (P < 0.04) within 1 month of symptoms, but did
   not differ at 6 months. Mean AD and RD of ON eyes were significantly
   lower than control eyes (P < 0.05). No differences were observed for
   mean FA. The coefficient of skewness of FA was significantly different
   between ON eyes and fellow eyes (P = 0.03) and control eyes (P = 0.04)
   within 1 month of symptoms, but did not differ at 6 months. No
   differences were observed for AD, RD, and MD.
   CONCLUSIONS. Skewness of FA can detect white matter damage associated
   with ON and its recovery, which may further inform us of how DTI can
   measure white matter injury and repair.}},

Abstract = {{Permeability is one of the most important parameters for characterizing
   fluid flow and production from reservoirs. In this paper, a modified
   pressure-pulse decay (PPD) method is proposed and tested for
   permeability measurement of tight cores. For this modified method, only
   one gas chamber is applied at one end of the test core sample, while the
   other end of the core is sealed. A small pressure pulse is applied to
   the gas chamber, and the pressure change in it is monitored with time.
   The mathematical model based on the experimental design has been built,
   and a general solution has been obtained by considering gas diffusion
   from the gas chamber to the core, under the pressure difference.
   Early-time and late-time solutions for the model are also presented for
   convenient application for post processing of experimental data.
   Simultaneously, experiments based on the modified model and on the
   traditional PPD model are carefully conducted to compare their results.
   The measured permeabilities of a core plug under different fluid
   pressure conditions, using the modified method, are in good agreement
   with those from the traditional PPD method. The advantages of the
   modified PPD method mainly lie in two points: one is that the results
   are much more accurate than that from the traditional PPD method when
   error exists in the measurement of chamber volume or pore volume. This
   advantage is especially significant for tight cores because their pore
   volume is usually hard to measure accurately. The other is that this
   modified method needs less transducers, a simpler experimental apparatus
   and easier operation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The NMR relaxometry measurements are designed and applied to determine
   the initial gas saturation in tight gas formations. After a
   full-diameter core obtained by sealed coring technique has been cut into
   two sections, one is weighed and then put into the NMR apparatus to
   measure its NMR T-2 spectrum, while the other is used to obtain a core
   plug, and some clastic grains from its edge and center. Afterward these
   grains are weighed and their NMR T-2 spectra are measured. Subsequently,
   the full-diameter section, grains, and the core plug are dried with
   their weights measured. Then they are saturated with water to measure
   their weights and NMR T-2 spectra. It is found that the average initial
   gas saturations for three cores determined by weighting method are
   41.87\%, 38.59\%, and 31.30\%, respectively. From T-2 spectra at the
   initial state and saturated-water state, the average initial gas
   saturations for these cores could be reproduced with a relative error of
   0.29\%, 1.37\%, and 0.40\%, respectively. If the cores are invaded by
   drilling fluid or not transported or preserved well, the initial gas
   saturations still could be determined by NMR T-2 spectra of the cores at

Abstract = {{This paper provides an overview of various variable speed limit (VSL)
   strategies developed over the last two decades. It first explains the
   theoretical background of VSL systems and how they can be used as
   dynamic traffic control devices to improve traffic conditions and
   increase safety. An overview of VSL control strategies, ranging from
   early rule-based approaches to the most advanced network-wide
   coordinated approach, is provided, followed by a discussion of their
   associated potential benefits and areas for improvement. The likely
   environmental benefits of VSL strategies are also discussed, along with
   some further related aspects of VSL application, such as driver
   compliance to VSL and the integration of a differential speed limit
   (DSL) with VSL. Finally, the paper presents a critical review, pointing
   out some key issues that were identified from the literature review and
   recommends some directions for future research that need to be addressed
   as recommendations for best practices to underpin further refinement,
   development, and application of VSL.}},

   three-dimensional (3-D) data acquisition surfaces are investigated: 1)
   cylindrical, 2) hemispherical, and 3) patient specific. Three 3-D
   numerical breast models are used for the study. A realistic
   ultra-wideband (UWB) antenna generates incident fields and records the
   total fields. The responses from targets are analyzed, and object
   coverage is evaluated in terms of range distances, cross-range
   distances, and cumulative radiated power directed into the object by the
   antenna array embedded in the acquisition surface. Images are formed to
   verify these observations. We demonstrate that a patient-specific
   acquisition surface provides greater responses from targets, superior
   object coverage and improved images compared to the other acquisition
   surfaces studied.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{System identification can be carried out by perturbing the system
   input(s) and processing the recorded input (s) and output(s) of the
   system. In synchronous generators, if the governor is not in action, one
   of the inputs (the mechanical torque) is not available for measurement,
   and the experiments cannot be carried out. In the published literature,
   the input perturbation is mostly carried out through the excitation
   system, and the mechanical torque is assumed to be constant during the
   experiment. This would affect the accuracy of the results. In this
   paper, various multivariable closed-loop identification methods (direct
   and indirect and linear and nonlinear) are used to obtain an accurate
   and comprehensive model for the synchronous generator. To simplify model
   structure, the orthogonal least squares with D-optimality method is used
   to remove unnecessary terms. A comparison of the performance of various
   techniques shows that closed-loop nonlinear identification using
   nonlinear auto regressive with exogenous input polynomials is very
   effective, and a simple nonlinear model for the synchronous generator
   can be identified successfully using multivariable closed-loop input and

   dorsal skin: gallic acid-isoflavone - covered AuNPs (GI-AuNPs) and
   protocatechuic acid-isoflavone - covered AuNPs (PI-AuNPs). From the
   biological activity monitoring, it has been resulted that 5-fold thicker

   3-fold higher superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were obtained in the
   Phyto-AuNP-treated group, compared with a vehicle group (deionized water

   surgical and burn damaged Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats induced higher
   expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and
   angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2). It would be plausible that antioxidant property

Abstract = {{Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients commonly experience neuromuscular
   adaptations that may affect stair climbing competence. This study
   identified multimuscle pattern (MMP) changes in postoperative female TKA
   patients during stair climbing with a support vector machine (SVM). It
   was hypothesized that TKA patients adopt temporal and spectral muscle
   activation characteristics indicative of muscle atrophy and
   cocontraction strategies. Nineteen female subjects {[}10 unilateral
   sex-specific TKAs, 62.2 +/- 8.6 yr, body mass index (BMI) 28.2 +/- 5.4
   kg/m(2); 9 healthy control subjects, 61.4 +/- 7.4 yr, BMI 25.6 +/- 2.4
   kg/m(2)] were recruited. Surface electromyograms (EMGs) were obtained
   for seven lower limb muscles of the affected limb of TKA subjects and a
   randomly assigned limb for control subjects during stair climbing.
   Stance phase (+/- 30\%) EMG data were wavelet transformed and normalized
   to total power. Data across all muscles were combined to form MMPs and
   analyzed with a SVM. Statistical analysis was performed with binomial
   tests, independent group t-tests, or independent group Mann-Whitney
   U-tests in SPSS (P < 0.05). SVM results indicated significantly altered
   muscle activation patterns in the TKA group for biceps femoris
   (recognition rate 84.2\%), semitendinosus (recognition rate 73.7\%),
   gastrocnemius (recognition rate 68.4\%), and tibialis anterior
   (recognition rate 68.4\%). Further analysis identified no significant
   differences in spectral activation characteristics between groups.
   Temporal adaptations, indicative of cocontraction strategies, were,
   however, evident in TKA MMPs. This approach may provide a valuable tool
   for clinical neuromuscular function assessment and rehabilitation
   monitoring.}},

   various applications, and in particular for bioimpedance measurements.
   In this paper, a new method to extract the single-dispersion Cole

   consisting of a operational amplifier and a set of resistors. We examine
   the theory behind this magnitude-only method and demonstrate its

Abstract = {{The Grosmont Formation in Alberta, Canada is a highly fractured,
   karstified and vuggy bitumen-rich carbonate reservoir located west of
   and below the Athabasca oil sands deposit. The bitumen carbonate
   platform extends about 500 km in length and up to 150 km in width and
   contains an estimated 64.5 billion m(3) (406.5 billion barrels) of oil.
   The Grosmont Formation is larger than the combined total of all other
   known carbonate bitumen deposits in the world. Here, we analyze early
   Grosmont steam pilots to improve the design offuture pilots and
   commercial development of this massive bitumen deposit. In agreement
   with the conclusions of earlier analysis of these Grosmont pilots, they
   were reasonably successful considering the heterogeneous nature of the
   Grosmont Formation. Operational factors such as poor steam quality,
   non-optimized high injection pressures and completion issues appear to
   have heavily impacted recovery performances. Clearly, steam-based
   recovery operations have good potential for Grosmont, especially
   considering that it is mature commercial technology. Following an
   integrated analysis of early Grosmont pilots, we posit that Cyclic Steam
   Stimulation (CSS) using horizontal wells exhibits greater potential for
   the development of Grosmont carbonate, compared with Steam-Assisted
   Gravity Drainage technology (SAGD).}},

Abstract = {{The reliability of power delivery can be profoundly improved by
   preventing wildlife-related power outages. This can be achieved by
   insulating electrical substation components with non-conductive covers.
   The manufacture of custom-built covers requires as-built models of the

   recognize key components of electrical substations from 3D LiDAR data
   acquired using terrestrial laser scanning. The proposed methodology
   includes six novel algorithms to recognize key components (fence,
   cables, circuit breakers, bushings and bus pipes) of electrical
   substations. Three datasets with different resolutions and
   configurations are used in this study. A Leica HDS 6100 laser scanner
   was used to acquire the first dataset and a Faro Focus(3D) laser scanner
   was employed to collect the second and third datasets. The obtained
   results indicate that 178 and 171 out of 181 electrical substation
   elements were successfully recognized in the first and second dataset,

Abstract = {{Objective: The primary objective of this study was to quantify the
   strains applied to the internal carotid artery (ICA) during neck spinal
   manipulative treatments and range of motion (ROM)/diagnostic testing of
   the head and neck.
   Methods: Strains of the ICA (n = 12) were measured in 6 fresh,
   unembalmed cadaveric specimens using sonomicrometry. Peak and average
   strains of the ICA obtained during cervical spinal manipulations given
   by experienced doctors of chiropractic were compared with the
   corresponding strains obtained during ROM and diagnostic testing of the
   head and neck.
   Results: Peak and average strains of the ICA for cervical spinal
   manipulative treatments were significantly smaller (P < .001) than the
   corresponding strains obtained for the ROM and diagnostic testing. All
   strains during ROM and treatment testing were dramatically smaller than
   the initial failure strains of the ICA.
   Conclusions: This study showed that maximal ICA strains imparted by
   cervical spinal manipulative treatments were well within the normal ROM.
   Chiropractic manipulation of the neck did not cause strains to the ICA
   in excess of those experienced during normal everyday movements.
   Therefore, cervical spinal manipulative therapy as performed by the
   trained clinicians in this study, did not appear to place undue strain
   on the ICA and thus does not seem to be a factor in ICA injuries.}},

Abstract = {{Peripheral nerve regrowth is less robust than commonly assumed,
   particularly when it accompanies common clinical scenarios such as
   diabetes mellitus. Brief extracellular electrical stimulation (ES)
   facilitates the regeneration of peripheral nerves in part through early
   activation of the conditioning injury response and BDNF. Here, we
   explored intrinsic neuronal responses to ES to identify whether ES might
   impact experimental diabetes, where regeneration is attenuated. ES
   altered several regeneration related molecules including rises in
   tubulin, Shh (Sonic hedgehog) and GAP43 mRNAs. ES was associated with
   rises in neuronal intracellular calcium but its strict linkage to
   regrowth was not confirmed. In contrast, we identified PI3K-PTEN
   involvement, an association previously linked to diabetic regenerative
   impairment. Following ES there were declines in PTEN protein and mRNA
   both in vitro and in vivo and a PI3K inhibitor blocked its action. In
   vitro, isolated diabetic neurons were capable of mounting robust
   responsiveness to ES. In vivo, ES improved electrophysiological and
   behavioral indices of nerve regrowth in a chronic diabetic model of mice
   with pre-existing neuropathy. Regrowth of myelinated axons and
   reinnervation of the epidermis were greater following ES than sham
   stimulation. Taken together, these findings identify a role for ES in
   supporting regeneration during the challenges of diabetes mellitus. (C)

Journal = {{SPE RESERVOIR EVALUATION \& ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{523-533}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Pressure-transient analysis in dual-porosity media is commonly studied
   by assuming a constant reservoir permeability. Such an assumption can
   result in significant errors when estimating pressure behavior and
   production rate of naturally fractured reservoirs as fracture
   permeability decreases during the production. At present, there is still
   a lack of analytical pressure-transient studies in naturally fractured
   reservoirs while taking stress-sensitive fracture permeability into
   account.
   In this study, an approximate analytical model is proposed to
   investigate the pressure behavior and production rate in the naturally
   fractured reservoirs. This model assumes that fracture permeability is a
   function of both permeability modulus and pressure difference. The
   pressure-dependent fracture system is coupled with matrix system with an
   unsteady-state exchange flow rate. A nonlinear diffusivity equation in
   fracture system is developed and solved by Pedrosa's transformation and
   a perturbation technique with zero-order approximation. A total of six
   solutions in the Laplace space are presented for two inner-boundary
   conditions and three outer-boundary conditions. Finally, pressure
   behavior and production rate are studied for both infinite and finite
   reservoirs.
   Pressure behavior and production rate from the models with and without
   stress-sensitive permeability are compared. It is found that, for an
   infinite reservoir with a constant-flow-rate boundary condition, if
   permeability modulus is 0.1, dimensionless pressure difference at the
   well bottom from the model with fracture-permeability sensitivity is
   80\% higher than that of the constant fracture-permeability model at a
   dimensionless time of 10(6). Such difference can be as high as 216\% if
   permeability modulus increases to 0.15. On the contrary, for the
   infinite reservoirs with a constant-pressure boundary, the constant
   fracture-permeability model tends to overestimate the flow rate at
   wellbore and cumulative production. The proposed model not only provides
   an analytical and quantitative method to investigate the effects of
   fracture-permeability sensitivity on reservoir-pressure distribution and
   production, but it also can be applied to build up analysis of well test
   data from stress-sensitive formations.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in the characteristics of retinal vessels such as width and
   tortuosity can be signs of the presence of several diseases such
   retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and diabetic retinopathy. Plus disease
   is an indicator of ROP which requires treatment and is signified by an
   increase in posterior venular width. In this work, we present image
   processing techniques for the detection, segmentation, tracking, and
   measurement of the width of the major temporal arcade (MTA), which is
   the thickest venular branch in the retina. Several image processing
   techniques have been employed, including the use of Gabor filters to
   detect the MTA, morphological image processing to obtain its skeleton,
   Canny's method to detect and select MTA vessel-edge candidates,
   least-squares fitting to interpolate the MTA edges, and geometrical
   procedures to measure the width of the MTA. The results, obtained using
   110 retinal ftindus images of preterm infants, indicate a statistically
   highly significant difference in MTA width of normal cases as compared
   to cases with plus disease (p < 0.01). The results provide good accuracy
   in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of plus disease with an area under the
   receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.76. The proposed methods
   may be used in CAD of plus disease and timely treatment of ROP in a
   clinical or teleophthalmological setting. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Potassium-catalyzed steam gasification experiments of ash-free,coal were
   conducted in a drop-down reactor to Study the influence of the catalyst
   loading, temperature, H2O/H-2 ratio, and heating protocol. The higher
   the catalyst loading, the faster the,carbon conversion; however, at an
   initial K/C ratio of 0.1, a saturation effect (decrease in reactivity
   per potassium atom) was observed. At higher gasification temperatures,
   this saturation, effect was more pronounced and likely caused by
   increased potassium mobility. The catalyst accelerated predominately the
   oxygen transfer reactions and not the methane formation. Methane is
   produced Via direct hydrogenation of the carbon surface. The selectivity
   to methane and carbon monoxide was increased by reducing the H2O/H-2
   ratio, which would represent conditions in a gasifier away from the gas
   inlet. Lastly, the heating protocol influenced mainly the initial rate
   of gasification, up to 20\% carbon conversion beyond that, the rates
   were similar.}},

Abstract = {{The inherent CO2 gasification reactivities of chars derived from a
   series of plentiful carbon sources, including petroleum coke (petcoke),
   coal with various ranks, biomass, and even municipal solid wastes, have
   been systematically investigated in this work. Among these, switchgrass
   char exhibits the best activity, while petcoke char behaves the worst
   toward CO production. The results from sample characterizations indicate
   that the inherent char reactivity during CO2 gasification is closely
   related to its physical properties such as the alkali metal and oxygen
   contents as well as the H/C atomic ratio. In addition, the effect of the
   reaction conditions (i.e., temperature, pressure, space velocity,
   particle size of char, and CO and CO2 concentrations in the gas
   feedstock) on char CO2 gasification has also been explored. Moreover, a
   set of supported catalysts have been developed to further promote the
   char reactivity toward CO2 gasification at moderate temperature, among
   which KCa/ZnOCeO2 ranks at the top in terms of CO2 conversion and CO
   production and demonstrates excellent stability during a long-term
   cumulative run. Through careful analyses of the collected catalyst
   characterization results, a novel catalyst design composed of two redox
   metal/metal oxide pairs supported on an oxygen ion conductor, based on
   the reported KCa/ZnOCeO2 system, has been proposed for future catalyst
   development with even better CO2 gasification performance for fluidized
   bed applications with much easier catalyst recovery and thus minimized
   catalyst loss.}},

Title = {{Investigation of initial water mobility and its effects on SAGD

Abstract = {{Steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) has become a preferred in-situ
   recovery technology for oil sands and bitumen deposits in Canada. In
   some production history matching studies, the initial water was found to
   be mobile in SGAD projects, which could cause high steam loss, difficult
   pressure control, high steam oil ratio (SOR), etc. It is crucial to
   determine the initial water mobility in order to optimize SAGD
   performance. In this paper, a novel method is presented to effectively
   determine the mobility of initial water existing as the continuous
   wetting phase in the bitumen reservoirs. More specifically, wax was used
   as the oil phase, for the first time, to simulate the immobile oil phase
   in bitumen reservoirs and oil sands. Experimental results indicated that
   the interstitial water could still flow when the water saturation was as
   low as 5\% in the simulated bitumen-water system. A triangular tube
   bundle model was constructed and tuned to match the experimental
   results. The model was used to simulate the water relative permeability
   curves at different initial water saturations. A correlation of the
   initial water mobility with the initial water saturations was developed
   through data analysis. The impact of initial water movement on SAGD
   operations was illustrated using an analytical approach, and the
   associated energy loss was calculated. The results showed that the
   initial water mobility can lead to severe energy loss. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{The distribution of bone mass in the lumbar vertebrae: are we measuring

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The ideal target of bone mineral density (BMD)
   measurements of the spine is the trabecula-rich vertebral body. Yet,
   spine BMD measurements routinely obtained with dual-energy X-ray
   absorptiometry also include the posterior elements of the vertebra,
   which are mainly cortical bone and insensitive to bone loss.
   PURPOSE: We compared the bone mass of the vertebral body and posterior
   elements to determine the contributions of vertebral components to
   vertebral BMD measurements.
   STUDY DESIGN: A micro-computed tomography study of lumbar vertebral
   bone.
   METHODS: From a spine archive, 144 cadaveric lumbar vertebrae (L1-L5)
   from 48 male human spines (mean age, 50 years) were scanned in air using
   micro-computed tomography to measure bone volume, bone mineral content
   (BMC) and BMD of the vertebral body, posterior elements, and entire
   vertebra. The contributions of the vertebral components to the total
   vertebral BMC and volume were compared, and the correlations between the
   BMC and BMD of the vertebrae and their components were examined.
   RESULTS: Overall, the vertebral body contributed about one-third of the
   total vertebral BMC and two-thirds of the total vertebral volume, and
   the posterior elements contributed the remainder. The vertebral body BMC
   and BMD were poorly correlated to those of the posterior elements
   (r=0.39 for BMC and r=0.34 for BMD, p<.0001) and moderately correlated
   to the whole vertebra (r=0.77 and 0.75, respectively, p<.0001). The BMC
   and BMD of the posterior elements and whole vertebra were more strongly
   correlated (r=0.89 and 0.84, respectively, p<.0001).
   CONCLUSIONS: The posterior elements are the primary contributor to
   vertebral BMC and BMD measurements. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry
   spine BMD measurements are likely to be more representative of the
   posterior elements than the targeted vertebral body. The findings
   elucidate the extent of the limitation of dual-energy X-ray
   absorptiometry spine BMD measurements. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The issue of adaptability in the design of automated visual inspection
   (AVI) systems has been a major road block in the application of AVI
   technology to manufacturing industry. The objective of an adaptable AVI
   system is to reduce system tuning time while maintaining the quality of
   inspection. In the authors' previous work (Int J Adv Manuf Technol
   59:655-667, 2012), we have proposed a novel adaptable AVI scheme, with
   which an AVI system can be trained online to accommodate new patterns.
   As such, the system can be deployed to undertake new inspection tasks or
   adapt to new operation conditions without excessive offline training
   efforts. The research presented in this two-part article is our further
   development of the adaptable AVI scheme, namely A(2)VIS. In this
   research, we focus on elaborating the concept, designing the structure,
   implementing the functions, and evaluating the performance of A(2)VIS in
   a systemic perspective. In part I, the proposed A(2)VIS is presented as
   a generic scheme at the conceptual level, with respect to the system
   components and structure, operating procedure, and performance measures.
   The key element in the design of the A(2)VIS is an adaptable inspection
   model that integrates subject localization, feature extraction, and
   classification functions as trainable submodels. In part I of this
   paper, we developed a generic tool for an adaptable AVI system without
   specifying the use of particular machine vision and machine learning
   techniques. Interested readers may choose techniques for implementing
   the proposed scheme according to their own preferences. In part II of
   this article, we focus on the system implementation and evaluation of
   A(2)VIS using such techniques as template matching, principal component
   analysis (PCA), and support vector machine (SVM).}},

Abstract = {{This paper is the second part of a two-part article, which presents an
   adaptable automated visual inspection scheme (A(2)VIS) and its

   efficient edge-based template matching method is developed to allow
   tolerance against image distortion due to rotation and changes in size
   and position. Upon identifying the region of interest (ROI), image
   features are extracted through principal component analysis (PCA). Based
   on the extracted features, support vector machine (SVM) technique is
   employed to construct a reliable classification model. During model
   adaptation phase, online learning is used to build both the feature
   model and classification model for the purpose of performing inspection
   during the system training period. In the system evaluation with respect
   to the system efficiency and inspection accuracy, data collected from an
   automobile parts assembly inspection cell are used to assist system
   implementation and verify the fulfillment of design goals.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical expression is derived for the shear dispersion during
   transport of a neutral nonreacting solute within a coupled system
   comprised of a capillary tube and a porous medium under the combined
   effects of pressure-driven and electro-osmotic flows. We use the
   Reynolds decomposition technique to obtain a dispersion coefficient by
   considering a sufficiently low wall or zeta potential that accounts for
   the combined flows. The coupled dispersion coefficient depends on the
   Debye-Huckel parameter, Poiseuille contribution fraction, and Peclet
   number. The developed model also provides a shear dispersion coefficient
   for an impervious capillary tube (noncoupled system). The ratio of the
   coupled (porous wall) and noncoupled (impervious) dispersion
   coefficients reveals that it is essential to include the transport of
   chemical species from the tube to the porous medium in several important
   physical situations. These findings have implications for design of
   chemical species transport in porous microfluidic networks and
   separation of emulsions in microchannel-membrane systems. (c) 2015

Title = {{A systematic literature review of the effect of carotid atherosclerosis

Journal = {{ATHEROSCLEROSIS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{243}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{211-222}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objective: This systematic literature review sought to determine the
   effects of carotid atherosclerotic plaque on local arterial stiffness.
   Methods: MedLine, EMBASE, and grey literature were searched with the
   following term: ({''}atherosclerosis{''} or ``carotid
   atherosclerosis{''} or ``carotid artery disease{''} or ``carotid
   plaque{''}) AND ({''}distensibility{''} or ``elasticity{''} or
   ``stiffness{''} or ``compliance{''}) NOT ({''}pulse wave velocity{''} or
   ``PWV{''} or ``carotid-ankle{''} or ``ankle-brachial{''} or
   ``augmentation index{''} or ``cardio-ankle{''} or ``CAVI{''} or ``flow
   mediated dilation{''} or ``FMD{''}).
   Results were restricted to English language articles reporting local
   arterial stiffness in human subjects with carotid atherosclerosis.
   Results: Of the 1466 search results, 1085 abstracts were screened and
   191 full-text articles were reviewed for relevance. The results of the
   50 studies that assessed some measure of carotid arterial elasticity or
   stiffness in patients with carotid plaque were synthesized and reviewed.
   Discussion: A number of different measures of carotid elasticity were
   found in the literature. Regardless of which metric was used, the
   majority of studies found increased carotid stiffness ( or decreased
   distensibility) to be associated with carotid plaque presence, the
   degree of atherosclerosis, and incident stroke.
   Conclusion: Carotid artery mechanics are influenced by the presence of
   atherosclerotic plaque. The clinical applicability of carotid elasticity
   measures may be limited by the lack of reference values and standardized
   techniques. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{169}},
Pages = {{31-43}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We study the pricing problem for a third-party-logistics (3PL) provider
   that provides ware-housing and transportation services. When customers
   arrive at the 3PL provider, they specify the delivery dates for their
   freight, and before the specified delivery dates, their freight is
   stocked in the 3PL provider's warehouse. We propose a dynamic pricing
   strategy (DPS) and develop a stochastic-nonlinear-programming (SNLP)
   model which computes the optimal freight rates for different delivery
   dates incorporating the 3PL provider's current holding cost and
   available transportation capacity for each route. As customers are
   heterogeneous in their valuations and price sensitivities for delivery
   dates, and the distributions of the customers' delivery date preferences
   are unknown to the 3PL provider, we modify the standard multinomial
   logit (MNL) function to predict customer choices. Through a simulation
   experiment, we show that the proposed MNL function can be a good
   replacement for the mixed MNL function when the mixed MNL function is
   not applicable. Through simulation we also compare the proposed DPS with
   a static pricing strategy. We show that with our DPS both the 3PL
   provider and its customers are better off, and the 3PL provider has
   different investment incentives for increasing transportation capacity.
   Our results can be also applied in similar settings that feature holding
   costs, limited production capacity and delivery-date-sensitive
   customers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Optimization of overlapping activities in the design phase of
   construction projects}},
Journal = {{AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{81-95}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A well-known practice to accelerate construction projects is to overlap
   the design phase activities. For a typical construction project, a
   number of overlapping strategies exist during the design phase which all
   can result in timesaving. However, the cost of these strategies varies
   significantly depending on the total rework and complexity they
   generate. A favorable overlapping strategy is one that generates the
   required timesaving at the minimum cost. To find such a strategy, the
   question ``Which activities have to be overlapped and to what extent to
   reduce the project duration at the minimum cost?{''} should be answered.
   This research aimed at answering the question through generating an
   overlapping optimization algorithm. The algorithm works based on the
   principles of genetic algorithms (GAs). The algorithm explained in the
   paper is unique compared to previous algorithms and frameworks available
   in the literature, as it can optimize multi-path networks and can handle
   all types of activity dependencies (i.e. finish-to-start,
   start-to-start, and finish-to-finish). It also takes both critical and
   non-critical activities into account and follows the critical path if
   the critical path changes or new critical paths emerge. A computer tool
   was also developed to run, examine and validate the overlapping
   optimization algorithm. This paper introduces the algorithm and the
   computer tool in detail and explains the results of their validation
   through optimizing a real-world project schedule. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Magnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles exhibit high efficiency in wastewater
   treatment for many important reasons, including that they can remove
   contaminants from wastewater rapidly owing to their high external
   surface area/unit mass and interstice reactivity. Additionally, this
   type of iron oxide can easily be separated using a magnet after
   finishing the treatment process, can be used as a catalyst for the
   decomposition of adsorbed contaminants and thus reduce sludge formation,
   and can cost-effectively meet the environmental regulations for
   wastewater treatment since it can be prepared in situ where treatment is
   needed via various techniques. In this study, we use magnetic iron oxide
   nanoparticles for dye removal from synthetic and real textile wastewater
   for the first time. The effects of different experimental parameters on
   dye removal, such as contact time, initial concentration, solution pH,
   and coexisting ions, were investigated. Computational modelling of the
   interaction of different dye molecules with different surfaces of -Fe2O3
   nanoparticles is performed to obtain more mechanistic insights on the
   adsorption behaviour. The results showed that dye adsorption was fast,
   as external adsorption was dominated. The adsorption equilibrium data
   fit very closely to the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model, confirming
   monolayer adsorption, which is supported by the adsorption computational
   calculations. The adsorption was spontaneous, endothermic, and physical
   in nature.}},

Abstract = {{Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of chronic joint pain in the
   older human population. Diagnosis of OA at an earlier stage may enable
   the development of new treatments to one day effectively modify the
   progression and prognosis of the disease. In this work, we explore
   whether an integrated metabolomics approach could be utilized for the
   diagnosis of OA. Synovial fluid (SF) samples were collected from
   symptomatic chronic knee OA patients and normal human cadaveric knee
   joints. The samples were analyzed using H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance
   (NMR) spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)
   followed by multivariate statistical analysis. Based on the metabolic
   profiles, we were able to distinguish OA patients from the controls and
   validate the statistical models. Moreover, we have integrated the H-1
   NMR and GC-MS results and we found that 11 metabolites were
   statistically important for the separation between OA and normal SF.
   Additionally, statistical analysis showed an excellent predictive
   ability of the constructed metabolomics model (area under the receiver
   operating characteristic curve=1.0). Our findings indicate that
   metabolomics might serve as a promising approach for the diagnosis and
   prognosis of degenerative changes in the knee joint and should be
   further validated in clinical settings. (c) 2015 Orthopaedic Research

Abstract = {{In this study, directional friction effects by creating asymmetrically

   Inclined micro-milling forces were modeled, and subsequent comparisons

   also showed that the flat end mill used to produce these dimpled
   surfaces was not symmetric. Tribological characterization of the
   friction properties of the surface using reciprocating tribometer and a
   hemispherical ruby counter surface indicated that these asymmetrically
   shaped dimples lowered the overall friction coefficients measured under
   both dry and lubricated sliding conditions. Moreover, the results also
   demonstrated a sliding direction dependent response, in terms of the
   measured friction coefficients. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Enhanced heavy oil recovery in thin reservoirs using foamy oil-assisted
   methane huff-n-puff method}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{159}},
Pages = {{962-973}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{A considerable portion of heavy oil resides in thin formations. In such
   reservoir environments, thermal recovery methods tend to be neither
   effective nor economical, due to significant heat loss and water
   resource requirements. The methane huff-n-puff process for enhancing
   heavy oil recovery in thin formations is an alternative that has the
   advantages of availability of resources and economic efficiency.
   However, the principal problem with such a process is the high mobility
   of the gas phase, relative to the oil phase, during the production
   cycle. In order to overcome this limitation, this paper presents a new
   enhanced methane injection technique, called the foamy oil-assisted
   methane huff-n-puff method (FOAM H-n-P). In this process, an oil-soluble
   foaming agent and methane are injected in a cyclic manner, but in two
   separate slugs. The methane provides the solution gas drive energy, and
   the presence of the foaming agent promotes the formation of an in situ
   foamy oil by trapping the released gas, which significantly enhances the
   effectiveness of the solution gas drive mechanism. A new experimental
   procedure was developed to prove that the selected foaming agent has an
   effective foaminess in conventional heavy oil, and to investigate,
   quantitatively, the effects of various process parameters on foamy oil
   stability in the FOAM H-n-P process. A series of experiments were
   conducted to evaluate FOAM H-n-P performance and to examine the effect
   of various foaming agent injection parameters on oil recovery. The
   experimental results show that foaming oil stability increases with
   greater foaming agent concentration, greater initial heavy oil height, a
   higher degree of gas bubble dispersiveness, and smaller dispersed gas
   bubble size. The FOAM H-n-P process can substantially improve heavy oil
   recovery performance. The most efficient case increases oil recovery by
   43.29\% OOIP, compared to the traditional methane huff-n-puff process.
   The above knowledge will have significant importance for the development
   of heavy oil resources in thin reservoirs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Nitrogen-doped and Undoped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were synthesized by
   selective transmission of source and carrier gases (ethane, ammonia,
   hydrogen, and argon) over an alumina-supported iron catalyst in a quartz
   tubular reactor at 650 degrees C. Conductive nanocomposites were
   prepared by mixing CNTs and a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) matrix
   using a small scale melt mixer (APAM mixer) at 240 degrees C and 235
   rpm. Various characterization techniques, such as X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy
   revealed that nitrogen doping altered the structure of CNTs, reduced the
   aspect ratio, deteriorated the crystalline structure, and changed the
   electronic properties of CNTs. It was also observed that the Undoped
   CNT/PVDF nanocomposites presented better state of dispersion, higher
   electrical conductivity, lower percolation threshold, and significantly
   higher electromagnetic interference shielding than their Nitrogen-doped
   counterparts. For instance, at 3.5wt\% the Undoped CNT/PVDF
   nanocomposites shielded the incident electromagnetic wave 16 times more
   than the Nitrogen-doped ones. The enhanced electrical properties of the
   Undoped CNT/PVDF nanocomposites were attributed to enhanced dispersion,
   superior crystalline structure, and higher aspect ratio of Undoped CNTs.

Abstract = {{A possibility of low temperature catalytic steam gasification of n-C-5
   asphaltenes mixed in light cyclic oil (LCO) in a fixed bed reactor is
   tested and presented. Four meta kaolin based catalysts containing one
   alkali (K or Cs), one alkaline earth (Ca or Ba) metal oxides were
   characterized and tested. Two of these four catalysts also contained NiO
   nanoparticles in addition to alkali and alkaline earth metal oxides.
   Addition of sugar as a porogen to kaolin created meso as well as
   macroporosity. These mesoporous-macroporous meta kaolin based materials
   are intended to work mainly as catalysts for steam gasification of the
   adsorbed asphaltenes. XRD data showed presence of Ni3S2 in the spent
   catalyst. It was found that low temperature catalytic steam gasification
   was possible by all four catalysts. However, replacement of Ca by Ba
   increased H-2 production. Also, incorporation of Niananoparticles
   promoted further H-2 production during the steam gasification of the
   adsorbed asphaltenes, leading to CO2 and H-2 as major products with less
   side reactions. Of the two nickel-based catalysts, 3NiO6Cs6Ba seems to
   be the more promising material, with slightly lower activation energy,
   and higher production of gases per mole of metal contained in the
   catalyst. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Cold production has been established as a key recovery process used to
   recover viscous oil from Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) heavy
   oil reservoirs. Field production has demonstrated that aggressive sand
   production improves the recovery performance leading to the Cold Heavy
   Oil Production with Sand (CHOPS) process. The produced sand volume is
   speculated to produce wormholes - depleted high permeability sand
   channels within the heavy oil reservoir. Extensive laboratory
   experiments, field tracer tests and modelling of CHOPS have demonstrated
   that high permeability channels are formed but as yet, the mechanisms of
   the initiation and growth of wormholes remain unclear. These processes
   are effective for producing fossil fuels, in the form of heavy oil,
   because they are primary production processes with small amounts of
   energy used to produce the oil. In this study, we use the minimum
   fluidization velocity concept to model the CHOPS process in a heavy oil
   field located in the Cold Lake area. In this model, wormhole growth
   evolves in the reservoir considering foamy oil flow, sand fluidization,
   and sand production. The results demonstrate that the model provides a
   reasonable and robust representation of the production process. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This article presents the results of an evaluation of a candidate
   variable speed limit (VSL) system that takes the space mean speeds
   (SMSs) from probe vehicles as its main input. The presented algorithm
   extends the capability of a model predictive control (MPC) VSL model
   with the input of SMS derived from vehicle probes and their
   corresponding space-based densities, instead of spot-based densities and
   detector speeds. The developed probe-based VSL was evaluated on an 8-km
   stretch of Highway 2, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, using Paramics
   microsimulation software. The performance of the probe-based VSL
   algorithm was examined under various traffic conditions and probe
   vehicle parameters. The findings of the probe-based VSL analysis support
   previous findings taking input from point detectors and showing that the
   efficiency of the VSL strategies was efficient only for a limited range
   of traffic conditions. The results of the analysis show the
   effectiveness of developing advanced freeway control algorithms that use
   the main input parameters from vehicle probes. The performance of the
   probe-based VSL system was also comparable to, and in some cases
   outperformed, the point-based detector algorithm. However, the algorithm
   was shown to be effective only for a high frequency of information
   updates and under a relatively high percentage of vehicles probe

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{495-505}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The effects of finite efficiency on wake interference and power output
   are studied for identical horizontal-axis wind turbines in line with the
   wind. Interference occurs whenever turbines reduce the power available
   to any turbines downwind of them. The analysis uses wake models that are
   commonly employed in wind farm layout design. The aerodynamic efficiency
   is varied from 75\% to 100\% for six identical hypothetical turbines in
   line parallel to the wind direction with spacing from four to six rotor
   diameters. Selfish optimization of the power output of individual
   turbines and co-operative optimization of the total power are
   considered. For selfish control, all turbines operate at the maximum
   possible local C-P, based on the aerodynamic efficiency. For
   co-operative optimization, each turbine operates at a C-P value between
   zero and the selfish value, and the total power is optimized
   numerically. The results show that at low efficiency, there is little
   difference in total power output between the two strategies. As
   efficiency increases, co-operative optimization produces increasingly
   more power. As turbine spacing increases, the difference between the
   strategies decreases. There is, however, a realistic range of
   efficiencies and spacing over which more power is delivered by
   co-operative optimization. The simplest form of co-operative
   optimization requires reducing the power output of the most upwind
   turbine to allow increased performance from those downwind. This should
   be an easy strategy to implement in wind farm control.}},

Abstract = {{In order to track the carrier phases of Global Navigation Satellite
   Systems (GNSS) signals in signal degraded environments, a dual antenna
   joint carrier tracking loop is proposed and evaluated. This proposed
   tracking loop processes inputs from two antennas, namely the master
   antenna and the slave antenna. The master antenna captures signals in
   open-sky environments, while the slave antenna capture signals in
   degraded environments. In this architecture, a Phase Lock Loop (PLL) is
   adopted as a master loop to track the carrier phase of the open-sky
   signals. The Doppler frequency estimated by this master loop is utilized
   to assist weak carrier tracking in the slave loop. As both antennas
   experience similar signal dynamics due to satellite motion and clock
   frequency variations, a much narrower loop bandwidth and possibly a
   longer coherent integration can be adopted to track the weak signals in
   slave channels, by utilizing the Doppler aid from master channels. PLL
   tracking performance is affected by the satellite/user dynamics, clock
   instability, and thermal noise. In this paper, their impacts on the
   proposed phase tracking loop are analyzed and verified by both
   simulation and field data. Theoretical analysis and experimental results
   show that the proposed loop structure can track degraded signals (i.e.,
   18 dB-Hz) with a very narrow loop bandwidth (i.e., 0.5 Hz) and a TCXO
   clock.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: We propose the use of a retrospectively gated cine fast spin
   echo (FSE) sequence for characterization of carotid artery dynamics. The
   aim of this study was to compare cine FSE measures of carotid dynamics
   with measures obtained on prospectively gated FSE images.
   Methods: The common carotid arteries in 10 volunteers were imaged using
   two temporally resolved sequences: (i) cine FSE and (ii) prospectively
   gated FSE. Three raters manually traced a common carotid artery area for
   all cardiac phases on both sequences. Measured areas and
   systolic-diastolic area changes were calculated and compared. Inter-and
   intra-rater reliability were assessed for both sequences.
   Results: No significant difference between cine FSE and prospectively
   gated FSE areas were observed (P = 0.36). Both sequences produced
   repeatable cross-sectional area measurements: inter-rater intraclass
   correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.88 on cine FSE images and 0.87 on
   prospectively gated FSE images. Minimum detectable difference (MDD) in
   systolic-diastolic area was 4.9 mm(2) with cine FSE and 6.4 mm(2) with
   prospectively gated FSE.
   Conclusion: This cine FSE method produced repeatable dynamic carotid
   artery measurements with less artifact and greater temporal efficiency
   compared with prospectively gated (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new Doherty amplifier architecture along with an
   analytical based design methodology is proposed. The proposed
   architecture uses novel three-port network as the output
   matching/combining network (OMCN). The three-port OMCN performs the
   power combining for any arbitrary output power ratios from the two
   transistors of the Doherty amplifier. It also performs the impedance
   matching from any arbitrary complex load impedance to the optimum
   impedances for both transistors at peak output power. Commonly in
   Doherty amplifiers, an optimum performance at peak power and a
   sub-optimum performance at power back-off are often obtained. Using the
   proposed output network, optimum performance can be reached at power
   back-off, as well as at peak power. Another three-port network is
   proposed for input matching/dividing network (IMDN) at the input of the
   proposed Doherty amplifier. The three-port IMDN is designed to perform
   the power division with any arbitrary division ratio, adjust the
   arbitrary phase difference between the input signals to the two
   transistors, and provide the impedance matching from any arbitrary
   complex source impedance to the optimal source impedances for the two
   transistors. To verify the provided theory, two prototype amplifiers are
   designed and tested. A 12-W amplifier is designed for a 50-source and
   load impedances at 1 GHz. Another 12-W amplifier is designed at 1 GHz
   for complex source and load impedances. Both amplifiers have efficiency
   of higher than 50\% at 7-dB output power range.}},

Abstract = {{We present a mathematical model of structural reorganisation in a
   fibre-reinforced composite material in which the fibres are oriented
   statistically, i.e. obey a probability distribution of orientation. Such
   a composite material exemplifies a biological tissue (e.g. articular
   cartilage or a blood vessel) whose soft matrix is reinforced by collagen
   fibres. The structural reorganisation of the composite takes place as
   fibres reorient, in response to mechanical stimuli, in order to optimise
   the stress distribution in the tissue. Our mathematical model is based
   on the Principle of Virtual Powers and the study of dissipation. Besides
   incompressibility, our main hypothesis is that the composite is
   characterised by a probability density distribution that measures the
   probability of finding a family of fibres aligned along a given
   direction at a fixed material point. Under this assumption, we describe
   the reorientation of fibres as the evolution of the most probable
   direction along which the fibres are aligned. To test our theory, we
   compare our simulations of a benchmark problem with selected results
   taken from the literature.}},

Year = {{2015}},

Pages = {{1-17}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A large portion of the total number of motor collisions can be boundary
   collisions; therefore, exaggerated or underestimated numbers for
   boundary collisions aggregated into neighbourhoods may hamper road
   safety analyses and management. In this paper, we propose a systematic
   framework for boundary collision aggregation. First, an entropy-based
   histogram thresholding method is utilized to determine the boundary zone
   size and identify boundary collisions. Next, the collision density
   probability distribution is then established, based on the collisions in
   each neighbourhood. Last, an effective boundary collision aggregation
   method, called the collision density ratio (CDR), is used to aggregate
   boundary collisions into neighbourhoods. The proposed framework is
   applied to collision data in the City of Edmonton for a case study. The
   experimental results show that the proposed entropy-based histogram
   thresholding method can identify boundary collision with the high
   precision and recall, and the proposed CDR method is more effective than
   the existing methods, the half-to-half ratio method and the one-to-one
   ratio method, to aggregate boundary collisions into neighbourhoods. (C)

Abstract = {{During the last decades, the number of vehicles per citizen as well as
   the traffic speed and load has dramatically increased. This sudden and
   somehow unplanned overloading has strongly shortened the life of
   pavements and increased its cost of maintenance and risks to users. In
   order to limit the deterioration of road networks, it is necessary to
   improve the quality and performance of pavements, which was achieved
   through the addition of a polymer to the bituminous binder. Since their
   introduction, polymer-modified asphalts have gained in importance during
   the second half of the twentieth century, and they now play a
   fundamental role in the field of road paving. With high-temperature and
   high-shear mixing with asphalt, the polymer incorporates asphalt
   molecules, thereby forming a swallowed network that involves the entire
   binder and results in a significant improvement of the viscoelastic
   properties in comparison with those of the unmodified binder. Such a
   process encounters the well-known difficulties related to the poor
   solubility of polymers, which limits the number of macromolecules able
   to not only form such a structure but also maintain it during
   high-temperature storage in static conditions, which may be necessary
   before laying the binder. Therefore, polymer-modified asphalts have been
   the subject of numerous studies aimed to understand and optimize their
   structure and storage stability, which gradually attracted polymer
   scientists into this field that was initially explored by civil
   engineers. The analytical techniques of polymer science have been
   applied to polymer-modified asphalts, which resulted in a good
   understanding of their internal structure. Nevertheless, the complexity
   and variability of asphalt composition rendered it nearly impossible to
   generalize the results and univocally predict the properties of a given
   polymer/asphalt pair.
   The aim of this paper is to review these aspects of polymer-modified
   asphalts. Together with a brief description of the specification and
   techniques proposed to quantify the storage stability, state-of-the-art
   knowledge about the internal structure and morphology of
   polymer-modified asphalts is presented. Moreover, the chemical,
   physical, and processing solutions suggested in the scientific and
   patent literature to improve storage stability are extensively
   discussed, with particular attention to an emerging class of asphalt
   binders in which the technologies of polymer-modified asphalts and
   polymer nanocomposites are combined. These polymer-modified asphalt
   nanocomposites have been introduced less than ten years ago and still do
   not meet the requirements of industrial practice, but they may
   constitute a solution for both the performance and storage requirements.

Abstract = {{A novel polar modulator-based transmitter architecture that uses an
   analog RF variable gain amplifier (VGA) and an analog phase shifter is
   proposed and implemented using discrete elements. This architecture
   translates the baseband phase signal to RF without using mixers and
   quadrature up-converter circuits. Accordingly, spurs and distortions
   that are typically associated with the mixers are absent over a wide
   frequency band. As such, no filtering is needed at the output of the
   proposed transmitter. The absence of RF band pass filter provides wider
   RF bandwidth which would make the transmitter design reconfigurable and
   more suitable for integration. The proposed transmitter architecture has
   unusual signal distortion effects due to amplitude and phase
   nonlinearity in the VGA and the phase shifter. Indeed, this distortion
   consists not only in amplitude-to-amplitude (AM/AM) and
   amplitude-to-phase (AM/PM) distortions, but also includes
   phase-to-amplitude (PM/AM) and phase-to-phase (PM/PM) distortion. Hence,
   a new behavioral model using augmented complex memory polynomial is
   proposed to mitigate these complex nonlinear effects. The performance of
   the linearized transmitter is tested using long-term evolution (LTE)
   signals and the signal quality is assessed in terms of error vector
   magnitude (EVM). The measured EVM of the LTE signal of 1.4 MHz bandwidth
   at the output of the transmitter improved from 9.82\% to 0.43\% using
   digital predistortion technique. The measured adjacent channel
   leakage-power ratio (ACLR) of the proposed transmitter is 59 dBc.}},

Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{We utilize the CMP Cross-Correlation of Surface Waves (CCSW) to obtain a
   high-resolution S-wave velocity model for the calculation of PS receiver
   static corrections. We cross-correlate each trace of a shot record with
   a reference trace that is selected from within the shot gather based on
   high signal to noise ratio. New midpoints that relate to the correlated
   traces are then calculated. Thereafter, we calculate the phase velocity
   for each CMP gather, and we convert the resulting dispersion curve to an
   S-wave model. Moreover, we show that, to achieve a precise estimate of a
   dispersion curve in a CMP gather, we should only consider those traces
   whose offsets lay in a spatial window length. We empirically find that
   an optimum window length (aperture) should be about one to one and a
   half times of the maximum wavelength of the fundamental mode of surface
   wave. When the aperture is optimum, we observe a distinguishable trend
   of the phase velocity of each mode within the dispersion curve that
   avoids mode misidentification. In addition, we show the importance of
   wavelength-dependent aperture for estimating the phase velocity when
   there is a wide range of wavelength in a data set. We obtain static
   corrections based on an S-wave velocity model obtained from CCSW and
   successfully apply them to a field data. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the dynamic analysis and experimental validation
   of a method to perturb the balance of subjects in quiet standing.
   Electronically released weights pull the subject's waist through a

   of waist acceleration. This model accurately predicts the acceleration
   of mock subjects (suspended masses) with high repeatability. The
   validity and simplicity of this model suggest that this method can
   provide a standard for provocation testing on stable surfaces.
   Proof-of-concept trials on human subjects demonstrate that the device
   can be used with a force platform and motion tracking and that the

Abstract = {{Negotiation is an integral part of our daily life and plays an important
   role in resolving conflicts and facilitating human interactions.
   Automated negotiation, which aims at capturing the human negotiation
   process using artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques,
   is well-established in e-commerce, but its application in environmental
   resource management remains limited. This is due to the inherent
   uncertainties and complexity of environmental issues, along with the
   diversity of stakeholders' perspectives when dealing with these issues.
   The objective of this paper is to describe the main components of
   automated negotiation, review and compare machine learning techniques in
   automated negotiation, and provide a guideline for the selection of
   suitable methods in the particular context of stakeholders' negotiation
   over environmental resource issues. We advocate that automated
   negotiation can facilitate the involvement of stakeholders in the
   exploration of a plurality of solutions in order to reach a mutually
   satisfying agreement and contribute to informed decisions in
   environmental management along with the need for further studies to
   consolidate the potential of this modeling approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   formulated based on joint chance-constrained programming (CCP) and is
   solved by incorporating sensitivity into iterative algorithms. These
   algorithms exploit the characteristics of the system and its response to
   load variations. Sensitivities help to classify buses according to
   stress level, and sensitivity-based iterative algorithms distinguish
   each bus based on its contribution to the overall system reliability.
   The use of sensitivity overcomes some of the mathematical obstacles to
   solving joint CCP problems and, in addition, leads to optimal expansion
   solutions because uncertain loads are correctly estimated. The IEEE 30-
   and 118-bus test systems are used to demonstrate the proposed
   algorithms, and the results Of these algorithms are compared with those
   of other algorithms for solving the joint CCP problem. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The species and distribution of phosphorus (P) in an enhanced biological
   phosphorus removal (EBPR)-aerobic granular sludge (AGS) were
   fractionated and further analyzed. Results showed that microbial cells,
   extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and mineral precipitates
   contributed about 73.7\%, 17.6\% and 5.3-6.4\% to the total P (TP) of
   EBPR-AGS, respectively. Inorganic P (IP) species were orthophosphate,
   pyrophosphate and polyphosphate among which polyphosphate was the major
   P species in the AGS, cells and EPS. Monoester and diester phosphates
   were identified as the organic P (OP) species in the AGS and cells.
   Hydroxyapatite (Ca-5(PO4)(3)OH) and calcium phosphate (Ca-2(PO4)(3))
   were the dominant P minerals accumulated in the core of the granules.
   Cells along with polyphosphate were mainly in the outer layer of AGS
   while EPS were distributed in the whole granules. Based on the above
   results, the distribution of IP and OP species in AGS has been
   conceived. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The viscosity of bitumen is extremely high at low temperature (reservoir
   and atmospheric conditions). Therefore, the viscosity reduction is
   essential for bitumen production, pipeline transportation, and
   processing. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of
   temperature, pressure, and solvent weight fraction on the physical
   properties of bitumen. The experiments were conducted using Athabasca
   bitumen sample and n-heptane at temperatures from 22 to 190 degrees C
   and at pressures up to 10 MPa for mixtures with different n-heptane
   fractions. The measured density and viscosity data were examined with
   available models in the literature. The mixture densities were well
   predicted with the assumption of no volume change on mixing. Increasing
   n-heptane concentration results in higher deviation of model from data
   up to 0.5 n-heptane weight fraction. The viscosity of the bitumen
   significantly reduced with temperature and n-heptane dilution. The
   effect of pressure on the viscosity was higher at either low n-heptane
   weight fractions or low temperature. The viscosity data were well
   represented by the power law and Cragoe's models using the volume
   fractions with 7.0\% and 13.6\% average absolute relative deviation
   (AARD), respectively. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Building consensus in life cycle assessment: the potential for a
   Canadian product category rules standard to enhance credibility in
   greenhouse gas emissions estimates for Alberta's oil sands}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{525-533}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Life cycle assessment (LCA) of greenhouse gas emissions is often used to
   compare products in the global crude market While Alberta's oil sands
   face particular pressure to improve performance, a lack of consensus on
   methods, data, and assumptions specific to the LCA of products derived
   from crude oil weaken such comparisons. This paper investigates the
   potential for a Canadian product category rules standard to enhance the
   credibility of life cycle emissions estimates of products derived from
   Alberta's oil sands. Increasing comparability of Canadian crudes to
   those of other countries in such a way would make this an attractive
   tool with the potential to be adopted internationally. The potential of
   the standard is investigated through a case study, based on in-depth
   expert interviews, focusing first on the potential of the standard to
   mitigate specific data and communication issues with respect to
   Alberta's oil sands, and second on strategies to mitigate predicted
   process issues in its development by a Canadian standards development
   organization. Findings indicate that while there is a consensus on the
   need to further standardize LCA methods and data quality requirements
   for crude oil products to make comparisons more accurate, participants
   in the standards-setting process may be unwilling to share the
   information that would make this possible. It was found that a credible
   standards-setting process may help to overcome this challenge, only if
   the ability to revise the standard can be anticipated in its initial
   development process, particularly with respect to its long-term effects
   on the development of new technologies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In a previous study, we showed that Ni-Pd bimetallic nanocatalysts
   supported on fumed silica had better adsorption affinity and catalytic
   activity toward adsorption and post-adsorption decomposition of
   asphaltenes compared to the support without functionalization. In this
   study, the effect of oxide support types on the adsorption and
   subsequent steam gasification of adsorbed asphaltenes was studied over
   Ni-Pd bimetallic nanocatalysts supported on TiO2 or gamma-Al2O3
   nanoparticles. X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron
   microscopy (FESEM) and N-2 physisorption at 77 K were used to
   characterize the crystal size and surface area of NiO and/or
   PdO-supported-on-TiO2 or gamma-Al2O3 nanoparticles, respectively. The
   type of support was shown to affect the adsorption affinity and
   catalytic activity of the particles; Ni-Pd/TiO2 nanoparticles showed
   higher adsorption capacity and catalytic activity than
   Ni-Pd/gamma-Al2O3, presumably due to different metal-support interaction
   and geometric and electronic effects on the surface. Bimetallic
   nanoparticles appeared to have better adsorption and catalytic behavior
   than monometallic nanoparticles regardless of the oxide support used,
   confirming their synergistic effect. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{504}},
Number = {{SI}},

Month = {{SEP 5}},
Abstract = {{One of the ways to dispose of spent carbon-based catalysts is
   gasification. In this study, the kinetics of CO2 gasification of
   Ni/activated carbon (AC) catalysts, produced from petroleum coke, were
   investigated at 700-900 degrees C using a thermogravimetric analyzer
   (TGA). The catalysts were coked by exposure to ethylene at 400-600
   degrees C and/or impregnated with 3 or 8 wt\% vanadium, which is
   typically deposited during hydrodemetalization (HDM) of heavy oil. The
   gasification rates of all samples were 30-400 times greater than the
   rate of gasification of uncatalyzed (i.e., no metal) AC. Rate profiles
   as a function of conversion were different for all samples, which
   suggested that nickel was promoted/inhibited as a gasification catalyst
   in different ways depending on the composition of the sample.
   Transmission electron microscopy was used to analyze samples before and
   after gasification. The particle morphologies and chemical analysis
   (energy-dispersive X-ray) help to explain the different gasification
   behaviors. In particular, the nickel particles on the coked Ni/AC sample
   became encapsulated by graphite and sintered over time from 20 nm
   initially to 150 nm after 80\% conversion (similar to 10 min at 900
   degrees C). For the Ni/AC catalysts impregnated with vanadium, the AC
   support was decorated with similar to 10 nm nickel particles and wetted
   with a layer of vanadium after preparation at 500 degrees C. After
   heating to 900 degrees C, however, sintering of both metals was evident
   as well as the formation of new vanadium species including vanadium
   carbide in some areas. The interaction between nickel and vanadium
   lowered the initial gasification rate but also slowed the deactivation
   of the nickel during gasification. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Maritime surveillance is an important application of synthetic aperture
   radar and is one of the objectives of the RADARSAT Constellation, the
   next generation of Canada's RADARSAT satellites. The RADARSAT
   Constellation will be able to collect both circular transmit, linear
   receive (CTLR) compact polarimetric data and linear dual-polarization
   data in a variety of wide swath imaging modes. In this article, we focus
   on the medium-resolution and low-resolution modes in order to assess the
   capability of the RADARSAT Constellation to both detect ships and
   icebergs in ocean imagery and then to discriminate between them after
   detection is performed. We first performed target detection, using a
   method whereby the false alarm rate was adjusted from pixel to pixel
   based on the properties of the received polarization ellipse. We then
   attempted to discriminate between the detected ship and iceberg targets
   using a support vector machine classifier. Measuring the discrimination
   accuracy using stratified 10-fold cross-validation, we found that the
   CTLR data had an accuracy of 99.3\% for the medium-resolution imaging
   mode compared to 96.5\% for the HH-HV dual-polarization. Further work is
   necessary using a wider variety of data, but RADARSAT Constellation data
   seem to have strong potential for ocean target detection and
   discrimination.}},

   chemical route using potassium permanganate and some second acids.
   High-density polyethylene (HDPE)/GNR nanocomposite samples were then
   prepared through a solution mixing procedure. Different nanocomposite
   dispersion states were achieved using different GNR synthesis methods
   providing different surface chemistry, interparticle interactions, and
   internal compartments. Prolonged relaxation of flow induced molecular
   orientation was observed due to the presence of both carbon nanotubes
   and GNRs. Based on the results of this work, due to relatively weak
   interactions between the polymer and the nanofillers, it is expected
   that short-range interactions between nanofillers play the key role in
   the final dispersion state.}},

Abstract = {{Production data analysis for low-permeability unconventional reservoirs
   is a challenging task, particularly for cases where multi-phase flow
   occurs within the reservoir. Analytical models developed to account for
   multi-phase flow typically require calculation of pseudo variables,
   which in turn require knowledge of relative permeability and fluid data.
   In the presence of sparse sampling, the analytical models often do not
   provide satisfactory results when there are so many unknown parameters.
   In such situations, numerical models are better suited, using a history
   matching framework to assist with reservoir and fluid characterization.
   In this work, we implement an assisted history-matching routine to
   characterize reservoir fluids and extract reservoir and hydraulic
   fracture properties for a hydraulically-fractured horizontal well
   completed in a tight gas condensate reservoir within the Montney
   Formation in western Alberta, Canada. The initial water distribution
   (e.g. movable water profile in the reservoir), in situ fluid (e.g.
   initial hydrocarbon composition with C7+ properties) and reservoir
   properties (e.g. permeability in the matrix and around the fracture, and
   pressure dependent fracture permeability) are described in terms of 20
   unknown parameters, which creates a high-dimensional inverse problem. We
   use the Differential Evolution algorithm, which is a powerful
   population-based optimization algorithm, and employ numerical
   compositional simulations to match pressure, water and hydrocarbon
   rates, and surface compositions of the produced fluids. Application of
   this optimization routine results in a good match to all measured data.
   The DE algorithm is repeated for an extra run to check for the existence
   of other non-unique solutions. The history-match results helped
   determine parameters for well/reservoir description and develop a
   compositional fluid model based on the measured separator composition
   data. The collected samples for both DE runs, along with one thousand
   extra samples from quasi-random sequence sampling design, provide a pool
   of data with invaluable information that are used to perform the global
   sensitivity analysis and to rank the contribution of each descriptive
   parameter on the variances of the reservoir outputs. In this way, the
   value of production data and surface compositions for the
   characterization of reservoir and fluid is quantified.
   This work aims to provide a practical and simple workflow for analysis
   of unconventional reservoirs where the direct analytical approaches
   cannot be applied. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{History-matching and forecasting tight/shale gas condensate wells using
   combined analytical, semi-analytical, and empirical methods}},

Abstract = {{The primary focus of the majority of current, and foreseeable, natural
   gas drilling within North America is low-permeability liquid-rich gas
   and gas condensate reservoirs, where the liquid fraction is now a major
   source of revenue. Development of these liquid-rich resources is aided
   by the use of multi-fractured horizontal wells (MFHWs), and is at an
   early stage; further research is required to appropriately manage the
   resource for optimal hydrocarbon recovery.
   The appropriate forecasting methodologies to apply to these tight
   liquid-rich plays are a focus of current research. While numerical
   simulation is the most rigorous forecasting methodology, practitioners
   have turned to simple analytical and empirical methods because of their
   ease-of-use and requirement of less data. However, these analytical and
   empirical approaches have limitations that limit their applicability for
   unconventional resevoirs with complex reservoir, hydraulic fracture and
   fluid properties.
   In this study, the workflow of Clarkson (2013b) is applied to address
   the limitations of existing empirical and analytical methods for
   forecasting MFHWs producing from liquid-rich tight gas/shale. The
   workflow calls for constraint of analytical models by linking inputs to
   rate-transient analysis-derived reservoir and hydraulic fracture
   properties, and constraining empirical model forecasts to be consistent
   with analytical model forecasts. In order to address the range in
   reservoir/fracture properties observed in shales, a suite of analytical
   models is proposed. Similarly, a suite of empirical methods is used, and
   the models yielding the most accurate matches to the analytical models
   are selected for forecasting. Lastly, in order to bridge the gap between
   analytical and empirical methods, the semi-analytical method introduced
   by Clarkson and Qanbari (2015), which has as its basis the contacted
   gas-in-place calculations of Agarwal (2010), is also used for
   forecasting.
   An important contribution of this work is the demonstration of the
   applicability of the analytical and semi-analytical models used in this
   work for tight gas/shale gas condensate MFHWs exhibiting multi-phase
   flow in the reservoir. As demonstrated in this study using simulation
   cases, constant condensate gas ratios can occur for tight/shale gas
   condensate wells exhibiting transient linear flow and flowing at near
   constant flowing bottomhole pressure, even for relatively rich gas
   cases, rendering the single-phase forecasting methods useful for
   forecasting gas and condensate phases. The accuracy of these methods is
   tested using simulated cases, and practicality of the workflow
   demonstrated using an actual field example of a liquid-rich shale MFHW.
   This study will be of interest to those petroleum engineers who are
   faced with forecasting a large number of liquid-rich shale wells, and
   desire methods that can be simply applied to constrain forecasts and
   improve accuracy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in the porosity and permeability of a porous medium due to
   melting are modeled. A frozen phase, which initially fills a part of the
   porous medium, melts and gets dissolved in the injected hot solvent. The
   amount of melted material, the rate of melting as well as the profiles
   of temperature, porosity, and concentration are analyzed to understand
   the nature of this naturally and industrially important phenomenon. Four
   reference scenarios corresponding to instantaneous thermal equilibrium,
   no heat transfer to the frozen phase, no-melting, and instantaneous
   melting conditions are solved analytically and the effects of different
   parameters are discussed. Numerical simulation results show that the
   profiles of the fluid temperature, porosity of the medium, and solvent
   concentration, form three fronts moving at different rates. it is found
   that for heat transfer coefficients above a certain value, the rate of
   melting is independent of this parameter and the system can be
   considered to have reached instantaneous thermal equilibrium. Moreover,
   slow heat transfer in the medium is shown to increase the rate of
   melting at long time periods by involving larger areas in the melting
   process. Heterogeneous scenarios are also analyzed by introducing frozen
   blocks of different geometries. The ability of the flow to bypass the
   frozen region involves a new heat transfer mechanism identified as
   outer-boundary convection. The effects of the geometry of the block
   along with the other parameters on the melting process are examined.
   Furthermore a generalizing scheme is proposed to predict the melt
   production for different block geometries and values of the saturation
   of the frozen phase. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-thermal fluid is a new hear carrier proposed in decades. This
   paper introduces multi thermal fluid into the thermal recovery process
   of thick heavy oil reservoir (THOR). First, using the method of physical
   simulation, the superiority of multi-thermal fluid is investigated from
   the Pressure-Volume-Temperature (PVT) performance and displacing
   characteristics. Thereafter, based on multi-thermal fluid injection
   technology and steam-assisted-gravity-drainage (SAGD) theory, a new
   Improved-Oil-Recovery technique for THORs, Multi-thermal Fluid Assisted
   Gravity Drainage (MFAGD) technique is proposed in this paper. Applying
   the dimensionless scaling criterion of gravity-drainage process, two 3D
   gravity-drainage experiments (SAGD, SAGD-to-MFAGD) are conducted. Thus,
   the enhanced-oil-recovery (EOR) mechanisms of multi-thermal fluid in
   heavy oil reservoirs are analyzed, and the thermal recovery performance
   of MFAGD process is discussed. Results indicate that compared with SAGD
   process, MFAGD process has a higher recovery rate, and it could further
   improve the gravity-drainage effect in THOR. Besides the conventional
   operation of SAGD, the EOR mechanisms of MFAGD technique also include
   heat insulation, energy recovery, gas dissolution and auxiliary cleanup
   of non-condensable gas. This method technologically supports the
   effective and efficient development of THORs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Drilling simulation technology has been used extensively to optimize
   drilling operations so as to minimize the associated costs and risks.
   Optimum bit types and designs with corresponding drilling parameters can
   be recommended utilizing a simulator with rate of penetration (ROP)
   models. There have been several attempts to develop ROP models that can
   deliver the most reliable outputs, required for the pre-planning and
   post analysis applications, using various sets of drilling parameters.
   However, due to the existing modeling complexities, these attempts have
   not been successful. In this study, a new ROP model is developed for the
   rollercone bits, which properly integrates the effect of main drilling
   parameters as well as cutting structure of the bit. The model is
   mathematically derived based on the mechanism of single cutter-rock
   interaction, and calibrated utilizing sets of full scale laboratory
   data. Also, the bit wear effect for simulating accurate rock strength
   and ROP values is included in the analysis using a previously published
   model. One of the most important features of the newly introduced ROP
   model is that it can be easily inverted to generate accurate rock
   strength values using offset and/or real-time field data This unique
   characteristic of the ROP model makes it a valuable candidate for
   drilling simulation studies to optimize drilling operations in the most
   cost effective manner. The verification of the introduced ROP model is
   performed through series of simulation analysis and comparing the
   generated rock strength logs to the outputs of a commercially available
   drilling simulator. The comparison of the results obtained from the
   simulator and the ROP model as well as field data has been quite
   encouraging which signifies the application of the developed model in
   determining the best case scenario for planning and/or drilling of
   future wells with lowest possible expenditures. (C) 2015 Elsevier BM.

Abstract = {{Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) has been the preferred thermal
   method for bitumen recovery from reservoirs in western Canada. To save
   energy and to be more environmentally friendly, ExpandingSolvent SAGD
   (ES-SAGD) is herein proposed by adding solvent into the injection vapor.
   The addition of solvent gives rise to different phase behavior
   (solvent-steam-bitumen) characteristics than that of the steam-only
   injection (steam-bitumen) process. Early steam condensation, solvent
   accumulation in the vapor phase, and convective oil flow near the steam
   boundary are critical mechanisms of the ES-SAGD process. In this paper,
   the phase behavior of the steam-solvent-bitumen system and solvent mass
   transfer in oil are studied through a numerical simulation method.
   Results show that the dominant mechanism of solvent dissolution in oil
   is by gas-oil equilibrium, rather than condensate mixing. The dissolved
   solvent is further convectively delivered into the mobile oil zone by
   gravity drainage. Under high solvent injection concentration, oil
   production rate is improved by the significant amount of solvent
   dissolution in oil. The high injection pressure enhances oil production
   rate through enlarging the mobile oil zone. In addition, this study
   proposes a steam-solvent injection strategy to improve the ES-SAGD
   process. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the physical nature and mechanical behaviour of
   hydrate-bearing sediments is of fundamental importance in assessing the
   resource potential of methane gas hydrates. Advances in pressure coring
   techniques and associated processing equipment have enabled intact
   samples to be recovered under in-situ pressures. However, testing of
   these samples under the in-situ stress conditions has not been possible.
   To help address this issue, the PCATS Triaxial apparatus was developed
   to enable the physical properties of such samples to be measured. The
   apparatus was deployed for the first time during the JOGMEC funded site
   investigation of the Eastern Nankai Trough in the summer of 2012, prior
   to a planned hydrate production test in 2013.
   A number of pressurized core were recovered and sub-samples successfully
   tested in PCATS Triaxial to determine a range of geomechanical
   properties, including small strain stiffness (from resonance testing),
   stress-strain properties (triaxial shear tests) and permeability.
   Samples tested included fine-grained soils with no appreciable hydrate,
   sands with hydrate saturation greater than 20\%, and one sample that had
   a combination of both materials. Testing showed an increase in stiffness
   and undrained shear strength with increasing grain size, hydrate
   saturation and applied effective stress. Permeability was significantly
   reduced for hydrate-bearing sands compared to clayey samples with no
   hydrate present. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring vehicular road traffic is a key component of any autonomous
   driving platform. Detecting moving objects, and tracking them, is
   crucial to navigating around objects and predicting their locations and
   trajectories. Laser sensors provide an excellent observation of the area
   around vehicles, but the point cloud of objects may be noisy, occluded,
   and prone to different errors. Consequently, object tracking is an open
   problem, especially for low-quality point clouds. This paper describes a
   pipeline to integrate various sensor data and prior information, such as
   a Geospatial Information System (GIS) map, to segment and track moving
   objects in a scene. We show that even a low-quality GIS map, such as
   OpenStreetMap (OSM), can improve the tracking accuracy, as well as
   decrease processing time. A bank of Kalman filters is used to track
   moving objects in a scene. In addition, we apply non-holonomic
   constraint to provide a better orientation estimation of moving objects.
   The results show that moving objects can be correctly detected, and
   accurately tracked, over time, based on modest quality Light Detection
   And Ranging (LiDAR) data, a coarse GIS map, and a fairly accurate Global
   Positioning System (GPS) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) navigation
   solution.}},

Abstract = {{Recent disasters, such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake, have drawn
   attention to the potential role of citizens as active information
   producers. By using location-aware devices such as smartphones to
   collect geographic information in the form of geo-tagged text, photos,
   or videos, and sharing this information through online social media,
   such as Twitter, citizens create Volunteered Geographic Information
   (VGI). To effectively use this information for disaster management, we
   developed a VGI framework for the discovery of VGI. This framework
   consists of four components: (i) a VGI brokering module to provide a
   standard service interface to retrieve VGI from multiple resources based
   on spatial, temporal, and semantic parameters; (ii) a VGI quality
   control component, which employs semantic filtering and
   cross-referencing techniques to evaluate VGI; (iii) a VGI publisher
   module, which uses a service-based delivery mechanism to disseminate
   VGI, and (iv) a VGI discovery component to locate, browse, and query
   metadata about available VGI datasets. In a case study we employed a
   FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) strategy, open
   standards/specifications, and free/open data to show the utility of the
   framework. We demonstrate that the framework can facilitate data
   discovery for disaster management. The addition of quality metrics and a
   single aggregated source of relevant crisis VGI will allow users to make
   informed policy choices that could save lives, meet basic humanitarian
   needs earlier, and perhaps limit environmental and economic damage.}},

Abstract = {{Islanded microgrids must be self-sufficient in terms of frequency and
   voltage control due to their islanded operation. A control strategy for
   frequency regulation by combining the operation of a wind generator, a
   diesel generator, a battery energy storage system and a dump load in a
   microgrid is proposed in this paper. In the proposed strategy, the
   control task is partitioned into two subtasks: 1) choosing the
   appropriate element to be used for regulation, and 2) providing
   frequency regulation. A global controller chooses the element to
   operate. Then, the frequency regulation is provided by separate
   individual controllers. The proposed control strategy is tested on a
   microgrid with mixed types of generation and modeled on Simulink. By
   monitoring the power of individual elements and system frequency, it is
   shown that the proposed control strategy operates efficiently. The
   proposed strategy facilitates the integration of renewable energy
   sources and enhances frequency regulation.}},

Journal = {{Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy}},
Year = {{2015}},

Number = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A vibration harvester is usually designed to work in resonance
   responding to source vibration. However, in many cases, this source
   vibration may occur at a wide range of frequencies. If the harvester has
   very narrow tuning range, it becomes ineffective when there is a
   mismatch in the frequencies between source excitation and device
   resonance. Increasing the bandwidth of vibration harvesters has been an
   important design objective. We propose a two-stage design to improve of
   a harvester's performance. In a previous work {[}J.S. Fernando and Q.
   Sun, Rev. Sci. Instrum. 84(11), 114704 (2013)], we have demonstrated
   that use of a two-stage design can increase the power production at a
   single frequency excitation. In this paper, we will show that a
   two-stage design can also increase the width of the usable frequency
   band of the harvester. An optimization routine was used to determine the
   optimal choice of harvester design parameters with respect to the
   maximization of an objective function. Experiments were used to verify
   the electromechanical model as well as the trends predicted by the
   optimization. Performance comparisons between single-and two-stage
   harvesters are made through numerical simulation and experiments. (C)

Title = {{Maximum wind turbine performance at low tip speed ratio}},
Journal = {{Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Wind turbines can approach the Betz-Joukowsky limit on maximum power
   only at sufficiently high tip speed ratio: in practice, for ratios in
   excess of about seven. This paper analyses the performance of a turbine
   with an infinite number of blades as the tip speed ratio decreases to
   zero, beginning with the two traditional ways of determining the maximum
   power. The first is the ``Glauert{''} optimization of the power
   extracted at every radius and the second is the ``Betz-Goldstein{''}
   optimization of the whole rotor with the wake represented as a rigid
   helicoidal sheet of constant pitch. At high tip speed ratio, the two
   methods give very similar power and both asymptote to the Betz-Joukowsky
   limit. As the ratio approaches zero, the differences become significant.
   It is shown that Glauert's analysis does not account for effect of the
   varying pitch on the axial velocity. In addition, there is a large and
   unphysical energy extraction by a stationary rotor, and an unphysical
   constant circumferential velocity. Glauert's analysis, however, gives
   positive torque on a stationary rotor, which is necessary to start a
   wind turbine, but the torque at very low tip speed ratio seems too high.
   In contrast, the Betz-Goldstein analysis implies no torque on a
   stationary rotor but the circumferential velocity is zero on the axis of
   rotation. A modification is proposed to the Betz-Goldstein analysis to
   yield positive torque on a stationary rotor. The modified Betz-Goldstein
   torque coefficient never exceeds 1/2 and the power is less than the
   Glauert optimum. Finally, the analysis for varying pitch is corrected
   and the power maximized numerically. The modification applied to the
   Betz-Goldstein rotor is required to produce torque on the stationary
   rotor. The maximum torque coefficient was 0.55, and the maximum power
   was again less than the Glauert maximum. As tip speed ratio increases,
   the power from all methods asymptotes to the Betz-Joukowsky limit. (C)

Abstract = {{The performance of the most commonly used chemical kinetics mechanisms
   is compared against a large set of experimental data, accumulated for
   syngas mixtures diluted with other gases such as CO2, H2O, N-2, and CH4.
   These dilutes are pertinent to syngas/biogas mixtures and could have
   significant effects on the combustion characteristics. The laminar flame
   speed and ignition delay are used as quantitative metrics to compare the
   simulation predictions with the experimental data. The experimental data
   include ignition measurements obtained from shock tubes and rapid
   compressions, and flame speed measurements obtained from spherical bombs
   as well as counterflow configurations covering a wide range of
   temperature, pressure, and equivalence ratios. The mixture compositions
   are systematically categorized in this study. After exhaustive
   comparisons, it is found that the NUIG2013 mechanism is in closest
   agreement with the measured ignition delay and laminar flame speed for
   the investigated mixtures. However, the predictions deviated
   significantly from the measured ignition delays for the H-2/CO/CO2,
   H-2/CO/CH4, and H-2/CO/CH4/CO2/H2O mixtures. We performed a sensitivity
   analysis on the ignition delay time of the H-2/CO/CO2, H-2/CO/CH4, and
   H-2/CO/CH4/CO2/H2O mixtures, using the NUIG2013 mechanism to identify
   the reactions that are responsible for the deviations. We found that by
   adopting a much lower rate constant expression {[}k(0)(CO2) = 8.82 X
   10(19) X T{[}K](-1.40) (cm(6)/mol(2)/s)] for H + O-2 (+CO2 = HO2 (+CO2)
   (R2), the NUIG2013 mechanism could accurately predict the ignition delay
   time of the H-2/CO/CO2 mixture at low pressures (P = 1.24-2.36 atm) and
   low temperatures (<1025 K) range. A new rate constant expression {[}k(3)
   = 2.3 x 10(8) x T{[}K](1.40) exp(-2850/T) (cm(3)/mol/s)] for the CH4 +
   OH = CH3 + H2O R3 reaction in the NUIG2013 mechanism is required to
   reconcile the discrepancy observed between the measured and simulated
   ignition delay time of the H-2/CO/CH4 and H-2/CO/CH4/CO2/H2O mixtures at
   P = 32 atm. In addition, the newly fitted rate constant expression for
   R3 improved the performance of the NUIG2013 mechanism in predicting the
   ignition delay of H-2/CH4 at P = 5, 10, and 20 atm. More importantly,
   the modifications made to the reactions (R2) and R3 did not
   substantially affect the NUIG2013 mechanism's excellent predictions of
   the flame speed. Hence, it is recommended that the rate constant
   expressions for (R2) and R3 be incorporated into the NUIG2013 mechanism
   for any study of the combustion characteristics of biogas/syngas
   mixtures.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, researchers are focusing on a new use of the Internet called
   the Internet of Things (IoT), in which enabled electronic devices can be
   remotely accessed over the Internet. As the realization of IoT concept
   is still in its early stages, manufacturers of Internet-connected
   devices and IoT web service providers are defining their proprietary
   protocols based on their targeted applications. Consequently, IoT
   becomes heterogeneous in terms of hardware capabilities and
   communication protocols. Addressing these heterogeneities by following
   open standards is a necessary step to communicate with various IoT
   devices. In this research, we assess the feasibility of applying
   existing open standards on resource-constrained IoT devices. The
   standard protocols developed in this research are OGC PUCK over
   Bluetooth, TinySOS, SOS over CoAP, and OGC SensorThings API. We believe
   that by hosting open standard protocols on IoT devices, not only do the
   devices become self-describable, self-contained, and interoperable, but
   innovative applications can also be easily developed with standardized
   interfaces. In addition, we use memory consumption, request message
   size, response message size, and response latency to benchmark the
   efficiency of the implemented protocols. In all, this research presents
   and evaluates standard-based solutions to better understand the
   feasibility of applying existing standards to the IoT vision.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Pore scale modeling method has been widely used in the petrophysical
   studies to estimate macroscopic properties (e.g. porosity, permeability,
   and electrical resistivity) of porous media with respect to their micro
   structures. Although there is a sumptuous literature about the
   application of the method to study flow in porous media, there are fewer
   studies regarding its application to thermal conduction
   characterization, and the estimation of effective thermal conductivity,
   which is a salient parameter in many engineering surveys (e.g.
   geothermal resources and heavy oil recovery). By considering thermal
   contact resistance, we demonstrate the robustness of the method for
   predicting the effective thermal conductivity. According to our results
   obtained from Utah oil sand samples simulations, the simulation of
   thermal contact resistance is pivotal to grant reliable estimates of
   effective thermal conductivity. Our estimated effective thermal
   conductivities exhibit a better compatibility with the experimental data
   in companion with some famous experimental and analytical equations for
   the calculation of the effective thermal conductivity. In addition, we
   reconstruct a porous medium for an Alberta oil sand sample. By
   increasing roughness, we observe the effect of thermal contact
   resistance in the decrease of the effective thermal conductivity.
   However, the roughness effect becomes more noticeable when there is a
   higher thermal conductivity of solid to fluid ratio. Moreover, by
   considering the thermal resistance in porous media with different grains
   sizes, we find that the effective thermal conductivity augments with
   increased grain size. Our observation is in a reasonable accordance with
   experimental results. This demonstrates the usefulness of our modeling
   approach for further computational studies of heat transfer in porous
   media. (C) 2015 Author(s).}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a Variable Speed Limit (VSL) control algorithm for
   simultaneously maximizing the mobility, safety and environmental benefit
   in a Connected Vehicle environment. Development of Connected Vehicle
   (CV)/Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technology has the potential to provide
   essential data at the microscopic level to provide a better
   understanding of real-time driver behavior. This paper investigated a
   VSL control algorithm using a microscopic approach by focusing on
   individual driver's behavior (e.g., acceleration and deceleration)
   through the use of Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach. A
   multi-objective optimization function was formulated with the aim of
   finding a balanced trade-off among mobility, safety and sustainability.
   A microscopic traffic flow prediction model was used to calculate Total
   Travel Time (TIT); a surrogate safety measure Time To Collision (TTC)
   was used to measure instantaneous safety; and, a microscopic fuel
   consumption model (VT-Micro) was used to measure the environmental
   impact. Real-time driver's compliance to the posted speed limit was used
   to adjust the optimal speed limit values. A sensitivity analysis was
   conducted to compare the performance of the developed approach for
   different weights in the objective function and for two different
   percentages of CV. The results showed that with 100\% penetration rate,
   the developed VSL approach outperformed the uncontrolled scenario
   consistently, resulting in up to 20\% of total travel time reductions,
   6-11\% of safety improvements and 5-16\% reduction in fuel consumptions.
   Our findings revealed that the scenario which optimized for safety
   alone, resulted in more optimum improvements as compared to the
   multi-criteria optimization. Thus, one can argue that in case of 100\%
   penetration rates of CVs, optimizing for safety alone is enough to
   achieve simultaneous and optimum improvements in all measures. However,
   mixed results were obtained in case of lower \% penetration rate which
   showed higher collision risk when optimizing for only mobility or fuel
   consumption. This indicates that with such \% penetration rate,
   multi-criteria optimization is crucial to realize optimum and balanced
   benefits for the examined measures. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{The dissolution of carbon dioxide (CO2) in deep saline aquifer water is
   recognized as one of the fundamental mechanisms in the subsurface for
   storing significant quantities of CO2. One fundamental physical effect
   of CO2 dissolution is the slight increase in water density in the layer
   in contact with the buoyant free-phase CO2 plume. Under specific
   conditions, this may lead to gravitational instability and the onset of
   free convection, significantly accelerating the dissolution of the
   free-phase CO2 by bringing CO2 in contact with a larger volume of
   aquifer water. It is also feasible to enhance CO2 dissolution using
   engineering methodologies such as injecting water on top of the plume of
   CO2. The objective of this review is to provide a perspective on the
   progress in modeling and experimental observations of physical aspects
   of CO2 dissolution in deep saline aquifers. We review the published
   research efforts concerning the physical effects of CO2 dissolution in
   formation water, the conditions under which process can be accelerated
   either naturally, such as by free convection, or by use of engineering
   methodologies, and the effects of CO2 dissolution on CO2 storage.
   Finally, we discuss areas in need of further research. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Web services have increasingly begun to rely on public cloud platforms.
   The virtualization technologies employed by public clouds can, however,
   trigger contention between virtual machines (VMs) for shared physical
   machine resources, thereby leading to performance problems for Web
   services. Past studies have exploited physical-machine-level performance
   metrics such as clock cycles per instruction to detect such
   platform-induced performance interference. Unfortunately, public cloud
   customers do not have access to such metrics. They can only typically
   access VM-level metrics and application-level metrics such as
   transaction response times, and such metrics alone are often not useful
   for detecting inter-VM contention. This poses a difficult challenge to
   Web service operators for detecting and mitigating platform-induced
   performance interference issues inside the cloud. We propose a
   machine-learning-based interference detection technique to address this
   problem. The technique applies collaborative filtering to predict
   whether a given transaction being processed by a Web service is
   adversely suffering from interference. The results can be then used by a
   management controller to trigger remedial actions, e.g., reporting
   problems to the system manager or switching cloud providers. Results
   using a realistic Web benchmark show that the approach is effective. The
   most effective variant of our approach is able to detect about 96\% of
   performance interference events with almost no false alarms.
   Furthermore, we show that a load redistribution technique that exploits
   the information from our detection technique is able to more effectively
   mitigate the interference than techniques that are interference
   agnostic.}},

Abstract = {{Minimizing the cost of deploying and operating a wireless sensor network
   (WSN) involves deciding how to partition a budget between competing
   expenses such as node hardware, energy, and labor. Most commercial
   network operators account for interest rates in their budgeting
   exercises, providing a financial incentive to defer some costs until a
   later time. In this paper, we propose a net present cost (NPC) model for
   WSN capital and operating expenses that accounts for interest rates. Our
   model optimizes the number, size, and spacing between expenditures in
   order to minimize the NPC required for the network to achieve a desired
   operational lifetime. In general, this optimization problem is
   non-convex, but if the spacing between expenditures is linearly
   proportional to the size of the expenditures, and the number of
   maintenance cycles is known in advance, the problem becomes convex and
   can be solved to global optimality. If non-deferrable recurring costs
   are low, then evenly spacing the expenditures can provide near-optimal
   results. With the provided models and methods, network operators can now
   derive a payment schedule to minimize NPC while accounting for various
   operational parameters. The numerical examples show substantial cost
   benefits under practical assumptions.}},

Abstract = {{A Summary Bone quality is affected by muscle forces and external forces.
   We investigated how micro-architecture is influenced in elite alpine
   skiers who have received high loading levels throughout their adolescent
   bone development. Bone strength was higher in skiers, likely due to
   external forces, but muscle forces may also be a significant
   contributor.
   Introduction Impact loading and muscle forces affect bone quality, but
   little is known about how they influence 3 dimensional aspects of bone
   structure. This study investigated bone quality in female and male elite
   alpine skiers using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed
   tomography (HR-pQCT).
   Methods HR-pQCT at the distal radius and tibia, whole-body lean mass,
   and muscle strength were assessed in 10 female (22.7 +/- 3.9 years) and
   12 male (25.5 +/- 3.3 years) Canadian national alpine team athletes and
   compared to recreationally active female (N = 10, 23.8 +/- 3.2 years)
   and male (N = 12; 23.7 +/- 3.6 years) control subjects. HR-pQCT standard
   parameters and customized cortical and finite element (FE) analyses were
   performed and analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Pearson's correlation.
   Results Male and female skiers had stronger bones than controls at
   radius (38-49 \%, p < 0.001) and tibia (24-28 \%, p < 0.001). This
   result was not consistently reflected by total bone mineral density
   (BMD) because higher trabecular BMD occurred in parallel with lower
   cortical BMD, which was due to a redistribution of mineral leading to a
   shift of the endocortical margin toward a thicker cortex. The
   endocortical regional adaptation was likely responsible for the greater
   strength of the athletes' bones. Lean mass and muscle strength was 29 to
   90 \% greater (p < 0.001) in athletes compared to controls. Good
   associations between muscle strength and FE-estimated bone strength were
   found (r = 0.63 to 0.80; p < 0.001), although micro-architecture was
   more strongly associated with muscle outcomes in females than males.
   Conclusions Higher bone strength in elite alpine skiers is achieved
   through micro-architectural adaptation that is not apparent by BMD
   measurements alone. The improved micro-architecture at radius and tibia
   suggests that muscle forces may play an important role in bone
   adaptation.}},

Title = {{The Impact of Vehicle Maneuvers on the Attitude Estimation of GNSS/INS

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEODESY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Integrated Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and Inertial
   Navigation Systems (INS) are the core of georeferencing Mobile Mapping
   Systems (MMS) data. Divergence of attitude errors is a dominant issue
   when an INS has to work as a stand-alone system for extended periods.
   This issue can be mitigated by taking specific vehicle maneuvers to make
   attitude errors observable. Since MMS applications are time consuming
   and costly, it is preferable to design the trajectory and motion of the
   mapping vehicles in advance, to guarantee the accuracy of the attitude
   estimation and minimize the cost. This article investigates the
   estimation accuracy of attitude under different vehicle maneuvers
   theoretically through the observability analysis method. Both
   theoretical analysis and tests show that the attitude estimation is
   significantly related with the type of vehicle maneuvers and motion
   parameters such as velocity, acceleration, and angular velocity. The
   motion with varying angular velocities is the most efficient motion to
   enhance the estimation of all attitude angles; the motion with varying
   accelerations can improve the yaw and pitch but has no effect on
   enhancing the roll. The uniform circular motion can improve the roll and
   pitch but has slight or no impact on enhancing the yaw (depending on the
   forward accelerometer error, the forward velocity, and the vertical
   angular velocity); the linear motion with a constant acceleration can
   improve the yaw (depending on the cross-track accelerometer error and
   the forward acceleration) and weakly improve the pitch but cannot
   improve the roll. The physical interpretations of these properties are
   also provided. The ``S{''}-shaped motion with varying angular velocities
   is suggested for efficient attitude estimation; however, the circle, or
   ``8{''}-shaped motion with uniform angular velocity, is not efficient
   for MMS applications.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of microwave irradiation and hydrogen peroxide addition on
   the removal of methyl orange by porous carbons (biochar and activated
   carbon) were investigated. There was no removal of methyl orange from
   the solution by biochar under microwave irradiation regardless of the
   presence of H2O2. In contrast, activated carbon could completely remove
   the dye under the experimental conditions. To investigate whether the
   removal was attributed to adsorption or degradation, the extraction with
   N, Ndimethylformamide was utilized. This extraction method can recover
   methyl orange adsorbed on the activated carbon. The results here
   demonstrated that in the absence of H2O2, microwave irradiation could
   not degrade methyl orange over the activated carbon, as opposed to other
   studies. In the presence of H2O2, both adsorption and degradation by
   H2O2 contributed to the removal of methyl orange over the activated
   carbon. The removal efficiencies were similar in microwave oven and on a
   hot plate. The extraction with N, N-dimethylformamide after H2O2
   treatment, provided the evidence that degradation of methyl orange by
   H2O2 can occur through the attack of dye molecules adsorbed on the
   activated carbon surface without their transfer to liquid phase. (C)

   evaluate the different WSN-based localization methods in real
   experimental environments. In addition, we propose a technique to
   minimize the computational cost while conserving the robustness of
   steered response power-based phase transition algorithm. It is shown
   here that the practical localization can be performed using real-life

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study a generalization of addition chains where kappa
   previous values are summed together on each step instead of only two
   values as in traditional addition chains. Such chains are called
   kappa-chains and we show that they have applications in finding
   efficient parallelizations in problems that are known to be difficult to
   parallelize. In particular, 3-chains improve computations of inversions
   in finite fields using hybrid-double multipliers. Recently, it was shown
   that this operation can be efficiently computed using a ternary
   algorithm but we show that 3-chains provide a significantly more
   efficient solution.}},

Abstract = {{The discrete cosine transform (DCT) is a widely-used and important
   signal processing tool employed in a plethora of applications. Typical
   fast algorithms for nearly-exact computation of DCT require floating
   point arithmetic, are multiplier intensive, and accumulate round-off
   errors. Recently proposed fast algorithm arithmetic cosine transform
   (ACT) calculates the DCT exactly using only additions and integer
   constant multiplications, with very low area complexity, for null mean
   input sequences. The ACT can also be computed non-exactly for any input
   sequence, with low area complexity and low power consumption, utilizing
   the novel architecture described. However, as a trade-off, the ACT
   algorithm requires 10 non-uniformly sampled data points to calculate the
   eight-point DCT. This requirement can easily be satisfied for
   applications dealing with spatial signals such as image sensors and
   biomedical sensor arrays, by placing sensor elements in a non-uniform
   grid. In this work, a hardware architecture for the computation of the
   null mean ACT is proposed, followed by a novel architectures that extend
   the ACT for non-null mean signals. All circuits are physically
   implemented and tested using the Xilinx XC6VLX240T FPGA device and
   synthesized for 45 nm TSMC standard-cell library for performance
   assessment.}},

Title = {{On the Impact of Intraluminal Thrombus Mechanical Behavior in AAA
   Passive Mechanics}},

Abstract = {{Intraluminal thrombus (ILT) is a pseudo-tissue that develops from
   coagulated blood, and is found in most abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs)
   of clinically relevant size. A number of studies have suggested that ILT
   mechanical characteristics may be related to AAA risk of rupture, even
   though there is still great controversy in this regard. ILT is isotropic
   and inhomogeneous and may appear as a soft (single-layered) or stiff
   (multilayered fibrotic) tissue. This paper aims to investigate how ILT
   constitution and topology influence the magnitude and location of peak
   wall stress (PWS). In total 21 patient-specific AAAs (diameter 4.2-5.4
   cm) were reconstructed from computer tomography images and
   biomechanically analyzed using state-of-the-art modeling assumptions.
   Results indicated that PWS correlated stronger with ILT volume (rho =
   0.44, p = 0.05) and minimum thickness of ILT layer (rho = 0.73, p =
   0.001) than with maximum AAA diameter (rho = 0.05, p = 0.82). On average
   PWS was 20\% (SD 12\%) higher for FE models that used soft instead of
   stiff ILT models (p < 0.001). PWS location strongly correlated with
   sites of minimum ILT thickness in the section of maximum AAA diameter
   and was independent from ILT stiffness. In addition, ILT heterogeneity,
   i.e., the spatial composition of soft and stiff thrombus tissue, can
   considerably influence stress in the AAA wall. The present study is
   limited to identification of influential biomechanical factors, and how
   its findings translate to an AAA rupture risk assessment remains to be
   explored by clinical studies.}},

Abstract = {{Multipath arises from the reception of reflected or diffracted signals
   in addition to the Line-Of-Sight (LOS) signal. By using a block
   processing high sensitivity receiver scheme, this paper aims to obtain
   better positioning performance in urban canyon areas. Generally, the
   peak with the most power is utilised in high sensitivity receivers;
   however, this approach is not always optimal in multipath environments.
   Noting that signal correlation peaks may be separated in the Doppler
   domain by a long coherent integration time, a peak identification scheme
   is proposed in this work, which yields better positioning performance.
   It is shown that most of the multipath peaks are removed in the receiver
   after using the proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we study adaptive stabilized mixed finite volume
   methods for the incompressible flows approximated using the lower order
   elements. A residual type of a posteriori error estimator is designed
   and studied with the derivation of upper and lower bounds between the
   exact solution and the finite volume solution. A discrete local lower
   bound between two successive finite volume solutions is also obtained.
   Also, convergence of the adaptive stabilized mixed finite volume methods
   is established. The presented methods have three prominent features.
   First, it is of practical convenience in real applications with the same
   partitions for velocity and pressure. Second, less computational time is
   required by easily applying both the lower order elements and the local
   grid refinement necessary for the elements of interest. Third, compared
   with the standard finite element method, its analysis of H-1-norm and
   L-2-norm for the velocity and pressure are usually derived without any
   high order regularity conditions on the exact solution. (c) 2015 Wiley

Abstract = {{Conductive nanofibers of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) filled with
   polyaniline (PANi)-coated multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were
   fabricated using the electrospinning technique. PANi is an intrinsically
   conductive polymer. The addition of PANi-coated MWCNTs to PVDF created
   short conductive strands on the surface of the nanofibers, facilitating
   the formation of a conductive network in the transverse direction of the
   nanofibers. Piezoelectricity along with electric conductivity makes
   these PVDF nanofibers promising for applications such as sensors and
   actuators. Electrospun PVDF nanofiber mats had higher piezoelectricity
   than melt-processed samples produced using traditional polymer
   processing techniques, such as compression molding. Spectroscopic
   imaging techniques were employed to study the effects of the filler and
   processing conditions on the nanofiber structure. X-ray diffraction,
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning
   calorimetry results indicated a large increase in the -phase crystals of
   the PVDF nanofibers. This higher content of -phase crystals enhanced the

Abstract = {{Background: The external knee adduction moment (EKAM) is often studied
   in knee osteoarthritis research. This study compared EKAMs between two
   methods of calculation: a method that only requires ground reaction
   force and knee position data (i.e. lever-arm), and an inverse dynamics
   link-segment method.
   Methods: Sixteen participants walked while wearing a control shoe with
   and without a six millimeter lateral wedge insole. Peak EKAMs between
   the lever-arm and inverse dynamics methods were compared for the control
   condition, and the \%change in moment induced by the lateral wedge was
   compared between methods.
   Results: When comparing EKAMs between methods, no correlation was found
   (r = 0.24, p = 0.36); peak EKAMs with the lever-arm method (26.0 Nm)
   were significantly lower than EKAMs with the inverse dynamics method
   (40.2 Nm, p b 0.001); and Bland-Altman plots showed poor agreement
   between methods. When assessing the \%change in moment with a lateral
   wedge, a moderate correlation was found (r = 0.55, p = 0.03) between
   methods; Bland-Altman plots showed moderate agreement between methods;
   and the lever-arm method (-6.4\%) was not significantly different from
   the inverse dynamics method (-11.4\%, p = 0.09); however, the two
   methods produced opposite results 31\% of the time.
   Conclusion: The lever-arm method cannot estimate peak EKAMs, and can
   only approximate the \%change in moment induced by a lateral wedge;
   however, the error rate was 31\%. Therefore, the lever-arm method is not
   recommended for use in its current form. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

   wireless localization, relative to being widely used non-pulse-shaping
   pseudorandom noise (NPS PN) transmission in current satellite-and

   accuracy, the required NDB OFDM transmit energy is proven in this paper
   to be equal to 30\% of the required NPS PN transmit energy, spending
   less nonrenewable resource, emitting smaller CO2 and indicating a
   ``green{''} activity. Furthermore, the localization performance and the
   optimal network topology for obtaining the best accuracy are
   mathematically derived. By assuming a positioning system with the
   proposed optimal network topology, the positioning accuracy is derived,
   and the total energy saving is reported when using NDB OFDM transmission
   instead of NPS PN transmission. Numerical results and experimental
   measurements both show a consistency with our proposed theory.}},

Abstract = {{The precipitation and deposition of asphaltenes is a primary problem
   related to the processing, transportation, and production of oil.
   Flocculation of asphaltene aggregates is likely to occur during the
   production and processing of crude oil. Recently, it has been shown that
   nanotechnology in the form of nanopartides is useful for the inhibition
   or prevention of asphaltene formation damage. Although it is well-known
   that the adsorption of asphaltenes on the nanopartide surface would
   reduce the capacity of these asphaltic compounds to interact with each
   other, limited studies have been performed regarding the processes and
   the mechanisms associated with the effect of nanopartides on the
   inhibition of the formation damage due to asphaltenes. To better
   understand this phenomenon from a mathematical approach, a population
   balance model (PBM) is proposed to describe the kinetics of asphaltene
   flocculation-fragmentation in the presence of nanoparticles. The model
   assumes that asphaltenes in the presence of a shear rate are related to
   the aggregation and fragmentation phenomena and includes a term related
   to the asphaltene adsorption on nanopartides. An adsorption kinetic term
   was introduced into the model using the double exponential model.
   Experimental data of the kinetics of asphaltene aggregation were
   obtained by dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements at a fixed
   initial asphaltene concentration of 1000 mg/L and with different Heptol
   mixtures. In this study, commercial silica, gamma-alumina, and magnetite
   nanoparticles were used as adsorbents to study the effect of the
   chemical nature of the nanopartides on the inhibition of the asphaltene
   growth and for model validation. Additionally, to demonstrate the
   versatility of the proposed model, the effect of asphaltene was also
   evaluated. The obtained results from the proposed population balance
   model agree well with the experimental data, within an RSME \% < 9\%.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrogen-doped and undoped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were synthesized by
   selective passing of source and carrier gases (ethane, ammonia,
   hydrogen, and argon) over an alumina-supported iron catalyst in a quartz
   tubular reactor at 650 degrees C. Synthesized CNTs were mixed with
   polyvinylidene fluoride with an Alberta polymer asymmetric minimixer
   (APAM) mixer at 240 degrees C and 235 rpm, and the resulting
   nanocomposites were compression molded. Transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM), Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, and
   thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) techniques revealed that introducing
   nitrogen into the crystalline structure of CNTs resulted in higher
   crystalline defects. Dielectric measurements showed that nitrogen doping
   significantly increased dielectric permittivity for a known dielectric
   loss. This was ascribed to the role of the crystalline defects and
   nitrogen atoms, which acted as polarizing centers, blocked the nomadic
   charges, polarized them, and prevented them from moving along CNTs. The
   obtained results introduce nitrogen doping as a regulative tool to
   control the dielectric properties of CNT/polymer nanocomposites.}},

Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Application of nanotechnology in drilling fluids for the oil and gas
   industry has been a focus of several recent studies. A process for the
   in situ synthesis of nanoparticles (NPs) into drilling fluids has been
   developed previously in our group and showed that calcium-based NPs
   (CNPs) and iron-based NPs (INPs), respectively, with concentrations of
   0.5-2.0 wt\% can dramatically improve filtration properties of
   commercial drilling fluids in a laboratory environment. In this work, a
   modified process for the emulsion-based synthesis of NPs on a 20 m(3)
   volume and its subsequent full-scale field testing are presented.
   Comparison between NP carrier fluids prepared under controlled
   environment in the laboratory and those prepared on a large scale in a
   mixing facility revealed very little variation in the main
   characteristics of the drilling fluid; including the size of the solid
   constituents. Transmission electron microscopy photographs suggest an
   average CNP particle size in the carrier fluid of 51 +/- 11 nm. Results
   from the full-scale field test showed that total mud losses while
   drilling with CNP-based invert emulsion were on average 27 \% lower than
   in the case of conventional fluids. This loss prevention falls within
   the range observed in the laboratory.}},

   Steam Cracking of toluene}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},

Volume = {{154}},
Pages = {{71-79}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{A family of nickel based mixed oxides was synthesized, characterized and
   tested in the CSC of Toluene. A rhodium based catalyst was also studied
   as a reference. The mixed oxide catalysts were prepared by the
   precipitation method used in the synthesis of hydrotalcite type solids
   and characterized by XRD, N-2 adsorption-desorption for textural
   properties, EDX-Field Emission Microscopy and XPS. The reference
   catalyst was prepared using the successive wetness impregnation method
   supported on gamma-Al2O3. Successful substitution of Mg2+ by Ni2+ and
   that of Al3+ by Fe3+ was evidenced by XRD as the characteristic seven
   signals of the hydrotalcite are present in the diffractograms. All
   signals are slightly shifted which implies a modification on the cell
   parameters caused by the replacements of the cations within the
   structure. When Ce3+ was used in the synthesis a small proportion formed
   part of a hydrotalcite structure. However, most of it precipitated
   forming nano domains of CeO2. The hydrotalcite type nickel formulation
   MgNiAl and MgNiFeAl presented a poor catalytic activity as compared with
   the MgNiCeAl and reference catalysts. The addition of Ce seems to
   improve the surface properties of the catalyst and enhance the reaction
   performance of MgNiAl by increasing its resistance to carbon deposition.
   The steady state conversion of the reference rhodium catalyst at high
   temperature is in the same order of magnitude of that obtained with the
   MgNiCeAl formulation. However, MgNiCeAl shows higher conversion at lower
   temperatures. The presence of nanoparticles of cerium seems to be
   responsible for the observed results. Additionally, a high hydrogen
   yield was obtained. This result implies that the main reaction involved
   under the reaction conditions studied is steam reforming. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{While new technologies are being developed for extracting unconventional
   oil, in the near term economic benefits and footprint reduction can be
   achieved by enhancing the energy efficiency of existing facilities. The
   objective of this work is to evaluate energy efficiency opportunities
   for in situ extraction of Canada's oil sands resource using pinch
   analysis. Modifications to an original plant design are analyzed in
   order to estimate utility savings beyond those obtained for the initial
   process configuration. The modifications explored in this paper are
   estimated to deliver energy savings of up to 6\% beyond `business as
   usual'. This corresponds to GHG emissions reduction of approximately
   5\%. However, in some cases, this increase in energy savings comes at
   the cost of increasing demand for make-up water and volume of disposal
   water. Surplus generation of steam beyond heating requirements in the
   water treatment system leads to energy inefficiencies. Additional cost
   and energy savings are obtained by reducing or eliminating the use of
   glycol in the cooling circuit. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

   superior both OLS and LSR regression methods in terms of R-2 statistics
   and relative error rate. Applications of MixReg, on both simulated and
   real data, show that MixReg method outperforms both OLS and LSR

Abstract = {{A concurrent-hybrid non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (hybrid
   NSGA-II) has been developed and applied to the simultaneous optimization
   of the annual energy production, flapwise root-bending moment and mass
   of the NREL 5MW wind-turbine blade. By hybridizing a multi-objective
   evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) with gradient-based local search, it is
   believed that the optimal set of blade designs could be achieved in
   lower computational cost than for a conventional MOEA. To measure the
   convergence between the hybrid and non-hybrid NSGA-II on a wind-turbine
   blade optimization problem, a computationally intensive case was
   performed using the non-hybrid NSGA-II. From this particular case, a
   three-dimensional surface representing the optimal trade-off between the
   annual energy production, flapwise root-bending moment and blade mass
   was achieved. The inclusion of local gradients in the blade
   optimization, however, shows no improvement in the convergence for this
   three-objective problem.}},

Title = {{An Analytical Model for Analyzing and Forecasting Production From

Abstract = {{Analytical methods for analyzing and forecasting production from
   multifractured horizontal wells completed in unconventional reservoirs
   are in their infancy. Among the difficulties in modeling such systems is
   the incorporation of fracture-network complexity as a result of the
   hydraulic-fracturing process. Along with a primary
   propped-hydraulic-fracture network, a secondary fracture network, which
   may or may not contain proppant, may be activated during the stimulation
   process, creating a ``branched-fracture{''} network. These secondary
   fractures can be the result of reactivation of healed natural fractures,
   for example.
   In the current work, we develop a fully analytical
   enhanced-fracture-region (EFR) model for analyzing and forecasting
   multifractured horizontal wells with complex fracture geometry that is
   more-general, -rigorous, and -flexible than those previously developed.
   Specifically, our new model allows nonsymmetric placement of a well
   within its area of drainage, to reflect unequal horizontal-lateral
   spacing; this is a very real scenario observed in the field,
   particularly for the external laterals on a pad. The solutions also can
   be reduced to be applicable for homogeneous systems without branch
   fractures. In addition to the general EFR solution, we have provided
   local solutions that can be used to analyze individual flow regimes in
   sequence. We provide practical examples of the application (and
   sometimes misapplication) of local solutions by use of simulated and
   field cases. One important observation is that a negative intercept
   obtained from a straight line drawn through data on a
   square-root-of-time plot (commonly used to analyze transient linear
   flow) may indicate EFR behavior, but this straight line should not be
   interpreted as linear flow because it represents transitional flow from
   one linear-flow period to another.
   Our general EFR solution therefore provides a powerful tool to improve
   both forecasting and flow-regime interpretation for
   hydraulic-fracture/reservoir characterization.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the measurements of bitumen thermophysical
   properties (density and viscosity) over a wide range of temperatures
   (ambient to 200 degrees C) and pressures (atmospheric to 14 MPa). The
   measurements have been conducted on three Athabasca bitumen samples
   taken from different locations. A new method was proposed to correlate
   the density data as a function of temperature and pressure, with a
   maximum absolute deviation of 1.7 kg/m(3). The viscosity data were also
   correlated with two correlations available in literature considering the
   effect of pressure and temperature on viscosity of bitumen, with an
   average absolute relative deviation of 9.2\%. The measured data and
   correlations are applicable for the prediction and optimization of oil
   recovery in the solvent-and thermal-based bitumen-recovery processes
   such as expanding-solvent steam assisted gravity drainage (ES-SAGD) and

Abstract = {{The influence of a resistive load on the starting performance of a
   standing-wave thermoacoustic engine is investigated numerically. The
   model used is based upon a low Mach number assumption; it couples the
   two-dimensional nonlinear flow and heat exchange within the
   thermoacoustic active cell with one-dimensional linear acoustics in the
   loaded resonator. For a given engine geometry, prescribed temperatures
   at the heat exchangers, prescribed mean pressure, and prescribed load,
   results from a simulation in the time domain include the evolution of
   the acoustic pressure in the active cell. That signal is then analyzed,
   extracting growth rate and frequency of the dominant modes. For a given
   load, the temperature difference between the two sides is then varied;
   the most unstable mode is identified and so is the corresponding
   critical temperature ratio between heater and cooler. Next, varying the
   load, a stability diagram is obtained, potentially with a predictive
   value. Results are compared with those derived from Rott's linear theory
   as well as with experimental results found in the literature. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The Velodyne LiDAR series is one of the most popular spinning beam LiDAR
   systems currently available on the market. In this paper, the temporal
   stability of the range measurements of the Velodyne HDL-32E LiDAR system
   is first investigated as motivation for the development of a new
   automatic calibration method that allows quick and frequent recovery of
   the inherent time-varying errors. The basic principle of the method is
   that the LiDAR's internal systematic error parameters are estimated by
   constraining point clouds of some known and automatically detected
   cylindrical features such as lamp poles to fit to the 3D cylinder
   models. This is analogous to the plumb-line calibration method in which
   the lens distortion parameters are estimated by constraining the image
   points of straight lines to fit to the 2D line model. The calibration
   can be performed at every measurement epoch in both static and kinematic
   modes. Four real datasets were used to verify the method, two of which
   were captured in static mode and the other two in kinematic mode. The
   overall results indicate that up to approximately 72\% and 41\% accuracy
   improvement were realized as a result of the calibration for the static
   and kinematic datasets, respectively.}},

Title = {{Impacts of real-time satellite clock errors on GPS precise point
   positioning-based troposphere zenith delay estimation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEODESY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Global Positioning System (GPS) has become a cost-effective tool to
   determine troposphere zenith total delay (ZTD) with accuracy comparable
   to other atmospheric sensors such as the radiosonde, the water vapor
   radiometer, the radio occultation and so on. However, the high accuracy
   of GPS troposphere ZTD estimates relies on the precise satellite orbit
   and clock products available with various latencies. Although the
   International GNSS Service (IGS) can provide predicted orbit and clock
   products for real-time applications, the predicted clock accuracy of 3
   ns cannot always guarantee the high accuracy of troposphere ZTD
   estimates. Such limitations could be overcome by the use of the newly
   launched IGS real-time service which provides 5 cm orbit and 0.2-1.0 ns
   (an equivalent range error of 6-30 cm) clock products in real time.
   Considering the relatively larger magnitude of the clock error than that
   of the orbit error, this paper investigates the effect of real-time
   satellite clock errors on the GPS precise point positioning (PPP)-based
   troposphere ZTD estimation. Meanwhile, how the real-time satellite clock
   errors impact the GPS PPP-based troposphere ZTD estimation has also been
   studied to obtain the most precise ZTD solutions. First, two types of
   real-time satellite clock products are assessed with respect to the IGS
   final clock product in terms of accuracy and precision. Second, the
   real-time GPS PPP-based troposphere ZTD estimation is conducted using
   data from 34 selected IGS stations over three independent weeks in
   April, July and October, 2013. Numerical results demonstrate that the
   precision, rather than the accuracy, of the real-time satellite clock
   products impacts the real-time PPP-based ZTD solutions more
   significantly. In other words, the real-time satellite clock product
   with better precision leads to more precise real-time PPP-based
   troposphere ZTD solutions. Therefore, it is suggested that users should
   select and apply real-time satellite products with better clock
   precision to obtain more consistent real-time PPP-based ZTD solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Measurement of femtoscale displacements in the ultrasonic frequency
   range is attractive for advanced material characterization and sensing,
   yet major challenges remain in their reliable transduction using
   non-optical modalities, which can dramatically reduce the size and
   complexity of the transducer assembly. Here we demonstrate femtoscale
   displacement transduction using an AlGaN/GaN heterojunction field effect
   transistor-integrated GaN microcantilever that utilizes piezoelectric
   polarization-induced changes in two-dimensional electron gas to
   transduce displacement with very high sensitivity. The piezotransistor
   demonstrated an ultra-high gauge factor of 8,700 while consuming an
   extremely low power of 1.36 nW, and transduced external excitation with
   a superior noise-limited resolution of 12.43 fm Hz(-1/2) and an
   outstanding responsivity of 170 nV fm(-1), which is comparable to the
   optical transduction limits. These extraordinary characteristics, which
   enabled unique detection of nanogram quantity of analytes using
   photoacoustic spectroscopy, can be readily exploited in realizing a
   multitude of novel sensing paradigms.}},

Abstract = {{The application of solvent injection for heavy oil and bitumen recovery
   processes requires the predictions of the performance for a field-scale
   design. This directly depends upon the variation of oil properties by
   solvent dilution. Thus, the comparison and evaluation of the solvent
   effects on the density and viscosity of oil are crucial. In this study,
   a constant number of solvent moles is dissolved in 1 mol of bitumen at a
   constant temperature and pressure and the thermophysical properties of
   mixtures are measured. Different solvents, methane, ethane, propane,
   butane, and carbon dioxide, are considered for the measurements. The
   measurements are taken at temperatures varying from 323 to 463 K,
   pressures of 4, 6, 8, and 10 MPa, and mixtures with different mole
   percentages of the solvents (5, 10, and 15). The results indicate that,
   at a constant temperature, pressure, and solvent mole fraction, the
   undersaturated carbon dioxide/bitumen mixture has the highest density
   and the undersaturated butane/bitumen mixture has the lowest density.
   Among the hydrocarbon gases, a general slight decreasing trend of
   undersaturated bitumen density with carbon number is observed. Finally,
   the mixture densities are predicted with an effective liquid density
   approach with a maximum average absolute relative deviation (AARD) of
   0.17\%.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces an analytical model for characterizing the
   instantaneous hit ratio and instantaneous average hit distance of a
   traditional least recently used (LRU) cache hierarchy. The analysis
   accounts for the use of two variants of the Time-to-Live (TTL) weak

   in the HTTP/1.1 protocol where expired objects are refreshed using
   conditional GET requests. The second is TTL immediate ejection (TTL-IE)
   where objects are ejected as soon as they expire. The analysis also
   accounts for two sharing protocols: Leave Copy Everywhere (LCE) and
   Promote Cached Objects (PCO). PCO is a new sharing protocol introduced
   in this paper that decreases the user's perceived latency and is robust
   under nonstationary access patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic knee joint function requires coordinated multi-muscle activation
   patterns (MMP) that may be adversely affected by total knee arthroplasty
   (TKA). This study identified MMP changes in post-operative female TKA
   patients using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). It was hypothesised that
   TKA patients can successfully be classified and display significant
   alterations in temporal and spectral muscle activation characteristics.
   19 female subjects (10 unilateral gender-specific TKA, 62.2 +/- 8.6 yrs,
   BMI 28.2 +/- 5.4; and 9 healthy controls, 61.4 +/- 7.4 yrs, BMI 25.6 +/-
   2.4) were recruited. Surface electromyograms (EMG) were obtained for 7
   lower limb muscles during walking. Stance phase (+/- 30\%) EMG data were
   processed using a wavelet transform and normalized to total power. Data
   across all muscles were combined to form MMPs and analyzed using a SVM.
   Recognition rates for all subjects were computed for MMPs and individual
   muscles. A binomial test was used to establish statistical significance
   (p < 0.05). The results supported the hypothesis indicating
   significantly altered muscle activations for vastus medialis
   (recognition rate similar to 68.4\%) and biceps femoris (recognition
   rate similar to 73.7\%). Further analysis identified distinct between
   group differences across temporal, spectral and intensity domains.
   Application of a combined SVM and MMP approach may be beneficial for the
   future assessment of post-surgical dynamic muscle function. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a partitioned distortion mitigation technique for
   both the transmitter and receiver sides of a radio link. The proposed
   method compensates for the phase nonlinearity at the transmitter side
   using phase digital predistortion (DPD) and mitigates the amplitude
   nonlinearity at the receiver side by analyzing the cumulative
   distribution function of the received signal. The channel effects are
   also considered and are equalized before the amplitude nonlinearity
   compensation in the receiver. The performance of the distributed
   distortion compensation technique is compared, in terms of error vector
   magnitude (EVM), adjacent channel power ratio, and power efficiency
   (PE), with current DPD methods. Measurement results show that the
   proposed partitioned distortion mitigation approach provided an EVM of
   1.1\% for long-term evolution signals, compared to 2.4\% for the
   conventional power back-off (BO), 2.9\% for overdriven digital
   predistortion (OD-DPD), and 0.48\% for complex DPD techniques. The PE
   significantly improved from 15.8\% and 17.9\% for the conventional BO
   and OD-DPD, respectively, to 23\% using the proposed method. The bit
   error rate values at the receiver for the proposed method compare
   favorably with those of the DPD and phase-only DPD methods.}},

Abstract = {{Overload has been suggested as a contributing factor for bone loss, for
   instance at the bone implant interface. The objective of this study is
   to investigate spongy bone resorption under overload using a
   semi-mechanistic bone remodeling theory. Since overload can cause the
   accumulation of microdamage in bone, in this study, it is assumed that
   overload will increase the osteoclastic activity, and also will reduce
   the osteocyte influence distance. First, a previously proposed
   semi-mechanistic bone remodeling theory was extended by defining a new
   form for the resorption probability function, which is based on
   experimental evidence. Then, in order to investigate the validity of our
   hypothesis, a three-dimensional finite element model of spongy bone was
   developed. The simulation results show that, first, trabeculae adapt
   with the mechanical stimuli placed on them. Secondly, a sharp reduction
   in spongy bone density will be resulted, in agreement with experimental
   evidence, when bone is under overload.}},

Abstract = {{As an abstraction of natural samara flight, steadily rotating plates in
   a free-stream flow have been studied. Particle image velocimetry on
   span-normal planes has been conducted to show that increasing rotation,
   as captured by the dimensionless parameter of tip speed ratio, causes a
   transition of the mean wake topology from that of a bluff body to that
   of a stable leading-edge vortex. Despite its notable effect on topology,
   a change in tip speed ratio has negligible effect on leading-edge
   circulation at a given spanwise position, local effective angle of
   attack and local effective velocity. The effective angle-of-attack
   distribution was held constant at different tip speed ratios by
   comparing rotating plates with different twist profiles. The shear-layer
   velocity profile at the leading edge was also resolved, allowing
   quantification of the vorticity flux passing through the leading-edge
   shear layer. Interestingly, the observed equilibrium values of
   circulation are not sensitive to changes in shear-layer vorticity flux.}},

Abstract = {{The present work involves the preparation of novel adsorbent materials
   by the insolubilization and hybridization of humic acid (HA) with
   carbon. The prepared materials were characterized by N-2 adsorption,
   elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning
   electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, solid-state C-13
   cross polarization magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance, and
   low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry on wetted
   samples. The water solubility of these materials and the lack of effect
   of oxidants were also confirmed. With this background, the adsorption
   capacities toward phenol, 2,4,6-tricholrophenol, and atrazine were
   evaluated, using these as model compounds for organic micropollutants of
   concern in water. Experimental results show that the prepared materials
   are mesoporous and have a higher surface area than humic acid and even
   than the porous carbon in the case of carbon coating. They retain the
   basic features of the starting materials with lowered functional group
   content. Moreover, there are interesting new features. NMR relaxometry
   shows that equilibration of water uptake is very fast, making use in
   water simple. They have higher adsorption capacities than the pure
   materials, and they can be applied under a wide range of environmental
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an inductorless 0.13-mu m CMOS TIA structure that is
   a modified version of a regulated cascode (RGC) TIA. An immittance
   converter is incorporated to reduce power consumption while increasing
   transimpedance gain. Measured 3-dB bandwidth is 7 GHz, sufficient for
   10-Gb/s operation, in the presence of 250 fF capacitance at the TIA
   input, representative of typical CMOS photodiode capacitance. The
   transimpedance gain of the single-stage TIA is 50 dB Omega, and the
   group-delay variation is less than +/- 19 ps over the 3-dB bandwidth.
   The circuit occupies an active area of 180 mu m x 90 mu m and consumes 7
   mW from a 1.5-V supply. The measured average input-referred current
   noise of the TIA is 31 pA/root Hz. Simulations and analysis show that
   the proposed single-stage TIA architecture is capable of achieving
   improvement in the transimpedance limit over a single-stage RGC TIA
   designed for the same data rate and the same input photodiode
   capacitance. A comparison of measurement results to published TIAs also
   demonstrates the competitive performance of the proposed TIA in terms of
   the TIA transimpendance gain, band-width, area, and power consumption.}},

Title = {{Time-dependent damage in predictions of fatigue behaviour of normal and

Volume = {{19}},

Pages = {{335-349}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Ligaments are dense fibrous tissues that connect bones across a joint
   and are exposed daily to creep and fatigue loading. Ligaments are
   tensile load-bearing tissues; therefore, fatigue loading will have a
   component of time-dependent damage from the non-zero mean stress and
   cycle-dependent damage from the oscillating stress. If time-dependent
   damage is not sufficient to completely predict the fatigue response,
   then cycle-dependent damage could be an important contributor. Using
   data from normal ligaments (current study and Thornton et al., Clin.
   Biomech. 22:932-940, 2007a) and healing ligaments (Thornton and Bailey,
   J. Biomech. Eng. 135:091004-1-091004-6, 2013), creep data was used to
   predict the fatigue response considering time-dependent damage.
   Relationships between creep lifetime and test stress or initial strain
   were modelled using exponential or power-law regression. In order to
   predict fatigue lifetimes, constant rates of damage were assumed and
   time-varying stresses were introduced into the expressions for
   time-dependent damage from creep. Then, the predictions of fatigue
   lifetime were compared with curvefits to the fatigue data where
   exponential or power-law regressions were used to determine the
   relationship between fatigue lifetime and test stress or initial strain.
   The fatigue prediction based on time-dependent damage alone greatly
   overestimated fatigue lifetime suggesting that time-dependent damage
   alone cannot account for all of the damage accumulated during fatigue
   and that cycle-dependent damage has an important role. At lower stress
   and strain, time-dependent damage was a greater relative contributor for
   normal ligaments than healing ligaments; however, cycle-dependent damage
   was a greater relative contributor with incremental increases in stress
   or strain for normal ligaments than healing ligaments.}},

Abstract = {{Wall stress is a powerful tool to assist clinical decisions in rupture
   risk assessment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Key modeling assumptions
   that influence wall stress magnitude and distribution are the inclusion
   or exclusion of the intraluminal thrombus in the model and the
   assumption of a uniform wall thickness. We employed a combined
   numerical-experimental approach to test the hypothesis that abdominal
   aortic aneurysm (AAA) wall tissues with different thickness as well as
   wall tissues covered by different thrombus thickness, exhibit
   differences in the mechanical behavior. Ultimate tissue strength was
   measured from in vitro tensile testing of AAA specimens and material
   properties of the wall were estimated by fitting the results of the
   tensile tests to a histo-mechanical constitutive model. Results showed a
   decrease in tissue strength and collagen stiffness with increasing wall
   thickness, supporting the hypothesis of wall thickening being mediated
   by accumulation of non load-bearing components. Additionally, an
   increase in thrombus deposition resulted in a reduction of elastin
   content, collagen stiffness and tissue strength. Local wall thickness
   and thrombus coverage may be used as surrogate measures of local
   mechanical properties of the tissue, and therefore, are possible
   candidates to improve the specificity of AAA wall stress and rupture
   risk evaluations.}},

Abstract = {{To determine whether inflammation following anterior cruciate ligament
   (ACL) reconstruction leads to long-term pathological changes in the
   infrapatellar fat pad (IPFP or Hoffa's fat pad) which could compromise

   Sixteen mature sheep underwent anatomic idealized ACL reconstruction
   surgery (ACL-R) and were sacrificed at 2 weeks (n = 9) and 20 weeks (n =
   7) post-ACL-R. Five additional animals served as unoperated controls. A
   histological grading protocol was developed to quantify the changes in
   the IPFP post-injury. mRNA expression levels for key markers of
   inflammation, angiogenesis and tissue regeneration were assessed by
   qPCR.
   The IPFP exhibited altered cellularity and fibrosis at 2 and 20 weeks
   post-ACL-R. Immunohistochemistry detected macrophage-like cells in the
   IPFP which were increased at 20 weeks. Specific pro-inflammatory
   cytokines and IPFP specific adipokines exhibited changes indicating
   early inflammation mediated alterations. Elevations in CD105 mRNA levels
   at 2 weeks corroborated the increases in neovascularization observed in
   the IPFP following injury.
   Sustained long-term pathological changes stemming from inflammation are
   present in IPFP tissue after ACL-R surgery and may compromise the
   long-term integrity of the knee joint.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the nature of the impacts of walking distances and
   waiting time on transit use. The relative trade-offs of walking and

   of observations was 2694. This data set was used to estimate the
   coefficients in different utility functions using a random parameters
   logit model. The results demonstrated that walking distances to and from
   transit stops have important and significant nonlinear negative
   influences on the attractiveness of transit. Transfer waiting time was
   also shown to have a significant nonlinear negative impact on transit
   attractiveness. The random parameters logit model had a better model fit
   than the standard logit model. Some of the findings obtained here are
   novel, while others are consistent with previous works. These findings

Abstract = {{Miscible displacements in homogeneous porous media are investigated
   through numerical simulations for cyclic time-dependent velocities
   considering inertial effects. It is found that the velocity's models,
   cycle period, and amplitude have significant impacts on the flow,
   however the effects greatly depend on whether inertia is considered or
   not. Generally, cyclic extraction-injection (E/I) processes are always
   less unstable than constant injection and their injection-extraction
   (I/E) counterpart, regardless of the strength of inertia. Instabilities
   of E/I processes are reduced as the velocity period or amplitude
   increases, and these attenuating effects increase with the Reynolds
   number. However, in the case of I/E processes, the effects of the period
   and the amplitude are strongly dependent on inertia. For non-inertial
   cases, larger periods or amplitudes lead to more unstable flows, while
   for their inertial counterparts, the effects are found to be
   non-monotonic. In particular, as the period increases, instabilities
   first decrease and then increase. A period-stabilizing range is
   identified in which the displacements of the time-dependent injection
   velocities are actually less unstable than those of the constant
   injection flow. When the period is further increased to the
   period-destabilizing range, the flows tend to become more unstable.
   Moreover, the velocity amplitude can attenuate or enhance the
   instabilities depending on whether the period is within the
   period-stabilizing or period-destabilizing range. Furthermore, stronger
   inertial effects are found to greatly reduce the instabilities and to
   expand the period-stabilizing range.}},

Title = {{An evaluation of enhanced oil recovery strategies for a heavy oil

Abstract = {{Cold heavy oil production with sand (CHOPS) is the process of choice for
   unconsolidated heavy oil reservoirs with relatively high gas content.
   The key challenge of CHOPS is that the recovery factor tends to be
   between 5\% and 15\%, implying that the majority of the oil remains in
   the ground after the process is rendered uneconomic. Continued cold
   production (without sands) is not productive for a post-CHOPS reservoir
   because of the low oil saturation and depleted reservoir pressure in the
   wormhole regions. There is a need to develop viable recovery processes
   for post-CHOPS reservoirs. Here, different follow-up processes are
   examined for a post-CHOPS heavy oil reservoir. In post-CHOPS cold water
   flooding, severe water channeling is ineffective at displacing high
   viscosity heavy oil. Hot water flooding improves the sweep efficiency
   and produces more oil compared with cold water flooding. However, the
   swept region is limited to the domain between the neighboring wormhole
   networks, and the energy efficiency of the process is relatively poor.
   Compared with the hot water flooding case, steam flooding achieves
   higher oil production rates and lower water use. A cyclic steam
   stimulation strategy achieves the best performance regarding oil
   production rates and water usage. Based on our results, it is observed
   that thermally based techniques alone are not capable to recover the oil
   economically for post-CHOPS reservoirs. However, it is suggested that
   techniques with combined use of thermal energy and solvent could
   potentially yield efficient oil recovery methods for these reservoirs.

Abstract = {{Characterization of bitumen is a necessary step to perform phase
   equilibrium computations involved in bitumen production and processing.
   This study presents a methodology for bitumen characterization using a
   residue curve map. A fugacity-activity coefficient approach is applied
   to model the thermodynamic equilibrium of the species in the gas and
   liquid phases. The Peng-Robinson equation of state (PR-EoS) and NRTL
   activity model are utilized to calculate the fugacity and activity
   coefficients in the gas and liquid phases, respectively. The proposed
   model was evaluated using experimental simulated distillation (SD) data
   as well as experimental solubility data of light hydrocarbon (CH4, C2H6)
   and non-hydrocarbon gases (CO2, N-2) in bitumen. The molecular weight,
   specific gravity, and SD curves were represented using defined
   pseudo-components. The tuned EoS was able to regenerate the solubility
   data with an acceptable accuracy (AARD less than 5.6\% and 4.5\% for
   hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon solvents, respectively). The proposed
   method can be applied for bitumen characterization and to predict the
   solubility of the light gases in bitumen. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{On hot water flooding strategies for thin heavy oil reservoirs}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{153}},
Pages = {{559-568}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Cold production methods for heavy oil resources in Western Canada yield
   recovery factors averaging about 10\% and as yet, there are no
   commercially successful technologies to produce oil from these
   reservoirs with recovery factor greater than 20\%. This means that the
   majority of oil remains in the reservoir. The objective of this study is
   to determine technically and economically feasible recovery processes
   for thin heavy oil reservoirs by using a simulated annealing algorithm.
   The results reveal that high injection pressure is critical to a
   successful hot water flooding strategy. Also, they show from a thermal
   efficiency point of view that it is most efficient to adopt an injection
   temperature profile where the injection temperature starts high earlier
   in the process and ends at lower water temperature. The lower
   temperature injection at later stages of the recovery process partially
   recovers the heat stored in the reservoir matrix and therefore increases
   the overall heat utilization efficiency. A sensitivity analysis shows
   that the permeability distribution affects the performance of the hot
   water flooding process most significantly. The existence of a higher
   permeability zone in the lower part of the reservoir leads to earlier
   oil production and water breakthrough. High permeability was found to
   lead to more oil and water production in the early stage of operation
   and achieved the best economic performance. The low permeability case
   exhibited relatively low oil production volume. Although it has the
   lowest cumulative injected energy to oil produced ratio, poor oil
   production renders the operation process uneconomic. Given the volume of
   currently inaccessible thin heavy oil resources, the optimized
   strategies developed here provide important guidelines to convert these
   resources to producible reserves. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Altering Knee Abduction Angular Impulse Using Wedged Insoles for
   Treatment of Patellofemoral Pain in Runners: A Six-Week Randomized
   Controlled Trial}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 31}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   Determine if a change in internal knee abduction angular impulse (KAAI)
   is related to pain reduction for runners with patellofemoral pain (PFP)
   by comparing lateral and medial wedge insole interventions, and
   increased KAAI and decreased KAAI groups.
   Design
   Randomized controlled clinical trial (ClinicalTrials. gov ID\#
   NCT01332110).
   Setting
   Biomechanics laboratory and community.
   Patients
   Thirty-six runners with physician-diagnosed PFP enrolled in the trial,
   and 27 were analyzed.
   Interventions
   Runners with PFP were randomly assigned to either an experimental 3 mm
   lateral wedge or control 6 mm medial wedge group. Participants completed
   a biomechanical gait analysis to quantify KAAIs with their assigned
   insole, and then used their assigned insole for six-weeks during their
   regular runs. Usual pain during running was measured at baseline and at
   six-week follow-up using a visual analog scale. Statistical tests were
   performed to identify differences between wedge types, differences
   between biomechanical response types (i.e. increase or decrease KAAI),
   as well as predictors of pain reduction.
   Main Outcome Measures
   Percent change in KAAI relative to neutral, and \% change in pain over
   six weeks.
   Results
   Clinically meaningful reductions in pain (>33\%) were measured for both
   footwear groups; however, no significant differences between footwear
   groups were found (p = 0.697). When participants were regrouped based on
   KAAI change (i.e., increase or decrease), again, no significant
   differences in pain reduction were noted (p = 0.146). Interestingly,
   when evaluating absolute change in KAAI, a significant relationship
   between absolute\% change in KAAI and \% pain reduction was observed
   (R-2 = 0.21; p = 0.030), after adjusting for baseline pain levels.
   Conclusion
   The greater the absolute \% change in KAAI during running, the greater
   the \% reduction in pain over six weeks, regardless of wedge type, and
   whether KAAIs increased or decreased. Lateral and medial wedge insoles
   were similar in effectiveness for treatment of PFP.}},

Title = {{Do hypoxia/normoxia culturing conditions change the neuroregulatory
   profile of Wharton Jelly mesenchymal stem cell secretome?}},
Journal = {{STEM CELL RESEARCH \& THERAPY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUL 24}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: The use of human umbilical cord Wharton Jelly-derived
   mesenchymal stem cells (hWJ-MSCs) has been considered a new potential
   source for future safe applications in regenerative medicine. Indeed,
   the application of hWJ-MSCs into different animal models of disease,
   including those from the central nervous system, has shown remarkable
   therapeutic benefits mostly associated with their secretome.
   Conventionally, hWJ-MSCs are cultured and characterized under normoxic
   conditions (21 \% oxygen tension), although the oxygen levels within
   tissues are typically much lower (hypoxic) than these standard culture
   conditions. Therefore, oxygen tension represents an important
   environmental factor that may affect the performance of mesenchymal stem
   cells in vivo. However, the impact of hypoxic conditions on distinct
   mesenchymal stem cell characteristics, such as the secretome, still
   remains unclear.
   Methods: In the present study, we have examined the effects of normoxic
   (21 \% O-2) and hypoxic (5 \% O2) conditions on the hWJ-MSC secretome.
   Subsequently, we address the impact of the distinct secretome in the
   neuronal cell survival and differentiation of human neural progenitor
   cells.
   Results: The present data indicate that the hWJ-MSC secretome collected
   from normoxic and hypoxic conditions displayed similar effects in
   supporting neuronal differentiation of human neural progenitor cells in
   vitro. However, proteomic analysis revealed that the use of hypoxic
   preconditioning led to the upregulation of several proteins within the
   hWJ-MSC secretome.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that the optimization of parameters
   such as hypoxia may lead to the development of strategies that enhance
   the therapeutic effects of the secretome for future regenerative
   medicine studies and applications.}},

Abstract = {{Functionalized carbon nanotubes (f-CNTs), particularly CNTs decorated
   with nanoparticles (NPs), are of great interest because of their
   synergic effects, such as surface-enhanced Raman scattering, plasmonic
   resonance energy transfer, magnetoplasmonic, magnetoelectric, and
   magnetooptical effects. In general, research has focused on a single
   type of NP, such as a metal or metal oxide, that has been modified on a
   CNT surface. In this study, however, a new strategy is introduced for
   the decoration of two different NP types on CNTs. In order to improve
   the functionality of modified CNTs, we successfully prepared binary
   NP-decorated CNTs, namely, iron oxide/gold (Au) NP-decorated CNTs
   (IA-CNTs), which were created through two simple reactions in deionized
   water, without high temperature, high pressure, or harsh reducing
   agents. The physicochemical properties of IA-CNTs were characterized by
   ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy, a superconducting quantum interference device, scanning
   electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. In this
   study, IA-CNTs were utilized to detect humidity. Magnetic IA-CNTs were
   aligned on interdigitated platinum electrodes under external magnetic
   fields to create a humidity-sensing channel, and its electrical
   conductivity was monitored. As the humidity increased, the electrical
   resistance of the sensor also increased. In comparison with various
   gases, for example, H-2, O-2, CO, CO2, SO2, and dry air, the
   IA-CNT-based humidity sensor exhibited high-selectivity performances.
   IA-CNTs also responded to heavy water (D2O), and it was established that
   the humidity detection mechanism had D2O-sensing capabilities. Further,
   the humidity from human out-breathing was also successfully detected by
   this system. In conclusion, these unique IA-CNTs exhibited potential
   application as gas detection materials.}},

Abstract = {{An electronic nose (e-nose) for identification and quantification of
   volatile organic compounds (VOCs) vapor mixtures was developed using
   nanoporeenhanced opto-calorimetric spectroscopy. Opto-calorimetric
   spectroscopy based on specific molecular vibrational transitions in the
   mid infrared (IR) ``molecular fingerprint{''} regime allows highly
   selective detection of VOCs vapor mixtures. Nanoporous anodic aluminum
   oxide (AAO) microcantilevers, fabricated using a two-step anodization
   and simple photolithography process, were utilized as highly sensitive
   thermomechanical sensors for opto-calorimetric signal transduction. The
   AAO microcantilevers were optimized by fine-tuning AAO nanopore diameter
   in order to enhance their thermomechanical sensitivity as well as their
   surface area. The thermomechanical sensitivity of a bilayer AAO
   microcantilever with a 60 nm pore diameter was approximately 1 mu m/K,
   which is far superior to that of a bilayer plain silicon (Si)
   microcantilever. The adsorbed molecules of VOCs mixtures on the AA
   microcantilever were fully recognized and quantified by variations of
   peak positions and amplitudes in the opto-calorimetric IR spectra as
   well as by shifts in the resonance frequency of the AAO microcantilever
   with the adsorbed molecules. Furthermore, identification of complex
   organic compounds with a real industrial sample was demonstrated by this
   e-nose system.}},

Abstract = {{Enormous global reserves of unconventional, heavy oil make it a
   significant resource for economic growth and energy security; however,
   its extraction faces many challenges especially on greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions, water consumption, and recently, social acceptability. Here,
   we question whether it makes sense to extract and use unconventional
   heavy oil in spite of these externalities. We place unconventional oils
   (oil sands and oil shale) alongside shale gas, coal, lignite, wood
   and,conventional oil and gas, and compare their energy intensities and
   life cycle GHG emissions. Our results reveal that oft shale is the most
   energy intensive fuel among upgraded primary fossil fuel options
   followed by in situ-produced bitumen from oil sande. Lignite is the most
   GHG intensive primary fuel followed by oil shale. Based On future world
   energy demand projections, we estimate that if growth of unconventional
   heavy oil production continues unabated, the incremental GHG omissions
   that results from replacing conventional oil with heavy oil would amount
   to 4-21,Gt-CO(2)eq GtCO(2)eq over four decades (2010 by 2050). However,
   prevailing socio-economic, regional and global energy politics,
   environmental and technological challenges may limit growth of heavy oil
   production and thus its GHG emissions contributions to global fossil
   fuel emissions may be smaller.}},

Abstract = {{Knee osteoarthritis (OA) causes structural and mechanical changes within
   tibiofemoral (TF) cartilage affecting tissue load deformation behavior.
   Quantifying in-vivo TF soft tissue deformations in healthy and early OA
   may provide a novel biomechanical marker, sensitive to alterations
   occurring prior to radiographic change. Dual Fluoroscopy (DF) allows
   accurate in-vivo TF soft tissue deformation assessment but requires
   validation. In-vivo healthy and early OA TF cartilage deforms 0.3-1.2 mm
   during static standing full body-weight loading. Our aim was to
   establish minimum detectable displacement (MDD) for femoral translation
   in a DF system using a marker-based and markerless approach with
   variable image intensifier magnifications. An instrumented frame allowed
   controlled femur specimen translations. Bone positions were
   reconstructed from DF data using centroids of affixed steel beads
   (marker-based) and 2D-3D bone feature registration (markerless).
   Statistical analyses included independent samples t-tests and
   reliability analysis. Markerless measurements by three trained operators
   had large variations making it prudent to have an appropriate error
   management strategy when performing 2D-3D registration. Marker-based MDD
   improved with image resolution and was 0.05 mm at 3.2 LP/mm (LP: line
   pairs). Markerless MDD at 3.2 LP/mm was 0.08 mm. Average femur and tibia
   2D-3D registrations yielded excellent reliability (84.4\%). Therefore,
   DF images acquired at resolution greater than 3.2 LP/mm would be capable
   for determining accurate and reliable in-vivo healthy and early OA TF
   soft tissue deformation. This study provides a registration error
   management strategy for in-vivo TF soft tissue deformation assessment
   that could be applied for future clinical applications to establish
   non-invasive biomechanical markers for early OA diagnosis. (C) 2015

Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Electricity load forecasting plays a key role in operation of power
   systems. Since the penetration of distributed and renewable generation
   is increasingly growing in many countries, Short-Term Load Forecast
   (STLF) of micro-grids is also becoming an important task. A precise STLF
   of the micro-grid can enhance the management of its renewable and
   conventional resources and improve the economics of energy trade with
   electricity markets. As a consequence of the highly non-smooth and
   volatile behavior of the load time series in a micro-grid, its STLF is
   even a more complex process than that of a power system. For this
   purpose, a new prediction method is proposed in this paper, in which a
   Self-Recurrent Wavelet Neural Network (SRWNN) is applied as the forecast
   engine. Moreover, the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) learning algorithm is
   implemented and adapted to train the SRWNN. In order to demonstrate the
   efficiency of the proposed method, it is examined on real-world hourly
   data of an educational building within a micro-grid. Comparisons with
   other load prediction methods are provided. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Recent developments in heavy oil recovery methods indicate that the
   co-injection of solvent and steam can result in higher oil production
   rates. To investigate the performance and gain a better understanding of
   this newly developed process, it is essential to study the phase
   behavior of solvent/heavy crude oil mixtures and measure the saturated
   phase properties. This study attempts to provide insight into the phase
   behavior of propane/bitumen mixtures over wide ranges of temperatures
   and pressures, where the conditions would be applicable for both Vapex
   and ES-SAGD processes. Thus, phase behavior experiments for
   propane/Athabasca bitumen mixtures were conducted over temperature range
   of 323-473 K and at pressures up to 10 MPa. The results indicate that
   the mixture of propane and bitumen forms vapor-liquid and liquid-liquid
   phase separations over the studied temperature and pressure ranges. The
   variation of solubility with equilibrium pressure was found to be more
   significant at low temperatures. There were crossovers for gas-saturated
   bitumen density and viscosity which highlights the effect of solubility
   at low temperatures that is more significant than the effect of
   temperature on the bitumen density and viscosity. Thus, lower saturated
   properties were obtained at low temperatures and high pressures. The
   solubility and saturated liquid density were well predicted by
   Peng-Robinson equation of state and the saturated bitumen viscosities
   were reasonably correlated with Pedersen's correlation. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{NiMo sulfide nanoparticles were prepared by precipitation using water in
   oil (w/o) microemulsions, and were characterized by X-ray diffraction
   (XRD), Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), X Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
   (XPS) and nitrogen adsorption (BET). They were also tested in the HDS of
   vacuum gas oil (VGO). Nanoparticles of 3-5 nm which produced 50\% HDS
   conversion of a Vacuum Gas Oil (VGO), as well as an enhanced HDN
   activity (when compared to a NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst), were obtained. After
   sulfidation of the solids the Ni, at the surface, is mainly decorating
   the edges of the MoS2 slabs (90 at.\%), however, an important proportion
   of the Ni segregates out of this position during the reaction (39\%).

   ratio of the precursors (i.e., 6.3, 3.6, 2.0, 1.0 and 0.6) and the
   presence or not of H-2, it is possible to produce nanocrystalline
   molybdenum carbide materials with the cubic or hexagonal phases. The two
   prepared phases of molybdenum carbide showed activity for the
   hydrogenation of toluene at 423 K to selectively produce

Abstract = {{Organomodified clays are known to be effective in polymer blend
   compatibilization if located preferentially at the domain interfaces,
   but little is known regarding the origin of their localization. In this
   study, we investigate the effect of organomodifier, clay loading, and
   shear environment on the compatibilization extent in nonreactive
   polyethylene (LDPE)/poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and reactive maleic
   anhydride functional polyethylene (PE-g-MA)/PEO polymer blends. We pose
   important questions: If clay is to compatibilize blends by interfacial
   localization, how does organomodifier affect its localization? How does
   an increase in clay loading affect the shape and elasticity of the
   interface? What is the shear intensity needed to overcome the
   equilibrium distribution of clays and delaminate it from the interface?
   We utilize laser scanning confocal microscopy and 3D image analysis to
   calculate characteristic phase size and gain unique insights into the
   connection between the clay loading and the interfacial curvature. Our
   experiments demonstrate that 1 wt \% of interfacially localized clay is
   sufficient to suppress coarsening and greatly reduce phase domains.
   However, further increase of clay loading only saw a marginal reduction
   in phase size compared to 1 wt \% clay loading. The interfacial
   curvature calculations showed that with increase in clay loadings beyond
   1 wt \% the shape of the interface does not change significantly;
   however, slight broadening of curvature distribution and increasing
   asymmetry are observed from 3D images. This can be attributed to the
   multiple layers of clay jammed at the interface at higher clay loadings.
   When reactive PE-g-MA was substituted for LDPE, graft copolymers were
   generated via in situ coupling at the interface. These copolymers
   combined with clay resulted in the smallest phase domains. In addition,
   we show that clay dispersion and localization were largely independent
   of shear intensity, which suggests that clay does not delaminate from
   the interface even in high shear environments.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in Web technologies have opened avenues to create
   socio-technical platforms that can empower citizens in urban planning
   processes. The rise of the GeoWeb and the popularity of Web 2.0
   collaborative tools can facilitate the development of a new generation
   of bottom-up Public Participatory GIS (PPGIS) platforms that can
   incorporate user-generated content into Spatial Data Infrastructures
   (SDIs). New service-based delivery mechanisms can provide architectural
   flexibility and adaptability, and enable the public to benefit from
   ubiquitous information access. From an e-participation perspective, Web
   2.0 social networking functions support interactive communication among
   various PPGIS stakeholders, e.g., citizens, planners, and decision
   makers. The main contribution of this article is to present a reference
   architecture for e-planning platforms that (1) facilitates effective
   e-participation by allowing multidirectional map-based communication
   among various land development stakeholders (e.g., planners, decision
   makers, citizens, etc.), and (2) enables incorporation of visualization,
   evaluation, and discussion capabilities to support community planning
   processes. To achieve this, we developed a service-oriented architecture
   (SOA) that exploits SDI principles and Web 2.0 technologies. The
   platform architecture allows heterogeneous data sources, analytical
   functionality and tools, and presentation frameworks to be plugged into
   a coherent system to provide a planning and decision support platform.
   We present two real-world implementations of the proposed architecture
   that have been developed to support community engagement in the City of
   Calgary, Canada.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a Lattice Boltzmann method is used to simulation
   steady-state, laminar, free convection in two-dimensional annuli between
   a heated triangular inner cylinder and elliptical outer cylinder. The
   gap is filled with air as the working fluid. A constant temperature
   boundary condition is imposed on both the inner and outer surfaces. The
   study is performed for different inclination angles of inner triangular
   and outer elliptical cylinders at Ra=10(4). The inclination angle is
   varied from 0 degrees to 120 degrees for the triangular cylinder and
   from 0 degrees to 90 degrees for the elliptical cylinder. Furthermore,
   the vertical and horizontal eccentricity of the inner cylinder is
   investigated. The results for the inner and outer cylinders are
   presented in the form of isotherms, streamlines, and local and average
   Nusselt numbers. The results indicated that overall average Nusselt
   number has a type of nonlinear polynomial function with the triangular
   inclination angles and an approximately linear relation with the
   elliptical inclination angles. Also, the overall average Nusselt number
   decreases with the inclination of the outer elliptical cylinder. In
   addition, the results show that maximum heat transfer rate is reached

Abstract = {{Beam-enhanced digital aperture arrays employ 2-D
   infinite-impulse-response (IIR) filters as a preprocessing stage for
   phased/timed-array beamformers to obtain lower side-lobe levels without
   compromising the array size or the main-lobe selectivity. A digital
   very-large-scale integration architecture is proposed for beam-enhanced
   linear aperture arrays. The proposed architecture consists of four
   subsystems: 2-D IIR prefiltering, beam steering via fast computation of
   filter coefficients, compensation for nonlinear phase, and
   phased/timed-array beamforming. Systolic-array architectures are used
   for first-and second-order 2-D IIR prefiltering subsystems, including
   fast computation of filter coefficients. The trade-off due to the
   nonlinear phase response of the 2-D IIR prefilter is partially
   compensated via fast Fourier transform-based complex phase rotations.
   Designs are implemented on a Xilinx Virtex-6 XC6VLX240T
   field-programmable gate-array device and verified using on-chip hardware
   cosimulation. Field-programmable gate-array designs for both 2-D IIR
   prefiltering and filter coefficient computation are mapped to
   standard-cell application-specific integrated circuits in 45 nm
   complementary metal-oxide semiconductor technology up to the synthesis
   level with supply V-DC = 1.1 V. For a simulation having 64 antennas with
   binary phase-shift keying modulation, the beam-enhanced aperture array
   provides better than 10 dB improvement in bit error rate versus
   signal-to-interference ratio performance compared to phased/timed-array
   beamforming.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method that trains the WiFi fingerprint database
   using sensor-based navigation solutions. Since micro-electromechanical
   systems (MEMS) sensors provide only a short-term accuracy but suffer
   from the accuracy degradation with time, we restrict the time length of
   available indoor navigation trajectories, and conduct post-processing to
   improve the sensor-based navigation solution. Different middle-term
   navigation trajectories that move in and out of an indoor area are
   combined to make up the database. Furthermore, we evaluate the effect of
   WiFi database shifts on WiFi fingerprinting using the database generated
   by the proposed method. Results show that the fingerprinting errors will
   not increase linearly according to database (DB) errors in
   smartphone-based WiFi fingerprinting applications.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed the slant stacking approach in the generalized
   S-transform (GST) domain of seismic data for the estimation of the group
   velocity of the multimodal surface wave. We used two versions of the
   GST. The constant-scale GST uses a constant scaling factor in the
   Gaussian window to control the spectral time-frequency localization. We
   found that a smaller scaling factor should be chosen for the
   low-frequency surface wave, whereas for higher frequencies, a larger
   scaling factor should be chosen. Therefore, the transform exhibits a
   trade-off in the group velocity resolution of low frequencies with small
   values of the scaling factor and the group velocity resolution of high
   frequencies with large values of the scaling factor. The modified
   S-transform (MST), another version of the GST used in this study,
   enhanced the time-frequency resolution by projecting the frequency into
   a linear frequency function in the Gaussian window. This property
   allowed us to estimate the group velocity for a broad range of
   frequencies. We demonstrated the robustness of the MST for the
   estimation of the group velocity by synthetic and real data examples.}},

Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{233-244}},

Abstract = {{One of the issues for the pipeline transportation of diluted bitumen
   (dilbit) is the fate and behaviour of the dilbit if it is spilled in
   freshwater systems; in particular, the evaporation rate and the change
   in physical properties of the film after evaporation and exposure to
   water (weathering). In this study, the evaporative weathering of dilbit
   Cold Lake Winter Blend (CLWB) and light crude oil Alberta Sweet Blend
   (ASB) films were compared. Evaporation rates were measured for films on
   glass over time (up to 30 days) at different air-flow rates and at
   temperatures of 5, 15, and 25 degrees C. The solvent content, density,
   and viscosity of the films were measured after different weathering
   times. A second set of tests at 15 degrees C was performed on both
   dilbit and light-crudeoil films on water.
   As expected, the mass-transfer rate increased with increasing
   temperature and decreasing film thickness in all cases. The evaporation
   of the dilbit was found to be limited by the diffusion rate of the
   lighter components through the film while that of the light crude oil
   was limited by convective mass transfer to the air above. The density
   and viscosity of both the CLWB and ASB films correlated to the amount of
   evaporated material at all conditions examined, including different film
   thicknesses, temperatures, and air-flow rates. It appears that the
   volatile components evaporate in the same order at any conditions;
   therefore, film composition, density, and viscosity are only functions
   of the amount evaporated. The evaporation rates, density, and viscosity
   of CLWB and ASB films weathered over water were identical to those
   corresponding films weathered on glass, within the error of the
   measurements; that is, contact with still water had no effect on
   weathering.}},

Abstract = {{Asphaltenes may generate production loss in oil reservoirs, because of
   several factors related to the interaction between the asphaltene
   molecules, aggregates, and the reservoir rock. Consequently, this could
   alter the wettability of the rock surface, increase the viscosity of the
   crude oil, and reduce the permeability of the porous media. In a
   previous study, we have developed the solid-liquid equilibrium (SLE)
   model based on Chemical Theory to describe the adsorption behavior of
   asphaltenes onto porous and nonporous solid surfaces. However, the SLE
   model neglects the effect of pressure on the interactions of
   asphaltene-asphaltene and asphaltene-aggregate-solid surfaces of the
   reservoir rock primarily under reservoir conditions (RC). Thus, in this
   study, to account for the effect of pressure, a modification to the
   previously developed SLE equation is presented. In this study, a novel
   and original model-called the SLE-RC model of adsorption-has been
   proposed to describe the adsorption mechanism mainly under reservoir
   conditions, for which the pressure and temperature effect has been
   evaluated. This model describes the temperature-pressure-dependent
   adsorption isotherms with five parameters: the maximum amount adsorbed,
   the constant of the i-mer reactions, Henry's law constant, the molar
   volume, and the solubility parameter of the asphaltenes. The proposed
   model has been validated with adsorption tests on porous media under
   flow conditions at different pressures and temperatures. The dynamic
   adsorption experiments were performed at different asphaltene
   concentrations (100-2000 mg/L), pressures (6.89-17.24 MPa), and
   temperatures (313-353 K). The SLE-RC model was successful validated
   using more than five experimental data describing the adsorption
   isotherms of the asphaltene onto a packed bed of silica sand at high
   pressure and temperature and following a Type III behavior with
   root-mean-square errors (RMSE\%) below 2\%. In addition, the packed
   sands used in the adsorption tests were analyzed based on surface and
   color changes using scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
   energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis, and polarized light
   microscopy (PLM); the results were in agreement with the SLE-RC model
   parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Cartilage injuries are a major concern in the field of orthopedics. They
   occur following trauma, as well as from a variety of pathological
   conditions including Osteoarthritis (OA). Although cartilage does not
   exhibit robust endogenous repair, it has been demonstrated that
   modulating the activity of p21 can increase the regenerative abilities
   of cartilage in vitro and in vivo.
   Since the synovial membrane is abundant with mesenchymal progenitor
   cells (MPCs) capable of differentiating into cartilage both in vitro and
   in vivo, we examined if p21 expression levels varied between MPCs
   derived from normal vs. OA knee joints.
   Analysis of p21 at the mRNA and protein levels within normal and OA MPCs
   demonstrated differential levels of expression between these two groups,
   with OA MPCs having higher p21 expression levels. The higher levels of
   p21 in OA MPCs are also correlated with a decreased chondrogenic
   differentiation capacity and synovial inflammation, however, there was
   no evidence of senescence in the OA cells.
   The results of this study suggest that cell cycle regulation in MPCs may
   be altered in OA and that modulation of this pathway may have
   therapeutic potential once the mechanism by which this regulates
   stem/progenitor cells is better understood. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland

Abstract = {{Aims Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) due to spontaneous calcium
   (Ca) release (SCR) events at the cell level can precipitate ventricular
   arrhythmias. However, the mechanistic link between SCRs and PVC
   formation remains incompletely understood. The aim of this study was to
   investigate the conditions under which delayed afterdepolarizations
   resulting from stochastic subcellular SCR events can overcome
   electrotonic source-sink mismatch, leading to PVC initiation.
   Methods and results A stochastic subcellular-scale mathematical model of
   SCR was incorporated in a realistic model of the rabbit ventricles and
   Purkinje system (PS). Elevated levels of diastolic sarcoplasmic
   reticulum Ca2+ (Ca-SR) were imposed until triggered activity was
   observed, allowing us to compile statistics on probability, timing, and
   location of PVCs. At Ca-SR >= 1500 mu mol/L PVCs originated in the PS.
   When SCR was incapacitated in the PS, PVCs also emerged in the
   ventricles, but at a higher Ca-SR (>= 1550 mu mol/L) and with longer
   waiting times. For each model configuration tested, the probability of
   PVC occurrence increased from 0 to 100\% within a well-defined critical
   Ca-SR range; this transition was much more abrupt in organ-scale models
   (similar to 50 mu mol/L Ca-SR range) than in the tissue strand (similar
   to 100 mu mol/L) or single-cell (similar to 450 mu mol/L) models. Among
   PVCs originating in the PS, similar to 68\% were located near
   Purkinje-ventricular junctions (<1 mm).
   Conclusion SCR events overcome source-sink mismatch to trigger PVCs at a
   critical Ca-SR threshold. Above this threshold, PVCs emerge due to
   increased probability and reduced variability in timing of SCR events,
   leading to significant diastolic depolarization. Sites of lower
   electronic load, such as the PS, are preferential locations for
   triggering.}},

Abstract = {{With a universally accepted abuse of terminology, materials having much
   larger stiffness for volumetric than for shear deformations are called
   incompressible. This work proposes two approaches for the evaluation of
   the correct form of the linear elasticity tensor of so-called
   incompressible materials, both stemming from non-linear theory. In the
   approach of strict incompressibility, one imposes the kinematical
   constraint of isochoric deformation. In the approach of
   quasi-incompressibility, which is often employed to enforce
   incompressibility in numerical applications such as the Finite Element
   Method, one instead assumes a decoupled form of the elastic potential
   (or strain energy), which is written as the sum of a function of the
   volumetric deformation only and a function of the distortional
   deformation only, and then imposes that the bulk modulus be much larger
   than all other moduli. The conditions which the elasticity tensor has to
   obey for both strict incompressibility and quasi-incompressibility have
   been derived, regardless of the material symmetry. The representation of
   the linear elasticity tensor for the quasi-incompressible case differs
   from that of the strictly incompressible case by one parameter, which
   can be conveniently chosen to be the bulk modulus. Some important
   symmetries have been studied in detail, showing that the linear
   elasticity tensors for the cases of isotropy, transverse isotropy and
   orthotropy are characterised by one, three and six independent
   parameters, respectively, for the case of strict incompressibility, and
   two, four and seven independent parameters, respectively, for the case
   of quasi-incompressibility, as opposed to the two, five and nine
   parameters, respectively, of the general compressible case.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction
   technique using a polynomial soft clipping function identified through a
   nonlinear constrained optimization. The power efficiency optimization
   problem of a linearized power amplifier can be considered as the
   minimization of the PAPR constrained by meeting the spectral mask
   requirements of the signal standard. It is demonstrated that the
   proposed approach can reduce the PAPR from 9.9 to 5.5 dB while meeting
   the spectral mask of the wideband code-division multiple-access
   standard. To compare the results with the traditional clipping and
   filtering method, the 5.5-dB PAPR clipped signal using the clipping and
   filtering technique was compared with the soft clipped signal. With the
   same efficiency, the error vector magnitude (EVM) for the soft clipped
   signal improved from 4.5\% to 1.3\% using post-compensation. Later,
   clipping and filtering are combined with the soft clipping technique. It
   is shown that the combined structure can reduce the PAPR to 3.4 dB while
   passing the adjacent channel power ratio and EVM requirements. The
   performance of the proposed method in the presence of additive white
   Gaussian noise and fading channels has been evaluated for 64QAM
   modulations using orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing modulated

Abstract = {{Offloading the users from capacity-strained macro-cells in a cellular
   network to small cells is an effective strategy to support the
   increasing mobile data traffic, but a key challenge is how to
   simultaneously achieve high spectrum efficiency (SE) and energy
   efficiency (EE) in the heterogeneous radio access technology (RAT)
   environment. This paper develops an analytical framework for studying
   the performance of a two-RAT heterogeneous network (HetNet) comprising
   cellular and wireless local area network (WLAN) RATs. Using the
   developed framework, the feasibility of enhancing the SE and EE via the
   implementation of biased intra-and inter-RAT offloading techniques is
   investigated. Findings from the analysis reveal that the performance
   gain for SE and EE is strongly dependent on the load level and the base
   station (BS) power consumption attributes. A multiobjective optimization
   problem that maximizes the SE and EE subject to quality-of-service (QoS)
   constraints is formulated and solved to give the Pareto-optimal
   operational regime specified in terms of the small-cell BS densities and
   biasing factors. The novelty of this paper is the quantification of the
   SE-EE tradeoff as an opportunity cost measure, which is defined by the
   constrained Pareto-optimal regime. The insight gained from analyzing the
   opportunity cost is used to formulate a strategy that exploits the
   varying load conditions to achieve a good balance in the SE-EE tradeoff.
   Numerical results show that, although the potential to reduce the
   performance gap between SE and EE is marginal under low and high load
   conditions, it is feasible to significantly improve the network
   performance by balancing the SE-EE tradeoff during the medium load
   condition, as well as satisfy the users' QoS requirements by optimally
   adapting the small-cell BS density and offloading biasing factors.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous solutions/methods to solve the existing problems of pedestrian
   navigation/localization have been proposed in the last decade by both
   industrial and academic researchers. However, to date there are still
   major challenges for a single pedestrian navigation system (PNS) to
   operate continuously, robustly, and seamlessly in all indoor and outdoor
   environments. In this paper, a novel method for pedestrian navigation
   approach to fuse the information from two separate PNSs is proposed.
   When both systems are used at the same time by a specific user, a
   nonlinear inequality constraint between the two systems' navigation
   estimates always exists. Through exploring this constraint information,
   a novel filtering technique named Kalman filter with state constraint is
   used to diminish the positioning errors of both systems. The proposed
   method was tested by fusing the navigation information from two
   different PNSs, one is the foot-mounted inertial navigation system (INS)
   mechanization-based system, the other PNS is a navigation device that is
   mounted on the user's upper body, and adopting the pedestrian dead
   reckoning (PDR) mechanization for navigation update. Monte Carlo
   simulations and real field experiments show that the proposed method for
   the integration of multiple PNSs could improve each PNS' navigation
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Degradable fiber can temporarily plug a natural fracture or artificial
   fracture. It has been successfully applied in the stimulated reservoir
   volume (SRV) fracturing or re-fracturing of unconventional reservoirs.
   Based on the classical analytical stress field equation, a new

   reorientation path after injecting fiber diversion fluid according to
   the tensile failure criterion. Factors influencing the diverting radius
   are intensively analyzed through numerical simulation. The results
   indicate that the horizontal stress difference, fracturing fluid
   viscosity, and injection time (fracturing fluid volume) have larger
   effects on the diverting radius than do the formation permeability (1-50
   mD) and bottomhole pressure (90-160 MPa). The simulation results are
   successfully verified, matching well with the experimental data from the
   true tri-axial fracture reorientation tests in the laboratory. The model
   is successfully applied to the heterogeneous carbonate reservoirs in

Abstract = {{Cerebrovascular imaging is of great interest in the understanding of
   neurological disease. MRI is a non-invasive technology that can
   visualize and provide information on: (i) the structure of major blood
   vessels; (ii) the blood flow velocity in these vessels; and (iii) the
   microcirculation, including the assessment of brain perfusion. Although
   other medical imaging modalities can also interrogate the
   cerebrovascular system, MR provides a comprehensive assessment, as it
   can acquire many different structural and functional image contrasts
   whilst maintaining a high level of patient comfort and acceptance. The
   extent of examination is limited only by the practicalities of patient
   tolerance or clinical scheduling limitations. Currently, MRI methods can
   provide a range of metrics related to the cerebral vasculature,
   including: (i) major vessel anatomy via time-of-flight and
   contrast-enhanced imaging; (ii) blood flow velocity via phase contrast
   imaging; (iii) major vessel anatomy and tissue perfusion via arterial
   spin labeling and dynamic bolus passage approaches; and (iv) venography
   via susceptibility-based imaging. When designing an MRI protocol for
   patients with suspected cerebral vascular abnormalities, it is
   appropriate to have a complete understanding of when to use each of the
   available techniques in the MR angiography toolkit'. In this review
   article, we: (i) overview the relevant anatomy, common pathologies and
   alternative imaging modalities; (ii) describe the physical principles
   and implementations of the above listed methods; (iii) provide guidance
   on the selection of acquisition parameters; and (iv) describe the
   existing and potential applications of MRI to the cerebral vasculature
   and diseases. The focus of this review is on obtaining an understanding
   through the application of advanced MRI methodology of both normal and
   abnormal blood flow in the cerebrovascular arteries, capillaries and
   veins. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{Phase contrast (PC) magnetic resonance imaging was used to obtain
   velocity measurements in 30 healthy subjects to provide an assessment of
   hemodynamic parameters in cerebral vessels. We expect a lower
   coefficient-of-variation (COV) of the volume flow rate (VFR) compared to
   peak velocity (v(peak)) measurements and the COV to increase in smaller
   caliber arteries compared to large arteries.
   PC velocity maps were processed to calculate v(peak) and VFR in 26
   vessel segments. The mean, standard deviation and COV, of v(peak) and
   VFR in each segment were calculated. A bootstrap-style analysis was used
   to determine the minimum number of subjects required to accurately
   represent the population. Significance of v(peak) and VFR asymmetry was
   assessed in 10 vessel pairs.
   The bootstrap analysis suggested that averaging more than 20 subjects
   would give consistent results. When averaged over the subjects, v(peak)
   and VFR ranged from 5.2 +/- 7.1 cm s(-1), 0.41 +/- 0.58 ml s(-1) (in the
   anterior communicating artery; mean +/- standard deviation) to 73 +/- 23
   cm s(-1), 7.6 +/- 1.7 ml s(-1) (in the left internal carotid artery),
   respectively. A tendency for VFR to be higher in the left hemisphere was
   observed in 88.8\% of artery pairs, while the VFR in the right
   transverse sinus was larger. The VFR COV was larger than v(peak) COV in
   57.7\% of segments, while smaller vessels had higher COV.
   Significance and potential impact: VFR COV was not generally higher than
   v(peak) COV. COV was higher in smaller vessels as expected. These
   summarized values provide a base against which v(peak) and VFR in
   various disease states can be compared.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-constellation GNSS precise point positioning (PPP) first became
   feasible back to 2007 but with only two constellations, namely GPS and
   GLONASS. With the availability of more satellites and precise orbit and
   clock products from BeiDou and Galileo, it is possible now to
   investigate PPP with four constellations, namely GPS, BeiDou, GLONASS
   and Galileo. This research aims at investigating the quad-constellation
   PPP for position determination and analyzing its positioning
   performance. A quad-constellation PPP model is developed to
   simultaneously process the observations from all the four GNSS systems.
   The developed model is also applicable to the PPP processing with
   observations from single, dual or triple constellations. The analysis on
   PPP accuracy and convergence time is conducted based on data processing
   results from both static and kinematic tests of single-constellation and
   multi-constellations. The three-hour static positioning results indicate
   that the BeiDou-only PPP accuracy is worse than the GPS-only PPP. The
   RMSs of position errors for BeiDou-only PPP are 5.2 cm, 2.7 cm and 8.3
   cm in east, north and up directions while the ones for GPS-only PPP are
   3.9 cm, 1.6 cm and 5.7 cm. The GPS/BeiDou PPP improves the positioning
   accuracy by 28\%, 6\% and 7\% and reduces the convergence time by 26\%,
   13\% and 14\% over the GPS-only PPP in three coordinate components,
   respectively. The GPS/GLONASS PPP achieves slightly better performance
   than the GPS/BeiDou PPP. The triple-constellation PPP further increases
   the positioning accuracy and decreases the convergence time over the
   dual-constellation PPP. The improvement of positioning performance is
   not significant after adding Galileo due to currently limited number of
   satellites. Similar to the static positioning, the quad-constellation
   kinematic PPP also significantly improves the positioning performance in
   contrast with single-constellation and dual-constellations. The time
   varying characteristics of the time differences between the four systems
   are also investigated. The results indicate that the system time
   differences of GPS with BeiDou, GLONASS and Galileo are very stable over
   time with STD values of better than 1.1 ns. (C) 2015 COSPAR. Published

Abstract = {{Underground coal gasification (UCG) has significant advantages and can
   be categorized as a clean coal technology for producing syngas in situ.
   However, a comprehensive understanding of the process is lacking,
   because it takes place deep underground and consists of multiple
   phenomena. Hence UCG modelling can be employed to investigate different
   aspects of this process. While small-scale processes can be
   mechanistically informative, large-scale processes may behave quite
   differently. In this work, detailed 3D simulation modelling of three
   widely-applied UCG technologies was conducted for the Ardley coal
   formation (Alberta, Canada) in order to compare the performance of
   different technologies at field scale. The results of these comparisons
   can be helpful for selecting the right technology for a desired UCG
   pilot test. The results show that in spite of a higher heating value of
   produced syngas from the P-CRIP (parallel controlled retracting
   injection point) method over the L-CRIP (linear controlled retracting
   injection point) method, the volumetric rate and sweep efficiency of
   these methods are comparable. Moreover, we conducted 2D cross-sectional
   modelling of the Thulin test as the earliest UCG process at great depth
   and in tight coal seams to address modelling issues. Several possible
   approaches, such as geomechanical modelling, are presented to resolve
   the issues of UCG modelling in tight coal seams. The modelling results
   are analyzed and compared with the field results. Comparisons show an
   engineering match for the composition of the produced syngas. Computer
   Modelling Group's STARS software was used in this study as the porous
   medium modelling approach.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Hydrated soft tissues, such as articular cartilage, are often modeled as
   biphasic systems with individually incompressible solid and fluid
   phases, and biphasic models are employed to fit experimental data in
   order to determine the mechanical and hydraulic properties of the
   tissues. Two of the most common experimental setups are confined and
   unconfined compression. Analytical solutions exist for the unconfined
   case with the linear, isotropic, homogeneous model of articular
   cartilage, and for the confined case with the non-linear, isotropic,
   homogeneous model. The aim of this contribution is to provide an easily
   implementable numerical tool to determine a solution to the governing
   differential equations of (homogeneous and isotropic) unconfined and
   (inhomogeneous and isotropic) confined compression under large
   deformations. The large-deformation governing equations are reduced to
   equivalent diffusive equations, which are then solved by means of finite
   difference (FD) methods. The solution strategy proposed here could be
   used to generate benchmark tests for validating complex user-defined
   material models within finite element (FE) implementations, and for
   determining the tissue's mechanical and hydraulic properties from
   experimental data.}},

Title = {{Synergistic Effects of Age on Patterns of White and Gray Matter Volume
   across Childhood and Adolescence}},
Journal = {{ENEURO}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{The human brain develops with a nonlinear contraction of gray matter
   across late childhood and adolescence with a concomitant increase in
   white matter volume. Across the adult population, properties of cortical
   gray matter covary within networks that may represent organizational
   units for development and degeneration. Although gray matter covariance
   may be strongest within structurally connected networks, the
   relationship to volume changes in white matter remains poorly
   characterized. In the present study we examined age-related trends in
   white and gray matter volume using T1-weighted MR images from 360 human
   participants from the NIH MRI study of Normal Brain Development. Images
   were processed through a voxel-based morphometry pipeline. Linear
   effects of age on white and gray matter volume were modeled within four
   age bins, spanning 4-18 years, each including 90 participants (45 male).
   White and gray matter age-slope maps were separately entered into
   k-means clustering to identify regions with similar age-related
   variability across the four age bins. Four white matter clusters were
   identified, each with a dominant direction of underlying fibers:
   anterior-posterior, left-right, and two clusters with superior-inferior
   directions. Corresponding, spatially proximal, gray matter clusters
   encompassed largely cerebellar, fronto-insular, posterior, and
   sensorimotor regions, respectively. Pairs of gray and white matter
   clusters followed parallel slope trajectories, with white matter changes
   generally positive from 8 years onward (indicating volume increases) and
   gray matter negative (decreases). As developmental disorders likely
   target networks rather than individual regions, characterizing typical
   coordination of white and gray matter development can provide a
   normative benchmark for understanding atypical development.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a real-time calibration method for gyro sensors in
   consumer portable devices. The calibration happens automatically without
   the need for external equipment or user intervention. Multilevel
   constraints, including the pseudoobservations, the accelerometer and
   magnetometer measurements, and the quasi-static attitude updates, are
   used to make the method reliable and accurate under natural user
   motions. Walking tests with the Samsung Galaxy S3 and S4 smartphones
   showed that the method provided promising calibration results even under
   challenging motion modes, such as dangling and pocket, and in
   challenging indoor environments with frequent magnetic interferences.}},

Abstract = {{Convective mixing at the edge of the steam chamber enhances heat and
   mass transfer rates, which increases oil mobility and production rate. A
   linear stability analysis is performed under transient concentration and
   steady-state temperature boundary layers with temperature and
   concentration dependent fluid density and viscosity. It is found that
   the critical Rayleigh number depends on coefficients of the mixture
   viscosity and density function. Results show that the onset of
   instability is delayed as the concentration and temperature dependency
   of the solvent-oil mixture viscosity increases. Different potential
   solvents for heavy oil recovery are compared based on the critical time
   of instability. It is shown that intermediate molecular weight solvents
   lead to stronger convection, which is in agreement with experimental
   observations reported in the literature. These results are applicable
   for optimum design of laboratory experiments and selection of
   appropriate additives to steam for design of field- scale heavy oil
   recovery process.}},

Journal = {{GPS SOLUTIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{475-487}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Spoofing in the form of transmitting fake GNSS signals is a deliberate
   attack that aims to mislead GNSS receivers into generating false
   position/time solutions. Current work on GNSS spoofing has mainly
   focused on spoofing detection where the proposed algorithms only
   indicate the presence of spoofing attacks. A new architecture consisting
   of spoofing detection, authentic/spoofing signal classification and
   spoofing cancelation known as spoofing detection, classification and
   cancelation for moving GNSS receivers is proposed. Predespreading and
   acquisition level analysis are performed to detect the presence of
   spoofing interference. The receiver motion is then used to classify the
   signals tracked into two groups, namely spoofing and authentic signal
   sets. A successive spoofing cancelation method is then developed to
   remove the spoofing signals from the raw digitized samples. It is shown
   that canceling out the spoofing signals removes multiple access
   interference and significantly improves the authentic signals'
   detectability and tracking performance. Finally, after spoofing
   cancelation, authentic signals are acquired and tracked and their
   corresponding measurements are passed to a PVT engine for a reliable
   position solution. The proposed receiver architecture is analyzed in the
   acquisition, tracking and positioning layers.}},

Title = {{Myth about nano-fluid heat transfer enhancement}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{397-403}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The paper examines a few claims about the merit of using nano-particles
   to enhance the rate of heat transfer. In the literature, a few
   mechanisms were put forward to explain the magic of enhancing the rate
   of heat transfer by many folds compared with a clear fluid by adding a
   few percentages of nano-particles to the working fluid. In this work, a
   few introduced mechanisms is examined in the light of classical physics
   of the thermal diffusion and the fluid mechanics. Yet, no one able to
   break those simple physics; therefore, they should be valid for
   particles floating in a fluid. The paper for the first time reports the
   effect of particle alignment with the direction of heat flow
   (temperature gradient) effects on the effective thermal conductivity,
   which is significant. Furthermore, forced and natural convections are
   examined based on the classical theory of heat transport. We
   demonstrated the reason of why the rate of heat transfer decreases by
   adding nano-particles for a fluid experiencing natural convection. (C)

Abstract = {{Emissions standards are increasingly stringent due mainly to its impact
   on the environment. Although the diesel engine is an attractive solution
   for carbon dioxide reduction, a challenge remains to simultaneously
   control nitrogen oxides and matter particulate emissions to accepted
   levels. On engine tests, it has been observed that Fischer-Tropsch
   diesel significantly reduces CO, HC, PAHs and particulate emissions
   compared to oil derived diesel. However, selectivity control in Fischer
   Tropsch Synthesis is still a key challenge due the
   Anderson-Schultz-Flory polymerization mechanism followed by hydrocarbon
   distribution. In this work we are presenting the first steps towards a
   new strategy that can tune, in one step, the selectivity to desired
   products by taking advantage of the shape selectivity properties of
   SBA-15 mesoporous silica used as support.
   Co-SBA-15 (30\%wt) catalysts with different pore size were prepared by
   excess solution impregnation. Our results show that pore diameter not
   only affects the size and reducibility of Co particles but it also
   significantly influence the liquid products distribution, with the high
   molecular weight hydrocarbon fraction increasing on large pores,
   attributed to the existence of a shape selectivity effect induced by the
   textural properties of the catalyst namely its pore size and pore
   volume. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The present study mainly focuses on the phase behavior modeling of
   asymmetric binary mixtures. Capability of different mixing rules and
   volume shift in the prediction of solubility and saturated liquid
   density has been investigated. Different binary systems of (alkane +
   alkanol), (alkane + alkane), (carbon dioxide + alkanol), and (carbon
   dioxide + alkane) are considered. The composition and the density of
   saturated liquid phase at equilibrium condition are the properties of
   interest. Considering composition and saturated liquid density of
   different binary systems, three main objectives are investigated. First,
   three different mixing rules (one-parameter, two parameters and
   Wong-Sandler) coupled with Peng-Robinson equation of state were used to
   predict the equilibrium properties. The Wong-Sandler mixing rule was
   utilized with the non-random two-liquid (NRTL) model. Binary interaction
   coefficients and NRTL model parameters were optimized using the
   Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Second, to improve the density
   prediction, the volume translation technique was applied. Finally, Two
   different approaches were considered to tune the equation of state;
   regression of experimental equilibrium compositions and densities
   separately and spontaneously. The modeling results show that there is no
   superior mixing rule which can predict the equilibrium properties for
   different systems. Two-parameter and Wong-Sandler mixing rule show
   promoting results compared to one-parameter mixing rule. Wong-Sandler
   mixing rule in spite of its improvement in the prediction of saturated
   liquid compositions is unable to predict the liquid densities with
   sufficient accuracy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Upsampling method for sparse light detection and ranging using
   coregistered panoramic images}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JUN 24}},
Abstract = {{We present a method to upsample low-resolution light detection and
   ranging (LiDAR) data using coregistered panoramic images collected in
   urban environments. The context is a mobile mapping vehicle equipped
   with a LiDAR scanner and spherical camera system, where the goal is to
   recover a three-dimensional model of the built environment. What makes
   this problem challenging is that as LiDAR samples become sparse,
   interpolation becomes difficult as connectivity between points can
   become ambiguous. The idea behind this paper is to use structural
   context and information in the associated panoramic images to determine
   the location of surfaces in the scene, and by inference, the surface
   membership of the LiDAR samples. With the latter determined, surfaces
   can then be reconstructed via interpolation using a function appropriate
   to the task at hand. We show that this method is effective in recovering
   details that are not apparent in the initial dataset. In the event that
   images are either uninformative or not available, we introduce a
   fallback method for surface segmentation that infers depth
   discontinuities from the properties of the surface triangulation.
   Experimental results are presented showing the performance of both
   methods on data acquired from an urban setting. (C) 2015 Society of

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the problem of distributed parameter
   estimation in imperfect environments for wireless sensor networks
   (WSNs). By imperfect environments, we refer to distortions that can be
   caused by sensor noise, quantization noise and channel effect. A novel
   statistical model is proposed to quantify these errors in WSNs. The
   first and second order statistics are derived analytically. The
   estimator is then probability density function unaware. An analytical
   bound of the mean square error (MSE) performance at the fusion center is
   also derived. We further apply the proposed method to the power
   scheduling problem of WSNs. By formulating it as a convex optimization
   problem, an analytical solution is obtained. Simulation results show
   that the proposed approach outperforms the conventional distributed
   estimation methods. For the power scheduling application, the proposed
   method is shown to have an improved power saving compared to a classic
   method in the literature.}},

   shape}},

Abstract = {{Background: Microelectrode arrays have been used successfully for
   neuronal stimulation both in vivo and in vitro. However, in most
   instances currents required to activate the neurons have been in
   unphysiological ranges resulting in neuronal damage and cell death.
   There is a need to develop electrodes which require less stimulation
   current for neuronal activation with physiologically relevant efficacy
   and frequencies.
   New method: The objective of the present study was to examine and
   compare the stimulation efficiency of different electrode geometries at
   the resolution of a single neuron. We hypothesized that increasing the
   electrode perimeter will increase the maximum current density at the
   edges and enhance stimulation efficiency. To test this postulate, the
   neuronal stimulation efficacy of common circular electrodes (smallest
   perimeter) was compared with star (medium perimeter), and spiral
   (largest perimeter with internal boundaries) electrodes. We explored and
   compared using both a finite element model and in vitro stimulation of
   neurons isolated from Lymnaea central ganglia.
   Results: Interestingly, both the computational model and the live
   neuronal stimulation experiments demonstrated that the common circular
   microelectrode requires less stimulus to activate a cell compared to the
   other two electrode shapes with the same surface area. Our data further
   revealed that circular electrodes exhibit the largest sealing
   resistance, stimulus transfer, and average current density among the
   three types of electrodes tested.
   Comparison with existing methods: Average current density and not the
   maximum current density at the edges plays an important role in
   determining the electrode stimulation efficiency.
   Conclusion: Circular shaped electrodes are more efficient in inducing a
   change in neuronal membrane potential. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Study of heat transfer by thermal expansion of connate water ahead of a
   steam chamber edge in the steam-assisted-gravity-drainage process}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{150}},
Pages = {{592-601}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) has been the preferred thermal
   method for bitumen recovery from reservoirs in western Canada, such as
   Athabasca and Cold Lake. In SAGD, near the edge of a steam chamber, the
   viscosity of bitumen can be reduced by several orders of magnitude by
   the release of latent heat from injected steam. Consequently, the heated
   bitumen flows downwards to a horizontal production well, under the
   action of gravity. A critical control of oil production performance in
   SAGD is the heat transfer ahead of the steam chamber edge. It is
   commonly suggested that heat conduction is the only, or dominant,
   mechanism for heat to be transferred to the cold oil sands. Heat
   transfer through convection is neglected in classical models, such as in
   Butler's theory. Although a few mathematical studies have recently been
   performed to examine the role of convective heat transfer through
   condensate flow perpendicular or parallel to the steam chamber edge, the
   role of heat transfer by cold connate water thermal expansion in SAGD
   has been given little attention. In this study, an analytical model is
   derived for heat transfer induced by thermal expansion of the connate
   water, and the result is reasonably consistent with the numerical
   simulation results obtained by running CMG STARS. The relative roles of
   conduction and convection ahead of the steam chamber edge are
   re-examined. The results show that heat convection accounts for a much
   higher percentage of the total heat transfer than conduction. This study
   also suggests that parameters that have a close relationship with the
   thermal expansion of connate water, such as the steam injection
   temperature and connate water saturation, can affect the relative roles
   of conductive and convective heat transfer in SAGD. Based on this study,
   the heat transfer efficiency can be enhanced through improving
   convection induced by thermal expansion of connate water. (C) 2015

Month = {{JUN 12}},
Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to model amplitude
   modulation atomic force microscopy (AM-AFM). In this novel simulation,
   the model AFM tip responds to both tip-substrate interactions and to a
   sinusoidal excitation signal. The amplitude and phase shift of the tip
   oscillation observed in the simulation and their variation with
   tip-sample distance were found to be consistent with previously reported
   trends from experiments and theory. These simulation results were also
   fit to an expression enabling estimation of the energy dissipation,
   which was found to be smaller than that in a corresponding experiment.
   The difference was analyzed in terms of the effects of tip size and
   substrate thickness. Development of this model is the first step toward
   using MD to gain insight into the atomic-scale phenomena that occur
   during an AM-AFM measurement.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 10}},
Abstract = {{For the past 60 years, muscle contraction had been thought to be
   governed exclusively by the contractile filaments, actin, and myosin.
   This thinking explained most observations for concentric and isometric,
   but not for eccentric muscle contractions. Just over a decade ago, we
   discovered that eccentric contractions were associated with a force that
   could not be assigned to actin and myosin, but was at least in part
   associated with the filamentous protein titin. Titin was found to bind
   calcium upon activation, thereby increasing its structural stability,
   and thus its stiffness and force. Furthermore, there is increasing
   evidence that the proximal part of titin binds to actin in an
   activation- and force-dependent manner, thereby shortening its free
   length, thus increasing its stiffness and force. Therefore, we propose
   that muscle contraction involves three filaments, actin, myosin and
   titin, and that titin regulates force by binding calcium and by
   shortening its spring length by binding to actin.}},

Abstract = {{During the last two decades, a variety of models have been applied to
   understand and predict changes in land use. These models assign a
   single-attribute label to each spatial unit at any particular time of
   the simulation. This is not realistic because mixed use of land is quite
   common. A more detailed classification allowing the modelling of mixed
   land use would be desirable for better understanding and interpreting
   the evolution of the use of land. A possible solution is the multi-label
   (ML) concept where each spatial unit can belong to multiple classes
   simultaneously. For example, a cluster of summer houses at a lake in a
   forested area should be classified as water, forest and residential
   (built-up). The ML concept was introduced recently, and it belongs to
   the machine learning field. In this article, the ML concept is
   introduced and applied in land-use modelling. As a novelty, we present a
   land-use change model that allows ML class assignment using the k
   nearest neighbour (kNN) method that derives a functional relationship
   between land use and a set of explanatory variables. A case study with a
   rich data-set from Luxembourg using biophysical data from aerial
   photography is described. The model achieves promising results based on
   the well-known ML evaluation criteria. The application described in this
   article highlights the value of the multi-label k nearest neighbour
   method (MLkNN) for land-use modelling.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a versatile composite amplifier in which a current

   conventional OPA-CFA composite amplifier, an OPA drives a CFA resulting
   in a composite structure that combines the DC input stability of the OPA
   and the high speed capability of the CFA. The proposed composite
   configuration combines different features of the CFA and OPA,
   specifically the constant bandwidth property of the CFA and the high
   power and high current output capacity of the OPA. The new circuit is
   easily implemented in the standard inverting and non-inverting
   configurations using commercially available devices, and the accuracy
   and constant bandwidth features were experimentally verified. Local
   feedback around the associated CFA ensures that the proposed composite
   amplifier possesses a higher level of bandwidth constancy than a single

Abstract = {{A hydraulic teaching model of the human systemic circulation is
   proposed, based on the principles of the reservoir-wave approach.
   Reservoir characteristics are portrayed by the arterial tall-and-narrow
   and venous short-and-wide columns, the relative compliances of which are
   signified by their diameters. Wave characteristics are represented by
   proximal arterial and venous resistances; rapid left ventricular
   ejection and rapid right atrial filling cause flow-dependent pressure
   drops across the respective resistances. (The value of the proximal
   arterial resistance is numerically equal to the characteristic
   impedance.) The pressure drop across the proximal arterial resistance,
   excess pressure, is understood to be fundamentally wave-related and has
   been shown to be a measure of the efficiency of cardiac-vascular
   coupling. Excess pressure also predicts an incremental risk of
   cardiovascular morbidity and largely accounts for the hysteresis
   evidenced by an open aortic pressure-volume loop. (C) 2015 Association

Abstract = {{Probability is an extrapolative estimation and predication of uncertain
   outcomes of events based on certain norms in a predetermined probability
   space. The classic probability theory is cyclically defined among a set
   of highly coupled operations. A theory of fuzzy probability is
   introduced in order to extend the classic probability theory to deal
   with complex problems in the fuzzy probability space. The fuzzy
   probability theory is presented in a mathematical structure of fuzzy
   probability algebra (FPA). In FPA the mathematical model of fuzzy
   probability is created on the basis of fuzzy sets. Rigorous
   manipulations on fuzzy probabilities are formally described as a set of
   independent algebraic operators. Typical applications of FPA are
   illustrated for dealing with uncertain events and fuzzy causations in
   fuzzy inference, qualification, quantification, and semantic analysis.}},

Abstract = {{It is recognized that concepts are the most fundamental unit of human
   knowledge and semantic cognition, which carry stable semantics in
   expression, thinking, learning, reasoning, comprehension, and entity
   denotation. Although words in natural languages are often ambiguity and
   polymorphic, concepts elicited from them are not only unique in
   expressions but also neutral across different languages. Concept algebra
   is a denotational mathematics for rigorously manipulating formal
   concepts and their algebraic operations in knowledge representation and
   semantic analyses. In concept algebra, the formal concept is a general
   and dynamic mathematical structure that encapsulates the intension and
   extension of any language entity and its semantics. A set of algebraic
   operators of concept algebra is created for rigorous concept
   manipulations. Fundamental properties of formal concepts and concept
   algebra are revealed in the universe of discourse of general knowledge
   and semantics. A wide range of applications of concept algebra are
   identified in cognitive informatics, cognitive robotics, cognitive
   linguistics, cognitive computing, cognitive knowledge bases, formal
   semantic analyses, computational linguistics, natural language
   processing, cognitive search engines, cognitive translations, and

Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Enhancement of vehicular night vision thermal infrared images is an
   important problem in intelligent vehicles. We propose to create a
   colorful three-dimensional (3-D) display of infrared images for the
   vehicular night vision assistant driving system. We combine the plane
   parameter Markov random field (PP-MRF) model-based depth estimation with
   classification-based infrared image colorization to perform colored 3-D
   reconstruction of vehicular thermal infrared images. We first train the
   PP-MRF model to learn the relationship between superpixel features and
   plane parameters. The infrared images are then colorized and we perform
   superpixel segmentation and feature extraction on the colorized images.
   The PP-MRF model is used to estimate the superpixel plane parameter and
   to analyze the structure of the superpixels according to the
   characteristics of vehicular thermal infrared images. Finally, we
   estimate the depth of each pixel to perform 3-D reconstruction.
   Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can give a
   visually pleasing and daytime-like colorful 3-D display from a
   monochromatic vehicular thermal infrared image, which can help drivers
   to have a better understanding of the environment. (C) 2015 Society of

Journal = {{SENSORS}},

Abstract = {{The use of Space-Time Processing (STP) in Global Navigation Satellite
   System (GNSS) applications is gaining significant attention due to its
   effectiveness for both narrowband and wideband interference suppression.
   However, the resulting distortion and bias on the cross correlation
   functions due to space-time filtering is a major limitation of this
   technique. Employing the steering vector of the GNSS signals in the
   filter structure can significantly reduce the distortion on cross
   correlation functions and lead to more accurate pseudorange
   measurements. This paper proposes a two-stage interference mitigation
   approach in which the first stage estimates an interference-free
   subspace before the acquisition and tracking phases and projects all
   received signals into this subspace. The next stage estimates array
   attitude parameters based on detecting and employing GNSS signals that
   are less distorted due to the projection process. Attitude parameters
   enable the receiver to estimate the steering vector of each satellite
   signal and use it in the novel distortionless STP filter to
   significantly reduce distortion and maximize Signal-to-Noise Ratio
   (SNR). GPS signals were collected using a six-element antenna array
   under open sky conditions to first calibrate the antenna array.
   Simulated interfering signals were then added to the digitized samples
   in software to verify the applicability of the proposed receiver
   structure and assess its performance for several interference scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a WiFi-aided magnetic matching (MM) algorithm for
   indoor pedestrian navigation with consumer portable devices. This
   algorithm reduces both the mismatching rate (i.e., the rate of matching
   to an incorrect point that is more than 20 m away from the true value)
   and computational load of MM by using WiFi positioning solutions to
   limit the MM search space. Walking tests with Samsung Galaxy S3 and S4
   smartphones in two different indoor environments (i.e., Environment \#1
   with abundant WiFi APs and significant magnetic features, and
   Environment \#2 with less WiFi and magnetic information) were conducted
   to evaluate the proposed algorithm. It was found that WiFi
   fingerprinting accuracy is related to the signal distributions. MM
   provided results with small fluctuations but had a significant mismatch
   rate; when aided by WiFi, MM's robustness was significantly improved.
   The outcome of this research indicates that WiFi and MM have
   complementary characteristics as the former is a point-by-point matching
   approach and the latter is based on profile-matching. Furthermore,
   performance improvement through integrating WiFi and MM depends on the
   environment (e.g., the signal distributions of magnetic intensity and
   WiFi RSS): In Environment \#1 tests, WiFi-aided MM and WiFi provided
   similar results; in Environment \#2 tests, the former was approximately
   41.6\% better. Our results supported that the WiFi-aided MM algorithm
   provided more reliable solutions than both WiFi and MM in the areas that
   have poor WiFi signal distribution or indistinctive magnetic-gradient
   features.}},

Abstract = {{Providing an accurate and practical navigation solution anywhere with
   portable devices, such as smartphones, is still a challenge, especially
   in environments where global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) signals
   are not available or are degraded. This paper proposes a new algorithm
   that integrates inertial navigation system (INS) and pedestrian dead
   reckoning (PDR) to combine the advantages of both mechanizations for
   micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) sensors in pedestrian navigation
   applications. In this PDR/INS integration algorithm, a
   pseudo-velocity-vector, which is composed of the PDR-derived forward
   speed and zero lateral and vertical speeds from non-holonomic
   constraints (NHC), works as an update for the INS to limit the velocity
   errors. To further limit the drift of MEMS inertial sensors,
   trilateration-based WiFi positions with small variances are also
   selected as updates for the PDR/INS integrated system. The experiments
   illustrate that positioning error is decreased by 60\%-75\% by using the
   proposed PDR/INS integrated MEMS solution when compared with PDR. The
   positioning error is further decreased by 15\%-55\% if the proposed
   PDR/INS/WiFi integrated solution is implemented. The average accuracy of
   the proposed PDR/INS/WiFi integration algorithm achieves 4.5 m in indoor
   environments.}},

Title = {{Flow development and structural loading on dual step cylinders in
   laminar shedding regime}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The flow development over a dual step cylinder is investigated
   numerically at a Reynolds number (Re-D) of 150 for a range of aspect
   ratios, 0.2 <= L/D <= 5, and diameter ratios, 1.1 <= D/d <= 4. The
   results reveal the following four distinct types of wake topology
   downstream of the larger diameter cylinder: (i) shedding of hairpin
   vortices, (ii) transient asymmetric shedding, (iii) primarily spanwise
   shedding, and (iv) no vortex shedding. Dominant vortex interactions are
   reconstructed for each regime. These interactions, involving half-loop
   vortex connections, vortex merging, and direct vortex connections are
   shown to occur periodically as the large and small cylinder structures
   undergo vortex dislocations. Topological schematics are introduced to
   relate the characteristic frequencies to the periodic vortex
   interactions. The observed types of wake topology are shown to produce
   distinctly different mean and fluctuating forces on the dual step
   cylinder. For lower aspect and diameter ratios (L/D similar to 1 and D/d
   similar to 1.5), a reduction in fluctuating lift of up to 80\% can be
   achieved on the base cylinder with a minor reduction in mean drag
   (similar to 5\%). The results indicate that similar performance
   improvements can be sustained by attaching multiple larger diameter
   cylinders to the base cylinder. The changes in the fluid forcing are
   shown to be related to the secondary flow produced by the downwash at
   the stepwise discontinuities. This process also involves the production
   of streamwise vorticity at the steps, which is shown to be associated
   with the deformation of the main spanwise vortical structures. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Bamboo structured nitrogen-doped multiwalled carbon nanotubes
   (CNx-MWCNTs) have been successfully unzipped by a chemical oxidation
   route, resulting in nitrogen-doped graphene nanoribbons (CNx-GNRs) with
   a multifaceted microstructure. The oxidation of CNx-MWCNTs was carried
   out using potassium permanganate in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid
   or phosphoric acid. On the basis of the high resolution transmission
   electron microscopy studies, the bamboo compartments were unzipped via
   helical or dendritic mechanisms, which are different from the
   longitudinal unzipping of open channel MWCNTs. The product graphene
   oxide nanoribbons were simultaneously reduced and doped with nitrogen by
   thermal annealing in an ammonia atmosphere. The effects of the annealing
   temperature, time, and atmosphere on the doping level and types of the
   nitrogen functional groups have been investigated. X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy results indicate that a wide range of doping levels can be
   achieved (4-9 at \%) simply by changing the annealing conditions.
   Pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen functional groups were the dominant
   species that were attached to the edges of the CNx-GNRs. The GNRs, with
   a faceted structure and pyridinic and pyrrolic groups on their edges,
   have abundant nitrogen sites. These active sites could play a vital role
   in enhancing the electrocatalytic performance of GNRs.}},

Abstract = {{This work analyzes the implications of noise coupling in arrays of
   antennas on the design of low-noise amplifiers (LNAs). To select LNA
   design parameters in a manner familiar to LNA designers, the effective
   noise temperatures T eff of LNAs are presented. The effect of beamformer
   coefficients and antenna coupling on T-eff is analyzed in a manner
   similar to a stand-alone LNA analysis. This leads to the proposed LNA
   design strategy of selecting LNA Gamma(opt) near the reflection
   coefficient of antenna ports and selecting the largest practical
   vertical bar S-11 vertical bar with a proper phase. This strategy is
   based on the assumption that the antenna array may be used for various
   beamforming and nonbeamforming applications, unknown at the time of the
   design. Numerical simulations of a 38-and 41-element antenna arrays show
   that a global search of LNA S-11 and Gamma(opt), which result in the
   minimum average beamequivalent receiver noise temperature T-rec, finds
   nearly identical results to the proposed LNA design strategy. For a
   41-element array with high antenna coupling at low frequencies, the
   proposed method shows as much as 80\% improvement in the T-rec over
   conventional LNA design strategies that do not account for the intended
   use of the amplifier in an array.}},

Abstract = {{Asphaltene, resin, and maltene physical isolation procedures involving
   different alkane precipitants and solvent/sample ratios were applied in
   this work to Athabasca bitumen vacuum residue. Samples were
   characterized-by solubility profiling, size exclusion chromatography,
   fluorescence spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and
   density-viscosity analyses. Isolated fractions were found to display
   systematic property changes. Thus, it was found that denser, more polar,
   higher molecular weight (MW), more viscous, red-shifted fluorescence
   materials were sequentially ranked as follows: solvent extracted
   asphaltenes, C7 (unwashed) asphaltenes, CS (unwashed) asphaltenes,
   resins, and maltenes. Intermolecular aggregation for these fractions was
   determined to follow the same order. Decreasing contents of resins in
   the same order were found to increase aggregation phenomena. This work
   further reports on aspects of possible practical interest, i.e., the
   liquid nature of asphaltenes at 300 degrees C and the possible existence
   of oxidative reactions affecting fraction isolation that follow standard
   methods which do not contemplate inert atmospheres. Preliminary
   assessment of chemical functionalities within isolated fractions
   highlighted the possible enrichment of pyrrolic compounds within resins
   and oxygen functionalities in asphaltenes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new architecture of frequency-agile Doherty
   power amplifier (PA)-based RF front-end. This architecture incorporates
   a baseband equalizer that is implemented using finite-impulse-response
   (FIR) digital filters to improve the performance of Doherty PAs when
   driven with large bandwidth and multiband wireless radios. Depending on
   the center frequency and bandwidth of the input signal, the FIR filters
   of the proposed equalizer are synthesized to compensate for the nonideal
   frequency behavior of the RF building blocks of the Doherty PA. It is
   shown that the proposed architecture enables the Doherty PA to operate
   with significantly improved power efficiency and linearity performance
   beyond its nominal frequency of design, which is suitable for
   multistandard applications. As a matter of fact, when driven with a
   140-MHz bandwidth long-term evolution (LTE) signal centered around 2.30
   GHz, the average efficiency of a 2.14-GHz Doherty PA prototype with the
   proposed digital baseband equalizer is enhanced from 33.5\% to 44.7\%.
   Moreover, its linearity performance in terms of adjacent channel leakage
   ratio (ACLR) is improved from -21 to -26 dB. In addition, when operated
   in concurrent dual-band mode with two 20-MHz bandwidth LTE signals
   centered at 1.96 and 2.34 GHz, the proposed Doherty PA enabled a
   reduction in dc power consumption by nearly 15\%. Furthermore, it is
   demonstrated that the integration of the proposed baseband equalizer
   does not compromise the linearizability of the Doherty PA. To the best
   of the authors' knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the use of
   digital equalization for performance enhancement of RF Doherty PAs.}},

Abstract = {{This study has evaluated the swelling of meniscal test samples
   associated with altered osmotic environments. Meniscal samples were cut
   and weighed, then placed in one of 3 solutions: deionized water,
   phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or 2 x concentration PBS. The amount of
   swelling in meniscal samples was solution independent with average
   swelling greater than 20\%. The effect of this swelling on the
   mechanical properties of the samples was evaluated under confined
   compression testing. Samples were measured using a photogrammetric
   technique at the time of sample preparation and again after 1 h in PBS.
   Meniscal samples used for mechanical testing swelled on average 18\% in
   thickness after 1 h in isotonic PBS. Free-swollen tissue was 1/3 as
   stiff at equilibrium as those that were recompressed to their original
   thickness prior to testing. Secant moduli at peak stress were nine times
   greater in the recompressed samples than the free-swollen samples.
   Relaxation times were faster in swollen samples, indicating increased
   permeability compared to recompressed specimen. Swelling pressure in the
   tissue averaged 14.4 kPa in isotonic PBS, identifying that the menisci
   are pre-stressed structures within the knee joint. Histological analysis
   identified that the quantity of swelling is related to both the osmotic
   pressure generated by proteoglycans and the local collagen architecture
   in the sample. This is the first study to quantify the amount and
   swelling in meniscal test samples. This swelling behavior significantly
   influences the properties of the tissue in compression and should be
   addressed in future mechanical testing and protocol development for the
   menisci. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A focal cartilage defect involves tissue loss or rupture. Altered
   mechanics in the affected joint may play an essential role in the onset
   and progression of osteoarthritis. The objective of the present study
   was to determine the compromised load support in the human knee joint
   during defect progression from the cartilage surface to the
   cartilage-bone interface. Ten normal and defect cases were simulated
   with a previously tested 3D finite element model of the knee. The focal
   defects were considered in both condyles within high load-bearing
   regions. Fluid pressurization, anisotropic fibril-reinforcement, and
   depth-dependent mechanical properties were considered for the articular
   cartilages and menisci. The results showed that a small cartilage defect
   could cause 25\% reduction in the load support of the knee joint due to
   a reduced capacity of fluid pressurization in the defect cartilage. A
   partial-thickness defect could cause a fluid pressure decrease or
   increase in the remaining underlying cartilage depending on the defect
   depth. A cartilage defect also increased the shear strain at the
   cartilage-bone interface, which was more significant with a
   full-thickness defect. The effect of cartilage defect on the fluid
   pressurization also depended on the defect sites and contact conditions.
   In conclusion, a focal cartilage defect causes a fluid-pressure
   dependent load reallocation and a compromised load support in the joint,
   which depend on the defect depth, site, and contact condition. Copyright

Abstract = {{A model for gas transport in microfractures of shale and tight gas
   reservoirs is established. Slip flow and Knudsen diffusion are coupled
   together to describe general gas transport mechanisms, which include
   continuous flow, slip flow, transitional flow, and Knudsen diffusion.
   The ratios of the intermolecular collision frequency and the
   molecule-wall collision frequency to the total collision frequency are
   defined as the weight coefficients of slip flow and Knudsen diffusion,
   respectively. The model is validated by molecular simulation results.
   The results show that: (1) the model can reasonably describe the process
   of the mass transform of different gas transport mechanisms; (2)
   fracture geometry significantly impacts gas transport. Under the same
   fracture aperture, the higher the aspect ratio is, the stronger the gas
   transport capacity, and this phenomenon is more pronounced in the cases
   with higher gas pressure and larger fracture aperture. (c) 2015 American

Abstract = {{A new internal fault protection scheme for synchronous generators, based
   on the fuzzy inference system, is proposed. The proposed method is
   developed and tested by using an oscillogram dataset gathered from fault
   simulations and experiments conducted on real-life synchronous
   generators. Data mining is used to support the choice of the most
   relevant variables to identify synchronous generator internal faults.
   The selected variables are used as inputs to a fuzzy-logic system
   designed to identify and detect faults. A part of the oscillogram
   dataset is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   protection. The results show that the proposed protection scheme is more
   sensitive in detecting ground faults in synchronous generators with
   high-impedance grounding compared to conventional devices. It is also
   shown that the proposed scheme is able to identify interturns and
   interpath faults. The proposed method was embedded in a PC104 processor
   and tested in a real-time environment to show its practical feasibility.}},

Abstract = {{Catalytic hydrodeoxygenation of guaiacol (2-methoxy phenol), an oxygen
   rich lignin model compound, has been investigated aiming at the
   elucidation of active catalysts for production of deoxygenated products.
   All catalysts were synthesized by impregnation technique. Screening of
   different catalysts unveiled Ni-Mo/TiO2 as the most active catalyst.
   Ni-Mo/TiO2 was compared with Ni-V/TiO2 to understand the influence of
   promoter (Mo and V); nevertheless, Ni-V/TiO2 produced no positive effect
   compared to Ni-Mo/TiO2. Structural investigation was performed using
   XRD, TEM, BET surface area and TPD measurements. As evidenced by XRD and
   TEM, all catalysts composed of nano-sized particles. Ni-Mo/TiO2 showed
   small sized finely dispersed particles, on the other hand large
   particles and loss of dispersion noted for Ni-V/TiO2 and Ni/TiO2,
   respectively. BET surface area measurement depicted Ni-Mo/TiO2 catalyst
   presented high surface area with optimal mesopores than Ni-V/TiO2. The
   NH3-TPD data revealed that Ni-Mo/TiO2 acidic strength is higher than the
   Ni-V/TiO2. Influence of catalysts and reaction variables were
   investigated using both Ni-Mo/TiO2 and Ni-V/TiO2 to determine their
   potential role on guaiacol conversion. High activity of Ni-Mo/TiO2
   during wide range of conditions could be attributed to: (i) small sized
   and finely dispersed active metal particles, (ii) more mesopores, and
   (iii) high acidic strength. Water as a solvent, showed no impact on
   Ni-V/TiO2 performance, while on Ni-Mo/TiO2, guaiacol conversion and
   phenol selectivity inclined to decrease.
