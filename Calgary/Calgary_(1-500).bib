Abstract = {{Steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) is one of the most popular
   approaches for oil sands recovery. In this study, an accurate and simple
   heat efficiency calculation model is presented by modeling transient
   heat transfer involving the flow of both hot condensate and mobile
   initial water in oil sands. A 2-D numerical simulation procedure is
   proposed to calculate temperature distribution ahead of the steam
   chamber edge in SAGD. A new heat efficiency model is proposed to
   estimate heat efficiency in SAGD by using the temperature distribution
   obtained from the 2-D numerical simulation. Results indicate that
   convection dominates the heat transfer ahead of the steam chamber edge
   which is induced by condensate and initial water flow in oil sands. On
   the basis of these studies, abundant analysis shows that the heat
   efficiency of SAGD can be improved by using moderate steam injection
   pressures for the reservoir scenarios from 1 to 10 darcy permeability.}},

Abstract = {{The disinfection performance of the process of adsorption using a
   graphitic material combined with electrochemical regeneration for a
   range of microorganisms including bacteria, fungi, yeast and protozoa in
   a laboratory scale sequential batch reactor is demonstrated. The
   bacterial species studied were Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Staphylococcus
   aureus and Legionella pneumophila. A 3.0 log(10) reduction in the
   concentration of P. aeruginosa cells was achieved with the adsorbent
   that was regenerated at 30 mA cm(-2) with 100\% regeneration on each
   adsorption cycle. The process was quite effective in removing S. aureus
   present in water with a significantly higher reduction in the number of
   cells (ca. 9-log(10) reduction) at relatively low current density (10 mA
   cm(-2)). Similarly, L. pneumophila were removed from water with a ca.
   7.5-log(10) reduction in the number of bacterial cells. The SEM images
   confirmed the adsorption of L. pneumophila onto the adsorbent and its
   electrochemical regeneration at 20 mA cm(-2) that is considered a
   refractory pathogen against chlorination. The process was also found to
   be suitable for disinfecting fungal spores, Aspergillus awamori and
   yeasts including Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Rhodosporidium turoloides
   However, the removal of Cryptosporidium parvum from water was not
   demonstrated successfully. The preliminary results suggest that using a
   chloride free environment and a relatively high current density could be
   useful in disinfecting C. parvum. (C) 2016 The Korean Society of

Title = {{Development and Application of a Life Cycle-Based Model to Evaluate
   Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Oil Sands Upgrading Technologies}},

Abstract = {{A life cycle-based model, OSTUM (Oil Sands Technologies for Upgrading
   Model), which evaluates the energy intensity and greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions of current oil sands upgrading technologies, is developed.
   Upgrading converts oil sands bitumen into high quality synthetic crude
   oil (SCO), a refinery feedstock. OSTUM's novel attributes include the
   following: the breadth of technologies and upgrading operations options
   that can be analyzed, energy intensity and GHG emissions being estimated
   at the process unit level, it not being dependent on a proprietary
   process simulator, and use of publicly available data. OSTUM is applied
   to a hypothetical, but realistic, upgrading operation based on delayed
   coking, the most common upgrading technology, resulting in emissions of
   328 kg CO(2)e/m(3) SCO. The primary contributor to upgrading emissions
   (45\%) is the use of natural gas for hydrogen production through steam
   methane reforming, followed by the use of natural gas as fuel in the
   rest of the process units' heaters (39\%). OSTUM's results are in
   agreement with those of a process simulation model developed by
   CanmetENERGY, other literature, and confidential data of a commercial
   upgrading operation. For the application of the model, emissions are
   found to be most sensitive to the amount of natural gas utilized as
   feedstock by the steam methane reformer. OSTUM is capable of evaluating
   the impact of different technologies, feedstock qualities, operating
   conditions, and fuel mixes on upgrading emissions, and its life cycle
   perspective allows easy incorporation of results into well-to-wheel
   analyses.}},

Title = {{Study of the confined behavior of hydrocarbons in organic nanopores by
   the potential theory}},
Journal = {{FLUID PHASE EQUILIBRIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{429}},

Abstract = {{To accurately describe the confined behavior of hydrocarbons in
   nanopores has become a top priority for the effective development of
   unconventional resources. In this paper, the multicomponent potential
   theory of adsorption (MPTA) is coupled with the cubic Peng-Robinson (PR)
   equation of stare (EOS) to investigate and represent the confined
   behavior of pure hydrocarbons and their mixtures in organic nanopores.
   In this theory, the fluid fluid interactions are modeled by the PR EOS.
   For the fluid-solid interactions, the 10-4-3 Steele potential is used
   for slit-like nanopores, and a modified Lennard-Jones (LJ) 10-6
   potential is used for cylindrical nanopores. Then a prediction process
   for the behavior of methane, ethane, propane and their mixtures (binary
   and ternary mixtures) is performed. The results are compared against
   experimental data on the adsorbents of activated carbons (slit-like
   nanopores) and MCM-41 silica (cylindrical nanopores) to validate the
   accuracy of the theory and process. Results indicate that for the sets
   of experimental data considered in this work, the theory is capable of
   predicting the confined behavior of pure components in wide ranges of
   pressure and temperature. For pure components, because of the different
   interaction energy between fluids and solid walls, the density of
   confined fluids in the slit-like nanopores (activated carbon type) is
   much higher than that in the cylindrical nanopores (MCM-41 silica type).
   As a position (z) approaches the pore surface, the effect of fluid-solid
   interactions is enhanced, and the density of confined fluids is
   increased. For binary mixtures, the mole fraction of the heavier
   component (C2H6/C3H8) around the pore surface is extremely higher than
   that of the lighter component (CH4). The higher the difference between
   the two components, the higher the difference of the mole fractions and
   fluid densities of the two components in nanopores. For a ternary
   mixture, the confined behavior of the three components within nanopores
   is significantly different. As a position approaches the pore center,
   the mole fraction of the lightest component is increased gradually, and
   the mole fraction of the heaviest component is reduced gradually. The
   medium component shows a tendency of increasing first and reducing then.
   This investigation makes it possible to get some new insights on the
   confined behavior of hydrocarbons in nanopores with different
   geometries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Application of solvent and water assisted electrical heating for in-situ
   extraction of bitumen is demonstrated. In this process heat is provided
   to the formation using downhole electrical heaters with injection of a
   working fluid to enhance the heat transfer. As a result, a hot vapor
   chamber analogous to that created in the steam assisted gravity drainage
   (SAGD) is formed. In this study results of numerical simulations using
   water, pure solvents, and combined water and solvents as working fluids
   are presented. The solvents considered are butane, hexane, and natural
   gas condensate. It was shown that while pure solvent injection is not as
   effective as water in transferring heat, co-injection of hexane or
   condensate with water is able to accelerate production as a result of
   the dilution effect of solvent in bitumen along with effective
   convective heat transfer. The results show promise and demonstrate that
   this process has potential to entirely eliminate steam generation plant
   and significantly reduce the size of the required water treatment
   surface facilities. Many potential advantages of solvent and water
   assisted electrical heating over SAGD result from the capital and

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{186}},
Pages = {{293-304}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{A matrix pressure depletion scheme can result in pore structure
   deformation and permeability reduction in shale, which affects the
   process of gas production in shale. Shale gas production tests were
   carried out with four core samples and with two crushed samples to
   investigate the effects of three different pressure depletion schemes on
   gas production rate and on ultimate gas recovery. The three pressure
   depletion schemes tested include constant production pressure, linear
   pressure decline, and step-wise pressure decline. Results of the gas
   production tests show that, for shale core samples, a production
   pressure depletion scheme affects not only gas production rate but also
   ultimate gas recovery. Pressure sensitivity tests of the four shale core
   samples were also performed, and the results show that permeability
   reduction of shale cores due to rapid pressure depletion caused the
   decrease in ultimate gas recovery. The gas production tests with crushed
   shale samples which were under zero effective stress show that a
   pressure depletion scheme only affects the gas production rate; that is,
   the same ultimate gas recovery was obtained for different pressure
   depletion schemes. The experimental results also show that the linear
   pressure decline and step-wise pressure decline depletion schemes delay
   the permeability reduction of the shale matrix, thereby resulting in a
   greater ultimate gas recovery than the constant production pressure
   scheme in which the production pressure was dropped immediately to an
   end value. In a step-wise pressure decline depletion scheme, in which
   gas diffusion and desorption were allowed to reach equilibrium at each
   pressure step, the ultimate gas recovery increases with a decrease in
   the size of the pressure step. However, in a linear pressure decline
   depletion scheme, the maximum ultimate gas recovery is obtained with
   that optimum pressure decline rate which causes the best match between
   the permeability reduction rate and the gas diffusion and desorption
   rates. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Mathematical modeling of the solvent chamber evolution in a vapor
   extraction heavy oil recovery process}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{186}},
Pages = {{339-349}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{In a vapor extraction (VAPEX) process, a vaporized solvent (such as
   light alkanes) is injected underground to dilute and recover heavy oil.
   A solvent chamber forms due to the depletion of oil, and goes through
   three phases: rising, spreading, and falling phases during a VAPEX
   process. Existing analytical models of VAPEX can only roughly estimate
   an oil production rate but are unable to accurately describe the solvent
   chamber evolution. Simulation models are somewhat unreliable due to
   extremely small physical diffusivity and relatively large numerical
   dispersion. This study develops a comprehensive mathematical model for
   the VAPEX process to characterize a transition zone and describe the
   solvent chamber evolution. Major recovery mechanisms occurring in the
   transition zone such as dynamic mass transfer, gravity drainage,
   multiphase flow, and surface renewal are accounted for in the model.
   Modeling results show that the solvent concentration in the transition
   zone grows slower at the top than at the bottom while rather stable at
   the middle along the drainage surface. In addition, it is found that a
   stabilized oil production rate depends on the square root of a heavy
   oil-solvent effective diffusion coefficient. Moreover, this new VAPEX
   model can accurately describe the relationship between oil production
   rates and diffusion coefficients in different scales thanks to the
   absence of numerical dispersion. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper develops a stochastic geometry-based analytical approach for
   calculating the throughput reliability of a cloud-radio access network
   (C-RAN) comprising randomly distributed remote radio heads (RRHs) and
   randomly located users. A tunable distance-based RRH transmit power
   control mechanism along with cooperative joint transmissions by the RRHs
   is employed to achieve power savings and high throughput reliability.
   The analytical result for the throughput reliability serves as input to
   analysis of per user achievable average rate and C-RAN network-level
   performance metrics of spectral efficiency and energy efficiency. The
   analytical results are validated by Monte Carlo simulation results with
   good agreement, thus confirming the accuracy of the developed analytical
   approach. The key finding from the analysis is that by carefully tuning
   the RRH transmit power and cooperation parameter (cluster radius), it is
   possible to realize a threefold improvement in the energy efficiency
   along with 108\% enhancement in the spectral efficiency of C-RANs.

Title = {{Reevaluation of Performance of Electric Double-layer Capacitors from
   Constant-current Charge/Discharge and Cyclic Voltammetry}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{The electric characteristics of electric-double layer capacitors (EDLCs)
   are determined by their capacitance which is usually measured in the
   time domain from constant-current charging/discharging and cyclic
   voltammetry tests, and from the frequency domain using nonlinear
   least-squares fitting of spectral impedance. The time-voltage and
   current-voltage profiles from the first two techniques are commonly
   treated by assuming ideal SsC behavior in spite of the nonlinear
   response of the device, which in turn provides inaccurate values for its
   characteristic metrics. In this paper we revisit the calculation of
   capacitance, power and energy of EDLCs from the time domain
   constant-current step response and linear voltage waveform, under the
   assumption that the device behaves as an equivalent fractional-order
   circuit consisting of a resistance R-s in series with a constant phase
   element (CPE(Q, alpha), with Q being a pseudocapacitance and a a
   dispersion coefficient). In particular, we show with the derived (Rs, Q,
   alpha)-based expressions, that the corresponding nonlinear effects in
   voltage-time and current-voltage can be encompassed through nonlinear
   terms function of the coefficient alpha, which is not possible with the
   classical RsC model. We validate our formulae with the experimental
   measurements of different EDLCs.}},

Title = {{Relationship between increased in vivo meniscal loads and abnormal

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to quantify how abnormal dynamic tibiofemoral
   surface alignment affects the load bearing function of menisci in vivo.
   Using a sheep model of ACL deficiency, we tested the hypothesis that
   increased in vivo meniscal loads correlate with greater tibiofemoral
   surface alignment abnormality. Stifle kinematics were recorded using a
   bone-mounted instrumented spatial linkage in four sheep before, and at
   four and twenty weeks (w) after ACL transection. A parallel robotic
   manipulator was used to quantify stifle kinetics by reproducing each
   animal's in vivo kinematics and measuring tissue loads during gait.
   Meniscal resultant loads were estimated from the change in joint
   reaction force after sequentially removing load-bearing tissues.
   Tibiofemoral subchondral surfaces were then traced and modeled using
   thin plate splines. Proximity disturbance is a surface interaction
   measure used to quantify dynamic tibiofemoral surface alignment
   abnormality. ACL transection increased meniscal loads by 30-145\% at 20w
   post-ACL transection, whereas the degree of dynamic tibiofemoral
   subchondral surface alignment varied between sheep. Positive and
   significant correlations between increased meniscal loads and proximity
   disturbance values > 10 mm were observed (R-2=0.04-0.57; p <= 0.05). Our
   results suggest that the proximity disturbance measure reflects abnormal
   meniscal loads following ACL injury; however given the range of R-2
   values, perturbations in dynamic tibiofemoral subchondral surface
   alignment do not explain abnormal joint kinetics entirely, and point to
   the presence of other dynamic compensatory mechanisms that may have a
   significant bearing on in vivo joint function and long-term joint
   health. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Catalytic co-aromatization of ethanol and methane}},
Journal = {{APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{198}},
Pages = {{480-492}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{This study demonstrates the technical feasibility of simultaneously
   converting ethanol and methane into liquid hydrocarbons at mild reaction
   conditions (400 degrees C and 1 atm) over silver and/or zinc modified
   zeolite catalysts. After GC-MS analysis, it is worth noting that
   aromatics are the major compounds contained in the liquid product
   collected from the run when 1\%Ag/ZSM-5, particularly after H-2
   pretreatment, is charged. Compared to the performance exhibited from the
   run with pure HZSM-5 support engaged, Ag addition into the HZSM-5
   framework favors aromatics formation, which might be closely associated
   with better Ag dispersion and more abundance of strong surface acidic
   sites where aromatization might take place while Zn loading exerts a
   detrimental effect on the production of aromatics but promotes the ether
   generation possibly through dehydration reaction. Referred to that from
   its N-2 counterpart, the increased aromatics formation of the collected
   liquid product when methane is present indicates that methane existence
   might facilitate ethanol aromatization. Moreover, combined with the
   increased carbon number in the formed aromatics from CH4 run when H-2
   run is referred and zero liquid formation from CH4-alone test as well as
   more prominent endothermic feature of methane run and more importantly
   the notably increased C-13 signals in C-13 NMR spectra of the liquid
   product collected during ethanol conversion under (CH4)-C-13
   environment, all the observations suggest that methane might be
   activated nonoxidadvely and converted into higher hydrocarbons,
   preferentially into aromatics if suitable catalyst is charged under the
   assistance of co-existing oxygenated hydrocarbon. The reported
   synergetic effect could potentially lead to the more economic
   utilization of abundant natural gas and cellulosic ethanol. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In this paper, the modeling of developers' assignment to bugs (DAB) is
   studied. The problem is modeled both as a single objective (minimize bug
   fix time) and as a bi-objective (minimize bug fix time and cost)
   combinatorial optimization problem. Two models of developer assignment
   are considered where in the first model a single developer is assigned
   per bug (single developer model), while in the second model a single
   developer is assigned for each competency area of a bug (individual
   competency model). The latter model is proposed in this paper. For the
   single developer model, GA@DAB, an existing genetic algorithm-based
   approach, is extended to support precedence among bugs. For the
   individual competency model of DAB, one genetic algorithm-based approach
   (Competence@DAB) and one nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II-based
   approach (CompetenceMulti2@DAB) are proposed to generate solutions
   minimizing time and minimizing both time and cost, respectively. The
   performance of the proposed approaches was evaluated for 2040 bugs of 19
   open-source milestone projects from the ECLIPSE platform. Our results
   and analysis show that the proposed individual competency model is far
   better than the single developer model, with average bug fix time
   reduction of 39.7\% across all projects. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley

Title = {{Characteristics of distinct flow regimes in the wake of an infinite span

Abstract = {{The wake of an infinite, two-dimensional (2D), thin flat plate of height
   h was studied using Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) for two Reynolds
   numbers, Re = 1.2 x 10(3) and 2.4 x 10(3). The vortex shedding Strouhal
   number was 0.158. In addition to the high - and low - intensity shedding
   regimes (H and L) first reported by Najjar and Balachandar (1998), a
   distinct period of reorganization (M) is identified following regime H.
   The average flow characteristics for regime M are similar to those of
   the long-term mean flow. The regime-averaged recirculation length at Re
   = 1.2 x 10(3) was 2.16h during H, 3.60h during L and 2.81h during M.
   Whereas the spanwise vortex rollers are well-organized during both
   regimes H and M, the arrangement of the streamwise ribs is much more
   regular and can be observed further downstream in regime H than M. The
   flow is highly three-dimensional during regime L, which includes
   less-coherent vortex rollers and spanwise randomly distributed ribs. The
   impact of this behavior on the roll-up, and thus the extension of the
   shear layer, is identified as a driving mechanism for generation and
   sustainability of the periodic wake behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{Probabilistic Evaluation of Causal Relationship between Variables for
   Water Quality Management}},

Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{In aquatic environments, a complex interplay exists among physical,
   chemical, and biological water quality characteristics, which are
   constantly influenced by exogenous factors such as hydrological,
   meteorological and geological conditions. Due to the spatial and
   temporal variations of exogenous factors, the relationship between the
   water quality parameters and these factors hence becomes complicated and
   challenging. Given the large data matrix, one type of methods frequently
   seen in the literature belongs to the multivariate analysis which
   generates a qualitative measure of the relationships among variables in
   a geometrically intuitive way. However, a quantitative evaluation from a
   probabilistic perspective is favorable since it defines a measurable
   causality among variables so that more efficient water management
   strategies can be formulated. This paper illustrates a new way to
   discover the relationship between two variables by estimating their
   joint distribution which fully interprets the statistical dependence. A
   multivariate Gaussian mixture model was employed to describe the data.
   The model parameters were determined using the previously developed
   estimation approach, which is capable of dealing with both multivariate
   variables and censored data. The joint distribution and the conditional
   distribution were computed and used to describe the statistical
   distribution of water quality parameters, which are subject to the
   effects of hydro meteorological conditions. The method was demonstrated
   by a case study on the Bow River in Alberta, Canada. The results shed
   light on how one variable affects the distribution of the other variable
   under complex environments in a probabilistic context.}},

Abstract = {{This letter presents a profile-based wireless fingerprinting method,

   historical trajectories from dead-reckoning. This approach extends the
   fingerprint from one dimension to multiple, and thus enriches its
   diversity. Meanwhile, the multi-dimensional dynamic time warping method
   is introduced for matching multi-dimensional fingerprints with
   inaccurate profile lengths. Compared with the traditional single-point
   matching method, the profile-matching method provides a more reliable
   solution especially in environments with sparse distributed access
   points and a more accurate initial position. Indoor walking tests with
   two smartphones, in two buildings, and under four motion conditions
   illustrated that the proposed profile-matching method reduced the
   position errors by 11.5-21.6 \%.}},

Abstract = {{This study develops an integrated data-driven and model-driven approach
   (template matching) that clusters the urban railroad point clouds into
   three classes of rail track, contact cable, and catenary cable. The
   employed dataset covers 630 m of the Dutch urban railroad corridors in
   which there are four rail tracks, two contact cables, and two catenary
   cables. The dataset includes only geometrical information (three
   dimensional (3D) coordinates of the points) with no intensity data and
   no RGB data. The obtained results indicate that all objects of interest
   are successfully classified at the object level with no false positives
   and no false negatives. The results also show that an average 97.3\%
   precision and an average 97.7\% accuracy at the point cloud level are
   achieved. The high precision and high accuracy of the rail track
   classification (both greater than 96\%) at the point cloud level stems
   from the great impact of the employed template matching method on
   excluding the false positives. The cables also achieve quite high
   average precision (96.8\%) and accuracy (98.4\%) due to their high
   sampling and isolated position in the railroad corridor.}},

Title = {{MEMS IMU Error Mitigation Using Rotation Modulation Technique}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) inertial measurement unit (IMU)
   outputs are corrupted by significant sensor errors. The navigation
   errors of a MEMS-based inertial navigation system will therefore
   accumulate very quickly over time. This requires aiding from other
   sensors such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). However, it
   will still remain a significant challenge in the presence of GNSS
   outages, which are typically in urban canopies. This paper proposed a
   rotary inertial navigation system (INS) to mitigate navigation errors
   caused by MEMS inertial sensor errors when external aiding information
   is not available. A rotary INS is an inertial navigator in which the IMU
   is installed on a rotation platform. Application of proper rotation
   schemes can effectively cancel and reduce sensor errors. A rotary INS
   has the potential to significantly increase the time period that INS can
   bridge GNSS outages and make MEMS IMU possible to maintain longer
   autonomous navigation performance when there is no external aiding. In
   this research, several IMU rotation schemes (rotation about X-, Y-and
   Z-axes) are analyzed to mitigate the navigation errors caused by MEMS
   IMU sensor errors. As the IMU rotation induces additional sensor errors,
   a calibration process is proposed to remove the induced errors. Tests
   are further conducted with two MEMS IMUs installed on a tri-axial
   rotation table to verify the error mitigation by IMU rotations.}},

Abstract = {{The degradation of benzene, a carcinogenic air pollutant, was studied in
   a gas-phase photochemical reactor with an amalgam lamp emitting
   ultraviolet light at 185 and 254 nm. Efficient benzene degradation
   (>70\%) was possible for benzene mass flow rates of up to 1.5
   mg.min(-1). Adding ozone allowed benzene mass flow rates of up to 5
   mg.min(-1) to be treated with the same efficiency. In terms of energy
   consumption, ozone doubles the efficiency of the process. A
   comprehensive mechanistic simulation model was developed incorporating a
   chemical kinetics model (62 reactions involving 47 chemical species), a
   material balance model incorporating diffusion and flow, a flow velocity
   model, and a light field model. The model successfully predicted the
   efficiency of the reactor, generally within 20\%, which indicates that
   the model is sound, and can be used for feasibility studies. The
   prediction of the reactor efficiency in the presence of ozone was less
   successful, with systematically overestimated efficiency. Condensation
   of reaction products in the reactor is thought to be the main cause of
   model inaccuracy. Both experimental data and model predictions show that
   there is a synergistic effect between ozonation and ultraviolet
   degradation. (C) Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin

Abstract = {{Objectives: To examine the effects of shoe type and stride length
   reduction on lower-extremity running mechanics and cumulative loading.
   Design: Within-subject with four conditions: (1) control shoe at
   preferred stride length; (2) control shoe at 90\% preferred stride
   length; (3) minimalist shoe at preferred stride length; (4) minimalist
   shoe at 90\% preferred stride length.
   Methods: Fourteen young healthy males ran overground at their preferred
   speed while motion capture, force platform, and plantar pressure data
   were collected. Peak moments, impulse, mechanical work, and cumulative
   impulse were calculated at the metatarsophalangeal, ankle, and knee
   joint, and compared between conditions using a 2 x 2 factor repeated
   measures ANOVA.
   Results: In general, running in minimalist footwear increased measures
   of loading at the metatarsophalangeal joint and ankle joint (mean
   increases of 7.3\% and 5.9\%, respectively), but decreased measures of
   loading at the knee (mean decrease of 7.3\%). Conversely, running with
   reduced stride length decreased single-stance measures of loading at the
   ankle and knee joint (ranging from -0.9\% to -20.5\%), though cumulative
   impulse was higher at the ankle and lower at the knee.
   Conclusions: Running in minimalist shoes increased loads at the
   metatarsophalangeal and ankle joint, which may explain some of the
   incidence of overuse injuries observed in minimalist shoe users.
   Decreased ankle loads at 90\% preferred stride length were not
   necessarily sufficient to reduce cumulative loads when impulse and
   loading cycles were weighted equally. Knee loads decreased more when
   running at 90\% preferred stride length (16.2\% mean reduction) versus
   running in a minimalist shoe (7.3\% mean reduction), but both load
   reduction mechanisms appeared to have an additive effect (22.2\% mean
   reduction). (C) 2016 Sports Medicine Australia. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{This work examines the effects of kinetic parameters on the assembly of
   copper nanowires (CuNWs) in discrete phases and at the interface in two
   distinct blend systems: a high interfacial tension blend of poly(lactic
   acid), PLA, flow density polyethylene (LDPE) and a low interfacial
   tension blend of PLA/poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate), PBAT.
   CuNWs were synthesized through electrodeposition in a porous alumina
   oxide template. Considering the surface polarity of polymer melts and
   the hydrophilicity of the surface of CUNWs, the particles should be
   located in the more polar phase (PLA in PLA/LDPE or PBAT in PLA/PBAT).
   TEM images confirm that when CuNWs are initially premixed with the more
   polar phase, they remain in that phase in a stable fashion irrespective
   of the interfacial tension of the system. However, when the particles
   are premixed with the less polar phase, to investigate kinetic effects,
   different behaviors are observed; in PLA/LDPE blends, CuNWs partition
   between both phases, while in PLA/PBAT blends, CuNWs assemble at the
   interface and in the less polar PLA phase. The effects of mixing time
   and shear rate on these phenomena are examined, and importantly, for the
   low interfacial tension PLA/PBAT blend, it is shown that CuNWs can be
   assembled in a stable fashion at the interface. The mechanism of
   interfacial assembly of these cylindrically shaped CuNWs in PLA/PBAT is
   the result of enhanced bulk migration in the less polar PLA phase and
   slow migration rate across the interface. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel broadband Doherty power amplifier based on the
   continuous-mode technique (C-DPA) is proposed. The amplifier is focused
   on manipulating harmonic components in a Doherty power amplifier (DPA)
   structure to achieve improved bandwidth and efficiency. In a
   conventional DPA, harmonic isolation is typically required between the
   two transistors to prevent them from modulating each other at harmonic
   frequencies. However, as presented in this paper, such isolation is not
   actually necessary. On the contrary, by allowing the two transistors to
   modulate each other at harmonic frequencies with the help of a properly
   designed postharmonic tuning network, a series of highly efficient DPA
   modes can be created over a continuous frequency band, leading to a
   broadband C-DPA. Based on the proposed method, an example of a C-DPA
   working from 1.65 to 2.75 GHz was designed. According to the measured
   results, the designed C-DPA exhibits a 52\%-66\% efficiency at a -6 dB
   power backoff and a power utilization factor higher than 1.08 over the
   1.1-GHz band. In addition, when simulated by a 7.5-dB peak-to-average
   power ratio 20-MHz LTE signal, the example C-DPA exhibits an efficiency
   of 46\%-62\% while maintaining an adjacent channel power ratio below -45
   dBc after linearization over the full 1.1-GHz band. To the best of our
   knowledge, this is the first proposed C-DPA and a state-of-the-art
   performance for broadband DPAs.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, analytical expressions for the channel capacity, channel
   cutoff rate, and achievable bandwidth efficiency associated with M-ary
   signaling and Joint Fading Two-path Shadowing (JFTS) fading/shadowing
   channel model that characterize mobility-constrained indoor propagation
   scenarios are derived. Expressions for the bandwidth efficiency of a
   JFTS fading channel involve infinite-series summation since the
   probability density function of the JFTS signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
   contains infinite series. We derive lower and upper bounds on the errors
   resulting from truncating the infinite series in the bandwidth
   efficiency expression. The cutoff rate and bandwidth efficiency analysis
   can be used to demonstrate how much throughput can be practically
   achieved when M-ary signaling techniques are implemented over indoor
   composite fading/shadowing channel conditions. Simulation results show
   that in order to achieve 3 bits/symbol, the average SNR for a
   16-quadrature-amplitude-modulation (16-QAM) system requires almost 10 dB
   more for a JFTS channel model compared with a traditional Rayleigh
   channel model, thus reinforcing the necessity of using proper channel
   models for indoor communication systems.}},

Abstract = {{Shale gas is produced by gas transport under constant reservoir
   temperature and down hole pressure conditions. Therefore, it is of great
   importance to study the dynamic gas adsorption/desorption-diffusion
   process in shale, under isothermal and constant production pressure
   conditions. Accordingly, a new experimental method and apparatus has
   been designed and tested for studying shale gas transport behavior. The
   essence of the method includes accurately measuring the gas going into
   or coming out of a shale sample with respect to time. The accuracy and
   sensitivity of the method are confirmed by conducting experiments with
   methane and helium, and comparing the outcomes from adsorption isotherm
   obtained using the traditional constant-volume method. With this newly
   designed method, a two-stage transport process was observed by comparing
   the dynamic gas transport of N-2 and CH4. Free gas transports first due
   to the pressure gradient, which is followed by the desorption and
   transportation of the adsorbed gas. Besides, tests under five pressures
   were conducted. It is found that for the same differential pressure,
   higher external pressure could accelerate the process while decrease the
   amount of transported gas. Finally, the dynamic adsorption diffusion
   (DAD) mathematical model is presented to analyze the gas transport
   mechanisms in shale depicting the adsorption/desorption diffusion
   process under isothermal and constant external pressure. By calculating
   the production rate for free gas and adsorbed gas, the two stages of the
   transport process can be identified. This study provides a
   straightforward method to experimentally determine the dynamic gas
   adsorption/desorption diffusion process in shale, which is a relatively
   simple but information rich technique for the assessment of shale gas
   targets.}},

Abstract = {{Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) spectra were measured for
   16 distillation cuts obtained from two bitumens using a deep vacuum
   fractionation apparatus. Three regions of the spectra were deconvoluted
   into peaks each associated with a known type of vibration: (1) aliphatic
   C-H stretching in the 2800-3000 cm(-1) region, (2) aliphatic C-H
   scissoring/symmetric deformation in the 1350-1400 cm(-1) region, and (3)
   aromatic C-H out-of-plane bending in the 680-900 cm(-1) region. The
   distribution of chemical structures in the oils were assessed, and
   preliminary correlations were identified between measured physical
   properties (density, atomic H/C ratio, and molecular weight) and the
   quantified peak areas obtained from the FTIR spectra. A preliminary
   method was proposed to generate physical property distribution data for
   crude oils based on distillation and FTIR data. The method predicted the
   density, atomic H/C ratio, and molecular weight of the distillation
   cuts, with average deviations less than 0.8, 1.4, and 16\%,

Abstract = {{Bitumen extracted from oil sands which is abundant in Canada needs to be
   partially upgraded to meet pipeline specifications before being sent to
   downstream refineries. Hydrotreating where expensive hydrogen is
   involved at high pressure (15-20 MPa) is commonly employed as the
   technique to satisfy the upgrading requirement. In this study, it is
   reported that a partially upgraded crude oil can be readily produced
   from bitumen under a methane environment at mild conditions (400 degrees
   C and 3 MPa) without H-2 engagement under the facilitation of
   1\%Ag-5\%Mo-10\%Ce/ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 23:1). Moreover, methane participation
   into the upgrading process was evidenced by model compound reactions
   employing n-butylbenzene as a model compound to typify heavy oil and
   clearly observed in H-1 and D-2 NMR spectra when CD4 was engaged as the
   methane source. Through extensive catalyst characterizations using TEM,
   XRD, and XPS, the excellent catalytic upgrading performance might be
   closely related to the highly dispersed silver and molybdenum oxide on
   the zeolite support at reduced oxidation state for better methane
   activation and partially reduced cerium oxide for coke reduction owing
   to its high oxygen mobility. The outcomes from this research could not
   only create an innovative route for more profitable natural gas
   utilization but also benefit bitumen partial upgrading in a more
   economical and environmentally friendly way.}},

Title = {{Simulation of air-steam gasification of woody biomass in a bubbling

   pyrolysis, hydrodynamics and tar production}},
Journal = {{BIOMASS \& BIOENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A comprehensive model was developed to simulate gasification of pine
   sawdust in the presence of both air and steam. The proposed model
   improved upon the premise of an existing ASPEN PLUS-based biomass
   gasification model. These enhancements include the addition of a
   temperature-dependent pyrolysis model, an updated hydrodynamic model,
   more extensive gasification kinetics and the inclusion of tar formation
   and reaction kinetics. ASPEN PLUS was similarly used to simulate this
   process; however, a more extensive FORTRAN subroutine was applied to
   appropriately model the complexities of a Bubbling Fluidized Bed
   ({''}BFB{''}) gasifier. To confirm validity, the accuracy of the model's
   predictions was compared with actual experimental results. In addition,
   the relative accuracy of the comprehensive model was compared to the
   original base-model to see if any improvement had been made.
   Results show that the model predicts H-2, CO, CO2, and CH4 composition
   with reasonable accuracy in varying temperature, steam-to-biomass, and
   equivalence ratio conditions. Mean error between predicted and
   experimental results is calculated to range from 6.1\% to 37.6\%.
   Highest relative accuracy was obtained in CO composition prediction
   while the results with the least accuracy were for CH4 and CO2
   estimation at changing steam-to-biomass ratios and equivalence ratios.
   When compared to the original model, the comprehensive model predictions
   of H-2 and CO molar fractions are more accurate than those of CO2 and
   CH4. For CO2 and CH4, the original model predicted with comparable or
   better accuracy when varying steam-to-biomass ratio and equivalence
   ratios but the comprehensive model performed better at varying
   temperatures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The diffusion coefficient (D) of gases in heavy oils is an important
   mass transfer parameter to model and design gas injection processes for
   oil recovery. The pressure-decay technique (PDT) is one of the widely
   used experimental methods available to infer this coefficient. PDT
   records the declining gas phase pressure resulting from the diffusion of
   gas into heavy oil inside a pressure/volume/temperature (PVT) cell.
   Commonly, the gas phase pressure decay is modelled by use of Fick's
   second law along with gas-phase mass balance equations and assuming a
   constant diffusion coefficient. In this work, we evaluate two
   concentration-dependent diffusion coefficient functions, power-law and
   exponential. A simple history matching technique is used to estimate the
   apparent diffusion coefficient (D-o) and concentration dependency factor
   (m(a)) from pressure-decay data. Extensive application of our method to
   experimental pressure-decay tests shows that in addition to constant
   diffusion coefficients, both power-law and exponential functions are
   capable of predicting the experimental data. This implies that other
   experimental techniques are required to extract the functionality of
   diffusion coefficients with gas concentrations in heavy oil.}},

Abstract = {{Bioprosthetic aortic valves (BAVs) are becoming the prostheses of choice
   in heart valve replacement. The objective of this paper is to assess the
   effects of leaflet geometry on the mechanics and hemodynamics of BAVs in
   a fluid structure interaction model. The curvature and angle of leaflets
   were varied in 10 case studies whereby the following design parameters
   were altered: a circular arch, a line, and a parabola for the radial
   curvature, and a circular arch, a spline, and a parabola for the
   circumferential curvature. Six different leaflet angles (representative
   of the inclination of the leaflets toward the surrounding aortic wall)
   were analyzed. The 3-dimensional geometry of the models were created
   using SolidWorks, Pointwise was used for meshing, and Comsol
   Multiphysics was used for implicit finite element calculations.
   Realistic loading was enforced by considering the time-dependent
   strongly-coupled interaction between blood flow and leaflets. Higher
   mean pressure gradients as well as von Mises stresses were obtained with
   a parabolic or circular curvature for radial curvature or a parabolic or
   spline curvature for the circumferential curvature. A smaller leaflet
   angle was associated with a lower pressure gradient, and, a lower von
   Mises stress. The leaflet curvature and angle noticeably affected the
   speed of valve opening, and closing. When a parabola was used for
   circumferential or radial curvature, leaflets displacements were
   asymmetric, and they opened and closed more slowly. A circular
   circumferential leaflet curvature, a linear leaflet radial curvature,
   and leaflet inclination toward the surrounding aortic wall were
   associated with superior BAVs mechanics.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a mechanistic model was developed to predict the corrosion
   rate of steel tubing under carbon storage conditions. The model
   integrates a number of sub-models that quantify contributions of
   interrelated steps to the corrosion process. The water chemistry
   sub-model determines the solution pH and the concentrations of species.
   The electrochemical corrosion sub-model assesses both charge-transfer
   and mass-transfer steps and their effects on corrosion. The scale
   formation and its role in corrosion are considered. The finite
   difference method is used to solve numerical equations, and a MetLab
   program was written for computation of the corrosion rate. The modeling
   results are validated by both laboratory testing and literature data.
   The parametric effects, including temperature, CO2 partial pressure,
   solution salinity, pH, time, etc., on corrosion are predicted. The
   limitations of the model are also discussed. (C) 2016 Society of

Abstract = {{Emerging wide-band communications and spectrum-sensing systems demand
   support for multiple electronically scanned beams while maintaining a
   frequency independent, constant far-field beam width. Realizing existing
   phased-array technology on a digital scale is computationally intensive.
   Moreover, digitizing wide-band signals at Nyquist rate requires complex
   high-speed analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), which is challenging for
   real developments driven by the current ADC technology. A low-complexity
   alternative proposed in this paper is the use of radio-frequency (RF)
   channelizers for spectrum division followed by sub-sampling of the RF
   sub-bands, which results in extensive reduction of the necessary ADC
   operative frequency. The RF-channelized array signals are directionally
   filtered using 2-D digital filterbanks. This mixed-domain RF/digital
   aperture array allows sub-sampling, without utilizing multi-rate 2-D
   systolic arrays, which are difficult to realize in practice. Simulated
   examples showing 14-19dB of rejection of wide-band interference and
   noise for a processed bandwidth of 1.6GHz are demonstrated. The sampling
   rate is 400MHz. The proposed VLSI hardware uses a single-phase clock
   signal of 400MHz. Prototype hardware realizations and measurement using
   65-nm Xilinx field-programmable gate arrays, as well as Cadence RTL
   synthesis results including gate counts, area-time complexity, and
   dynamic power consumption for a 45-nm CMOS circuit operating at B-DC=1.1

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) creates health benefits for some while
   for others, no benefit or even adverse events. Understanding these
   differential responses is important to optimize patient care and safety.
   Toward this, characterizing how loads created by SMT relate to those
   created by typical motions is fundamental. Using robotic testing, it is
   now possible to make these comparisons to determine if SMT generates
   unique loading scenarios. In 12 porcine cadavers, SMT and passive
   motions were applied to the L3/L4 segment and the resulting kinematics
   tracked. The L3/L4 segment was removed, mounted in a parallel robot and
   kinematics of SMT and passive movements replayed robotically. The
   resulting forces experienced by L3/L4 were collected. Overall, SMT
   created both significantly greater and smaller loads compared to passive
   motions, with SMT generating greater anterioposterior peak force (the
   direction of force application) compared to all passive motions. In some
   comparisons, SMT did not create significantly different loads in the
   intact specimen, but did so in specific spinal tissues. Despite
   methodological differences between studies, SMT forces and loading rates
   fell below published injury values. Future studies are warranted to
   understand if loading scenarios unique to SMT confer its differential
   therapeutic effects.}},

Abstract = {{We present an economic evaluation of natural gas decarbonization (NGD)
   applied to reduce CO2 emissions from oil sands recovery processes. NGD
   produces hydrogen by removing carbon from natural gas (NG) fuel and
   generates valuable carbon black product instead of the unwanted CO2
   emissions. The produced hydrogen is used to generate steam by
   combustion, a process that produces water, which offsets a significant
   fraction of process water losses from bitumen recovery. Significant
   energy and cost penalties are associated with processes that reduce CO2
   emissions, and the process described here is no exception. The research
   documented in this paper is a first attempt at evaluating the economic
   viability of an integrated NGD and bitumen recovery process. The
   energetics and economics of a combined oxycombustion and NGD are
   assessed and compared with the conventional steam assisted gravity
   drainage (SAGD) on the basis of energy efficiency and economic
   viability. Other factors considered are the effect of oil prices, CO2
   tax and credits, and potential revenues from the carbon black product.
   The findings from this study are also useful in broadening the
   discussion on the factors that affect the development and commercial
   deployment of decarbonization technologies under carbon regulations in
   Alberta, Canada. This study and its findings, though at a preliminary
   stage, would help prospective investors and the oil sands industry to
   make investment decisions towards research and development and
   commercialization of this technology. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{116}},

Abstract = {{A variety of policies have driven escalated global growth of wind-power
   generation in recent years. However, wind production should be supported
   through market-based schemes that avoid overcompensation. The present
   paper aims to determine a justified support scheme for upcoming wind
   farms in competitive electricity markets. Clustering tools and
   non-parametric regression algorithms are employed to model the
   price-formation process in the market and estimate the revenue of
   forthcoming wind facilities. Accordingly, the premium paid to an
   upcoming wind farm is calculated by incorporating its estimated revenue
   and levelized cost of energy. Then, the impact of the proposed wind
   project on wholesale and retail electricity prices is modelled based on
   the achieved non-parametric regression models. The methodology is
   applied to two wind farms in the Alberta and Ontario electricity markets
   in Canada as the case studies. Our results indicate that electricity
   consumers in Ontario should pay a higher premium for each unit of energy
   generated by the wind farm due to its lower revenue from the market.
   However, it is observed in both markets that the impact of wind farms on
   wholesale prices exceed the remuneration paid to them and thus,
   electricity consumers experience a decrease in their ultimate
   electricity costs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The nature of the stress tensor for an unsaturated pendular-state
   granular medium is investigated by following two micromechanical
   approaches. Firstly, a stress tensor is analytically derived through
   stress-homogenization of the medium with internal surfaces being
   explicitly incorporated in addition to the solid, liquid, and gaseous
   volumes. As such, the derivation identifies a surface stress tensor
   associated with the liquid-gas interface endowed with distributed
   surface tension forces. Secondly, numerical simulations of unsaturated
   conditions are pursued within the discrete element method (DEM) which
   can only consider resultant point forces, whereas actual internal forces
   are indeed distributed in nature, e.g.,the liquid pressure which acts
   over the wetted surfaces. Despite this shortcoming, stress descriptions
   provided by these two fundamentally distinct approaches are found to be
   equivalent for unsaturated media subjected to mechanical and hydraulic
   loading in the pendular regime. Moreover, both approaches indicate that
   the capillary stress, interpreted as the part of the total stress
   representing the combined effects of the liquid and gas phases and
   interfaces, is driven by the microstructure and is thus generally
   nonspherical.}},

Abstract = {{The mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) is one of the most extraordinary
   mountaineers in the animal kingdom. While observational descriptions
   exist to indicate factors that may influence their climbing ability,
   these have never been assessed biomechanically. Here, we describe
   whole-body motion of a mountain goat during ascent of a 45 degrees
   incline based on a video recording in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, and
   discuss the results in a mechanical context. During the push-off phase,
   the hindlimb extended and the forelimb was tucked close to the torso.
   During the pull-up phase, the hindlimb was raised near to the torso,
   while the forelimb humerus seemed to ``lock{''} in a constant position
   relative to the torso, allowing the elbow to be held in close proximity
   to the whole-body center of mass. Extension of the elbow and carpal
   joints resulted in a vertical translation of the center of mass up the
   mountain slope. Based on the observations from this naturalistic study,
   hypotheses for future controlled studies of mountain goat climbing
   mechanics are proposed. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a weak Galerkin finite element method for the Oseen
   equations of incompressible fluid flow is proposed and investigated.
   This method is based on weak gradient and divergence operators which are
   designed for the finite element discontinuous functions. Moreover, by
   choosing the usual polynomials of degree i aeyen 1 for the velocity and
   polynomials of degree i - 1 for the pressure and enhancing the
   polynomials of degree i - 1 on the interface of a finite element
   partition for the velocity, this new method has a lot of attractive
   computational features: more general finite element partitions of
   arbitrary polygons or polyhedra with certain shape regularity, fewer
   degrees of freedom and parameter free. Stability and error estimates of
   optimal order are obtained by defining a weak convection term. Finally,
   a series of numerical experiments are given to show that this method has
   good stability and accuracy for the Oseen problem.}},

Abstract = {{Spontaneous fluctuations of blood-oxygenation level-dependent functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) signals are highly synchronous
   between brain regions that serve similar functions. This provides a
   means to investigate functional networks; however, most analysis
   techniques assume functional connections are constant over time. This
   may be problematic in the case of neurological disease, where functional
   connections may be highly variable. Recently, several methods have been
   proposed to determine moment-to-moment changes in the strength of
   functional connections over an imaging session (so called dynamic
   connectivity). Here a novel analysis framework based on a hierarchical
   observation modeling approach was proposed, to permit statistical
   inference of the presence of dynamic connectivity. A two-level linear
   model composed of overlapping sliding windows of fMRI signals,
   incorporating the fact that overlapping windows are not independent was
   described. To test this approach, datasets were synthesized whereby
   functional connectivity was either constant (significant or
   insignificant) or modulated by an external input. The method
   successfully determines the statistical significance of a functional
   connection in phase with the modulation, and it exhibits greater
   sensitivity and specificity in detecting regions with variable
   connectivity, when compared with sliding-window correlation analysis.
   For real data, this technique possesses greater reproducibility and
   provides a more discriminative estimate of dynamic connectivity than
   sliding-window correlation analysis. Hum Brain Mapp 37:4566-4580, 2016.

Title = {{Local Diameter, Wall Stress, and Thrombus Thickness Influence the Local
   Growth of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate the influence of the local diameter, the
   intraluminal thrombus (ILT) thickness, and wall stress on the local
   growth rate of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Methods: The infrarenal
   aortas of 90 asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) patients (mean
   age 70 years; 77 men) were retrospectively reconstructed from at least 2
   computed tomography angiography scans (median follow-up of 1 year) and
   biomechanically analyzed with the finite element method. Each individual
   AAA model was automatically sliced orthogonally to the lumen centerline
   and represented by 100 cross sections with corresponding diameters, ILT
   thicknesses, and wall stresses. The data were grouped according to these
   parameters for comparison of differences among the variables. Results:
   Diameter growth was continuously distributed over the entire aneurysm
   sac, reaching absolute and relative median peaks of 3.06 mm/y and
   7.3\%/y, respectively. The local growth rate was dependent on the local
   baseline diameter, the local ILT thickness, and for wall segments not
   covered by ILT, also on the local wall stress level (all p<0.001). For
   wall segments that were covered by a thick ILT layer, wall stress did
   not affect the growth rate (p=0.08). Conclusion: Diameter is not only a
   strong global predictor but also a local predictor of aneurysm growth.
   In addition, and independent of the diameter, the ILT thickness and wall
   stress (for the ILT-free wall) also influence the local growth rate. The
   high stress sensitivity of nondilated aortic walls suggests that wall
   stress peaks could initiate AAA formation. In contrast, local diameters
   and ILT thicknesses determine AAA growth for dilated and ILT-covered
   aortic walls.}},

Title = {{Hollow Blades for Small Wind Turbines Operating at High Altitudes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOLAR ENERGY ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Since the air density reduces as altitude increases, operation of small
   wind turbines (SWTs), which usually have no pitch adjustment, remains
   challenging at high altitudes due largely to the reduction of starting
   aerodynamic torque. By reducing the moment of inertia through the use of
   hollow blades, this study aims to speed up the starting while
   maintaining the structural integrity of the blades and high output
   power. A horizontal axis turbine with hollow blades was designed for two
   sites in Iran with altitude of 500m and 3000 m. The design variables are
   the distributions of the chord, twist, and shell thickness and the
   improvement of output power and starting are the design goals.
   Bladeelement momentum (BEM) theory was employed to calculate these goals
   and beam theory was used for the structural analysis to investigate
   whether the hollow timber blades could withstand the aerodynamic and
   centrifugal forces. A combination of the goals formed the objective
   function and a genetic algorithm (GA) was used to find a blade whose
   output power at a predetermined tip speed ratio (TSR) and the starting
   performance were high while the stress limit was met. The results show
   that hollow blades have starting times shorter than solid ones by
   approximately 70\%. However, in the presence of generator resistive
   torque, the algorithm could not find a blade for an altitude of 3000 m.
   To solve that problem, the tip speed ratio was added to other design
   variables and another optimization was done which led to the optimal
   blades for both altitudes.}},

Title = {{A simple dilation-recompaction model for hydraulic fracturing}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF UNCONVENTIONAL OIL AND GAS RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Pages = {{62-75}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Production of unconventional oil and gas resources has played a
   significant role on the global energy supply, of which tight oil and gas
   reservoirs are drawing greater focus. The key enabler behind tight oil
   and gas production has been multi-stage hydraulic fracturing along
   extended reach horizontal wells. Despite many advances in multistage
   fracturing, it still remains unclear how to model the hydraulic
   fracturing process to provide the basis to optimize and predict the
   properties of fracture networks and associated enhancement of fluid
   production. In typical reservoir simulation practice, the conventional
   way to represent the hydraulic fracture is to place high permeability
   planes around the horizontal well - this means that the user has
   prescribed the orientation and length scale of the fracture before the
   simulation has started. In the research documented here, we explore a
   dynamic fracturing approach that uses a dilation-recompaction model in a
   reservoir simulator to model hydraulic fracturing. The key strength of
   the approach is that the geometry and length scale of the fracture is
   not prescribed a priori. The results of the simulation show that
   dilation-recompaction model is capable of modeling the hydraulic
   fracturing process prior to the flow-back and production. The oil, gas,
   and water rates of the model are well matched to the field data and the
   extent of the fractured zone predicted by the model is reasonable. (C)

Abstract = {{Compressed natural gas (CNG) is considered to be a ``cleaner{''} fuel
   compared to other fossil fuels. Therefore, it is used as an alternative
   fuel in motor vehicles to reduce emissions of air pollutants in
   transportation. To quantify ``how clean{''} burning CNG is compared to
   burning gasoline, quantification of pollutant emissions under the same
   driving conditions for motor vehicles with different fuels is needed. In
   this study, a fleet of bi-fuel vehicles was selected to measure the
   emissions of black carbon (BC), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC)
   and nitrogen oxide (NOx) for driving in CNG mode and gasoline mode
   respectively under the same set of constant speeds and accelerations.
   Comparison of emission factors (EFs) for the vehicles burning CNG and
   gasoline are discussed. This part of the paper series reports BC EFs for
   bi-fuel vehicles driving on the real road, which were measured using an
   in situ method. Our results show that burning CNG will lead to 54\%-83\%
   reduction in BC emissions per kilometer, depending on actual driving
   conditions. These comparisons show that CNG is a cleaner fuel than
   gasoline for motor vehicles in terms of BC emissions and provide a
   viable option for reducing BC emissions cause by transportation. (C)

Abstract = {{While seeking for global suppliers is a general trend for lower cost and
   better quality, it is not trivial for a company to assess the
   corresponding risks in supplier selection. This paper proposes the
   supplier selection method that applies failures modes and effects
   analysis (FMEA) to assess the risks in the decision process. As each
   supplier is evaluated under the common multi-criteria framework, risks
   are viewed as the possible deviations from expected performance, and
   they are interpreted as failure modes in risk analysis. Following the
   concepts of FMEA, each failure mode is examined with respect to the
   possible causes and effects. This method generates two technical
   deliverables for supporting risk analysis. Firstly, the FMEA document is
   developed to support the team's discussion of supplier risks and
   accumulate the risk knowledge within the company. Secondly, the ranking
   numbers based on FMEA (i.e., risk priority numbers) are utilized to
   evaluate a discount on a supplier's performance according to their risk
   level. A real-case example about selecting methanol suppliers in the
   global market is used to demonstrate the proposed method for risk
   analysis in practice.}},

Abstract = {{Human skin-derived precursor cells (hSKPs) are multipotent adult stem
   cells found in the dermis of human skin. Incorporation of hSKPs into
   split-thickness skin grafts (STSGs), the current gold standard to treat
   severe burns or tissue resections, has been proposed as a treatment
   option to enhance skin wound healing and tissue function. For this
   approach to be clinically viable substantial quantities of hSKPs are
   required, which is the rate-limiting step, as only a few thousand hSKPs
   can be isolated from an autologous skin biopsy without causing donor
   site morbidity. In order to produce sufficient quantities of clinically
   viable cells, we have developed a bioprocess capable of expanding hSKPs
   as aggregates in stirred suspension bioreactors (SSBs). In this study,
   we found hSKPs from adult donors to expand significantly more (P<0.05)
   at 60rpm in SSBs than in static cultures. Furthermore, the utility of
   the SSBs, at 60rpm is demonstrated by serial passaging of hSKPs from a
   small starting population, which can be isolated from an autologous skin
   biopsy without causing donor site morbidity. At 60rpm, aggregates were
   markedly smaller and did not experience oxygen diffusional limitations,
   as seen in hSKPs cultured at 40rpm. While hSKPs also grew at 80rpm
   (0.74Pa) and 100rpm (1Pa), they produced smaller aggregates due to high
   shear stress. The pH of the media in all the SSBs was closer to
   biological conditions and significantly different (P<0.05) from static
   cultures, which recorded acidic pH conditions. The nutrient
   concentrations of the media in all the SSBs and static cultures did not
   drop below acceptable limits. Furthermore, there was no significant
   build-up of waste products to limit hSKP expansion in the SSBs. In
   addition, hSKP markers were maintained in the 60rpm SSB as demonstrated
   by immunocytochemistry. This method of growing hSKPs in a batch culture
   at 60rpm in a SSB represents an important first step in developing an
   automated bioprocess to produce substantial numbers of clinically viable
   hSKPs aimed at regenerating the dermis to improve healing of severe skin

Abstract = {{Several emerging improved oil recovery (IOR) techniques have been
   proposed in the past decades with promising results. However, a
   systematic study of reservoir heterogeneity on these advanced processes
   has not yet been presented. This paper provides one of the first
   comparative evaluations of the effects of reservoir heterogeneity on
   various IOR processes from the conventional methods (waterflooding, CO2
   flooding) to the emerging recovery technologies (Low-Salinity
   Waterflooding and CO2 Low-Salinity WAG) for wider and more successful
   implementation of these projects. Since weakness exists in the current
   simple and unrealistic models, detailed geostatistic models are employed
   to provide a more realistic and unbiased evaluation of reservoir
   heterogeneity. A new modeling approach that involves the integration of
   geological software, a reservoir simulator and a robust optimizer in a
   closed loop for generating multiple geologically driven realizations and
   uncertainty assessment of different recovery processes is introduced.
   Then a series of numerical simulations is conducted to investigate the
   influences of FU and CU sequences on oil recovery. Finally, the
   uncertainty range of reservoir heterogeneity is thoroughly evaluated
   using a large number of geological realizations with significant
   differences on porosity and permeability distributions. The effect of
   the K (v) /K (h) (aspect) ratio is also addressed in this study. The
   simulation results indicate that the depositional sequence has a
   dominant effect on oil recovery in all recovery processes. The CU
   distribution demonstrates superior performance over the FU distribution.}},

Abstract = {{The collocated Lebedev grid has previously been proposed as an
   alternative to the Yee grid for electromagnetic finite-difference
   time-domain (FDTD) simulations. While it performs better in anisotropic
   media, it performs poorly in isotropic media because it is equivalent to
   four overlapping, uncoupled Yee grids. We propose to couple the four Yee
   grids and fix the Lebedev method using discrete exterior calculus (DEC)
   with higher-order Hodge duals. We find that higher-order Hodge duals do
   improve the performance of the Lebedev grid, but they also improve the
   Yee grid by a similar amount. The effectiveness of coupling overlapping
   Yee grids with a higher-order Hodge dual is thus questionable. However,
   the theoretical foundations developed to derive these methods may be of
   interest in other problems. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a hybrid method, which consists of a
   mixed-hybrid finite element method and a penalty discontinuous Galerkin
   method, for the approximation of a fractional flow formulation of a
   two-phase flow problem in heterogeneous media with discontinuous
   capillary pressure. The fractional flow formulation is comprised of a
   wetting phase pressure equation and a wetting phase saturation equation
   which are coupled through a total velocity. and the saturation affected
   coefficients. For the wetting phase pressure equation, the continuous
   mixed-hybrid finite element method space can be utilized due to a
   fundamental property that the wetting phase pressure is continuous.
   While it can reduce the computational cost by using less degrees of
   freedom arid avoiding the post-processing of velocity reconstruction,
   this method can also keep several good properties of the discontinuous
   Galerkin method, which are important to the fractional flow formulation,
   such as the local mass balance, continuous normal flux and capability of
   handling the discontinuous capillary pressure. For the wetting phase
   saturation equation, the penalty discontinuous Galerkin method is
   utilized due to its capability of handling the discontinuous jump of the
   wetting phase saturation. Furthermore, an adaptive algorithm for the
   hybrid method together with the centroidal Voronoi-Delaunay
   triangulation technique is proposed. Five numerical examples are
   presented to illustrate the features of proposed numerical method, such
   as the optimal convergence order, the accurate and efficient velocity
   approximation, and the applicability to the simulation of water flooding
   in oil field and the oil-trapping or barrier effect phenomena. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In recent years, hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling have been
   applied to extract crude oil from tight reservoirs, including the Bakken
   formation. There is growing interest in understanding the greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions associated with the development of tight oil. We
   conducted a life cycle assessment of Bakken crude using data from
   operations throughout the supply chain, including drilling and
   completion, refining, and use of refined products. If associated gas is
   gathered throughout the Bakken well life cycle, then the well to wheel
   GHG emissions are estimated to be 89 g CO(2)eq/MJ (80\% CI, 87-94) of
   Bakken-derived gasoline and 90 g CO(2)eq/MJ (80\% CI, 88-94) of diesel.
   If associated gas is flared for the first 12 mo of production, then life
   cycleGHGemissions increase by 5\% on average. Regardless of the level of
   flaring, the Bakken life cycle GHG emissions are comparable to those of
   other crudes refined in the United States because flaring GHG emissions
   are largely offset at the refinery due to the physical properties of
   this tight oil. We also assessed the life cycle freshwater consumptions
   of Bakken-derived gasoline and diesel to be 1.14 (80\% CI, 0.67-2.15)
   and 1.22 barrel/barrel (80\% CI, 0.71-2.29), respectively, 13\% of which

Abstract = {{A recent approach to colon cancer therapy is to employ selective drugs
   with specific extra/intracellular sites of action. Alteration of
   cytoskeletal protein reorganization and, subsequently, to cellular
   biomechanical behaviour during cancer progression highly affects the
   cancer cell progress. Hence, cytoskeleton targeted drugs are an
   important class of cancer therapy agents. We have studied viscoelastic
   alteration of the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, SW48, after
   treatment with a drug delivery system comprising chitosan as the carrier
   and albendazole as the microtubule-targeting agent (MTA). For the first
   time, we have evaluated the biomechanical characteristics of the cell
   line, using the micropipette aspiration (MA) method after treatment with
   drug delivery systems. Surprisingly, employing a chitosan-albendazole
   pair, in comparison with both neat materials, resulted in more
   significant change in the viscoelastic parameters of cells, including
   the elastic constants (K-1 and K-2) and the coefficient of viscosity
   (mu). This difference was more pronounced for cancer cells after 48 h of
   the treatment. Microtubule and actin microfilament (F-actin) contents in
   the cell line were studied by immunofluorescent staining. Good agreement
   was observed between the mechanical characteristics results and
   microtubule/F-actin contents of the treated SW48 cell line, which
   declined after treatment. The results showed that chitosan affected
   F-actin more, while MTA was more effective for microtubules. Toxicity
   studies were performed against two cancer cell lines (SW48 and
   MCF10CA1h) and compared to normal cells, MCF10A. The results showed
   cancer selectiveness, safety of formulation, and enhanced anticancer
   efficacy of the CS/ABZ conjugate. This study suggests that employing
   such a suitable pair of drug-carriers with dissimilar sites of action,
   thus allying the different cell cytoskeleton disrupting mechanisms, may
   provide a more efficient cancer therapy approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{A fully discrete second-order decoupled implicit/explicit method is
   proposed for solving 3D primitive equations of ocean in the case of
   Dirichlet boundary conditions on the side, where a second-order
   decoupled implicit/explicit scheme is used for time discretization, and
   a finite element method based on the P-1 (P-1) - P-1 - P-1 (P-1)
   elements for velocity, pressure and density is used for spatial
   discretization of these primitive equations. Optimal H-1 - L-2 - H-1
   error estimates for numerical solution (u(h)(n), p(h)(n), theta(n)(h))
   and an optimal L-2 error estimate for (u(h)(n), theta(n)(h)) are
   established under the convergence condition of 0 < h <= beta(1), 0 < tau
   <= beta(2), and tau <= beta(3)h for some positive constants beta(1),
   beta(2), and beta(3). Furthermore, numerical computations show that the
   H-1 - L-2 - H-1 convergence rate for numerical solution (u(h)(n),
   p(h)(n), theta(n)(h)) is of O (h + tau(2)) and an L-2 convergence rate
   for (u(h)(n), theta(n)(h)) is O (h(2) + tau(2)) with the assumed
   convergence condition, where h is a mesh size and tau is a time step
   size. More practical calculations are performed as a further validation

Abstract = {{Steam fracturing as done during cyclic steam stimulation is an effective
   thermal process for initiating recovery from viscous oil reservoirs such
   as oil sands reservoirs found in Alberta, Canada and Liaohe, China. A
   key component of these processes is the ability to inject high
   temperature steam into the formation to fracture it which in turn raises
   its permeability and mobilizes the oil by lowering its viscosity. The
   dynamics of steam fracturing are not fully resolved especially how steam
   fingers into the reservoir and how its state changes as heat losses
   occur from the injected steam. The results of this study reveal that
   steam condensate, pressurized by the steam vapour upstream, fractures
   the formation. The results also show that dilation of the reservoir
   during steam injection relieves the pressure which in turn lowers the
   steam injection pressure below that of the case where no dilation
   occurs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The eighteenth century Prince of Wales Fort in Manitoba Canada has
   experienced extensive freeze-thaw damage and mortar washout within the

   Injection of grout could counteract this degradation of structural
   stability. However existing literature provides little guidance as to
   the improvement level that could be expected, especially with respect to
   out-of-plane performance. As such, the proposed treatment was modelled
   to include a high level of uncertainty in the system through the
   application of a Random Field Finite Element Micro modelling technique.
   A Latin Hyper cube simulation method was used in conjunction with a
   parametric finite element model to randomize the material properties of
   each stone and relevant grouting layers. The numerical results predicted
   that the stone-grout bond was the most critical parameter in the
   proposed intervention, and that in the grouted wall sections, collapse
   would be avoided and lateral displacements stabilized with the proposed

Abstract = {{A novel spouted bed reactor is evaluated for water treatment by an
   adsorption and electrochemical regeneration process. The adsorbent is a
   bisulphate graphite intercalation compound with low specific surface
   area but high electrical conductivity, suitable for adsorption of
   contaminants and simultaneous electrochemical regeneration within a
   single unit. The effects of current density and liquid flow rate on Acid
   Violet 17 removal were investigated. The hydrodynamic behaviour of the
   liquid spouted bed reactor was characterised by a flow regime map. A
   four-parameter model has been developed to describe the adsorption and
   electrochemical regeneration process in the liquid spouted bed reactor.
   It was found that the experimental data of dye removal agrees well with
   the modelled simulations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{It is essential to predict the nature of instability for incorporating
   viscous instability in modeling surfactant waterflooding of heavy oils.
   A two-dimensional low-permeability sandstone micromodel in a nonlinear
   quarter five-spot scheme is used for the visualization and analysis of
   viscous fingering in alcohol-assisted surfactant waterflooding of heavy
   oil. Three distinct regimes of viscous fingering are discovered and
   proposed. The results also suggest that it is the viscous crossflow that
   causes the fingers growth beyond the onset of viscous fingering.
   Moreover, in low-interfacial tension drainage conducted in this study,
   the frontal drive occurs with cluster growth and entailing microfingers
   that sometimes fill the entire pore body. Numerous features regarding
   the fingers population, onset and mechanisms of viscous fingering, and
   fingers development and propagation are discovered and analyzed. A
   comprehensive comparison is made between the viscous fingering features
   of this study and those of literature. This study provides new insights
   into the population of fingers, onset and mechanisms of viscous
   fingering, and fingers development and propagation in alcohol-assisted
   surfactant waterflooding of heavy oils. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Aerobic granules, a relative novel form of microbial aggregate, are
   capable of degrading many toxic organic pollutants. Appropriate strategy
   is needed to acclimate seed sludge to the toxic compounds for successful
   granulation. In this study, two distinct strategies, i.e. mixed or
   single carbon sources, were experimented to obtain phenol-acclimated
   sludge. Their effects on reactor performance, biomass characteristics,
   microbial population and the granulation process were analyzed. Sludge
   fed with phenol alone exhibited faster acclimation and earlier
   appearance of granules, but possibly lower microbial diversity and
   reactor stability. Using a mixture of acetate and phenol in the
   acclimation stage, on the other hand, led to a reactor with slower
   phenol degradation and granulation, but eventual formation of strong and
   stable aerobic granules. In addition, the content of intracellular
   polyhydoxyakanoates (PHA) was also monitored, and significant
   accumulation was observed during the pre-granulation stage, where PHA
   >50\% of dry weight was observed in both reactors. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{Effects of Lateral and Medial Wedged Insoles on Knee and Ankle Internal
   Joint Moments During Walking in Healthy Men}},

Volume = {{106}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Wedged insoles have been used to treat knee pathologies and
   to prevent injuries. Although they have received much attention for the
   study of knee injury, the effects of wedges on ankle joint biomechanics
   are not well understood. This study sought to evaluate the immediate
   effects of lateral and medial wedges on knee and ankle internal joint
   loading and center of pressure (CoP) in men during walking.
   Methods: Twenty-one healthy men walked at 1.4 m/sec in five footwear
   conditions: neutral, 6 degrees (LW6) and 9 degrees (LW9) lateral wedges,
   and 6 degrees (MW6) and 9 degrees (MW9) medial wedges. Peak internal
   knee abduction moments and angular impulses, internal ankle inversion
   moments and angular impulses, and mediolateral CoP were analyzed.
   Analysis of variance with post hoc analysis and Pearson correlations
   were performed to detect differences between conditions.
   Results: No differences in internal knee joint loading were found
   between neutral and any of the wedge conditions. However, as the wedge
   angle increased from medial to lateral, the internal ankle inversion
   moment (LW6: P=.020; LW9: P<.001; MW6: P=.046; MW9: P<.001) and angular
   impulse (LW9: P=.012) increased, and the CoP shifted laterally (LW9:
   P<.001) and medially (MW9: P<.001) compared with the neutral condition.
   Conclusions: Neither lateral nor medial wedges were effective in
   altering internal knee joint loading during walking. However, the
   greater internal ankle inversion moment and angular impulse observed
   with lateral wedges could lead to a higher risk of ankle injury. Thus,
   caution should be taken when lateral wedges need to be prescribed.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, low-permeability (tight) gas condensate and oil reservoirs
   have been the focus of exploitation by operators in North America.
   Multifractured horizontal wells (MFHWs) producing from these reservoirs
   commonly exhibit long periods of transient flow, during which two-phase
   flow of oil and gas begins because of well flowing pressures dropping to
   less than saturation pressure. History matching and forecasting of such
   wells can be rigorously performed by use of numerical simulation, but
   this approach requires significant data and time to set up. Analytical
   methods, although requiring fewer data and less time to apply, have
   historically been developed only for single-phase-flow scenarios. In
   this work, a novel and rigorous analytical method is developed for
   history matching and forecasting MFHWs experiencing multiphase flow
   during the transient and boundarydominated flow periods.
   The distance-of-investigation (DOI) concept has been used for many years
   in pressure-transient analysis to estimate distances of reservoir
   boundaries to wells, among other applications. In the current work, the
   DOI concept is used to estimate dynamic drainage area (DDA) to forecast
   tight gas condensate and oil wells; a linear flow geometry is assumed.
   During transient flow, the DDA is calculated at each timestep by use of
   the linear-flow DOI formulation; a multiphase version of the linear-flow
   productivityindex (PI) equation and material-balance equations for gas,
   condensate, and oil are solved iteratively for pressure, saturation, and
   fluid-production rate. The PI equations for gas and oil use
   pseudopressure, which is evaluated with saturation/pressure
   relationships derived from pressure/volume/temperature data. For
   boundarydominated flow, when the drainage area is static, the inflow
   equations are again coupled with material balance for both phases.
   The new method is validated against numerical simulation, covering a
   wide range of fluid properties and operating conditions. The new method
   matches the simulation acceptably for all cases studied. Field examples
   of MFHWs are also analyzed to demonstrate the practical applicability of
   the approach. The three liquid-rich shale examples analyzed were also
   chosen to represent a wide range of fluid properties. In all cases,
   acceptable history matches are achieved.
   The new analytical forecasting/history-matching procedure developed in
   this work provides a practical alternative to numerical simulation for
   tight gas condensate and oil experiencing twophase flow during the
   transient-flow period. The method, which does not rely on Laplace-space
   solutions, is conceptually simple to understand, easy to implement, and
   avoids the inconvenience of Laplace-space inversion.}},

   other producers set their supply functions, 2) the wind power producer
   sets its supply function and so do other producers, and 3) the wind
   power producer teams up with a non-wind generating firm and the
   aggregated firm sets its supply function and so do other producers.
   Supply function equilibrium models are used to determine the strategic

Abstract = {{Hydraulic fracturing is an effective technology to improve shale gas
   wells production. The key problem in shale gas well hydraulic fracturing
   is opening hydraulic fractures to connect natural fractures and weak
   planes, in turn, creates the fracture network. The shear failure of
   matrix, natural fracture and weak plane are the main rock rupture models
   used in shale gas reservoirs. In this paper, firstly, a bottom hole
   pressure calculation model is built to show that large hole perforations
   and big pipeline diameters should be used to decrease perforation
   friction. Secondly, shale rock, natural fracture and weak plane shear
   failure models, based on rock mechanics theory, are presented. The
   calculated results show that horizontal. differential principal stress
   has a significant influence on shear failure and the slippage of natural
   fracture and weak plane. A higher value of differential principal stress
   indicates a lower shale rock shear failure pressure, which brings
   benefits to weak plane slippage. Elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio all
   have effects on weak plane shear slippage. The influences of elastic
   modulus on shear slippage have a greater impact than Poisson's ratio. A
   reasonable dip angle of weak plane is also provided to enhance weak
   plane slippage. The practical-approach built in the paper does not
   require more rock mechanics parameters. The results have potential to
   enrich shale rock shear rupture theory and benefit fracture mesh system
   research. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Gas production from low permeability ('tight') and shale formations has
   become a major source of hydrocarbon supply in North America over the
   past two decades. This shift in supply from conventional to
   unconventional sources was enabled by the combi nation of hydraulic
   fracturing and horizontal wells which allowed production rates to reach
   economically viable levels. Thus, the design and implementation of
   hydraulic fracturing ('HF') treatments occupies a central role in
   reservoir management of unconventional plays. A primary goal of an HF
   treatment is to create a high-conductivity fracture or fractures with
   sufficient reservoir contact. However, efforts must be undertaken to
   monitor and evaluate the extent of HF growth into the target reservoir
   and bounding horizons for the purposes of not only optimizing the
   treatment, but also for mitigating the risk of groundwater
   contamination.
   In this work, it is demonstrated for the first time that fracture height
   growth in layered geologic systems with variable and distinct fluid
   compositions by layer maybe assessed. For this purpose, an analytical
   model was developed to predict the degree of fracture penetration of a
   hydraulic fracture in a 2-layer tight/shale reservoir. The model uses
   gas production rates and compositions during flowback to assess height
   growth, assuming that layer-specific gas compositions are accurately
   known. These layer fluid compositions may be assessed using mudgas and
   gas samples extracted from the headspace of isojars containing collected
   cuttings samples during drilling. The theoretical development of the new
   analytical model is described in this work, and its accuracy determined
   through datasets generated with a numerical simulator. The practical
   application of this new model to an actual field dataset will be
   provided in Part 2.
   The importance of this study is that it provides a practical and
   independent method for establishing what portions of a layered system
   that the HF is in hydraulic communication with, which is not provided
   with other surveillance methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{While hydraulic fracturing is the key to unlocking the potential of
   unconventional low-permeability hydrocarbon resources, challenges remain
   in the monitoring of subsurface propagation of fractures and the
   determination of which geologic intervals have been contacted. This is
   particularly challenging for wells that are completed in multiple
   hydraulic fracture stages (multi-fractured horizontal wells or MFHWs)
   where fracture spacing may be very close and fracture geometry complex.
   Understanding the fracture extent is important not only for assisting
   with hydraulic fracture design, but also for mitigating unwanted
   fracture growth into non-target geologic intervals that do not contain
   hydrocarbons (e.g. zones with high water saturation). Popular current
   technologies used for hydraulic fracture surveillance include
   microseismic (surface and subsurface monitoring) and tiltmeter surveys.
   While these methods have proven useful for characterizing the extent of
   created hydraulic fractures, they do not necessarily lead to an
   understanding of what portions of the geologic section (bounding and
   target intervals for MFHWs, for example) are in direct hydraulic
   communication with the well.
   A solution for establishing the extent of hydraulic fracture growth from
   target to bounding zones is to first obtain a fluid composition
   fingerprint of those intervals while drilling through them, and then
   compare these data with fluid compositions obtained from flowback after
   hydraulic fracturing. In the current work, a MFHW completed in a
   liquid-rich tight reservoir is used to test this novel concept. Gas
   samples extracted from the headspace of isojarse (R) containing cuttings
   samples, obtained during drilling of the MFHW well, were used to
   geochemically fingerprint geologic intervals through which the well was
   drilled. The cuttings samples were collected at high frequency in the
   vertical, bend and lateral sections of the well over a measured depth
   range of 4725 ft (1440 m). A compositional marker was identified in the
   bend of the horizontal well above which the average methane to ethane
   (C-1/C-2) ratio was 15.7, versus 2.6 below it. The flowback gas
   compositions were observed to be intermediate (average C-1/C-2 = 7.4)
   between the reservoir above and below the marker, suggesting fracture
   height grew above the compositional marker.
   In order to estimate fracture height growth from the geologic interval
   and flowback compositions, a compositional numerical simulation study
   was performed. An innovative approach was used to estimate recombined
   in-situ fluid compositions, on a layer-by-layer basis, by combining the
   cuttings gas compositional data with separator oil compositions. The
   resulting numerical simulation model, initialized through use of the
   layered fluid model and a detailed geological model developed for the
   subject well and offset drilling locations, was used to history match
   flowback rates, pressures and gas compositions. The gas compositions of
   the fingerprinted geologic intervals were therefore employed as a
   constraint on fracture height growth, estimated in the model to be 175
   ft (53 m, propped height). However, because of the uncertainty in model
   input parameters, a stochastic approach was required to derive a range
   in hydraulic fracture properties.
   The current study demonstrates for the first time that it is possible to
   constrain fracture height growth estimates from flowback data, combined
   with gas compositional data obtained from cuttings data, provided that
   the geochemical fingerprints are distinct. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Calcium (Ca) based sorbents utilized in the carbon dioxide (CO2) capture
   process at high temperatures have displayed considerable activity loss
   during extended use, due to sintering. Refractory zirconium-based
   ceramics, however, have shown excellent performances as thermal barrier
   coatings in many high-tech applications; and, the recent doping of
   zirconia in Ca-based sorbents has exhibited excellent sustainability in
   the activity stability in cyclic CO2 capture operations. In this work,
   we doped sorbents, at loadings of 10 wt\%, with a few zirconium-based
   ceramics, such as alkaline earth metal zirconate (calcium zirconate,
   CaZrO3), which has the chemical structure of perovskite, and rare earth
   metal zirconates, which have the chemical structure of pyrochlore. These
   materials were prepared through the wet co-precipitation method, in
   order to achieve the optimal uptake capacity and stability in cyclic CO2
   capture operations. Among the sorbents tested, the CaZrO3-doped sorbents
   exhibited excellent performance, remarkable thermal stability and
   sintering resistant. Therefore, the sorbents were stable though 30
   carbonation calcination cycles. The sorbent showed a CO2 capture
   capacity of 12 mol CO2/kg sorbent, with an activity loss of 19.6\%
   through carbonation at 675 degrees C for 10 min and calcination at 850
   degrees C for 10 min. Among the rare earth metal zirconate ceramics,
   samarium zirconate (Sm2Zr2O7) exhibited the best stability with an
   activity loss of 23.4\% loss, but at a lower uptake of 7.2 mol CO2/kg
   sorbent at the same carbonation calcination conditions. In comparison,
   Cadomin (a natural calcium carbonate) at the same conditions resulted in
   a capture capacity of 13.5 mol CO2/kg sorbent and an activity loss of
   69\%. Surface area characterizations showed that incorporation of the
   ceramics to the calcium based sorbents significantly improved the
   surface morphology and textural properties of the sorbents. X-ray
   diffraction results indicated that the improved resistance of the
   sorbent could be due to forming of ceramic structures such
   perovskite-type CaZrO3 at a relatively low temperature (around 850
   degrees C compared to higher temperatures required for pyrochlore-type
   ceramic formation), which made a stable sorbent structure for the
   carbonation process. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Millimetre Level Accuracy GNSS Positioning with the Blind Adaptive
   Beamforming Method in Interference Environments}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The use of antenna arrays in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)
   applications is gaining significant attention due to its superior
   capability to suppress both narrowband and wideband interference.
   However, the phase distortions resulting from array processing may limit
   the applicability of these methods for high precision applications using
   carrier phase based positioning techniques. This paper studies the phase
   distortions occurring with the adaptive blind beamforming method in
   which satellite angle of arrival (AoA) information is not employed in
   the optimization problem. To cater to non-stationary interference
   scenarios, the array weights of the adaptive beamformer are continuously
   updated. The effects of these continuous updates on the tracking
   parameters of a GNSS receiver are analyzed. The second part of this
   paper focuses on reducing the phase distortions during the blind
   beamforming process in order to allow the receiver to perform carrier
   phase based positioning by applying a constraint on the structure of the
   array configuration and by compensating the array uncertainties.
   Limitations of the previous methods are studied and a new method is
   proposed that keeps the simplicity of the blind beamformer structure
   and, at the same time, reduces tracking degradations while achieving
   millimetre level positioning accuracy in interference environments. To
   verify the applicability of the proposed method and analyze the
   degradations, array signals corresponding to the GPS Ll band are
   generated using a combination of hardware and software simulators.
   Furthermore, the amount of degradation and performance of the proposed
   method under different conditions are evaluated based on Monte Carlo
   simulations.}},

Title = {{Analysis of Multi-Antenna GNSS Receiver Performance under Jamming
   Attacks}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Although antenna array-based Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)
   receivers can be used to mitigate both narrowband and wideband
   electronic interference sources, measurement distortions induced by
   array processing methods are not suitable for high precision
   applications. The measurement distortions have an adverse effect on the
   carrier phase ambiguity resolution, affecting the navigation solution.
   Depending on the array attitude information availability and calibration
   parameters, different spatial processing methods can be implemented
   although they distort carrier phase measurements in some cases. This
   paper provides a detailed investigation of the effect of different array
   processing techniques on array-based GNSS receiver measurements and
   navigation performance. The main novelty of the paper is to provide a
   thorough analysis of array-based GNSS receivers employing different
   beamforming techniques from tracking to navigation solution. Two
   beamforming techniques, namely Power Minimization (PM) and Minimum Power
   Distortionless Response (MPDR), are being investigated. In the tracking
   domain, the carrier Doppler, Phase Lock Indicator (PLI), and
   Carrier-to-Noise Ratio (C/N-0) are analyzed. Pseudorange and carrier
   phase measurement distortions and carrier phase position performance are
   also evaluated. Performance analyses results from simulated GNSS signals
   and field tests are provided.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a series of core-shell structured spheriform CO2 sorbents
   were synthesized by using CaO-based pellets as cores and different
   mesoporous metal oxides (e.g. alumina, ceria, and yttrium-stabilized

   Cyclic CO2 capture performance of the obtained sorbents was investigated
   using a thermogravimetric analyzer. Among all the core/shell sorbents
   under study, the pellets coated with a layer of alumina exhibit the best
   performance in the retention of CO2 uptake over 20 cycles with the
   lowest activity loss of only 30.4\%, attributed to the existence of the
   thermal stable porous alumina shell which prevents the sintering and the
   aggregation of the CaO grains. Moreover, the attrition study using an
   air-jet apparatus and a standard test method reveals that such sorbents
   exhibit enhanced attrition resistance due to the protection of the
   porous shell providing them with a great potential for application in
   fluidized bed conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Flow displacements in homogeneous porous media can result in
   instabilities at the interface between the fluids. Such instabilities
   may dramatically affect the overall efficiency of the displacement
   process and often need to be controlled. Flows that involve
   time-dependent injection schemes are analyzed to determine their effects
   on the growth of instabilities and the nonlinear development of finger
   structures in immiscible displacements. Predictions for monotonic and
   cyclic schemes in radial displacements are presented and compared with
   their constant injection counterpart. Moreover a controlled injection
   scheme that allows minimizing the instabilities is proposed. A hybrid
   model accounting for the discontinuities across the interface is
   implemented, and the problem is solved numerically. The effects of
   different parameters including the phase shift, amplitude, and period as
   well as the role of the mobility ratio and surface tension are
   discussed. A set of injection policies are observed to lead to the
   strongest attenuation of instabilities. Moreover, optimal phase shifts
   for cyclic displacements can result in the strongest enhancement or
   attenuation of the instability, depending on whether the flow involves
   extraction. A novel approach, referred to as the controlled injection
   scheme, has also been proposed and analyzed. In this scheme the flow is
   continuously adjusted in response to the growth rate of the
   instabilities resulting in a better capability of suppressing the
   development and growth of fingers.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the microscopic flow behaviour of hydrocarbons and water
   in porous media gains importance as more and more reservoirs are being
   exploited. Network modelling techniques could be extended to tighter
   media as long as Darcy's law is applicable. 3D random networks are
   constructed in order to represent the Mesaverde formation which is
   located in north Wyoming, USA. The network modelling software solves the
   fundamental equations of single-phase and two-phase immiscible flow
   incorporating wettability and contact angle assuming a quasi-static
   displacement mechanism. Macroscopic properties of the porous media
   network representation such as porosity, absolute permeability, and
   formation factor are calculated and whenever possible compared to
   experimental data. Subsequently, immiscible two-phase flow properties
   such as capillary pressure, relative permeability, and resistivity
   curves are predicted and compared to available experimental data. The
   effect of interfacial tension alteration is also investigated as an
   attempt to demonstrate the capability of the network modelling technique
   to show physical fluid behaviour. It is observed that the capillary
   pressure curve obtained using MICP data can be used to calibrate and
   validate the network model generated to represent the sample. The study
   shows that the modified random network modelling technique is capable of
   modelling low permeable porous medium and predicting single-phase and
   immiscible two-phase flow properties assuming quasi-static displacement
   mechanism.}},

Title = {{Water Sorption and Distribution Characteristics in Clay and Shale:
   Effect of Surface Force}},
Journal = {{ENERGY \& FUELS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{8863-8874}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Characteristics of sorption and distribution of water in nanoporous
   shale are topics of great interest to evaluate unconventional
   reservoirs. Also, a study of surface force of water/solid interaction at
   nanoscale is significant for understanding the storage of initial water
   and the fate of residual treatment liquid in shale systems. In this
   work, the thickness and stability of water film were investigated by
   vapor sorption experiments on clay and shale samples. Meanwhile, an
   approach based on surface forces (disjoining pressure), which resulted
   in the instability of adsorbed film transition into condensed bulk
   liquid, was developed to describe molecule/pore wall interactions. Our
   experimental results directly demonstrated the occurrence of capillary
   condensation in hydrophilic clay minerals; however, water would not
   entirely fill in shale nanopores even under high moisture conditions.
   This remarkable finding is mainly due to the inaccessibility of water
   molecules to micropores of hydrophobic organic matter. In addition, the
   water distribution characteristics are also significantly influenced by
   pore scale. Under a moist condition with certain relative humidity
   (e.g., RH = 0.98), the water distributed in hydrophilic inorganic pores
   with different sizes was mainly classified as (i) capillary water in
   small pores (e.g., <6-7 nm) and (ii) water film in large pores (e.g.,
   >6-7 nm). In contrast, the surface repulsion prevents water condensing
   and likely results in a monolayer water film sorption in hydrophobic
   organic pores (e.g., theta = 100 degrees). Therefore, in an actual shale
   system with initial moisture content, the inorganic microporosity
   totally blocked by water might be incapable of gas transport or storage,
   while the hydrophobic organic pores mainly provide effective space for
   gas accumulation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an augmented dual-band digital predistortion (DPD)
   technique for reducing the cross-band inter-modulation distortion (IMD)
   using predictive injection technique is proposed to address some of the
   shortcomings of dual-band DPDs. The technique alleviates the need to
   observe the cross-band third-order IMD (IMD3) terms in the feedback loop
   by predicting the distortion terms and generating synthetic signals,
   which are then injected at the transmitter side. To highlight the issue,
   the wideband and dual-band DPD architectures and their respective
   limitations are briefly outlined. The theory behind the proposed concept
   is developed, and practical measurements performed using a Class AB
   power amplifier driven by a long-term evolution signal are provided to
   support the theory. The results obtained show that the proposed method
   achieves promising performance in mitigating the cross-band IMD3 issue
   faced by dual-band DPDs. This technique can be extended to mitigate
   higher order cross-band distortion as well.}},

Abstract = {{A novel digital predistortion (DPD) with an ultralow feedback sampling
   rate is proposed for wideband wireless communications. Analytical
   groundwork is carried out to support the rationale of the proposed
   method. Due to the power amplifier (PA) spectral expansion, the sampling
   rate of the feedback loop in the DPD architecture generally requires
   several times the input signal bandwidth, which presents challenges for
   the analog-to-digital converter, especially in broadband applications.
   In order to remove this bottleneck in real-world implementation, a
   forward behavioral modeling method with low-rate aliasing PA output
   signals is adopted to estimate the model coefficients. The obtained
   coefficients are then used to predict the high-rate PA output, using the
   input signal with an adequate sampling rate, and to further generate the
   predistorter for the nonlinear PA with the conventional indirect
   learning architecture. To validate the proposed method, different PAs
   driven with a 40-MHz two-carrier Long Term Evolution are used for
   linearization purposes. Experimental results based on the instrument
   platform show that the proposed algorithm achieves almost equivalent
   results with only a 2.5 Msamples/s feedback sampling rate. Further
   experimental verification is also demonstrated on an FPGA platform,
   which achieves an adjacent channel power ratio that is better than -47
   dBc for 40-MHz signals with a feedback sampling rate of 20 Msamples/s.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel calibration algorithm based on real-valued
   time-delay neural network (RVTDNN) is proposed for the multiport
   receiver to recover I/Q signals from the received modulated signals,
   especially from wideband signals. All the system impairments, including
   the nonideal six-port correlator, the nonlinearity of the diodes, and
   the memory effects under the excitation of the wideband signals, are
   taken into consideration. The RVTDNN, which has three layers, consists
   of four inputs and two outputs (in-phase and quadrature signals), and
   its parameters (biases and weights) are all real-valued and are
   determined by the backpropagation algorithm. Finally, the proposed
   calibration method is validated by a 2-18-GHz six-port receiver under 3G
   and 4G signals. The performance of the error vector magnitude between
   the transmitted signals and received signals is always less than 1.8\%,
   which validates the correctness of the proposed model.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, corrosion of a X65 pipeline steel in CO2-saturated
   oil-free solutions and oil-water emulsions was investigated using a
   home-made pipe flow system by various electrochemical measurements and
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. It is found that, in both
   oil-free solutions and oil-water emulsions, the mass-transfer of
   corrosive species, such as H+ and H2CO3, dominates the cathodic process
   during corrosion of the steel. With the increase of the flow velocity,
   the mass transfer is accelerated, contributing to increased corrosion.
   The presence of oil in the fluid decreases the steel corrosion, and the
   effect is amplified with the increasing oil content. This is attributed
   to the increased opportunity that the pipe wall becomes oil-wetting when
   the fluid contains more oil. The CFD simulation and the parameter
   derivation, combined with a semi-empirical model, are able to predict
   the corrosion rate of steels in CO2-saturated oil-water emulsion flow.

   contrary to the original thought informed inclusion of an impurity such
   as H2S has a potential to accelerate the onset of buoyancy-driven
   instabilities and possibly leading to more effective solubility
   trapping. This result improves our understanding of the storage of

Abstract = {{Surgical training is evolving from an observership model towards a new
   paradigm that includes virtual reality (VR) simulation. In
   otolaryngology, temporal bone dissection has become intimately linked
   with VR simulation as the complexity of anatomy demands a high level of
   surgeon aptitude and confidence. While an adequate 3D visualization of
   the surgical site is available in current simulators, the force feedback
   rendered during haptic interaction does not convey vibrations. This lack
   of vibration rendering limits the simulation fidelity of a surgical
   drill such as that used in temporal bone dissection. In order to develop
   an immersive simulation platform capable of haptic force and vibration
   feedback, the efficacy of hand controllers for rendering vibration in
   different drilling circumstances needs to be investigated. In this
   study, the vibration rendering ability of four different haptic hand
   controllers were analyzed and compared to find the best commercial
   haptic hand controller. A test-rig was developed to record vibrations
   encountered during temporal bone dissection and a software was written
   to render the recorded signals without adding hardware to the system. An
   accelerometer mounted on the end-effector of each device recorded the
   rendered vibration signals. The newly recorded vibration signal was
   compared with the input signal in both time and frequency domains by
   coherence and cross correlation analyses to quantitatively measure the
   fidelity of these devices in terms of rendering vibrotactile drilling
   feedback in different drilling conditions. This method can be used to
   assess the vibration rendering ability in VR simulation systems and
   selection of ideal haptic devices. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Numerical simulations of solid particles seeded into a supersonic flow
   containing an oblique shock wave reflection were performed. The momentum
   transfer mechanism between solid and gas phases in the
   shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction was studied by varying the
   particle size and mass loading. It was discovered that solid particles
   were capable of significant modulation of the flow field, including
   suppression of flow separation. The particle size controlled the rate of
   momentum transfer while the particle mass loading controlled the
   magnitude of momentum transfer. The seeding of micro- and nano-sized
   particles upstream of a supersonic/hypersonic air-breathing propulsion
   system is proposed as a flow control concept. (C) 2016 IAA. Published by

Abstract = {{The study of gait biomechanics in individuals with knee osteoarthritis
   has become widespread, especially in regards to the knee adduction
   moment-a variable commonly believed to be associated with knee
   osteoarthritis progression. Unfortunately, this variable is often
   studied clinically without considering how it is derived, or what it
   means in a mechanical context. The use of footwear for knee
   osteoarthritis management has received much attention as well. However,
   in many cases, footwear is studied without regard for the mechanical
   effects they actually induce on the patient. Therefore, this review aims
   to summarize the current state of knowledge in regards to knee
   osteoarthritis gait and footwear biomechanics, by taking a step back to
   review the foundations of these two research areas. First, an overview
   of the calculation of the knee adduction moment is provided, along with
   mechanical considerations. Then, this is used to discuss current
   evidence for wedged insoles and highlight knowledge gaps. The intent was
   to place this mechanical information in a clinically-oriented framework
   for approachability by scientists, engineers and clinicians alike. Based
   on this discussion, areas for future investigation are proposed.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a fixed bed flow through UVA-LED photoreactor was used to
   compare the efficiency of ozone, photocatalysis and photocatalysis-ozone
   degradation, and mineralization of two pure pesticides,
   2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and
   2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA), and a commercial one,
   KillexA (R). For the degradation of the parent compounds, ozone-based
   processes were more effective. While for mineralization, photocatalytic
   processes were more effective. Photocatalytic ozonation was the most
   efficient process for both the degradation and mineralization of the
   parent compounds. The degradation rates and mineralization by
   photocatalytic ozonation were higher than the summation of the
   corresponding rates by ozonation and photocatalysis, indicating a
   symbiotic relationship.
   Overall, the photocatalytic ozonation process with the fixed bed TiO2
   reduces the time needed for the degradation and mineralization of the
   pesticides, reduces the costs of powder catalyst separation and
   overcomes the reduced efficiency of immobilized catalysts, which makes
   the process quite attractive for practical applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the local corrosion at crack tip on an API 5L X46 pipeline
   steel specimens was investigated under various applied loads in a

   potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy,
   combined with micro-electrochemical technique and surface
   characterization, were conducted to investigate the effect of stress on
   local anodic solution of the steel at the crack tip. The stress
   corrosion cracking of the steel was dominated by an anodic dissolution
   mechanism, while the effect of hydrogen was negligible. The applied load
   (stress) increased the corrosion rate at the crack tip, contributing to
   crack propagation. The deposit of corrosion products at the crack tip
   could protect somewhat from further corrosion. At sufficiently large
   applied loads such as 740 N in the work, it was possible to generate
   separated cathode and anode, further accelerating the crack growth.}},

Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Shock wave formation and acceleration in a high-aspect ratio cross
   section shock tube were studied experimentally and numerically. The
   relative importance of geometric effects and diaphragm opening time on
   shock formation are assessed. The diaphragm opening time was controlled
   through the use of slit-type (fast opening time) and petal-type (slow
   opening time) diaphragms. A novel method of fabricating the petal-type
   diaphragms, which results in a consistent burst pressure and symmetric
   opening without fragmentation, is presented. High-speed schlieren
   photography was used to visualize the unsteady propagation of the lead
   shock wave and trailing gas dynamic structures. Surface-mounted pressure
   sensors were used to capture the spatial and temporal development of the
   pressure field. Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes simulation
   predictions using the shear-stress-transport turbulence model are
   compared to the experimental data. Simulation results are used to
   explain the presence of high-frequency pressure oscillations observed
   experimentally in the driver section as well as the cause of the initial
   acceleration and subsequent rapid decay of shock velocity measured along
   the top and bottom channel surfaces. A one-dimensional theoretical model
   predicting the effect of the finite opening time of the diaphragm on the
   rate of driver depressurization and shock acceleration is proposed. The
   model removes the large amount of empiricism that accompanies existing
   models published in the literature. Model accuracy is assessed through
   comparisons with experiments and simulations. Limitations of and
   potential improvements in the model are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To explore phase contrast (PC) magnetic resonance imaging of
   aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations (AVM). PC imaging obtains a
   vector field of the velocity and can yield additional hemodynamic
   information, including: volume flow rate (VFR) and intravascular
   pressure. We expect to find lower VFR distal to aneurysms and higher VFR
   in vessels of the AVM.
   Materials and Methods: Five cerebral aneurysm and three AVM patients
   were imaged with PC techniques and compared to VFR of a healthy cohort.
   VFR was calculated in vessel segments in each patient and compared
   statistically to the healthy cohort by computing the z-score.
   Intravascular pressure was calculated in the aneurysms and in the nidus
   of each AVM.
   Results: We found that patients with aneurysm had z < -0.48 in vessels
   distal to the aneurysm (reduced flow), while AVM patients had z > 6 in
   some vessels supplying and draining the nidus (increased flow).
   Pressures in aneurysms were highly variable between subjects and
   location, while in the nidus of the AVM patients; pressure trended
   higher in larger AVMs.
   Conclusion: The study findings confirm the expectation of lower distal
   flow in aneurysm and higher arterial and venous flow in AVM patients.

Abstract = {{Unlike two-class (multi-class) support vector machines, massive targets
   and few outliers are available in one-class support vector machine. The
   strategies to select useful data for two-class (multi-class) support
   vector machines are not suitable for one-class support vector machine.
   In this paper, relative density degree is introduced to select useful
   data for one-class support vector machine. These data would become
   support vectors after training and locate near the boundary of the data
   distribution. The relative density degree of the data near the boundary
   of the training set is smaller than that of the data in the interior of
   the training set. Thus, the data near the boundary of training set can
   be preserved and the others can be disposed through relative density
   degree. Experimental results show that merely preserving about 20 \% of
   the training set, the performance will not decrease and be better than
   previous related method. But the model is simpler and the training
   process is faster.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, PEGylated D-amino acid K122-4 peptide (D-K122-4-PEG),
   derived from the type IV pilin of Pseudo-monas aeruginosa, coated on 304
   stainless steel was investigated for its corrosion resistant properties
   in a sodium chloride solution by various electrochemical measurements,
   surface characterization and molecular dynamics simulation. As a
   comparison, stainless steel electrodes coated with non-PEGylated D-amino
   acid retroinverso peptide (RI-K122-4) and D-amino acid K122-4 peptide
   (D-K122-4) were used as control variables during electrochemical tests.
   It was found that the D-K122-4-PEG coating is able to protect the
   stainless steel from corrosion in the solution. The RI-K122-4 coating
   shows corrosion resistant property and should be investigated further,
   while the D-K122-4 peptide coating, in contrast, shows little to no
   effect on corrosion. The morphological characterizations support the
   corrosion resistance of D-K122-4-PEG on stainless steel. The adsorption
   of D-K122-4 molecules occurs preferentially on Fe2O3, rather than Cr2O3,
   present on the stainless steel surface. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Bitumen upgrading involves the hydroconversion of larger molecules that
   require catalyst supports with meso- and/or macropores for access to the
   active sites. In this study, various activation processes were studied
   to activate delayed petroleum coke, which is a by-product of oil sands
   bitumen upgrading and an inexpensive source of carbon. The petroleum
   coke was subjected to steam, chemical (KOH, NaOH) and combined
   activation methods at 973 K and 1073 K. The produced materials were
   characterized with nitrogen physisorption at 77 K and scanning electron
   microscopy. Combined with the yields, the results suggested that the
   combination of steam with sodium or potassium increased the mesoporosity
   of the carbon samples possibly by a catalytic gasification mechanism. A
   mesopore volume of 0.39 cm(3)/g with a yield of 27\% was achieved by
   simultaneously activating with sodium and steam. Washing the material
   after activation with sodium and before introducing steam produced the
   same mesoporosity but doubled the yield, confirming that steam alone is
   not effective at creating porosity. The accessibility of the larger
   pores was confirmed with the adsorption of asphaltenes from Athabasca
   extra-heavy crude oil. The capacity for asphaltene adsorption increased
   with increasing mesopore volume. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The nanoparticles in fluid enhance the rate of heat transfer because of
   higher thermal conductivity of nanoparticles. In literature, researchers
   have used different numerical methods to simulate this phenomenon
   considering the fluid as a single phase or as a two phase system. In
   some cases, the numerical results were compared with experimental
   results and good agreements were achieved; while for other no comparison
   was done. On the other hand, there,is no identical numerical research
   that compares various numerical approaches that can be used to study
   thermo-fluidic flow in nanofluid. Accordingly, in this study we have
   numerically solved a benchmark heat transfer nanofluid problem using
   three different widely used numerical approaches: Finite Element Method
   (FEM), Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) and Finite Difference Method
   (FDM). The numerical results were compared with experimental results in
   literature for validation purposes. Subsequently, a FEM simulation is
   carried out for a three dimensional domain to investigate the three
   dimensional effects of the enclosure's walls on heat transfer in the
   nanofluid. The simulations were performed for water (H2O)-aluminum
   oxide(Al2O3) nanofluid at a particle concentration range of 1\%-3\%
   volume fraction. Numerical results in the forms of temperature, stream
   function and velocity variations as well as average Nusselt number at
   the walls have been presented for a range of Rayleigh numbers (for
   different particles concentration). While, a suitable combination of the
   governing control parameters resulted in an acceptable CFD outcomes for
   all three numerical methods, some differences have been observed between
   different numerical approaches which are reported in this study.
   Eventually, the strength and weakness of various numerical approaches
   are discussed in details. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

   Highly selective olefin cyclization}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{183}},
Pages = {{396-404}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Olefin content minimization is critical for the long-term storage and
   long-distance transportation of oil product, which is commonly achieved
   through hydrogen saturation at high pressure to form paraffin. In this
   study, a novel catalytic process is reported to convert olefin to
   cycloalkane under methane environment with high selectivity. The main
   components of the product oil collected over Pd/ZSM-5 catalysts during
   olefin model compound (i.e., 1-decene) upgrading are cyclopentane,
   1-methylbutyl- and cyclopentane, hexyl-while there are more than 46
   species identified in the liquid product from the run with H-ZSM-5
   support engaged. The total selectivity of the aforementioned cycloalkane
   products is up to 91.3\% when 0.27 wt\% Pd/ZSM-5 catalyst is charged,
   thus making the product oil more profitable. The HRTEM and XPS data
   reveal that the highly dispersed palladium particles are in the form of
   PdOx. The results from pyridine FT-IR and NH3-TPD indicate that these
   PdOx species anchored onto the surface acidic sites exhibit the moderate
   acidic feature of Lewis acidic sites, which enhances the formation and
   stabilization of carbenium ion intermediates generated from 1-decene
   cracking. The strong interaction between PdOx species and surface acidic
   sites could not only stabilize the particle size and modify the
   electronic structure of Pd species but also modulate the acidic
   properties of ZSM-5 support, leading to promoted methane activation
   which would not only release sufficient hydrogen donors for preventing
   olefin aromatization, but also inhibit the over-cracking of carbenium
   ions. As a result, the selectivity of catalyst assisted olefin
   cyclization under methane environment is greatly enhanced. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Breast cancer is the most common cancer among Canadian women and the
   second cause of death from cancer. Fine needle aspirate (FNA) is a
   technology used to investigate early breast tumors to detect cancer. In
   this paper, we demonstrate the application of a new ordered weighted
   averaging operator (OWA) to the problem of breast tumor classification.
   The OWA operator employs the Laplace distribution to calculate the
   weight vector to aggregate the uncertain information about the breast
   tumors. The aggregated information is used along with the tumor label,
   i.e., benign or malignant, to train a nearest neighbor, support vector
   machine, and logistic regression classifiers. The result of this study
   based on the nearest neighbor classifier achieves 99.71\% accuracy that
   outperforms other studies that utilize other OWA operators using the
   same dataset. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has not conclusively demonstrated whether KHCO3
   formation occurs through the direct reaction of K2CO3 with gas phase CO2
   and H2O or via the intermediate formation of K2CO3 (1.5H(2)O). In this
   study, four sets of experiments, using regenerated and prehydrated
   K2CO3, were performed in different flue gas component mixtures to fully
   elucidate the reaction mechanism involved. The extents of carbonation
   and hydration were quantified by separately tracking CO2 and/or H2O
   uptakes and releases. Test results revealed regenerated K2CO3 to be most
   active for KHCO3 formation, while the carbonation of prehydrated samples
   was limited by their drying rates, proving that K2CO3. (1.5 H2O) cannot
   be directly converted to KHCO3. Therefore, K2CO3 carbonation and
   hydration are competing reversible reactions which occur in parallel
   through direct reaction with the flue gas components. The knowledge
   gained about the reaction mechanism provides the fundamental direction
   for future process design to make this technology practical.}},

Volume = {{126}},
Pages = {{662-672}},

Abstract = {{Analyzing wind turbine performance at low tip-speed ratio is challenging
   due to the relatively high level of swirl in the wake. This work
   presents a new approach to wind turbine analysis including swirl for any
   tip-speed ratio. The methodology uses the induced velocity field from
   vortex theory in the general momentum theory, in the form of the turbine
   thrust and torque equations. Using the constant bound circulation model
   of Joukowsky, the swirl velocity becomes infinite on the wake centreline
   even at high tip speed ratio. Rankine, Vatistas and Delery vortices were
   used to regularize the Joukowsky model near the centreline. The new
   formulation prevents the power coefficient from exceeding the Betz
   Joukowsky limit. An alternative calculation, based on the varying
   circulation for Betz-Goldstein optimized rotors is shown to have the
   best general behavior. Prandtl's approximation for the tip loss and a
   recent alternative were employed to account for the effects of a finite
   number of blades. The Betz-Goldstein model appears to be the only one
   resistant to vortex breakdown immediately behind the rotor for an
   infinite number of blades. Furthermore, the dependence of the induced
   velocity on radius in the Betz-Goldstein model allows the power
   coefficient to remain below Betz-Joukowsky limit which does not occur
   for the Joukowsky model at low tip-speed ratio. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Operational scheduling of microgrids via parametric programming}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{180}},
Pages = {{672-681}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{We present a parametric programming based approach for energy management
   in microgrids. An operational planning problem for a grid-connected
   microgrid with energy sources including solar photovoltaic, wind turbine
   and battery energy storage system, in addition to a household load
   demand, is captured as a parametric mixed-integer linear programming
   problem (p-MILP) through parameterizations of the uncertain coordinates
   of wind and solar energy resources. Thus, the energy management problem
   - typically nonlinear - is transformed into a linear hi-level
   optimization problem, where choice of the parameterization scheme is
   made at the upper level while system operation decisions are made at the
   lower level. The p-MILP formulation leads to significant improvements in
   uncertainty handling, solution quality and computational ease; by
   removing dependency of the solution on meteorological forecasts and
   avoiding the multiple computational cycles of the traditional online
   optimization techniques. The problem is solved offline on a flexible
   time-scale basis, allowing online implementation to be achievable on
   real-time system state updates. The proposed parametric programming
   approach extends the state-of-the-art in microgrid energy management
   methods and the results from various case studies are used to
   demonstrate the feasibility of our method. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The solubility and volumetric properties of H-2 and heavy hydrocarbons
   are important to the design of many chemical processes. In this paper, a
   simplified Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory
   (PC-SAFT) is chosen to model the solubility and volumetric properties of
   H-2/heavy alkanes and H-2/bitumen mixtures. The number of reduced
   density roots given by the simplified PC-SAFT is discussed and a robust
   procedure is employed to solve for the root with the lowest Gibbs free
   energy. The development of new H-2 parameters and the correlation of
   H-2-heavy alkane pairs for the simplified PC-SAFT is completed using
   extensive experimental data. The new parameters are applied with a
   developed bitumen characterization method to predict H-2 solubility in
   Athabasca Bitumen. The average absolute deviations (AADs) between the
   measured solubility data and the modeling results are within 0.57\% for
   the five H-2/heavy alkane systems and 0.69\% for the H-2/Athabasca
   bitumen systems. Finally, the density, thermal expansion coefficient,
   and compressibility of the systems are predicted over wide ranges of
   temperature and pressure. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{182}},
Pages = {{577-587}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{The upgrading of the petroleum cracking distillates using cheap methane
   rather than naturally unavailable hydrogen is an economically attractive
   process. This work clearly demonstrates the feasibility of
   methanotreating by directly using methane over zeolite-supported
   catalyst to convert olefins. The introduction of methane decreases the
   fraction of olefins and increases the fraction of paraffins in the
   liquid products obtained from the reaction using 1-decene as the olefin
   model compound when Ag-Ga/ZSM-5 is charged. It also improves the quality
   of liquid product in terms of higher HiC atomic ratio, higher heating
   value and lower bromine number. The interaction between olefins and
   methane on the surface of the catalyst is evidenced by DRIFT
   spectroscopy. When propylene is used as the olefin model compound, the
   shift of the peaks due to the interaction between adsorbed propylene
   species and catalyst surface as well as the generation of new peaks
   after the introduction of methane are observed. When 1-decene is used as
   the model compound, the suppressed intensity of -C=C- signal and
   enhanced alkane C-H bending peak intensity when CH4 is present indicate
   the conversion of olefins into paraffins. The improved particle
   dispersion of the charged catalyst upon the reaction under CH4
   environment is also noticed from the TEM images, which might be closely
   related to its better olefin upgrading performance. The outcomes from
   this study might create an alternative route for cracked distillates
   upgrading and provide a positive attempt for more valuable methane
   utilization. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrathin films of Nafion (R) have attracted significant attention in
   recent years owing to their application in a variety of electrochemical
   devices. For improved mechanical integrity, the films are often

   variable-temperature Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy study of
   ultra-thin (14 to 660 nm) Nafion films on SiO2/Si substrates in the
   attenuated total reflection mode. A key finding is the dramatic increase
   in the intensity of the 636-624 cm(-1) doublet band, generally
   associated with CF2 wagging or helix-reversal defect, observed at around
   110 degrees C during in situ heating. This onset temperature provides a
   molecular link to the a-transition temperature of bulk Nafion and is the
   first time such an observation has been made using infrared
   spectroscopy. Smaller changes in the intensity and/or a shift of the
   other peaks in the region 1300-900 cm(-1) were noted.}},

Title = {{A Unified Model for Gas Transfer in Nanopores of Shale-Gas Reservoirs:
   Coupling Pore Diffusion and Surface Diffusion}},

Abstract = {{A model for gas transfer in nanopores is the basis for accurate
   numerical simulation, which has important implications for economic
   development of shale-gas reservoirs (SGRs). The gastransfer mechanism in
   SGRs is significantly different from that of conventional gas
   reservoirs, which is mainly caused by the nano-scale phenomena and
   organic matter as a medium of gas sourcing and storage. The gas-transfer
   mechanism includes bulk-gas transfer and adsorption-gas surface
   diffusion in nanopores of SGRs, where the bulk-gas-transfer mechanism
   includes continuous flow, slip flow, and Knudsen diffusion. First, a
   model for bulk-gas transfer in nanopores was established, which was
   dependent on slip flow and Knudsen diffusion. The total gas flux in the
   bulk phase is not a simple sum of slip-flow flux and Knudsen-diffusion
   flux but a weighted sum on the basis of corresponding contributions. The
   weighted factors are primarily controlled by the mutual interaction
   between slip flow and Knudsen diffusion, which is determined by
   probabilities between gas molecules colliding with each other and
   colliding with nanopore surface in this newly proposed model. Second, a
   model for adsorbed-gas surface diffusion in nanopores was established,
   which was modeled after the Hwang and Kammermeyer (1966) model and
   considered the effect of gas coverage under a high-pressure condition.
   Finally, with the combination of these two models, a unified model for
   gas transport in nanopores of SGRs was established, and this model was
   validated through molecular simulation and experimental data. Results
   show that:
   Slip flow makes a great contribution to gas transfer under the condition
   of meso/macropores (pore radius greater than 2 nm) and high pressure.
   Knudsen diffusion makes an important contribution to gas transfer under
   the condition of macropores (pore radius greater than 50 nm) and less
   than 1 MPa in pressure, whereas it can be ignored in other cases.
   A surface-diffusion coefficient is comparable with a porediffusion
   coefficient, and gas transfer is always dominated by surface diffusion
   over all the ranges of pressure in micropores (pore radius <= 2 nm).
   Surface-diffusion contribution decreases with an increase in pore size,
   isosteric sorption heat, pressure, and temperature in SGRs.}},

Abstract = {{The viscosity of bitumen and heavy oil is extremely high at both
   reservoir and surface conditions, on the order of 1 million cp.
   Therefore, viscosity reduction is necessary for production from the
   reservoir, pipeline transportation, and oil processing. The aim of this
   study is to evaluate the effect of different parameters (temperature,
   pressure, and solvent-weight fraction) on the density and viscosity of
   bitumen-containing mixtures. Thus, the density and viscosity of mixtures
   are measured for a sample of Athabasca bitumen diluted with different
   fractions of toluene at pressures from 0.1 to 10 MPa and at temperatures
   from 22 to 190 degrees C. The mixture densities show a linear decrease
   with temperature, pressure, and solvent concentration. The viscosity of
   the mixtures indicates a curvilinear trend with respect to the
   solvent-weight fraction and temperature. The effect of pressure on the
   mixture viscosity is more pronounced at lower-solvent-weight fractions.
   The mixture-density data are evaluated with two different methods: no
   volume change upon mixing and excess volume. The excess-volume method
   predicts the mixture-density data with an overall average absolute
   relative deviation (AARD) of 0.34\%. The viscosity data for mixtures are
   compared with different models: Arrhenius (1987), Cragoe (1933), Shu
   (1984), Lobe (1973), double-log (Yarranton et al. 2013), Lederer (1933),
   power-law (Kendall and Monroe 1917), and Bij (Yarranton et al. 2013).
   The Bij model (Yarranton et al. 2013) produces the most-reliable results
   for mixture viscosities, with 5.5\% AARD.}},

Abstract = {{Li et al. (2004) described three zones at the edge of steam chambers on
   the basis of drainage conditions: drained, partially drained, and
   undrained. In the drained zone, the pore pressure is controlled by
   injection pressure, and fluid mobility within this region is sufficient
   to drain additional pore pressures because of shear dilation and
   pore-fluid thermal expansion. The undrained zone lies beyond the
   partially drained zone and extends to virgin reservoir far beyond the
   chamber. In this zone shearing behaves under undrained conditions; by
   this, Li et al. (2004) mean no volume change occurs but shear lead to
   changes in pore pressure. Li et al. (2004) proposed that the boundaries
   of these zones are dependent on bitumen viscosity, which relates to the
   temperature distribution beyond the steam interface. Because
   drained/undrained conditions affect the geomechanics at the edge of the
   chamber, we investigate whether the assumption of Li et al. (2004) that
   there is no volume change within the sheared zone is correct and is
   supported by field data. Here, we establish the physics associated with
   the undrained zone at the edge of steam-assisted gravity-drainage steam
   chamber and explore the pressure front vs. temperature front of
   different oil-sand field projects. The results reveal that the drained
   zone governed by pressure-front advancement is greater in extent than
   the sheared zone. The thermodynamics of the undrained zone are discussed
   to derive a new theory for mechanothermal phenomena at the edge of the
   chamber. The results from the theory show that the drained zone extends
   beyond the temperature front and thus, from a geomechanical point of
   view, the system solely consists of the drained and partially drained
   zones.}},

Title = {{Computer-aided diagnosis of retinopathy in retinal fundus images of
   preterm infants via quantification of vascular tortuosity}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING}},

Abstract = {{Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), a disorder of the retina occurring in
   preterm infants, is the leading cause of preventable childhood
   blindness. An active phase of ROP that requires treatment is associated
   with the presence of plus disease, which is diagnosed clinically in a
   qualitative manner by visual assessment of the existence of a certain
   level of increase in the thickness and tortuosity of retinal vessels.
   The present study performs computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of plus
   disease via quantitative measurement of tortuosity in retinal fundus
   images of preterm infants. Digital image processing techniques were
   developed for the detection of retinal vessels and measurement of their
   tortuosity. The total lengths of abnormally tortuous vessels in each
   quadrant and the entire image were then computed. A minimum-length
   diagnostic-decision-making criterion was developed to assess the
   diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the values obtained. The area
   (A(z)) under the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to
   assess the overall diagnostic accuracy of the methods. Using a set of 19
   retinal fundus images of preterm infants with plus disease and 91
   without plus disease, the proposed methods provided an overall
   diagnostic accuracy of A(z) = 0.98. Using the total length of all
   abnormally tortuous vessel segments in an image, our techniques are
   capable of CAD of plus disease with high accuracy without the need for
   manual selection of vessels to analyze. The proposed methods may be used
   in a clinical or teleophthalmological setting. (C) 2016 Society of

Abstract = {{The wake of a normal thin flat plate of aspect ratio 3.2 was studied in
   comparison to that of an infinite span (2D) plate at Reynolds number of
   1200 (based on the common dimension of the two plates) using Direct
   Numerical Simulations. The presence of side-edge shear layers suppressed
   the spanwise instabilities responsible for the three distinct flow
   regimes in the wake of 2D plates. There was a vortex ``peeling{''}
   mechanism that detached the vortices in the shear layers on the shorter
   sides. It increased the Strouhal number to 0.317 from 0.158 for 2D
   plates. It is also associated with increased entrainment of freestream
   fluid and a reduction in the mean recirculation length by 40\% to 1.6h.
   Moreover, the peeling mechanism led to formation of interlocked vortex
   loops outside the base region. The maximum turbulence kinetic energy
   along the wake centreline for the 3D case was 76\% lower than for the 2D
   flow. Vortex detachment was constrained to the plate sharp corners in
   contrast to the most common example of thin flat bodies (circular flat
   disks). This difference lead to a relatively higher vortex shedding
   frequency for flat plates. The side-edge vortices are associated with a
   secondary induced flow behind the plate, which formed two interlocked
   vortex loops and resulted in formation of separating vortex streets in
   the wake (wake split). Two opposing in-wash flows (in the chordwise
   direction) were observed accompanied by a similar system of out-wash
   flows (normal to the plate chord), which increased the freestream fluid
   entrainment. The in-wash flow contracted the wake in the plane of the
   chord. The out-wash flow expanded the wake in the spanwise direction and
   resulted in two counter-rotating vortex streets. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Music emotion recognition (MER) is a challenging field of studies that
   has been addressed in multiple disciplines such as cognitive science,
   physiology, psychology, musicology, and arts. In this paper, music
   emotions are modeled as a set of continuous variables composed of
   valence and arousal (VA) values based on the Valence-Arousal model. MER
   is formulated as a regression problem where 548 dimensions of music
   features were extracted and selected. A wide range of methods including
   multivariate adaptive regression spline, support vector regression
   (SVR), radial basis function, random forest regression (RFR), and
   regression neural networks are adopted to recognize music emotions.
   Experimental results show that these regression algorithms have led to
   good regression effect for MER. The optimal R-2 statistics and VA values
   are 29.3\% and 62.5\%, respectively, which are obtained by the RFR and
   SVR algorithms in the relief feature space.}},

   efficient response distribution function (ERDF) is developed to
   interpolate the array response for an arbitrary scatterer location. It
   is shown that the mutual information of the proposed model is consistent

Abstract = {{A transverse pressure pulse decay (TPPD) method is presented to measure
   transverse permeability of tight reservoir cores in a cell with finite
   volume. Given appropriate assumptions, a mathematical model based on the
   specially designed experiment is formulated, and its general solution is
   proposed. Early-time and late-time techniques are further presented for
   convenient postprocessing applications of experimental data. Meanwhile,
   sensitivity analysis of TPPD method is given. It is found that a good
   TPPD experimental principle can be obtained by adjusting test gas,
   experimental pressure, dimension of core sample, and volume ratio
   (lambda). The volume ratio error (lambda(error)) analysis reveals the
   following: (1) a larger lambda(error) results in increased transverse
   permeability error (k(error)); (2) the volume ratio (lambda) is better
   not very close to 0.754; (3) when lambda is equal to or greater than 1,
   the k(error) resulting from lambda(error) is monotonic decreasing as the
   volume ratio increases. In practice, lambda is usually equal to or
   greater than 1 due to the very small pore volume of a tight core. But
   this does not mean that the volume ratio should be as large as possible.
   The reason for this is that a pressure transducer with higher resolution
   is needed to record pressure change. That means experimental apparatus
   is much more costly. And such a TPPD experiment requires a much longer
   time to attain the late-time straight line behavior. The best choice is
   to find an optimal balance point among experimental cost, time, and
   accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{The present study presents a new technique for reconstructing the

   time-resolved, planar, two-component particle image velocimetry data
   collected in multiple orthogonal planes. The technique produces
   conditionally averaged flow field reconstructions based on a pattern
   recognition analysis of velocity fields. It is validated on the wake of
   a low-aspect ratio dual step cylinder geometry, consisting of a large
   diameter cylinder (D) with small aspect ratio (L/D) attached to the
   mid-span of a small diameter cylinder (d). For a dual step cylinders
   with D/d = 2, and L/D = 1, numerical and experimental data are
   considered for Re-D = 150 (laminar wake) and for Re-D = 2100 (turbulent
   wake). The results show that the proposed technique successfully
   reconstructs the dominant periodic wake vortex interactions and can be
   extended to a wide range of turbulent flows.}},

   the development of skin disease models is still limited and needs to be

Journal = {{GAIT \& POSTURE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{60-68}},

Abstract = {{Wedged insoles are believed to be of clinical benefit to individuals
   with knee osteoarthritis by reducing the knee adduction moment (KAM)
   during gait. However, previous clinical trials have not specifically
   controlled for KAM reduction at baseline, thus it is unknown if reduced
   KAMs actually confer a clinical benefit. Forty-eight participants with
   medial knee osteoarthritis were randomly assigned to either a control
   group where no footwear intervention was given, or a wedged insole group
   where KAM reduction was confirmed at baseline. KAMs, Knee Injury and
   Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and Physical Activity Scale for the
   Elderly (PASE) scores were measured at baseline. KOOS and PASE surveys
   were re administered at three months follow-up. The wedged insole group
   did not experience a statistically significant or clinically meaningful
   change in KOOS pain over three months (p =0.173). Furthermore, there was
   no association between change in KAM magnitude and change in KOOS pain
   over three months within the wedged insole group (R-2 = 0.02, p =
   0.595). Improvement in KOOS pain for the wedged insole group was
   associated with worse baseline pain, and a change in PASE score over the
   three month study (R-2 = 0.57, p = 0.007). As an exploratory comparison,
   there was no significant difference in change in KOOS pain (p = 0.49)
   between the insole and control group over three months. These results
   suggest that reduced KAMs do not appear to provide any clinical benefit
   compared to no intervention over a follow-up period of three months. (C)

Abstract = {{Simultaneous nitric-oxide and atomic-oxygen laser-induced-fluorescence
   experiments were performed in the Hypersonic Materials Environmental
   Test System facility at the NASA Langley Research Center. The data serve
   as an experimental database for validation for chemical and thermal
   nonequilibrium models used in hypersonic flows. Measurements were taken
   over a wide range of stagnation enthalpies (6.7-18.5 MJ/kg) using an
   Earth atmosphere simulant with a composition of 75\% nitrogen, 20\%
   oxygen, and 5\% argon (by volume). These are the first simultaneous
   measurements of nitric-oxide and atomic-oxygen laser-induced
   fluorescence to be reported in literature for the Hypersonic Materials
   Environmental Test System facility. The maximum atomic-oxygen
   laser-induced-fluorescence mean signal intensity was observed at a
   stagnation enthalpy of approximately 12 MJ/kg, whereas the maximum
   nitric-oxide laser-induced-fluorescence mean signal intensity was
   observed at a stagnation enthalpy of 6.7 MJ/kg. The experimental results
   were compared to a fluorescence model that assumes equilibrium
   conditions in the plenum and frozen chemistry in an isentropic nozzle
   expansion (Mach 5). The equilibrium calculations were performed using
   CANTERA v2.1.1 with 16 species. The fluorescence model captured the
   correlation in mean atomic-oxygen laser-induced-fluorescence and
   nitric-oxide laser-induced-fluorescence signal intensities over a large
   range of stagnation enthalpies tested. The agreement between equilibrium
   calculations and the experimental laser-induced fluorescence signals was
   better for nitric oxide than atomic oxygen. Very weak correlations
   between single-shot atomic-oxygen laser-induced-fluorescence and
   nitric-oxide laser-induced-fluorescence intensities were observed in the
   experiments at all of the stagnation enthalpy conditions. It was found
   that the overall magnitude of nitric-oxide laser-induced-fluorescence
   fluctuations was much larger than atomic-oxygen
   laser-induced-fluorescence fluctuations.}},

Abstract = {{Traffic offloading among coexisting heterogeneous radio access
   technologies (RATs), i.e., inter-RAT offloading, is considered to be an
   effective strategy for enhancing the capacity of wireless networks and
   reducing the power consumption of both base stations (BSs) and mobile
   stations (MSs). To fully utilize inter-RAT offloading advantages, a
   mobility-aware evaluation is needed, which takes into account the
   combined effects of mobility and MS and BS spatial distributions on the
   performance gains. This paper proposes a novel analytical model that
   accurately describes MS mobility dynamics in heterogeneous wireless
   networks, while conveying detailed information on its location. In
   addition, this paper derives an analytical expression for calculating
   the packet loss probability for
   orthogonal-frequency-division-multiple-access (OFDMA)-based networks.
   Taking users' mobility and spatial distribution into account, this paper
   develops a Markovian-based framework for evaluating inter-RAT offloading
   performance. The accuracy of the proposed mobility model and the
   efficacy of the proposed performance evaluation framework are validated.
   Results show that MS mobility and vertical handover (VHO) cost
   significantly affect inter-RAT offloading performance, and ignoring
   their effects could lead to an inaccurate evaluation. When the effects
   of MS mobility and VHO cost on the performance are ignored, utilizing
   inter-RAT offloading decreases the packet loss probability by 9\% and
   saves energy by 6\%. However, accounting for these effects results in a
   32\% increase in the packet loss probability evaluation and a 64\%
   increase in the energy consumption evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{Earned value management (EVM) is a critical project management
   methodology that evaluates and predicts project performance from cost
   and schedule perspectives. The novel theoretical framework presented in
   this paper estimates future performance of a project based on the past
   performance data. The model benefits from a fuzzy time series
   forecasting model in the estimation process. Furthermore, fuzzy-based
   estimation is developed using linguistic terms to interpret different
   possible conditions of projects. Eventually, data envelopment analysis
   is applied to determine the superior model for forecasting of project
   performance. Multiple illustrative cases and simulated data have been
   used for comparative analysis and to illustrate the applicability of
   theoreticalmodel to real situations. Contrary to EVM-based approach,
   which assumes the future performance is the same as the past, the
   proposed model can greatly assist project managers in more realistically
   assessing prospective performance of projects and thereby taking
   necessary and on-time appropriate actions.}},

Title = {{Assessment of Receiver Signal Strength Sensing for Location Estimation
   Based on Fisher Information}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Currently there is almost ubiquitous availability of wireless signaling
   for data communications within commercial building complexes resulting
   in receiver signal strength (RSS) observables that are typically
   sufficient for generating viable location estimates of mobile wireless
   devices. However, while RSS observables are generally plentiful,
   achieving an accurate estimation of location is difficult due to several
   factors affecting the electromagnetic coupling between the mobile
   antenna and the building access points that are not modeled and hence
   contribute to the overall estimation uncertainty. Such uncertainty is
   typically mitigated with a moderate redundancy of RSS sensor
   observations in combination with other constraints imposed on the mobile
   trajectory. In this paper, the Fisher Information (FI) of a set of RSS
   sensor observations in the context of variables related to the mobile
   location is developed. This provides a practical method of determining
   the potential location accuracy for the given set of wireless signals
   available. Furthermore, the information value of individual RSS
   measurements can be quantified and the RSS observables weighted
   accordingly in estimation combining algorithms. The practical utility of
   using FI in this context was demonstrated experimentally with an
   extensive set of RSS measurements recorded in an office complex. The
   resulting deviation of the mobile location estimation based on
   application of weighted likelihood processing to the experimental RSS
   data was shown to agree closely with the Cramer Rao bound determined
   from the FI analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Wearable electronic devices have experienced increasing development with
   the advances in the semiconductor industry and have received more

Abstract = {{Most one-of-a-kind production (OKP) products are complex-shaped
   structural components, where there are only few identical OKP interim
   products in the same batch. OKP flexible interim product production has
   the nature of multi-criteria production; the multi-criteria production
   characteristics correspond to different manufacturing technologies and
   methods. How to reasonably and effectively determine group/batch
   production schemes of OKP interim products has become a key strategic
   consideration in OKP enterprises' multi-criteria production decisions.
   The primary problem of the current multi-criteria evaluation method is
   how to judge the matrix scale and determine the weight set, which
   primarily depends on the rich experience of relevant specialists. These
   subjective decisions make the evaluation results prone to disagreements.
   To comprehensively and scientifically evaluate the production processes
   influenced by the complicated factors in OKP, we establish an influence
   factor system and present a method that combines subjective and
   objective weights based on entropy and an analytic network process
   (ANP). The method avoids a multifarious optimizing process. In addition,
   this is a novel attempt to use fuzzy comprehensive evaluation based on
   ANP in production scheme optimization, which to an extent, enriches
   process optimization methods in manufacturing. Through case studies, we
   demonstrate our methods feasibility and rationality. The improved
   evaluation result provides support for multi criteria production
   decisions of interim products in OKP. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Low light imaging is being researched intensively. The applications of
   increased sensitivity sensors expand to biomedicine, security, and
   communications providing low-cost and effective alternatives to common
   imaging techniques based on microscopes, intensifiers, etc. Lowering the
   inherent noise floor and achieving a higher sensitivity in a
   complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensor are found at the
   focus of the scientific society, and new solutions emerge quickly.
   Methods such as output averaging, active reset, and active column
   sensing lower the noise floor but fail to provide the sensitivity boost,
   which requires a substantial signal amplification. The already proposed
   solutions, combining high gain and noise suppression, still fall short
   of the sensitivity that would enable detecting a few electrons. This
   brief proposes a very sensitive pixel that is designed to capture an
   ultralow illumination using three stage amplifiers' configuration, which
   allows for an effective reset operation and in-pixel analog-to-digital
   conversion. The provided measurement results prove the functionality of

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{67}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{For several classes of soft biological tissues, modelling complexity is
   in part due to the arrangement of the collagen fibres. In general, the
   arrangement of the fibres can be described by defining, at each point in
   the tissue, the structure tensor (i.e. the tensor product of the unit
   vector of the local fibre arrangement by itself) and a probability
   distribution of orientation. In this approach, assuming that the fibres
   do not interact with each other, the overall contribution of the
   collagen fibres to a given mechanical property of the tissue can be
   estimated by means of an averaging integral of the constitutive function
   describing the mechanical property at study over the set of all possible
   directions in space. Except for the particular case of fibre
   constitutive functions that are polynomial in the transversely isotropic
   invariants of the deformation, the averaging integral cannot be
   evaluated directly, in a single calculation because, in general, the
   integrand depends both on deformation and on fibre orientation in a
   non-separable way. The problem is thus, in a sense, analogous to that of
   solving the integral of a function of two variables, which cannot be
   split up into the product of two functions, each depending only on one
   of the variables. Although numerical schemes can be used to evaluate the
   integral at each deformation increment, this is computationally
   expensive. With the purpose of containing computational costs, this work
   proposes approximation methods that are based on the direct
   integrability of polynomial functions and that do not require the
   step-by-step evaluation of the averaging integrals. Three different
   methods are proposed: (a) a Taylor expansion of the fibre constitutive
   function in the transversely isotropic invariants of the deformation;
   (b) a Taylor expansion of the fibre constitutive function in the
   structure tensor; (c) for the case of a fibre constitutive function
   having a polynomial argument, an approximation in which the directional
   average of the constitutive function is replaced by the constitutive
   function evaluated at the directional average of the argument. Each of
   the proposed methods approximates the averaged constitutive function in
   such a way that it is multiplicatively decomposed into the product of a
   function of the deformation only and a function of the structure tensors
   only. In order to assess the accuracy of these methods, we evaluate the
   constitutive functions of the elastic potential and the Cauchy stress,
   for a biaxial test, under different conditions, i.e. different fibre
   distributions and different ratios of the nominal strains in the two
   directions. The results are then compared against those obtained for an
   averaging method available in the literature, as well as against the
   integration made at each increment of deformation.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the work discussed in this article was to determine the
   ability of an MnP augmented aerobic waste cell to reach stable
   conditions rapidly in terms of gas production, nutrient content and
   cellulose and hemicellulose to lignin ratio (C + H/L). Two types of
   experiments were conducted; small batch and laboratory scale lysimeter
   experiments. Results from batch experiments showed that enzyme added
   treatments have the capability to reach a stable C + H/L and lower gas
   production rates, faster than the treatments without enzyme addition.
   Enzyme enhancement of the lysimeter increased the rate of
   biodegradability of the waste; gas production increased more than two
   times and there was clear evidence of increase in nutrients (nitrogen,
   dissolved carbon, biological oxygen demand) in the lysimeter leachate.

Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{The vapor pressure, liquid heat capacity, and heat of combustion were
   measured for distillation cuts obtained from several heavy oils using a
   deep vacuum fractionation apparatus. Derivatives of fitted vapor
   pressure equations were used to determine heats of vaporization based on
   the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Existing correlations were evaluated
   against these data and new correlations were proposed including a
   generalized Cox vapor pressure correlation (as a function of molecular
   weight and boiling point temperature) and a correlation for the heat of
   vaporization based on the generalized Cox equation. Two versions of
   Tsonopoulos correlations were developed for liquid heat capacity: one
   using the Watson Factor and another using the H/C ratio. In general, the
   new correlations improved the prediction of heavy cut properties
   compared with correlations from the literature and performed similarly
   for light cuts (both for the development dataset and for independent
   test datasets). In addition, the heats of combustion of some cuts were
   measured and used to validate the elemental analysis based correlations
   from the literature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Slippage and phase change are important factors which are affected on
   the permeability of gas in tight media. When dealing with
   micro/nano-scale media, conventional equations breaks down and can not
   be used to characterize gas transport in tight media. In this paper, we
   study gas transport in tight porous media to explore effects of the
   condensation and different types of gas molecule surface scattering on
   the permeability. Using the kinetic theory of gases and with an analogy
   between heat transfer and mass transfer, we derive first a formula for
   the effective mass diffusion coefficient in tight porous media. In
   particular, effects of the pore size, condensed phase saturation and
   grain surface roughness are determined. Then, the introduced model for
   the effective mass diffusion coefficient is implement to the dusty gas
   method to make it applicable for our investigation purposes. The
   well-known Kozeny-Carman equations and the fractal techniques are used
   to predict the absolute permeability of tight porous media. Our
   predictions for both self-diffusivity coefficient and the permeability
   are in good agreement with experimental data and numerical simulations.

Abstract = {{Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (PC-SAFT) shows
   promising prediction results for the vapor-liquid equilibrium and
   density of many hydrocarbon systems. In this work, a simplified version
   of PC-SAFT is applied to predict the multiphase equilibrium of bitumen
   with C2H6, C3H8 and CO2. More specifically, the simplified PC-SAFT and a
   previously proposed bitumen characterization for vapor-liquid
   equilibrium (VL2E) modeling are adopted to predict the multiphase
   boundaries of Athabasca Bitumen and Peace River Bitumen systems. The
   multiphase boundaries indicate good agreement with the phase boundary
   data over a wide range of temperature and pressure. In addition, the
   simplified PC-SAFT and Peng-Robinson Equation of State are applied to
   predict the mutual solubility and density under liquid-liquid
   equilibrium (L1L2E) and are tested against the measured data of bitumen
   and C2H6 system. It has been found that the prediction results by the
   simplified PC-SAFT are more reliable. The simplified PC-SAFT gives an
   average absolute relative deviation (AARD) of 13.1\% for solubility and
   an AARD of 3.7\% for density, whereas Peng-Robinson Equation of State
   gives an AARD of 15.7\% for solubility and an AARD of 4.2\% for density.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Aqueous chlorine (Cl2, OCl-, Cl-) in combination with longer wavelength
   ultraviolet (UV) irradiation has been investigated as a potential
   advanced oxidation process (AOP) for water and wastewater treatment. The
   cases include bleaching of organic matter (NOM) and oil sands tailing
   pond water (OSPW) under sunlight irradiation. Surprisingly, low energy
   tail of OCl- (Amax at 290nm) has been postulated to be responsible for
   degradation of organic components. An alternative photoreaction,
   potentially more photon efficient, postulates absorption by strongly
   absorbing chromophores of target compounds present in water, which then
   undergo reaction in their excited states. This alternate hypothesis was
   tested in the current study under 440nm light-emitting diode (LED)
   irradiation, where chlorine species have no absorption, using Swannee
   River fulvic acid (SRFA), an oil sands process water, and by bleaching
   of a coumarin dye. All results show substantial enhancement of
   hypochlorite oxidation processes under irradiation of the various
   complex mixtures of organic chromophores at 440nm, where chlorine
   species offer no measurable absorbance that can compete with the organic
   chromophores in the complex mixtures. In the fulvic acid case, a known
   long-lived triplet excited state is a plausible active species that may
   be a contributor. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Volume = {{146}},

Abstract = {{In this work, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were
   performed to determine the oil/water volume fraction distribution and
   wall shear stress in oil-water two phase fluid flow in pipelines. A CFD
   based empirical model was developed to predict the corrosion rate of
   pipelines in CO2-containing oil water two phase flow. The flow pattern
   simulation is able to locate potential corrosion occurrence in pipelines
   by identifying the sites for water accumulation. For horizontal pipes,
   at low flow velocities, i.e., 0.2, 03 and 0.5 m/s, the water phase
   accumulates at the bottom of the pipe. For upward inclined pipelines, at
   low flow velocities, the water phase accumulates at the bottom of the
   pipe, especially the upward part of the inclined pipe, even in fluids
   containing a very small amount of water, such as 5\% water. For downward
   inclined pipelines, at low flow velocities, both the straight and the
   downward parts of the pipe around the elbow are the locations to
   accumulate water, presenting the likely area for corrosion to occur. The
   water-wetting of the pipe wall can be improved by increasing the flow
   velocity. The maximum wall shear stress is observed at the top of the
   elbow and the bottom of the upper part of the upward inclined pipe,
   where an accelerated corrosion would be experienced. For the downward
   inclined pipe, the bottom of the elbow and the top of the downward part
   of the pipe experience the highest wall shear stress. The bottom of the
   elbow may suffer from enhanced corrosion. The CFD based empirical model
   is able to predict corrosion rate of pipelines, with the modeling
   results validated by actual measurements. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Mechanistic modeling of low salinity water flooding}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{146}},
Pages = {{191-209}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Low salinity waterflood (LSW) has become an attractive enhanced oil
   recovery (EOR) method as it shows more advantages than conventional
   chemical EOR methods in terms of chemical costs, environmental impact,
   and field process implementation. Extensive laboratory studies in the
   past two decades have proposed several pore-scale mechanisms of oil
   displacement during LSW flooding, which are still open for discussion.
   However, the capability of reservoir simulators to model accurately this
   process is very limited. This paper provides a critical review of the
   state of the art in research and field applications of LSW. The focus is
   on a widely agreed mechanism that is the wettability alteration from
   preferential oil wetness to water wetness of formation rock surfaces.
   Ion exchange and geochemical reactions have been experimentally found to
   be important in oil mobilization due to enhanced water spreading at low
   salinity. To evaluate the significance of this surface wetting
   mechanism, a comprehensive ion exchange model with geochemical processes
   has been developed and coupled to the multi-phase multi-component flow
   equations in an equation-of-state compositional simulator. This new
   model captures most of the important physical and chemical phenomena
   that occur in LSW, including intra-aqueous reactions, mineral
   dissolution/precipitation, ion exchange and wettability alteration.
   The proposed LSW model is tested using the low-salinity core-flood
   experiments reported by Fjelde et al. (2012) for a North Sea reservoir
   and the low-salinity and high-salinity heterogeneous core-flood
   experiments by Rivet (2009) for a Texas reservoir. Excellent agreements
   between the model and the experiments in terms of effluent ion
   concentrations, effluent pH, and oil recovery were achieved. In
   addition, the model was also proved to be highly comparable with the
   ion-exchange model of the geochemistry software PHREEQC for both low
   salinity and high salinity (Appelo, 1994). Important observations in
   laboratory and field tests such as a local pH increase, a decrease in
   divalent effluent concentration, mineralogy contributions, and the
   influence of connate water and injected brine compositions can be
   reproduced with the proposed LSW model. Built in a robust reservoir
   simulator, it serves as a powerful tool for LSW design and the
   interpretation of process performance in field tests.
   Although the advantages of LSW have been reported, none of the
   systematic approaches has addressed the issues of modeling and
   predicting LSW field-scale performance. The new modeling approach
   introduced in this research can effectively capture the critical effects
   of geology in the LSW process. This integrated modeling approach
   involves the use of geological software, a reservoir simulator, and a
   robust optimizer in a closed loop for sensitivity analysis, history
   matching, optimization, and uncertainty assessment. The field-scale
   benefits of secondary and tertiary LSW are then addressed. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Nanoparticle (NP)-stabilized foams can be generated at extreme
   water-deficient conditions (with quality as high as 95-99\%) and yet
   with apparent viscosities > 100 cP. This makes them greatly appealing
   for hydraulic fracturing applications, where minimal water consumption
   and leak-off to the reservoir are desired. Initial assessment of
   propensities of these novel fluids for fracturing applications requires
   field scale simulations. However, conventional fracturing models are
   difficult to employ because they do not consider true foam
   hydrodynamics. We have developed a mathematical model to simulate the
   transport of NP-stabilized foams for hydraulic fracturing. The model
   combines fluid transport in reservoir matrix and fracture with rock
   mechanics equations and thus allows for considering the effects of foam
   on fracture dynamics. Gas and water flow with mechanistic accounting of
   foam generation and coalescence are simulated using population balance
   models. Transport of nanoparticles through porous media was simulated
   using single site filtration model. The equations are discretized using
   finite-difference scheme. Settari's approach is used to embed fracture's
   moving boundary with the matrix to accordingly update transmissibility.
   Model's capabilities are verified with examples on fracture growth and
   fracture clean up processes to illustrate the benefits of using the
   NP-stabilized high quality foams. Fracture propagation was simulated for
   water, a conventional viscous fracpad and NP-stabilized foams of
   different qualities and textures. The simulations confirmed that larger
   foam viscosity generated wider fractures with smaller fracture
   half-length. In addition, fracture cleanup simulations show that
   fracturing fluid cleanup for foam based fracturing fluids could take the
   order of 10 days as opposed to that of viscous fracpad which could take
   up to 1000 days; demonstrating the advantage of using dry foams. (C)

Pages = {{515-525}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Numerical experiments are performed to evaluate the capability and
   examine the computational costs and tradeoffs of numerical and
   analytical approaches for apparent gas permeability calculation.
   Considering the dominance of capillary force in pore-level
   microstructures, two-phase distribution maps are constructed within
   micro- and nano-scale media using a quasi-static pore morphology-based
   technique. At each equilibrium step, the gas saturation profile is
   extracted to conduct single phase flow simulations and predict the gas
   effective permeability. To investigate the effect of gas slippage on the
   accuracy of the results, both Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and
   Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) techniques are applied in a wide
   range of gas pressures. The results reveal that the continuum theory is
   valid for a specific pore size and gas pressure range and its accuracy
   is strongly dependent on the Knudsen number value. DSMC simulation case
   studies demonstrate that in case of proper medium characterization, a
   tuned Klinkenberg correlation is capable of providing satisfying
   predictions within both slippage and transition flow regimes. (C) 2016

Title = {{Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS): Hydraulic fracturing in a
   thermo-poroelastic framework}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{146}},
Pages = {{1179-1191}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The natural permeability of geothermal reservoirs is typically low and
   therefore needs to be enhanced to enable efficient use and economic
   viability. Hydraulic Fracturing (HF) methods, often referred to as
   hydraulic stimulation, are one of the primary methods used for
   permeability enhancement. In this research paper, physical processes
   associated with HF are simulated within a thermo-poroelastic (THM)
   framework. A fracturing model is introduced as a novel component to the
   THM framework. This fracturing model is expressed in terms of Terzaghi's
   effective stress and it governs fracture length and aperture evolution
   in all directions of space. The distribution and properties of new
   fractures are used in a parametric analysis to calculate anisotropic
   fracture-induced permeability tensor at each point in the computational
   grid. Mechanical, hydraulic, and thermal effects interact in different
   ways at the vicinity of the inlet and of the outlet. Our results show
   that thermal cooling primarily contributes to the fracturing process
   within a zone close to the inlet. In addition, injection pressure and/or
   flow rate must be increased during the lifetime of the reservoir to
   compensate for pressure drop caused by increased aperture due to
   fracture growth.
   We tested our fracturing model at the laboratory scale using
   observations from a homogeneous triaxial test. The model is then
   integrated into an in-house FORTRAN 90 finite element code that solves
   the thermo-poroelastic boundary value problem. Numerical simulations for
   fluid circulation and thermal recovery at the geothermal reservoir of
   Soultz-sous-Forets are performed using the fully integrated code.
   As expected, at early times heat convection controls the spatial
   progression of the effective stresses and hydraulic permeability from
   inlet to outlet. However, the enhancement of permeability due to HF
   causes a rapid propagation of the heat front in the reservoir.
   Therefore, the applied injection flow rate effectively controls the
   evolution of the hydraulic permeability at moderate-to-long times of the
   HF process. The borehole stability against shear failure is also
   investigated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The timing error between global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and

   INS aiding delay, and analyze the effect of INS aiding delay on the
   tracking errors in details. In addition, an integrated hardware deeply
   coupled system platform was developed to verify the impact of time delay
   on INS-aided PLLs. Simulation and field vehicles testing results
   demonstrate that the tracking error of the INS-aided PLL caused by
   aiding delay increases with the lengthening of the delay time, the
   compression of the bandwidth, and the increase in the acceleration.
   Testing results verify the proposed model.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a theoretical analysis of multiple-input
   multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing in the
   presence of nonlinear dual-band power amplifiers. A two-dimensional
   memory polynomial model is used to describe the dual-band power
   amplifier. It is analytically shown that the effect of nonlinearity
   impairment in the transmitter can be modeled by a complex coefficient
   and a nonlinear additive noise. An analytical formulation is provided
   for symbol error rate (SER) of this system considering a frequency
   selective MIMO channel. The experimental results have been deployed to
   extract a realistic model for a dual-band amplifier. Also, the model of
   the linearized power amplifier has been extracted after applying digital
   pre-distortion (DPD). The proposed model is validated by simulation for
   2 x 2 and 2 x 4 MIMO systems. The results show that the analytical model
   maps well onto the simulation. Also, it is shown that the DPD is able to
   compensate for the nonlinearity effect of the dual-band power amplifier

Abstract = {{This paper presents an algorithm for navigating in challenging indoor
   environments that do not have WiFi. Dead-reckoning (DR) based on
   off-the-shelf smartphone sensors and magnetic matching (MM) based on
   indoor magnetic features are integrated. For DR, we utilize a two-filter
   algorithm structure and multi-level constraints to navigate under
   different human motion conditions. For MM, we use several approaches to
   enhance its performance. These approaches include multi-dimensional
   dynamic time warping, weighted k-nearest neighbor, and utilization of
   magnetic gradient fingerprints. Furthermore, realized that the key to
   enhance the DR/MM performance is to mitigate the impact of MM
   mismatches, we introduced and evaluated two mismatch-detection
   approaches, including a threshold-based method that sets the measurement
   noises of MM positions based on their distances to the historical DR/MM
   position solutions, and an adaptive Kalman filter-based method that
   introduces the estimation of the innovation sequence covariance into the
   calculation of the gain matrix instead of adjusting the measurement
   noises. The proposed mismatch-detection mechanism reduced the DR/MM
   errors by 45.9\%-67.9\% in indoor tests with two smartphones, in two
   buildings, and under four motion conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Current measures of knee joint laxity, such as those found clinically
   using the KT-2000 arthrometer, are not highly repeatable or reliable by

   noninvasive in vivo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-based measure of
   laxity, the knee loading apparatus (KLA) with anterior positioning
   frame, was evaluated with five normal subjects (repeatability study, n =
   3). Effects of hormones and muscle guarding were considered. When
   compared to the KT-2000, the KLA was found to be more precise (+/-0.33
   mm versus +/-61.17 mm) but less reliable (Cronbach's alpha > 0.70 in 0/8

   position is recommended for future design iterations. The KLA shows
   promise as an accurate and reliable tool for measuring in vivo joint and

Abstract = {{An attempt is made to model liquid-liquid two-phase flow inside
   irregular triangular cross-sectional capillaries. In a triangular
   capillary, the distribution of two immiscible liquids is determined by a
   particular threshold pressure, and the interface curvature and profile
   of the meniscus of the two fluids are derived and analyzed. Three
   hundred and sixty cases of steady-state two-phase flow were calculated
   using six triangular shapes, 12 contact angles ranging from 5 to , five
   oil-to-water viscosity ratios from 1.0 to 500, and three different tube
   sizes. The relative permeability curves of oil and water flow in
   different triangular capillaries, with different contact angles and
   oil-to-water viscosity ratio, can be integrated into a pair of curves.
   Moreover, each of these curves reveals an approximately linear relative
   permeability law. The results illustrate that relative permeability is
   independent not only of the size of the capillary, but also of its
   shape, meaning that relative permeability is independent of the geometry
   of the capillary. The results of this study reveal, for the first time,
   that two-phase flow behavior in the triangular cross-sectional
   capillaries is generally independent of the geometric property of the
   capillary. The detailed velocity field of flow, with different
   viscosities, is shown to illustrate the effect of viscosity on the
   velocity distribution. Modeling of the case of thin water films residing
   between the non-wetting phase and the inner wall indicates the presence
   of a lubricating effect of a low-viscosity fluid on a high-viscosity
   fluid at very low water saturation conditions.}},

   carbonation reaction mechanism}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{179}},
Pages = {{531-543}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Most authors consider that gas-solid K2CO3 carbonation occurs
   sequentially, with K2CO3 center dot(1.5 H(2)0) as the intermediate to
   the formation of KHCO3. However, it is demonstrated here that K2CO3
   hydration and carbonation occur in parallel, with no direct conversion
   from K2CO3 center dot(1.5 H(2)0) to KHCO3. The novel results presented
   were obtained by separately tracking the individual uptake quantities of
   CO2 and H2O by K2CO3 derived from four different precursors. The K2CO3
   precursors were subjected to 50 regeneration-carbonation cycles at the
   temperatures of 150 degrees C and 50 degrees C, respectively. In the
   initial cycles, K2CO3 derived from KHCO3 (phase I) showed higher
   reactivity and bicarbonate yield compared to K2CO3 derived from
   previously hydrated samples containing K2CO3 center dot(1.5 H2O) (phase
   II). After sufficient cycling, however, the carbonation performances
   were independent of the K2CO3 precursors and stabilized at similar final
   conversions related to the carbonation conditions. This behavior is
   explained by the stabilization in the constituent phase compositions of
   K2CO3 produced by regeneration. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that
   phase I might be a slightly different monoclinic phase of K2CO3.
   Comparing the kinetic analysis of the observed uptake data with
   qualitative kinetic simulations of possible reaction mechanism scenarios
   revealed that carbonation and hydration of K2CO3 proceed as competing
   reversible reactions in parallel. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   Response to Linear Pitch Changes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOLAR ENERGY ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{A simple unsteady blade element analysis is used to account for the
   effect of the trailing wake on the induced velocity of a wind turbine
   rotor undergoing fast changes in pitch angle. At sufficiently high tip
   speed ratio, the equation describing the thrust of the element reduces
   to a first order, nonlinear Riccti's equation which is solved in a
   closed form for a ramp change in pitch followed by a constant pitch.
   Finite tip speed ratio results in a first order, nonlinear Abel's
   equation. The unsteady aerodynamic forces on the NREL VI wind turbine
   are analyzed at different pitch rates and tip speed ratio, and it is
   found that the overshoot in the forces increases as the tip speed ratio
   and/or the pitch angle increase. The analytical solution of the
   Riccati's equation and numerical solution of Abel's equation gave very
   similar results at high tip speed ratio but the solutions differ as the
   tip speed ratio reduces, partly because the Abel's equation was found to
   magnify the error of assuming linear lift at low tip speed ratio. The
   unsteady tangential induction factor is expressed in the form of first
   order differential equation with the time constant estimated using
   Jowkowsky's vortex model and it was found that it is negligible for
   large tip speed ratio operation.}},

   engineered heart valves (TEHVs). Despite the significant progress in
   recent years in improving the design and performance of TEHV constructs,
   viable and functional human implantable TEHV constructs have remained
   elusive. The recent advances in micro and nanoscale technologies
   including the microfabrication, nano-microfiber based scaffolds

Abstract = {{The fracture behaviour of cemented materials such as rock consisting of
   randomly distributed microcracks is addressed within a coupled physics
   and Hydro-Mechanical (HM) framework. Average-field theory is used to
   formulate a continuum description of such heterogeneous material based
   on observed microscale physical mechanisms in the fully saturated case.
   A representative elementary volume (REV) of the medium is considered
   over which governing field variables for both solid and liquid phases,
   including the underlying constitutive relations, are averaged based on a
   detailed description of the microstructure. Hence, coupled fluid flow
   and deformation mechanisms of an effective homogeneous porous medium can
   be ultimately described based on the micromechanical properties of both
   solid and fluid phases. The presence of heterogeneities in the form of
   distributed microcracks is described using an anisotropic formulation
   and considering a one-way coupled problem wherein fluid pressures impact
   on stress and strain fields, but not vice versa. The macroscopic
   behaviour is then described by relating the relevant macroscale
   quantities together using a suitable homogenization scheme. It is shown
   through various numerical examples that the model captures most of the
   salient underlying physics of HM behaviour of fractured porous medium
   due to the microporomechanical approach adopted in this study. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Several oxidative methods were studied to degrade sulfolane in an
   aqueous medium. These include UVA and UVC irradiation with suitable
   photoactive oxidants, including ozone, H2O2, and TiO2 based photo
   catalysis and their combinations. Since sulfolane lacks absorption bands
   in the UV range beyond 200 nm, initiation of reactions depends on the
   spectra and photochemistry of the oxidants. Among all the advanced
   oxidation processes investigated, combinations of (a) UVC with H2O2 and
   O-3 (b) UVC with H2O2 and (c) UVC with O-3 led to the highest rate of
   sulfolane loss in synthetic water samples. Experiments on sulfolane
   contaminated groundwater samples also indicated that these three
   combinations can efficiently degrade sulfolane. Furthermore, a
   synergistic effect was observed in the combination of H2O2 and O-3
   photolysis. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{The methane storage behavior in nanoporous material is significantly
   different from that of a bulk phase, and has a fundamental role in
   methane extraction from shale and its storage for vehicular
   applications. Here we show that the behavior and mechanisms of the
   methane storage are mainly dominated by the ratio of the interaction
   between methane molecules and nanopores walls to the methane
   intermolecular interaction, and a geometric constraint. By linking the
   macroscopic properties of the methane storage to the microscopic
   properties of a system of methane molecules-nanopores walls, we develop
   an equation of state for methane at supercritical temperature over a
   wide range of pressures. Molecular dynamic simulation data demonstrates
   that this equation is able to relate very well the methane storage
   behavior with each of the key physical parameters, including a pore size
   and shape and wall chemistry and roughness. Moreover, this equation only
   requires one fitted parameter, and is simple, reliable and powerful in
   application.}},

   Part II. CO, HC and NOx}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{565}},
Pages = {{698-705}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{The estimation of emission factors (EFs) is the basis of accurate
   emission inventory. However, the EFs of air pollutants for motor
   vehicles vary under different operating conditions, which will cause
   uncertainty in developing emission inventory. Natural gas (NG),
   considered as a ``cleaner{''} fuel than gasoline, is increasingly being
   used to reduce combustion emissions. However, information is scarce
   about how much emission reduction can be achieved by motor vehicles
   burning NG (NGVs) under real road driving conditions, which is necessary
   for evaluating the environmental benefits for NGVs. Here, online, in
   situ measurements of the emissions from nine bifuel vehicles were
   conducted under different operating conditions on the real road. A
   comparative study was performed for the EFs of black carbon (BC), carbon
   monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) for each
   operating condition when the vehicles using gasoline and compressed NG
   (CNG) as fuel. BC EFs were reported in part I. The part II in this paper
   series reports the influence of operating conditions and fuel types on
   the EFs of CO, HC and NOx. Fuel-based EFs of CO showed good correlations
   with speed when burning CNG and gasoline. The correlation between
   fuel-based HC EFs and speed was relatively weak whether burning CNG or
   gasoline. The fuel-based NOx EFs moderately correlated with speed when
   burning CNG, but weakly correlated with gasoline. As for HC, the
   mileage-based EFs of gasoline vehicles are 2.39-12.59 times higher than
   those of CNG vehicles. The mileage-based NOx EFs of CNG vehicles are
   slightly higher than those of gasoline vehicles. These results would
   facilitate a detailed analysis of the environmental benefits for
   replacing gasoline with CNG in light duty vehicles. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{Physical properties of heavy oil distillation cuts}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{180}},
Pages = {{457-472}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{In order to improve heavy oil characterizations for modeling crude oils
   in refinery processes, an in-house Deep Vacuum Fractionation Apparatus
   (DVFA) was recently modified to provide reproducible extended
   distillation data for heavy oils. In addition, an interconversion method
   was developed to obtain the Normal Boiling Points (NBP) of the
   distillation fractions. In the current contribution, the physical
   properties of the distillation cuts collected using the DVFA (the
   development dataset) are measured and used to evaluate existing
   correlations and develop new correlations to predict normal boiling
   point (NBP), specific gravity (SG), and molecular weight (MW) of heavy
   distillation cuts. The new correlations were also tested on an
   independent test dataset obtained from the literature.
   A modified version of Soreide's correlation was proposed for either NBP
   or MW. The correlation decreased the average absolute relative
   deviations (AARD) of the NBP from 3.0\% to 2.0\%, and of the MW from
   7.8\% to 5.3\% for the development dataset and from 2.5\% to 2.3\% for
   the test dataset. Similar improvements were obtained for the predicted
   MW. A new correlation was proposed to predict SG from the H/C ratio and
   MW, which decreased the AARD from 1.7\% to 0.8\% for the development
   dataset and from 3.1\% to 1.4\% for the test dataset. Of greater
   significance, the new correlations improved the trend in the predicted
   properties toward higher boiling cuts and therefore, are expected to
   provide more accurate estimates of extrapolated properties for heavy
   oils. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{205}},

Month = {{SEP 12}},
Abstract = {{A radial Basis Function Network (RBFN) works well as a nonlinear
   approximator in direct adaptive control, as long as the number of inputs
   is low. A Cerebellar Model Arithmetic Computer (CMAC) indexes basis
   functions efficiently and can handle many inputs, but is prone to
   adaptive-parameter drift and subsequent bursting. This paper proposes
   using overlapping RBFs inside a CMAC structure. Specifically the RBFs
   associated with past and future (predicted) CMAC cells on a CMAC layer
   are activated along with the currently indexed cell's RBF on that layer.
   The novel neural network structure achieves the computational efficiency
   of the CMAC, yet can avoid drift when RBF widths are wide enough.
   Simulation results with a pendulum compare the performance and
   robustness of CMAC, RBF, and the proposed RBFCMAC in both the

Abstract = {{We present preliminary results from a method for estimating the optimal
   effective permittivity for reconstructing microwave-radar images. Using
   knowledge of how microwave-radar images are formed, we identify
   characteristics that are typical of good images, and define a fitness
   function to measure the relative image quality. We build a polynomial
   interpolant of the fitness function in order to identify the most likely
   permittivity values of the tissue. To make the estimation process more
   efficient, the polynomial interpolant is constructed using a locally and
   dimensionally adaptive sampling method that is a novel combination of
   stochastic collocation and polynomial chaos. Examples, using a series of
   simulated, experimental and patient data collected using the Tissue
   Sensing Adaptive Radar system, which is under development at the
   University of Calgary, are presented. These examples show how, using our
   method, accurate images can be reconstructed starting with only a broad
   estimate of the permittivity range.}},

Abstract = {{Roof-top solar photovoltaic systems are normally invisible to system

   a data dimension reduction engine and a mapping function. A number of
   established methods for reducing the dimension of large-scale data is
   investigated, and a hybrid method based on k-means clustering and
   principal component analysis is proposed. The output of this block
   provides a small subset of sites whose measured data are used in the

   estimate the total generation power of all sites based on the measured

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{10-25}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Impedance and efficiency are key characteristics in regard to the
   economic viability of geothermal sites. The influence of hydraulic
   fracturing process on the efficiency of thermal recovery from HDR
   reservoirs is addressed in a totally coupled thermo-poroelastic
   framework. A fracturing model (HFM) is integrated into a domestic
   Fortran 90 finite element code. At any time and any geometrical point,
   the state of fracture is embodied in a fabric: the later includes both
   the actual fracture length and the actual fracture width in all
   directions of space. The local current anisotropic permeability tensor,
   which describes the evolving hydraulic connectivity of the fractured
   medium, is obtained by directional integration of the updated fracture
   fabric. A modified version of the model which accounts for the effect of
   deviatoric stresses on the fracturing criterion is shown to have
   stronger effects on the enhancement of the permeability. To gain
   confidence in the numerical approach, simulations are correlated to
   field data of the Soultz-sous-Forts geothermal site that are available
   in the early times of the injection process. Cooling facilitates
   significantly the fracturing process close to the injection well. The
   model is next applied to simulate a hydraulic fracturing test over a
   long period of time. Hydraulic fracturing is shown to decrease the
   impedance of the reservoir, but it reduces the duration of an efficient
   exploitation. The nature of the mechanical, hydraulic and thermal
   boundary conditions is also investigated. The composition of the working
   fluid and the change of its viscosity with temperature are shown to
   affect fluid and heat transports in the poroelastic medium and hence the
   efficiency of hydraulic fracturing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Over the lastfew decades, research on the abatement of carbon dioxide
   (CO2) gas has gained momentum, due to its increasing atmospheric levels.
   This study investigated thigh-temperature steam only gasification of
   woody biomass for the production of high purity hydrogen integrated with
   CO2 capture in a moving-bed gasifier. Extensive process modelling and
   simulation were performed using the superior solid handling features of
   the Aspen Plus process simulator software. After validating the model
   with experimental data from a demonstration plant available in the open
   literature, a reversible carbonation-calcination reaction of calcium
   oxide (CaO) with CO2 was added to the system. Sensitivity analyses were
   conducted to verify the predictive accuracy of the model. The effects of
   steam-to-carbon (S/C) ratio on the resulting gas composition were
   thoroughly studied to delineate the complex process of gasification.
   Beyond the mitigation of CO2 emissions, the introduction of a CaO-based
   sorbent in the process simulation significantly enhanced hydrogen
   production by simultaneously promoting the forward water-gas shift
   reaction and reducing tars through increased tar cracking reactions. The
   results show that hydrogen of a higher purity was produced with the
   inclusion of dry sorption CO2 capture in the gasification process.
   Moreover, the addition of the sorbent increased the higher heating
   values (HHV) by 3 times and improved the cold gas efficiency by 34 \%.}},

Abstract = {{The early-time performance of multi-fractured horizontal wells is mainly
   controlled by fracture geometry, total effective area of the fractures,
   and conductivity of the primary fracture system. Inverse modeling using
   rate-transient analysis (RTA) methods has historically been used to
   characterize MFHWs at different stages of well life, including the
   early-time performance. In particular, linear flow analysis is used to
   estimate the total effective fracture area from online production data,
   provided that reservoir and fluid properties are known. However, a
   primary complication in analytical linear flow analysis is the
   incorporation of nonlinearities such as multi-phase flow and
   pressure-dependent rock/fluid properties into the calculations.
   A new linear flow analysis technique is presented in the current study,
   which can be applied to tight/shale systems with multi-phase flow and
   pressure-dependent rock/fluid properties. The method combines three
   important reservoir engineering concepts for linear flow analysis:
   dynamic drainage area (DDA), material balance, and decoupling of
   saturation and pressure (which is analogous to the decoupiing of
   geomechanics and fluid flow). The DDA approach has been used previously
   by the authors for history-matching and forecasting using a
   semi-analytical model, but not for inverse modeling (RTA). The DDA
   concept, which uses a time-dependent well productivity index equation
   for the transient flow period, facilitates the incorporation of any sort
   of nonlinearity (including decoupled saturation functions) and
   operational constraints in modeling and RTA of linear flow in MFHWs.
   The method is validated against numerical simulation and applied to
   various sets of field production data from tight/shale gas and oil wells
   with different levels of condensate-(oil-) gas ratio. For all the field
   cases, total effective fracture area obtained from the new analytical
   RTA method is in reasonable agreement with numerical modeling results.
   Regarding accuracy and practicality, the new method represents an
   improvement in RTA of liquid-rich tight/shale reservoirs, particularly
   for cases with multi-phase flow and pressure-dependent rock/fluid
   properties. Further, the concepts used in the new model development are
   easy to understand and implement. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Low Salinity Waterflooding (LSW) is an emerging attractive enhanced oil
   recovery (EOR) method because of its oil recovery performance and
   relatively simple, environmentally friendly implementation, when
   compared with conventional high salinity waterflooding and EOR
   approaches. More importantly, another advantage of LSW is that it can be
   integrated with other EOR methods (in hybrid LSW processes), i.e.
   chemical or miscible gas flooding. The merits of combining LSW with CO2
   injection is investigated in this paper, and a novel EOR method, Low
   Salinity Water Alternating CO2 (CO2 LSWAG), is proposed. CO2 LSWAG
   injection promotes the synergy of the mechanisms underlying these
   methods which further enhances oil recovery and overcomes the late
   production problems frequently encountered in conventional WAG. CO2
   LSWAG has been evaluated in both one-dimensional and full-field scale
   with positive results compared with conventional high salinity WAG.
   To investigate the advantages of CO2 LSWAG, a comprehensive ion exchange
   model associated with geochemical processes has been implemented and
   coupled to the multi-phase multi-component flow equations in an
   equation-of-state compositional simulator. 1D simulation of different
   CO2 LSWAG schemes are first conducted to understand the combined effects
   of solubility of CO2 in brine, dissolution of carbonate minerals, ion
   exchange, and wettability alteration. CO2 LSWAG performance is then
   evaluated on a field scale through an integrated workflow that includes
   geological modeling, multi-phase multi component reservoir flow modeling
   and process optimization. The simulation results indicate that CO2 LSWAG
   has the highest oil recovery compared to conventional high salinity
   waterflood, high salinity WAG, continuous CO2 flooding, and low salinity
   waterflood. A number of geological realizations are generated to assess
   the geological uncertainty effect, in particular clay distribution
   uncertainties, on CO2 LSWAG efficiency. CO2 LSWAG injection strategies
   are optimized by identifying key WAG parameters. Finally, CO2 LSWAG is
   evaluated in the full field scale for a North Sea reservoir and the
   simulation results shows that CO2 LSWAG yields about 4.5\% incremental
   OOIP compared to the conventional high salinity WAG.
   The proposed workflow demonstrates the synergy between CO2 WAG and LSW.
   Built in a robust reservoir simulator, it serves as a powerful tool for
   screening, design, optimization, and uncertainty assessment of the
   process. CO2 LSWAG is a promising EOR technique as it not only combines
   the benefits of CO2 injection and low salinity water floods but also
   promotes the synergy between these processes through the interactions
   between geochemical reactions associated with CO2 injection, ion
   exchange process, and wettability alteration. This paper demonstrates
   the merits of this process through modeling, optimization and
   uncertainty assessment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   shale rock is very tight, hydraulic multi-fracturing in horizontal wells
   has been the key technology in shale gas development. However, it is
   still difficult to connect small-scale pores in the matrix. Meanwhile,
   the recovery rate of a fracturing fluid is low, resulting in severe
   formation damage primarily induced by water blocking or water phase
   trapping. In this work, formation heat treatment is studied for the
   first time in gas-shale to address these issues. Samples from Longmaxi
   Shale are used to investigate the change in the multiscale gas transport
   ability after a high temperature treatment. A core sample heating system
   is specially designed to measure a permeability change during a high
   temperature treatment. Field scanning electron microscopy imaging, total
   organic carbon and low pressure nitrogen adsorption measurements are
   also implemented to analyze a change in the micro structure after the
   high temperature treatment. The results indicate that shale permeability
   increases rapidly with an increase in temperature, especially when the
   temperature is more than 400-500 degrees C, which can be described as a
   threshold value in a percolation model. Experimental results also
   indicate that the quality of the shale matrix can be dramatically
   improved after a high temperature treatment since there is a high quartz
   and organic matter content in the shale. Stimulation mechanisms of a
   formation heat treatment in shale gas reservoirs are described as water
   removing, mineral and organic matter structure changes and multiscale
   fracture network generation. For the field application of formation heat
   treatment, both its advantages and issues that still need to be
   addressed are deeply analyzed. It is indicated that the mid-late period
   of shale gas production can be extended, and problems induced by a
   residual fracturing fluid can be solved by formation heat treatment.
   Constructive field operation suggestions, which combine the advantages
   of electrical heating and microwave heating, are presented. (C) 2016

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{A}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The conductivity of sand-packed fractures is influenced by the fracture
   width and permeability. Prop pants become rearranged, embedded in
   formations and even deformed under certain pressures. Thus, the fracture
   width, the porosity and the radius of seepage channels decrease with
   increasing pressure. Currently, sand-packed fracture conductivity is
   measured in the laboratory but rarely calculated by mathematical methods
   or based on ideal conditions, which may not always be true in practice.
   This paper demonstrates proppant rearrangement under low and high
   pressure and presents a rhombohedron model to calculate sand-packed
   fracture conductivity that considers the looseness coefficient,
   deformations of rock and proppants, particle size, crushing rate, number
   of proppant layers, closure pressure and so on. The mathematical model
   is based on the principle of elastic-plastic sphere contacts, the
   capillary bundle model and the Carman-Kozeny equation. In this case, the
   changing width and permeability of sand-packed fractures during
   compression can be calculated. Verification experiments and comparisons
   with existing models indicate that the mathematical models can
   reasonably predict the sand-packed fracture width and conductivity under
   real conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Current imaging diagnosis of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) in
   infancy relies on 2-D ultrasound (US), which is highly
   operator-dependent. 3-D US offers more complete, and potentially more
   reliable, imaging of infant hip geometry. We sought to validate the
   fidelity of acetabular surface models obtained by 3-D US against those
   obtained concurrently by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 3-D US and
   MRI scans were performed on the same d in 20 infants with normal to
   severely dysplastic hips (mean age, 57 d; range 13-181 d). 3-D US was
   performed by two observers using a Philips VL13-5 probe. Coronal 3-D
   multi-echo data image combination (MEDIC) magnetic resonance (MR) images
   (1-mm slice thickness) were obtained, usually without sedation, in a 1.5
   T Siemens unit. Acetabular surface models were generated for 40 hips
   from 3-D US and MRI using semi-automated tracing software, separately by
   three observers. For each hip, the 3-D US and MRI models were
   co-registered to overlap as closely as possible using Amira software,
   and the root mean square (RMS) distances between points on the models
   were computed. 3-D US scans took 3.2 s each. Inter-modality variability
   was visually minimal. Mean RMS distance between corresponding points on
   the acetabular surface at 3-D US and MRI was 0.4 +/- 0.3 mm, with 95\%
   confidence interval <1 mm. Mean RMS errors for inter-observer and
   intra-observer comparisons were significantly less for 3-D US than for
   MRI, while inter-scan and inter-modality comparisons showed no
   significant difference. Acetabular geometry was reproduced by 3-D US
   surface models within 1 mm of the corresponding 3-D MRI surface model,
   and the 3-D US models were more reliable. This validates the fidelity of
   3-D US modeling and encourages future use of 3-D US in assessing infant
   acetabulum anatomy, which may be useful to detect and monitor treatment
   of hip dysplasia. (C) 2016 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine

Abstract = {{A coordinated design of power system stabilizer and power oscillation
   damping controller for generator and STATCOM voltage regulators is
   presented. Because fuzzy logic has the potential to overcome the
   inherent limitations of conventional and analytical model-based design
   approaches, simple fuzzy logic controllers operating as power system
   stabilizer and power oscillation damping controller are used in this
   work to enhance power system stability. The coordinated design of these
   fuzzy supplementary controllers (FSCs) is formulated as a constrained
   optimization problem with a time-domain based cost function. The optimal
   set of controller parameters is determined by applying a simultaneous
   tuning approach based on bat algorithm optimization. Simulations of a
   two-area power system under several operating conditions and
   perturbations are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the
   proposed alternative in damping system oscillations. Performance of the
   proposed coordinated FSCs is compared with other coordinated and
   uncoordinated design approaches, including coordinated FSCs using
   genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization. Copyright (C) 2016

Title = {{Semi-analytical model for matching flowback and early-time production of
   multi-fractured horizontal tight oil wells}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF UNCONVENTIONAL OIL AND GAS RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},
Pages = {{134-145}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Analysis of multi-fractured horizontal well (MFHW) production data
   completed in low-permeability (tight) oil reservoirs has traditionally
   focused on long-term (online) production after the initial flowback
   period. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that important
   information about hydraulic fractures can be ascertained from flowback
   data and simulation studies are now being designed to model flowback
   along with the online production.
   In this work, a new semi-analytical model is developed specifically for
   modeling water and hydrocarbon production during flowback and early-time
   production for tight oil wells. Two flow regions are assumed: a primary
   hydraulic fracture (PHF) and an enhanced fracture region (EFR) adjacent
   to the hydraulic fracture, where reservoir permeability has been
   enhanced due to stimulation. Alternatively, a non-stimulated matrix
   region (NSR), where reservoir permeability is not enhanced due to
   stimulation, may be placed adjacent to the PHF. A coupled PHF-EFR model
   is created by assigning the average pressure in the PHF as the inner
   boundary condition of the EFR, and wellbore flowing pressure as the
   inner boundary-condition for PHF. If the initial fracture pressure is
   greater than reservoir pressure, the coupled model forecasts initial
   production to be single-phase flow of fracturing fluid, followed by
   two-phase flow of fracturing fluid and formation oil from the EFR to the
   PHF after breakthrough to the fracture. Transient flow of fluids through
   the PHF and EFR is modeled with the dynamic drainage area approach.
   Equations of coupled flow/material balance are solved iteratively at
   each timestep. Stress-dependent properties of fractures and matrix are
   handled in the solution.
   The robustness of this innovative approach is tested through comparison
   with more rigorous numerical simulation, and its practicality
   demonstrated with a field example. The new technique should serve as a
   useful tool for petroleum engineers responsible for forecasting tight
   oil wells exhibiting these complexities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

   good vs poor patients after total hip arthroplasty and to report on our
   preliminary experiences (17 good, 18 poor).
   Results: All revision cases were found to have at least 4 high or low
   implant or anatomic parameters relative to the good group. These
   included acetabular cup orientation, sagittal pelvic tilt, sacral slope,
   femoral offset, and neckeshaft angle. Acetabular cup orientation
   differed significantly between groups.
   Conclusion: With the EOS system, a large cohort can be studied
   relatively quickly and at low dose, which could lead to patient-specific

Abstract = {{With the advent of three dimensional (3D) IC designs, new partitioning
   techniques that can take into account the 3D nature of designs are
   required. In this paper, a new force-directed simulated annealing (FSA)
   is introduced and used for 3D partitioning. The proposed force-directed
   simulated annealing introduces force as a new factor during the
   annealing process and replaces the random moves by probabilistic
   force-directed moves. Experimental results show that the force-directed
   move strategy speeds up the convergence and significantly improves the
   execution time of SA maintaining the quality of solution. FSA algorithm
   is effective for 3D IC partitioning and can be applied in other
   optimization problems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The porous nature of the electrode material in supercapacitors and the
   apparent conductivity of the electrolyte cause their impedance to show a
   complex frequency-dependent behavior, which in turn makes it incorrect
   to treat them as ideal capacitors, even at a frequency of a few
   millihertz. This is particularly crucial if the intended application
   requires a configuration that uses stacked supercapacitor banks, in
   which errors in defining the metrics of the individual components
   accumulate. Although manufacturers provide supercapacitor ratings under
   DC only, by using a detailed impedance spectroscopy study of all
   possible series and parallel combinations of two different commercial
   1Farad carbon-carbon supercapacitors, we show that these nominal DC
   capacitances are not suitable to evaluate the equivalent capacitance.
   Instead, by using a model that consists of a series resistance and a
   constant-phase element, we employed a real, effective capacitance (in
   proper Farad units) suitable for direct application. This effective
   capacitance can be used to define the frequency-dependent quality factor
   of a supercapacitor and enables the easy calculation of series and
   parallel associations of identical or different devices.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This study proposes fully-automated methods for as-built model
   generation of subway tunnels employing mobile Light Detection and
   Ranging (LiDAR) data. The employed dataset is acquired by a Velodyne HDL
   32E and covers 155 m of a subway tunnel containing six million points.
   First, the tunnel's main axis and cross sections are extracted. Next, a
   preliminary model is created by fitting an ellipse to each extracted
   cross section. The model is refined by employing residual analysis and
   Baarda's data snooping method to eliminate outliers. The final model is
   then generated by applying least squares adjustment to outlier-free
   data. The obtained results indicate that the tunnel's main axis and 1551
   cross sections at 0.1 m intervals are successfully extracted. Cross
   sections have an average semi-major axis of 7.8508 m with a standard
   deviation of 0.2 mm and semi-minor axis of 7.7509 m with a standard
   deviation of 0.1 mm. The average normal distance of points from the
   constructed model (average absolute error) is also 0.012 m. The
   developed algorithm is applicable to tunnels with any horizontal
   orientation and degree of curvature since it makes no assumptions, nor
   does it use any a priori knowledge regarding the tunnel's curvature and
   horizontal orientation.}},

Volume = {{30}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Electrical heating of oil sand formations involves high temperatures,
   which can lead to in-situ gas generation as a result of aquathermolysis
   and thermal cracking of bitumen. The thermal cracking of bitumen can
   also lead to formation of coke at higher temperatures. Prediction of the
   volume of the produced gas and coke is very important in design and
   implementation of thermal processes dealing with high temperatures such
   as electrical heating and steam assisted gravity drainage with addition
   of oxygen. In this work a reaction kinetics model has been developed
   based on the experimental data of in-situ gas generation from an
   Athabasca bitumen sample. The kinetic parameters were estimated using
   the experimental data in the temperature range 360-420 degrees C. The
   results show that coke formation can be significant at higher
   temperatures. An important observation was that a plateau to H2S
   production is not expected at higher temperatures. In addition, the
   results show that operation at 370 degrees C produces a gaseous
   composition that minimizes the volume of the produced gas at the
   surface. A simple scaling analysis is presented that allows
   clarification of the scatter that has been observed in the reported
   produced hydrogen sulfide versus the operation temperature. The
   developed model provides a useful tool for the estimation of produced
   gas composition during thermal recovery processes.}},

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{This work summarizes the results of multiple experiments performed in
   the LUKOIL Neftohim Burgas Research Laboratory related to the issue of
   high values of hot filtration test (HFT) of the residue H-Oil
   hydrocracking residual oil products. After the start-up of the new
   residue H-Oil hydrocracker in the LUKOIL Neftohim Burgas refinery during
   the second half of 2015 the values of the HFT of the vacuum tower bottom
   product varied between 0.01 and 8.7\%. It was found that the vacuum
   residual oil feed source has a profound effect on the processes of
   sedimentation in the H-Oil hydrocracker. The processing of vacuum
   residual oils from Arab medium, Arab heavy, and Basrah light crudes
   reduced the sedimentation and allowed achievement of a higher
   conversion. The H/C ratios of asphaltenes from all studied feeds
   decreased after hydrocracking. However, the decrease of the H/C ratio
   was the least pronounced with the Basra light asphaltenes, while the H/C
   ratios of asphaltenes from the vacuum residual oils originating from the
   crudes Urals and El Bouri became much lower. The maltene fraction H/C
   ratio could become lower, the same, or higher after hydrocracking
   depending on the feed source, catalyst metal (vanadium) loading, or the
   hydrocracking unit (commercial, pilot plant, or laboratory unit). It was
   found that after addition of high aromatic fluid catalytic cracking gas
   oils the H-Oil residue HFT dropped and the dependence of the residue HFT
   on the concentration of FCC gas oils in the blend could be approximated
   by a third order polynomial. Correlations were developed to predict the
   H-Oil based residual fuel oil HFT from information on the base H-Oil
   residue HFT and the amount of added fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) gas
   oil. The treatment of the H-Oil residual oils with commercial HFT
   reducers may decrease the residual oil HFT. However, the efficiency in
   HFT reduction turned out to depend on the nature of the H-Oil residue
   and on the concentration range of the HFT reducing additive. From all
   studied additives solely the dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA) was
   capable of reducing the H-Oil residual oil below 0.1\%. However, the
   treatment rate of the DBSA was an order higher than that of the
   commercial additives A, B, and C. DBSA was an order of magnitude more
   effective in the reduction of the total sediment existent, and the total
   sediment potential than the FCC HCO.}},

Title = {{Effects of Chemical Additives on Dynamic Capillary Pressure during
   Waterflooding in Low Permeability Reservoirs}},
Journal = {{ENERGY \& FUELS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{7082-7093}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{It is suggested that the capillary pressure-fluid saturation
   relationship should be determined as a function of a dynamic coefficient
   (tau) and the time derivative of fluid saturation (partial derivative
   S-w/partial derivative t), indicating a dynamic capillary pressure in
   most cases, which will increase the flowing resistance and injection
   pressure for oil-wet reservoirs, especially in low permeability
   formations. To decrease the injection pressure and improve injection,
   various chemical additives such as surfactants and fluorides have been
   widely used in the waterflooding process in low permeability reservoirs.
   Effects and mechanisms of these chemical additives are yet not
   well-known. In this paper, a series of specially designed waterflooding
   experiments were conducted to investigate the effects and mechanisms of
   surfactant additives on the dynamic capillary pressure-fluid saturation
   relationship in low permeability reservoirs. In the experiment,
   capillary pressure-fluid saturation relationships in three low
   permeability core samples were examined during the waterflooding
   process, as well as the surfactant added waterflooding process. Then,
   local dynamic coefficients in the core samples were calculated and
   compared. Results indicate that low permeability reservoirs present a
   high dynamic coefficient, therefore generating high dynamic capillary
   pressure, which is the cause of high injection pressure during
   waterflooding. Furthermore, surfactant additives can reduce the dynamic
   coefficient and capillary pressure significantly, and the lower
   permeability core sample shows higher dynamic capillary pressure
   reduction, indicating that surfactant added waterflooding can
   significantly reduce injection pressure in low permeability reservoirs.
   This work provides a method to investigate the interaction among fluids
   and porous media during waterflooding through the examination of dynamic
   capillarity.}},

Abstract = {{A methodology has been developed to predict the viscosity of crude oils
   and their fractions from a distillation based oil characterization. The
   maltenes were characterized as a set of pseudo-components with
   properties determined from established generalized correlations. The
   asphaltene fraction was characterized as a single component and its
   properties were measured. The viscosities of the pseudo-components,
   asphaltenes, whole oils, and their fractions were determined with the
   Expanded Fluid (EF) viscosity model. The inputs for the model are the
   pressure, the density of the fluid at a given pressure and temperature,
   the dilute gas viscosity calculated from established generalized
   correlations, and three fluid-specific parameters: c(2), rho(s)degrees,
   and c(3). Densities were calculated using the modified Rackett
   correlation with the Tait-COSTALD compressibility correction. The c3
   parameter was determined from a previously developed correlation. New
   correlations were developed for the c(2) and rho(s)degrees parameters of
   the maltene pseudo-components, as a function of their boiling point and
   specific gravity. The parameters for the asphaltene fraction were
   estimated based on the measured viscosity of molten asphaltenes. The EF
   parameters for the whole oil, or any oil fraction, were determined with
   mass-based mixing rules and binary interaction parameters, calculated
   from a previously developed correlation. To develop and test the
   proposed approach, density and viscosity data were collected for 40
   distillation cuts from 6 oils, 7 maltenes, 2 asphaltenes, 3 partially
   deasphalted oils, and 14 dead oils. Using this model to predict crude
   oil viscosity under any conditions requires the distillation assay data,
   the asphaltene mass content, and the specific gravity and molecular
   weight of the oil. The approach was tested on a development and test
   dataset of 4 crude oils (this study) and an independent test dataset of
   4 oils from the literature with overall average absolute relative
   deviation (AARD) values of 41\% and 43\%, respectively. Single
   multiplier tuning of the c(2) parameter to one viscosity data point
   halved the error. Tuning both the c(2) and rho(s)degrees parameters
   using two viscosity data points reduced the AARD to <8\% in both cases.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new accurate small-and large-signal
   equivalent-circuit-based modeling technique for gallium nitride (GaN)
   HEMT transistors grown on silicon substrate is presented. Despite
   X-parameters are developed as tools for the development of black-box
   modeling, they are used for equivalent-circuit-based model extraction.
   Unlike traditional modeling that uses the small-signal data to build
   with an indirect manner a nonlinear model, the proposed model is
   extracted from X-parameter measurements directly. However, similar to
   the equivalent-circuit-based models discussed in the literature, the new
   model is subdivided into extrinsic and intrinsic parts. The extrinsic
   part consists of linear elements and is related to the physical layout
   of the transistor. The intrinsic part can be extracted with the proposed
   analytical de-embedding technique. The nonlinear intrinsic elements are
   represented by new nonlinear lumped impedances and admittances whose
   extraction is carried out using a newly proposed technique. This new
   technique uses nonlinear network parameters, various X-parameter
   conversion rules, and basic analysis techniques of interconnected
   nonlinear networks. It is accurate and more advantageous than
   traditional transistor modeling techniques. The modeling procedure was
   applied to a 10 mu m x 200 mu m GaN HEMT with a gate length of 0.25 mu
   m. A very good accordance between model simulations and measurements was
   obtained, validating the modeling approach.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an apparatus capable of measuring the average

   between which the breast is placed. Each array is fitted with five
   ultra-wideband (UWB) sensors operating from 1.5 to 10 GHz. Direct
   contact is made between the breast skin and the sensor arrays, avoiding
   any matching liquid. The transmission coefficients for all possible
   sensor pairs in the two arrays are measured in 15 s. The data are then
   transformed to the time domain, and a time delay spectroscopy technique
   is used to estimate permittivity. The system was tested using phantoms
   with known properties and showed accurate estimations. Tests on human
   subjects resulted in dielectric property estimates in line with
   published data, while variation between scans of the same volunteer is
   as small as 2\%.}},

Abstract = {{Encapsulating drugs in nanoparticles (NPs) provide some advantages over
   free drugs; for example the probability of distribution in off-target
   tissues decreases and drugs remain safe from environment degrading
   factors. Upon entering the bioenvironment, NPs establish a number of
   interactions with their surroundings based on their physicochemical
   properties. Here we demonstrate how the size-surface charge interplay of
   chitosan NPs affects the protein corona formation and endocytosis
   pathway in the HeLa cells at non-toxic concentrations. Generally, large
   NPs (102 and 161 nm) with low surface charge (+6.7 and +3.6 mV)
   exhibited weaker tendency for endocytosis compared with smaller ones (63
   and 83 nm with 10 and 9.3 mV surface charge, respectively). This is
   mainly because the interactions of larger NPs with the plasma membrane
   were too weak to release enough free energy required for cellular
   internalization. Furthermore, we tested the upright and inverted cell
   culture configurations to better understand the impact of the
   sedimentation and diffusion velocities of NPs on the resulting cellular
   uptake pattern in both serum free and serum containing culture medias.
   Considering the different particokinetics, the amount of internalized
   NPs in upright and inverted positions differed in all cases by a factor
   of approximately three (for 161 nm particles), or less for smaller ones.
   Ultimately, our results offer a paradigm for analyzing the biobehavior
   of NPs under the precise control of their physicochemical
   characteristics. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a new algorithm to simulate single- and two-phase viscous
   flow through a three-dimensional Cartesian representation of the porous
   space, such as those available through X-ray microtomography. We use the
   finite difference method to discretize the governing equations and also
   propose a new method to enforce the incompressible flow constraint under
   zero Neumann boundary conditions for the velocity components. Finite
   difference formulation leads to fast parallel implementation through
   linear solvers for sparse matrices, allowing relatively fast
   simulations, while regularization techniques used on solving inverse
   problems lead to the desired incompressible fluid flow.
   Tests performed using benchmark samples show good agreement with
   experimental/theoretical values. Additional tests are run on Bentheimer
   and Buff Berea sandstone samples with available laboratory measurements.
   We compare the results from our new method, based on finite differences,
   with an open source finite volume implementation as well as experimental
   results, specifically to evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of each
   method. Finally, we calculate relative permeability by using this
   modified finite difference technique together with a level set based
   algorithm for multi-phase fluid distribution in the pore space. To our
   knowledge this is the first time regularization techniques are used in
   combination with finite difference fluid flow simulations. (C) 2016

   employed to study the effect of pore structure and geometries on the
   relationships of formation factor-permeability and permeability-porosity
   on physically realistic 3D random networks. These relationships are
   derived by constructing two sets of physically equivalent pore networks
   of tight porous media and are validated using experimental measurements
   of Mesaverde tight gas sandstones. The first set of networks were based
   on Berea sand network properties, which are then reduced and derived
   using a Weibull truncated equation to produce physically sound tight
   porous media. The second equivalent networks are constructed according
   to experimentally derived throat size distributions obtained from
   ambient mercury injection capillary pressure for 17 selected core
   samples from three Mesaverde tight gas sandstones basins in the U.S.
   Imperial college Pore-Scale Modeling software is used to model the
   single liquid flow properties through constructed equivalent networks.
   The estimated porosity, absolute liquid permeability and formation
   factor of the constructed physically equivalent networks are in good
   agreement with measured data obtained by Byrnes et al. (Analysis of
   critical permeability, capillary and electrical properties for Mesaverde
   tight gas sandstones from Western US basins: final scientific. Technical
   report submitted to DOE and NETL 355, 2009). However, a variation
   between estimated absolute permeability to liquid and measured routine
   gas permeability is accounted in core samples that have measured
   permeability smaller than 0.1 mD. Networks based on Berea sand
   properties show qualitative agreement between modeled data points and
   experiment data. However, modeled data are off by two orders of
   magnitude and all fall more or less on the same line.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the thermal conductivity of nanocomposites of
   carbon nanotubes (CNT) and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) polymer
   composites using a three-dimensional random walk algorithm and effective
   medium approach (EMA) method. For CNT nanocomposites, the influence of
   the orientation of CNTs (semi-aligned and randomly-dispersed) on the
   thermal conductivity was quantified. For hBN nanocomposites, thermal
   conductivity values were studied in random dispersion of inclusions.
   Hybrid nanocomposites containing both hBN and CNT were also investigated
   using a random walk method and experiments. To verify the calculated
   thermal conductivities, nanocomposite samples were fabricated. Both the
   modeling and experimental results showed that the concentration of
   nanoparticulates (random dispersion) in composites increases thermal
   conductivity up to 170\% and 300\% for 13.1 vol\% CNT and 6.3 vol\% hBN,
   respectively. It was found that the alignment of CNTs may enhance
   thermal conductivity of CNT composites. For composites with a 13.1 vol\%
   of CNTs, the increase in thermal conductivity of the semi-aligned
   composites is approximately 210\%. However, for hybrid composites with a
   3.1 vol\% of CNT/hBN (1.55 vol\% each), a 290\% increase is observed. At
   3.1 vol\%, thermal conductivity enhancements are 170\% and 250\% for
   single-filled composites of CNT and hBN, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   characterization. The fabricated prototype uses a GaN HEMT from Cree
   Inc. and exhibits a drain efficiency of 53\%-64\% in the range of
   0.7-4.0 GHz while having an output power of 37.5-39.1 dBm corresponding

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{This study focused on the effects of simulated microgravity (s-mu g) on
   mechanical properties, major cytoskeleton biopolymers, and morphology of
   endothelial cells (ECs). The structural and functional integrity of ECs
   are vital to regulate vascular homeostasis and prevent atherosclerosis.
   Furthermore, these highly gravity sensitive cells play a key role in
   pathogenesis of many diseases. In this research, impacts of s-mu g on
   mechanical behavior of human umbilical vein endothelial cells were
   investigated by utilizing a three-dimensional random positioning machine
   (3D-RPM). Results revealed a considerable drop in cell stiffness and
   viscosity after 24 hrs of being subjected to weightlessness. Cortical
   rigidity experienced relatively immediate and significant decline
   comparing to the stiffness of whole cell body. The cells became rounded
   in morphology while western blot analysis showed reduction of the main
   cytoskeletal components. Moreover, fluorescence staining confirmed
   disorganization of both actin filaments and microtubules (MTs). The
   results were compared statistically among test and control groups and it
   was concluded that s-mu g led to a significant alteration in mechanical
   behavior of ECs due to remodeling of cell cytoskeleton.}},

Journal = {{SPANISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This study aimed to develop a remote sensing-based method for
   forecasting rice yield by considering vegetation greenness conditions
   during initial and peak greenness stages of the crop; and implemented
   for ``boro{''} rice in Bangladeshi context. In this research, we used
   Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived two 16-day
   composite of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images at 250
   m spatial resolution acquired during the initial (January 1 to January
   16) and peak greenness (March 23/24 to April 6/7 depending on leap year)
   stages in conjunction with secondary datasets (i.e., boro suitability
   map, and ground-based information) during 2007-2012 period. The method
   consisted of two components: (i) developing a model for delineating area
   under rice cultivation before harvesting; and (ii) forecasting rice
   yield as a function of NDVI. Our results demonstrated strong agreements
   between the model (i.e., MODIS-based) and ground-based area estimates
   during 2010-2012 period, i.e., coefficient of determination (R-2); root
   mean square error (RMSE); and relative error (RE) in between 0.93 to
   0.95; 30,519 to 37,451 ha; and +/- 10\% respectively at the 23
   district-levels. We also found good agreements between forecasted (i.e.,
   MODIS-based) and ground-based yields during 2010-2012 period (R2 between
   0.76 and 0.86; RMSE between 0.21 and 0.29 Mton/ha, and RE between
   -5.45\% and 6.65\%) at the 23 district-levels. We believe that our
   developments of forecasting the boro rice yield would be useful for the
   decision makers in addressing food security in Bangladesh.}},

Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Porous asphalt (PA), porous concrete (PC), and permeable inter-locking
   pavers (PICP) with subsurface layers consisting of different gravel
   sizes (63, 40, and 12 mm) commonly used in the bedding, base, and
   sub-base layers of permeable pavements were investigated for their
   ability to remove total suspended solids (TSS), total phosphorous (TP),
   and total nitrogen (TN). The investigation focused on the individual
   surface and sub-surface layers of the three permeable pavements to
   ``treat{''} these pollutants and how the physical design of these layers
   influences their water quality treatment performance. This assessment
   was conducted with a laboratory study, but performances were also
   compared to data obtained from a field-scale study of pollutant removal
   in PA, PC, and PICP. Pollutant removal by a sub-surface layer and the
   particle size distribution of outflow are dependent on both the
   thickness of the layer and the gravel size. Superior performance in
   removing pollutants was found in PC's surface layer compared to the
   surface layers of PA and PICP. The lab-scale pavements and the
   field-scale pavements have similar performance in removing pollutants
   for TSS (87-95 \%) and TP (75-89 \%) but not for TN (310 \% for
   lab-scale and 2-40 \% for field-scale pavements). A simple mathematical
   model based on these results was developed to provide estimates of
   performance in the field.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present six subspace decomposition based methods for
   joint time of arrival (TOA) and frequency of arrival (FOA) estimation of
   multiple incident sources. These are LU-TLS, QR-TLS, direct TSQR-TLS,
   direct TSLU-TLS, parallel TSQR-TLS, and parallel TSLU-TLS. The direct
   and parallel TSQR/TSLU-TLS are recently developed methods in subspace
   decomposition and are employed in this work for time and frequency
   estimation. The proposed methods employ a pair of spatially separated
   sensors to receive multiple incident source signals. A data matrix is
   constructed in the form of a Hankel matrix from multiple snapshots of
   the received signal. The information of both TOA and FOA of multiple
   incident sources is extracted from the data matrix by applying LU/QR
   techniques (in the first set of the methods) and a tall skinny TSLU/TSQR
   factorization in the second set. The estimates of the TOA and FOA are
   obtained from the signal subspace by applying the total least squares
   (TLS) method. Simulation results are presented to assess the performance
   of the proposed methods. The effect of parametric variations on the
   performance has also been analyzed for all the proposed methods.
   Further, the computational times and complexities of the proposed
   methods are also computed and compared with each other.}},

Abstract = {{Adding an exit diffuser is known to allow wind turbines to exceed the
   classical Betz-Joukowsky limit for a bare turbine. It is not clear,
   however, if there is a limit for diffuser-augmented turbines or whether
   the structural and other costs of the diffuser outweigh any gain in
   power. This work presents anew approach to the aerodynamic optimization
   of a wind turbine with a diffuser. It is based on an extension of the
   well-known Blade Element Theory and a simple model for diffuser
   efficiency. It is assumed that the same conditions for the axial
   velocity in the wake of an ordinary wind turbine can be applied on the
   flow far downwind of the diffuser outlet. An algorithm to optimize the
   blade chord and twist angle distributions in the presence of a diffuser
   was developed and implemented. As a result, an aerodynamic improvement
   of the turbine rotor geometry was achieved with the blade shape
   sensitive to the diffuser speed-up ratio. In order to evaluate the
   proposed approach, a comparison with the classical Glauert optimization
   was performed for a flanged diffuser, which increased the efficiency. In
   addition, a comparative assessment was made with experimental results
   available in the literature, suggesting better performance for the rotor
   designed with the proposed optimization procedure. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the efficacy of using a combined biofilm-biochar
   approach to remove organic ( naphthenic acids ( NAs)) and inorganic (
   metals) contaminants from process water ( OSPW) generated by Canada's
   oil sands mining operations. A microbial community sourced from an OSPW
   sample was cultured as biofilms on several carbonaceous materials. Two
   biochar samples, from softwood bark ( SB) and Aspen wood ( N3),
   facilitated the most microbial growth ( measured by protein assays) and
   were used for NA removal studies performed with and without biofilms,
   and in the presence and absence of contaminating metals. Similar NA
   removal was seen in 6-day sterile N3 and SB assays (>30\%), while
   biodegradation by SB-associated biofilms increased NA removal to 87\% in
   the presence of metals. Metal sorption was also observed, with up to
   four times more immobilization of Fe, Al, and As on biofilm-associated
   biochar. These results suggest this combined approach may be a promising
   treatment for OSPW. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (N-CNT)/polymer
   nanocomposites exhibiting relatively high and frequency independent real
   permittivity (epsilon') together with low dielectric loss (tan delta).
   N-CNTs were synthesized by chemical vapor deposition, and their
   nanocomposites were prepared by melt-mixing with polyvinylidene fluoride
   (PVDF). In the synthesis of N-CNTs, three catalysts of Co, Fe and Ni,
   and three temperatures of 650, 750 and 950 degrees C were employed. The
   morphology, aspect ratio, synthesis yield, remaining residue, nitrogen
   content, nitrogen bonding type, and powder conductivity of N-CNTs, and
   the morphology, polar crystalline phase, and broadband dielectric
   properties of N-CNT/PVDF nanocomposites were investigated. The results
   revealed that by proper selection of synthesis catalyst (Fe) and
   temperature (650 degrees C and 950 degrees C), nitrogen doping generated
   polarizable nanotubes via providing local polarization sites, and
   resulted in nanocomposites with favorable dielectric properties for
   charge storage applications at N-CNT loadings as low as 1.0 wt\%. As a
   result, 3.5 wt\% (N-CNT)(Fe/950 degrees) (C)/PVDF nanocomposites
   exhibited an insulative behavior with epsilon' = 23.12 and tan delta =
   0.05 at 1 kHz, a combination superior to that of PVDF, i.e., epsilon' =
   8.4 and tan delta = 0.03 and to those of percolative nanocomposites,
   e.g., epsilon' = 71.20 and tan delta = 63.20 for 3.5 wt\% (N-CNT)(Fe/750
   degrees C)/PVDF. Also, the relationships between the dielectric
   properties, N-CNT structure, and nanocomposite morphology were

Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{269-276}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The usual method to account for a finite number of blades in blade
   element calculations of wind turbine performance is through a tip loss
   factor. Most analyses use the tip loss approximation due to Prandtl
   which is easily and cheaply calculated but is known to be inaccurate at
   low tip speed ratio. We develop three methods for the direct calculation
   of the tip loss. The first is the computationally expensive calculation
   of the velocities induced by the helicoidal wake which requires the
   evaluation of infinite sums of products of Bessel functions. The second
   uses the asymptotic evaluation of those sums by Kawada. The third uses
   the approximation due to Okulov which avoids the sums altogether. These
   methods are compared to the tip loss determined independently and
   exactly for an ideal three-bladed rotor at tip speed ratios between zero
   and 15. Kawada's asymptotic approximation and Okulov's equations are
   preferable to the Prandtl factor at all tip speed ratios, with the
   Okulov equations being generally more accurate. In particular the tip
   loss factor exceeds unity near the axis of rotation by a large amount at
   all tip speed ratios, which Prandtl's factor cannot reproduce. Neither
   the Kawada nor the Okulov equations impose a large computational burden
   on a blade element program. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In order to include viscous instability in modeling heavy oil
   waterflooding, it is essential to predict the nature of viscous
   instability. It is still unclear as to whether previous findings of
   viscous fingering in immiscible displacements in the presence of high
   single-phase permeabilities and linear displacement schemes are valid in
   displacement schemes similar to oil-field patterns (e.g., five-spot) and
   what the effect of dispersion (caused by varying velocity profiles) is
   on viscous fingering. To overcome the limitations of previous studies of
   viscous fingering in immiscible displacements, we conduct experiments in
   low-permeability, one-quarter five-spot patterns. The correlation of
   experimentally measured oil recoveries, pressure drops, saturation
   profiles, viscous fingers length and width, dynamic population of
   fingers, and rate of growth of fingers population with time and front

Abstract = {{We developed a simple method to prepare hybrid copper-silver conductive
   tracks under flash light sintering. The developed metal
   nanoparticle-based ink is convenient because its preparation process is,
   free of any tedious washing steps. The inks were composed of
   commercially available copper nanoparticles which were mixed with formic
   acid, silver nitrate, and diethylene glycol. The role of formic acid is
   to remove the native copper oxide layer on the surface of the copper
   nanoparticles. In this way, it facilitates the formation of a silver
   outer shell on the surface of the copper nanoparticles through a
   galvanic replacement. In the presence of formic acid, the copper
   nanoparticles formed copper formate, which was present in the unsintered
   tracks. However, under illumination by a xenon flash light, the copper
   formate was then converted to copper. Moreover, the resistance of the
   copper-only films increased by 6 orders of magnitude when oxidized at
   high temperatures (similar to 220 degrees C). However, addition of
   silver nitrate to the inks suppressed the oxidation of the hybrid
   copper-silver films, and the resistance changes in these inks at high
   temperatures were greatly reduced. In addition, the hybrid inks proved
   to be advantageous for use in electrical circuits as they demonstrated a
   stable electrical conductivity after exposure to ambient air at 180
   degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{Enhancing heat transfer in thermal fluid systems can contribute
   significantly towards the improvement of thermal efficiency resulting in
   reducing energy consumption and hence carbon emission. Conventional
   fluids like water and oil have limited heat transfer potential. The need
   for the development of new classes of fluids with enhanced heat transfer
   properties is thus becoming essential. Many studies have developed
   nanofluids using nanoparticles, however, they showed a limited
   enhancement in heat transfer. This study investigated the heat capacity,
   enhancement of heat transfer, viscosity, and pressure drop of nanofluids
   with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and CNTs doped with iron oxide
   nanoparticles (Fe2O3-CNT). The surfaces of carbon nanotubes were doped
   with 1 wt.\% and 10.0 wt.\% iron oxide nanoparticles. The pristine and
   doped CNTs were used to prepare heat-exchange nanofluids with additive
   concentrations of 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10 wt.\%. A shell and tube heat
   exchanger was used to evaluate the overall heat transfer coefficient and
   the associated pressure. The specific heat capacity of the nanofluids
   was measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results
   showed that the specific heat capacity of the nanofluids with undoped
   and doped CNTs is significantly higher than that of pure water by about
   10\% and 55\%, respectively. The heat transfer rate of the nanofluids
   increased sharply with the CNT dosage the iron nanoparticles loading and
   reached up to 55\% enhancement with doped CNTs. We observed that the
   power required to exchange 1.8 kW heat using nanofluid containing 0.1
   wt.\% of 10 wt.\% Fe2O3-CNTs was 20 times lower than the power required
   to exchange the same amount of heat using water. This is because the
   iron nanoparticles enhanced the dispersion of the CNTs and increased
   their heat capacity and thermal conductivity. Compared with that of pure
   water, the encountered pressure drop of the nanofluid at the same flow
   rate was almost unchanged, resulting in no extra pumping energy penalty.

Abstract = {{Cattle health monitoring on the feedlot is a crucial but nontrivial
   task. The conventional way of monitoring relies heavily on the cowboy's
   visual surveillance, which makes the animal monitoring quality highly
   subjective and correlated with the obviousness of the observed traits.
   In order to achieve early detection of each individual animal's illness,
   in this paper, a wireless sensor network system is developed to monitor
   the animal's feeding and drinking behaviors. A directional antenna is
   used to allow one router to monitor multiple animals simultaneously, and
   an energy efficient mesh routing strategy is proposed to aggregate the
   monitoring data. The performance of the proposed system has been
   evaluated through numerical analysis and simulations. The contributions
   of this paper lie in the novelty and feasibility of using directional
   antenna and wireless sensor network technologies for feedlot animal
   health monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Asphaltenes self-associate and their molecular weight, density, and
   solubility parameter distributions are factors in asphaltene
   precipitation. Thermo-and hydrocracking alter these distributions and
   these changes must be accounted for when modeling solubility. To
   determine these distributions for reacted asphaltenes, heptane extracted
   asphaltenes from native, thermo-cracked, and hydrocracked crude oils
   were fractionated into solubility cuts. The asphaltenes were dissolved
   in toluene and then partially precipitated at specified ratios of
   heptane-to-toluene to generate sets of light (soluble) and heavy
   (insoluble) cuts.
   The molecular weight and density were measured for each cut. The
   molecular weight data were fitted with a self-association model in order
   to predict the distributions at any given concentration. The asphaltenes
   were found to contain a significant fraction of neutral
   (non-associating) species and the molecular weight distribution were
   represented with an exponential mole frequency distribution. The density
   distributions were determined directly from the data and were correlated
   to the cumulative mass frequency. Solubility parameters were calculated
   using a modified regular solution model with the measured density and
   molecular weight distributions as inputs. The solubility parameters were
   also correlated to the cumulative mass frequency distribution. These
   distributions provided fits to asphaltene yield data within the error of
   the measurements. Guidelines are provided to predict asphaltene
   solubility when fraction data are not available, and the model using the
   guidelines matched the experimental data in this study with an average
   deviation of 4 wt\%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study is aimed at the improvement of process conditions for
   catalytic steam gasification of ash-free coal (AFC) integrated with CO2
   capture. A novel modified catalytic hydrogen production reaction
   integrated gasification (M-HyPr-RING) process was proposed for
   high-purity H-2 production from steam gasification of AFC. AFC was
   prepared from lignite coal by solvent extraction with maximum yields of
   67\% on a dry ash free basis at 400 degrees C using hydrotreated heavy
   aromatic hydrocarbons with a coal-to-solvent ratio of approximately 1:
   10.
   The gasification temperature and sorbent-to-carbon (CaO/C) ratio were
   maintained constant for all experiments at 675 degrees C and 2,
   respectively, as determined by our previous findings. The steam
   gasification experiments were conducted on AFC in a fixed-bed reactor in
   the presence of different catalyst loadings (5, 10 and 20 wt\% of
   potassium carbonate) with and without sorbent. A maximum hydrogen molar
   fraction of 85\% (dry basis with nitrogen) was observed with catalyst
   loading of 20\% and CaO/C of 2 after 5 min of steam gasification under
   mild process conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{178}},
Pages = {{290-299}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Low oil prices have motivated development of lower cost recovery
   processes for production of heavy oil and bitumen. Electrical heating
   using heaters has been proposed recently to not only lower costs, but
   also improve energy efficiency and reduce environmental impact compared
   to current thermal recovery methods such as steam assisted gravity
   drainage. Elimination of steam injection from bitumen recovery processes
   greatly decreases the capital and operating costs of oil sand
   development projects and also minimizes the environmental footprint of
   bitumen production. One of the challenges faced during electrical
   heating of bitumen formations is desiccation of the formation around
   downhole heaters at high temperatures resulting in reduced heat delivery
   to the reservoir. This problem can be eased by injection of makeup water
   or solvent to add a convective heat transfer element to the otherwise
   mainly conductive heat transfer from the heater to the formation. In
   this paper a simple analytical model is presented that allows estimation
   of the rate of makeup water or other fluid required for efficient heat
   delivery to the bitumen bearing formations. The effects of formation
   porosity, rock type and fluid saturation on heat transfer are also
   evaluated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Three component mixtures of canola oil, dimethyl carbonate, and
   methanol, catalyzed by suspended calcium oxide (CaO) particles, produced
   a biodiesel that required little further processing. Only the catalyst
   particles needed to be recovered and reused. Substrates for the CaO were
   laboratory-grade acetate, hydroxide, oxalate, and carbonate compounds of
   calcium heated to temperatures >= 850 degrees C at which calcination is
   complete. The catalyst substrate and conversion process determined the
   effectiveness of the catalyst for high product yields. CaO derived from
   calcium carbonate exhibited morphological characteristics that included
   larger contact surface areas, and thus more reactive sites, compared to
   the other precursors. Moreover, with only 0.17 mu g/g (0.017 \%) free
   glycerol present in the produced biodiesel, the biodiesel can be used
   directly without further treatment.}},

Abstract = {{The idea of growing microalgae in wastewaters emerges from the idea of
   resource conservation and the recovery of nutrients. In fact, microalgae
   are able to take up nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon from wastewaters,
   even adsorb metals, and in many cases, can be co-cultivated with various
   bacteria that are prevailing in municipal wastewater treatment plants.
   The cultivation of microalgae in municipal wastewater has been known for
   about half a century and investigated accordingly. Despite this long
   history, there are still many questions to answer before this technology
   will be ready for implementation in large-scale projects. In this
   review, recent developments are presented. One crucial point in
   developing a viable process out of wastewater grown algae is the
   downstream processing of the accumulated algal biomass. The authors
   decided to focus on hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) as a processing
   strategy. HTC uses wet biomass and relatively mild process conditions to
   produce an energy-rich biochar and a liquid fraction that can be further
   processed to higher-value substances. The latest findings in the
   carbonization of microalgae are highlighted in the second part of this
   article.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a new segmentation and grouping framework for road map
   inference from GPS traces. We first present a progressive Density-Based
   Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm with an
   orientation constraint to partition the whole point set of the traces
   into clusters that represent road segments. A new point cluster grouping
   algorithm, according to the topological relationship and spatial
   proximity of the point clusters to recover the road network, is then
   developed. After generating the point clusters, the robust
   Locally-Weighted Scatterplot Smooth (Lowess) method is used to extract
   their centerlines. We then propose to build the topological relationship
   of the centerlines by a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based map matching
   algorithm; and to assess whether the spatial proximity between point
   clusters by assuming the distances from the points to the centerline
   comply with a Gaussian distribution. Finally, the point clusters are
   grouped according to their topological relationship and spatial
   proximity to form strokes for recovering the road map. Experimental
   results show that our algorithm is robust to noise and varied sampling
   rates. The generated road maps show high geometric accuracy.}},

Journal = {{SPE PRODUCTION \& OPERATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{The presence of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the injection and
   production streams of any high-pressure-air-injection (HPAI) project or
   the high oxygen partial pressures associated with
   enriched-air-/oxygen-injection projects may create serious safety
   concerns such as the potential for explosion or corrosion. Compilation
   of field problems and reported solutions from such projects indicate
   that no insurmountable problems exist in the implementation of HPAI
   projects. Generally, the operators have implemented safe operations
   successfully when injecting at pressures as high as 6,000 psi. The
   long-term successes of the HPAI projects in the Williston basin, which
   were initiated in 1978 by Koch Industries and continue to be operated
   today by Continental Resources, have confirmed that HPAI is a viable and
   safe process for recovering light oils.
   A number of oilfield oxygen-injection projects have also been undertaken
   since the early 1980s, when Greenwich Oil operated the first
   oxygen-injection project at Forest Hills, Texas. In Canada during the
   1980s, oxygen was injected by BP/AOSTRA at Marguerite Lake, by Dome
   Petroleum at Lindberg, by Husky Energy at Golden Lake, by Mobil Oil at
   Fosterton, and by Gulf Canada at Pelican. In the US, oxygen-injection
   pilots were operated by Arco in the Holt Sand Unit (HSU), Texas, and
   more recently by NiMin Energy at Pleito Creek, California.
   With increased oxygen partial pressure, there is a greater chance of
   safety or corrosion problems. In fact, the high oxygen content
   associated with the HSU project in west Texas caused a severe energy
   release that resulted in test termination. The reported data on this
   field are scarce, and the nature of the energy release has not been
   discussed in detail.
   This paper will first review the operational aspects of some key
   air-injection field tests. Then, some important details on the HSU
   oxygen-injection pilot test will be discussed as a case study. The
   reasons behind the energy release in the HSU project will be discussed
   by use of the surveillance data, as well as combustion-tube-test and
   numerical-modeling results. Finally, best practices for future operation
   of HPAI tests will be reviewed. This paper is intended to provide a
   better understanding of the safety aspects of air/oxygen handling and
   proper practices in such operations.}},

Pages = {{207-218}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The addition of hydrocarbon or nonhydrocarbon gases to steam can have a
   beneficial effect on the performance of steam-based processes for
   recovery of heavy and extraheavy oils. The performance of these newly
   developed techniques depends on the amount of solvent dissolved in the
   oil and the variation of oil viscosity with temperature. Thus, full
   understanding of the quantitative effects of the solvent on heavy-oil
   viscosity and phase behaviors is crucial for feasibility studies,
   design, and prediction of field-scale processes.
   Thus, the aim of this research is the development of an understanding of
   the phase behavior of carbon dioxide (CO2)/Athabasca-bitumen mixtures.
   It includes both experimental and modeling studies of solubilities and
   saturated-liquid densities and viscosities over a wide range of
   temperatures (up to 200 degrees C), approaching the conditions of
   in-situ steam processes and pressures up to 6 MPa.
   Experimental results indicate that the dissolved gas in bitumen leads to
   a significant oil-viscosity reduction, and the effect is greater at
   lower temperature and higher pressure. The gas-saturated-bitumen
   densities change slightly with the dissolution of CO2. The modeling
   results show that the measured solubilities are represented adequately
   by the modified Peng-Robinson equation of state (Robinson and Peng
   1978), with an average absolute relative deviation (AARD) of 7.5\%. The
   saturated-liquid densities are also correlated with equation-of-state
   and effective-liquid-density approaches, with 0.77 and 0.41\% AARDs,
   respectively. The viscosity data are reasonably matched with the
   modified Pedersen corresponding state (Pedersen and Fredenslund 1987).}},

Title = {{Factors Controlling Fluid Migration and Distribution in the Eagle Ford
   Shale}},
Journal = {{SPE RESERVOIR EVALUATION \& ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{403-414}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Production of shale and tight oil is the cornerstone of the United
   States race for energy independence. According to the US Energy
   Information Administration, approximately 90\% of the oil-production
   growth comes from six tight-oil plays. The Eagle Ford is one of these
   plays, and it accounts for 33\% of the oil-production growth with a
   contribution of 1.3 million B/D. This is outstanding. However, oil
   recoveries as a percentage of the original oil in place (OOIP) are
   extremely low. This must be improved.
   A geological challenge in the Eagle Ford shale is the understanding of
   unconventional fluids distribution over geologic time: Shallower in the
   structure, there is black oil; deeper and to the south; condensate
   appears; and at the bottom, dry gas can be found. Differences in burial
   depth, temperature, and vitrinite reflectance are used to explain this
   unique distribution. A similar fluid distribution occurs in other
   unconventional reservoirs (e.g., Duvernay shale in Canada).
   The low oil recovery and the unusual distribution of fluids led to the
   key objective of this paper-to identify the main factors that control
   fluid migration (caused by buoyancy of gas in oil) from one zone to
   another through geologic time. This was performed by constructing a
   conceptual cross-sectional compositional simulation model with
   northwest/southeast orientation that allowed the study of fluid
   migration, fluid distribution, and fluid contacts throughout 1 million
   years while maintaining computational time within reasonable limits. The
   controlling parameters studied were porosity, permeability, pore-throat
   aperture (r(p35)), and spacing between natural fractures.
   Results show that fluids in the matrix remained with approximately the
   same original distribution (i.e., approximately the same
   dry-gas/condensate contact and approximately the same condensate/oil
   contact). These fluids are the target of an ongoing research project
   with the ultimate goal of improving oil recovery from tight reservoirs
   by means of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) (Fragoso et al. 2015). There is,
   however, some gas migration through natural fractures to the top of the
   structure. This migration is interpreted in this study to be responsible
   for higher initial gas production in some oil wells in the top of the
   structure. Some operators indicate, however, that rapid gas/oil-ratio
   increases in the updip oil region are the result of low reservoir
   pressures and the rapid onset of two-phase flow. It would probably take
   geochemical evidence to support this conclusion.}},

Journal = {{SPE RESERVOIR EVALUATION \& ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{450-465}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Recent work has shown that flow units characterized by process or
   delivery speed (the ratio of permeability to porosity) provide a
   continuum between conventional, tight-gas, shale-gas, tight-oil, and
   shale-oil reservoirs (Aguilera 2014). The link between the various
   hydrocarbon fluids is provided by the word ``petroleum{''} in ``Total
   Petroleum System{''} (TPS), which encompasses liquid and gas
   hydrocarbons found in conventional, tight, and shale reservoirs. The
   work also shows that, other things being equal, the smaller pores lead
   to smaller production rates.
   There is, however, a positive side to smaller pores that, under
   favorable conditions, can lead to larger economic benefits from
   organic-rich shale reservoirs. This occurs in the case of condensate
   fluids that behave as dry gas in the smaller pores of organic-rich shale
   reservoirs. Flow of this dry gas diminishes the amount of liquids that
   are released and lost permanently in a shale reservoir. Conversely, this
   dry gas can lead to larger recovery of liquids in the surface from a
   given shale reservoir and consequently more attractive economics. This
   study shows how the smaller pores and their associated dry gas can be
   recognized with the use of process speed (flow units) and modified
   Pickett plots. Data from the Niobrara and Eagle Ford shales are used to
   demonstrate these crossplots.
   It is concluded that there is significant practical potential in the use
   of process speed as part of the flow-unit characterization of shale
   condensate reservoirs. This, in turn, can help in locating sweet spots
   for improved liquid production. The main contribution of this work is
   the association of flow units and different scales of pore apertures for
   improving recovery of liquids from shale reservoirs.}},

Title = {{A New Approach for Permeability Prediction With NMR Measurements in
   Tight Formations}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Prediction of extremely low permeability in tight reservoirs poses major
   challenges with traditional methods. Several studies have proposed
   nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) permeability predictors, but these
   often give large errors when applied in tight formations. In this
   report, we describe a new method with NMR well-log measurements that
   decomposes the T-2 spectrum into, at most, three Gaussian components. On
   the basis of parameters from the decomposition, we build a
   pore-size-based lithofacies model to predict whole-core horizontal
   permeability. With these parameters, we also modify the empirical
   Timur-Coates equation (TIM) to predict permeability.
   The NMR decomposition allows us to predict proportions of shale and
   silt. Applied to the tight Cardium formation, the parameters correlate
   strongly with core image and X-Ray-diffraction (XRD) results. In
   addition to Cardium data, we apply our approach to published data sets
   with good results, showing that the model gives accurate
   lithofacies-proportion estimates.
   To calibrate the model, Cardium probe permeameter data are used to
   identify facies permeabilities. Arithmetic-averaged permeability with
   the NMR-based model was calculated to compare with whole-core horizontal
   permeability. Monte Carlo analysis confirms the agreement between the
   model and core-permeability values. Our model provides a ``bridge{''} to
   relate permeability between the probe scale (<1 cm laminations) and core
   size (>15 cm thin beds).
   Without the NMR well-log decomposition, Cardium TIM permeability
   predictions are in error by more than one order of magnitude in most
   intervals. The major challenge with the TIM model is obtaining an
   accurate T-2 cutoff value. Compared with coremeasured bound-water
   saturations, the default 33 ms value is too large for our tight samples.
   Our NMR decomposition, however, shows good correlation with measured
   bound-water saturations. With several core samples and NMR parameters,
   we modified the TIM model and found that it provides very good
   permeability predictions.}},

   speeds equal to only 24, 40.96, and 61.44 Ms/s, respectively. Despite
   these very low sampling rates, a quasiperfect cancellation of the PA
   distortions was achieved (more than 50 dBc in terms of ACLR), in all
   tests, over bandwidths including up to fifth-order intermodulation
   distortions. Such a correction bandwidth is much wider than the
   observation bandwidths associated with the receiver sampling rates.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, degradation of bisphenol S (BPS) in spiked water and
   postsecondary-treated wastewater by a variety of oxidation processes was
   investigated in a flow-through reactor. Kinetics of degradation in O3,
   ultraviolet (UV)/O3, UV/H2O2, and UV/O3/H2O2 were determined and
   reported. The degradation of BPS by O3 alone was competitive with the
   UV-promoted methods. An increase in BPS loss with O3 was observed in
   postsecondary-treated wastewater, demonstrating its potential
   application as a treatment method for BPS. Total organic carbon (TOC) as
   an indicator of the extent of organic compound mineralization and
   sulfate as a by-product produced during degradation were measured. It
   was noted that although the loss of BPS was similar in the UV/O3/H2O2
   and the O3 processes, the overall mineralization rate was different,
   indicating that the combination technique offers a more efficient system
   in terms of overall mineralization rate. The UV/O3/H2O2 process was the
   most effective and led to complete mineralization of 50mg/L BPS within
   90min in both spiked water and postsecondary-treated wastewater.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, corrosion at the tip of stress corrosion cracks on an X65
   pipeline steel was investigated under various stress levels in a
   near-neutral pH solution. Electrochemical and micro-electrochemical
   measurements, combined with surface characterization and stress
   simulation, were conducted to understand the mechanistic aspects of
   stress enhanced corrosion at crack tip and its role in crack propagation
   in the steel. Results demonstrated that significant stress
   concentrations can develop at crack tip and enhance corrosion of the
   steel in the solution. The steel is in an active dissolution state. The
   crack propagation rate increases with the enhanced corrosion at the
   crack tip. However, the cracking mechanism is stress dependent. At the
   applied load of 600 N, the crack propagation is mainly a result of the
   steel dissolution at the crack tip. When the local stress level at the
   crack tip is smaller than this value, corrosion, rather than cracking,
   occurs inside the crack. When the stress level at the crack tip is
   sufficiently high to exceed the stress associated with the applied load
   of 600 N, corrosion becomes less important in the cracking process.
   Instead, the stress factor dominates the stress corrosion crack
   propagation.}},

Abstract = {{The production of heavy and extra-heavy oil is challenging because of
   the rheological properties that crude oil presents due to its high
   asphaltene content. The upgrading and recovery processes of these
   unconventional oils are typically water and energy intensive, which
   makes such processes costly and environmentally unfriendly. Nanoparticle
   catalysts could be used to enhance the upgrading and recovery of heavy
   oil under both in situ and ex situ conditions. In this study, the effect
   of the Ni-Pd nanocatalysts supported on fumed silica nanoparticles on
   post-adsorption catalytic thermal cracking of n-C-7 asphaltenes was
   investigated using a thermogravimetric analyzer coupled with FTIR. The
   performance of catalytic thermal cracking of n-C-7 asphaltenes in the
   presence of NiO and PdO supported on fumed silica nanoparticles was
   better than on the fumed silica support alone. For a fixed amount of
   adsorbed n-C-7 asphaltenes (0.2 mg/m(2)), bimetallic nanoparticles
   showed better catalytic behavior than monometallic nanoparticles,
   confirming their synergistic effects. The corrected Ozawa-Flynn-Wall
   equation (OFW) was used to estimate the effective activation energies of
   the catalytic process. The mechanism function, kinetic parameters, and
   transition state thermodynamic functions for the thermal cracking
   process of n-C-7 asphaltenes in the presence and absence of
   nanoparticles are investigated.}},

Abstract = {{3D random networks are constructed in order to represent the tight
   Mesaverde formation which is located in north Wyoming, USA. The
   porous-space is represented by pore bodies of different shapes and sizes
   which are connected to each other by pore throats of varying length and
   diameter. Pore bodies are randomly distributed in space and their
   connectivity varies based on the connectivity number distribution which
   is used in order to generate the network. Network representations are
   then validated using publicly available mercury porosimetry experiments.
   The network modeling software solves the fundamental equations of
   two-phase immiscible flow incorporating wettability and contact angle
   variability. Quasi-static displacement is assumed. Single phase
   macroscopic properties (porosity, permeability) are calculated and
   whenever possible are compared to experimental data. Using this
   information drainage and imbibition capillary pressure, and relative
   permeability curves are predicted and (whenever possible) compared to
   experimental data.
   The calculated information is grouped and compared to available
   literature information on typical behavior of tight formations.
   Capillary pressure curve for primary drainage process is predicted and
   compared to experimental mercury porosimetry in order to validate the
   virtual porous media by history matching. Relative permeability curves
   are also calculated and presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Relative importance of P and N in macrophyte and epilithic algae biomass
   in a wastewater-impacted oligotrophic river}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{188}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The role of nutrient loading on biomass growth in wastewater-impacted
   rivers is important in order to effectively optimize wastewater
   treatment to avoid excessive biomass growth in the receiving water body.
   This paper directly relates wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent
   nutrients (including ammonia (NH3-N), nitrate (NO3 -N) and total
   phosphorus (TP)) to the temporal and spatial distribution of epilithic
   algae and macrophyte biomass in an oligotrophic river. Annual macrophyte
   biomass, epilithic algae data and WWTP effluent nutrient data from 1980
   to 2012 were statistically analysed. Because discharge can affect
   aquatic biomass growth, locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS)
   was used to remove the influence of river discharge from the aquatic
   biomass (macrophytes and algae) data before further analysis was
   conducted. The results from LOWESS indicated that aquatic biomass did
   not increase beyond site-specific threshold discharge values in the
   river. The LOWESS-estimated biomass residuals showed a variable response
   to different nutrients. Macrophyte biomass residuals showed a decreasing
   trend concurrent with enhanced nutrient removal at the WWTP and
   decreased effluent P loading, whereas epilithic algae biomass residuals
   showed greater response to enhanced N removal. Correlation analysis
   between effluent nutrient concentrations and the biomass residuals (both
   epilithic algae and macrophytes) suggested that aquatic biomass is
   nitrogen limited, especially by NH3-N, at most sampling sites. The
   response of aquatic biomass residuals to effluent nutrient
   concentrations did not change with increasing distance to the WWTP but
   was different for P and N, allowing for additional conclusions about
   nutrient limitation in specific river reaches. The data further showed
   that the mixing process between the effluent and the river has an
   influence on the spatial distribution of biomass growth.}},

Title = {{Failure in granular media from an energy viewpoint}},
Journal = {{GRANULAR MATTER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The present paper examines failure in discrete granular media with
   respect to its mode and nature based on energetic considerations through
   a comprehensive discrete element modelling computational analysis. The
   mode of failure refers to whether deformations will localize into an
   intense shear band or be diffuse. More subtly, a given failure mode can
   be effective with a burst of kinetic energy, or non-effective with a
   more controlled release of kinetic energy, depending on the control
   parameter. Physical quantities based on energy considerations with
   elementary decompositions of externally applied energy into elastic,
   plastic and kinetic contributions at the particle level are computed for
   a number of granular assemblies under a variety of failure scenarios.
   With the picture of a particle system experiencing macroscopic
   deformations according to underlying micro- and meso-mechanisms, it is
   concluded that computed grain-energy components depend on the
   microstructural detail that emerges as a function of loading program and
   control parameter. The relationship between elastic unloading outside a
   shear band and plastic dissipation inside it under both strain and
   stress control modes determines the genesis of shear banding in terms of
   plastic work dissipation minimization. Most interestingly, it is found
   that the energy signature inside the shear band in a dense granular
   packing is germane to energy characteristics of diffuse failure in a
   loose assembly, suggesting some similarities in microscopic failure
   processes between shear banding and diffuse failure.}},

Title = {{Onset of structural evolution in granular materials as a redundancy
   problem}},
Journal = {{GRANULAR MATTER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The present paper is concerned with the redundancy of equations
   describing the static equilibrium of a granular assembly in relation to
   emergent behavioural features in granular materials such as critical
   state, jamming transition, instabilities and yielding. It is proposed to
   link the concept of jamming to critical state phenomena by introducing a
   limiting micromechanical state at which large plastic (dissipative)
   structural evolution can occur, while static equilibrium is still
   maintained. Such a state, herein coined as a Stable Evolution State
   (SES), can be numerically determined based on a number of 2D Discrete
   Element Method (DEM) simulations on loose granular assemblies for a
   given interparticle friction, but with varying contact stiffnesses, and
   subjected to various loading paths. By tracing the evolutions of
   essential micro-variables such as fabric (contact normal) anisotropy,
   coordination number and rigidity ratio (ratio of mean contact force to
   contact stiffness and diameter) as well as the onset of plastic
   dissipation, a well-defined limit surface emerges in the space spanning
   coordination number, fabric anisotropy and rigidity ratio.
   Interestingly, the same surface is reached when conducting other DEM
   simulations on dense granular assemblies with the same interparticle
   friction along a variety of loading paths and control conditions,
   thereby verifying the existence of such a characteristic SES surface.
   This suggests a new reference state in granular materials which
   facilitates the mathematical formulation of multiscale constitutive laws
   as it provides an essential link to plastic yielding and critical state
   in geomaterials.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{131}},
Pages = {{214-221}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Reservoir quality and productivity of tight formations depend heavily on
   the degree of fracture development. In fact, hard and dense carbonate
   formations may not be considered, as net pay without the presence of
   fractures that convey fluids towards the wellbore. The evaluation of
   fractures is key to effective reservoir characterization for purposes
   like well drilling and completion as well as development and simulation
   of fractured reservoirs. Although imaging technologies such as Formation
   Micro-Scanners and Imagers (FMS and FMI) provide useful information
   about fracture properties (i.e., dip angle, porosity, aperture, and
   permeability), they are very expensive and may not be available in all
   wells. In this work, fracture parameters are estimated using
   conventional dual laterolog (DLL) resistivity which includes shallow
   (LLS) and deep (LLD) responses. This technique is based on electrical
   resistivity anomalies resulting from the separation of shallow and deep
   laterolog curves. Fracture parameters that can be calculated by DLL
   include dip angle, aperture, porosity, permeability, and cementation
   factor. The accuracy of the parameters calculated using DLL data is
   validated by the results of FMI in a well in one of the Iranian
   fractured reservoirs. Contrary to the image logs, the conventional DLL
   is run routinely in all drilled wells. Therefore, if a reservoir has
   limited and insufficient data of image logs, as it is often the case,
   the DLLs can be used as a reliable replacement in the construction of
   fracture models. Furthermore, DLL has an advantage of deeper evaluation
   of fractures in comparison with the immediate borehole investigation of
   image logs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The key challenge of extracting oil from oil sand reservoirs is the
   viscosity of the oil which is typically between 100000 and several
   million cP. To reduce the viscosity of the oil, high pressure, high
   temperature steam, typically between about 185 and 250 degrees C, is
   injected into the reservoir by using recovery processes such as the
   steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) process. In this process, steam
   heats the bitumen and as a consequence, its viscosity drops to about 5cP
   and it readily flows under gravity within the reservoir. One key issue
   that has not gained much attention with respect to SAGD process
   evolution are steam-rock reactions, water geochemistry, and how the
   produced water composition varies as the process evolves. Here, we
   examine how the produced water composition varies in SAGD operations.
   For the first time, we show that the produced water composition can be
   used to detect shale barriers and contact of the steam chamber with the
   overburden. As yet, the produced water composition is not used to
   understand in situ process development but as we show here, this could
   be a rich data source for understanding process dynamics. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{Current WiFi positioning systems (WPSs) require databases - such as
   locations of WiFi access points and propagation parameters, or a radio
   map - to assist with positioning. Typically, procedures for building
   such databases are time-consuming and labour-intensive. In this paper,
   two autonomous crowdsourcing systems are proposed to build the databases
   on handheld devices by using our designed algorithms and an inertial
   navigation solution from a Trusted Portable Navigator (T-PN). The
   proposed systems, running on smartphones, build and update the database
   autonomously and adaptively to account for the dynamic environment. To
   evaluate the performance of automatically generated databases, two
   improved WiFi positioning schemes (fingerprinting and trilateration)
   corresponding to these two database building systems, are also
   discussed. The main contribution of the paper is the proposal of two
   crowdsourcing-based WPSs that eliminate the various limitations of
   current crowdsourcing-based systems which (a) require a floor plan or
   GPS, (b) are suitable only for specific indoor environments, and (c)
   implement a simple MEMS-based sensors' solution. In addition, these two
   WPSs are evaluated and compared through field tests. Results in
   different test scenarios show that average positioning errors of both
   proposed systems are all less than 5.75 m.}},

Title = {{On the trajectory of leading-edge vortices under the influence of
   Coriolis acceleration}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{800}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Leading-edge vortices (LEVs) can form and remain attached to a rotating
   wing indefinitely, but the mechanisms of stable attachment are not well
   understood. Taking for granted that such stable structures do form, a
   practical question arises: what is the trajectory of the LEV core?
   Noting that span-wise flow exists within the LEV core, it is apparent
   that a mean streamline aligned with the axis of the stable LEV must
   exist. The present work uses the Navier-Stokes equations along such a
   steady, axial streamline in order to consider the accelerations that act
   in the streamline-normal direction to affect its local curvature. With
   some simplifying assumptions, a coupled system of ordinary differential
   equations is derived that describes the trajectory of an axial
   streamline through the vortex core. The model is compared to previous
   work, and is found to predict the trajectory of the LEV core well at
   span-wise locations inboard of the midspan. This result suggests that
   Coriolis acceleration is responsible for limiting the span-wise extent
   of a stable LEV by tilting it into the wake within several chord lengths
   from the centre of rotation. The downwash due to the tip vortex also
   appears to play a role, as the only significant differences between
   model-predicted LEV trajectories and previous results are in the
   plate-normal direction.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},

Abstract = {{Increasing complexity in manufacturing strategies and swift changes in
   market and consumer requirements have driven recent studies of
   manufacturing systems, with transient behavior being identified as a key
   research area. Till date, satisfying consumer demand has focused on
   steady-state planning of production, mostly using stochastic or
   deterministic optimal control methods. Due to the difficulty of
   obtaining optimal control for many practical situations, as well as in
   evaluating performance under optimal control, these studies have not
   been conducive to the analysis or control of transient behavior. This
   paper bridges this gap by applying model predictive control to a
   manufacturing system modeled as a discrete-time Markov chain. By
   modifying the initiation of production as probabilities within the
   Markov chain, a method is proposed to directly control the system to
   specific expected performance levels and improve its stochastic
   transient behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigates the quality of surface sediments from the
   Bizerte lagoon (North Tunisia) using an integrated approach including
   chemical contaminant analysis, bioassays and sediment quality guidelines
   (SQGs). Sediment samples were collected at 9 sites and analyzed for
   eight heavy metals (Hg, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni, Fe and Mn). PAHs, PCBs,
   OCPs were measured previously in the same sediment samples. Our results
   indicated that the highest concentrations of metals were found near
   urban areas due to the municipial and industrial wastewater discharges.
   Sediment pollution assessment was carried out using geoaccumulation
   index and enrichment factor, which indicate a widespread pollution by
   Cd, Pb, Ni and Zn in the studied sediments. For bioassays, aqueous and
   organic extracts were used to assess toxicity and genotoxicity in
   sediments by using Microtox(A (R)) and SOS Chromotest, respectively.
   Toxicity levels were compared to metallic and organic pollutants
   contents. Our results highlight differences in the pattern of responses
   between the different assays and show no correlation with all the
   studied contaminants, emphasizing the influence of other contaminants
   not analyzed in the present study. Based on SQGs, the results of
   toxicity assessment indicated that adverse effects caused by Ni and Zn
   would be expected frequently. Nickel was found to have the highest
   predicted acute toxicity, followed by Zn, Pb, Cd, Cu and Cr. There was
   no significant relationship between sediment toxicity calculated from
   heavy metal concentrations (SQG approach) and those measured with
   bioassays. These findings support the use of integrated approachs for
   evaluating the environmental risks of sediments.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{128}},
Pages = {{22-31}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Destructive snow avalanches in western Canada are often caused by
   failure in buried surface hoar layers. Numerical snow cover models can
   simulate the formation and evolution of these layers; which could help
   avalanche forecasters assess the location and timing of avalanches. To
   investigate this application, we compared modelled surface hoar layers
   with snow and avalanche observations from the Coast, Columbia, and Rocky
   Mountains of western Canada. Surface hoar formation and evolution was
   modelled by forcing the snow cover model SNOWPACK with data from a
   high-resolution numerical weather prediction model. Surface hoar
   formation was verified with daily snow surface observations at 88
   observation sites over two winters, and the evolution of buried layers
   was verified with avalanche observations and persistent weak layer
   assessments from 67 avalanche forecast regions. The frequency of surface
   hoar formation was over predicted by 40\%, although since modelled
   crystal sizes were moderately correlated with observed sizes, the more
   hazardous layers were often distinguished. A structural stability index
   in SNOWPACK often identified surface hoar layers during storm slab
   avalanche activity, but identifying layers during persistent slab
   avalanche activity was more difficult. Model limitations included
   uncertain meteorological inputs, errors in SNOWPACK's snow surface
   energy balance, and representing the necessary spatial scales. Despite
   these limitations, the coupled model resolved differences between major
   Canadian mountain ranges and could improve avalanche forecasts in
   data-sparse-regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{187-194}},

Abstract = {{An improved model for the estimation of gasification rate constants
   using CO2 and steam as gasifying agents is presented in this work. The
   theoretically deduced model only considers the micropore surface area
   and catalyst (alkali) content of the raw feedstock as inputs for the
   gasification rate estimation. The main advantage compared with other
   models is its simplicity in determining the rate constant with only one
   regression parameter, which is a result of introducing, for the first
   time, theoretical limits to the activation energy of the main
   gasification reactions (steam gasification and Boudouard reactions).
   Experiments were carried out in a setup that reduces the most common
   problems associated with laboratory gasification procedures, such as
   misinterpretation of a maximum gasification rate, adverse effects on the
   char properties during the pyrolysis phase, and interparticle diffusion.
   Statistical analysis showed that the model fitted well with experimental
   data, since the determination coefficient was higher than 0.96 for 13
   coal samples with a broad range of ash contents (6.4\% to 74.8\%).
   The new model gives an accurate mixing rule that is useful in
   determining gasification rates of different feedstock mixtures. The new
   concepts presented in this research can be used for simulating and
   determining suitable process conditions for industrial gasifiers
   operating with different feed mixtures. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with different geometrical
   characteristics and chemical doping have been synthesized and
   electrochemically oxidized to study the possibility of unzipping, and
   creating graphene nanoribbon (GNR) nanostructures. Modified glassy
   carbon electrodes of the MWCNTs have been tested in an aqueous
   electrolyte via anodic scans in a wide range of potentials, followed by
   keeping at the maximum potential for different times. The
   microstructural features, structural defects, and functional groups and
   their elements have been then studied using high resolution transmission
   electron microscopy (HRTEM), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. All results have confirmed that no
   successful unzipping occurs in the MWCNTs after electrochemical
   oxidation, even for the nitrogen-doped MWCNTs (CNx-MWCNTs) with reactive
   nitrogen groups and defective bamboo structures. In contrast to the
   report by Shinde et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011, 133, 4168-4171), it has
   been concluded that the electrochemical oxidation in aqueous
   electrolytes is very unlikely to facilitate sufficient incorporation of
   the intercalated molecules among the walls of the MWCNTs. These
   molecules are, however, responsible for unzipping of MWCNTs. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Multi-modal explosive sensors based on microelectromechanical systems
   (MEMS) have been developed. Opto-calorimetric infrared (IR)
   spectroscopy, capable of obtaining molecular signatures of extremely
   small quantities of adsorbed explosive molecules, has been realized with
   the use of microheater/thermometer devices and a widely tunable quantum
   cascade laser. These devices respond to the heat generated by
   non-radiative decay process when the adsorbed explosive molecules are
   resonantly excited with IR light. Monitoring the variation in
   microthermometer signal as a function of illuminating IR wavelength
   corresponds to the conventional IR absorption spectrum of the adsorbed
   molecules. Moreover, the mass of the adsorbed molecules is determined by
   measuring the resonance frequency shift of the device for the
   quantitative analysis. In addition, micro-differential thermal analysis,
   which can be used to differentiate exothermic or endothermic reaction of
   heated molecules, has been performed with the same devices to provide
   additional orthogonal signal for trace explosive detection and sensor
   surface regeneration. We have demonstrated successful detection,
   differentiation, and quantification of trace amounts of explosive
   molecules (cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX) and pentaerythritol
   tetranitrate (PETN)) and their mixtures using three orthogonal sensing
   signals. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   coalbed methane}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{149}},

Month = {{JUL 31}},
Abstract = {{The discovery that approximately 20\% of natural gas is microbial in
   origin has elevated interest in microbially enhanced coalbed methane
   (MECoM). However, a rational approach to exploit this calls for the
   development of reservoir scale models that include the effect of
   microbial activity. To address this, we have developed a multiscale,
   multiphase, multicomponent reactive -transport model for the production
   of microbially enhanced coalbed methane (MECoM) that includes microbial
   kinetics. The model is used to evaluate field scale strategies for
   commercial MECoM production. Optimization studies are also conducted
   over a range of compositions of the injected nutrient and injector
   bottomhole pressures. In order to account for the effect of uncertainty
   in the model parameters, mean -variance robust optimization is
   performed, allowing a trade-off between performance and robustness.
   Proxy modeling is performed in a multivariate polynomial chaos expansion
   framework to evaluate the cost functions involved in the robust
   optimization and sparse expansions are constructed in order to deal with
   issues related to high dimensionality. The optimization strategy is
   tested for different trade-offs between robustness and performance. It
   is observed that for the given case, the location of robust optimal
   points does not vary unless only robustness is included in the objective
   function, and nominal performance is not. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Classical (surfactant stabilized) and Pickering (particle stabilized)
   type emulsions have been widely studied to elucidate the mechanisms by
   which emulsion stabilization is achieved. In Pickering emulsions, a key
   defining factor is that the stabilizing particles reside at the liquid
   liquid interface providing a mechanical barrier to droplet coalescence.
   This interfacial adsorption is achieved through the use of nano
   particles that are partially wet by both liquid phases, often through
   covalent surface modification of or surfactant adsorption to the
   nanoparticle surfaces. Herein, we demonstrate particle-induced
   stabilization of an oil-in-water emulsion with fully water wet
   nanoparticles (no interfacial adsorption) via synergistic interaction
   with low concentrations of surfactants. Laser scanning confocal
   microscopy analysis allows for unique and vital insights into the
   properties of these emulsions via both three-dimensional imaging and
   real-time monitoring of particle dynamics at the oil water interface.
   Investigation of these ``non-Pickering{''} particle stabilized emulsions
   suggests that the nonadsorbed particles impart stability to the emulsion
   primarily via entropic forces imparted by the accumulation of silica
   nanoparticles in the coherent phase between dispersed oil droplets.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a discrete-time learning algorithm for fast image

   noise constrained estimation approach can relax the need of the optimal
   regularization parameter to be estimated. Performance analysis shows
   that the proposed algorithm can converge globally to a robust optimal
   weight vector. Compared with the cooperative neural fusion (CNF)
   algorithm minimizing L-1-norm estimation, the proposed algorithm only
   needs O(N) multiplication operationper iteration, instead of O(N-2)
   multiplication operation required by the CNF algorithm. Moreover, the
   proposed fusion approach overcomes the difficulty of estimating the
   noise error set in the CNF approach. Simulation results show by
   comparison that under the non-optimal regularization parameter, the
   proposed algorithm can obtain a better restored estimate in Gaussian
   mixture noise and can run much faster compared to the CNF algorithm. (C)

Month = {{JUL 12}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this work is to comprehensively review recent findings on
   gasification kinetics related to the reaction mechanism, the effects of
   the experimental procedure on the overall reaction, and methods to
   evaluate kinetic models.
   Understanding the recent findings in gasification requires the
   presentation of selected publications that cover several potentially
   ambiguous concepts. Firstly, conventional reactor definitions are not
   sufficient given that three reactions (combustion, pyrolysis and
   gasification) occur in an industrial gasifier. Secondly, variables
   affecting char reactivity during gasification show that the char surface
   area is the most complex variable to analyze. Also, single-step kinetic
   models provide better descriptions of the reaction mechanism assuming
   kinetic control of the overall reaction.
   The new findings are related to the gasification reaction mechanism and
   the interpretation of kinetic results: (a) the maximum gasification rate
   observed is a consequence of the gas concentration development upon
   changing the inert gas for the gasifying agent, and not due to changes
   in the char surface during gasification, as proposed by Bhatia and
   Perlmutter in 1980; (b) increasing the time of holding the char at the
   reaction temperature in an inert gas decreases the gasification rate;
   (c) char micropore surface area and alkali content are the two most
   important variables affecting the gasification rate; and, (d) laboratory
   studies may not represent the real gasification mechanism under
   kinetically controlled conditions due to the presence of mass transfer
   limitations from interparticle diffusion. Therefore, the acceptance of
   intrinsic kinetics reported in the literature should be revalidated. (C)

Abstract = {{Knowledge learning is the sixth and the most fundamental category of
   machine learning mimicking the brain. It is recognized that the semantic
   space of machine knowledge is a hierarchical concept network (HCN),
   which can be rigorously represented by formal concepts in concept
   algebra and semantic algebra. This paper presents theories and
   algorithms of hierarchical concept classification by quantitative
   semantic analysis based on machine learning. Semantic equivalence
   between formal concepts is rigorously measured by an Algorithm of
   Concept Equivalence Analysis (ACEA). The semantic hierarchy among formal
   concepts is quantitatively determined by an Algorithm of Relational
   Semantic Classification (ARSC). Experiments applying Algorithms ACEA and
   ARSC on a set of formal concepts have been successfully conducted, which
   demonstrate a deep machine understanding of formal concepts and
   quantitative relations in the hierarchical semantic space by machine
   learning beyond human empirical perspectives.}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing interest to develop microfluidic bioreactors and
   organ-on-chip platforms with integrated sensors to monitor their
   physicochemical properties and to maintain a well-controlled
   microenvironment for cultured organoids. Conventional sensing devices
   cannot be easily integrated with microfluidic organ-on-chip systems with
   low-volume bioreactors for continual monitoring. This paper reports on
   the development of a multi-analyte optical sensing module for dynamic
   measurements of pH and dissolved oxygen levels in the culture medium.
   The sensing system was constructed using low-cost electro-optics
   including light-emitting diodes and silicon photodiodes. The sensing
   module includes an optically transparent window for measuring light
   intensity, and the module could be connected directly to a perfusion
   bioreactor without any specific modifications to the microfluidic device
   design. A compact, user-friendly, and low-cost electronic interface was
   developed to control the optical transducer and signal acquisition from
   photodiodes. The platform enabled convenient integration of the optical
   sensing module with a microfluidic bioreactor. Human dermal fibroblasts
   were cultivated in the bioreactor, and the values of pH and dissolved
   oxygen levels in the flowing culture medium were measured continuously
   for up to 3 days. Our integrated microfluidic system provides a new
   analytical platform with ease of fabrication and operation, which can be
   adapted for applications in various microfluidic cell culture and
   organ-on-chip devices. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Title = {{Two phase flow of liquids in a narrow gap: Phase interference and
   hysteresis}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Co-current flow of two immiscible liquids, such as oil and water in a
   planar fracture, exhibits nonlinear structures which become important in
   many natural and engineering systems such as subsurface flows,
   multiphase flows in lubrication joints, and coating flows. In this
   context, co-current flow of oil and water with variable rates is
   experimentally studied in a Hele-Shaw cell, various flow regimes are
   classified, and relative permeabilities for the phases are analysed
   thoroughly. Similar to multiphase pipe flows, multiphase flow in planar
   gaps shows various flow regimes, each having different flow
   rate/pressure gradient behaviour. As well as recovering the known
   results in the immiscible displacements in Hele-Shaw cell where the
   fluid-fluid interface remains stable/unstable for favorable/adverse
   viscosity ratios, it is found that the co-current flow of two fluids
   with different viscosities results in three distinct flow regimes.
   Before breakthrough of non-wetting phase, i.e, water, a ``linear
   displacement{''} flow regime initially establishes at very low water
   injection rates. This stable movement turns into a ``fingering
   advancement{''} flow regime at high water flow rates and Saffman-Taylor
   instability develops normal to the direction of the flow. After the
   breakthrough, a ``droplet formation{''} flow regime is identified where
   the droplets of wetting phase, oil, are trapped in the water phase. For
   subsurface flow applications, we quantify these regimes through relative
   permeability curves. It is reported that as the water flow rate
   increases, the relative permeabilities and flow channels become smooth
   and regular. This behaviour of relative permeability and saturations
   shows dominance of capillary forces at low flow rates and viscous forces
   at higher flow rates. Variable injection rates provide the interface
   structures for both drainage and imbibition process, where the wetting
   phase saturation decreases and increases respectively. It is shown that
   relative permeability curves exhibit hysteresis, thus the process is
   irreversible. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{The pressure-decay technique is used to determine the diffusivity and
   solubility of methane and carbon dioxide in pure hydrocarbons and
   bitumen at temperatures of 0, 15, 20, and 25 degrees C and pressure of
   3.5 MPa. An analytical graphical technique is implemented to extract the
   related mass-transfer parameters, i.e., diffusion coefficient and
   Henry's constant, from the pressure-decay data. The results reveal that
   the diffusion coefficient of methane and carbon dioxide in both pure
   hydrocarbons and bitumen decreases as the temperature decreases. On the
   basis of the estimated Henry's constants, the effect of the temperature
   on the solubility of the gaseous solvents in bitumen and pure
   hydrocarbons is also determined. As expected, the solubility of both
   gases in the studied pure hydrocarbons increases as the temperature
   decreases. In addition to confirmation of the known trends, this study
   provides new experimental data for the low-temperature gas hydrocarbon
   diffusion process.}},

Abstract = {{Several factors influencing the stability of asphaltene- and
   bitumen-stabilized water-in-oil emulsions were investigated including
   salt type, salt concentration, pH, interfacial film properties, surface
   coverage, drop size, and emulsion packing. Emulsions were prepared from
   bitumens (and their asphaltenes) from an oil sands mining process, a
   cyclic steam process, and a steam-assisted gravity drainage process. The
   aqueous phases consisted of reverse-osmosis water and salts (NaCl,
   CaCl2, Na2SO4, KCl, and Na2CO3), and the organic phases consisted of 10
   g/L asphaltenes (extracted with n-heptane) or crude oil bitumen
   dissolved in heptane toluene solutions. The stability of the emulsions
   was assessed in terms of the percentage of water resolved after repeated
   treatment cycles involving heating at 60 degrees C and centrifugation at
   3500 rpm. The bitumen water systems had similar behavior to the
   asphaltene-water systems, suggesting that the emulsion stabilizers come
   primarily from the asphaltenes. Irreversibly adsorbed interfacial films
   were formed in all cases, a condition necessary for mechanical
   stabilization. Salt contents as low as 0.02 wt \% were found to
   significantly increase the stability of the emulsions. The increase in
   stability correlated with an increase in the mass and apparent molecular
   weight of asphaltenes adsorbed at the interface. A mass surface coverage
   of 5 mg/m(2) and an apparent molecular weight of 7000 g/mol appear to be
   the threshold required for stable emulsions.}},

   each barrel of produced oil. This requires large quantities of water and
   natural gas, resulting in sizable greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and
   extensive postproduction water treatment. There are ongoing efforts to
   make SAGD more energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable by
   reducing steam consumption while maintaining favorable oil production
   rates and ultimate oil recovery. Such efforts include the coinjection of
   steam and solvent in a process called expanding solvent SAGD (ES-SAGD)
   wherein bitumen that is essentially immobile at initial reservoir
   conditions is made mobile by heating and mixing solvent into the oil. In
   this work, experiments are reported in which cracked naphtha is applied
   as an additive to steam for the production of Long Lake bitumen. The
   results conclusively demonstrate that coinjecting cracked naphtha with
   steam, under specific conditions, significantly increases oil production
   rates and reduces overall steam requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Athabasca bitumen upgrading via in situ combustion (ISC) and in situ
   upgrading technology (ISUT) was studied in the present work, addressing
   three aspects related to these processes: (I) monitoring techniques
   especially developed for getting distillation characteristics for
   products and their fractions, (II) studying how distillation properties
   depend on process setup experimental conditions, and (III) assessing the
   permanent upgrading levels achieved for products from both studied
   processes. High temperature simulated distillation (HTSD) techniques
   were conceived for getting analysis turnarounds of 1-2 weeks, instead of
   month spans required when relying on standard physical distillation
   methodologies. Developed monitoring procedures guaranteed sample
   integrity; i.e., volatile fractions (<230 degrees C, about <C13) were
   included in product upgrading mappings. ISC processing tested in pilot
   scale combustion tubes was observed to provide complex upgrading
   mappings and product fractions presenting varying conversion of vacuum
   residue during the tests, properties mostly depending on the particular
   experimental conditions set up for each test. ISUT pilot testing carried
   out in two-dimensional pilot rigs was found to provide varying vacuum
   residua conversion levels, achieving the desirable aimed values by
   controlling the reaction (residence) time as an adjustable parameter.
   Both studied process alternatives provided substantial permanent
   upgrading, i.e., produced light ends that improved flow-ability and
   increased the market value of the products.}},

Abstract = {{Asphaltenes surplus production in northern Alberta facilities as a
   result of heavy oil upgrading incentivizes searching for alternative
   processes to coking or gasification, with less environmental footprint
   and/or lower costs. Oxy-cracking of asphaltenes in liquid phase under
   alkali conditions could be a new approach to creating higher value
   products. In the present study, asphaltene particles/drops were
   solubilized in water with the ultimate intention of reducing their
   molecular weight, converting them to analogs of humic substances with
   potential applications as soil cofertilizers or other industrial
   applications. For evaluating the feasibility of solubilizing asphaltene
   particles by oxy-cracking, experiments were done in a batch reactor to
   study the parameters maximizing the solubilization toward liquid
   products: temperature, residence time, pressure, base effect,
   asphaltenes mass, and stirring speed. The results showed that
   temperature and residence time are the two parameters affecting reaction
   the most, being the optimum values 180-210 degrees C and 1-2 h,
   respectively. The intermediate product of asphaltenes oxy-cracking
   reaction is water-soluble asphaltenes (WSA), and the final product is
   CO2. The water solubilized products were found to contain organic
   carboxylic, carbonyl, phenolic, and sulfonic functions, responsible for
   their dissolution in water. At less severe conditions, WSA had
   characteristics similar to humic analogs; but with increasing reaction
   severity, products aromaticity increased and lower molecular weight
   components (fulvic analogs) were formed.}},

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{The solubilized asphaltene in water (SAW) was prepared by
   low-temperature oxidation in aqueous phase and used as a feedstock of
   hydroprocessing reaction. Hydroprocessing experiments were carried out
   in a 100 mL batch reactor within the temperature range of 280-320
   degrees C in the presence of presulfided NiMo/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst. A
   lumped kinetic model with four components including water-soluble
   fractions, water-insoluble fractions, liquid hydrocarbons, and gas
   products was proposed, which accurately predicted the experimental
   results. The activation energy of global reaction was calculated to be
   83 kJ/mol. At 320 degrees C, the liquid hydrocarbons yield increased
   around 8\% by prolonging the residence time from 1 to 6 h. For 3 h
   residence time, by increasing the reaction temperature from 280 to 320
   degrees C, the liquid yield was increased 5\% and the conversion was
   enhanced by 8\%. Increasing the reaction temperature affected the
   quality of products; that is, liquid hydrocarbons with lower boiling
   point distribution were obtained at higher reaction temperatures. At 320
   degrees C, phenol derivative products disappeared, indicating the
   progress of deoxygenation at higher reaction temperatures. Fourier
   transform infrared analyses confirmed that disappearance of carboxylate
   functional groups through decarboxylation or protonation was the main
   reason for the production of water-insoluble fractions after the
   hydroprocessing. An extended Henry's law with gamma-phi approach was
   implemented to predict the thermodynamics status of the system at
   reaction conditions. The occurrence of reaction in the liquid phase was
   confirmed, where at 320 degrees C more than 80 wt \% of water remained
   in the liquid phase and the liquid level in the reactor increased 25\%.}},

   variable-pitch wind turbines with unmodeled dynamics}},
Journal = {{ISA TRANSACTIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{233-241}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel synthesis of Nussbaum-type functions, and an
   adaptive radial-basis function neural network is proposed to design
   controllers for variable-speed, variable-pitch wind turbines. Dynamic
   equations of the wind turbine are highly nonlinear, uncertain, and
   affected by unknown disturbance sources. Furthermore, the dynamic
   equations are non-affine with respect to the pitch angle, which is a
   control input. To address these problems, a Nussbaum-type function,
   along with a dynamic control law are adopted to resolve the non-affine
   nature of the equations. Moreover, an adaptive radial-basis function
   neural network is designed to approximate non-parametric uncertainties.
   Further, the closed-loop system is made robust to unknown disturbance
   sources, where no prior knowledge of disturbance bound is assumed in
   advance. Finally, the Lyapunov stability analysis is conducted to show
   the stability of the entire closed-loop system. In order to verify
   analytical results, a simulation is presented and the results are
   compared to both a PI and an existing adaptive controllers. (C) 2016

Pages = {{99-105}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Footwear insoles/orthotics alter variables associated
   withmusculoskeletal injury; however, their clinical effectiveness is
   inconclusive. One explanation for this is the possibility that control
   conditions may actually produce biomechanical changes that induce
   clinical responses. The purpose of this study was to compare
   insole/orthotic control conditions to identify if variables at the
   ground, ankle and knee that are associated with injury {[}1 not equal
   TD\$ DIF] are altered relative to what participants would normally
   experience in their own shoes. Gait analysis was performed on 15
   participants during walking and running while wearing (1) their own
   shoes, (2) \# 1 with a 3 mm flat insole, (3) a standardized shoe, and
   (4) \# 3 with a 3 mm flat insole, where external knee adduction moments,
   external knee adduction angular impulses, internal ankle inversion
   moments, and vertical ground reaction force loading rates were
   determined. Conditions 2- 4 were expressed as percent changes relative
   to condition 1, and tests of proportions assessed if there {[}4 not
   equal TD\$DIF] were a significant number of individuals experiencing a
   biomechanically relevant change for each variable. Repeated- measures
   ANOVAs were used to identify group differences between conditions. The
   majority of movement- footwear- variable combinations contained a
   proportion of individuals experiencing biomechanically relevant changes
   compared to condition 1 that was significantly greater than the expected
   proportion of 20\%. No systematic differences were found between
   conditions. This suggests that conditions 2- 4 may alter biomechanics
   relative to baseline for many participants, but not in a consistent way
   across participants. It is recommended that participant's own footwear
   be used as control conditions in future trials where biomechanics are
   primary variables of interest. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{An application of H-bridges that enable soft start and power factor
   correction of cage induction machines is presented. The proposed power
   electronics employs floating capacitor H-bridges connected in series
   with utility grid and a cage induction motor to provide series voltage
   compensation. Injecting a series voltage in each phase, the proposed
   system can be used to control the motor voltage during starting and
   hence limit the motor starting current. In addition, an algorithm is
   proposed to accurately predict the worst case scenario for bridge dc
   capacitor voltage before motor starting. Thus, a dc capacitor
   overvoltage problem can be avoided. Experimental results show that the
   proposed system can successfully soft start a standard squirrel cage
   induction machine under different modes and load conditions. A simple
   representation of the worst case scenario for dc capacitor voltage

Abstract = {{In this paper, a class of cross-coupled differential filters is
   presented. The filters implemented are second order, using two
   transistors cross-coupled surrounded by passive RLC components. The
   input of each filter is differential and so is its output. Biasing of
   each filter is straightforward, and the stability of the filters is
   examined. Several of the filters were built experimentally using
   discrete components and simulated using SPICE in a 0.18 mu m Taiwan
   Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) complementary metal-oxide
   semiconductor (CMOS) process, confirming the validity of the filters.

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Sustainability of modern civil engineering structures is the broad
   objective of the present paper. Infrastructures should be designed and
   built to be used satisfactorily over longer life spans without collapse
   or deterioration requiring major repair. Progress in materials,
   analysis, and design makes it possible to achieve a life span for
   concrete infrastructures of 100-125 years. An appropriate life span can
   be a contractual requirement for all civil engineering infrastructures.
   For these objectives, provisions for lasting satisfactory serviceability
   are increasingly adopted in codes. Only deficient serviceability or
   strength, developing gradually over a number of years, is discussed.
   Lessons to be learned from collapse, excessive deflection and cracking
   of bridges, and intolerable sagging of slab floor are discussed. The
   paper presents limited means to control long-term deflection and
   cracking of bridges, including slab bridges and flat-plate floors; other
   recommendations that enhance sustainability of future infrastructures
   are put forward.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a review of recent advances in the development of
   methods for segmentation of the breast boundary and the pectoral muscle
   in mammograms. Regardless of improvement of imaging technology, accurate
   segmentation of the breast boundary and detection of the pectoral muscle
   are still challenging tasks for image processing algorithms. In this
   paper, we discuss problems related to mammographic image preprocessing
   and accurate segmentation. We review specific methods that were commonly
   used in most of the techniques proposed for segmentation of mammograms
   and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. Comparative analysis of
   the methods reported on is made difficult by variations in the datasets
   and procedures of evaluation used by the authors. We attempt to overcome
   some of these limitations by trying to compare methods which used the
   same dataset and have some similarities in approaches to the breast
   boundary segmentation and detection of the pectoral muscle. In this
   paper, we will address the most often used methods for segmentation such
   as thresholding, morphology, region growing, active contours, and
   wavelet filtering. These methods, or their combinations, are the ones
   most used in the last decade by the majority of work published in this
   image processing domain.}},

Abstract = {{The dispersion of plumes released from stacks depends on wind speed,
   plume emission rate, stack height, and other meteorological and stack
   variables. Plume rise is an important aspect of plume dispersion because
   it increases the apparent release height, which leads to lower
   ground-level concentrations. Plume rise linked with flare combustion has
   received only minimal attention in the literature to date, despite its
   importance. This study develops a numerical model of plume rise with
   flare combustion based on material, heat, mass, and momentum balances.
   The basis of the model is a numerical plume rise model used in CALPUFF
   to model plume rise of large buoyant area sources, and is also used in
   PRIME (plume rise model enhancements), which models building downwash.
   The proposed model considers the reaction kinetics. The competition
   between CH4 and CO combustion causes a modification of the temperature
   profile of up to 3\% in comparison with an instantaneous reaction model.
   Moreover, emissivity, which plays an important role in the heat
   conservation equations but which was only parameterized in an earlier
   work, is calculated more directly to increase the accuracy of the model.
   It was found that soot is the main contributor to flame emissivity.
   Finally, the air dispersion model CALPUFF was run according to the
   proposed flare model and an empirical flare model by Beychok to compare
   results of the models. This new flare method is sufficiently simple to
   be embedded into air dispersion modelling software such as CALPUFF.}},

Abstract = {{Thermally induced changes in surface wettability, dewetting behavior,

   switching of the surface wettability of 55 nm and thinner films from
   hydrophilic to super-hydrophobic. Thickness dependence of this behavior
   is observed with higher annealing temperature required for lower
   thickness films, indicating highly restrictive mobility of Nafion (R)
   ionomer as film thickness decreases. Dewetting is only observed for 4-nm
   thin film. Significant suppression in proton conductivity upon thermal
   annealing was noted. Similarly, two other bulk properties, water uptake
   and swelling, were found to decrease upon annealing. This work reports a
   systematic examination of the thickness dependence of thermally induced
   changes in both surface and bulk properties of ultra-thin Nafion (R).

Abstract = {{We build upon previous work that assigns passengers to a specific

   luggage they carry aboard the plane. In particular, we propose a mixed

   that the proposed approach results in a reduction of the time to
   complete the boarding of the plane. The improvement is greatest when
   many luggage are carried onto the plane. The optimal distribution of
   luggage assigns passengers with few carry-on bags to the rows of the

Abstract = {{Background and objective: Injury of knee joint cartilage may result in
   pathological vibrations between the articular surfaces during extension
   and flexion motions. The aim of this paper is to analyze and quantify
   vibroarthrographic (VAG) signal irregularity associated with articular
   cartilage degeneration and injury in the patellofemoral joint.
   Methods: The symbolic entropy (SyEn), approximate entropy (ApEn), fuzzy
   entropy (FuzzyEn), and the mean, standard deviation, and
   root-mean-squared (RMS) values of the envelope amplitude, were utilized
   to quantify the signal fluctuations associated with articular cartilage
   pathology of the patellofemoral joint. The quadratic discriminant
   analysis (QDA), generalized logistic regression analysis (GLRA), and
   support vector machine (SVM) methods were used to perform signal pattern
   classifications.
   Results: The experimental results showed that the patients with
   cartilage pathology (CP) possess larger SyEn and ApEn, but smaller
   FuzzyEn, over the statistical significance level of the Wilcoxon
   rank-sum test (p < 0.01), than the healthy subjects (HS). The mean,
   standard deviation, and RMS values computed from the amplitude
   difference between the upper and lower signal envelopes are also
   consistently and significantly larger (p < 0.01) for the group of CP
   patients than for the HS group. The SVM based on the entropy and
   envelope amplitude features can provide superior classification
   performance as compared with QDA and GLRA, with an overall accuracy of
   0.8356, sensitivity of 0.9444, specificity of 0.8, Matthews correlation
   coefficient of 0.6599, and an area of 0.9212 under the receiver
   operating characteristic curve.
   Conclusions: The SyEn, ApEn, and FuzzyEn features can provide useful
   information about pathological VAG signal irregularity based on
   different entropy metrics. The statistical parameters of signal envelope
   amplitude can be used to characterize the temporal fluctuations related
   to the cartilage pathology. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the synthesis of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) with diameters in
   the range 10-20 nm using two phytochemicals, gallic acid and
   protocatechuic acid, which have similar chemical structures but subtle
   differences in their chemical potentials. This subtlety in their
   potential difference improves the control over the reduction of Ag
   precursors such that their composition and concentration are optimized
   for both the nucleation and growth steps of NP synthesis. Both steps
   were carefully monitored using UV -vis spectrophotometry and electron
   microscopy. The surface interaction energy of the phytochemicals on the
   NPs was characterized using computational simulation, and
   electrochemical analysis was performed to calculate the chemical
   reducibility of the phytochemicals to Ag+ ions by cyclic voltammetry. A
   plausible mechanism of size control was suggested. This novel and
   valuable method to control the size and the size distribution of Ag NPs
   enables new applications in materials science, biomedical science, and
   chemical sensor development. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an analytical formula for the effective thermal
   conductivity of porous media saturated with two immiscible fluids is
   derived for a wide range of pore sizes. The method applied to derive the
   formulas for the effective thermal conductivity is based on the
   mesoscopic adaptation of the hybrid approach by taking into account the
   influence of different types of scattering events on the interfaces
   between fluids and grain phase. The influence of surface roughness on
   the effective thermal conductivity is explored. Analysis of the results
   demonstrates a very good agreement of the theoretical approach with
   available experimental data. It is also observed that as the surface
   roughness increases, the heat carrier confinement at the grain surface
   increases and consequently the effective thermal conductivity decreases.

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to test in vitro a drug delivery system
   that combines nanoencapsulation and ion-tophoresis for the transdermal
   delivery of lipophilic model drug using poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)
   (PLGA) as the carrier polymer. Negatively charged fluorescent
   nanoparticles loaded with negatively charged flufenamic acid were
   prepared. The colloidal properties of the particles were stable under
   iontophoretic current (constant, pulsed and alternating) profiles and in
   contact with skin barrier. The release of the drug from the particles
   was not affected by iontophoresis and remained always limited
   (approximate to 50\%), leading to significantly lower transdermal fluxes
   across human epidermis and full thickness porcine skin compared to
   respective free drug formulation. From nanoparticles, pulsed current
   profile resulted in comparable or higher fluxes compared to constant
   current profile although fluorescence imaging was not able to confirm
   deeper distribution of nanoparticles in skin. Based on our results,
   there is no clear advantage with respect to drug permeation from
   nanoencapsulating flufenamic acid into PLGA nanoparticles compared to
   free drug formulation, either in passive or iontophoretic delivery
   regimens. However, pulsed current iontophoresis could be an effective
   alternative instead of traditional constant current iontophoresis to
   enhance transdermal permeation of drugs from nanoencapsulated
   formulations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the principle of capillarity and the mechanism of a
   wetting film in porous media are applied in designing coalescence media.
   Water-wet porous particles are used for the first time in a coalescing
   column to enhance the separation of water from water-in-heavy oil
   emulsions. Experimental results show that this type of particles can
   remain water-wet in an oil environment and can significantly enhance the
   coalescence of water droplets in water-in-heavy oil emulsions. The
   coalescing column test results show that the flow of the emulsion
   through the 10 cm coalescing column reduced water content from 44.37\%
   to 21.54\% at 80 degrees C, without using a demulsifier. The coalescing
   column can further reduce the water content beyond what was reached in
   gravity separation using a high dosage of demulsifier. At a fixed
   temperature of 80 degrees C, when the dosage of the selected demulsifier
   changed from 50 to 100 to 150 ppm, water content was reduced to 10.49\%,
   1.32\%, and 0.64\%, respectively, with the use of a 10 cm coalescing
   column. These results indicate that the effect of adding a coalescing
   column to water separation from water-in-heavy oil emulsions is
   significant, as compared to using only a demulsifier in gravity
   separation. More importantly, flow through the coalescing column could
   reduce the water content in the heavy oil to a very low level (<1.0\%)
   and, at the same time, reduce the consumption of demulsifier. (C) 2016

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Abstract = {{In recent years it has been shown that the therapeutic benefits of human
   mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (hMSCs) in the Central Nervous System
   (CNS) are mainly attributed to their secretome. The implementation of
   computer-controlled suspension bioreactors has shown to be a viable
   route for the expansion of these cells to large numbers. As hMSCs
   actively respond to their culture environment, there is the hypothesis
   that one can modulate its secretome through their use. Herein, we
   present data indicating that the use of computer-controlled suspension
   bioreactors enhanced the neuroregulatory profile of hMSCs secretome.
   Indeed, higher levels of in vitro neuronal differentiation and NOTCH1
   expression in human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) were observed when
   these cells were incubated with the secretome of dynamically cultured
   hMSCs. A similar trend was also observed in the hippocampal dentate
   gyrus (DG) of rat brains where, upon injection, an enhanced neuronal and
   astrocytic survival and differentiation, was observed. Proteomic
   analysis also revealed that the dynamic culturing of hMSCs increased the
   secretion of several neuroregulatory molecules and miRNAs present in
   hMSCs secretome. In summary, the appropriate use of dynamic culture
   conditions can represent an important asset for the development of
   future neuro-regenerative strategies involving the use of hMSCs
   secretome.}},

Title = {{Novel insights on initial water mobility: Its effects on steam-assisted
   gravity drainage performance}},

Abstract = {{Steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) is a primary commercial in-situ
   thermal recovery method for oil sands/bitumen in Alberta, Canada.
   Evidence of initial water mobility during the SAGD processes has been
   observed by previous studies, yet little research has been done on its
   effects on SAGD performance. In this study, initial water movement ahead
   of the steam chamber is investigated and its effects on the steam
   chamber development, as well as well production performance are
   quantified. Initial water mobility is firstly classified into two
   categories (low and high) based on the shapes of their steam chambers.
   Results show that initial water mobility can change the shape of steam
   chamber, pressure distribution in the reservoir and the steam condensate
   flow pattern along steam chamber edge. Cumulative oil production in nine
   years for the low initial water mobility scenario is 18.1\% higher than
   that of the immobile initial water scenario due to the convective heat
   transfer induced by initial water flow ahead of the steam chamber. On
   the other hand, cumulative oil production in nine years of the high
   initial water scenario is 34.6\% lower than that of immobile scenario.
   For the adjacent well pairs located in the same pad, compared to
   immobile initial water case, low initial water mobility case with the
   same injection pressure has the highest NPV, while high initial water
   mobility has a negative impact on SAGD performance. An injection
   pressure difference of only 200 kPa for the high initial water mobility
   case can reduce NPV by 40\%. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Type 1 Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage
   disease, affecting bone metabolism, structure and strength. Current bone
   assessment methods are not ideal. Semi-quantitative MRI scoring is
   unreliable, not standardized, and only evaluates bone marrow. DXA BMD is
   also used but is a limited predictor of bone fragility/fracture risk.
   Our purpose was to measure trabecular bone micro architecture, as a
   biomarker of bone disease severity, in type 1 GD individuals with
   different GD genotypes and to apply machine learning based analytics to
   discriminate between GD patients and healthy individuals. Micro-MR
   imaging of the distal radius was performed on 20 type 1 GD patients and
   10 healthy controls (HC). Fifteen stereological and textural measures
   (STM) were calculated from the MR images. General linear models
   demonstrated significant differences between GD and HC, and GD
   genotypes. Stereological measures, main contributors to the first two
   principal components (PCs), explained similar to 50\% of data variation
   and were significantly different between males and females. Subsequent
   PCs textural measures were significantly different between GD patients
   and HC individuals. Textural measures also significantly differed
   between GD genotypes, and distinguished between GD patients with normal
   and pathologic DXA scores. PCA and SVM predictive analyses discriminated
   between GD and HC with maximum accuracy of 73\% and area under ROC curve
   of 0.79. Trabecular STM differences can be quantified between GD
   patients and HC, and GD sub-types using micro-MRI and machine learning
   based analytics. Work is underway to expand this approach to evaluate GD
   disease burden and treatment efficacy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Five organic pi-conjugated small molecules with bithiophene-phthalimide
   backbones bearing alkyl chains of different symmetry, length and
   branching character were synthesized using optimized microwave and
   direct heteroarylation protocols. The chosen alkyl chains were
   1-ethylpropyl, 1-methylbutyl, pentyl, hexyl and octyl. A sixth compound
   was also synthesized replacing the phthalimide terminal units with
   octylnaphthatimide for additional scope. Through the thorough analysis
   of both thermal and optical properties and the investigation of
   self-assembly tendencies by single crystal X-ray diffraction and
   variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry it is evident that alkyl side
   chains and building block size influence many facets of material
   properties. Within this class of materials the 1-ethylpropyl derivative
   exhibited the most unique behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{A co-design methodology for antenna miniaturisation with an integrated
   radio frequency (RF) amplifier is proposed for power-efficient and
   compact RF front-ends. This approach relaxes the standalone antenna
   matching requirement which is of interest in miniaturised antenna
   design. The detailed design and measurement procedure is presented and
   the concept is demonstrated with two examples for both narrowband and
   wideband scenarios considering transmitting and receiving front-ends.
   The amplifiers and the antennas are co-designed so that optimum
   performance is achieved in terms of gain, noise figure and efficiency.
   The antenna has the size of 0.033(0)(2) at 2.45 GHz. It is miniaturised
   from its natural resonance frequency of 3.5-2.45 GHz which provides 51\%
   of size reduction. The minimum bandwidth of the integrated antenna is
   found to be 37 and 150 MHz, respectively, for the narrowband and
   wideband designs. The active integrated antenna (AIA) efficiency is more
   than 47\% when operating in the band of 2.45-2.6 GHz. The gain and noise
   figure of the AIA systems are optimised along with the antenna
   performance and found to be >10 dB and <2 dB, respectively. Measurement
   results are presented which are in well agreement with the design
   procedure and simulations.}},

Abstract = {{A new graphical procedure is proposed to estimate the interface

   method to synthetic and experimental pressure-decay data shows that the
   estimated parameters are in agreement with those reported in the

Abstract = {{The combination of Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) with Calcium
   Looping (CaL) using integrated pellets is an alternative CO2 capture
   process to the current amine-based sorbent processes, but the pellets

   behavior of CaO, CuO and CuO/CaO integrated pellets used for multiple
   (16-20) cycles in a thermogravimetric analyzer was studied. The impact
   of thermal treatment and the presence of steam on the deactivation were
   also investigated. Nitrogen physisorption and scanning electron
   microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray analysis were used to characterize
   the pellets. The analysis revealed significant migration of the copper
   to the surface of the composite pellets, which likely suppressed
   carbonation capacity by reducing the accessibility of the CaO. While
   thermal pre-treatment and steam addition enhanced the performance of the
   base CaO pellets, the former led to cracks in the pellets. In contrast,
   thermal pretreatment of the CuO/CaO composite pellets resulted in worse
   CLC and CaL performance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new control scheme for the problem of a space
   robot after capturing an unknown tumbling target, such as space debris.
   Robotic capturing the target may destabilize the base of spacecraft and
   control torque is bounded which would affect the performance of attitude
   control system. To stabilize the base with bounded torque in postcapture
   scenario, a new control scheme which utilizes the control torque to
   balance angular momentum and motion of the manipulator to compensate
   limitation of the torque, is proposed. Considering uncertainties of the
   target, parameter identification technique for tumbling target with
   linear momentum is utilized to correct parameters of the controller. To
   verify validity and feasibility of the proposed concept, a planar space
   robot capturing small, medium and large target with or without linear
   momentum is studied. The results show that the whole system is
   stabilized finally and all the inertial parameters of the target
   converge to their real values. (C) 2016 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a therapeutic intervention used for a
   variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders, but its mechanism of
   action is not well understood. It is known that DBS modulates neural
   activity which changes metabolic demands and thus the cerebral
   circulation state. However, it is unclear whether there are correlations
   between electrophysiological, hemodynamic and behavioral changes and
   whether they have any implications for clinical benefits. In order to
   investigate these questions, we present a miniaturized system for
   spectroscopic imaging of brain hemodynamics. The system consists of a
   144 x 144, 9.5-mu m pixel pitch, high-sensitivity, analog-output CMOS
   imager fabricated in a standard 0.35 mu m CMOS process, along with a
   miniaturized imaging system comprising illumination, focusing,
   analog-to-digital conversion and mu SD card based data storage. This
   enables stand alone operation without a computer, nor electrical or
   fiberoptic tethers. To achieve high sensitivity, the pixel uses a
   capacitive transimpedance amplifier (CTIA). The nMOS transistors are in
   the pixel while pMOS transistors are column-parallel, resulting in a
   fill factor (FF) of 26\%. Running at 60 fps and exposed to 470 nm light,
   the CMOS imager has a minimum detectable intensity of 2.3 nW/cm(2), a
   maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 49 dB at 2.45 mu W/cm(2) leading
   to a dynamic range (DR) of 61 dB while consuming 167 mu A from a 3.3 V
   supply. In anesthetized rats, the system was able to detect temporal,
   spatial and spectral hemodynamic changes in response to DBS.}},

   Reclamation: Membrane Fouling}},
Journal = {{MEMBRANES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The membrane bioreactor (MBR) has emerged as an efficient compact
   technology for municipal and industrial wastewater treatment. The major
   drawback impeding wider application of MBRs is membrane fouling, which
   significantly reduces membrane performance and lifespan, resulting in a
   significant increase in maintenance and operating costs. Finding
   sustainable membrane fouling mitigation strategies in MBRs has been one
   of the main concerns over the last two decades. This paper provides an
   overview of membrane fouling and studies conducted to identify
   mitigating strategies for fouling in MBRs. Classes of foulants,
   including biofoulants, organic foulants and inorganic foulants, as well
   as factors influencing membrane fouling are outlined. Recent research
   attempts on fouling control, including addition of coagulants and
   adsorbents, combination of aerobic granulation with MBRs, introduction
   of granular materials with air scouring in the MBR tank, and quorum
   quenching are presented. The addition of coagulants and adsorbents shows
   a significant membrane fouling reduction, but further research is needed
   to establish optimum dosages of the various coagulants/adsorbents.
   Similarly, the integration of aerobic granulation with MBRs, which
   targets biofoulants and organic foulants, shows outstanding filtration
   performance and a significant reduction in fouling rate, as well as
   excellent nutrients removal. However, further research is needed on the
   enhancement of long-term granule integrity. Quorum quenching also offers
   a strong potential for fouling control, but pilot-scale testing is
   required to explore the feasibility of full-scale application.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental verification of a prediction model

   examined using experimental drained triaxial test results of three

   process is applied based on numerical modeling of the testing conditions
   in order to evaluate the pure sand properties. Based on these
   properties, the model forecasts the stress-stain curves for different
   hydrate saturations, based on an advanced hydrate simulator. Although
   the model does not show a fair forecast with ``ice-seeding{''} hydrate
   formation samples and for specimens tested under gas saturation, it
   predicts the mechanical behavior of samples with ``partly saturated{''}
   hydrate formation tested under water saturation.}},

Abstract = {{Mixtures of ethylene glycol and methanol (EG-MeOH) have been used as an
   analogue system (i.e., EG-MeOH/water) in recent experiments in the
   context of convective dissolution of CO2 in deep saline aquifers. We
   have conducted a linear stability analysis of a gravitationally unstable
   diffusive boundary layer as well as direct numerical simulation of
   convective mixing involved in dissolution of EG-MeOH species in water.
   We provide new evidences that EG-MeOH does not resemble the dynamics of
   convective instabilities and subsequent mixing associated with
   dissolution of CO2 in water. It is found that there are fundamental
   differences in the evolution of the buoyancy-driven instability and
   dynamics of convective mixing between CO2/water and a typical
   EG-MeOH/water analogue system. Our results show that for a constant
   Rayleigh number, the onset of convective instabilities for EG-MeOH/water
   can be different by an order of magnitude as compared with CO2/water. In
   addition, EG-MeOH/water system reveals different dynamics associated
   with the convective mixing as compared to CO2/water system. This study
   improves our understanding of the instability behavior of analogue
   systems, their proper selection, and motivates further experiments.}},

Title = {{Multi-skeleton model for top-down design of complex products}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Generally, there are two alternative design approaches available to
   engineers: bottom-up and top-down. Considering the sharp increase in the
   complexity of most mechanical products, the top-down design approach is
   more widely adopted in the development of complex products. However, in
   traditional top-down design process, design parameters are communicated
   through single-skeleton models, and design units are strongly coupled
   due to the multi-dimensional complexity of products. Toward this end, a
   new top-down design approach based on multi-skeleton model is proposed
   in this article. First, in accordance with different kinds of design
   parameters, three major skeleton models are defined, including location

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Soil exhibits creep behavior, in which the deformation of soil develops
   with time at a state of constant effective stress. A series of triaxial
   compression creep tests was performed on a saturated till to investigate
   the creep behavior at different effective stresses and strains of the
   samples. In the tests, the saturated till was allowed to creep in
   single, multiple, and stepwise stages. The dependency of creep rate of
   the saturated till on time was examined using the test data. It was
   found that the time-dependent creep rate models are incapable of
   describing the creep behavior of soil under the condition of
   multiple-stage creep, i.e., complex load conditions. A strain-dependent
   and stress-dependent creep model of the saturated till subject to
   triaxial compression was proposed. In the model, the creep rate of soil
   was formulated as a function of inelastic strain and effective stresses
   instead of time and effective stresses. This model could describe the
   dependencies of soil creep rate on time, strain, and effective stress
   observed in the triaxial compression creep tests. Test data obtained in
   the creep tests were used to verify the proposed model. Moreover, a
   methodology to accelerate the creep test for soil was developed. (C)

Journal = {{BIOMEDICAL MICRODEVICES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Nucleic acid based diagnostic techniques are routinely used for the
   detection of infectious agents. Most of these assays rely on nucleic
   acid extraction platforms for the extraction and purification of nucleic
   acids and a separate real-time PCR platform for quantitative nucleic
   acid amplification tests (NATs). Several microfluidic lab on chip (LOC)
   technologies have been developed, where mechanical and chemical methods
   are used for the extraction and purification of nucleic acids.
   Microfluidic technologies have also been effectively utilized for chip
   based real-time PCR assays. However, there are few examples of
   microfluidic systems which have successfully integrated these two key
   processes. In this study, we have implemented an electro-actuation based
   LOC micro-device that leverages multi-frequency actuation of samples and
   reagents droplets for chip based nucleic acid extraction and real-time,
   reverse transcription (RT) PCR (qRT-PCR) amplification from clinical
   samples. Our prototype micro-device combines chemical lysis with
   electric field assisted isolation of nucleic acid in a four channel
   parallel processing scheme. Furthermore, a four channel parallel qRT-PCR
   amplification and detection assay is integrated to deliver the
   sample-to-detection NAT chip. The NAT chip combines dielectrophoresis
   and electrostatic/electrowetting actuation methods with resistive
   micro-heaters and temperature sensors to perform chip based integrated
   NATs. The two chip modules have been validated using different panels of
   clinical samples and their performance compared with standard platforms.
   This study has established that our integrated NAT chip system has a
   sensitivity and specificity comparable to that of the standard platforms
   while providing up to 10 fold reduction in sample/reagent volumes.}},

Abstract = {{To predict variation in thoracic surgery workforce requirements with the
   introduction of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) for the
   treatment of early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
   Using Canadian census microdata and the Canadian Community Health
   Survey, a microsimulation model representing the national population was
   developed. The demand component simulates the incidence of lung cancer,
   incorporating the impact of computed tomography (CT) screening for
   high-risk individuals (> 30 pack-year smoking history; age 55-74 years).
   The supply component simulates the number of thoracic surgeons. SABR was
   introduced into the model to predict changes in the number of operable
   NSCLC cases per thoracic surgeon, modelling 30, 60 and 90\% compliance
   with SABR for Stage IA and then for both Stage IA and IB NSCLC.
   In the absence of SABR, the volume of operative NSCLC per surgeon
   increases by a peak of 49.4\% (by 2027) and then gradually declines to
   the present day volume by 2049. More dramatic decreases are seen with
   increasing compliance with SABR for Stage IA/IB NSCLCs. If the number of
   new surgeons entering the workforce per year were reduced by 33\%, the
   operative volume per surgeon would increase by a peak of 57.1\% (30\%
   Stage IA SABR compliance) and would decrease by up to 49.1\% (90\% Stage
   IA SABR compliance).
   With the implementation of SABR for treatment of early NSCLC, there
   would be a decrease in operative volume. The impact would depend on the
   stage of NSCLC for which SABR is recommended and on compliance. A
   national strategy for thoracic surgery workforce planning is necessary,
   given the complex interaction of CT screening and the treatment of
   medically operable early NSCLC with SABR.}},

Journal = {{EXPERIMENTS IN FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{As a follow-up to a previous proof-of-principle study, a novel
   Lagrangian pressure-extraction technique is analytically evaluated, and
   experimentally validated using dense 4D-PTV data. The technique is
   analytically evaluated using the semi-three-dimensional Taylor-Green
   vortex, and it is found that the Lagrangian technique out-performs the
   standard Eulerian technique when Dirichlet boundary conditions are
   enforced. However, the Lagrangian technique produces worse estimates of
   the pressure field when Neumann boundary conditions are enforced on
   boundaries with strong pressure gradients. The technique is
   experimentally validated using flow data obtained for the case of a
   free-falling, index-matched sphere at Re = 2100. The experimental data
   were collected using a four-camera particle tracking velocimetry
   measurement system, and processed using 4D-PTV. The pressure field is
   then extracted using both the Eulerian and Lagrangian techniques, and
   the resulting pressure fields are compared. Qualitatively, the pressure
   fields agree; however, quantitative differences are found with respect
   to the magnitude of the pressure minima on the side of the sphere.
   Finally, the pressuredrag coefficient is estimated using each technique,
   and the two techniques are found to be in very close agreement. A
   comparison to a reference value from literature confirms that the drag
   coefficient estimates are reasonable, demonstrating the validity of the
   technique.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new mixed-integer linear programming model for
   day-ahead self-scheduling of generating companies integrating the
   underlying ideas of robust optimization (RO) and stochastic programming
   (SP) to cope with the uncertainties of electricity market prices and
   availability/unavailability of units. The proposed hybrid approach
   models the uncertainty of electricity market prices by bounded intervals
   instead of probability distributions, aiming to derive a more tractable
   optimization model. Conservatism against uncertain electricity market
   prices is adjusted by a certain parameter named budget of robustness.
   Also, a renovated Markov chain approach considering the chance of return
   (i.e., return rate) for failed units, in addition to forced outage rate
   of units, in each hour of the scheduling period is introduced in this
   paper to produce a set of scenarios modeling the
   availability/unavailability of units. Therefore, the proposed hybrid
   self-scheduling approach benefits from both the tractability of RO and
   modeling accuracy of SP. The proposed approach is implemented on IEEE
   118-bus test system under different circumstances to illustrate its
   effectiveness compared to deterministic self-scheduling model as well as
   the models only employing RO or SP. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{This paper examined and compared the hydraulic and environmental
   performance of permeable interlocking pavers (PICPs), porous asphalt
   (PA), and porous concrete (PC) under cold climate conditions in Calgary,
   Alberta, Canada. Assessments were made of their hydraulic performance in
   terms of storm runoff reduction and surface infiltration capacity, and
   environmental performance in terms of the removal of several pollutants
   including total suspended solids (TSS), total nitrogen (TN), total
   phosphorous (TP) and, heavy metals: copper (Cu), lead (Pb), and zinc
   (Zn). Results from this paper demonstrated that PA, PC, and PICPs are
   all effective in mitigating storm runoff under cold climate conditions.
   Surface infiltration rate was substantially affected by winter sanding
   materials for PA, PC, and PICPs. Pressure washing was demonstrated to be
   able to partially restore surface infiltration rates for all three types
   of pavements. All pavement types in general have the same level of
   performance in removing TSS, TP, TN, and heavy metals. The removal of
   TSS, TP, and heavy metals appears to be independent of climatic
   conditions, whereas TN removal tends to decline with a decrease in
   pavement temperature. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of foaming on the

   spectroscopy analyses were carried out and compared with the pseudo-3D
   model. We also found that foaming via the leaching method improved the
   EMI shielding properties of the composites up to 24\%.}},

Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The tightly coupled strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS)/global
   position system (GPS) has been widely used. The system observability
   determines whether the system state can be estimated by a filter
   efficiently or not. In this paper, the observability analysis of a
   two-channel and a three-channel tightly coupled SINS/GPS are performed,
   respectively, during arbitrary translational maneuvers and angle
   maneuvers, where the translational maneuver and angle maneuver are
   modeled. A novel instantaneous observability matrix (IOM) based on a
   reconstructed psi-angle model is proposed to make the theoretical
   analysis simpler, which starts from the observability definition
   directly. Based on the IOM, a series of theoretical analysis are
   performed. Analysis results show that almost all kinds of translational
   maneuver and angle maneuver can make a three-channel system
   instantaneously observable, but there is no one translational maneuver
   or angle maneuver can make a two-channel system instantaneously
   observable. The system's performance is investigated when the system is
   not instantaneously observable. A series of simulation studies based on
   EKF are performed to confirm the analytic conclusions.}},

Title = {{An IMU Evaluation Method Using a Signal Grafting Scheme}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{As various inertial measurement units (IMUs) from different
   manufacturers appear every year, it is not affordable to evaluate every
   IMU through tests. Therefore, this paper presents an IMU evaluation
   method by grafting data from the tested IMU to the reference data from a
   higher-grade IMU. The signal grafting (SG) method has several benefits:
   (a) only one set of field tests with a higher-grade IMU is needed, and
   can be used to evaluate numerous IMUs. Thus, SG is effective and
   economic because all data from the tested IMU is collected in the lab;
   (b) it is a general approach to compare navigation performances of
   various IMUs by using the same reference data; and, finally, (c) through
   SG, one can first evaluate an IMU in the lab, and then decide whether to
   further test it. Moreover, this paper verified the validity of SG to
   both medium-and low-grade IMUs, and presents and compared two SG
   strategies, i.e., the basic-error strategy and the full-error strategy.
   SG provided results similar to field tests, with a difference of under
   5\% and 19.4\%-26.7\% for tested tactical-grade and MEMS IMUs.
   Meanwhile, it was found that dynamic IMU errors were essential to
   guarantee the effect of the SG method.}},

Title = {{Shape, texture and statistical features for classification of benign and

Journal = {{COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{73}},

Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) result in partial
   collapse of vertebral bodies. They usually are nontraumatic or occur
   with low-energy trauma in the elderly secondary to different etiologies,
   such as insufficiency fractures of bone fragility in osteoporosis
   (benign fractures) or vertebral metastasis (malignant fractures). Our
   study aims to classify VCFs in T1-weighted magnetic resonance images
   (MRI).
   Methods: We used the median sagittal planes of lumbar spine MRIs from 63
   patients (38 women and 25 men) previously diagnosed with VCFs. The
   lumbar vertebral bodies were manually segmented and statistical features
   of gray levels were computed from the histogram. We also extracted
   texture and shape features to analyze the contours of the vertebral
   bodies. In total, 102 lumbar VCFs (53 benign and 49 malignant) and 89
   normal lumbar vertebral bodies were analyzed. The k-nearest-neighbor
   method, a neural network with radial basis functions, and a naive Bayes
   classifier were used with feature selection. We compared the
   classification obtained by these classifiers with the final diagnosis of
   each case, including biopsy for the malignant fractures and clinical and
   laboratory follow up for the benign fractures.
   Results: The results obtained show an area under the receiver operating
   characteristic curve of 0.97 in distinguishing between normal and
   fractured vertebral bodies, and 0.92 in discriminating between benign
   and malignant fractures.
   Conclusions: The proposed classification methods based on shape,
   texture, and statistical features have provided high accuracy and may
   assist in the diagnosis of VCFs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{New Pathways for Asphaltenes Upgrading Using the Oxy-Cracking Process}},
Journal = {{ENERGY \& FUELS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{4596-4608}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Solvent deasphalting of the bottom of vacuum distillation columns
   (vacuum residue, VR) is a process practiced worldwide. In Northern
   Alberta, a solvent deasphalting plant was designed to process up to 4000
   tons/day of the asphaltenic pitch. Asphaltenes oxy-cracking in liquid
   phase could be a new approach to asphaltenes upgrading and conversion
   into valuable chemicals. Oxy-cracking is a combination of oxidation and
   cracking in basic aqueous media at moderate temperatures (170-225
   degrees C) and pressures (300-500 psi). This process could act very
   selectively producing smaller amounts of greenhouse gases like CO2, thus
   being considered environmentally friendly. In this work, a mild
   oxy-cracking treatment of C-5-asphaltenes solid from Athabasca vacuum
   residue was investigated. The reaction kinetics and possible reaction
   mechanism for C-5-asphaltenes oxycracking in water under alkali
   conditions were studied. Products solubilized under different severities
   were characterized using Fourier transform infrared and nuclear magnetic
   resonance spectroscopies, simulated distillation, elemental analysis,
   and ultraviolet visible spectrophotometry to investigate the structure
   of solubilized products and changes in asphaltenes structures after the
   reaction. A model based on sequential-parallel reactions from the
   asphaltenes to water-soluble products and CO2 was found to describe the
   process successfully. Products of oxidized functionalities like
   carboxylic acids, their salts, methyl ethers and esters, and
   sulfur-oxidized forms plus phenolics were determined as the most
   significant fractions soluble in water. Solubilization of asphaltenes in
   water could also decrease challenges regarding facilities and pipelines
   plugging.}},

Abstract = {{While quality management systems are familiar to industries for

   In step 1, an existing design is analyzed, and the associations between
   design entities are captured in three types of relational matrices:
   requirements and metrics, metrics and components, and functions and
   components. In step 2, the mapping between requirements and functions
   are determined via matrix multiplications, and then a morphological
   chart is established to generate possible design concepts. In step 3,
   the generated concepts are evaluated using Pugh charts via the delegated
   engineering metrics. A hair dryer has been selected as an application to
   demonstrate the proposed method for supporting eco-design.}},

Abstract = {{Product architecture can influence different aspects of product
   lifecycle including manufacturing, assembly, and supply chain. The
   purpose of this article is to employ hierarchical cluster analysis for
   developing product architecture to support product variety. Design
   structure matrix is used to visualize and analyze product architecture
   in view of product modules, overlapping modules, and bus components. The
   proposed method for design structure matrix clustering consists of three
   phases. The first phase is component filtering to identify components
   that should be classified as bus components. The second phase is
   approximate structure formation that preliminarily organizes similar
   components to form a diagonal matrix. The third phase is partitioning
   analysis that finalizes the modules' boundary to yield the structured
   matrix as the solution of design structure matrix clustering. To examine
   the solution's quality, minimum description length from literature is
   used. Then, the proposed method is demonstrated via two literature
   examples and compared with the solutions by the manual and genetic
   algorithm approaches. One unique advantage of the proposed method is
   that the user can obtain and inspect the approximate structure in view
   of the diagonal matrix before finalizing the structured solution (e.g.
   estimate the number of modules).}},

Abstract = {{Tracking mobile nodes in dynamic and noisy conditions of industrial
   environments has provided a paradigm for many issues inherent in the
   area of distributed control systems in general and wireless sensor
   networks in particular. Due to the dynamic nature of the industrial
   environments, a practical tracking system is required that is adaptable
   to the changes in the environment. More specifically, given the limited
   resources of wireless nodes and the challenges created by harsh
   industrial environments there is a need for a technique that can modify
   the configuration of the system on the fly as new wireless nodes are
   added to the network and obsolete ones are removed. To address these
   issues, two cluster-based tracking systems, one static and the other
   dynamic, are proposed to organize the overall network field into a set
   of tracking zones, each composed of a sink node and a set of
   corresponding anchor nodes. To manage the wireless nodes activities and
   inter and intra cluster communications, an agent-based technique is
   employed. To compare the architectures, we report on a set of
   experiments performed in JADE (Java Agent Development Environment). In
   these experiments, we compare two agent-based approaches (dynamic and
   static) for managing clusters of wireless sensor nodes in a distributed
   tracking system. The experimental results corroborate the efficiency of
   the static clusters versus the robustness and effectiveness of the
   dynamic clusters.}},

Abstract = {{This study explored the feasibility of using residual biomass to both
   mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and remediate water contaminated
   by hydrocarbons. Using produced (process-affected) water from Canada's
   oil sands operations as a case study, activated biochar (ACB) was found
   to have a higher affinity to organics than activated coal and removed 75
   \% of total organic carbon (TOC) from produced water in steam-assisted
   gravity drainage (SAGD) operations or 90 \% of the TOC from synthetic
   tailings (ST) water sample. Up to 6 Tg dry biomass year(-1) would be
   required to treat the waters associated with the 93 x 10(6)-m(3) of
   bitumen recovered per year. Landfilling the spent ACB and flaring any
   biogas produced were estimated to provide a greater GHG benefit than the
   combustion of the biochar + organics for heat to offset natural gas
   demand. Net costs for the ACB were about 13.84 \$ m(-3) bitumen for SAGD
   operations and 1.76 \$ m(-3) bitumen for mining operations. The values
   for mining operations justify further work to create a value chain that
   will integrate bioprocesses into the fossil fuel industry.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of particle
   size and surface acidity of synthesized silica gel nanoparticles on the
   inhibition of formation damage caused by asphaltene
   precipitation/deposition. Silica gel nanoparticles were synthesized
   through the sol gel method, and their characterization was performed via
   N-2 physisorption at -196 degrees C, field emission scanning electron
   microscopy (FESEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements, and NH3
   temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). The size of the synthesized
   nanoparticles ranged from 11 to 240 nm. The ability of the nanoparticles
   to adsorb asphaltenes and to reduce asphaltene self-association was
   evaluated using batch-mode experiments. The kinetics of asphaltene
   aggregate growth in the presence and absence of nanoparticles were
   evaluated using DLS measurements in different Heptol solutions. The
   smallest nanoparticles (11 nm) had the highest adsorptive capacity for
   n-C(7)asphaltenes among the nanoparticles studied. Therefore, these
   nanoparticles were modified using acid, base, and neutral treatments,
   which showed the following order SllA >> S11B similar or equal to SiN
   similar or equal to S11 according to the n-C-7 asphaltene affinity and
   the reduction of its mean aggregate size in the bulk phase. The surface
   acidity values obtained through of temperature-programmed desorption
   test ranged from 1.07 and 1.32 mmol/g. In general, the asphaltene
   self-association was reduced to a higher degree as the amount of
   adsorbed asphaltene increased. Additionally, in this study, the
   performance of a nanofluid treatment was tested under flow,conditions in
   porous media under typical reservoir conditions using the nanoparticles
   with the best performance in batch-mode experiments. Indeed, nanofluid
   treatment with silica nanoparticles increased the effective permeability
   to oil and enhanced the oil recovery with an increase in the recovery
   factor of 11\% under the conditions reported here. This approach has the
   major benefit of being scalable to a producing field, and the study
   provides an understanding of the roles of size and surface acidity of
   silica nanoparticles in the wettability alteration and inhibition of
   formation damage caused by asphaltenes and their influences on
   asphaltene aggregate size in the oil matrix and the adsorbed phases.}},

Abstract = {{Small wind turbines are often used in remote locations, making them
   difficult and expensive to repair. This suggests the need for remote
   condition monitoring and fault diagnosis which has not been used
   extensively for small turbines. In order to investigate small direct
   drive wind turbine generators working at variable speed and develop new
   condition monitoring and fault diagnosis techniques, a test facility
   based on a 500W permanent magnet generator was built. The investigation
   concentrated on mechanical faults which include ball bearing outer race
   defect and a rotor imbalance. Electrical load imbalance was also
   investigated. Imbalance detection was performed through wavelet power
   spectrum analysis of vibration signals. Three time-frequency analysis
   techniques were performed on vibration signals and performances are
   compared. These were short time Fourier transforms, continuous wavelet
   transform, and order analysis. Order analysis proved to be a simple,
   intuitive, and reliable technique for vibration analysis under variable
   speed.}},

   China I: Water-soluble ions and carbonaceous fractions}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{135}},
Pages = {{20-30}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{During the past decade, huge research resources have been devoted into
   studies of air pollution in China, which generated abundant datasets on
   emissions and pollution characterization. Due to the complex nature of
   air pollution as well as the limitations of each individual
   investigating approach, the published results were sometimes perplexing
   and even contradicting. This research adopted a multi-method approach to
   investigate region-specific air pollution characteristics and sources in
   China, results obtained using different analytical and receptor modeling
   methods were inter-compared for validation and interpretation. A
   year-round campaign was completed for comprehensive characterization of
   PM2.5 over four key emission regions: Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH),
   Yangzi River Delta (YRD), Pearl River Delta (PRD), and Sichuan Basin
   (SB). Atmospheric PM2.5 samples were collected from 10/2012 to 08/2013
   at four regional sites, located on the diffusion paths of air masses
   from their corresponding megacities (i.e., Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou,
   and Chengdu). The annual average PM2.5 mass concentrations showed
   distinct regional difference, with the highest observed at BTH and
   lowest at PRD site. Nine water-soluble ions together contributed 33-41\%
   of PM2.5 mass, with three dominant ionic species being SO42-, NO3-, NHt,
   and carbonaceous particulate matter contributed 16-23\% of PM2.5 mass.
   This implied that combustion and secondary formation were the main
   sources for PM2.5 in China. In addition, SO42-, NO3-, NH4+, and
   carbonaceous components (OC, EC) showed clear seasonal patterns with the
   highest concentration occurring in winter while the lowest in summer.
   Principal component analysis performed on aerosol data revealed that
   vehicular emissions, coal/biomass combustion, industry source, soil dust
   as well as secondary formation were the main potential sources for the
   ionic components of PM2.5. The characteristic chemical species combined
   with back trajectory analysis indicated that BTH was heavily influenced
   by air masses originating from Mongolia and North China Plain regions,
   whereas SB suffered from both local emissions of Sichuan Basin and
   biomass burning via long-range transport from South Asia. Sourcing
   conclusions from this study will be compared, validated and interpreted
   with those obtained using organic molecular marker and carbon isotope
   analyses to be presented parts II and III of this series. (C) 2016

Title = {{The infrapatellar fat pad is affected by injury induced inflammation in
   the rabbit knee: use of dexamethasone to mitigate damage}},
Journal = {{INFLAMMATION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{65}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The health of the infrapatellar fat pad (IFP) has been linked to pain,
   joint inflammation, and the onset of post-traumatic osteoarthritis.
   Thus, early inflammation effects on the IFP could have long term
   sequelae on joint integrity. This study was designed to characterize the
   natural history of the IFP in a model of surgically induced knee injury
   and inflammation, and to test the efficacy of one intra-articular (IA)
   administration of dexamethasone (DEX) immediately following surgery.
   An IA bone drill hole injury to the rabbit knee was conducted and
   immediately treated with DEX (n = 12). Early and late post-surgical
   time-points were investigated (48 h and 9 weeks) and the outcome
   measures were analysis of IFP histology, mRNA levels for relevant
   molecules, and protein levels for a subset of cytokines. Data were
   analyzed against a surgical control (injury without treatment; n = 12),
   a surgical sham (capsular incision only; n = 12), and normal control (n
   = 6).
   Single IA injection of DEX (0.5 mg/kg), administered at the completion
   of surgery.
   IFPs from injured joints exhibited significantly increased cellularity
   and early fibrosis at 48 h post surgery. While the histological
   inflammation from a capsular incision alone resolved, knee injured
   animals progressed to a significantly more fibrotic IFP by 9 weeks. DEX
   significantly lowered histological scores at 48 h, but not at the 9
   weeks. DEX did not influence mRNA levels for IL-1 beta, 6, and 8,
   however, protein analysis indicated that IL-8 levels were lower in DEX
   treated joints. DEX resulted in significantly elevated expression of
   mRNA for MCP-1, leptin, and VEGF.
   One IA administration of a glucocorticoid appears to mitigate the
   initial inflammation within the joint, but is not sufficient to protect
   the joint to 9 weeks post-surgery.}},

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{The Elbow River watershed, located in the rain shadow of the Rocky
   Mountains in western Canada, is characterized by a complex hydrological
   regime due to significant differences in climate and geomorphological
   settings between the west and east sub-catchments. This watershed has
   experienced several extreme droughts and floods in the recent decades,
   which might be accentuated with climate change. This study was
   undertaken to investigate the average annual and seasonal variations of
   surface and sub-surface hydrological processes in the west and east
   sub-catchments along with and the entire watershed under five plausible
   GCM-scenarios up to 2070 using the physically-based, distributed MIKE
   SHE/MIKE 11 model. Most of the scenarios indicate a reduction in the
   average annual overland flow, groundwater recharge and baseflow in the
   east sub-catchment. The pattern of seasonal change generally exhibits a
   rise in overland flow, baseflow, evapotranspiration, groundwater
   recharge, and streamflow in winter-spring and a decline in summer-fall.
   The induced changes in hydrological processes are proportionally more
   perceptible in the east sub-catchment compared to the west
   sub-catchment. However, the west sub-catchment governs the watershed
   behaviour and determines the future changes, over-riding the stronger
   climate change signal in the east. This investigation indicates that a
   greater understanding of climate change impacts on the water balance of
   a watershed with significant differences in sub-regional settings is
   achieved when capturing the surface and subsurface hydrological process
   responses of each sub-catchment individually along with the entire
   watershed. Such information can guide water resources management by
   providing a more rigorous assessment of the processes involved in the
   watershed.}},

Title = {{Heavy oil polymer flooding from laboratory core floods to pilot tests

Abstract = {{Reservoir development is increasingly moving towards the heavy oil
   resources due to the rapid decline in conventional oil reserves. With
   the production of conventional low gravity crude oil being surpassed by
   heavy oil production in Alberta, the vast fields of heavy oil have been
   considered an emerging source of energy to the growing demands for oil
   and gas. Although the applications of thermal methods have been
   successful in many enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects, they are
   usually uneconomic or impractical in deep and thin pay zones reservoirs.
   Therefore, polymer flooding is a preferred EOR technique in such
   reservoirs.
   An application of polymer flooding in heavy oil reservoirs dates back to
   more than half a century ago. However, it has long been considered a
   suitable method for reservoirs with viscosities up to 100 cP only.
   Recently, this EOR technique has attracted great attentions and become a
   promising method for oil recovery from heavy oil reservoirs with
   viscosities ranging from several hundreds to several thousands of
   centipoises. The main reasons for such a widespread application of the
   technique in heavy oil reservoirs during the last two decades have been
   rises in oil prices, extensive use of horizontal wells and advances in
   the polymer manufacturing technology. This paper aims to review the
   advances and technological trends of polymer flooding in heavy oil
   reservoirs since the 1960s. Upon the review, complete data sets of the
   laboratory works, pilot tests and field applications are established.
   The database provides qualitative description and quantitative
   statistics regarding both scientific research and practical
   applications. Then suitable ranges of some crucial affecting reservoir
   properties and polymer characteristics for successful field applications
   are examined. Finally, new screening criteria are developed specifically
   for heavy oil reservoirs based on an analysis of the data. The criteria
   are compared with the previously established ones. The outcome of this
   paper can be used as guidelines for screening, planning, design and
   eventually implementation of future projects. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{A model of dynamic adsorption-diffusion for modeling gas transport and
   storage in shale}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{173}},
Pages = {{115-128}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Understanding gas transport and storage processes is essential for
   analysis of reservoir accumulation mechanisms and evaluation of a shale
   formation. Because organic matter such as kerogen is widely distributed
   in shale, it plays an important role in gas diffusion and adsorption.
   Although many mathematical models considering gas diffusion and
   adsorption have been proposed and evaluated, very few models consider
   the effect of organic matter on the dynamic adsorption process, and
   research studies systematically combining a mathematical model
   history-matched to experimental data is also rare. In this study, a
   dynamic, approaching equilibrium (hereinafter referred to as
   ``delayed{''}) adsorption-diffusion (DAD) method is presented to analyze
   gas transport and storage processes in crushed particles of three
   different sizes. The delayed effect for adsorption results from the
   dynamic mechanisms of gas dissolution and adsorption in the semi-liquid
   layer of organic matter. The mathematical model for this phenomenon is
   based on dynamic adsorption experiments with a constant pressure
   condition. The general and approximate solutions for the DAD model are
   obtained to estimate the physical parameters through a multilevel
   single-linkage method. From the fitting results of the DAD method, it is
   found that the absolute permeability begins to decrease when particles
   are crushed into smaller sizes and observed that particle size plays
   more important role than permeability in the diffusion process for
   crushed shale samples. Isotherm measurements for total gas and free gas
   reveal that the difference in gas content between total gas and adsorbed
   gas become greater as pressure increases. Sensitivity analyses for the
   model disclose that the apparent diffusion coefficient and
   adsorption/desorption rate coefficient determine gas transport and
   storage processes together. Analysis and comparison of a diffusion
   model, an instantaneous adsorption-diffusion (IAD) model, and the DAD
   model reveal that the former two models are special forms of the DAD
   model, and the sequence of equilibrium times required for the gas
   transport and storage processes is: DAD > IAD > diffusion model. (C)

Abstract = {{Cocontinuous polymer blends have wide applications. They can form
   conductive plastics with improved mechanical properties. When one phase
   is extracted, they yield porous polymer sheets, which can be used as
   filters or membrane supports. However, the cocontinuous morphology is
   intrinsically unstable due to coarsening during static annealing. In
   this study, silica nanoparticles, similar to 100 um diameter, with
   different wetting properties were melt compounded in
   polyethylene/poly(ethylene oxide) blends. Calculated wetting
   coefficients of these particles match well with their phase contact
   angles and their locations in the blends. We demonstrated that a
   monolayer of particles jamming at interfaces can effectively suppress
   coarsening and stabilize the cocontinuous morphology. We also correlated
   the wettability of individual particles at interface to their coarsening
   suppression ability and found that the most hydrophobic silica
   nanoparticle is the most effective to arrest coarsening. Moreover,
   during annealing, we used the rheological dynamic time sweep, a facial
   but sensitive method, to relate the morphology change with particle
   dispersion on the interface. We further corroborated these measurements
   by scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy imaging.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents an adaptive predistortion algorithm based on direct
   learning approach to compensate for the non-linearities of a power
   amplifier (PA) exhibiting memory effects. The proposed algorithm
   implements the steepest descent technique on an odd-order memory
   polynomial model to optimise the predistorter coefficients. The
   performance of the proposed algorithm is validated using a harmonically
   tuned broadband PA driven by long-term evolution 20 MHz signal.
   Measurement results confirmed the robustness of the proposed technique
   by adapting the coefficients of the predistorter to the changes in
   average input power, drain bias, and gate bias of the PA. The
   linearisation using the proposed algorithm is compared to the
   traditional uncompensated case and results are presented. For changes in
   average input power, gate bias and drain bias levels, the normalised
   mean square error shows substantial enhancement when the predistortion
   coefficients are updated using the proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{An optical contact pH sensor integrated with capillary microfluidics is
   proposed in this paper. The complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor
   sensing array detects the changes of light intensity after absorption by
   a phenol red-doped sol-gel filter, while the level of absorbance
   corresponds to a pH value of the analyte. The optical signal is analyzed
   by image processing to compare the change in intensity of the filter
   following sample introduction, thereby obtaining the actual pH value.
   Deposition methods of sol-gel are optimized and compared. A spin-coating
   screen-printing process is proposed and tested for creating thin and
   crack-free sol-gel patterns. Two similar phenol red-doped sol-gel
   filters are patterned on the same sensor array to collect more precise
   results. This system offers the capability to perform an optical-based
   multi-parametric detection. Capillary microfluidics is utilized to
   enable a real-time flow in and out of the sample, as well as, for
   establishing more precise control over the sample introduction.}},

Title = {{Measurement of dynamic adsorption-diffusion process of methane in shale}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{172}},
Pages = {{37-48}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Shale gas is becoming an increasingly important energy resource in
   recent years. Identifying the gas transport process in a shale matrix is
   therefore of great importance in designing development strategies and in
   formulating the appropriate predictive mathematical models. Experimental
   and numerical investigations were conducted to study gas transport in
   shale. This paper presents the experimental work and obtains two
   characteristic parameters from the test results which will be utilized
   to serve the numerical work. Of great relevance to field development and
   management is knowing the contribution of each gas source to gas
   transport history and to ultimate gas recovery. Shale samples from
   Sichuan Basin in China were studied at designed conditions to test the
   effect of boundary pressure, temperature, particle size, and total
   organic content (TOC) on the dynamic adsorption-diffusion process. The
   tests for crushed shale samples were conducted at 35 degrees C, 40
   degrees C, and 45 degrees C, and at test pressures up to 17 MPag. By
   plotting a curve describing the gas volume change per unit mass at
   standard condition over time (Vad), the adsorption-diffusion process at
   isothermal and constant boundary pressure (ICBP) was investigated and
   interpreted. These results indicate that both higher pressures and
   higher temperatures could promote a faster adsorption-diffusion rate,
   thus could promote a greater adsorption constant rate. Higher
   temperatures caused less gas to be adsorbed into the shale particles.
   Under the same experimental conditions, a difference in particle size
   showed no influence on the amount of gas adsorbed, but had a significant
   effect on the dynamic adsorption-diffusion process: the processing time
   extended linearly with the diameter of the particle size. (C) 2016

Journal = {{NEUROCOMPUTING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{189}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{MAY 12}},
Abstract = {{The standard one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM) is sensitive to
   noises, since every instance is equally treated. To address this
   problem, the weighted one-class support vector machine (WOC-SVM) was
   presented. WOC-SVM weakens the impact of noises by assigning lower
   weights. In this paper, a novel instance-weighted strategy is proposed
   for WOC-SVM. The weight is only relevant to the neighbors' distribution
   knowledge, which is only decided by k-nearest neighbors. The closer to
   the boundary of the data distribution the instance is, the lower the
   corresponding weight is. The experimental results demonstrate that
   WOC-SVM outperforms the standard OC-SVM when using the proposed instance
   weighted strategy. The proposed instance-weighted method performs better
   than previous ones. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Typical thermal processes involve sophisticated wellbore configurations,
   complex fluid flow, and heat transfer in tubing, annulus, wellbore
   completion, and surrounding formation. Despite notable advancements made
   in wellbore modeling, accurate heat-loss modeling is still a challenge
   by use of the existing wellbore simulators. This challenge becomes even
   greater when complex but common wellbore configurations, such as
   multiparallel or multi-concentric tubings, are used in thermal processes
   such as steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD).
   To improve heat-loss estimation, a standalone fully implicit thermal
   wellbore simulator is developed that can handle several different
   wellbore configurations and completions. This simulator uses a fully
   implicit method to model heat loss from tubing walls to the surrounding
   formation. Instead of implementing the common Ramey (1962) method for
   heat-loss calculations, which has been shown to be a source of large
   errors, a series of computational-fluid-dynamics (CFD) models are run
   for the buoyancy-driven flow for different annulus sizes and lengths and
   numbers of tubings. On the basis of these CFD models, correlations are
   derived that can conveniently be used for the more-accurate heat-loss
   estimation from the wellbore to the surrounding formation for SAGD
   injection wells with single or multiple tubing strings. These
   correlations are embedded in the developed wellbore simulator, and
   results are compared with other heat-loss modeling methods to
   demonstrate its improvements. A series of validations against commercial
   simulators and field data are presented in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Nuclear magnetic resonance has been applied in well logging to
   investigate pore size distribution with high resolution and accuracy
   based on the relaxation time distribution. However, due to the
   heterogeneity of natural rock, pore surface relaxivity, which links
   relaxation time and pore size, varies within the pore system. To analyze
   and alter pore surface relaxivity, we saturated Boise sandstone cores
   with positively charged zirconia nanoparticle dispersions in which
   nanoparticles can be adsorbed onto the sandstone pore wall, while
   negatively charged zirconia nanoparticles dispersions were used as a
   control group to provide the baseline of nanoparticle retention due to
   nonelectrostatic attraction. We have performed core flushing with
   deionized water, pure acid, and alkali with different pH values;
   compared properties of zirconia nanoparticles before and after exposure
   to Boise sandstone; analyzed the portion of zirconia nanoparticles
   retained in the rock; altered pore surface relaxivity; and linked the
   adsorbed nanoparticle concentration on the pore surface to the modified
   surface relaxivity. Our work has indicated that after two pore volumes
   of core flooding, there was approximately 1\% of negatively charged
   nanoparticles trapped in the Boise sandstone core, whereas approximately
   8\%-11\% of positively charged nanoparticles was retained in the Boise
   sandstone cores. Our results indicated that besides van der Waals
   attraction, electrostatic attraction was the driving force for retention
   of nanoparticles with a positive surface charge in sandstone cores. The
   attachment of nanoparticles onto sandstone surfaces changed the mineral
   surface relaxivity. Exposure to acidic or strong alkaline conditions
   increased the Boise sandstone surface relaxivity. After contact with
   Boise sandstone, the nanoparticles themselves exhibited increased
   relaxivity due to interactions between nanoparticles dispersion and
   mineral surface under different pH conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a c(m) model is proposed to quantify structural states of
   soft mudrocks, which are dependent on clay fractions and porosities.
   Physical properties of natural and reconstituted soft mudrock samples
   are used to derive two parameters in the c(m) model. With the c(m)
   model, a simplified homogenization approach is proposed to estimate
   geomechanical properties and fabric orientation distributions of soft
   mudrocks based on the mixture theory. Soft mudrocks are treated as a
   mixture of nonclay minerals and clay-water composites. Nonclay minerals
   have a high stiffness and serve as a structural framework of mudrocks
   when they have a high volume fraction. Clay-water composites occupy the
   void space among nonclay minerals and serve as an in-fill matrix. With
   the increase of volume fraction of clay-water composites, there is a
   transition in the structural state from the state of framework supported
   to the state of matrix supported. The decreases in shear strength and
   pore size as well as increases in compressibility and anisotropy in
   fabric are quantitatively related to such transition. The new
   homogenization approach based on the proposed c(m) model yields better
   performance evaluation than common effective medium modeling approaches
   because the interactions among nonclay minerals and clay-water
   composites are considered. With wireline logging data, the c(m) model is
   applied to quantify the structural states of Colorado shale formations
   at different depths in the Cold Lake area, Alberta, Canada. Key
   geomechancial parameters are estimated based on the proposed
   homogenization approach and the critical intervals with low strength
   shale formations are identified.}},

Title = {{Characterization of multi-fractured horizontal shale wells using drill
   cuttings: 1. Fluid-in-place estimation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{32}},
Pages = {{574-585}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The most common method to produce shale gas and liquid-rich (gas
   condensate and oil) shale reservoirs is through long horizontal wells
   completed in multiple hydraulic fracturing stages. Usually the only
   reservoir samples gathered from these wells are drill cuttings obtained
   at multiple intervals along the well. While drill cuttings collection is
   inexpensive, and can allow for high density sampling in heterogeneous
   reservoirs, quantitative analysis of cuttings for reservoir properties
   remains a challenge.
   An important property to assess from drill cuttings is fluid storage
   capacity. In shales, fluid storage may occur via multiple mechanisms
   within the complex pore structure, including adsorption in microporosity
   (pore width < 2 nm), multi-mechanism storage (free gas and adsorption)
   in mesopores (pore width between 2 and 50 nm), and free gas storage in
   macroporosity (pore width greater than 50 nm). Rigorous models that
   account for these complex storage mechanisms over the wide range of pore
   sizes typically observed in shales are therefore required. A further
   complication, particularly important for liquid-rich shales, is the
   alteration of fluid properties, which can affect both fluid storage and
   producibility, due to pore confinement. Rigorous models are also
   required to account for these effects so that resource in place and
   recovery can be properly predicted.
   In this work, the use of high-precision, low-pressure adsorption data,
   combined with the simplified local density model (SLD) is explored for
   the purpose of 1) estimating high-pressure hydrocarbon storage and 2)
   calculating fluid property alteration using artificial drill cuttings.
   Use of low-pressure adsorption equipment, commonly used for estimating
   internal surface area and pore size distributions, is necessary to allow
   quantitative analysis of small sample sizes typical of cuttings.
   Artificial cuttings, created by crushing larger core samples, are used
   to enable comparison with more conventional methods applicable to large
   sample sizes.
   It is demonstrated herein for the first time that the SLD model, after
   calibration to low-pressure, non hydrocarbon gas adsorption data (CO2
   and N-2), may be used to predict high-pressure hydrocarbon gas
   adsorption. Further, it is demonstrated that the SLD model may be used
   to predict phase behavior changes of liquid-rich gases in confined
   pores. The end result is that fluid storage properties from small masses
   of cuttings may be determined rapidly and accurately enabling the
   quantification of fluid-in place along the length of a horizontal well.

Title = {{Characterization of multi-fractured horizontal shale wells using drill
   cuttings: 2. Permeability/diffusivity estimation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{32}},
Pages = {{586-596}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{There is considerable research interest in the transport properties of
   shales to assist in their evaluation as reservoirs for natural gas and
   oil. However, shales have proven difficult to characterize, in part
   because of the challenges of obtaining viable reservoir samples from
   multi-fractured horizontal wells used to produce from them. Often the
   only reservoir samples available from horizontal wells are drill
   cuttings the sample sizes obtained from cuttings are typically too small
   for quantitative analysis using conventional techniques. Therefore, new,
   high-precision methods are required to analyze the smaller cuttings
   samples. Further, the physics of gas storage and transport through the
   multi-model pore structure of shale is complex, requiring rigorous
   modeling approaches to extract parameters of interest such as
   permeability/diffusivity.
   In this work, the use of a high-precision, low-pressure adsorption
   device is explored for extracting permeability/diffusivity parameters
   from small amounts (1-2 g) of artificial (crushed core sample) drill
   cuttings of Duvernay shale. In order to extract the transport
   parameters, gas flow through the complex, heterogeneous matrix pore
   structure of the shale has been approximated using a general dual
   porosity numerical model which assumes that (1) gas flows through
   macropores by continuum viscous flow (2) gas flows through meso and
   micropores by Knudsen diffusion and molecular slippage on pore walls and
   (3) adsorption occurs in meso and micropores. The model can be
   simplified into two sub-models, a macro/micropore system or
   meso/micropore system, depending on the measured pore size distribution
   of the samples of interest.
   The new multi-pore (bidisperse) numerical model is applied to carbon
   dioxide low-pressure adsorption rate data obtained from the crushed
   Duvernay shale core samples, and apparent permeability for each
   gas/sample group is calculated at different pressure steps. The
   low-pressure adsorption device yields pressure-time data that is of much
   better quality than a commercial crushed rock permeability device that
   requires larger sample sizes. The new bidisperse pore structure
   numerical model, which allows permeability to vary (at each pressure
   step) due to gas slippage effects, properly describes the entire
   adsorption rate history of the samples studied. Mesopore apparent
   permeabilities range from1 x 10(-2)-1 x 10(-3) mD and micropore apparent
   diffusivities are in the 1 x 10(-7) mD range. The calculated apparent
   diffusivities obtained from modeling adsorption rate data change with
   pressure.
   The results of this study have important implications for shale matrix
   transport characterization. The resulting data can be used for making
   completions decisions and in reservoir models which capture reservoir
   property changes along a horizontal lateral. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Nanoscale friction often exhibits hysteresis when load is increased
   (loading) and then decreased (unloading) and is manifested as larger
   friction measured during unloading compared to loading for a given load.
   In this work, the origins of load-dependent friction hysteresis were
   explored through atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments of a silicon
   tip sliding on chemical vapor deposited graphene in air, and molecular
   dynamics simulations of a model AFM tip on graphene, mimicking both
   vacuum and humid air environmental conditions. It was found that only
   simulations with water at the tip graphene contact reproduced the
   experimentally observed hysteresis. The mechanisms underlying this
   friction hysteresis were then investigated in the simulations by varying
   the graphene water interaction strength. The size of the water graphene
   interface exhibited hysteresis trends consistent with the friction,
   while measures of other previously proposed mechanisms, such as
   out-of-plane deformation of the graphene film and irreversible
   reorganization of the water molecules at the shearing interface, were
   less correlated to the friction hysteresis. The relationship between the
   size of the sliding interface and friction observed in the simulations
   was explained in terms of the varying contact angles in front of and
   behind the sliding tip, which were larger during loading than unloading.}},

Abstract = {{The expanded fluid (EF) viscosity model was recently developed for
   petroleum applications. While petroleum fluids can be modeled as a
   single-component fluid, process calculations often require that the
   fluid be treated as a mixture of pseudo-components. For mixtures, the EF
   model mixing rules require binary interaction parameters, alpha(ij),
   between each component pair in the mixture, which are fitted to
   experimental data. In this study, a generalized correlation is developed
   for these interaction parameters as a function of the specific gravity
   and hydrogen/carbon ratio of the mixture components. The proposed
   correlation was developed on the basis of a data set that included
   viscosity and density literature data for pure hydrocarbon pairs at room
   temperature and atmospheric pressure and new data for pseudo-pairs of
   heavy oil/solvent at temperatures from 21 to 175 degrees C, pressures up
   to 10 MPa, and solvent contents up to 40 wt \%. The correlation was
   assessed on a distinct test data set that included viscosity data for
   pure hydrocarbon mixtures from the literature, new data for deasphalted
   crude oils diluted with paraffinic and aromatic solvents, and new data
   for crude oils diluted with similar solvents. The viscosities of the
   development and test data sets were predicted with an overall average
   absolute relative deviation (AARD) of 13 and 10\%, respectively,
   compared to 36 and 50\%, respectively, when ideal mixing, alpha(ij) = 0,
   was assumed. Finally, the correlation was tested on an independent data
   set from the literature, including viscosity data for crude oils diluted
   with a variety of solvents. The viscosities of the independent data set
   were predicted with an overall AARD of 14\%, as compared to 30\% when
   ideal mixing, alpha(ij) = 0, was assumed. The deviations obtained with
   the correlated ay are almost as low as those obtained when fitting the
   data by adjusting alpha(ij).}},

Abstract = {{Since 2002, the Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) production
   technique has had a skyrocketing growth in the province of Alberta,
   increasing production from 31,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2002 up to
   577,000 bpd by 2013. SAGD is a highly energy intensive method that
   consumes large quantities of natural gas and water for the production of
   steam. Once heavy oils are extracted via SAGD they must meet pipeline
   specifications in order to be commercialized, thus dilution with a
   higher value hydrocarbon or invest in a long-term upgrading project. One
   way of optimizing and integrating the extraction and upgrading of heavy
   oils is proposed with the development of the Dense Hot Fluid Injection
   (DHFI) process, a catalytic in situ upgrading technology. The process
   targets the substitution at least partially of steam by a high heat
   capacity fluid carrying to the reservoir heat, dispersed nanocatalyst,
   and hydrogen in order to generate a more competitive oil sand product.
   It targets the conversion of the vacuum residue (VR) fraction and
   generates an upgraded synthetic crude oil (SCO) with no vacuum residue
   and with pipeline transportable-viscosity. In this work a
   two-dimensional bench scale plant is used for the experimental
   simulation of production and upgrading of an Athabasca type reservoir
   via DHFI processing. The arrangement is designed to study the heat
   distribution and oil production from a system with different
   permeabilities. VR is injected at different residence times to study its
   conversion levels, and a postmortem product mapping is performed to the
   residual oil left in the sand packed media. Results confirmed that
   important upgrading occurs at 500 psi, 350 degrees C, and hydrogen
   injection ratios of 300 sccm H2/cc VR Under the most severe studied
   case, products reached API gravities of 16 degrees API from a feedstock
   of 2.4 degrees API. Extremely light hydrocarbons were found within high
   permeable areas of the rig, while the thermal distribution of the
   process confirmed the differences between steam injection, presenting
   ``V{''} type chambers, and dense fluid injection with elliptical shape
   distributions.}},

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{A series of sand pack flood tests are carried out on Court heavy oil
   using different alkali solutions to evaluate the influence of different
   factors on enhanced oil recovery of heavy oil, such as interfacial
   tension (IFT), emulsification effect, and pressure drop. These alkali
   solutions include NaOH, Na2CO3, NaOH-surfactant, Na2CO3-surfactant, and
   the mixtures of NaOH and Na2CO3 at different ratios. The results
   demonstrated that using NaOH solution to displace heavy oil obtained the
   best oil recovery efficiency but without the lowest IFT and the most
   effective emulsification. By correlation of the enhanced oil recovery
   efficiencies with IFTs, emulsification effects, and pressure drops, it
   was found that the oil recovery efficiency corresponded better with the
   increments in pressure drop than other factors after chemical slug
   injection. In combination with the discovery of micromodel tests, it was
   deduced that the improvement on the heavy oil recovery efficiency was
   mainly due to the formation of an oil bank, which plugged the water
   channel. The formation of the oil bank for the NaOH displacing process
   is due to the accumulation of oil droplets. While for the
   NaOH-surfactant flooding process, the formation of the oil bank is
   mainly because of the emulsification. OH- exerts a special influence on
   the separation of trapped oil into oil droplets and the accumulation of
   oil droplets. A certain amount of OH- is required to reduce the IFT,
   which is beneficial to the formation of oil droplets, while excessive
   OH- can promote the accumulation of oil droplets, which is also
   detrimental to the formation of oil droplets.}},

Abstract = {{Water level monitoring provides essential information about the
   condition of aquifers and their responses to water extraction, land-use
   change, and climatic variability. It is important to have a spatially
   distributed, long-term monitoring well network for sustainable
   groundwater resource management. Community-based monitoring involving
   citizen scientists provides an approach to complement existing
   government-run monitoring programs. This article demonstrates the
   feasibility of establishing a large-scale water level monitoring network
   of private water supply wells using an example from Rocky View County
   (3900 km(2)) in Alberta, Canada. In this network, community volunteers
   measure the water level in their wells, and enter these data through a
   web-based data portal, which allows the public to view and download
   these data. The close collaboration among the university researchers,
   county staff members, and community volunteers enabled the successful
   implementation and operation of the network for a 5-year pilot period,
   which generated valuable data sets. The monitoring program was
   accompanied by education and outreach programs, in which the educational
   materials on groundwater were developed in collaboration with science
   teachers from local schools. The methodology used in this study can be
   easily adopted by other municipalities and watershed stewardship groups
   interested in groundwater monitoring. As governments are starting to
   rely increasingly on local municipalities and conservation authorities
   for watershed management and planning, community-based groundwater
   monitoring provides an effective and affordable tool for sustainable
   water resources management.}},

   significantly improves the performance of the crossover memory

   Hammerstein (2 x 2 PH) model, while requiring the same number of

   PH. The model was tested for forward modeling and digital predistortion
   (DPD) applications in the presence of both linear and nonlinear
   crosstalk. Experimental results show that the model outperforms the

Abstract = {{Achieving high spectrum efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) is of
   primary importance for the sustainability of future cellular networks,
   but a key challenge is on balancing the tradeoff that arises when
   maximizing both of these performance metrics simultaneously. This paper
   develops a framework for analyzing the SE and EE of a two-tier
   heterogeneous cellular network consisting of macrocell and femtocell
   base stations (BSs) operating under a shared-spectrum scenario. It is
   shown that both the SE and the EE can be significantly enhanced with the
   overlaid deployment of the femto tier. However, the performance gain
   achievable is found to be strongly dependent on the load level and the
   BS power consumption attributes. A multiobjective optimization problem
   that maximizes the SE and the EE subject to quality-of-service (QoS)
   constraints is formulated and solved to give the Pareto-optimal
   operational regime. The novelty of this work is the quantification of
   the SE-EE tradeoff as a Lebesgue measure, which is defined by the
   Pareto-optimal regime. The developed framework is useful for studying
   the impact of the load on the SE-EE tradeoff, based on a strategy that
   exploits the varying load conditions to achieve good balance in the
   SE-EE tradeoff is formulated. Numerical results show that, while the
   improvement achieved in minimizing the SE-EE performance gap is marginal
   under high-load conditions, it is feasible to significantly increase the
   SE and the EE during low-load conditions and satisfy the users' QoS
   requirements by optimally adapting the density of the femto-tier BSs
   accessing the shared spectrum.}},

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the impact of wind speed correlation uncertainties
   among multiple wind farms on optimal integration of these wind energy
   conversion systems to bulk electric system. The problem is solved by a
   fuzzy version of technique for order preference by similarity to ideal
   solution as a proficient multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method.
   The uncertainties are addressed through utilizing triangular fuzzy
   numbers. The proposed MCDM approach considers emission, interruption,
   and operation and investment costs as three competent decision-making
   criteria. A sequential Monte Carlo simulation-based chronological
   optimal power flow (MCS-COPF) incorporating time series characteristics
   of wind farms is also proposed in this paper to calculate the

Abstract = {{Undoped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and N-CNTs are synthesized by chemical
   vapor deposition using Fe catalyst, and then melt-mixed in an APAM mixer
   with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) to prepare the nanocomposites. The
   morphology, crystallinity, aspect ratio, nitrogen content, and nitrogen
   bonding type of CNTs, and the broadband dielectric properties of undoped
   CNT/PVDF and N-CNT/PVDF nanocomposites are analyzed. The results show
   that while undoped CNTs present a crystalline structure with open
   channels, doping with nitrogen results in CNTs with a bamboo-like
   configuration, inferior crystallinity, smaller length, and larger
   diameter. The N-CNT/PVDF nanocomposites, thus, have a higher percolation
   threshold (approximate to 3.5 wt\%) compared to that of the undoped
   CNT/PVDF nanocomposites (approximate to 0.5 wt\%). Comparison of the
   broadband dielectric properties of the generated nanocomposites reveals
   that nitrogen doping improved the dielectric properties in the
   insulative region. This is ascribed to the role of nitrogen atoms and
   their sequent defects in the nanotubes, which act as scattering centers
   and provide additional polarization sites. For instance, 1.0 wt\%
   N-CNT/PVDF nanocomposites exhibit a real permittivity of epsilon' = 22
   and a dissipation factor of tan delta = 0.03 at 1 kHz, a combination
   superior to that of 0.5 wt\% undoped CNT/PVDF nanocomposite with
   epsilon' = 11.2 and tan delta = 3.8, and 1.0 wt\% undoped CNT/PVDF
   nanocomposites with e' = 40 and tan delta = 1.4 x 10(5).}},

Abstract = {{Five-axis CNC machine tools are widely used in manufacturing of parts
   with free-form surfaces. Geometric errors of machine tools have
   significant effects on the quality of manufactured parts. This research
   focuses on development of a new method to accurately identify geometric
   errors of 5-axis CNC machines, especially the errors due to rotary axes,
   using the magnetic double ball bar. A theoretical model for
   identification of geometric errors is provided. In this model, both
   position-independent errors and position-dependent errors are considered
   as the error sources. This model is simplified by identification and
   removal of the correlated and insignificant error sources of the
   machine. Insignificant error sources are identified using the
   sensitivity analysis technique. Simulation results reveal that the
   simplified error identification model can result in more accurate
   estimations of the error parameters. Experiments on a 5-axis CNC machine

Abstract = {{In this paper, synchronization of chaotic systems with unknown

   adaptive observer and an adaptive controller have been designed.
   Moreover, a neural network is utilized to approximate the unknown
   dynamics of the slave system. The proposed method imposes neither
   restrictive assumption nor constraint on the dynamics of the systems.
   Furthermore, the stability of the entire closed-loop system in the
   presence of the observer dynamics has been established. Finally,
   effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated via computer

Abstract = {{Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were introduced into poly(methyl
   methacrylate) (PMMA) and styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer (SAN) blends by
   melt mixing in an asymmetric miniature mixer (APAM). A composition of 70
   wt\% of PMMA and 30 wt\% of SAN was mixed to create a co-continuous
   morphology. Transmission electron microscopy images of ultra-microtomed
   samples (70 nm in thickness) showed selective localization of MWCNTs
   inside the percolated SAN phase. The occurrence of the double
   percolation phenomenon resulted in lower electrical percolation
   thresholds of PMMA/SAN/MWCNT blends molded at high temperatures.
   Dielectric spectroscopy indicated a higher electrical permittivity for
   samples that were compression molded at 260 degrees C. Due to the higher
   affinity of MWCNTs to SAN, there was a migration of MWCNTs into the SAN
   phase during the melt processing. Conductivity measurements revealed a
   significant decrease in electrical percolation threshold (0.4 wt\%) for

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MECHANICS B-FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{129-142}},
Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{We report a comprehensive and systematic study on of liquid bridge
   dynamics inside microchannels subject to external pulsatile flows. A
   pulsatile body force is applied on both liquid bridge and surrounding
   fluid to represent a pressure-driven flow. The Cahn-Hilliard
   diffuse-interface model is used to determine the interfacial evolution
   and the three phase contact line motion on the solid substrates. Effects
   of the walls' wettability (theta), pulsatile flow frequency (omega),
   ratio of oscillation amplitude to the net body force (e), viscosity
   ratio (R-v), liquid bridge geometrical aspect ratio (W-h), and density
   ratio (R-d) are analyzed. Results indicate that inertial forces effects
   on the liquid bridge dynamics are relatively more important under
   pulsatile flow conditions in comparison with steady state flows with the
   same net force. However these effects did not result in important
   qualitative changes. Examination of the effects of the flow frequency
   revealed that at low omega, the bridge goes through strong deformations
   that lead to breakup or detachment. A non-monotonic variation of the
   rupture time with the flow frequency was found. At higher frequencies
   large deformations are suppressed if the net flow is not strong. Changes
   in W-h strongly affect the interfacial deformation and solid-liquid
   viscous dissipation, and in particular, a non-monotonic trend for the
   variation of the detachment location with W-h is observed. Variations in
   the viscosity ratio R-v, change the surrounding fluid resistance against
   the interfacial deformation, rupturing, detachment, and movement.
   Depending on the wettability property of the solid walls, changes in R-v
   result in two opposite effects on the liquid bridge dynamics. Finally
   any change in e affects the oscillation part of the flow velocity which
   in turn influences the magnitude of deformation of the liquid bridge. A
   non-monotonic variation of the detachment time with e was found. The
   main reason for the reported non-monotonic behaviors is the out of phase
   behavior of the three phase contact lines and the external flow field.

Title = {{Potential application of wavelet neural network ensemble to forecast
   streamflow for flood management}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{536}},
Pages = {{161-173}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Streamflow forecasting, especially the long lead-time forecasting, is
   still a very challenging task in hydrologic modeling. This could be due
   to the fact that the forecast accuracy measured in terms of both the
   amplitude and phase or temporal errors and the forecast
   precision/reliability quantified in terms of the uncertainty
   significantly deteriorate with the increase of the lead-time. In the
   model performance evaluation, the conventional error metrics, which
   primarily quantify the amplitude error and do not explicitly account for
   the phase error, have been commonly adopted. For the long lead-time
   forecasting, the wavelet based neural network (WNN) among a variety of
   advanced soft computing methods has been shown to be promising in the
   literature. This paper presented and compared WNN and artificial neural
   network (ANN), both of which were combined with the ensemble method
   using block bootstrap sampling (BB), in terms of the forecast accuracy
   and precision at various lead-times on the Bow River, Alberta, Canada.
   Apart from conventional model performance metrics, a new index, called
   percent volumetric error, was proposed, especially for quantifying the
   phase error. The uncertainty metrics including percentage of coverage
   and average width were used to evaluate the precision of the modeling
   approaches. The results obtained demonstrate that the WNN-BB
   consistently outperforms the ANN-BB in both the categories of the
   forecast accuracy and precision, especially in the long lead-time
   forecasting. The findings strongly suggest that the WNN-BB is a robust
   modeling approach for streamflow forecasting and thus would aid in flood
   management. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Indoor wireless localization using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons
   has attracted considerable attention after the release of the BLE
   protocol. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that uses the
   combination of channel-separate polynomial regression model (PRM),
   channel-separate fingerprinting (FP), outlier detection and extended
   Kalman filtering (EKF) for smartphone-based indoor localization with BLE
   beacons. The proposed algorithm uses FP and PRM to estimate the target's
   location and the distances between the target and BLE beacons
   respectively. We compare the performance of distance estimation that
   uses separate PRM for three advertisement channels (i.e., the separate
   strategy) with that use an aggregate PRM generated through the
   combination of information from all channels (i.e., the aggregate
   strategy). The performance of FP-based location estimation results of
   the separate strategy and the aggregate strategy are also compared. It
   was found that the separate strategy can provide higher accuracy; thus,
   it is preferred to adopt PRM and FP for each BLE advertisement channel
   separately. Furthermore, to enhance the robustness of the algorithm, a
   two-level outlier detection mechanism is designed. Distance and location
   estimates obtained from PRM and FP are passed to the first outlier
   detection to generate improved distance estimates for the EKF. After the
   EKF process, the second outlier detection algorithm based on statistical
   testing is further performed to remove the outliers. The proposed
   algorithm was evaluated by various field experiments. Results show that
   the proposed algorithm achieved the accuracy of <2.56 m at 90\% of the
   time with dense deployment of BLE beacons (1 beacon per 9 m), which
   performs 35.82\% better than <3.99 m from the Propagation Model (PM) +
   EKF algorithm and 15.77\% more accurate than <3.04 m from the FP + EKF
   algorithm. With sparse deployment (1 beacon per 18 m), the proposed
   algorithm achieves the accuracies of <3.88 m at 90\% of the time, which
   performs 49.58\% more accurate than <8.00 m from the PM + EKF algorithm
   and 21.41\% better than <4.94 m from the FP + EKF algorithm. Therefore,
   the proposed algorithm is especially useful to improve the localization
   accuracy in environments with sparse beacon deployment.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the location-dependent performance metrics of
   coverage probability and spectral efficiency in hexagonal cellular
   networks under Rayleigh fading with a general distribution for shadowing
   and also including two special cases of no shadowing and lognormal
   shadowing. The effects of system parameters such as frequency reuse
   factor, transmission probability of base stations, and
   signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio gap from Shannon capacity are
   accurately characterized. The proposed approach is applied to fractional
   frequency reuse (FFR) scheme where the impact of FFR on spectral
   efficiency is evaluated. Numerical results show that (i) in a
   lognormal-shadowed Rayleigh fading channel with the shadowing standard
   deviation of 12dB, the cell area wide spectral efficiency is degraded by
   approximately 40\% compared with when there is Rayleigh fading without
   shadowing; (ii) the improvement in spectral efficiency achieved by FFR
   over the universal frequency reuse increases as the transmission
   probability increases and the shadowing becomes less severe; and (iii)
   in Rayleigh fading without shadowing environment where all the base
   stations are actively transmitting, FFR achieves approximately 20\%
   improvement in spectral efficiency in the cell edge area. Interestingly,
   this improvement increases to about 30\% if a 3-dB
   signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio gap from Shannon capacity is
   further accounted. Copyright (c) 2015 JohnWiley \& Sons}},

Title = {{Economic assessment of integrated coal gasification combined cycle with

Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},

Volume = {{169}},

Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{An integrated gasification combined cycle process with sorbent CO2
   capture (IGCC-SCC) using lime (CaO) was developed to assess the
   application of the gasification process to the power generation
   industry. Aspen Plus was used to simulate the detailed heat and material
   balance of the process. The process modeling results, including the
   composition, flow rate, temperature, pressure and enthalpy of different
   streams, were used to determine the sizes of the process units and
   related equipment.
   A high-level economic model was prepared to evaluate the economic
   viability of an IGCC-SCC plant and to compare it to GE Energy and Shell
   Convective gasification plants for converting coal to power. The results
   show that the proposed process would produce 560 MW of power with a net
   plant efficiency of 46.4\% compared to those of the GE Energy and Shell
   Convective plants, which are 39.2\% and 42.0\%, respectively. The total
   capital investment required for an IGCC-SCC facility having a coal
   capacity of 3000 tpd was estimated to be \$1082 million, which
   translates to a specific annual capital expenditure (CAPEX) of 1889
   \$/kW. It was estimated that an IGCC-SCC plant could generate an
   after-tax internal rate of return (IRR) of 14.4\%, which is equivalent
   to a payback period of 9.1 years. This represents an improvement over
   the IRR and payback period of the GE Energy and Shell Convective plants
   at the same capacity.
   A sensitivity analysis was also conducted in order to identify the
   relative importance of key economic variables driving the project
   returns and to quantify the impact of any changes to the assumptions
   used in the project economics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Improved PPP ambiguity resolution by COES FCB estimation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEODESY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{437-450}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Precise point positioning (PPP) integer ambiguity resolution is able to
   significantly improve the positioning accuracy with the correction of
   fractional cycle biases (FCBs) by shortening the time to first fix
   (TTFF) of ambiguities. When satellite orbit products are adopted to
   estimate the satellite FCB corrections, the narrow-lane (NL) FCB
   corrections will be contaminated by the orbit's line-of-sight (LOS)
   errors which subsequently affect ambiguity resolution (AR) performance,
   as well as positioning accuracy. To effectively separate orbit errors
   from satellite FCBs, we propose a cascaded orbit error separation (COES)
   method for the PPP implementation. Instead of using only one
   direction-independent component in previous studies, the satellite NL
   improved FCB corrections are modeled by one direction-independent
   component and three directional-dependent components per satellite in
   this study. More specifically, the direction-independent component
   assimilates actual FCBs, whereas the directional-dependent components
   are used to assimilate the orbit errors. To evaluate the performance of
   the proposed method, GPS measurements from a regional and a global
   network are processed with the IGSReal-time service (RTS), IGS rapid
   (IGR) products and predicted orbits with 10 cm 3D root mean square (RMS)
   error. The improvements by the proposed FCB estimation method are
   validated in terms of ambiguity fractions after applying FCB corrections
   and positioning accuracy. The numerical results confirm that the
   obtained FCBs using the proposed method outperform those by conventional
   method. The RMS of ambiguity fractions after applying FCB corrections is
   reduced by 13.2 \%. The position RMSs in north, east and up directions
   are reduced by 30.0, 32.0 and 22.0 \% on average.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this research is to evaluate the performance of three
   turbulence models with respect to flow with high curvature in a
   centrifugal compressor stage designed for an aero-engine. The
   effectiveness of the curvature correction terms in the two-equation
   turbulence models is the main focus of this study, as implemented in the
   curvature-corrected shear stress transport (SST-CC) model of Smirnov and
   Menter. The SST-CC model uses a production multiplier in the k and omega
   equations. SST-CC results were compared against the SST model and
   previous simulations by Bourgeois et al. (2011, ``Assessment of
   Turbulence Model Predictions for an Aero-Engine Centrifugal
   Compressor,{''} ASME J. Turbomach., 133(1), pp. 1-15) using the Reynolds
   stress model (RSM-SSG) for stage performance characteristics,
   experimental velocity profiles at the impeller-diffuser interface, and
   velocity contours at the diffuser exit. The production multiplier was
   investigated in the compressor impeller. The comparisons showed that the
   SST-CC model better predicted the choke region in the pressure
   characteristic and efficiency characteristic, whereas the SST model
   better predicted the stall region. However, both models predicted a
   similar mean flow velocity field. Analysis of the production multiplier
   demonstrated that the term provided the expected effects near the walls
   of the convex and concave surfaces. However, away from the walls where
   turbulent production term was insignificant, the production multiplier
   showed abnormal predictions. The rotation effects were found to be
   weaker than the curvature effects near the impeller trailing edge of the
   current compressor.}},

Abstract = {{We describe an enzymatically formed chondroitin sulfate (CS) and
   poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) based hybrid hydrogel system, which by
   tuning the architecture and composition of modular building blocks,
   allows the application-specific tailoring of growth factor delivery and
   cellular responses. CS, a negatively charged sulfate-rich
   glycosaminoglycan of the extracellular matrix (ECM), known for its
   growth factor binding and stem cell regulatory functions, is used as a
   starting material for the engineering of this biomimetic materials
   platform. The functionalization of CS with transglutaminase factor XIII
   specific substrate sequences is utilized to allow cross-linking of CS
   with previously described fibrin-mimetic TG-PEG hydrogel precursors. We
   show that the hydrogel network properties can be tuned by varying the
   degree of functionalization of CS as well as the ratio and
   concentrations of PEG and CS precursors. Taking advantage of TG-PEG
   hydrogel, compatible tagged bio-functional building blocks, including
   RGD peptides or matrix metalloproteinase sensitive domains, can be
   incorporated on demand allowing the three-dimensional culture and
   expansion of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC5). The
   binding of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) in a CS concentration
   dependent manner and the BMP-2 release mediated osteogenic
   differentiation of BM-MSCs indicate the potential of CS-PEG hybrid
   hydrogels to promote regeneration of bone tissue. Their modular design
   allows facile incorporation of additional signaling elements, rendering
   CS-PEG hydrogels a highly flexible platform with potential for multiple
   biomedical applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Impacts of large-scale wind and solar power integration on California's

Abstract = {{Integration of wind- and solar-based generation into the electric grid
   has significantly grown over the past decade and is expected to grow to
   unprecedented levels in coming years. Several jurisdictions have set
   high targets for renewable energy integration. While electric grid
   operators have managed the variable and non-dispatchable nature of wind
   and solar power at current levels, large-scale integration of these
   resources would pose new challenges. In particular, the variable nature
   of wind and solar may lead to new electric grid operation and planning
   procedures. Net load in electric grids is defined as the conventional
   load minus the non-dispatchable generation. Net load is the basis of
   operation planning in day-to-day delivery of electricity to the
   consumers. With large-scale integration of wind and solar power, the net
   load in the system would be significantly affected. In this paper, we
   focus on characteristics of net load in electric grids when a large
   amount of wind and solar power generation is integrated into the grid.
   We use the data from California's power system. California intends to
   produce 33\% of its electricity from renewable resources by 2020, 80\%
   of which is expected to come from wind and solar power. We use both
   historical data and simulated scenarios of future wind and solar power
   generation. For future scenarios, we use the data provided by National
   Renewable Energy Laboratory to generate wind and solar power integration
   scenarios for years 2018 and 2023. The simulated net load data are
   analyzed from a variety of perspectives, such as average daily shapes,
   load and net load factor, duration curves, volatility, and hourly ramps.
   The results showed that compared to conventional load, characteristics
   of net load would be significantly different and need to be taken into
   account when designing measures and mechanisms for operating electric
   grids with (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{APR 27}},
Abstract = {{Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture is a process that can significantly reduce
   the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. In this study, several solid
   sorbents were examined for their CO2 capturing performance over 30
   carbonation-calcination cycles. The sorbents included natural calcined
   Cadomin limestone (denoted as CD), hydrated calcined Cadomin pellets
   (denoted as CP), core/shell sorbets with CD and CP as cores, and
   mesostructured silica (denoted as CD@Si and CP@Si, respectively) and
   titania (denoted as CD@Ti and CP@Ti) as shells. The core/shell sorbents
   were prepared with a protective porous shell using the mesoporous silica
   and titania layers. The surface morphology and porosity of all sorbents
   were qualified using scanning electron microscopy and were quantified
   using nitrogen physisorption. X-ray diffraction was also used to
   identify the crystal phase composition of the sorbents before and after
   calcination. The CP@Ti pellets showed the best performance in the
   retention of CO2 uptake over 30 cycles with an activity loss of 50.9\%.
   This is attributed to the formation of a protective layer of thermally
   stable mesoporous titania using a sol gel method, which prevented the
   aggregation of CaO crystals and sorbent sintering. Although the modified
   core/shell sorbents exhibited an improvement in maintaining the
   stability of the cyclic operation compared to natural limestone, further
   study is needed to understand the core/shell sintering phenomenon at
   high temperatures using other novel materials.}},

Abstract = {{The recovery of oil spilled on land or water has become an important
   issue due to environmental regulations. Canadian biomasses as fibrous
   materials are naturally renewable and have the potential to absorb
   oil-spills at different ranges. In this work, four Canadian biomasses
   were examined in order to evaluate their oil affinities and study
   parameters that could affect oil affinity when used as sorbent, such as
   average particle size, surface coating and reusability. Moreover, one
   oil sorption model was adopted and coupled with another developed model
   to approximate and verify the experimental findings of the oil sorbent
   biomasses. At an average particle size of 150-1000 mu m, results showed
   that barley straw biomass had the highest absorbency value at 6.07 g/g,
   while flax straw had the lowest value at 3.69 g/g. Wheat and oat straws
   had oil absorbency values of 5.49 and 5.00 g/g, respectively. An average
   particle size of 425-600 mu m indicated better absorbency values for oat
   and wheat straws. Furthermore, the thermal stability study revealed
   major weight recovery for two flame retardant coatings at hemicellulose
   and lignocellulose degradation temperature ranges. It was also found
   that oat straw biomass could be regenerated and used for many
   sorption/desorption cycles, as the reusability experiment showed only a
   18.45\% reduction in the oil absorbency value after six consecutive
   cycles. The developed penetration absorbency (PA) model showed oat straw
   adsorbed oil at the inter-particle level; and, the results of the
   sorption capacity model coupled with the PA model excellently predicted
   the oil sorption of raw and coated oat straws. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Determining binding of sulfonamide antibiotics to CTABr micelles using

Abstract = {{Membrane filtration processes such as ultrafiltration are increasingly
   employed in industrial and municipal wastewater treatment. However,
   these filtration processes are usually poor for removing low molecular
   weight organic and inorganic contaminants. Micellar enhanced
   ultrafiltration (MEUF), where contaminants first partition into micellar
   phases prior to removal by ultrafiltration, has been shown to be an
   effective removal technique for a variety of trace contaminants in
   wastewater. To characterize or predict the removal efficiency of MEUF,
   it is important to have a quantitative measure of the extent to which a
   species is able to bind to a micelle as well as to develop an
   understanding of the dynamics of the binding interactions.
   Herein, we report micellar binding constants for a series of sulfonamide
   antibiotics (sulfadoxine, sulfathiazole, sulfamethoxazole,
   sulfamerazine, sulfadiazine, sulfamethazine, sulfacetamide,
   sulfaguanidine, and sulfanilamide) with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide
   (CTABr) micelles, as determined using a semi -equilibrium dialysis
   method. Sulfadoxine, sulfathiazole and sulfamethoxazole exhibited the
   strongest tendency to bind to CTABr micelles, indicating that they
   possessed greater potential for removal via MEUF than did sulfanilamide
   or sulfaguanidine, which displayed little affinity for binding with
   CTABr micelles.
   Linear free energy plots of LogK(B) (in CTABr) versus LogK(ow) and
   pK(a2) values indicated that there was a weak correlation between
   binding and LogK(ow) and a stronger correlation with pK(a2) for these
   compounds, likely reflecting the stronger binding of ionizable
   sulfonamide molecules in the anionic form by the cationic micelles. (c)

Abstract = {{Knowledge is one of the fundamental cognitive objects in the brain among
   those of data, information, and intelligence. Knowledge can be
   classified into two main categories, i.e., conceptual knowledge for
   knowing to-be and behavioral knowledge for knowing to-do, particularly
   the former. This paper presents a basic study on a mathematical theory
   of knowledge towards knowledge science. The taxonomy and cognitive
   foundations of knowledge are explored, which reveal that the basic
   cognitive structure of conceptual knowledge is a formal concept and that
   of behavioral knowledge is a formal process. Mathematical models of
   knowledge are created in order to enable formal representation and
   rigorous manipulation of knowledge. A set of formal principles and
   properties of knowledge is elicited and elaborated towards the
   development of knowledge science and cognitive knowledge systems. It is
   discovered that the basic unit of knowledge is a binary relation,
   shortly bir, as a counterpart of bit (a binary digit) for information

Abstract = {{Registration is an essential procedure for merging point clouds defined
   in different coordinate systems associated to different scanner
   positions and orientations. It is usually the first step before the
   point clouds are further processed to provide spatial information of a
   scene to support engineering applications. In this paper, a new
   automatic registration method based on a novel geometric model of a
   polygonal object is presented. Since the cross section of the shaft of
   many lamp poles is octagonal, registration based on an octagonal pyramid
   model is proposed. The presented method only requires a single, common
   octagonal lamp pole observed in both point clouds, though actual overlap
   of the point clouds is not strictly required. It can be performed as
   long as the model parameters can be estimated by fitting the point
   observations to the model. Moreover, no user interaction is needed to
   derive approximate values, so the proposed registration can be
   completely automated. Three independent datasets captured by two
   scanners were used to verify the method. The registration accuracies in
   the horizontal and vertical directions were up to 11.7 mm and 4.4 mm at
   approximately 62 m and 17 m away from the scanner, respectively. With
   such high accuracies, the estimated registration parameters can serve as
   a set of initial parameters for fine registration using algorithm such
   as the iterative closest point (ICP).}},

Abstract = {{Bicycle helmet foam liners absorb energy during impacts. Our goal was to
   determine if the impact attenuation properties of expanded polystyrene
   (EPS) foam used in bicycle helmets change with age. Foam cores were
   extracted from 63 used and unused bicycle helmets from ten different
   models spanning an age range of 2-20 yrs. All cores were impact tested
   at a bulk strain rate of 195 s(-1). Six dependent variables were
   determined from the stress-strain curve derived from each impact (yield
   strain, yield stress, elastic modulus, plateau slope, energy at 65\%
   compression, and stress at 65\% compression), and a general linear model
   was used to assess the effect of age on each dependent variable with
   density as a covariate. Age did not affect any of the dependent
   variables; however, greater foam density, which varied from 58 to 100
   kg/m(3), generated significant increases in all of the dependent
   variables except for yield strain. Higher density foam cores also
   exhibited lower strains at which densification began to occur, tended to
   stay within the plateau region of the stress-strain curve, and were not
   compressed as much compared with the lower density cores. Based on these
   data, the impact attenuation properties of EPS foam in field-used
   bicycle helmets do not degrade with the age.}},

Abstract = {{Multistatic passive radars localize targets by using multiple bistatic
   range measurements. Multistatic localization requires all range
   measurements to be unbiased. It is proved by real data processing that
   registration is an important topic to be addressed. Traditionally,
   atomic clocks or GPS are used to achieve unbiased measurements. However,
   these approaches are unattainable under the case of multistatic passive
   radars as the transmitters of opportunity are beyond control. This paper
   proposes a novel registration method using noncooperative targets. The
   global convergence and accuracy of the proposed algorithm are obtained
   analytically. Computer simulations and experimental data are used to
   verify that the proposed algorithm possesses a good global convergence
   behavior and the performance can approach the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB).}},

Abstract = {{Underground coal gasification (UCG) is an emerging energy technology for
   a cleaner type of coal extraction method. It avoids current coal mining
   challenges such as drastic changes to landscapes, high machinery costs,
   elevated risks to personnel, and post-extraction transport. UCG has a
   huge potential to provide a clean coal energy source by implementing
   carbon capture and storage techniques as part of the process. In order
   to support mitigation strategies for clean coal production and policy
   development, much research needs to be completed. One component of this
   information is the need to understand what happens when the coal burns
   and a subsurface cavity is formed. This paper looks at the efforts to
   enhance reliable prediction of the size and shape of the cavities.
   Reactions are one of the most important mechanisms that control the rate
   of the growth of the cavities. Therefore, modeling the reactions and
   precise prediction of reaction kinetics can influence the accuracy of a
   UCG process. The produced syngas composition during UCG is closely
   linked to the reactions that take place in this process, the
   permeability of the coal seam, and the temperature distribution. Since
   the combination of reactions can influence the distributions of the heat
   and gas components in the coal seam during UCG or even extinguish the
   combustion, accurate modeling of the reactions is crucial, particularly
   when all phenomena affecting the reaction rate are considered in a
   single set of kinetics. In this study, procedures are proposed to
   estimate the frequency factor and activation energy of the pyrolysis
   reaction using a single-step decomposition method, the kinetics of the
   endothermic direction of homogeneous reversible reactions, and the
   frequency factor of heterogeneous reactions from experiments or
   literature data. The estimated kinetics is more appropriate for
   simulation of the UCG process using the porous medium approach. Computer
   Modelling Group's CMG-STARS (Steam, Thermal, and Advanced Processes
   Reservoir Simulator) software is used in this study.}},

Title = {{Experimental investigation of gas production processes in shale}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{159}},
Pages = {{30-47}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Shale gas formations are complex and heterogeneous systems, with both
   organic and inorganic content. Shale gas is contained in porous
   reservoirs in three forms: as free gas in the matrix pores and
   natural.fractures, as adsorbed gas on the surfaces of pores within
   organic matter and clay minerals, and as dissolved gas in kerogen.
   Identifying the relative proportions of the three different forms of gas
   in the production stream is important to the design of effective
   production strategies. In this paper, we performed gas production tests
   for four shale gas core samples with the same initial gas-in-place, but
   to different production pressure levels, to evaluate the contributions
   of the three different forms of gas to the ultimate gas production. The
   cumulative production curves exhibited several stages, representing
   different gas production processes. Production of compressed free gas,
   adsorbed gas, and dissolved gas were identified from the slopes of the
   cumulative gas production versus time curves. For the shale gas core
   samples tested, it was found that a portion of the adsorbed gas as well
   as a portion of the dissolved gas is not producible when the production
   pressure was above a certain value. The contributions of free gas,
   adsorbed gas, and dissolved gas to the cumulative gas production varied
   with the production pressure. Through the analysis of controlling
   factors, the free gas production has no correlation with total organic
   content (TOC), shale desorption properties, or stress sensitivity of
   permeability. At high production pressures, the adsorbed gas production
   is primarily affected by the shale desorption properties, while, at low
   production pressures, the adsorbed gas production is primarily affected
   by the stress sensitivity of permeability. And, although TOC can
   significantly increase the adsorbed gas content, the adsorbed gas
   production percentage of gas-in-place and TOC exhibit no correlation.

Title = {{Water distribution characteristic and effect on methane adsorption
   capacity in shale clay}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{159}},
Pages = {{135-154}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Methane adsorption in shale is a gas-liquid-solid interaction rather
   than a gas-solid interaction by considering the initial water saturation
   in actual condition. As an important constituent of inorganic matter,
   clay minerals may affect gas-in-place of shale systems. Generally, Clay
   minerals are strongly hydrophilic with a water film bound on its
   surface, significantly reducing gas sorption capacity, which will lead
   to overestimate gas-in-place (GIP) of shale gas reservoir. In this work,
   we analyze the interactions between methane, water film and clay, and
   results reveal that: methane adsorption on clay (dry) is a typical
   gas-solid interaction; however, methane adsorption on clay bound water
   film should belong to gas-liquid interaction. Furthermore, a unified
   model is established to describe gas-water-clay interactions, in which,
   gas-solid Langmuir equation and gas-liquid Gibbs equation are integrated
   by water coverage coefficient. Meanwhile, a mathematical model is
   presented to quantify thickness of water films by considering surface
   force interactions between liquid film and clay. Our results show that,
   the water film thickness in shale clay pores mainly depends on relative
   humidity and pore size. Under a certain humidity condition (such as
   0.98), the water saturation distribute in different sized pores mainly
   as: (i) capillary water in the small pores (<6 nm); (ii) water film in
   the larger pores. Thus, considering the water distribution
   characteristics, the effect of moisture on methane adsorption capacity
   is mainly for two aspects: (i) small pores (<6 nm) blocked by water are
   invalid for methane adsorption, (ii) large pores bounded by water film
   change interaction characteristics for methane adsorption (from
   gas-solid interaction to the gas liquid interaction). The overall effect
   could reduce the adsorption capacity by 80\%-90\%. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{Blasingame decline type curves with material balance pseudo-time
   modified for multi-fractured horizontal wells in shale gas reservoirs}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{31}},
Pages = {{340-350}},

Abstract = {{Production decline analysis has been considered as a robust method to
   obtain the flow parameters, reservoir properties and original gas in
   place. Although advanced Blasingame production decline analysis methods
   for vertical wells, fractured wells and horizontal wells in conventional
   reservoirs are widely used, there is no Blasingame production decline
   type curves for multi-fractured horizontal wells (MFHW) with considering
   stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) in shale gas reservoirs yet. Compared
   with conventional gas reservoirs, multi-flow mechanisms (such as Darcy
   flow, diffusion. and adsorption/desorption) and complex flow behaviors
   of MFHW exist in shale gas reservoirs, bringing a big challenge for
   analyzing the rate decline performance of the wells. Thus, in this paper
   based on the material balance equation in consideration of
   adsorption/desorption, the material balance pseudo-time of Blasingame
   decline type curves is modified so as to extend the theory of Blasingame
   production decline analysis to shale gas reservoirs. Considering the
   nonlinearity caused by gas desorption and diffusion, and the complex
   flow of MFHW, a numerical method is applied in this paper to obtain
   Blasingame type curves. Based on the perpendicular bisection (PEBI)
   grids, a numerical model considered SRV is developed and the solution is
   obtained using control volume finite element method and the fully
   implicit method. Further Blasingame type curve is validated by a
   simplify model, and Blasingame production decline type curves of the
   MFHW considering SRV in a shale gas reservoir are plotted through
   computer programming. Five flow regimes, including early formation
   linear flow, early radial flow, compound linear flow, the second radial
   flow and pseudo-steady flow, are recognized. Compared with the modified
   Blasingame type curves presented in this paper, the ones with
   traditional pseudo-time have a tendency to underestimate the value of
   normalized rate, normalized cumulative production, normalized integral
   derivative cumulative production and the reserve. The effects of
   relevant parameters including SRV radius, outer region radius,
   permeability in SRV region and outer region, Langmuir pressure, Langmuir
   volume and diffusion coefficient on type curves are analyzed as well.
   This work expands our understanding of a MFHW flow behaviors in shale
   gas reservoirs, which can be used to estimate with reservoir properties,
   SRV, and reserves in these types of reservoirs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

   particularly in fractured tight gas reservoirs. In the presence of
   natural fractures, leakoff behavior in these reservoirs shows
   characteristics of dual leakoff and pressure dependence, which is
   totally different from that in conventional reservoirs. Available models
   in the literature do not address these characteristics.
   In this paper, continuing from our previous studies, we further study
   the leakoff characteristics in fractured tight gas reservoirs in depth.
   A leakoff conceptual model is proposed with consideration of three
   leakoff media. The mathematical models in different media are developed
   by considering the influence of stress sensitivity. Based on this
   conceptual model, an equivalent leakoff coefficient is derived.
   Simulation results performed are consistent with field observations. The
   equivalent leakoff coefficient is also validated to reflect the
   characteristics of leakoff. The influence of multiple factors on leakoff
   is studied in detail, indicating that with an increase in the
   permeability, compressibility, density and pressure, the leakoff
   velocity increases, and these parameters have a linear relationship with
   cumulative leakoff, while with an increase in fracturing fluid
   viscosity, the leakoff velocity decreases, and it has a power function
   relationship with cumulative leakoff. After considering the stress
   sensitivity, both the leakoff velocity and cumulative leakoff increase,
   and the increasing magnitudes depend on pressure, especially in macro
   natural fractures. Furthermore, a pressure distribution curve also
   changes from concave to convex with consideration of stress sensitivity
   in macro natural fractures. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Nanopores to megafractures: Current challenges and methods for shale gas

Abstract = {{The past two decades have seen a tremendous focus by energy companies on
   the development of shale gas resources in North America, resulting in an
   over-supply of natural gas to the North American market in recent years.
   This shale gas ``revolution{''} was made possible primarily through the
   application of drilling and completion technologies, particularly
   horizontal wells completed in multiple hydraulic fracturing stages
   (multi-fractured horizontal wells, or MFHWs). While these technologies
   have proven successful in commercializing the resource, imperfect
   understanding of basic shale gas reservoir properties, and methods used
   to characterize them, has perhaps led to inefficiencies in shale gas
   resource development and recovery that can be improved over time with
   further research.
   The purpose of the current work is to 1) provide an overview of shale
   gas storage and transport mechanisms 2) summarize the challenges
   associated with evaluating key reservoir and hydraulic fracture
   properties and 3) discuss recent advances by the authors in the area of
   shale gas reservoir and hydraulic fracture characterization. For the
   latter topic, advances in multi-scale characterization techniques, from
   reservoir sample evaluation to production data analysis will be
   addressed, however an emphasis will be placed specifically on methods to
   evaluate reservoir and rock properties along the length of the
   horizontal well to enable selection of hydraulic fracture stage
   placement and improved well forecasting. Rock cuttings retrieved during
   drilling are typically the only reservoir samples obtained from
   horizontal wells, and therefore methods for quantitative assessment of
   pore structure, gas content, gas in-place, permeability, fluid-rock
   interaction, and rock mechanical property assessment will be discussed.
   In particular, the following recent innovations by the authors are
   highlighted: 1) use of the Simplified Local Density (SLD) model to
   account for fluid property alteration from pore confinement, and to
   predict high-pressure gas adsorption from low-pressure adsorption data
   collected for small amounts of cuttings samples 2) extraction of
   permeability/diffusivity from low-pressure adsorption rate data, also
   collected for small amounts of cuttings samples 3) use of a variable
   pressure, environmental SEM to assess fluid distribution and
   micro-wettability to support pore-scale modeling studies 4) estimation
   of unpropped hydraulic fracture permeability through generation of
   fractures in core plugs under stress 5) use of microhardness tests to
   evaluate fine scale changes in ``mechanical stratigraphy{''} and 6) use
   of sonic core-holders to provide measurements of dynamic rock mechanical
   properties for shale samples subject to in-situ stress. Modification of
   diagnostic fracture injection tests (DFITs), a common well-testing
   technique performed on shales to derive reservoir property and stress
   information but performed usually only at the toe of horizontal wells,
   to enable tests to be performed at multiple points along a horizontal
   well, will be proposed. Finally, advances in production analysis methods
   to account for effects such as pore confinement, relative permeability,
   and stress-dependent permeability will be reviewed, as will techniques
   for extracting hydraulic fracture properties through analysis of
   flowback data.
   It is hoped that this summary will provide geoscientists and engineers
   with a comprehensive overview of shale gas reservoir and hydraulic
   fracture evaluation challenges and potential solutions, with a view to
   enabling more efficient shale gas extraction. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In this work, two novel inhibitors containing multi-functional groups
   were developed, and their inhibition performance for corrosion of X65
   pipeline steel in CO2-saturated oilfield formation water was
   investigated using electrochemical measurements, surface
   characterization, and scanning vibrating electrode technique. Moreover,
   the inhibitors and the inhibition mechanism were further investigated by
   electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance and x-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy. The inhibitors are able to decrease the corrosion rate of
   the steel in the solution by over 100 times at a concentration of 3.2 x
   10(-3) M, and the inhibition efficiency can exceed 98\% for each
   inhibitor. The inhibitors are mixed-type ones, reducing both anodic and
   cathodic current densities, while the corrosion potential remains
   essentially constant. Corrosion inhibition is attributed to the
   formation, on the surface, of a film that consists of an insoluble
   complex containing inhibitor film and ferrous scale. The corrosion
   inhibition of the added inhibitor is more effective for the corroded
   electrode than for the freshly prepared steel electrode. This is
   attributed to the formation of the complex film by reactions of the
   inhibitor molecules and the pre-formed corrosion scale, and this film is
   more effective than the adsorptive inhibitor film for corrosion
   inhibition.}},

Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{128-146}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Extensive work exists on regular rail network planning. However, few
   studies exist on the planning and design of ring-radial rail transit
   systems. With more ring transit lines being planned and built in Asia,
   Europe and the America's, a detailed study on ring transit lines is
   timely. An analytical model to find the optimal number of radial lines
   in a city for any demand distribution is first introduced. Secondly,
   passenger route choice for different rail networks is analyzed, for a
   many-to-many Origin-Destination (OD) demand distribution, based on a
   total travel time cost per passenger basis. The routes considered are:
   (1) radial lines only; (2) ring line only or radial lines and ring line
   combined; or (3) direct access to a destination without using the rail
   system. Mathematica and Matlab are used to code the route choice model.
   A cost-benefit optimization model to identify the feasibility and
   optimality of a ring line is proposed. Unlike simulations and
   agent-based models, this model is shown to be easily transferable to
   many ring-radial transit networks. The City of Calgary is used as an
   example to illustrate the applicability of each model. The existing
   urban rail network and trip distribution are major influencing factors
   in judging the feasibility and optimal location of the ring line. This
   study shows the potential net benefit of introducing a ring line by
   assessing changes in passengers' costs. The changes in passenger cost
   parameters, such as ride cost and access cost, are shown to greatly
   influence the feasibility of a ring line. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Cavitation Inception in Crossflow Hydro Turbines}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Cavitation is a common flow phenomena in most hydraulic turbines and has
   the potential to cause vibration, blade surface damage and performance
   loss. Despite the fact that crossflow turbines have been used in
   small-scale hydropower systems for a long time, cavitation has not been
   studied in these turbines. In this paper, we present the findings of a
   computational study on cavitation inception in crossflow turbines.
   Cavitation inception was assessed using three-dimensional ( 3D)
   Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes ( RANS) computations. A homogeneous,
   free-surface two-phase flow model was used. Pressure distributions on
   the blades were examined for different flow rates, heads and impeller
   speeds to assess cavitation inception. The results showed that
   cavitation occurs in the second stage of the turbine and was observed on
   the suction side near the inner edge of the blades. For the particular
   turbine studied, cavitation always occurred at shaft speeds greater than
   that, giving the maximum efficiency for each combination of flow rate
   and head. The implication is that the useful operating range of
   crossflow turbines is up to and including the maximum efficiency point.}},

Abstract = {{Expanding solvent steam assisted gravity drainage (ES-SAGD) is a hybrid
   steam-solvent oil recovery process that can be used to extract oil from
   heavy oil and bitumen reservoirs. It is a variation of the SAGD process
   in which only steam is used. In ES-SAGD, the mobilization of highly
   viscous oil is enhanced through a combination of heat and mass transfer
   processes, which results in significantly reduced volumes of water and
   natural gas needed to generate the injected steam, making ES-SAGD more
   energy efficient and environmentally sustainable relative to SAGD. Both
   SAGD and ES-SAGD use the same well configuration, and solvent
   co-injection in existing SAGD projects often requires limited facility
   modifications. This study investigates different aspects of ES-SAGD
   experimentally, based on typical Long Lake reservoir properties and
   operating conditions, using different concentrations of gas condensate.
   Furthermore, this study provides phase behavior insights to govern the
   selection of appropriate solvents for use in ES-SAGD. The performance of
   the gas condensate ES-SAGD cases in this study exceeded that of the
   baseline SAGD case in terms of oil production rates, energy efficiency,
   and postproduction water handling. These findings were instrumental in
   the design and implementation of a field pilot project by Nexen Energy
   ULC in the Athabasca Oil Sands that began in September 2014.}},

Abstract = {{To prepare the solubilized asphaltene in water (SAW), the feedstock of
   hydroprocessing experiments, oxidation reactions were conducted in a 550
   mL batch reactor in the presence of NaOH in aqueous phase. At 240
   degrees C and 2 h residence time the asphaltenes conversion reached 80\%
   with 50\% yield to SAW. The characterization of solubilized asphaltene
   in water (SAW) revealed that it contains a wide range of carboxylic
   acids with various alkyl tails. The presence of carboxylate and
   carboxylic functional groups in the SAW structure was also confirmed
   with FTIR analyses. The catalytic hydroprocessing of SAW was studied in
   a 100 mL batch reactor with presulfided NiMo/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst. The
   hydroprocessing results at 320 degrees C and 3 h residence time for SAW
   prepared at different severities shows that higher oxidation temperature
   produces the lighter liquid hydrocarbons, which suggests the
   oxy-cracking of asphaltene through wet oxidation. Increasing the
   concentration of solubilized asphaltene in water increased solids
   formation in hydroprocessing from 12.5\% for nonconcentrated SAW to 26\%
   for 10 times concentrated solution. The hydrogen deficiency was
   evidenced in hydroprocessing of high concentrated SAW, where increasing
   the initial hydrogen pressure from 600 psig to 1000 psig suppressed the
   solid formation from 26\% to 9.5\%. Liquid products from hydroprocessing
   mainly consisted of two cyclohexyl fused hydrocarbons with higher
   selectivity to naphthenic and lower selectivity to aromatic compounds.
   Detecting CO2 as a major component in the gas phase in parallel with the
   results of GC/MS before and after hydroprocessing confirms that oxygen
   removal is dominated by decarboxylation.}},

Title = {{A Novel Method to Enhance Pipeline Trajectory Determination Using
   Pipeline Junctions}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Pipeline inspection gauges (pigs) have been used for many years to
   perform various maintenance operations in oil and gas pipelines.
   Different pipeline parameters can be inspected during the pig journey.
   Although pigs use many sensors to detect the required pipeline
   parameters, matching these data with the corresponding pipeline location
   is considered a very important parameter. High-end, tactical-grade
   inertial measurement units (IMUs) are used in pigging applications to
   locate the detected problems of pipeline using other sensors, and to
   reconstruct the trajectories of the pig. These IMUs are accurate;
   however, their high cost and large sizes limit their use in small
   diameter pipelines (8{''} or less). This paper describes a new
   methodology for the use of MEMS-based IMUs using an extended Kalman
   filter (EKF) and the pipeline junctions to increase the position
   parameters' accuracy and to reduce the total RMS errors even during the
   unavailability of above ground markers (AGMs). The results of this new
   proposed method using a micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS)-based
   IMU revealed that the position RMS errors were reduced by approximately
   85\% compared to the standard EKF solution. Therefore, this approach
   will enable the mapping of small diameter pipelines, which was not
   possible before.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainable building rooftop technologies, such as white roofs, green
   roofs, and photovoltaic(s) (PV) panels, are becoming increasingly
   implemented as a result of their associated environmental benefits.
   Studies of these rooftop technologies are often located in hot climates
   and do not assess their full environmental consequences. Further,
   current studies tend to focus on one technology and often do not
   evaluate the full range of technology options using a systematic
   framework with common assumptions and boundaries. This article evaluates
   the environmental performance on a life cycle basis of white roofs,
   green roofs, and roof-mounted PV in the cold Canadian climate. Solar PV
   demonstrates the highest environmental performance in all impact
   categories considered (see complete list in Results section) and is the
   preferred option from an environmental perspective. Green roofs result
   in beneficial environmental impacts, although much less significant than
   those obtained with PV, and are the only rooftop technology that reduces
   both heating and cooling energy use. The environmental performance of
   white roofs in cold climates is strongly affected by the heating penalty
   (i.e., the increase in heating energy use resulting from the high solar
   reflectance). Although white roofs have been proven an outstanding
   option in warmer climates, in cold climates, net negative environmental
   impacts lead to white roof technology not being recommended for general
   applications in cold climates. A sensitivity analysis shows that the
   conclusions in this study provide robust insights across Canada and cold
   climates in general.}},

Abstract = {{The main challenge of intramedullary nail (IM-nail) fixation surgery is
   to achieve the X-ray shot in which the distal holes of the IM-nail
   appear as circles (desired view); screw insertion is then performed.
   Although C-arm X-ray devices are routinely used in IM-nail fixation
   procedures, the surgeons or radiation technologists (rad-techs) usually
   utilize them in a trial-and-error manner. This increases both radiation
   exposure and surgery time. This study addresses the problem by
   presenting a C-arm-based IM-nail pose recognition method.
   The specific purpose of this study was to develop and validate an
   automated technique for identifying the current pose of the IM-nail
   relative to the C-arm. An accuracy assessment is performed to test the
   reliability of the navigation results. The algorithm starts with a
   sequential biplanar set of X-ray imagery (acquired from a tracked C-arm)
   of the distal part of an inserted IM-nail. The image-processing module
   then extracts features of interest, and a mathematical model
   incorporates them to calculate the six degree-of-freedom position and
   orientation parameters of the nail.
   Translational accuracy was demonstrated to be better than 0.5 mm,
   rotational accuracy for roll and pitch to be better than and for yaw to
   be better than depending on the separation angle. Computation time was
   less than 0.5 s.
   An IM-nail distal locking navigation technique is introduced in this
   study that leads to more accurate and faster screw placement with a
   lower consumption of radiation dose and a minimum number of added steps
   to the operation.}},

Abstract = {{Software test processes are complex and costly. To reduce testing effort
   without compromising effectiveness and product quality, automation of
   test activities has been adopted as a popular approach in software
   industry. However, because test automation usually requires substantial
   upfront investments, automation is not always more cost-effective than
   manual testing. To support decision-makers in finding the optimal degree
   of test automation in a given project, we recently proposed a process
   simulation model using the System Dynamics modeling technique and used
   the simulation model in the context of a case study with a software
   company in Calgary, Canada. With the help of the simulation model, we
   were able to evaluate the performance of test processes with varying
   degrees of automation of test activities and help testers choose the
   most optimal cases. The goal of the earlier study was to investigate how
   the simulation model can help decision-makers decide whether and to what
   degree the company should automate their test processes. In this
   article, we present further details of the System Dynamics model, its
   usage scenarios and examples of simulation experiments independent from

Abstract = {{Proteoglycan 4 (PRG4) is a mucin-like glycoprotein present in synovial
   fluid and at the surface of articular cartilage. The objectives of this
   study were to (1) assess the articular cartilage surface adsorption and
   in vitro cartilage boundary lubricating ability of full-length
   recombinant human PRG4 (rhPRG4), and (2) cartilage boundary lubricating
   ability of purified rhPRG4, both alone and in combination with
   hyaluronan (HA). rhPRG4 adsorption onto articular cartilage explants was
   assessed by immunohistochemistry and dot blot. An in vitro
   cartilage-cartilage friction test was used to assess rhPRG4's cartilage
   boundary lubricating ability compared to bovine PRG4, and that of
   purified rhPRG4 both alone and in combination with HA. rhPRG4 was able
   to adsorb to the articular surface, as well as the cut surface, of
   cartilage explants. The kinetic coefficient of friction of rhPRG4 was
   similar to that of PRG4 (p = 0.16) and lower than phosphate-buffered
   saline (p < 0.05), while that of purified rhPRG4 + HA was significantly
   lower than rhPRG4 alone (p < 0.05). This study demonstrates that rhPRG4
   can adsorb to an intact articular cartilage surface and functions as an
   effective boundary lubricant, both alone and with HA, and provides the
   foundation for in vivo evaluation of this clinically relevant
   full-length rhPRG4 for treatment of osteoarthritis.}},

Abstract = {{Reliable relative permeability curves are important for successful
   reservoir simulation and modeling. These curves may be available on fine
   scale models. However, detailed descriptions demand a huge amount memory
   and processing time. Therefore, it is needed to upscale core-size
   relative permeability curves measured by laboratory experiments to a
   scale suitable for the various types of simulation. This upscaling is
   accomplished with pseudo functions. In this work, a new automatic
   history matching algorithm based on B-spline representation was applied
   to estimate pseudo relative permeability curves. The performance the
   generated pseudo curves were compared with four dynamic pseudo functions
   for a 3D heterogeneous water-flooding case. In addition, the effect of
   the pseudo function estimation uncertainty on the cumulative oil
   production was investigated after 10 years of production. Results
   revealed that relative permeability curves obtained from history
   matching gives the best performance among other pseudos and this
   methodology can be used for reservoir simulation over periods beyond
   that of the original match. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Western Canadian oil sands reservoirs are among the largest petroleum
   accumulations in the world. Given original oil viscosity up to 5,000,000
   mPa-s, these oils are currently recovered from these reservoirs using
   steam which heats the oil to approximate to 250 degrees C with reduced
   viscosities <10 mPa-s. A key issue faced by thermal recovery processes
   is the uniformity of the steam chamber within the reservoir.
   Nonuniformities of the chamber arise from multiphase flow instabilities
   in the porous media where fingering has been explained by penetration of
   low viscosity steam into viscous oil. Here, fine-grid thermal reservoir
   simulation reveals that fingering takes place in the gas phase beyond
   the chamber edge in a zone created by gas exsolution due to elevated
   temperature beyond the edge of the steam chamber. The results suggest
   that nonuniform chambers will occur in perfectly homogeneous reservoirs
   which implies that uniform chambers along wells may be impossible to
   achieve. (c) 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 62:

Abstract = {{This paper revisits the concept of an authentication machine (A-machine)
   that aims at identifying/verifying humans. Although A-machines in the
   closed-set application scenario are well understood and commonly used

   equally characterized. This paper presents an analysis and taxonomy of
   A-machines, trends, and challenges of open-set real-world applications.
   This paper makes the following contributions to the area of open-set
   A-machines: 1) a survey of applications; 2) new novel life cycle metrics
   for theoretical, predicted, and operational performance evaluation; 3) a
   new concept of evidence accumulation for risk assessment; 4) new
   criteria for the comparison of A-machines based on the notion of a
   supporting assistant; and 5) a new approach to border personnel training
   based on the A-machine training mode. It offers a technique for modeling
   A-machines using belief (Bayesian) networks and provides an example of

Abstract = {{A new transimpedance amplifier (TIA) design procedure using stagger
   tuning with inverted transformer coils is described in this paper. A
   broadband TIA, realized using the proposed staggered design technique
   that enhances the transimpedance limit and the bandwidth while only
   adding small passband gain ripple, was implemented in a 0.13-mu m
   standard CMOS process. The TIA achieves a 3-dB bandwidth of 33 GHz with
   a 150 fF photodiode capacitance. The TIA transimpedance gain is 43.8 dB
   Omega with +/-8 ps group-delay variation over the entire bandwidth. The
   circuit occupies an active area of 250 mu m x 260 mu m and consumes 9 mW
   from a 2 V supply. Despite operating with much larger photodiode
   capacitance, the TIA achieves the highest figure of merit, and occupies
   smaller area while consuming the least amount of power among previously
   published TIAs designed for the same data rate in similar technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) changes the knee joint in both intentional
   and unintentional, known and unknown, ways. Patellofemoral and
   tibiofemoral kinematics play an important role in postoperative pain,
   function, satisfaction and revision, yet are largely unknown.
   Preoperative kinematics, postoperative kinematics or changes in
   kinematics may help identify causes of poor clinical outcome.
   Patellofemoral kinematics are challenging to record since the patella is
   obscured by the metal femoral component in X-ray and moves under the
   skin. The purpose of this study was to determine the kinematic degrees
   of freedom having significant changes and to evaluate the variability in
   individual changes to allow future study of patients with poor clinical
   outcomes. We prospectively studied the 6 degrees of freedom
   patellofemoral and tibiofemoral weightbearing kinematics, tibiofemoral
   contact points and helical axes of rotation of nine subjects before and
   at least 1year after total knee arthroplasty using clinically available
   computed tomography and radiographic imaging systems. Normal kinematics
   for healthy individuals were identified from the literature. Significant
   differences existed between pre-TKA and post-TKA kinematics, with the
   post-TKA kinematics being closer to normal. While on average the
   pre-total knee arthroplasty knees in this group displayed no pivoting
   (only translation), individually only five knees displayed this
   behaviour (of these, two showed lateral pivoting, one showed medial
   pivoting and one showed central pivoting). There was considerable
   variability postoperatively as well (five central, two lateral and two
   medial pivoting). Both preop and postop, flexion behaviour was more
   hinge-like medially and more rolling laterally. Helical axes were more
   consistent postop for this group. An inclusive understanding of the
   pre-TKA and post-TKA kinematics and changes in kinematics due to total
   knee arthroplasty could improve implant design, patient diagnosis and
   surgical technique.}},

Abstract = {{Wedged insoles are prescribed for medial knee osteoarthritis to reduce
   the knee adduction moment; however, it is currently not possible to
   predict which patients will in fact experience reduced moments. The
   purpose of this study was to identify a simple method using
   two-dimensional data for predicting the expected change in knee
   adduction moments with wedged insoles. Knee adduction moments during
   walking were determined for healthy individuals (n=15) and individuals
   with medial knee osteoarthritis (n=19) while wearing their own shoe
   without an insole (control), with a 6-mm medial wedge and with a 6-mm
   lateral wedge. The percent changes relative to control were determined.
   Then, participants completed single-step trials with each footwear
   condition where only the changes in mediolateral positions of the knee
   joint center, shank center of mass, ankle joint center, and foot center
   of mass relative to control were determined. These variables were used
   as predictors in regression equations where the change in knee adduction
   moment during walking was the dependent variable. The change in
   mediolateral positions of the lower extremity during a single step
   significantly predicted the change in knee adduction moment during
   walking for the lateral wedge in both the healthy (R-2=0.72, p=0.008)
   and knee osteoarthritis (R-2=0.52, p=0.026) groups, and also for the
   medial wedge in both the healthy (R-2=0.67, p=0.016) and knee
   osteoarthritis (R-2=0.54, p=0.020) groups. The method of using
   mediolateral position data from a single-step movement to predict
   walking biomechanics was successful. These data are relatively simple to
   collect and analyze, offering the possibility for future incorporation
   into a wedge prediction system.}},

Title = {{A Prediction Region-based Approach to Model Uncertainty for

Abstract = {{Multi-response optimization methods rely on empirical process models
   based on the estimates of model parameters that relate response
   variables to a set of design variables. However, in determining the
   optimal conditions for the design variables, model uncertainty is
   typically neglected, resulting in an unstable optimal solution. This
   paper proposes a new optimization strategy that takes model uncertainty
   into account via the prediction region for multiple responses. To avoid
   obtaining an overly conservative design, the location and dispersion
   performances are constructed based on the best-case strategy and the
   worst-case strategy of expected loss. We reveal that the traditional
   loss function and the minimax/maximin strategy are both special cases of
   the proposed approach. An example is illustrated to present the
   procedure and the effectiveness of the proposed loss function. The
   results show that the proposed approach can give reasonable results when
   both the location and dispersion performances are important issues.

Abstract = {{Scene parsing, using both images and range data, is one of the key
   problems in computer vision and robotics. In this paper, a street scene
   parsing scheme that takes advantages of images from perspective cameras
   and range data from LiDAR is presented. First, pre-processing on the
   image set is performed and the corresponding point cloud is segmented
   according to semantics and transformed into an image pose. A graph
   matching approach is introduced into our parsing framework, in order to
   identify similar sub-regions from training and test images in terms of
   both local appearance and spatial structure. By using the sub-graphs
   inherited from training images, as well as the cues obtained from point
   clouds, this approach can effectively interpret the street scene via a
   guided MRF inference. Experimental results show a promising performance
   of our approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{84}},
Pages = {{34-46}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents the thermo-mechanical strength characterization of
   Colorado shale which serves as a cap rock to underlying oil-rich
   formations in Cold Lake area, east-central Alberta, Canada. Samples from
   the Westgate and Joli Fou formations were tested at high temperatures
   along triaxial compression stress paths with effective consolidation
   pressures and temperatures consistent with in-situ stresses and
   operative conditions. These lab tests were complemented with indirect
   tensile strength, unconfined compression and triaxial constant effective
   mean stress tests at ambient temperature for a more comprehensive
   knowledge of the material strength, particularly, at low confining
   pressures. The lab experimental results revealed brittle behavior of the
   tested shales with considerable strain softening. Both peak and
   post-peak strength envelopes of the tested material were observed to be
   nonlinear with a pronounced curvature at low mean stresses and to
   decrease at high temperatures. A simple thermo-mechanical failure
   criterion is proposed to capture the aforementioned constitutive
   features. This provides a modeling framework for determining the
   material strength close to the zone of tensile failure at different
   temperatures which is of utmost relevance to cap rock integrity
   assessments. Finally, measured axial and radial deformations as well as
   X-ray tomography images were used to verify that the observed constant
   rate of dilation in the post-peak response of the samples was a
   reflection of the morphology of the virtually smooth shear plane, and
   not representative of the material behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Travel demand is increasing in many countries and the transportation
   sector produces about 14\% of the global greenhouse gas emission, which
   has been linked to the current climate change. As the oil and gas
   capital of Canada, the City of Calgary has a very high carbon footprint
   per population. Hence, the increase usage of transit and the reduction
   of auto dependency is an important policy goal for the city, and
   understanding the determinants of transit ridership is a critical first
   step to achieving this goal. The objective of the study is to identify
   the effects of different street patterns, traffic, road infrastructure,
   socioeconomic and demographic characteristics on public transit
   ridership in 185 community areas of the city. Our results suggest that
   several street patterns have a significant effect on public transit
   usage and thus should be considered in the development of new
   communities for promoting public transit. Also, increases in commercial
   areas, expressways or highways and train stations are associated with
   greater transit use. In addition to these physical attributes, a number
   of socioeconomic and demographic characteristics related to income, age,
   living pattern and minority or immigrant populations are important
   determinants of public transit use.}},

Abstract = {{The catalytic performance of three NiMo catalysts supported on tailored
   activated carbon (AC) supports has been studied for the hydroprocessing
   of tire oil for sulfur removal and conversion of heavier fractions
   towards lighter naphtha and diesel production. The supports have been
   obtained through physical activation of petcoke for different times, and
   in some cases functionalized via acid treatment with HNO3. The
   hydroprocessing runs have been carried out in a fixed bed reactor
   working in trickle bed regime at 275-375 degrees C, 65 bar and a space
   time of 0.16 h. The catalyst properties have been measured by ICP-AES,
   N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, TPR, and tert-butylamine
   adsorption-desorption (TPD). A preliminary catalyst screening using a
   synthetic mixture of model compounds of tire oil was used to select the
   most active catalyst. This catalyst, which contained a support activated
   for 9 h and functionalized with HNO3, had an HDS conversion of up to
   99.9\%. In the hydroprocessing of real tire oil, the same NiMo/AC
   catalyst reached a steady sulfur removal of 96.3\% and a heavy gasoil
   lump removal higher than 11 wt\%, with complete olefin hydrogenation and
   a decreased content of naphthenes and aromatics in the products. The
   cetane number of the diesel fraction was also enhanced with this

Abstract = {{Nitrogen-doped multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNx-MWCNTs) with bamboo
   structures have been unzipped via a helical mechanism, and
   nitrogen-doped graphene oxide nanoribbons (CNx-GONRs) with a
   multifaceted microstructure have been obtained. CNx-GONRs have then been
   exposed to nitrogen and/or sulfur precursors at high temperatures to
   obtain doped graphene nanoribbons. The effects of single-doping,
   two-step-doping, and co-doping time and temperature on the concentration
   of the dopants and their functional groups have been investigated by
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The oxygen reduction reaction
   (ORR) activity of the doped helical GNRs have been measured in both
   alkaline and acidic electrolytes, and compared with the state-of-the-art
   platinum/carbon (Pt/C) electrocatalysts. The nitrogen/sulfur co-doped
   graphene nanoribbons (CNx/CSx-GNRs) with helically unzipped structures
   have shown highly efficient ORR activity that is comparable to Pt/C in
   onset potential, exchange current density, four electron pathway
   selectivity, kinetic current density, and methanol tolerance. Such
   helical CNx/CSx-GNRs will greatly contribute to the development of
   precious metal-free carbon nanomaterials as electrocatalysts in the

Abstract = {{In this work, the early-stage corrosion of a carbon steel with various
   surface roughness, which was created by different levels of surface
   finishing treatment, was characterized by an atomic force microscope and
   electrochemical measurements. It is found that the resulting surface
   roughness is at nano-meter scale. As the surface roughness increases,
   the corrosion activity of the steel is increased. The early-stage
   corrosion of the steel is featured with two stages of dissolution. While
   the first stage involves a rapid dissolution and increasing surface
   roughness of the steel, stage two is in an equilibrium state to have an
   approximately constant corrosion rate and surface roughness. Generally,
   the corrosion rate of the steel decreases when the surface finish of the
   specimen becomes finer. Local preferential corrosion occurs at surface
   irregularities, resulting in the deepening and widening of the features
   such as scratches with time. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   factors and the comprehensive toxic effects of phenol and TCE had been
   systematically studied. To further explore their potential at the level
   of microbial population and functions, phenol degraders were isolated
   and purified from mature granules in this study. Phenol and TCE
   degradation kinetics of 15 strains were determined, together with their
   TCE transformation capacities and other physiological characteristics.
   Isolation in the presence of phenol and TCE exerted stress on microbial
   populations, but the procedure was able to preserve their diversity.
   Wide variation was found with the isolates' kinetic behaviors, with the
   parameters often spanning 3 orders of magnitude. Haldane kinetics
   described phenol degradation well, and the isolates exhibited actual
   maximum phenol-dependent oxygen utilization rates of 9-449 mg DO g DW-1
   h(-1), in phenol concentration range of 4.8-406 mg L-1. Both
   Michaelis-Menten and Haldane types were observed for TCE transformation,
   with the actual maximum rate of 1.04-21.1 mg TCE g DW-1 h(-1) occurring
   between TCE concentrations of 0.42-4.90 mg L-1. The TCE transformation
   capacities and growth yields on phenol ranged from 20-115 mg TCE g DW-1
   and 0.46-1.22 g DW g phenol(-1), respectively, resulting in TCE
   transformation yields of 10-70 mg TCE g phenol(-1). Contact angles of
   the isolates were between 34 and 82, suggesting both hydrophobic and
   hydrophilic cell surface. The diversity in the isolates is a great
   advantage, as it enables granules to be versatile and adaptive under
   different operational conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Pages = {{422-428}},

Abstract = {{Accurately quantifying black carbon (BC) emission factors (EFs) is a
   prerequisite for estimation of BC emission inventory. BC EFs determined
   by measuring BC at the roadside or chasing a vehicle on-road may
   introduce large uncertainty for low emission vehicles. In this study, BC
   concentrations were measured inside the tailpipe of gasoline vehicles
   with different engine sizes under different driving modes to determine
   the respective EFs. BC EFs ranged from 0.005-7.14 mg/kg-fuel under the
   speeds of 20-70 km/h, 0.05-28.95 mg/kg-fuel under the accelerations of
   0.5-1.5 m/s(2). Although the water vapor in the sampling stream could
   result in an average of 12\% negative bias, the BC EFs are significantly
   lower than the published results obtained with roadside or chasing
   vehicle measurement. It is suggested to conduct measurement at the
   tailpipe of gasoline vehicles instead of in the atmosphere behind the
   vehicles to reduce the uncertainty from fluctuation in ambient BC
   concentration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A fractionated spacecraft is an innovative application of a distributive
   space system. To fully understand the impact of various uncertainties on
   its development, launch and in-orbit operation, we use the stochastic
   missioncycle cost to comprehensively evaluate the survivability,
   flexibility, reliability and economy of the ways of dividing the various
   modules of the different configurations of fractionated spacecraft. We
   systematically describe its concept and then analyze its evaluation and
   optimal design method that exists during recent years and propose the
   stochastic missioncycle cost for comprehensive evaluation. We also
   establish the models of the costs such as module development, launch and
   deployment and the impacts of their uncertainties respectively. Finally,
   we carry out the Monte Carlo simulation of the complete missioncycle
   costs of various configurations of the fractionated spacecraft under
   various uncertainties and give and compare the probability density
   distribution and statistical characteristics of its stochastic
   missioncycle cost, using the two strategies of timing module replacement
   and non-timing module replacement. The simulation results verify the
   effectiveness of the comprehensive evaluation method and show that our

Abstract = {{Structural optimization of Fe nanoclusters is of importance to their
   applications since their magnetic and catalytic properties are strongly
   dependent on their structures. In this article, the lowest-energy
   structures of Fe nanoclusters have been investigated using a
   multi-populations differential evolution algorithm. Finnis-Sinclair
   potentials and Johnson potentials have been, respectively, used to
   describe the interatomic interactions. The algorithm performance has
   been first evaluated by comparing the results of Finnis-Sinclair
   potentials with Cambridge Cluster Database. Two lower-energy structures
   of Fen clusters (N = 83 and 84) have been discovered. Our results show
   that many of the structural configurations optimized with the two
   potentials are different, indicating that the potential model plays an
   important role in structural optimization. However, the structures of Fe
   clusters exhibit the similar growth patterns as the cluster increasing
   for the two potentials, that is, their lowest-energy structures contain
   many icosahedra, and the number of the icosahedral rings increases with
   their sizes. Furthermore, the stability analysis by investigating the
   finite difference and the second finite difference of energy indicates
   that the two potentials predict the same relative stability at the magic
   numbers.

Abstract = {{Building extraction is one of the main research topics of the
   photogrammetry community. This paper presents automatic algorithms for
   building boundary extractions from aerial LiDAR data. First, segmenting
   height information generated from LiDAR data, the outer boundaries of
   aboveground objects are expressed as closed chains of oriented edge
   pixels. Then, building boundaries are distinguished from nonbuilding
   ones by evaluating their shapes. The candidate building boundaries are
   reconstructed as rectangles or regular polygons by applying new
   algorithms, following the hypothesis verification paradigm. These
   algorithms include constrained searching in Hough space, enhanced Hough
   transformation, and the sequential linking technique. The experimental
   results show that the proposed algorithms successfully extract building
   boundaries at rates of 97\%, 85\%, and 92\% for three LiDAR datasets

Abstract = {{Using Quinolin-65 (Q-65) as a model-adsorbing compound for polar heavy
   hydrocarbons, the nanosize effect of NiO nanoparticles on the adsorption
   of Q-65 was investigated. Different-sized NiO nanoparticles with sizes
   between 5 and 80 nm were prepared by the controlled thermal
   dehydroxylation of Ni(OH)(2). The properties of the nanoparticles were
   characterized using XRD, BET, FTIR, HRTEM and TGA. The effects of the
   nanosize on the textural properties, the shape and the morphology were
   studied. The adsorption of Q-65 molecules onto different-sized
   nanoparticles was tested in toluene-based solutions. On a normalized
   surface area basis, the number of Q-65 molecules adsorbed per nm(2) of
   the NiO surface was the highest for NiO nanoparticles of size 80 nm,
   while that for 5 nm sized NiO nanoparticles was the lowest. Excitingly,
   the adsorption capacity of other NiO sizes varied from loading
   suggesting different adsorption behavior, which exhibits the
   significance of textural properties during the adsorption of Q-65.
   Computational modeling of the interaction between the Q-65 molecule and
   the NiO nanoparticle surface was carried out to get more understanding
   of its adsorption behavior. A number of factors contributing to the
   enhanced adsorption capacity of nanoscale NiO were determined. These
   include surface reactivity, topology, morphology and textural
   properties.}},

Title = {{Effect of disulfide bonding and multimerization on proteoglycan 4's

Journal = {{CONNECTIVE TISSUE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{MAR 3}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The objectives of this study were to assess the cartilage
   boundary lubricating ability of (1) nonreduced (NR) disulfide-bonded
   proteoglycan 4 (PRG4) multimers versus PRG4 monomers and (2) NR versus
   reduced and alkylated (R/A) PRG4 monomers and to assess (3) the ability
   of NR PRG4 multimers versus monomers to adsorb to an articular cartilage
   surface. Materials and methods: PRG4 was separated into two
   preparations, PRG4 multimer enriched (PRG4Multi+) and PRG4 multimer
   deficient (PRG4Multi-), using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and
   characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel
   electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The cartilage boundary lubricating ability
   of PRG4Multi+ and PRG4Multi- was compared at a physiological
   concentration (450 mu g/mL) and assessed over a range of concentrations
   (45, 150, and 450 mu g/mL). R/A and NR PRG4Multi- were evaluated at 450
   mu g/mL. Immunohistochemistry with anti-PRG4 antibody 4D6 was performed
   to visualize the adsorption of PRG4 preparations to the surface of
   articular cartilage explants. Results: Separation into enriched
   populations of PRG4Multi+ and PRG4Multi- was achieved using SEC and was
   confirmed by SDS-PAGE. PRG4Multi+ and PRG4Multi- both functioned as
   effective friction-reducing cartilage boundary lubricants at 450 mu
   g/mL, with PRG4Multi+ being more effective than PRG4Multi-. PRG4Multi+
   lubricated in a dose-dependent manner, however, PRG4Multi- did not. R/A
   PRG4Multi- lubricated similar to NR PRG4Multi-. PRG4-containing
   solutions showed 4D6 immunoreactivity at the articular surface; the
   immunoreactive intensity of PRG4Multi+ appeared to be similar to SF,
   whereas PRG4Multi- appeared to have less intensity. Conclusions: These
   results demonstrate that the intermolecular disulfide-bonded multimeric
   structure of PRG4 is important for its ability to adsorb to a cartilage
   surface and function as a boundary lubricant. These findings contribute
   to a greater understanding of the molecular basis of cartilage boundary
   lubrication of PRG4. Elucidating the PRG4 structure-lubrication function
   relationship will further contribute to the understanding of PRG4's role
   in diarthrodial joint homeostasis and disease.}},

Abstract = {{With light rail transit (LRT) and other similar rail-based commuter
   transit systems, train and associated station platform length provides
   an added dimension of flexibility not available to buses. Train and
   platform lengths are important factors in the planning and expansion
   phases of a network. Existing cost models that determine optimal headway
   by combining passenger and operational costs provide headways that are
   small and close to a logistical minimum (2-3 min); this type of standard
   waiting cost model is not sensitive to train and platform length. In
   this paper, on-board crowding is used as a cost factor and a
   cost-of-crowding model is developed from supporting psychological
   research. Two models are proposed and optimized with respect to train
   length to determine the optimal train and platform length for a
   many-to-one peak period commuter LRT system. Data from the C-Train
   network in Calgary, Alberta is used for numerical analysis of the model.
   The model demonstrated that crowding has an effect on optimal train
   length. The model produced feasible results when applied to a real-world
   scenario.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on 3 Hz fatigue load testing of a reinforced concrete
   beam in laboratory conditions. Three-dimensional (3D) image time series
   of the beam's top surface were captured with the Microsoft
   time-of-flight Kinect 2.0 sensor. To estimate the beam deflection, the
   imagery was first segmented to extract the top surface of the beam. The
   centre line was then modeled using third-order B-splines. The deflection
   of the beam as a function of time was estimated from the modeled centre
   line and, following past practice, also at several witness plates
   attached to the side of the beam. Subsequent correlation of the peak
   displacement with the applied loading cycles permitted estimation of
   fatigue in the beam. The accuracy of the deflections was evaluated by
   comparison with the measurements obtained using a Keyence LK-G407 laser
   displacement sensors. The results indicate that the deflections can be
   recovered with sub-millimetre accuracy using the centreline profile
   modelling method.}},

Abstract = {{A urine evaporation system (UES) was optimized and evaluated in a
   laboratory by adding 5 L of urine at the same time each day for 65 days.
   The UES consisted of a wooden box that is open at the front only with
   tracks for 22 vertically stacked cafeteria-type trays and a fan and
   chimney at the back. Urine flowed from tray to tray via gravity exiting
   each tray via a weir along the long side of the tray. A distinctive
   physical and chemical zonation in the solid urine product was observed
   from the upper to lower trays due to leaching of precipitated minerals
   in the upper trays and mineral accumulation in the lower trays. The
   redox conditions became increasingly oxidizing from the top to bottom
   trays due to contact with the atmosphere thus favouring more stable
   mineralized forms of nitrogen (ammonium and nitrate) and sulphur
   (sulphate) and disfavouring the less stable and volatile ammonia,
   nitrogen gas and hydrogen sulphide. The quality of the fertilizer
   product is higher in the upper trays with higher levels of nitrogen,
   phosphorus and potassium, whereas the lower trays have higher levels of
   sodium chloride. Nitrogen losses due to ammonia volatilization were
   approximately 35\%.}},

Title = {{A semi-analytical method for forecasting wells completed in low
   permeability, undersaturated CBM reservoirs}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},
Pages = {{19-27}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Exploration and development of coalbed methane (CBM) reservoirs is
   ongoing in the Asia Pacific region, with low permeability,
   undersaturated coals being the target in some areas. Horizontal wells
   are typically required to produce low permeability CBM reservoirs at
   commercial rates, and may experience a period of single-phase (water)
   transient flow, followed by a transition to two-phase (water + gas)
   transient flow. Wells exhibiting this behavior are particularly
   difficult to model analytically, yet simple analytical and
   semi-analytical tools are desirable for making quick, but reasonably
   accurate forecasts. The purpose of this work is to therefore provide a
   new forecasting methodology for low permeability, undersaturated CBM
   wells.
   The new method for forecasting CBM wells introduced in this work is
   based on the concept of a dynamic drainage area (DDA), recently adapted
   to forecast tight black oil and gas condensate wells exhibiting
   two-phase flow. A critical advancement provided in the current work is
   modeling the transition from single-phase flow of water to two-phase
   flow of gas and water during the transient linear flow period, which was
   not attempted for the black oil/gas condensate cases. Above desorption
   pressure, material balance, performed on the dynamic drainage area to
   determine average pressure in the distance of investigation, is combined
   with the linear flow productivity index equation to forecast water
   production at each time step. For two-phase flow below desorption
   pressure, the two-phase version of the linear productivity equation and
   material balance equations for water and gas are solved iteratively for
   pressure, saturation and fluid production rate within the DDA. The gas
   material balance equation accounts for desorption effects. In order to
   calculate the DDA at each time step, the linear flow distance of
   investigation equation is used. Importantly, using the DDA method,
   variable operating conditions (flowing pressures) may be accounted for,
   which is critical for CBM wells during early stages of production.
   The new semi-analytical DDA model is used to history-match production
   data from an actual horizontal well completed in a low permeability,
   undersaturated, western Canadian CBM reservoir. Further, the match is
   compared to that obtained from rigorous numerical simulation. The
   history-match of the field data is reasonable with the new model and
   comparable to numerical simulation. The new model is however easier to
   setup and less data-intensive than numerical simulation, providing a
   practical alternative to CBM reservoir engineers who are responsible for
   generating a large number of forecasts. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{A modified approach for modeling two-phase flowback from multi-fractured
   horizontal shale gas wells}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},
Pages = {{127-147}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Historically, high-frequency fluid production and flowing pressures
   (hourly or greater) have been gathered on nearly every multi-fractured
   horizontal well (MFHW), although this data has rarely been used by
   industry in a quantitative manner to characterize hydraulic fracture or
   reservoir parameters. Recently several authors have recognized the
   potential to extract key properties from this early-time data.
   This work will expand on the analytical flowback analysis model
   presented by Clarkson and Williams Kovacs (2013a) and modified by
   Williams-Kovacs and Clarkson (2013a). These works presented a data
   driven pseudo-analytical modeling approach for quantitatively analyzing
   two-phase flowback to estimate key frac properties including fracture
   conductivity and half-length. In these early attempts to model flowback
   from shale gas wells, multi-phase depletion from the fracture network
   was assumed to be the primary flow-regime. More recently, three
   flow-regimes have been observed in flowback data depending on data
   frequency: 1) transient flow of frac fluid within the fracture network
   prior to breakthrough of formation fluids (rarely seen in shale gas); 2)
   Single-phase depletion of water within the fracture network (also rarely
   seen); and 3) coupled formation and fracture flow following breakthrough
   of formation fluid. In this work, flow-regimes 1-3 are modeled
   rigorously. Flow-regime 3 is the focus of this study and will be modeled
   using a coupling of transient linear flow of gas from the matrix to the
   fractures with multi-phase depletion within the fracture network
   (conceptually more realistic than previous attempts). Further, dynamic
   fracture porosity and permeability are incorporated to better represent
   the physics of the problem and a modified material balance equation
   (MBE) is developed to account for additional drive mechanisms (fracture
   closure in addition to desorption and gas expansion). Finally a modified
   pseudo-pressure and pseudo-time are applied to before-breakthrough (BBT)
   single-phase rate transient analysis (RTA) and after-breakthrough (ABT)
   multi-phase RTA (conducted after analytical simulation using pressure
   and saturation dependent outputs from simulation) to improve both
   parameter estimates (BBT) and flow-regime confirmation (ABT). The new
   model is compared to the previous model using a field case study. (C)

Abstract = {{The gold standard treatment for full thickness injuries of the skin is
   autologous split-thickness skin grafting. This involves harvesting the
   epidermis and superficial dermis from healthy skin and transplanting it
   onto the prepared wound bed. The donor site regenerates spontaneously,
   but the appendages and cellular components from the dermal layer are
   excluded from the graft. As a result, the new tissue is inferior; the
   healed graft site is dry/itchy, has decreased elasticity, increased
   fragility, and altered sensory function. Because this dermal layer is
   composed of collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins, the aim
   was to characterize the changes in the dermal collagen after split
   thickness grafting that could contribute to a deficit in functionality.
   This will serve as a baseline for future studies designed to improve
   skin function using pharmacological or cell-based therapies for skin
   repair. A xenograft model whereby human split-thickness grafts were
   implanted into full-thickness defects on immunocompromised (athymic
   Nu/Nu) mice was used. The grafts were harvested 4 and 8 weeks later. The
   collagen microstructure was assessed with second harmonic generation
   with dual-photon microscopy and light polarization analysis. Collagen
   fiber stiffness and engagement stretch were estimated by fitting the
   results of biaxial mechanical tensile tests to a histo-mechanical
   constitutive model. The stiffness of the collagen fibril-proteoglycan
   complex increased from 682 +/- 226 kPa/sr to 1016 +/- 324 kPa/sr between
   4 and 8 weeks postgrafting. At the microstructural level there were
   significant decreases in both thickness of collagen fibers (3.60 +/-
   0.34 lm vs. 2.10 +/- 0.27 lm) and waviness ratio (2.04 +/- 0.17 vs.
   1.436 +/-.08) of the collagen fibers postgrafting. The decrease of the
   macroscopic engagement stretch from 1.19 +/- 0.11 to 1.09 +/- 0.08 over
   time postgrafting mirrored the decrease in waviness measured at the
   microscopic level. This suggested that the integrity of the collagen
   fibers was compromised and contributed to the functional deficit of the
   skin postgrafting.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The process of melting in partially saturated porous media is modeled
   for flow displacements prone to hydrodynamic instabilities due to
   adverse mobility ratios. The effects of the development of instabilities
   on the melting process are investigated through numerical simulations as
   well as analytical solution to unravel the physics of the flow. The
   effects of melting parameters, namely, the melting potential of the
   fluid, the rate of heat transfer to the frozen phase, and the saturation
   of the frozen material along with the parameters defining the viscous
   forces, i.e., the thermal and solutal log mobility ratios are examined.
   Results are presented for different scenarios and the enhancement or
   attenuation of instabilities are discussed based on the dominant
   physical mechanisms. Beside an extensive qualitative analysis, the
   performance of different displacement scenarios is compared with respect
   to the melt production and the extent of contribution of instability to
   the enhancement of melting. It is shown that the hydrodynamic
   instabilities tend in general to enhance melting but the rate of
   enhancement depends on the interplay between the instabilities and
   melting at the thermal front. A larger melting potential and a smaller
   saturation of the frozen material tend to increase the contribution of
   instability to melting. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   process}},
Journal = {{WASTE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Biomass fast pyrolysis followed by hydrodeoxygenation upgrading is the
   most popular way to produce upgraded bio-oil from biomass. This process
   requires large quantities of expensive hydrogen and operates under high
   pressure condition (70-140 atm). Therefore, a novel methanolysis (i.e.,
   biomass pyrolysis under methane environment) process is developed in
   this study, which is effective in upgraded bio-oil formation at
   atmospheric pressure and at about 400-600 degrees C. Instead of using
   pure methane, simulated biogas (60\% CH4 + 40\% CO2) was used to test
   the feasibility of this novel methanolysis process for the conversion of
   different solid wastes. The bio-oil obtained from canola straw is
   slightly less than that from sawdust in term of quantity, but the oil
   quality from canola straw is better in terms of lower acidity, lower
   Bromine Number, higher H/C atomic ratio and lower O/C atomic ratio. The
   municipal solid waste and newspaper can also obtain relatively high oil
   yields, but the oil qualities of them are both lower than those from
   sawdust and canola straw. Compared with catalysts of 5\%Zn/ZSM-5 and
   1\%Ag/ZSM-5, the 5\% Zn-1\%Ag/ZSM-5 catalyst performed much better in
   terms of upgraded bio-oil yield as well as oil quality. During the
   methanolysis process, the metal silver may be used to reduce the total
   acid number of the oil while the metal zinc might act to decrease the
   bromine number of the oil. The highly dispersed Zn and Ag species on/in
   the catalyst benefit the achievement of better upgrading performance and
   make it be a very promising catalyst for bio-oil upgrading by biogas.

Abstract = {{The initial state of hydrocarbon mixtures in petroleum reservoirs is the
   result of equilibrium among several forces, the most important of which
   are the chemical forces arising from chemical potential gradients of the
   molecular species in the petroleum accumulation, the gravitational force
   arising from the gravitational acceleration, and the thermal diffusion
   forces arising from temperature gradients. The equilibrium among these
   forces determines the state of pressure and a compositional gradient and
   the creation of a gas oil contact (GOC) in a stationary reservoir along
   with the changes in other physical properties. Accurate modeling of
   these changes in the development of a proper stationary model for the
   reservoir simulation initialization leads to more realistic predictions
   of the future behavior of petroleum reservoirs. This is important
   especially when phase behavior is important in designing, modeling, and
   predicting the performance of the processes used to maximize the oil
   recovery, such as in dealing with a gas condensate reservoir or when
   miscible displacement is to be done in the enhanced oil recovery (EOR)
   stage of the reservoir life. In this study, we consider the equilibrium
   among chemical, gravitational and thermal diffusion forces to predict
   the changes in reservoir fluid composition and pressure and also to
   predict the location of a possible GOC in a reservoir. Additionally, we
   develop a simple model to predict the change of the plus-fraction
   molecular weight (MW) in a non isothermal reservoir using continuous
   thermodynamics and the theory of irreversible processes. We propose a
   method not only to tune the equation of state (EOS) versus the measured
   PVT lab data for one fluid sample but also to accurately model the
   depths of the GOC and other fluid samples and their PVT lab data in
   order to determine which sample is representative of the reservoir fluid
   and also to develop an EOS model that can work for every fluid in the
   reservoir, not just a single point. In two case studies, we validate our
   calculation procedure for the general compositional gradient, GOC
   detection, and the plus-fraction MW change in the reservoir against two
   data sets from the literature. The computational results show that the
   model developed works satisfactorily to predict the fluid changes in
   these two reservoirs. Subsequently, we also report the results of a
   series of sensitivity analysis tests to show the factors affecting the
   compositional gradient calculations and present examples of abnormal
   fluid distributions in a hydrocarbon fluid column where the fluid
   becomes denser toward the top of the column or the changes in fluid
   properties are highly nonlinear with respect to depth in the reservoir.}},

Abstract = {{The primary objective of this study is to show the importance of the
   adsorption method used in obtaining the nanoparticle dosage for
   inhibiting/remediating asphaltene-related problems. In this work, two
   methods for determining the adsorption isotherms for different
   asphaltenes onto three different types of nanoparticles were evaluated.
   The adsorption equilibrium of n-C-7 asphaltenes was determined using
   batch-mode adsorption experiments that were performed in two different
   ways: (i) by exposing a certain mass of nanoparticles in a fixed volume
   of liquid with a varying initial concentration of asphaltenes and (ii)
   by exposing a given amount of asphaltenes in a fixed volume of liquid
   while varying the dosage of nanoparticles. The results obtained using
   these two methods were sufficient to determine the type I and III
   adsorption isotherms, respectively. These differences in behavior in
   adsorption isotherms can be due complexity of the n-C-7 asphaltenes,
   which are self-associative molecules that impact directly the
   interaction between the adsorbate (i-mers depending on their
   concentration) and adsorbent. These results were proven through the
   aggregate size distribution of asphaltenes as estimated by dynamic light
   scattering (DLS) measurements. The experimental data was well described
   with the solid liquid equilibrium (SLE) model. The adsorption isotherms
   obtained using the second method deviated significantly from those
   typically reported in the literature. However, this method is a useful
   tool for determining the required amount of nanoparticles based on the
   interactions of adsorbate-adsorbate and adsorbate-nanoadsorbent. Indeed,
   this method is of practical significance because the amount of
   asphaltenes at reservoir conditions can be considered constant when
   treatments are performed.}},

Abstract = {{Air has the characteristics of low-temperature oxidation (LTO) as well
   as improving drainage energy. Therefore, it can be co-injected with
   steam to enhance an oil recovery factor. This paper studies combined
   steam air flooding for heavy oil recovery. Four experiments, including
   one steam flooding experiment and three combined steam-air flooding
   experiments, are studied. The volume ratios of air and steam in these
   three combined flooding experiments are 1:2, 1:1, and 2:1, respectively.
   The experimental results show that combined steam air flooding can
   enhance the oil recovery factor when the volume ratio of air and steam
   is in a certain range. Furthermore, numerical simulation results show
   that its temperature and oil recovery tendency are similar to those from
   the experiments. In the numerical simulation study, an optimal volume
   ratio of air and steam is 1.5:2. Finally, a field test of combined steam
   air flooding in the Qi-40 block of the Liaohe oil field is studied to
   validate the experimental and numerical results. Results show that air
   can be an effective additive that enhances heavy oil recovery in a steam
   flooding process.}},

   above the pinch-off point (i.e., class-AB bias conditions). The proposed
   theory starts with deriving intrinsic drain current and voltage
   waveforms for continuous class-F harmonic tuned PA biased above
   pinch-off and then finding the resulting design space. The new
   formations resulted in shifted fundamental impedance space along with
   expanded second harmonic impedance space as the conduction angle, a, is
   swept between 180 and 360 degrees. Moreover, under class-F harmonic
   tuned termination, it is found that the drive power required at the
   input of the device is also dependent on bias conditions. For
   experimental validation, the proposed approach is adopted to implement a
   broadband PA using a 10 W gallium-nitride (GaN) transistor. Under
   class-AB bias conditions, the implemented PA shows more than 70\% power
   added efficiency, 40 dBm output power, and 15 dB gain at frequencies
   from 550 to 950 MHz.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, Cloisite 20A, an organically modified Montmorillonite
   (Mnt), has been incorporated into Fluoroelastomer (FKM) through melt
   intercalation technique. Since the nanocomposite preparation method and
   conditions, and consequently, the resulting morphology play a critical
   role in the final properties, the effect of different process conditions
   such as time, temperature, and shear rate on the vulcanization, thermal
   and mechanical properties have been investigated. The morphology of
   nanocomposites, prepared at different melt-mixing conditions, was
   studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD). Rheological, thermal and
   mechanical behaviors were investigated by moving die rheometer (MDR),
   thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), and tensile strength test
   respectively. Also, the crosslinking density has been measured for the
   nanocomposites. The best mechanical performance of clay/FKM
   nanocomposites was attained by optimization of the melt-mixing
   conditions. We achieved the following enhancements for FKM by clay
   incorporation: enhancement of tensile strength up to 70 \%; elongation
   up to 94 \%; and modulus up to 405 \%. Process temperature was found to
   have a critical role in the final properties of the nanocomposites,
   while mixing residual time and shear rate had a moderate effect. The
   most desirable properties and curing behaviors, including highest
   maximum torques, cure rates, crosslinking densities, fast crosslinking
   kinetics, high intercalation and best improved tensile strengths,
   resulted with specific combination of melt-mixing parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) is a key component of
   operating electricity markets. By increasing the share of renewable
   energies on the generation side, and emergence and growth of new
   stochastic loads on the demand side, stochastic SCUC has become more
   important for secure-optimal operation of the market. Scenario-based
   techniques have been suggested widely for stochastic SCUC in the
   literature. However, they are usually very time-consuming. This problem
   is escalated in large-scale power systems with high penetration of
   stochastic generation and loads. To mitigate the computational burden of
   SCUC problem, this paper develops an algorithm, based on point
   estimation method and Bender's decomposition technique. The proposed
   approach breaks the probabilistic problem into a few deterministic
   points with much lower computation burden yet with minimal loss of
   accuracy. The proposed approach is implemented on a six-bus system as
   the first numerical study, and on a modified IEEE 118-bus system with 94
   probabilistic variables as the second case study. The efficacy of
   proposed algorithm is confirmed, especially in the last test case with
   notable reduction in computational burden without considerable loss of
   precision. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   preference respondents: (i) auto drivers, who were given the choice
   between driving alone and carpooling as drivers; and (ii) transit
   riders, who were given the choice between public transport and
   carpooling as passengers. A binomial logit model and two ordinal logit
   models (one for ride offerors and one for ride seekers) were calibrated
   to examine the impacts of various examined socio-economic,
   psychological, and travel characteristic variables on the propensity to
   participate in the hypothetical carpooling program. The results of the
   models clearly demonstrated that many factors have significant impacts
   on FacePorter demand: occupation, income, marital status, working
   schedule flexibility, trip characteristics (i.e., distance, travel time,
   and number of required transfers when riding transit), weather

Abstract = {{The use of Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology in reporting the real-time
   location of resources (workers and equipment) is shown to be effective
   in improving the current safety monitoring practices. Since many site
   accidents occur when workers are struck by moving equipment or enter
   hazard-prone areas, it is important to evaluate the accuracy of the UWB
   RTLS in estimating the location of dynamic resources on construction
   sites. In this paper, the effects of variables, such as ``speed{''} and
   ``heading{''}, on the accuracy of the estimated location of dynamic tags
   are investigated. It is shown that the accuracy is inversely
   proportionate to the speed of the tag, the number of tags being tracked
   and the complexity of the path on which the tag is moving. A novel
   approach to defining ``danger zones{''} on construction sites is also
   proposed through which the feasibility of using static tags to define
   the boundaries of forbidden areas on site is validated. The findings of
   this study indicate the applicability of UWB in locating dynamic

Volume = {{113}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated the use of C-band compact polarimetric synthetic
   aperture radar for estimation of ocean surface wind speeds. Using 1399
   buoy observations collocated with Radarsat-2 scenes, compact
   polarimetric data was simulated for two of the Radarsat Constellation's
   planned wide swath imaging modes. Provided the wind direction is known
   or can be estimated, our results demonstrate that wind speed can be
   estimated from the right-vertical polarization channel of the compact
   polarimetry using a combination of the CMOD5 geophysical model function
   and a linear model. If wind speed estimation without wind direction
   input is desired, the randomly-polarized component of the backscattered
   power can be used in a similar fashion to that of the linear
   cross-polarizations, but is less affected by increases in the noise
   effective sigma-zero of the data. A model is proposed for the
   randomly-polarized power as a function of incidence angle and wind
   speed, independent of wind direction. The results suggest that compact
   polarimetry is a strong alternative to linearly polarized synthetic
   aperture radar data for wind speed estimation applications, particularly
   for wide swath imaging modes with a high noise floor. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel weighted memory polynomial (WMP)-based model is
   proposed for wireless transmitters and radio-frequency power amplifiers'
   (PAs) behavioral modeling and predistortion. The new model introduces an
   instantaneous-power-dependent weight function on the static and dynamic
   terms of the conventional memory polynomial (MP) model. Experimental
   validation in both modeling and predistortion contexts was performed on
   a PA prototype driven by a 20-MHz Long Term Evolution signal. The
   proposed model was assessed against the standard MP model. The
   experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
   polynomial in behavioral modeling applications as it results in up to
   50\% (3-dB) improvement in the normalized mean square error for the same
   number of coefficients. The model robustness was then validated by using
   a second test signal applied to two Doherty PAs using different
   transistor technologies. Furthermore, when applied for digital
   predistortion, the proposed WMP function achieves the same performance
   as the state-of-art MP while requiring approximately 50\% less
   coefficients.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoparticles can provide significant improvements in the diagnosis and
   treatment of cancer. How nanoparticle size, shape, and surface chemistry
   can affect their accumulation, retention, and penetration in tumors
   remains heavily investigated, because such findings provide guiding
   principles for engineering optimal nano-systems for tumor targeting.
   Currently, the experimental focus has been on particle design and not
   the biological system. Here, we varied tumor volume to determine whether
   cancer pathophysiology can influence tumor accumulation and penetration
   of different sized nanoparticles. Monte Carlo simulations were also used
   to model the process of nanoparticle accumulation. We discovered that
   changes in pathophysiology associated with tumor volume can selectively
   change tumor uptake of nanoparticles of varying size. We further
   determine that nanoparticle retention within tumors depends on the
   frequency of interaction of particles with the perivascular
   extracellular matrix for smaller nanoparticles, whereas transport of
   larger nanomaterials is dominated by Brownian motion. These results
   reveal that nanoparticles can potentially be personalized according to a
   patient's disease state to achieve optimal diagnostic and therapeutic
   outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Stemming from statistical thermodynamics, Perturbed-Chain Statistical
   Associating Fluid Theory (PCSAFT) shows promising results for predicting
   phase equilibrium and density for light and heavy oil. In this work, the
   simplified version of PC-SAFT was applied to model the density and
   solubility of bitumen/ solvent systems and was integrated with the
   Expanded Fluid Viscosity Theory to predict and match the viscosity of
   such systems. A simple new eight-pseudo-component characterization
   method was developed for different Alberta Bitumens using distillation
   and molar mass data. The proposed characterization method for the
   simplified PC-SAFT was applied to match the density and solubility data
   of Athabasca Bitumen with gas alkanes and CO2 and was used to predict
   the density of Athabasca Bitumen and Peace River Bitumen with liquid
   solvents (alkanes and aromatics), without further adjustment. Finally,
   the viscosity of the bitumen and solvent mixtures was predicted and
   matched using PC-SAFT coupled with the Expanded Fluid Viscosity Model.
   The overall average absolute relative deviations were within 2.3\% for
   the density of the 13 bitumen/solvent systems, within 6.6\% for the
   solubility of three systems, and 14.6\% for the viscosity of eight
   systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The cohesive-frictional nature of cementitious geomaterials raises great
   interest in the discrete element method (DEM) simulation of their
   mechanical behavior, where a proper bond failure criterion is usually
   required. In this paper, the failure of bond material between two
   spheres was investigated numerically using DEM that can easily reproduce
   the failure process of brittle material. In the DEM simulations, a
   bonded-grain system (composed of two particles and bond material in
   between) was discretized as a cylindrical assembly of very fine
   particles connecting two large end spheres. Then, the bonded-grain
   system was subjected to compression/tension, shear, rolling and torsion
   loadings and their combinations until overall failure (peak state) was
   reached. Bonded-grain systems with various sizes were employed to
   investigate bond geometry effects. The numerical results show that the
   compression strength is highly affected by bond geometry, with the
   tensile strength being dependent to a lesser degree. The shear, rolling
   and torsion strengths are all normal force dependent; i.e., with an
   increase in the normal force, these strengths first increase at a
   declining rate and then start to decrease upon the normal force
   exceeding a critical value. The combined actions of shear force, rolling
   moment and torque lead to a spherical failure envelope in a normalized
   loading space. The fitted bond geometry factors and bond failure
   envelopes obtained numerically in this three-dimensional study are
   qualitatively consistent with those in previous two-dimensional
   experiments. The obtained bond failure criterion can be incorporated
   into a future bond contact model. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new method consisting of two stages for automatic
   detection and segmentation of coronary arteries in X-ray angiograms. In
   the first stage, multiscale Gabor filters are used to detect vessel
   structures in the angiograms. The results of multiscale Gabor filtering
   are compared with those obtained by applying multiscale methods based on
   the top-hat operator, Hessian matrix, and Gaussian matched filters. The
   performance of the vessel-detection methods is evaluated through the
   area (A(z)) under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. In
   the second stage, coronary arteries are segmented by binarizing the
   magnitude response of Gabor filters using a new thresholding method
   based on multi objective optimization, which is compared with seven
   thresholding methods. Measures of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy,
   and positive predictive value are used to analyze the segmentation
   methods, by comparing the results to the ground-truth markings of the
   vessels drawn by a specialist. Finally, the proposed method is compared
   with seven state-of-the-art vessel segmentation methods. The result of
   vessel detection using multiscale Gabor filters demonstrated high
   accuracy with A(z) = 0.961 with a training set of 40 angiograms and A(z)
   = 0.952 with an independent test set of 40 angiograms. The results of
   vessel segmentation with the multiobjective thresholding method provided
   an average accuracy of 0.881 with the test set of angiograms. (C) 2015

   performed in series, respectively, via a differential approach to
   analysis of the tissue surrounding the candidates and via quantification
   of nonstationarity and spatial dependence of pixel values within
   circular and annular regions of interest. A unified 3D free-response
   receiver operating characteristic framework is applied for global
   analysis of the two binary categorization problems in series. The system
   was tested on a total of 2105 full-field digital and screen-film
   mammograms from three different datasets, including abnormal mammograms
   with 560 malignant tumors and 639 benign lesions, masses, or
   architectural distortion, and 1010 normal mammograms. For sensitivity of
   detection of malignant tumors in the range of 0.70-0.81, the range of
   falsely detected malignant tumors was 0.82-3.47 per image, with a series
   of two stages of classification, including stepwise logistic regression
   for selection of features, Fisher linear discriminant analysis, and
   two-fold cross-validation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the following analysis, we present a rigorous solution for the
   problem of a circular elastic inclusion surrounded by an infinite
   elastic matrix in finite plane elastostatics. The inclusion and matrix
   are separated by a circumferentially inhomogeneous imperfect interface
   characterized by the linear spring-type imperfect interface model where
   the interface is such that the same degree of imperfection is realized
   in both the normal and tangential directions. Through the use of
   analytic continuation, a set of first-order coupled ordinary
   differential equations with variable coefficients are developed for two
   analytic potential functions. The unknown coefficients of the potential
   functions are determined from their analyticity requirements and some
   additional problem-specific constraints. An example is then presented
   for a specific class of interface where the inclusion mean stress is
   contrasted between the homogeneous interface and inhomogeneous interface
   models. It is shown that, for circumstances where a homogeneously
   imperfect interface may not be warranted, the inhomogeneous model has a
   pronounced effect on the mean stress within the inclusion.}},

Abstract = {{The flux of a certain extensive physical quantity across a surface is
   often represented by the integral over the surface of the component of a
   pseudo-vector normal to the surface. A pseudo-vector is in fact a
   possible representation of a second-order differential form, i.e. a
   skew-symmetric second-order covariant tensor, which follows the regular
   transformation laws of tensors. However, because of the skew-symmetry of
   differential forms, the associated pseudo-vector follows a
   transformation law that is different from that of proper vectors, and is
   named after the Italian mathematical physicist Gabrio Piola (1794-1850).
   In this work, we employ the methods of Differential Geometry and the
   representation in terms of differential forms to demonstrate how the
   flux of an extensive quantity transforms from the spatial to the
   material point of view. After an introduction to the theory of
   differential forms, their transformation laws, and their role in
   integration theory, we apply them to the case of first-order transport
   laws such as Darcy's law and Ohm's law.}},

Abstract = {{The study develops a methodology for the aero-structural design
   including consideration of the starting of a small wind turbine blade.
   To design a fast-starting blade, starting time was combined with output
   power in an objective function and the blade allowable stress was
   considered as a constraint. The output power and the starting time were
   calculated by the blade-element momentum theory and the simple beam
   theory was employed to compute the stress and deflection along the
   blade. A genetic algorithm was employed to solve the constrained
   objective function, finding an optimal blade for which the starting time
   was small and output power was high while the stress limitation was also
   met. Considering the hollow cross-sectional model for the structural
   analysis, the design variables consist of the chord, twist and the shell
   thickness along the blade. Results showed that a hollow blade expedites
   the starting at low speeds by decreasing the blade inertia while the
   resultant stress along the blade does not exceed the allowable stress.
   By increasing the contribution of the starting time in the objective
   function, both the external and internal geometry of the blade help the
   starting and also provide more powerful hollow blades compared to the
   solid ones. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   shielding of their polymeric nanocomposites}},
Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{358-372}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Different catalysts including Co, Fe, and Ni were used to synthesize
   nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) by chemical vapor deposition
   technique. Synthesized N-CNTs were melt mixed with a polyvinylidene
   fluoride (PVDF) matrix using a small scale mixer at different
   concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 3.5 wt\%, and then compression
   molded. The characterization techniques revealed significant differences
   in the synthesis yield and the morphological and electrical properties
   of both N-CNTs and nanocomposites depending on the catalyst type.
   Whereas Co and Fe resulted in yields comparable to industrial
   multiwalled CNTs, Ni was much less effective. The N-CNT aspect ratio was
   the highest for Co catalyst, followed by Ni and Fe, whereas nitrogen
   content was the highest for Ni. Raman spectroscopy revealed lowest
   defect number and highest N-CNT crystallinity for Fe catalyst.
   Characterization of N-CNT/PVDF nanocomposites showed better dispersion
   for N-CNTs based on Co and Fe as compared to Ni, and the following order
   of electrical conductivity and electromagnetic interference shielding
   (from high to low): Co > Fe > Ni. The superior electrical properties of
   (N-CNT)(Co) nanocomposites were ascribed to a combination of high
   synthesis yield, high aspect ratio, low nitrogen content and high
   crystallinity of NCNTs combined with a good state of N-CNT dispersion.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a multiscale model to simulate coalbed methane
   (CBM) production from reservoirs along with the inclusion of secondary
   biogenic gas generated by the continued anaerobic breakdown of coal. A
   two-step gas transport model is derived for this purpose, based on the
   assumption that coal porosity can be classified into two scales,
   macropores and micropores. The model assumes laminar gas flow in
   macropores and diffusive flow in micropores, driven by desorption.
   Surface diffusion of gas due to the Klinkenberg effect occurring at low
   permeability and pressure conditions is also considered. The transport
   model built for gas flow simulation in a 1D radial reservoir is
   non-dimensionalized and solved using the Levenberg-Marquardt method. The
   Morris OAT (one-at-a-time) method for global sensitivity analysis is
   used to identify important gas transport/storage parameters to perform
   model refinement for history matching of production data from the gas
   producing phase of Manville wells found in Alberta. The validated
   transport model is then combined with a suitably modified enzymatic
   kinetic model for coal bioconversion that was originally developed by us
   for lab-scale experiments. Finally, parametric investigations revealed
   that an order of magnitude increase in the methanogenesis rate can
   significantly improve biogenic gas recovery, and the next most
   significant parameter is the solubilization rate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this study, the effects of K2CO3 addition to Genesse sub-bituminous
   coal, before and after ash reduction, on conversion and gasification
   rate were investigated for CO2 gasification at 700-800 degrees C. For
   the uncatalyzed samples, no significant changes in gasification rate and
   char conversion were observed for the low-ash product (12 wt\% ash)
   compared to the raw coal (33 wt\% ash). However, with the addition of 10
   wt potassium catalyst, the low-ash product exhibited a higher
   gasification rate than the raw coal. An increase of the catalyst loading
   up to 50 wt\% resulted in a decline of the gasification rate for both
   coal samples. The activation energy increased with conversion and at
   higher K2CO3 loadings. Kinetic modeling showed that the extended-random
   pore model fits the experimental data well for both coal samples and
   supported the speculation that excess catalyst blocks pores, resulting a
   reduction in gasification rate. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A generalised two-box cascaded Hammerstein-like (GTBC-H) digital
   predistorter is proposed for linearising wide-band RF power amplifiers
   (PAs). The GTBC-H predistorter is composed of a static nonlinearity
   block for countervailing the strong static nonlinearities and a dynamic
   nonlinearity block for compensating the memory effects of RF PAs. The
   proposed predistorter adds extended cross-terms of the leading terms and
   some lagging envelope terms in the dynamic nonlinearity block to
   compensate the memory effects of wide-band RF PAs more effectively. A
   460 MHz and a 1.94 GHz Doherty RF PA are utilised to validate the
   performance of the proposed predistorter when a three-carrier wide-band
   CDMA and a single-carrier long-term evaluation signal are applied
   separately. The validation results illustrate that the proposed GTBC-H
   predistorter can further suppress the residual out-of-band emission over
   the augmented Hammerstein, the enhanced Hammerstein and the

Abstract = {{Multi-response surface (MRS) optimization in quality design often
   involves some problems such as correlation among multiple responses,

   Bayesian approach is proposed to address the aforementioned
   multi-response optimization problems. The proposed approach not only
   measures the reliability of an acceptable optimization result, but also
   incorporates expected loss (i.e., bias and robustness) into a uniform
   framework of Bayesian modeling and optimization. The advantages of this
   approach are illustrated by one example. The results show that the
   proposed approach can give more reasonable solutions than the existing
   approaches when both quality loss and the reliability of optimization

Volume = {{106}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Co-metabolic removal of a synthetic solvent, trichloroethylene (TCE) was
   conducted. Phenol was used as the primary substrate, and aerobic
   granules as the biocatalyst. An airtight reactor was designed and
   constructed with glass, and the configuration was verified of its
   applicability with volatile solvent. Phenol and TCE were fed into the
   reactors alternately, and both were efficiently removed during 6 weeks
   of operation. Compared with the control reactor receiving no TCE,
   biomass in the TCE-fed reactors had lower phenol-dependent specific
   oxygen utilization rate, but higher concentration, bigger size, and
   better settling ability. The morphology of the biomass in TCE and
   control reactors exhibited distinct characteristics. Granules in the TCE
   reactors slightly broke up early in the operation, but generally
   retained their shape and structure throughout. The biomass in the
   control reactor, however, lost its granular structure and totally
   disintegrated into flocs. Therefore, TCE co-metabolism likely improved
   the structural integrity of aerobic granular sludge, and co-metabolic
   degradation of TCE by phenol-grown aerobic granules showed long term
   stability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Project II is the third case study to be reported on land tenure
   administration in state-subsidised housing projects the Western Cape
   which indicate that registration is effective in administering

   produced the benefits envisaged. In a number of South African
   state-subsidised housing projects a number of houses have changed hands
   off-register, which creates costly long-term land tenure administration
   problems. The Project II study examined the strategies that people use
   to defend their tenure and to effect transactions in land. While there
   are major problem cases in South Africa, the Project II study, building
   on two similar case studies, indicates that individual tenure,
   registered in ownership, can work in pro-poor housing programmes if the
   right conditions exist. Although there was evidence of off-register
   transactions in all three case studies, the situation can be improved by
   hands on management to create and maintain the enabling conditions for
   registration to be effective rather than major changes in law, policy
   and land administration practice. Distinctive, new knowledge, emerging

Title = {{Measurement and Modeling of Solubility and Saturated-Liquid Density and

Journal = {{SPE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{180-189}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In the steam-based recovery processes, the coinjected gas can dissolve
   and diffuse into bitumen or heavy oil for viscosity reduction. The
   equilibrium concentration and solubility of methane are governed by the
   complex interaction with the bitumen. Thus, it is necessary to know the
   quantitative effects of gas dissolution on bitumen viscosity, density,
   and phase behavior at elevated temperatures in which steam-based
   processes are applied.
   Thus, this study aims at providing necessary experimental data for
   methane/Athabasca bitumen over a wide range of temperatures and
   pressures (up to 190 degrees C and 10 MPa); that is, conditions that
   approach the temperatures at in-situ steam processes. Our previously
   designed phase-behavior experimental apparatus was used to measure the
   solubility of methane in Athabasca bitumen and its corresponding
   saturated-phase properties. Then, the measured solubility and density
   data were modeled with the Peng-Robinson equation of state (EOS)
   (Robinson and Peng 1978).
   The results indicate that the effect of temperature on the solubility
   profile of the methane/Athabasca-bitumen mixture is negligible at high
   temperatures and there is a distinct difference in the solubility data
   at 50 degrees C compared with other isotherms (100, 150, and 190 degrees
   C). Therefore, a reduction in viscosity at higher temperatures is much
   lower compared with a similar reduction at low temperature (50 degrees
   C). There is a linear relationship between the methane-saturated
   viscosity and pressure for all temperatures in a semilog plot. The EOS
   modeling results also show that temperature-dependent binary-interaction
   parameters and volume-translation values should be considered to match
   density and solubility data.}},

Abstract = {{Landslides often cause economic losses, property damage, and loss of
   lives. Monitoring landslides using high spatial and temporal resolution
   imagery and the ability to quickly identify landslide regions are the
   basis for emergency disaster management. This study presents a
   comprehensive system that uses unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and
   Semi-Global dense Matching (SGM) techniques to identify and extract
   landslide scarp data. The selected study area is located along a major
   highway in a mountainous region in Jordan, and contains creeping
   landslides induced by heavy rainfall. Field observations across the
   slope body and a deformation analysis along the highway and existing
   gabions indicate that the slope is active and that scarp features across
   the slope will continue to open and develop new tension crack features,
   leading to the downward movement of rocks. The identification of
   landslide scarps in this study was performed via a dense 3D point cloud
   of topographic information generated from high-resolution images
   captured using a low-cost UAV and a target-based camera calibration
   procedure for a low-cost large-field-of-view camera. An automated
   approach was used to accurately detect and extract the landslide head
   scarps based on geomorphological factors: the ratio of normalized
   Eigenvalues (i.e., 1/2 3) derived using principal component analysis,
   topographic surface roughness index values, and local-neighborhood slope
   measurements from the 3D image-based point cloud. Validation of the
   results was performed using root mean square error analysis and a
   confusion (error) matrix between manually digitized landslide scarps and
   the automated approaches. The experimental results using the fully
   automated 3D point-based analysis algorithms show that these approaches
   can effectively distinguish landslide scarps. The proposed algorithms
   can accurately identify and extract landslide scarps with
   centimeter-scale accuracy. In addition, the combination of UAV-based
   imagery, 3D scene reconstruction, and landslide scarp
   recognition/extraction algorithms can provide flexible and effective
   tool for monitoring landslide scarps and is acceptable for landslide
   mapping purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Chiral nanostructures from metals and semiconductors attract wide
   interest as components for polarization-enabled optoelectronic devices.
   Similarly to other fields of nanotechnology, graphene-based materials
   can greatly enrich physical and chemical phenomena associated with
   optical and electronic properties of chiral nanostructures and
   facilitate their applications in biology as well as other areas. Here,
   we report that covalent attachment of L/D-cysteine moieties to the edges
   of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) leads to their helical buckling due to
   chiral interactions at the ``crowded{''} edges. Circular dichroism (CD)
   spectra of the GQDs revealed bands at ca. 210-220 and 250-265 nm that
   changed their signs for different chirality of the cysteine edge
   ligands. The high-energy chiroptical peaks at 210-220 nm correspond to
   the hybridized molecular orbitals involving the chiral center of amino
   acids and atoms of graphene edges. Diverse experimental and modeling
   data, including density functional theory calculations of CD spectra
   with probabilistic distribution of GQD isomers, indicate that the band
   at 250-265 nm originates from the three-dimensional twisting of the
   graphene sheet and can be attributed to the chiral excitonic
   transitions. The positive and negative low-energy CD bands correspond to
   the left and right helicity of GQDs, respectively. Exposure of liver
   HepG2 cells to L/D-GQDs reveals their general biocompatibility and a
   noticeable difference in the toxicity of the stereoisomers. Molecular
   dynamics simulations demonstrated that D-GQDs have a stronger tendency
   to accumulate within the cellular membrane than L-GQDs. Emergence of
   nanoscale chirality in GQDs decorated with biomolecules is expected to
   be a general stereochemical phenomenon for flexible sheets of
   nanomaterials.}},

Abstract = {{A relatively high formation pressure gradient can exist in seepage flow
   in low-permeable porous media with a threshold pressure gradient, and a
   significant error may then be caused in the model computation by
   neglecting the quadratic pressure gradient term in the governing
   equations. Based on these concerns, in consideration of the quadratic
   pressure gradient term, a basic moving boundary model is constructed for
   a one-dimensional seepage flow problem with a threshold pressure
   gradient. Owing to a strong nonlinearity and the existing moving
   boundary in the mathematical model, a corresponding numerical solution
   method is presented. First, a spatial coordinate transformation method
   is adopted in order to transform the system of partial differential
   equations with moving boundary conditions into a closed system with
   fixed boundary conditions; then the solution can be stably numerically
   obtained by a fully implicit finite-difference method. The validity of
   the numerical method is verified by a published exact analytical
   solution. Furthermore, to compare with Darcy's flow problem, the exact
   analytical solution for the case of Darcy's flow considering the
   quadratic pressure gradient term is also derived by an inverse Laplace
   transform. A comparison of these model solutions leads to the conclusion
   that such moving boundary problems must incorporate the quadratic
   pressure gradient term in their governing equations; the sensitive
   effects of the quadratic pressure gradient term tend to diminish, with
   the dimensionless threshold pressure gradient increasing for the
   one-dimensional problem.}},

Abstract = {{Avalanche runout distance and return period estimates are essential to
   snow avalanche risk assessment for hazard mapping and mitigation design.
   We present a validation of the Space-Time (ST) model, a statistical

   validation is based on field observations of tree damage and tree ring
   data of infrequent (1:5 to 1:100 year return period) avalanches from 34
   paths in the Canadian Rocky and Columbia Mountains. While the ST model
   has been applied successfully for a longer return period (>100 year)
   runouts in one path, our validation showed that it does not
   independently estimate infrequent runout distances with sufficient
   accuracy for hazard mapping and mitigation design. As with estimating
   extreme runouts, it should be used in combination with other methods.
   The model was found to perform differently across mountain ranges, and
   tended to estimate runout distance downslope of those observed in the
   field.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{54}},

Abstract = {{In one-of-a-kind production (OKP), how to coordinate workforce
   allocations to obtain reasonable man-hour has the practical
   significance. However, plenty of variables and complicated operation
   relationships are involved, which implies the man-hour optimisation in
   OKP belongs to a constrained mixed discrete optimisation problem. In
   this article, to deal with the man-hour optimisation in large-scale OKP
   which often refers to complex production, e.g. shipbuilding, we
   introduce a top-down refinement method to specialise the product design
   and production decomposition in OKP, which also indicates the operation
   relationships of the interim product production processes. Consequently,
   we suggest three basic task structures which are with wide adaptability
   in OKP industry: tandem structure, parallel structure and
   double-level-nested parallel structure. Meanwhile, for the
   double-level-nested parallel structure, a method based on matrix
   real-coded genetic algorithm and dynamic programming is presented to
   solve the man-hour optimisation and labour force allocation problem.
   Through the case studies, including an industrial implementation in the
   shipbuilding interim product (i.e. a hull block) production, our
   optimisation method demonstrates significant potential to improve the
   production efficiency.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{185}},
Pages = {{87-104}},
Month = {{FEB-MAR}},
Abstract = {{An analytical expression is presented for the shear dispersion during
   solute transport in a coupled system comprised of a capillary tube and a
   porous medium. The dispersion coefficient is derived in a capillary tube
   with a porous wall by considering an accurate boundary condition, which
   is the continuity of concentration and mass flux, at the interface
   between the capillary tube and porous medium A comparison of the
   obtained results with that in a non-coupled system identifies three
   regimes including: diffusion-dominated, transition, and
   advection-dominated. The results reveal that it is essential to include
   the exchange of solute between the capillary tube and porous medium in
   development of the shear dispersion coefficient for the last two
   regimes. The resulting equivalent transport equation revealed that due
   to mass transfer between the capillary tube and the porous medium, the
   dispersion coefficient is decreased while the effective velocity in the
   capillary tube increases. However, a larger effective advection term
   leads to faster breakthrough of a solute and enhances mass delivery to
   the porous medium as compared with the classical double-porosity model
   with a non-coupled dispersion coefficient. The obtained results also
   indicate that the finite porous medium gives faster breakthrough of a
   solute as compared with the infinite one. These results find
   applications in solute transport in porous capillaries and membranes.

   development over dual step cylinders}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This experimental study focuses on the near wake development of a dual
   step cylinder geometry consisting of a long base cylinder of diameter d
   to which a larger diameter (D) cylinder of length L is attached
   coaxially at mid-span. The experiments cover a range of Reynolds
   numbers, 2000 <= Re-D <= 5000, diameter ratios, 1.33 <= D/d <= 2.0 and
   large cylinder aspect ratios, 0.5 <= L/D <= 5 using Tomographic particle
   image velocimetry. Distinct changes in wake topology are observed
   varying the above parameters. Supporting previous experimental studies
   on the same geometry involving flow visualization and planar
   measurements, four distinct flow regimes are identified to which a
   distinct three-dimensional wake topology can be associated. The
   vortex-dominated wake dynamical behaviour is investigated with Proper
   Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and conditional averaging of
   three-dimensional velocity fields is used to exemplify the different
   shedding regimes. The conditionally averaged flow fields are shown to

Abstract = {{The maximum potential for producing light ends under a set of
   operational parameters for oil feedstocks is termed ``crackability{''}.
   When constrained by the appearance of undesirable solid phases, the term
   ``processability{''} applies to, the potential of light ends production.
   These parameters were correlated with the thermal maturity of the
   samples. Thermal maturity was inferred from two proposed indicators: the
   first one was based on the ``delta solubility parameter{''} (Delta PS)
   and the second was based on differential heavy hydrocarbon abundances
   determined by high-temperature simulated distillation
   (Delta\%(C44-C100)). A set of 36 samples that was comprised of oils,
   distillation residua, and thermally cracked residua was studied. Samples
   with increased thermal maturity were found to decrease their
   crackability/processability. Samples with high solubility parameter
   (Delta PS), low Delta\%(C44-C100), and low molecular weight were found
   to have increased thermal maturity. Attempts to correlate saturates,
   aromatics, resins, and asphaltenes (SARA) group-type distributions with
   thermal maturity were not successful. Highly paraffinic samples were
   found to deviate from the determined behavior of studied samples.
   Application of the proposed crackability/processability indicators to
   thermal processing under batch, semi-batch, and continuous setup
   conditions, was found to describe most of the experimentally determined
   results.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY \& FUELS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{871-883}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Biogenic production of coalbed methane under anaerobic conditions occurs
   through a large number of reactions involving a community of
   micro-organisms. We propose a kinetic scheme for this complicated
   reaction network using lumped species reacting in a series of enzymatic
   reaction blocks consisting of coal solubilization, hydrolysis,
   acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis. Among these pathways,
   acetoclastic methanogenesis is assumed to be dominant. Based on
   implications from experimental data, tryptone (a nitrogen rich nutrient
   used in the stimulation of methane production) is assumed to produce
   aromatic ring intermediates. Coal solubilization is described by a
   diffusion layer model. Monod kinetics are applied to model the enzymatic
   reaction rates, but the rate of methanogenesis is modeled, with modified
   Monod kinetics to account for substrate inhibition. An analytical
   solution to the model is derived and its parametric sensitivity is
   investigated in different operating regions. Model parameters are
   estimated from data from various anaerobic bottle experiments conducted
   by us using nonlinear regression with the particle swarm optimization
   algorithm, and the model's predictive ability has been validated for
   various coal samples from the literature, too. The predictive kinetic
   model thus established provides estimates of the concentration of
   products as well as intermediate species in the conversion of coal. The
   model can be used to optimize biogenic methane production from coal at
   different scales ranging from coreflooding experiments to the reservoir
   and field scales.}},

Volume = {{111}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Carbonate reservoirs are considered to be in the range of mixed to oil
   wetting state. Their present wetting state seems unfavorable to recover
   more oil via conventional waterflooding especially as the water cut
   increases with huge residual oil saturation. In recent years, studies
   have shown that tuning the injected brine chemistry can help decrease
   the oil-wetness, resulting in additional oil recovery and reduction in
   residual oil saturation. Thus, rock wettability is being dictated by the
   surface chemistry associated with the water-film stability between crude
   oil and the rock surface. This study presents series of experiments
   conducted on Middle Eastern carbonate core plugs at high pressure and
   high temperature in order to determine the impact of sulfate ions in
   smart brine on oil recovery. Each experiment was initially conducted
   using the formation brine, and subsequently, various versions of
   seawater with varying sulfate concentrations were used. Coreflooding
   experiments showed an additional recovery of about 7-9 \% oil originally
   in core when sulfate concentration was increased while none when
   decreased. Decrease in rock oil-wetness was observed to be responsible
   for the improved recovery as demonstrated by the contact angle analysis.
   Similar trend was observed with the zeta potential analysis which
   further proved that the magnitude of surface charge alteration
   contributes immensely to wettability modification toward more
   water-wetness.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a geographical and computational modelling approach
   to explore the nonlinear relationship between land use types and
   geospatial driving factors. It focuses on the dynamism of land use
   characteristics in a cross-border region. The developed model is based
   on fully integrated Cellular Automata (CA), Geographic Information
   System (GIS) and Decision Learning Tree (DLT) model, which is used to
   define the CA transition rules. Existing literature considers CA as one
   of the most relevant tools for modelling spatial changes over time,
   particularly when complex systems such as land use are involved. The
   literature also highlights that, when CA is combined with other tools,
   results lead to a better spatial prospect of land use dynamics. Our
   results reveal how land use is structured around both the transportation
   system and the border, and how measuring accessibility from different
   angles using GIS platform permits analysis of the temporal and spatial
   discontinuity of land use itself, thereby identifying the discontinuity
   components of land use patterns determined by land use boundaries. (C)

Abstract = {{Layers of faceted crystals were grown from naturally fallen snow above
   wet snow layers in a temperature-controlled laboratory. Static loads
   were then applied to the weak layers to represent overburden snow.
   Eleven experiments with constant loads were analyzed, equivalent to 260
   to 1500 Pa of overburden stress. The density of the slab above the weak
   layer increased with time, following a power law relationship with an
   average exponent of 0.10. Shear strength of the weak layer increased
   with time for all experiments, also following a power law relationship.
   Early-time rates of strength gain averaged 250 Pa.day(-1) for the
   constant-load experiments over the first 3-5 days, decreasing to an
   average of <1 Pa.day(-1) after approximately 30 days. Exponents for the
   power law relationships ranged between 0.09 and 0.35 with an average of
   0.26 +/- 0.08. Sintering was likely the dominant process for strength
   gain, although densification probably contributed as well. Three
   experiments were conducted in which the overburden was increased in
   stages; these exhibited an average strength gain rate of 270 Pa.day(-1)
   over 4-8 days with approximately linear relationships, highlighting the
   importance of cumulative snowfall for layer strength gain.}},

Volume = {{533}},
Pages = {{15-27}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A mathematical model for predicting hydraulic and water quality
   performance in both the short- and long-term is proposed based on field
   measurements for three types of permeable pavements: porous asphalt
   (PA), porous concrete (PC), and permeable inter-locking concrete pavers
   (PICP). The model was applied to three field-scale test sites in
   Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The model performance was assessed in terms of
   hydraulic parameters including time to peak, peak flow and water balance
   and a water quality variable (the removal rate of total suspended
   solids). A total of 20 simulated storm events were used for model
   calibration and verification processes. The proposed model can simulate
   the outflow hydrographs with a coefficient of determination (R-2)
   ranging from 0.762 to 0.907, and normalized root-mean-square deviation
   (NRMSD) ranging from 13.78\% to 17.83\%. Comparison of the time to peak
   flow, peak flow, runoff volume and TSS removal rates between the
   measured and modeled values in model verification phase had a maximum
   difference of 11\%. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is
   capable of capturing the temporal dynamics of the pavement performance.
   Therefore, the model has great potential as a practical modeling tool
   for permeable pavement design and performance assessment. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{One in five patients undergoing endovascular coiling (the current
   standard of care for treating intracranial aneurysms) experience a
   recurrence of the aneurysm as a result of improper healing. Recurrence
   remains the only major drawback of the coiling treatment and has been
   the focus of many studies over the last two decades. Cell therapy, a
   novel treatment modality in which therapeutic cells are introduced to
   the site of the injury to promote tissue regeneration, has opened up new
   possibilities for treating aneurysms. The healing response that ensues
   aneurysm embolization includes several cellular processes that can be
   targeted with cell therapy to prevent the aneurysm from recurring. Ten
   preclinical studies involving cell therapy to treat aneurysms were
   published between 1999 and 2014. In this review, we summarize the
   results of these studies and discuss advances, shortcomings, and the

Abstract = {{Phototrophic microorganisms have been proposed as an alternative to
   capture carbon dioxide (CO2) and to produce biofuels and other valuable
   products. Low CO2 absorption rates, low volumetric productivities, and
   inefficient downstream processing, however, currently make algal
   biotechnology highly energy intensive, expensive, and not economically
   competitive to produce biofuels. This mini-review summarizes advances
   made regarding the cultivation of phototrophic microorganisms at highly
   alkaline conditions, as well as other innovations oriented toward
   reducing the energy input into the cultivation and processing stages. An
   evaluation, in terms of energy requirements and energy return on energy
   invested, is performed for an integrated high-pH, high-alkalinity growth
   process that uses biofilms. Performance in terms of productivity and
   expected energy return on energy invested is presented for this process
   and is compared to previously reported life cycle assessments (LCAs) for
   systems at near-neutral pH. The cultivation of alkaliphilic phototrophic
   microorganisms in biofilms is shown to have a significant potential to
   reduce both energy requirements and capital costs.}},

Title = {{Spatiotemporal dynamics of cortical perfusion in response to thalamic
   deep brain stimulation}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{126}},
Pages = {{131-139}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has revolutionized the treatment of
   movement disorders. The parameters of electrical stimulation are
   important to its therapeutic effect and remain a source of clinical
   controversy. DBS exerts its actions not only locally at the site of
   stimulation but also remotely through afferent and efferent connections,
   which are vital to its clinical effects. Yet, only a few studies have
   examined how cortical activity changes in response to various electrical
   parameters. Here, we investigated how the parameters of thalamic DBS
   alter cortical perfusion in rats using intrinsic optical imaging. We
   hypothesized that thalamic DBS will increase perfusion in primary motor
   cortex (M1), proportional to amplitude, pulse width, or frequency of the
   stimulation applied. We applied 45 different combinations of amplitude,
   pulsewidth and frequency in the ventro-lateral (VL) nucleus of the
   thalamus in anesthetized rats while measuring perfusion in M1. VL
   thalamic DBS reduced cortical reflectance, which corresponds to an
   increase in cortical perfusion. We computed themaximumchange in
   reflectance (MCR) as well as the spatial spread of MCR in each trial.
   Both MCR and spatial spread increased linearly with increases in current
   amplitude or pulse width of stimulation; however, the effect of
   frequency was non-linear. Stimulation at 20 Hz was significantly
   different from that at higher frequencies while stimulation at higher
   frequencies did not differ significantly from each other. Moreover, the
   effect of pulse width on MCR was larger than the effect of amplitude.
   The proportional increase in M1 perfusion due to increase in amplitude
   or pulse width suggests that both activate more neural elements and
   increase the volume of tissue activated. These results should help
   clinicians set parameters of DBS. The use of optical imaging to monitor
   effects of DBS on M1 may not only help understand DBS mechanisms, but
   may also provide feedback for closed loop DBS devices. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Uncertainties associated with decision making regarding tornado warnings
   can lead to false warnings and missed events. A false warning is a
   situation when the public is warned about a tornado and one does not
   actually occur. A missed event is a catastrophic situation where a
   tornado touchdown occurs without an advance warning. This paper mainly
   focuses on how false warnings and missed events influence the
   decision-making process of households and forecasters. The underlying
   factors for false warnings and missed events are analyzed in detail.
   Forecasters' decision making about tornado warnings and the public's
   decision to respond to a warning are analyzed using a probabilistic
   decision-tree approach. A logical basis for decision making is
   developed, and a fundamental inequality for decisions regarding tornado
   warnings is identified. This logical basis is applicable to other
   disasters as well. False warning and missed event probabilities are
   analyzed using the data from the Canadian Prairies. The overall analysis
   is applicable to improve the tornado-warning performance in the Canadian
   Prairies. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{A study was carried out to examine the characteristics of municipal

   Experiments were performed for determining the moisture content,
   proximate and ultimate compositions, heating value of fourteen wastes in
   different categories. Their thermal weight loss behaviors under
   pyrolysis/torrefaction conditions were also investigated in a
   thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). An empirical model was developed for
   the high heating value (HHV) estimation of MSW. A total of 193
   experimental data were collected from this study and those in the
   literature, of which 161 data were used for model derivation; and, 32
   additional data were used for model validation. The model was developed
   using multiple regression analysis and a stepwise regression method: HHV
   (MJ/kg) = 0.350 C + 1.01 H - 0.0826 O, which is expressed in terms of
   weight percentages on a dry basis of carbon (C), hydrogen (H) and oxygen
   (O). The validation results suggest that this model was effective in
   producing accurate outputs that were close to the experimental values.
   In addition, it had the lowest error level in comparison with seven
   other models from the literature. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Emerging bioreactor technologies offer an effective way for scaled-up
   production of large numbers of cells for cell therapy applications. One
   of the clinical paradigms where cell therapy can be an asset is
   restorative neurosciences. Nerve repair can benefit from the injections
   of stem cells and/or Schwann cells, acting as a source for axon
   myelination, myelin debris clearance, and trophic support. We have
   adapted microcarrier-based suspension bioreactor culture for Schwann
   cells (SCs) differentiated from a new stem cell source -skin-derived
   precursors (SKPs). SKP-derived SCs attach and grow on different types of
   microcarriers in both static and stirred culture, with Cytodex 3 and
   CultiSpher-S found most effective. Inter-microcarrier migration of
   SKP-SCs represents a key mechanism for rapid expansion and colonization
   in stirred suspension culture. We have shown that microcarrier-expanded
   SKP-SCs cells express Schwann cell markers p75-NTR, GFAP and S100 and
   retain their key ability to myelinate axons both in vitro and in vivo.
   Scaled-up microcarrier-based production of SKP-SCs in suspension

Abstract = {{Beside their biochemical properties, the exceptional mechanical
   characteristics of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) suggested growing a
   reinforced composite material very similar to natural bone in structure
   and chemical composition, but significantly stronger and stiffer. This
   is where biomechanical considerations portray themselves to justify the
   need for further investigations, in order to verify the applicability of
   CNTs as scaffolds that may ease bone regeneration and simultaneously
   raise its mechanical strength and durability. This research, using
   several modeling approaches, attempts to look at some of the mechanical
   changes likely to take place in the promised artificial tissue, while
   considering the relationships between mechanical and living functions of
   bone, particularly the remodeling process. Results suggest that
   notwithstanding the significant improvements induced to the mechanical
   behavior of the artificial tissue, applications of such stiff inclusions

Abstract = {{We present the preparation and electrical characterization of an
   electrically conductive blend of polyaniline (PANi) and SU-8 UV
   micropatternable photoresist that offers promising opportunities for
   MEMS applications. The blend was prepared by shear mixing of PANi and
   SU-8 2010 resist at an rpm of 1,000 for 15 h. The composite was
   spin-coated on a silicon wafer at an 850 rpm in order to achieve a
   thickness of 50 A mu m, followed by soft baking at 70 A degrees C for 35
   min and cooling to room temperature. The desired structures were
   patterned using masked UV exposure for 60 s. Full cross-linking of PANi
   and SU-8 blend was achieved by a post-exposure bake at a temperature of
   90 A degrees C for 25 min, followed by cooling to room temperature. The
   desired electrode structures and trace lines were then developed in SU-8
   developer for 10 min by manual agitation. The fabricated structures were
   characterized under Scanning Electron Microscope and through Electron
   Dispersion X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) demonstrating that good
   patternability was achieved when using photo-initiator (triarylsulfonium
   hexafluoro-anitimonate salts) and gamma-butyrolactone solvents in the
   blend. Further, electrical characterization together with EDS showed
   that an electrically conductive path is formed in the PANI SU-8 2010
   polymer matrix. It is also observed that resistivity as low as 350
   a{''}broken vertical bar-m was achieved at 8.6 wt\% of PANi in SU-8 2010
   polymer matrix.}},

Title = {{Is sample entropy based entropic half-life and de-trended fluctuation
   analysis correlated and do they reflect phase regularity of center of
   pressure measurements?}},
Journal = {{BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{24}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The reshape scale (RS) method computes the transition of Sample Entropy
   (SEn) from low to large values as the scale is increased. At the largest
   scale, SEn asymptotically converges to the maximum SEn evaluated using
   the average of SEn for the fully randomly re-ordered realizations of the
   original signal. The entropic half-life (EnHL) characterizes such a
   transition. The EnHL is the scale representing the midpoint of the
   transition and yields a measure for the temporal degradation of the
   regularity in a signal. In postural balance studies, the EnHL of the
   center of pressure (COP) signal can be interpreted as the time elapsed
   before the old sensory states is no longer utilized by the postural
   control system to adjust the current COP position. Other equally
   sensitive measures of regularity, such as de-trended fluctuation
   analysis (DFA), can be interpreted in the same way; however, it results
   in a dimensionless measure of regularity and complexity.
   The primary objective of this study was to experimentally demonstrate
   the correlation between the scaling exponent a calculated using DFA and
   the inverse of EnHL. When the COP signal was studied in the Fourier
   domain, a non-random structure was observed in the phase of the COP
   signal, which might be related to the neuromuscular characteristics of
   the postural control system. The second objective of this paper was to
   demonstrate that the EnHL and a both retain information contained in the
   phase of the Fourier transformed signal.
   It is shown in this paper that the EnHL and a are both sensitive to
   non-random structures of the phase of the Fourier transformed signal.
   Contrary to a, which is a dimensionless number, the EnHL measures the
   regularity and complexity of the signal in units of time. Therefore, it
   was concluded that the EnHL provides a more physically interpretable and
   intuitively understandable measure of the properties of the control of
   the COP signal. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The solid phase model of Paricaud' is used, in conjunction with the
   predictive Soave-Redlich-Kwong (PSRK) equation of state,(2) to correlate
   the thermodynamic equilibrium conditions of TBAB and TBAC semiclathrates
   formed in the presence of pure gases. Unlike many previous modeling
   efforts, the current approach does not neglect the solubility of the gas
   in the aqueous phase or the presence of water in the vapor phase.
   Rather, the solubility of the gas and molar fraction of water in vapor
   phase are computed from a flash calculation. Furthermore, the new
   approach also computes the Langmuir constants from the Kihara potential
   rather than from the square well potential or from an empirical
   correlation. The new modeling approach is applied to TBAB and TBAC
   semiclathrates that are formed in the presence of Xe, Ar, CH4, CO2, N-2,
   and H-2. For all of the gases, new Kihara potential parameters were
   regressed from the experimental data. It was found that the new approach
   was able to correlate the experimental data to a high degree of accuracy
   with fewer adjustable parameters than all but one of the existing

Title = {{Phase Equilibria of Confined Fluids in Nanopores of Tight and Shale
   Rocks Considering the Effect of Capillary Pressure and Adsorption Film}},
Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL \& ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{798-811}},
Month = {{JAN 27}},
Abstract = {{Because of the effect of nanoscale confinement, the phase behavior of
   fluids confined in nanopores differs significantly from that observed in
   a PVT cell. In this paper, the cubic Peng Robinson equation of state
   (EOS) is coupled with capillary pressure equation and adsorption theory
   to investigate and represent the phase equilibria of pure components and
   their mixtures in cylindrical nanopores. The shift of critical
   properties is also taken into account. Because of the effect of an
   adsorption film, an improved Young-Laplace equation is adopted to
   simulate capillarity instead of the conventional equation. For the
   adsorption behavior, the experimental data of the adsorbent of
   silicalite are used to represent the adsorption behavior of hydrocarbons
   in nanopores. Then a prediction process for the behavior of methane,
   n-butane, n-pentane, n-hexane and their mixtures are performed.
   Furthermore, the results are compared against the available experimental
   data to validate the accuracy of this scheme. An actual Eagle Ford oil
   is also used to examine the performance of our scheme. Results indicate
   that the presence of an adsorption film can further increase the vapor
   liquid equilibrium constant (K-value) and capillary pressure of the
   confined pure-component fluid, especially in the nanopores with a few
   nanometers. The smaller the nanopore radius, the higher the deviation
   between the actual K-value and the estimated value. The capillary
   pressure presents a bilinear relationship with the pore radius in a log
   log plot. For a binary mixture, it is observed the higher the difference
   between the two components, the stronger the nanopore confinement
   effects. For a multicomponent mixture and the real Eagle Ford oil, as
   the pore radius reduces, the bubble point pressure is depressed and the
   dew point pressure is increased. When the adsorption film is neglected,
   the bubble point pressure is overestimated, and the dew point pressure
   is underestimated. For the Eagle Ford oil, when the nanopore radius is
   higher than about 100 nm, the behavior approaches the bulk value and the
   influence of nanopore confinement can be neglected. The depression of
   bubble point pressure of an Eagle Ford oil reservoir well explains the
   behavior of a long-lasting flat producing gas/oil ratio (GOR). The phase
   behavior of tight oil plays an important role in reserve evaluation and
   development process of tight oil reservoirs. This study will shed some
   important insights on the phase behavior of tight oil in nanopores.}},

Abstract = {{For the first time in human history, the majority of the world's
   population resides in urban areas. Therefore, city managers are faced
   with new challenges related to the efficiency, equity and quality of the
   supply of resources, such as water, food and energy. Infrastructure in a
   city can be viewed as service points providing resources. These service
   points function together as a spatially collaborative system to serve an
   increasing population. To study the spatial collaboration among service
   points, we propose a shared network according to human's collective
   movement and resource usage based on data usage detail records (UDRs)
   from the cellular network in a city in western China. This network is
   shown to be not scale-free, but exhibits an interesting triangular
   property governed by two types of nodes with very different link
   patterns. Surprisingly, this feature is consistent with the urban-rural
   dualistic context of the city. Another feature of the shared network is
   that it consists of several spatially separated communities that
   characterize local people's active zones but do not completely overlap
   with administrative areas. According to these features, we propose the
   incorporation of human movement into infrastructure classification. The
   presence of well-defined spatially separated clusters confirms the
   effectiveness of this approach. In this paper, our findings reveal the
   spatial structure inside a city, and the proposed approach provides a
   new perspective on integrating human movement into the study of a
   spatially distributed system.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports the effect of transition metal (TM) substitution on
   the electrical and optical properties of BaCe0.9Sm0.1O3-delta (BCS).
   Concentrations of 510 mol \% of each of Fe and Co have been doped for
   the B-site of BCS by citric acid autocombustion method. Powder X-ray
   diffraction has revealed the formation of an orthorhombic
   perovskite-type structure. FTIR confirmed a distortion in the lattice
   upon TM-doping in BCS. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of 1400
   C sintered samples have manifested a higher densification in
   BaCe0.8Sm0.1Co0.1O3-delta (BCSC10) with a grain size similar to 11 m
   compared to the parent compound BCS (similar to 2 m). Thermogravimetric
   (TG) analysis showed a water uptake in case of
   BaCe0.85Sm0.1Co0.05O3-delta (BCSC5), while BaCe0.85Sm0.1Fe0.05O3-
   delta(BCSF5) did not show a noteworthy uptake of water. TG has also
   proved that the incorporation of Fe and Co in BCS did not improve the
   chemical stability in CO2 at elevated temperature. The band gap
   estimated using Kubelka-Munk model based on the diffuse reflectance data
   was found to be the lowest for BCSC5 (2.47 eV). However, it increases
   upon lowering oxygen partial pressure (pO(2)), which was interpreted by
   a band structure modifications. Among the samples investigated, BCSC10
   sintered at 1400 C showed the highest electrical conductivity of 0.02 S
   cm(-1) in air at 600 C, while its proton mobility appears to be
   negligible under the investigated humidity atmosphere.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a stabilized mixed finite element method for a coupled
   steady Stokes-Darcy problem is proposed and investigated. This method is
   based on two local Gauss integrals for the Stokes equations. Its
   originality is to use a difference between a consistent mass matrix and
   an under-integrated mass matrix for the pressure variable of the coupled
   Stokes-Darcy problem by using the lowest equal-order finite element
   triples. This new method has several attractive computational features:
   parameter free, flexible, and altering the difficulties inherited in the
   original equations. Stability and error estimates of optimal order are
   obtained by using the lowest equal-order finite element triples (P-1 -
   P-1 - P-1) and (Q(1) - Q(1) - Q(1)) for approximations of the velocity,
   pressure, and hydraulic head. Finally, a series of numerical experiments
   are given to show that this method has good stability and accuracy for
   the coupled problem with the Beavers-Joseph-Saffman-Jones and
   Beavers-Joseph interface conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Proteoglycan 4 (PRG4/lubricin) is secreted by cells that reside in
   articular cartilage and line the synovial joint. Lubricin may play a
   role in modulating inflammatory responses through interaction with CD44.
   This led us to examine if lubricin could be playing a larger role in the
   modulation of inflammation/immunity through interaction with Toll-like
   receptors (TLRs). Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) cells overexpressing TLRs
   2, 4 or 5 and surface plasmon resonance were employed to determine if
   full length recombinant human lubricin was able to bind to and activate
   TLRs. Primary human synovial fibroblasts were also examined using flow
   cytometry and Luminex multiplex ELISA. A rat destabilization model of
   osteoarthritis (OA) was used to determine if lubricin injections were
   able to regulate pain and/or inflammation in vivo. Lubricin can bind to
   and regulate the activity of TLRs, leading to downstream changes in
   inflammatory signalling independent of HA. We confirmed these findings
   in vivo through intra-articular injections of lubricin in a rat OA model
   where the inhibition of systemic inflammatory signaling and reduction in
   pain were observed. Lubricin plays an important role in regulating the
   inflammatory environment under both homeostatic and tissue injury
   states.}},

Volume = {{488}},

Abstract = {{Alkaline flooding is a promising enhanced heavy oil recovery method. In
   this paper, this enhanced heavy oil recovery method is investigated in
   terms of its tertiary oil recovery potential and its effects on
   wettability alteration of the porous medium. Core flood tests show that
   the tertiary oil recovery can be greater than 10\% of the initial oil in
   place (IOIP) by NaOH-only flooding or with NaOH and Na2CO3 mixed
   flooding systems. Micromodel experiments show that the wettability of
   the pore walls in the micromodel had been changed from water-wet to
   oil-wet, which can block water channeling and thereby improve the sweep
   efficiency. In order to prove the effect of wettability alteration on
   the enhanced heavy oil recovery, the contact angles of the heavy oil in
   alkaline solution on a quartz substrate have been measured. The results
   show that the contact angle can change from 24 degrees, without alkali,
   to about 160 degrees, under the action of NaOH or Na2CO3. The
   wettability alteration from water-wet to oil-wet can make the heavy oil
   adsorb at the rock surface and block the water channel. Therefore, the
   wettability alteration is one of the important mechanisms for enhanced
   heavy oil recovery by alkaline flooding. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier

Volume = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Citizen participation should be an essential part of an urban planning
   process if the needs of the local population are to be addressed.
   Citizen participation should also improve acceptance of private
   construction projects by residents that live in or near such
   development. A complementary form of citizen participation to public
   planning meetings is to permit citizen engagement via Web 2.0
   technologies, which also has the potential to get citizens involved that
   are usually difficult to reach. We aim to build a social, i.e.
   participatory, planning platform that allows technology savvy citizens
   to inform themselves of future and ongoing development projects and to
   also discuss them online. In this work we discuss the functional needs
   and context-of-use constraints of such an e-planning platform. A
   conceptual model of the technical architecture is outlined and a
   prototype implementation is presented. This prototype is built on free
   and open source software components, including a social network, to
   enable platform adoption in other locations. Finally, we discuss the
   research needs that are to be addressed if the development of
   participatory e-planning platforms should advance.}},

Abstract = {{Today's Internet suffers from a very complex problem-congestion. It is
   one of the top-ten listed fundamentally important problems in
   networking. It causes many important data to be lost. Wastage of network
   resources results from this. It makes the network easily become
   gridlocked, with little or no data being transported end-to-end. To
   protect data transfer from this problem various models of TCP are
   proposed. These variants differ from each other based on the congestion
   control algorithm and segment loss recovery techniques they use. One of
   the techniques is TCP NewReno. In this paper throughput analysis of a
   simple stochastic model for TCP NewReno is described as a mathematical
   relation of time that it takes for a signal to be sent plus the length
   of time it takes for an acknowledgment of that signal to be received and
   also loss behavior which is based on some previous work done over TCP
   Reno. It has dissimilarity in three characteristics: model for fast
   recovery, formulation of timeout behavior, and use of loss event. Here a
   two-parameter loss model is used that can better represent the diverse
   packet loss framework encountered by TCP on the Internet. The
   significant performance advantages of TCP NewReno over TCP Reno are
   shown using the ns-2 simulator. This performance evaluation is
   considered in case of two queue management mechanisms-DropTail and RED.
   The main outcomes from the experiments are: 1) In a wide range of
   network conditions for TCP NewReno there is an analysis of proposed
   model which can exactly forecast the stable state throughput 2) At the
   time of congestion TCP NewReno perform better than the Reno and 3) The
   packet loss against time during data transmission suffers from less loss
   rate than the existing Reno model.}},

Abstract = {{The use of IPS in Bangladesh is rapidly increasing because of the
   shortfall in electricity generation. The entire energy loss by an
   estimated total number of IPS units would be as high as 46 GWh/year.
   This paper has proposed an alternative solar system to make it
   sustainable and cost effective. It compares a stand-alone rooftop solar
   system and a 100 kWp centrally managed grid-connected system in
   Chittagong. The technical details of the grid-connected system has been
   discussed. It also provides a comparison with the same system installed
   in Berlin, Germany.}},

Abstract = {{The Low Rate Wireless Personal Area network (LR-WPAN), that is IEEE
   802.15.4 is extensively used for many areas of applications. The Slotted
   CSMA/CA mechanism is used by the standard in its contention access
   period (CAP) in beacon enabled mode. The protocol supported a binary
   exponential backoff (BEB) algorithm. In this paper, we investigate the
   saturation throughput, mean frame service time or delay and energy of
   this standard using the existing BEB algorithm and compares it with
   three other backoff schemes-exponential increase exponential decrease
   (EIED), exponential increase linear decrease (EILD), and exponential
   increase multiplicative decrease (EIMD) algorithm. From simulation
   results, it is obtained that EIED, EILD, EIMD performs better than BEB
   for higher loads that is EIED, EILD, EIMD has better throughput, less
   delay, using minimal power. The EIED propagates the highest throughput,
   less delay and minimal energy used among all of these schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Horizontal-axis wind turbines often operate with unequally performing
   blades. A simple extension of blade element analysis for unequal blades
   is developed using the two-dimensional cascade analogue of wind
   turbines. The vortex strengths of the blade elements can vary with blade
   number. For three-bladed rotors, the unequal strengths induce an extra
   velocity at each blade, but for two blades there is no additional
   velocity. For both blade numbers, there is a modification to the
   rotational inflow factor. To determine the significance of blade
   differences, test calculations are presented for two-and three-bladed
   turbines with different blade pitch angles. The modifications proposed
   here do not substantially alter the calculations of turbine power and
   thrust near the point of maximum performance. However, some substantial
   differences were found at higher thrust. Furthermore, the new method
   predicts much larger variations in the blade element torque between the
   blades in the hub region for most operating conditions.}},

   outliers of earthen site monitoring data with wireless sensor network
   (WSN). A data cleaning method, named DC\_ESVS is proposed, which is
   based on the temporal and spatial characteristics of monitoring data
   with WSN. Using the cubic exponential smoothing algorithm and voting
   strategy, it can denoise and detect outliers of earthen site monitoring
   data based on the decision rule. We conduct various experiments on the
   dataset of the monitoring data of Xi'an Tang Hanguangmen city wall site
   with WSN to show detection accuracy of the presented method.
   Experimental results on anther dataset of the monitoring data of the
   Ming Great Wall in Shaanxi also show good performance of the proposed

Abstract = {{In this paper, we discuss the methodology of height datum unification by
   means of the Geodetic Boundary Value Problem (GBVP) approach and tide
   gauge information. We apply the global multiple vertical datum GBVP
   approach with an observation equation for the datum offset written in
   terms of the ellipsoidal height of the mean sea level at a tide gauge,
   the height of mean sea level in the national vertical datum and the
   geoid height. An example is given for CGVD28 and NAVD88 datums in North
   America. A few issues related to the geoid height are studied: the
   magnitude of the so-called indirect bias term, as well as the GOCE
   global geopotential model (GGM) commission and omission errors and their
   effect on the accuracy of the computed datum offsets. It is shown that
   the indirect bias term is below 1 cm if a residual Stokes's kernel is
   used, which corresponds to a degree and order 180 of the GOCE GGM. The
   GOCE geoid commission error computed from the time-wise approach GGM of
   degree 180 is 2-3 cm at the North American tide gauges. The GOCE GGM
   omission error could affect the computed mean vertical datum offsets at
   the tide gauges by as much as 7 cm.}},

Abstract = {{It is recognized that the semantic space of knowledge is a hierarchical
   concept network. This paper presents theories and algorithms of
   hierarchical concept classification by quantitative semantic relations
   via machine learning based on concept algebra. The equivalence between
   formal concepts are analyzed by an Algorithm of Concept Equivalence
   Analysis (ACEA), which quantitatively determines the semantic similarity
   of an arbitrary pair of formal concepts. This leads to the development
   of the Algorithm of Relational Semantic Classification (ARSC) for
   hierarchically classify any given concept in the semantic space of
   knowledge. Experiments applying Algorithms ACEA and ARSC on 20 formal
   concepts are successfully conducted, which encouragingly demonstrate the
   deep machine understanding of semantic relations and their quantitative
   weights beyond human perspectives on knowledge learning and natural
   language processing.}},

Abstract = {{Big data are one of the representative phenomena of the information era
   of human societies. A basic study on the cognitive foundations of big
   data science is presented with a coherent set of general principles and
   analytic methodologies for big data manipulations. It leads to a set of
   mathematical theories that rigorously describe the general patterns of
   big data across pervasive domains in sciences, engineering, and
   societies. A significant finding towards big data science is that big
   data systems in nature are a recursive n dimensional typed
   hyperstructure (RNTHS). The fundamental topological property of big data
   system enables the inherited complexities and unprecedented challenges
   of big data to be formally dealt with as a set of denotational
   mathematical operations in big data engineering. The cognitive
   relationship and transformability between data, information, knowledge,
   and intelligence are formally revealed towards big data science.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents a design of a broad band high-efficiency class-E
   power amplifier (PA) for the advanced efficiency enhancement
   architectures applications. The design approach is based on presenting
   very high output reflection coefficient for a class E amplifier over
   broad band frequencies. An infinite reflection coefficient at load over
   the broadband frequency range enhances the application of class-E PAs as
   peaking amplifier in advanced efficiency enhancement architectures like
   Doherty, delta sigma etc. The proposed approach is validated using a
   Cree 6 W GaN prototype for a frequency band between 1.8-2.7 GHz. The
   prototype outputs more than 38 dBm output power with the drain
   efficiency higher than 55\% over 40\% of the fraction bandwidth. The
   drain voltage sweep of the fabricated PA shows that it can be also be
   employed in load modulated dual branch amplifiers and envelop tracking
   transmitter structures.}},

   measure the interaction between participants and three user interfaces:
   traditional interface based on cardboard cards, Graphic User Interface
   (GUI) based on digital cards and Tangible User Interface (TUI) based on
   3D letters and low cost toys with RFID tags. The method consisted of the
   registration of occurrences in the behavior of participants. The results
   obtained from the application of the Friedman test confirmed the
   exploratory findings carried out in a qualitative previous work, in
   which TUI improves the interaction in early literacy process of Down

   highest variability and a the lowest in this setup. The combinations
   R-1/R-0 and tau = (R1C)(1/alpha), show lower variability than R-1, R-0,

Abstract = {{A mixerless polar transmitter architecture using an analog RF variable
   gain amplifier (VGA) and an analog phase shifter is proposed and
   implemented. This architecture avoids the use of nonlinear switching
   mixers and quadrature modulator circuits for frequency up-conversion.
   Thus, spurs and distortion common to mixer circuits are absent and
   therefore the proposed architecture does not require any filtering at
   its RF output. Hence, the proposed topology can be implemented for wider
   RF bandwidths and is more reconfigurable for multi-standard and Software
   Defined Radio applications. The unusual nonlinear behavior of the
   proposed polar transmitter was analyzed and mitigated using a new
   modified memory polynomial model. The proposed architecture achieved an
   EVM of 0.92 \% for an LTE signal of 1.4 MHz bandwidth with 64 QAM
   constellation.}},

Abstract = {{Predicting Web service response time percentiles is often an important
   aspect of service level management exercises. Existing techniques can be
   very time consuming since they involve the manual construction of
   complex analytic or simulation models. To address this problem, we
   propose Prospective, a fully automated and data-driven approach for
   predicting Web service response time percentiles. Prospective relies on
   historical response time data collected from a Web service. Given a
   specification for workload expected at the Web service over a planning
   horizon, Prospective uses this historical data to offer predictions for
   response time percentiles of interest. At the core of Prospective is a
   lightweight simulator that uses collaborative filtering to estimate
   response time behaviour of the service based on behaviour observed
   historically. Results show that Prospective is able to predict various
   response time percentiles of interest with high accuracy for a wide
   variety of workloads.}},
