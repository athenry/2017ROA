Abstract = {{Software agents in Multiagent Systems (MAS) have several interactions
   that are designed and represented in the scenarios of the system. These
   communications should be verified to detect whether the agents will show
   a new behavior in their execution, which is known as emergent behavior
   or implied scenario. Most research use different versions of state
   machines modeling for the detection of implied scenarios, which consider
   the states of one/all agents. The existing detection processes ignore
   the interactions among agents. In this paper, besides modeling the
   states and agents' behaviors, we model the agents' interactions derived
   from their designs, to detect implied scenarios. A new type of implied
   scenario that occurs when a process misses the information about its
   common communications in multiple scenarios is studied in this paper.
   This type of implied scenario cannot be detected with other approaches.
   Various situations that can lead to this implied scenario are ruled.
   Moreover, a detection methodology based on clustering the agents'
   communications from the scenarios of the system is presented. The
   results are verified through a case study.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time analysis of traffic data is a key challenge in intelligent
   transportation system. It aims at discovering useful traffic patterns
   that can help decision makers better manage the transportation system
   and test and introduce new policies. Discovered patterns can also be
   used to support road users to reach their destination safely and with
   reasonable commuting time. In this paper, a number of key challenges
   associated with transportation systems and possible solutions are
   discussed. A method that analyzes real-time traffic data to predict
   future status of traffic flow and incidents is introduced. The proposed
   method includes three phases: offline, real-time, and decision support
   phases. In this paper, a decision tree classification model is
   constructed and validated for an accident dataset. Possible benefits of
   using the constructed model are demonstrated using results of the

Abstract = {{Cities are facing increasingly challenges with the projected population
   growth and the resulting increased urban travel demand. Road safety is a
   major issue in urban planning. Much of the empirical research on road
   safety and determining the probability of accidents has focused on the
   accident events. While human error and mechanical failure are common
   causes of road traffic accidents, the importance of spatial factors has
   been underestimated. Classifications of road accident are generally
   based on the available data associated with the accident itself such as
   time of day, type of injury, type of vehicle, etc. This can often limit
   the understanding of the complexities of road accidents which can be the
   outcome of a number of environmental, social and economic factors
   neglected by the standard accident data collection. This study is based
   on the assumption that road accidents occurring in similar areas are
   spatially dependent because of the increased density of accidents in the
   specific area. This dependence is argued to be the result of a shared
   common cause(s) between the accidents, albeit of varying intensity.
   Analysis of road accidents, particularly the spatial patterns of
   accidents requires further attention. This study aims to highlight some
   of the gaps in the research with particular attention to spatial
   classification of road accidents. This paper proposes an approach
   towards developing a comprehensive classifier system which utilizes
   historical as well as real-time data for any given road and outputs the
   probability of accident on any given time on that road. This classifier
   system is built by considering the exclusive spatial attributes of every
   road to determine the severity and importance of these attribute data on
   frequent accidents.}},

Abstract = {{Constant voltage and frequency can be generated by a stand-alone
   Self-Excited Induction Generator (SEIG) driven with a fixed-speed
   low-head hydro-turbine when the electrical load is maintained constant
   by an Electronic Load Controller (ELC). However for a Conventional-ELC
   (C-ELC) most of the generated electrical energy can be dissipated in the
   dump load if the village load is low. So, the objective of this research
   is designing a simplified ELC for each household to transfer the excess
   power for domestic consumption in addition to providing voltage
   regulation for the generator. A regular ELC, possibly of reduced rated
   power, should still be installed at the generator site. At the same
   time, a simplified and inexpensive ELC is installed at each household.
   The proposed controller, installed in each household, is referred to as
   the Distributed Electronic Load Controller (DELC). MATLAB simulation
   results verify the feasibility of the proposed approach. Experimental
   results using the MSP-430 LaunchPad microcontroller are also presented
   to verify the validity of the proposed DELC approach.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes downlink coverage probability and spectral
   efficiency of Poisson cellular networks with lognormal shadowed Rayleigh
   fading, provided each user is associated to the closest base station
   (BS). Both location-dependent and cell area wide aspects of the coverage
   probability and spectral efficiency metrics are presented. Performance
   impact of system parameters such as frequency reuse factor, transmission
   probability, and Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR) gap from Shannon
   capacity are characterized. Numerical results support the view that
   shadowing significantly degrades the performance. The cell area wide
   spectral efficiency decreases by 37\% when the shadowing standard
   deviation increases from 0dB to 12dB. Finally, the derived results on
   location-dependent metrics are applied to Fractional Frequency Reuse
   (FFR) optimal partitioning in terms of system spectral efficiency, which
   is found dependent on system parameters such as SIR gap from Shannon
   capacity. It is also numerically shown that the FFR significantly
   improves the (link) spectral efficiency for cell edge users. For a user
   far away from its associated BS (at a distance 3 times the radius of
   average cell area) and considering SIR gap from Shannon capacity of 3dB,
   FFR(1,3) improves the (link) spectral efficiency by 239\% compared to
   the universal reuse factor.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of characterizing the quality of
   experience (QoE) of users accessing different types of applications in
   802.11n wireless local area network (WLAN) deployment environments.
   Using the generalized logistic function with fractional powers, an
   analytically tractable QoE model that can be flexibly applied to
   different application types (real time and non-real time) is formulated
   as a function of several quality of service (QoS) parameters. An 802.11n
   WLAN testbed is then used to validate the accuracy of the QoE model via
   experimental QoE measurements. The paper also investigates the impact of
   different network operational parameters including the number of users
   supported, percentage of real time traffic streamed and level of
   co-channel interference on both the QoS and QoE performance. Next, an
   optimization problem is solved to maximize the overall QoE achievable
   subject to the QoS constraints of the applications in use. Overall, the
   developed QoE model can be used as an effective tool for enhancing the
   Access Point (AP) capacity and the QoE performance by optimally adapting
   the network operational parameters.}},

Abstract = {{A stochastic model is presented in this paper for packet-level
   performance analysis of the medium access control (MAC) schemes
   considered for adoption in smart utility networks. Smart grid
   communications involve critical issues in terms of reliability and
   timeliness, and the MAC largely determines efficiency of packet-level
   communication within the immediate neighborhood. Powerline communication
   (PLC), a relatively old communication technology, has reemerged in
   recent times, and is regarded as one of the key enablers in smart grid
   communication. The analytic problem addressed in this paper is
   formulated in light of the distinctive characteristics of some of the
   PLC based MAC schemes, and also relevant to smart grid utility networks,
   e.g., low data rate CSMA/CA with access differentiation. Specifically,
   with consideration of two classes of packets, this paper investigates
   basic performance metrics such as throughput and packet service time in
   view of the effectiveness of the access differentiation mechanisms. The
   evaluation shows that with increase in the number of contending nodes,
   strong discrimination between the classes persists in medium access
   opportunities though both aggregate and class-wise throughputs degrade.}},

   theories and collective decision-making model, we present a three-layer
   model to analyze users' social roles in a hierarchical way, and utilize
   it to support the collective decision-making process. A case study for

Abstract = {{A novel Multi-Resolution Fusion (MRF) of Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet
   Transform (DTCWT) and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is introduced in
   this paper. Shift invariant multi-scale feature set is obtained using 2D
   DTCWT. Subsequently, discriminant DCT coefficients are extracted to map
   the high dimensional features into low dimensional subspace. The
   resulting feature vector contains non-redundant discriminative
   information and is small in size. Therefore, the proposed face
   recognition technique exhibits computational efficiency, low storage
   requirement along with high recognition rate under varying shift
   conditions. It also provides robustness to expression and illumination
   change. The performance evaluation is accomplished on four standard face
   databases. Experimental results show significant performance improvement
   over existing well-established face recognition methods under varying
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) deployed on a shop floor for factory
   automation are subject to dynamic and uncertain conditions present with
   heavy machinery. To overcome these obstacles, on one hand, WSNs should
   be reconfigurable and adaptable to changes in the shop floor and ambient
   condition; on the other hand, WSNs should be efficient in consuming the
   limited wireless network resources. To accomplish these goals, we
   propose two cluster-based architectures (i.e. static or dynamic
   clusters), to organize the overall shop floor into a set of tracking
   zones, each composed of a sink node and a set of closest corresponding
   anchor nodes. To manage the wireless nodes activities and inter and
   intra cluster communications, an agent-based technique is employed. To
   compare the architectures, we report on a set of experiments performed
   in JADE (Java Agent Development Environment). In these experiments, we
   compare two agent-based approaches (dynamic and static) for managing
   clusters of wireless sensor nodes in a distributed tracking system. The
   experimental results corroborate the efficiency of static clusters
   versus the robustness of the dynamic clusters.}},

Abstract = {{In robot-assisted surgery, a critical factor is to handle pose (position
   and orientation) mismatch between a stylus-style hand controller and a
   surgical tool (robot-assisted tool) attached to the end-effector of a
   robot. The mismatch has similar characteristics as robot calibration in
   industrial settings. Nevertheless, any methods for correcting the
   mismatch need to meet certain computation and accuracy requirements,
   which are derived from the constraints of a robot-assisted surgical
   system. On a virtual reality simulator, we use a haptic device (PHANToM
   Premium 1.5/6DOF) as the hand controller to actuate a robot-assisted
   surgical tool via neuroArm - a robotic system in microscopic
   neurosurgery. Within the workspace of the tool, we have defined the
   computation and accuracy requirements of correction as 1.0 ms and 30.0
   mu m, respectively. Towards the correction of the pose mismatch, this
   current work first assesses the suitability of the Newton-Raphson (NR)
   method for addressing the position mismatch between the haptic interface
   point (HIP) of the haptic device and the tooltip of the surgical tool.
   For fast computation, we have modified the NR method to take advantage
   of its quadratic rate of convergence. This modification adds a feedback
   loop for selecting appropriate initial values. As well, we have verified
   the non-singularities of the workspace where the position mismatch needs
   to be corrected. Assessed in the workspace of 90 targets, the modified
   NR method achieves an accuracy between the HIP and the tooltip at about
   1.0 mu m in less than 64 mu s - meeting both requirements of correction.
   Thus, this work confirms the suitability of the modified NR method to
   efficiently correct the position mismatch between the HIP and the
   tooltip on neuroArm.}},

Abstract = {{With the wide spread of user-friendly mobile devices and applications,
   the broadband cellular network experiences a pronounced growth of
   traffic volume, and consumes a large amount of energy. To cope with
   these two challenges, it is important to understand the resource usage
   of base stations, which is the first step to manage the radio spectrum
   resources and network infrastructure efficiently. In this paper, we
   first use the Pearson's correlation to measure the dependency between
   base stations on the time variance of traffic load, which is the most
   direct pattern of resource usage in the cellular data network. By
   concentrating the analysis on relatively higher linear dependency
   between base stations, we construct a network in which the vertex and
   edge represents the base station and significant correlation of traffic
   dynamic between base stations, respectively. We characterize it in a way
   of weighted network, and considering the spatial deployment of base
   stations as well. Our findings are interesting and valuable.
   Specifically, such a network shows a ``long tail{''} degree
   distribution, ``small world{''} phenomenon and low modularity. And the
   spatial deployment of base stations has significant impact to the edge
   weight, rather than the topology.}},

Abstract = {{Although management of Road Safety has been an area of concern over the
   past several decades the following behavior-based problem areas still
   exist: unsafe driving behaviors and high-risk drivers. A Behavior-Based
   Safety Management System (BBSMS) can help address these areas by
   introducing concepts of Activators, Behaviors and their Consequences.
   The focus of BBSMS is on improving and changing behavior rather than
   dealing with the consequences of bad behavior. This paper explores the
   application of Utilization Z-scores and Reliability Demonstration Chart,
   a reliability engineering technique, to help analyze driver behavior.
   The driver behavior is represented by In Vehicle Monitoring System
   (IVMS) data collected over several years. The events recorded and
   monitored by the IVMS include over speeding, over revving, harsh
   acceleration, harsh braking and seat belt disconnects while driving. The
   techniques provide an easy and effective way for drivers and their
   managers to monitor driver risk profiles by classifying and identifying
   drivers with high risks - drivers with a higher probability of
   generating IVMS events. The consequences of the unsafe behavior can then
   be identified and activators can be modified in order to reduce risk. By
   positively influencing the behavior the consequences can be better
   managed to reduce the risks associated with the Safety Management System
   (SMS).}},

   Traditional approaches of path-loss modeling of indoor RFID channel lack
   of the ability to assess the consistency and reliability of the fit. In
   this paper, we propose two approaches to ensure the reliability of the
   goodness-of-fit parameters of a fit and quantify its consistency. The
   first approach uses a standard bootstrap validation method to measure
   the confidence levels of the goodness-of-fit parameters of the fit. The
   second approach combines a bootstrap resampling technique with a
   statistical significance testing method to quantify the consistency of a
   fit across a number of independent experiments obtained in a particular
   indoor environment. We present experimental analysis to show the
   advantages of the proposed approaches over traditional fitting method.
   We suggest that for proper characterization of indoor channel, it is
   required to consider the systematic fluctuations along with the
   path-loss attenuation.}},

   achievable is found to be strongly dependent on the load level and the
   BS power consumption attributes. A multi-objective optimization problem
   that maximizes the SE and EE subject to Quality of Service (QoS)
   constraints is formulated and solved to give the Pareto optimal
   operational regime. In contrast to the conventional approach, this paper
   quantifies the SE-EE tradeoff as a Lebesgue measure, defined by the
   Pareto optimal regime. Numerical results show that while the performance
   improvement achieved by balancing the SE-EE tradeoff is marginal under
   high load conditions, it is feasible to significantly increase the SE
   and EE during low load conditions and satisfy the users' QoS
   requirements by optimally adapting the network configuration.}},

Abstract = {{A two-hop socially aware resource allocation scheme is proposed for
   device-to-device communication in the downlink of Orthogonal Frequency
   Division Multiple Access networks. An optimization problem has been
   formulated with the objective to maximize the overall network utility
   and the data rate achieved by the users of a network plagued by limited
   bandwidth, limited power and user selfishness. Degree and eigenvalue
   centrality metrics capture the social awareness of the users. The mixed
   integer non-linear programming problem formulated is solved using the
   advanced integrated multidimensional modeling system optimization
   solvers. The proposed scheme is compared to conventional allocation
   schemes using system spectral efficiency, system fairness index and
   overall network utility performance metrics. Numerical results show that
   employing the proposed scheme in dense networks achieves performance
   improvement of approximately 75\% in terms of spectral efficiency, up to
   50\% in terms of fairness and up to 7\% in terms of utility over the
   conventional schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-user usability of collaborative virtual environments (VEs) require
   the consideration of users' socio-human needs. However, most
   investigations of the usability have focused on either the technologies
   involved or individual user experience. Few have examined the effect of
   interaction models on multi-user usability, by taking account the
   socio-human needs. Thus, we have undertaken a study on such effect for
   collaborative tasks, comparing two interaction models:
   first-come-first-serve (FCFS) and dynamic priority (DP). Departing
   largely from our previous verification of these models for conflict
   resolution, the current study assessed multi-user usability for
   achieving a collaborative goal in a quasi-practical scenario. Based on
   the ISO/IEC 25010:2011 standard on usability, our observations revealed
   that multiple users completed the collaborative tasks statistically more
   effective, efficient, and satisfactory under the DP model than under the
   FCFS model. These observations indicate a potential practicality of the
   DP model for multi-user VEs, in which experts perform collaborative
   tasks.}},

Abstract = {{Location recommendation provides unvisited locations to the users for
   the rapidly growing location-based social networks. The service is based
   on the users' visiting histories and location related information such
   as location categories. In this paper, we propose a location
   recommendation algorithm called sPCLR that recommends locations to the
   users at a given time of the day by utilizing category information. The
   algorithm considers both temporal and spatial components. The temporal
   component utilizes the temporal influence of similar users' check-in
   behaviors by representing a user's periodic check-in behavior at
   different location categories as temporal curves. The similarity between
   users' periodic check-in behavior is calculated based on the difference
   between temporal curves. The spatial component utilizes the geographical
   influence of locations and filters out those locations that are not of
   interest to the user. The performance of sPCLR is compared with three
   existing location recommendation algorithms on a real-world dataset.
   Experimental results show that the sPCLR algorithm performs better than
   all other three algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{A liquefied natural gas (LNG) carrier is designed to transport LNG over
   a long distance. During transportation, the leakage of boil-off gas
   (BOG) along with poor ventilation can pose an explosion risk. The
   traditional method for dealing with the BOG is to burn the gas to power
   the ship. As an alternative method, re-liquefaction plants on board
   re-liquefy the vapours back to the cargo tanks. This project will
   characterize the technical issues associated with fire protection in a
   confined space where LNG boil-off re-liquefaction takes place and will
   demonstrate what the appropriate ventilation rate in an emergency is. In
   addition, the CFD software (ANSYS CFX) is applied to simulate the
   ventilation and burning of boil-off gas in the on board re-liquefaction
   plant to ensure the safety of the cargo tanks for the worst case
   scenario.
   The traditional method for dealing with the boil-off gas (BOG) on board
   an LNG carrier is to burn the gas to power the ship. As an alternative
   method, re-liquefaction plants on board re-liquefy the vapour back to
   the cargo tanks {[}1]. In the last few years, the introduction of LNG
   re-liquefaction systems has given ship owners a choice of fuels and
   provides engine redundancy. Nevertheless, flammable natural gas is
   processed in both methods. Due to the inherent properties of a ship's
   structure, the re-liquefaction system, gas combustion unit, pipelines,
   etc. are located in the space enclosed under the deck. Under certain
   circumstances the leakage of natural gas, along with poor ventilation,
   can pose an explosion risk. Unfortunately, limited industry codes have
   been developed for fire protection in the cabin where the innovative LNG
   re-liquefaction system is located. The purpose of this project is to
   demonstrate the leaking and burning of boil-off gas in the on board
   re-liquefaction plant to ensure the safety of the cargo tanks for the
   worst case scenario by using CFD simulation software.}},

   tracking, and pseudorange errors are compared between single antenna
   reception and dual antenna spatial diversity reception for different

Abstract = {{Signal acquisition is the first operation stage of a GPS receiver that
   detects the presence of GPS signals and provides a coarse estimate of
   the code delay and Doppler frequency. GPS signal acquisition becomes a
   challenging problem when the signal is subject to attenuation and
   multipath fading. In practice, standard methods such as extending the
   integration time without any aiding information to increase processing
   gain are not always sufficient to acquire weak signals. This difficulty
   can be characterized by the probability of detection, false alarm and
   mean acquisition time. This paper exploits spatial antenna diversity to
   mitigate the multipath fading effect in the acquisition process. Equal
   gain combining of two independent antennas is considered in a standalone
   processing strategy. The performance is evaluated in terms of Receiver
   Operating Characteristic (ROC). The theoretical analysis is compared
   with Monte Carlo simulations and real GPS data results. Experimental
   results demonstrate the improvement of detection probability and
   enhanced immunity against false alarms in dense multipath environments.}},

Abstract = {{Collective Detection is an Assisted-GNSS (A-GNSS) technique for direct
   positioning, where the information from all satellites in view is
   combined to enable rapid acquisition and a direct navigation solution.
   This technique is shown to perform effectively in weak signal
   environments like indoor navigation, reducing the required signal
   strength by 10 to 20 dB-Hz. When the signal from satellites cannot be
   acquired individually, Collective Detection constructively adds
   information from each satellite together, thus improving sensitivity and
   directly leading to a position solution. In a sense, the vector-based
   approach used generally in tracking, is extended to the acquisition
   stage. However, the existing Collective Detection techniques are
   computationally intensive and thus have limited practical applications.
   Also, the transmit-time assistance provided to the receiver is assumed
   to be of sub-millisecond accuracy, which is not a feasible assumption.
   This paper looks at these limitations of Collective Detection and aims
   to mitigate them under the assumption that at least one satellite can be
   acquired individually. It has been shown that the proposed Accelerated
   Collective Detection is faster and more efficient than the traditional
   scheme, and performs equally well in terms of accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{The locations of WiFi access points (APs) are important for WiFi
   positioning, especially when a propagation model is used. However, AP
   localization is usually challenging in a new environment because it is
   hard to obtain parameters for the propagation model, such as the
   path-loss exponent without the presence of surveyed database. This paper
   introduces a novel crowdsourcing method for automatic AP localization
   and propagation parameters (PPs) estimation based on the navigation
   solution from the Trusted Portable Navigator (T-PN). The estimation for
   PPs and AP locations based on non-linear weighted least squares (LSQ) is
   carried out automatically when enough measurements are collected, and
   the results are recorded in the database for future use. The fast
   estimation method calculates the propagation parameters autonomously and
   adaptively to account for the dynamic indoor environment. The autonomous
   system will also reduce the labour and time costs for the pre-survey and
   maintenance of databases, as the crowdsourcing is always done in
   background processes on devices. The accuracy of AP localization is also
   estimated and recorded in the database, providing an important indicator
   when using the AP localization results. The performance of the proposed
   system is evaluated by both simulations and field tests, and the result
   shows that the average AP localization errors are less than 6 meters.}},

Abstract = {{The quality of a microwave breast image is gaged in part by the
   resolution of the recorded scatter fields. Deconvolution is applied to
   improve the signal resolution and yield a representation of subsurface
   reflectivity by compressing the excitation pulse in the recorded
   signals. As the electromagnetic wave propagates through lossy and
   dispersive breast tissues, the waveform is distorted due to the
   frequency dependent attenuation. This imposes challenges on the
   stationary deconvolution techniques, which assume a time-invariant
   propagating wavelet. In this paper, we apply Gabor non-stationary
   deconvolution to compensate for these dissipative and dispersive
   effects. Results demonstrate that this method provides a more accurate
   estimate of the reflectivity of the imaged object and shows ability to
   compensate for the wave attenuation and correct the waveform distortion.}},

Pages = {{431-441}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Up to 80\% of heavy oil reservoirs in Western Canada are less than 5 m
   thick and as yet the only economic processes are cold production ones
   which realize recovery factors between 10\% and 15\%. This implies that
   >85\% of the oil remains in the ground after the process becomes
   uneconomic to continue operation. At this time, no thermal processes
   exist that are economic. Here, a reservoir simulation study was
   conducted to guide the design of thermal recovery processes for a heavy
   oil reservoir with a thickness of 4 m by comparing different operating
   strategies including Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD), steam
   flooding, hot water flooding, and alternating steam/hot water flooding.
   A base case of cold production (without sand) was also done for
   comparison purposes. It was found that the cold production case was not
   viable with very low recovery factor. Higher recovery factor was
   achieved by using SAGD strategy but at a poorer thermal efficiency.
   Steam flooding operations exhibits better performance than SAGD in terms
   of heat utilization. However, its high heat loss to the over and
   underburden leads to higher cumulative-energy-injected-to-oil ratio
   (cEOR). Hot water flooding, however, achieved oil production rates
   comparable to steam flooding at much lower cEOR. The flood cases are
   tested at different well separations. However, the results suggest that
   hot water flooding alone may not be the target process of choice for
   thin heavy oil reservoirs and solvents may be needed to lower the energy
   intensity further. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The last two decades have witnessed a huge growth in the demand for
   geo-spatial data. This demand has encouraged researchers around the
   world to develop new algorithms and design new mapping systems in order
   to obtain reliable sources for geo-spatial data. Mobile Mapping Systems
   (MMS) are one of the main sources for mapping and Geographic Information
   Systems (GIS) data. MMS integrate various remote sensing sensors, such
   as cameras and LiDAR, along with navigation sensors to provide the 3D
   coordinates of points of interest from moving platform (e.g. cars, air
   planes, etc.). Although MMS can provide accurate mapping solution for
   different GIS applications, the cost of these systems is not affordable
   for many users and only large scale companies and institutions can
   benefits from MMS systems.
   The main objective of this paper is to propose a new low cost MMS with
   reasonable accuracy using the available sensors in smartphones and its
   video camera. Using the smartphone video camera, instead of capturing
   individual images, makes the system easier to be used by
   non-professional users since the system will automatically extract the
   highly overlapping frames out of the video without the user
   intervention. Results of the proposed system are presented which
   demonstrate the effect of the number of the used images in mapping
   solution. In addition, the accuracy of the mapping results obtained from
   capturing a video is compared to the same results obtained from using
   separate captured images instead of video.}},

Abstract = {{Most of LiDAR systems do not provide the end user with the calibration
   and acquisition procedures that can use to validate the quality of the
   data acquired by the airborne system. Therefore, this system needs data
   Quality Control (QC) and assessment procedures to verify the accuracy of
   the laser footprints and mainly at building edges. This research paper
   introduces an efficient method for validating the quality of the
   airborne LiDAR point clouds data using terrestrial laser scanning data
   integrated with edge detection techniques. This method will be based on
   detecting the edge of buildings from these two independent systems.
   Hence, the building edges are extracted from the airborne data using an
   algorithm that is based on the standard deviation of neighbour point's
   height from certain threshold with respect to centre points using radius
   threshold. The algorithm is adaptive to different point densities. The
   approach is combined with another innovative edge detection technique
   from terrestrial laser scanning point clouds that is based on the height
   and point density constraints. Finally, statistical analysis and
   assessment will be applied to compare these two systems in term of edge
   detection extraction precision, which will be a priori step for 3D city
   modelling generated from heterogeneous LiDAR systems.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the low-cost and off-the-shelf availability of consumer grade
   cameras, multi-camera photogrammetric systems have become a popular
   means for 3D reconstruction. These systems can be used in a variety of
   applications such as infrastructure monitoring, cultural heritage
   documentation, biomedicine, mobile mapping, as-built architectural
   surveys, etc. In order to ensure that the required precision is met, a
   system calibration must be performed prior to the data collection
   campaign. This system calibration should be performed as efficiently as
   possible, because it may need to be completed many times. Multi-camera
   system calibration involves the estimation of the interior orientation
   parameters of each involved camera and the estimation of the relative
   orientation parameters among the cameras. This paper first reviews a
   method for multi-camera system calibration with built-in relative
   orientation constraints. A system stability analysis algorithm is then
   presented which can be used to assess different system calibration
   outcomes. The paper explores the required calibration configuration for
   a specific system in two situations: major calibration (when both the
   interior orientation parameters and relative orientation parameters are
   estimated), and minor calibration (when the interior orientation
   parameters are known a-priori and only the relative orientation
   parameters are estimated). In both situations, system calibration
   results are compared using the system stability analysis methodology.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past few years, laser scanning systems have been acknowledged
   as the leading tools for the collection of high density 3D point cloud
   over physical surfaces for many different applications. However, no
   interpretation and scene classification is performed during the
   acquisition of these datasets. Consequently, the collected data must be
   processed to extract the required information. The segmentation
   procedure is usually considered as the fundamental step in information
   extraction from laser scanning data. So far, various approaches have
   been developed for the segmentation of 3D laser scanning data. However,
   none of them is exempted from possible anomalies due to disregarding the
   internal characteristics of laser scanning data, improper selection of
   the segmentation thresholds, or other problems during the segmentation
   procedure. Therefore, quality control procedures are required to
   evaluate the segmentation outcome and report the frequency of instances
   of expected problems. A few quality control techniques have been
   proposed for the evaluation of laser scanning segmentation. These
   approaches usually require reference data and user intervention for the
   assessment of segmentation results. In order to resolve these problems,
   a new quality control procedure is introduced in this paper. This
   procedure makes hypotheses regarding potential problems that might take
   place in the segmentation process, detects instances of such problems,
   quantifies the frequency of these problems, and suggests possible
   actions to remedy them. The feasibility of the proposed approach is
   verified through quantitative evaluation of planar and
   linear/cylindrical segmentation outcome from two recently-developed
   parameter-domain and spatial-domain segmentation techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Terrestrial Laser Scanners (TLS) are utilized through different data
   acquisition techniques such as Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) and the
   output can be used in different applications such as 3D city modelling,
   cultural heritage documentations, oil and Gas as built, etc... In this
   research paper, we will investigate one of the modes of TLS on mobile
   mapping platform. Namely the Stop-and-Go (SAG) mode. Unlike the
   continuous mode, the Stop-and-Go mode does not require the use of IMU to
   estimate the TLS attitude and thus inturn it has an overall reduction in
   the system cost. Moreover, it decreases the time required for data
   processing in comparison with the continuous mode. For successful use of
   SAG mobile mapping in urban areas, it is preferred to use a long range
   time of flight laser scanner to cover long distances in each scan and
   minimize the registration error. The problem arise with Long range laser
   scanners is their low point cloud density. The low point cloud density
   affects the registration accuracy specially in monitoring applications.
   The point spacing between points is one of the issues facing the
   registration especially when the matching points are chosen manually.
   Since most of TLS nowadays are equipped with camera on-board we can
   utilize the camera to get an initial estimate of the registration
   parameters based on image matching. After having an initial
   approximation of the registration parameters we feed those parameters to
   the Iterative Closest Point algorithm to obtain more accurate
   registration result.}},

Abstract = {{3D model of indoor environments provide rich information that can
   facilitate the disambiguation of different places and increases the
   familiarization process to any indoor environment for the remote users.
   In this research work, we describe a system for visual odometry and 3D
   modeling using information from RGB-D sensor (Camera). The visual
   odometry method estimates the relative pose of the consecutive RGB-D
   frames through feature extraction and matching techniques. The pose
   estimated by visual odometry algorithm is then refined with iterative
   closest point (ICP) method. The switching technique between ICP and
   visual odometry in case of no visible features suppresses inconsistency
   in the final developed map. Finally, we add the loop closure to remove
   the deviation between first and last frames. In order to have a semantic
   meaning out of 3D models, the planar patches are segmented from RGB-D
   point clouds data using region growing technique followed by convex hull
   method to assign boundaries to the extracted patches. In order to build
   a final semantic 3D model, the segmented patches are merged using
   relative pose information obtained from the first step.}},

   The validation of our analysis is performed using a 10-Watt Gallium

   in Advanced Design Systems (ADS). These PAs are operated in Class-J,
   continuous class-F and continuous inverse class-F, respectively.
   Distinctive performance in terms of drain efficiency, output power and
   transducer gain over wide frequency band is exhibited. The operational

Abstract = {{Our goal is to support capacity management for systems such as
   hospitals, campuses, and cities, which utilize resources such as people,
   places, and things in complex ways. Simulation tools have traditionally
   been used for these sorts of studies, but they require expert model
   builders to create and maintain abstract business process models of the
   system under study. This can lead to a lack of representativeness and
   difficulty in adapting the model for additional or different study
   scenarios. This paper presents a new simulation approach, Simulation By
   Example, which overcomes these problems by guiding the simulation using
   traces, i.e., examples, of the behavior of the actual system but without
   requiring explicit business process models to be authored. Instead we
   rely on system instrumentation to capture the traces. We demonstrate the
   method in two case studies for healthcare systems as described in recent

Abstract = {{When discussing Arrow's Impossibility Theorem (AIT) in engineering
   design, we find that one condition, Independence of Irrelevant
   Alternatives (IIA), has been misunderstood generally. In this paper, two
   types of IIA are distinguished. One is based on Kenneth Arrow (IIA-A)
   that concerns the rationality condition of a collective choice rule
   (CCR). Another one is based on Amartya Sen (IIA-S) that is a condition
   for a choice function (CF). Through the analysis of this paper revisits
   three decision methods (i.e., Pugh matrix, Borda count and Quality
   Function Deployment) that have been criticized for their failures in
   some situations. It is argued that the violation of IIA-A does not
   immediately imply irrationality in engineering design, and more detailed
   analysis should be applied to examine the meaning of ``irrelevant
   information{''}. Alternatively, IIA-S is concerned with the transitivity
   of CF, and it is associated with contraction consistency (Property
   alpha) and expansion consistency (Property beta). It is shown that IIA-A
   and IIA-S are technically distinct and should not be confused in the
   rationality arguments. Other versions of IIA-A are also introduced to
   emphasize the significance of mathematical clarity in the discussion of
   AIT-related issues.}},

Abstract = {{Software agents with autonomous interaction, negotiation and learning
   capabilities can be considered as a social network. Central problems in
   these social networks are: (1) investigating the network to find hot
   spots (nodes that actively participate in the expansion of the net both
   physically and functionally); (2) detecting violating nodes, i.e. nodes
   that have violated certain network policies. Key difference between
   human and agent based social nets are heterogeneity of agents and having
   various instances for an agent type. In this paper we propose a
   technique that can identify neutral nodes, i.e. nodes that can never be
   considered as a violating or interesting node because it shows similar
   behavior in all of its interactions. Given the communication protocol
   and by extracting communication rules, the neutrality for the agent is
   found in two levels, namely, inter-type and intra-type interactions. The
   neutrality is found in two steps by giving the network topology and
   rules of negotiation among agents, and the communication protocol and
   the extracted communication rules. These two steps guarantee the
   similarity in frequencies and behaviors of the agents. A direct
   advantage of this method is reducing the computational complexity for
   applying analysis techniques and examining all agents to detect a
   certain property. The techniques are verified through a case study in
   online auctions. Two additional application areas which widely use
   agent-based systems are discussed for utilization of the proposed
   method: e-commerce and e-learning.}},

Abstract = {{Clay and shale formations are potentially subjected to swelling and
   softening when they are exposed to fresh water. Conventional swell test
   on clay and shale is very slow and it can take months or years to
   achieve the full swelling potential. This paper proposes the use of an
   electrical potential gradient applied across the clay sample to
   accelerate the swelling process. The fluid flow and ions transport in a
   clayey porous medium under an electrical potential gradient are examined
   along with possible chemical reactions. Details of the experimental
   design, setup, and testing procedures are presented. The test materials
   include reconstituted kalonite and bentonite samples saturated with
   sodium chloride solution and natural shale cores. Results of this study
   confirm that the applied electrical potential gradient enhances the
   ionic depletion and fluid flow, and subsequently the swelling process.}},

Abstract = {{The interactions of K2CO3 with ash-free coal in N-2 or CO2 atmospheres
   were studied at 700 degrees C by thermogravimetry and in situ X-ray
   diffraction. Upon heating in a N-2 atmosphere, K2CO3 influenced the
   pyrolysis of the ash-free coal by reducing the temperature from 320 to
   240 degrees C at which the maximum rate of devolatilization occurred. At
   650 degrees C, the devolatilization of ash-free coal was finished.
   However, ash-free coal mixed with K2CO3 exhibited a further weight
   decrease due to the release of CO from the carbonate while heating in
   N-2 at 700 degrees C. In this step, the potassium catalyst was reduced
   to a -COK and/or -CK surface complex, which might be the active species
   in the catalytic gasification process. In situ X-ray diffraction
   analysis also suggested that K2CO3 does not exist in inert gas (N-2) and
   gasification (CO2) atmospheres at 700 degrees C. At this temperature,
   the evaporation of potassium is negligible. A faster CO2 gasification
   rate was achieved by holding the sample (ash-free coal mixed with K2CO3)
   for 150 min at 700 degrees C in N-2 prior to switching to the reaction
   gas, compared with no holding time. This result indicates that catalyst
   reduction is necessary for a fast char conversion and also shows that
   the reaction gas (i.e., CO2) itself inhibits the reduction process. (C)

Abstract = {{It is not well understood how co-feeding of coal and biomass influences
   the reaction kinetics of gasification and pyrolysis. Co-pyrolysis of
   biomass and fossil fuels is investigated in this paper. After fuel
   characterization, the influences of temperature on the physical and
   chemical properties of char produced from biomass and non-biomass fuels
   were investigated, and the kinetics of atmospheric-pressure pyrolysis in
   a nitrogen environment were determined. The results show that product
   physical properties, such as surface area, depend on the pyrolysis
   temperature. For individual fuels, pine sawdust char prepared at 750
   degrees C had the highest CO2 and N-2 uptake, while switchgrass had very
   low N-2 uptake, but high CO2 uptake. The surface area of the fluid coke
   decreased with increasing temperature, but was almost constant for coal.
   Co-pyrolysis in a thermogravimetric analyzer exhibited three stages.
   Devolatilization of the biomass and coal portions of blended samples
   occurred independently, i.e. without significant synergy. The
   Coats-Redfern method was used to analyze the kinetics of solid fuel
   pyrolysis, indicating that it can be described by multi-step reactions.
   The model was able to identify likely reaction mechanisms and activation
   energies of each pyrolysis stage, giving predictions consistent with the
   experimental results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, convection heat transfer and laminar flow of nanofluids
   with non-Newtonian base fluid in a rectangular microchannel have been
   investigated numerically using two-phase mixture model. This research
   investigates the advantages of using nanoparticles in non-Newtonian
   fluids with particles size equal to 30 nm. The factor that makes
   nanoparticles feasible is the significant increase in rate of heat
   transfer within the fluids that are common in today's industry. The
   power law model is used both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. The
   flow behavior and rate of heat transfer performance of microchannel heat
   sink have been taken into account by looking into the effects of Al2O3
   nanoparticles concentrations, Peclet number and flow behavior index. Our
   results demonstrate significant enhancement of heat transfer of
   non-Newtonian fluids using nanoparticles particularly in the entrance
   region. By increasing the volume fraction, higher heat transfer
   enhancement can be observed. The thermal resistance with Peclet number
   of 700 and 4\% volume fraction reduces approximately 27.2\% with shear
   thinning non-Newtonian base fluid and pressure drop will increase
   approximately 50.7\%. Further analysis on particles type effect is also

Title = {{Effects of Pulsation to the Mean Field and Vortex Development in a
   Backward-Facing Step Flow}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This work is concerned with the behavior of pulsatile flows over a
   backward-facing step geometry. The paper mainly focuses on the effects
   of the pulsation frequency on the vortex development of a 2:1
   backward-facing step for mean Reynolds number of 100 and for 0.035 <= St
   <= 2.19. The dependence of the flow field on the Reynolds number (Re =
   100 and 200) was also examined for a constant Strouhal number, St of 1.
   A literature survey was carried out and it was found that the pulsation
   modifies the behavior of the flow pattern compared to the steady flow.
   It was shown in the present work that the inlet pulsation generally
   leads to differences in the mean flow compared to the steady field
   although the inlet bulk velocity is the same due to energy
   redistribution of the large-scale vortices, which result in nonlinear
   effects. The particle-image velocimetry results show that the formation
   of coherent structures, dynamical shedding, and transport procedure are
   very sensitive to the level of pulsation frequencies. For low and
   moderate inlet frequencies, 0.4 <= St <= 1, strong vortices are formed
   and these vortices are periodically advected downstream in an alternate
   pattern. For very low inlet frequency, St = 0.035, stronger vortices are
   generated due to an extended formation time, however, the slow formation
   process causes the forming vortices to decay before shedding can happen.
   For high inlet frequencies, St >= 2.19, primary vortex is weak while no
   secondary vortex is formed. Flow downstream of the expansion recovers
   quickly. For Re = 200, the pattern of vortex formation is similar to Re
   = 100. However, the primary and secondary vortices decay more slowly and
   the vortices remain stronger for Re = 200. The strength and structure of
   the vortical regions depends highly on St, but Re effects are not
   negligible.}},

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{115}},
Pages = {{534-538}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Low-temperature oxidation (LTO) of Lloydminster heavy oil samples was
   investigated for a basic understanding of the reaction kinetics and an
   estimation of the product sequence. Ramped temperature oxidation
   experiments and isothermal experiments at seven different temperatures
   from 50 to 350 degrees C were performed to observe the thermal oxidation
   behavior of this heavy oil and to find kinetic parameters of the
   oxidation during LTO. The results reveal that there were four different
   subzones within the LTO zone. This is similar to previous findings for
   an Alaska heavy oil. The first and third subzones had positive
   activation energies, whereas the second and fourth subzones had negative
   activation energies. Compared to the sample from Alaska, the
   Lloydminster heavy oil exhibited higher derivative weight loss values, a
   higher order of reaction and lower activation energy. From each
   isothermal experiment, an elemental analysis conducted on the residue
   suggested that aldehyde is a major LTO product in the first subzone;
   alcohols and ketones are the major products in the second subzone;
   hydroperoxide and carboxylic acids dominate the third subzone; and,
   ketones and hydroperoxide are the major products of the fourth subzone.

Title = {{Energy efficiency and emissions intensity of SAGD}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{115}},
Pages = {{706-713}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Currently, to mobilize and produce bitumen from Athabasca oil sands
   reservoirs, Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) is the method of
   choice. SAGD, requires large amounts of energy and emits significant
   volumes of greenhouse gases to the environment. Here, we discuss the
   thermal efficiencies, energy balances, and emissions of SAGD. While the
   world's heavy oil and oil sand resource is large, average recoveries
   from heavy oil and oil sand reservoirs are typically low, ranging from
   5\% to 15\% for cold heavy oil production and from 25\% to 60\% percent
   for steam-based in situ processes. This is for two reasons: firstly,
   geological heterogeneity and secondly, ubiquitous large scale fluid
   property heterogeneities are common on a range of spatial scales. Thus,
   there is a strong motivation to develop better recovery processes with
   lower energy and emission intensities. The thermal efficiencies, energy
   balances, and emissions of SAGD show a very wide range of field
   performance for the current thermal recovery projects in Alberta, with
   earlier pilots being more successful. The data suggests that at the
   extreme, some operations are actually not net energy generating with
   injected energy via steam, exceeding recovered chemical energy in
   recovered oil. Differential pricing of oil and natural gas, the main
   steam generating fuel, still permits these extreme cases to be
   economically profitable due to low natural gas prices. In all cases,
   carbon dioxide intensity is high. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this work, electrochemical corrosion of X65 carbon steel under
   deoxygenated water drop and sand deposit simulating the corrosive
   environments potentially developed in diluted bitumen transmission
   pipelines was investigated by various electrochemical measurements and a
   localized electrochemical impedance spectroscopy technique. In the
   absence of oxygen, corrosion of steel under water drop occurs uniformly
   on the whole electrode surface at a quite low corrosion rate. This is
   attributed to formation of corrosion product such as ferrous hydroxide,
   which ``passivate{''} the steel in the water drop. However, corrosion
   pits can be initiated under sand deposit. Mechanistically, the sands
   block transport of corrosion product into the bulk solution, causing the
   corrosion product to deposit. A galvanic effect is generated, where the
   edge of the corrosion product ring serves as an anode and the
   product-covered steel matrix as a cathode. The high electrochemical
   activity at the edge of the ring enhances preferential dissolution
   locally, resulting in formation of corrosion pits. (C) 2013 Elsevier

   unavoidable even under the `tight focusing'. Both theoretic analysis and
   experimental result indicate that convergent defocusing is a better
   option for some micro-machining purposes. The optimal defocusing

Abstract = {{This paper presents a finite-element (FE) model for simulating injection
   well testing in unconsolidated oil sands reservoir. In injection well
   testing, the bottom-hole pressure (BHP) is monitored during the
   injection and shut-in period. The flow characteristics of a reservoir
   can be determined from transient BHP data using conventional reservoir
   or well-testing analysis. However, conventional reservoir or
   well-testing analysis does not consider geomechanics coupling effects.
   This simplified assumption has limitations when applied to
   unconsolidated (uncemented) oil sands reservoirs because oil sands
   deform and dilate subjected to pressure variation. In addition,
   hydraulic fracturing may occur in unconsolidated oil sands when high
   water injection rate is used. This research is motivated in numerical
   modeling of injection well testing in unconsolidated oil sands reservoir
   considering the geomechanics coupling effects including hydraulic
   fracturing. To simulate the strong anisotropy in mechanical and
   hydraulic behaviour of unconsolidated oil sands induced by fluid
   injection in injection well testing, a nonlinear stress-dependent
   poro-elasto-plastic constitutive model together with a strain-induced
   anisotropic permeability model are formulated and implemented into a 3D
   FE simulator. The 3D FE model is used to history match the BHP response
   measured from an injection well in an oil sands reservoir. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{We propose the application of a back flow cell model for the simulation
   of supercritical CO2 dissolution in water in static mixers at pressures
   and temperatures pertinent to geological CO2 storage. Using step tracer
   injection experiments, the required parameters for calibration of the
   back flow cell model, such as the number of the cells and the back flow
   ratio, were obtained. The calibrated model was then verified with the
   experimental mass transfer measurements at supercritical conditions, and
   an acceptable agreement was observed. Experimental data of CO2
   dissolution in water were regenerated with an average absolute relative
   deviation of less than 5\%. Using the developed model, the optimal
   operating conditions were determined. The developed model will be useful
   for the engineering design of CO2 dissolution systems and simulation of
   supercritical CO2 dissolution in water for geological CO2 storage. (C)

Title = {{In Situ Raman Studies of Carbon Removal from High Temperature Ni-YSZ
   Cermet Anodes by Gas Phase Reforming Agents}},

Abstract = {{In situ vibrational Raman scattering has been employed to examine rates
   of carbon formation and removal from Ni/YSZ cermet anodes in
   functioning, electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).
   Specifically, Raman scattering characterized the ability of different
   gas phase species commonly used as reforming agents to remove carbon
   that had accumulated on Ni/YSZ cermet anodes at 730 degrees C. Anodes
   held at open circuit voltage (OCV) were exposed first to a dry methane
   feed and then to an inert carrier gas containing either H2O(g), CO2, or
   O-2. Carbon deposits began to form within 5 s of methane exposure.
   Vibrational Raman spectra showed that the carbon deposits consisted of
   highly ordered graphite as evidenced by a single pronounced feature in
   the spectra at 1556 cm(-1). Changing the incident gas phase environment
   over the anode to Ar containing either H2O (2\%), CO2 (6\%), or O-2
   (6\%) led to quantitative removal of the carbon and partial or complete
   oxidation of the Ni as evidenced by the growth of a NiO vibrational band
   (at 1080 cm(-1)) in. the Raman spectra. Carbon removal rates from the
   Ni/YSZ anode were fastest with vapor phase H2O, then O-2, and finally
   slowest with CO2. The extent of Ni oxidation was much more pronounced
   with O-2 than with either H2O or CO2. These chemical processes observed
   directly in the Raman spectra were reflected in the device's open
   circuit voltage (OCV). Correlating findings from these two methods-in
   situ Raman spectroscopy and voltage measurements-provided a direct
   connection between the chemical composition of SOFC anodes and the
   electrochemical condition of the device. These results inspire
   confidence that any of the reforming agents used-H2O, O-2, and CO2-will
   remove carbon from Ni anodes quantitatively on a time scale of similar
   to 10 to similar to 125 s. However, H2O and CO2 appear less likely to
   damage the cell following carbon removal, as H2O and CO2 do not
   quantitatively oxidize the Ni in the cermet anode. In contrast, exposure
   to O-2 leads to much more extensive Ni oxidation and an OCV that
   approaches 0.0 V, implying that the Ni/NiO equilibrium sustained by H2O
   and CO2 is driven completely to NiO by O-2.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an effort-reduced approach for calibrating the
   reconfigurable six-port based receiver (SPR) systems for cognitive
   radio/software defined radio applications that accounts for all the
   known imperfections and impairments of an SPR system. The
   state-of-the-art calibration method requires estimation of more than 100
   calibration parameters on-the-fly. The proposed calibration method
   reduces the number of parameters to four without any sacrifice in the
   overall system performance. The proposed method uses a different
   structure for six-port junction to ease the calibration effort. The
   nonlinearity and the frequency response of the system are broken down
   into two different realms. Nonlinearity of the system is accounted for
   by continuous wave characterization of the diode detectors while the
   frequency response is compensated for using an equalizer in the
   calibration step. The results obtained for the proposed approach are
   compared with the state-of-the-art calibration method. Similar
   performance from the SPR system is obtained with much reduced
   calibration complexity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new linearization algorithm, discrete level gain
   adjustment (DLGA), for linearized high efficiency multi-level delta
   sigma modulator(Delta Sigma M) -based transmitter architectures adequate
   for wideband multi-standard software defined radio (SDR) applications.
   The new simple linearization DLGA algorithm is deployed instead of using
   a full digitally predistorted to maintain the linearity of the employed
   switching-mode power amplifier (SMPA) with a considerable decrease in
   the complexity of the digital signal processing (DSP) unit. The proposed
   architecture includes a multi-level envelope Delta Sigma M(E Delta Sigma
   M) concurrently with a linearized SMPA, in order to achieve a better
   trade-off of power efficiency versus linearity. Based on DLGA, instead
   of envelope elimination and restoration (EER) configuration, three-level
   envelope LP Delta Sigma M-based transmitter in phase elimination and
   restoration (PER) configuration was implemented. The bandwidth
   constraint of the EER configuration was relaxed. First, a multi-level
   Envelope E Delta Sigma M-based transmitter was studied to determine the
   optimal number of quantizer levels that could be used. Through MATLAB
   simulation and measurement results, it was shown that the best
   performance was achieved with a discrete level signal that has three
   different power levels, including zero and regardless the phase. From
   the measurements, the linearized three-level PER-LPE Delta Sigma M
   transmitter shows an efficiency of 36\%, signal-to-noise distortion
   ratio of 43.8 dB and adjacent channel power ratio of 45 dB.}},

Abstract = {{Space-time spectral white spaces in a cognitive radio environment are
   defined based on multidimensional spatio-temporal spectral properties of
   radio waves received by a planar array of antennas. Spectral occupancy
   of a given carrier frequency pertaining to a particular direction in
   space is expressed by the volume of a semi-cone shaped geometrical
   region in the 3-D spatio-temporal frequency space omega. A combined
   approach employing low complexity array processing and conventional
   time-frequency spectrum sensing is proposed towards the detection of
   space-time white spaces in omega. The detection scheme employs four
   subsystems; antenna array, front-end processing, 3-D spatio-temporal
   array processing, and 1-D spectrum sensing. Key components in the
   antenna array and front-end processing subsystems are described
   including an example of a broadband Vivaldi antenna simulated in the
   frequency range 1.25-2 GHz. The array processing subsystem employs 3-D
   infinite impulse response digital beam filters, as a low complexity
   alternative to conventional phased arrays. One potential realization of
   the 1-D spectrum sensing subsystem is described by using a tunable
   bandpass filter followed by an energy detector. Simulation examples are
   provided by considering different directions of arrival, effect of
   multi-path replicas, signal to noise ratio changes and both narrow band
   and wideband signals in the normalized temporal frequency range (0, pi).}},

Title = {{A fast and effective method to evaluate the polymer flooding potential

Abstract = {{Laboratory polymer flooding tests conducted in sandpacks show great
   potential for improving heavy oil recovery. The high price of crude oil
   and wide application of horizontal wells make polymer flooding both
   economically affordable and technically feasible for heavy oil
   reservoirs. Field applications of polymer flooding in heavy oil
   reservoirs are currently being pursued. As polymer injection involves
   great investment, laboratory evaluations are essential prior to the
   field-scale application. However, due to high oil viscosities, large
   volumes of fluids have to be injected into sandpacks or reservoir cores
   in order to reach reasonable recoveries, which is a time-consuming
   process.
   This study establishes a fast and effective method to examine the
   potential of enhanced heavy oil recovery by polymer flooding.
   Experimental results of sandpack polymer flooding tests, for heavy oil
   samples with different viscosities, are analyzed. For each heavy oil
   sample, the polymer viscosity-sensitive range, within which tertiary
   recovery increases dramatically with increasing polymer viscosity, is
   different To facilitate the evaluation of polymer flooding potential for
   heavy oils with various viscosities, the oil-water mobility ratio at the
   end of initial waterflooding is chosen as a normalization factor. Using
   normalization, an identical oil-water mobility ratio-sensitive range can
   be obtained for heavy oils with different viscosities. Based on the
   normalized relationship, the potential of enhanced heavy oil recovery by
   polymer injection can be quickly and effectively evaluated. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{A laboratory-based closure study was completed to compare measured and
   modeled optical properties and their dependence on controlled relative
   humidity (RH) for inorganic salts, dicarboxylic acids, and their
   mixtures. The closure between measured and modeled values of the light
   scattering coefficients were evaluated by calculating the average
   relative difference CARD) values, which revealed agreement within 8.0\%
   for the total scattering (sigma(sp)) and 14.8\% for the back scattering
   (sigma(bsp)) values at dry RH conditions for all test aerosols. These
   ARID values were less than the total relative uncertainty based on the
   measurement and modeling approaches, indicating the achievement of
   closure for sigma(sp) and sigma(bsp) Optical properties derived from
   sigma(sp) including: (1) the hygroscopic growth factor, f sigma(sp), (2)
   the backscatter ratio, b, and (3) the Angstrom exponent, (\$) over
   circle, were also compared with measured values. The ARD values between
   corresponding measured and modeled results for these derived optical
   parameters ranged from 0.1\% to 30.8\%. The impact of particulate
   organic matter (POM) on optical and hygroscopic properties of the
   aerosols tested here was also compared to the aerosol optical and
   composition measurements that occurred during the New England Air
   Quality Study-Intercontinental Transport and Chemical Transformation
   field campaign. Such comparison confirmed that a larger POM mass
   fraction resulted in less hygroscopicity for both the ambient and the
   laboratory aerosols. This study evaluated closure between laboratory
   measurements and model calculations and validated the reliability of the
   measured and modeled results with the closure analysis. Therefore,
   Mie-Lorentz model can be used to calculate the optical properties and
   their dependence on RH for other aerosols with more confidence. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{High asphaltene content in heavy crude oil normally generates adverse
   rheological properties that affect the flow through the reservoir,
   preventing optimal hydrocarbon production. It has been demonstrated that
   using nanoparticles may improve the mobility of oil. Nanoparticles may
   be used as adsorbents and catalysts in the oil industry for in situ
   upgrading. The main objective of this study was to investigate the
   sorption kinetics and the thermodynamic equilibrium for asphaltene
   sorption onto nickel and/or palladium oxides supported on fumed silica
   that was nanoparticulated at different times, temperatures, and
   concentrations. After adsorption, thermally cracked asphaltenes from
   Colombian crude oil were investigated using catalytic oxidation. The
   asphaltenes adsorbed onto the selected nanoparticles were subjected to
   thermal decomposition up to 700 degrees C in a thermogravimetric
   analyzer. This study was realized using an experimental design with a
   measured simplex-centroid of the three components by varying the wt \%
   of the palladium and nickel oxides as well as the fumed silica as the
   support. The silica nanoparticles were characterized using N-2
   adsorption at 196 degrees C and X-ray diffraction. The Langmuir and
   Freundlich models were used to correlate the experimental sorption
   equilibrium data. The experimental asphaltene adsorption isotherm data
   were adequately adjusted using the Freundlich model. The adsorption of
   asphaltenes on NiO and/or PdO supported on fumed silica was much higher
   than that over fumed silica over the range of the tested equilibrium
   concentrations. Pseudo-first- and pseudo-second-order kinetic models
   were applied to the experimental data obtained at different asphaltene
   concentrations from 100 to 1500 mg/L for the virgin fumed silica (S) and
   fumed silica-supported materials (SHSs); better fits were found for the
   pseudo-second-order model. However, the nanoparticles significantly
   decreased the asphaltene decomposition temperature and activation
   energy. The catalyst kinetics was calculated using the Ozawa-Flynn-Wall
   Model (OFW). All of the nanoparticles demonstrated high catalytic
   activity toward asphaltene decomposition in the following order at 0.2
   mg/m(2) asphaltene concentration on nanoparticle surfaces: SNi1 <
   SNi1Pd1 < SNi0.66Pd0.66 < SPd1 < SPd2 < SNi2 < S. Consequently, using
   nanoparticles significantly enhanced the thermal decomposition of
   asphaltenes, improving the mobility of heavy oils in situ.}},

Abstract = {{The study described here tested the hypothesis that early
   intra-articular inflammation is associated with the development of
   post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) in a sheep model. We extended
   previously published work in which we investigated joint gross
   morphology and synovial mRNA expression of inflammatory and catabolic
   molecules 2 weeks after anatomic Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)
   autograft reconstructive surgery (ACL-R). The same variables have been
   analyzed at 20 weeks post surgery together with new experimental
   variables at both time points. Animals were sacrificed at 20 weeks post
   ACL-R surgery and their joints graded for signs of PTOA. Synovial
   samples were harvested for histological grading plus mRNA and protein
   analysis for a panel of inflammatory and catabolic molecules. The mRNA
   expression levels for this panel plus connective tissue matrix turnover
   molecules were also investigated in cartilage samples. Results of gross
   morphological assessments at 20 weeks post surgery showed some changes
   consistent with early OA, but indicated little progression of damage
   from the 2 week time point. While significant alterations in mRNA levels
   for synovial inflammatory and catabolic molecules were detected at 2
   weeks, values had normalized by 20 weeks. Similarly, all mRNA expression
   levels for inflammatory and catabolic molecules in articular cartilage
   had returned to normal levels by 20 weeks post ACL-R surgery. We
   conclude that synovial inflammatory processes are initiated very early
   after ACL-R surgery and may instigate events that lead to the gross
   cartilage and joint abnormalities observed as early as 2 weeks. However,
   the absence of sustained inflammation and joint instability may prevent
   OA progression. (C) 2013 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.

Abstract = {{Steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) is the preferred method to
   extract bitumen from Athabasca oil-sand reservoirs in western Canada. In
   SAGD, steam, injected outward from a horizontal injection well, loses
   its latent heat when it contacts the cold bitumen at the edge of a steam
   chamber. Consequently, the viscosity of the bitumen falls several orders
   of magnitude, enabling it to flow under gravity toward a horizontal
   production well directly below to the injection well. It is commonly
   believed that conduction is the dominant heat-transfer mechanism at the
   edge of the chamber. Heat transfer by convection is not considered in
   classic SAGD mathematical models such as the one derived by Butler.
   Researchers such as Butler and Stephens (1981), Reis (1992), Akin
   (2005), Liang (2005), Nukhaev et al. (2006), and Azad and Chalaturnyk
   (2010) considered the conduction from steam to cold reservoir to be the
   only heat-transfer component. Farouq-Ali (1997), Edmunds (1999a, b), Ito
   and Suzuki (1996, 1999), Ito et al. (1998), Sharma and Gates (2011), and
   Irani and Ghannadi (2013) questioned the assumption that thermal
   conduction dominates heat transfer at the edge of a SAGD chamber. Sharma
   and Gates (2011) and Irani and Ghannadi (2013) studied convective flux
   from condensate flow at the edge of an SAGD steam chamber. Irani and
   Ghannadi (2013) derived a new formulation that solves the energy balance
   and pressure-driven condensate flow normal to the steam-chamber
   interface into the cold bitumen reservoir and concluded that the
   assumption of conduction-dominated heat transfer is valid; however, all
   previous analyses do not include convective heat transfer arising from
   draining bitumen and condensate. Although a few researchers have studied
   convective flux from condensate flow at the edge of an SAGD steam
   chamber (e.g., Sharma and Gates 2011; Irani and Ghannadi 2013), there is
   a lack of understanding of bitumen and condensate drainage parallel to
   the edge of the chamber and of its effect on transverse heat transfer
   into the oil sand beyond the chamber. In this study, the relative roles
   of convective heat flux both parallel and normal to the edge of a steam
   chamber are examined. The results suggest that the convective heat flux
   associated with flow parallel to the chamber edge is minor compared with
   that normal to the edge.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of varying operating parameters on the degradation of a
   single-cell direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) with serpentine flow
   channels was investigated. Fuel cell internal temperature, methanol
   concentration, and air and methanol flow rates were varied in
   experimental tests and fuel cell performance was chronologically
   recorded. A DMFC semi-empirical performance model was developed to
   predict the polarization curves of the DMFC and validated at different
   operating conditions. Performance degradation was observed and modeled
   over time by a linear regression model. Unlike previous studies, the
   cumulative exposure of the operating factors to the fuel cell was
   considered in the degradation analysis. The degradation model shows the
   cell voltage generation capacity does not significantly degrade.
   However, the Tafel slope of the cell changes with cumulative exposure to
   methanol concentration and air flow, and the ohmic resistance changes
   with cumulative exposure to temperature, methanol and air flow.}},

Abstract = {{Power amplifiers are widely used in RF broadcasting applications.
   However, they tend to exhibit nonlinear behavior that distorts the input
   signals both in the time and frequency domains, consequently motivating
   the development of techniques, such as digital predistortion, which can
   counteract this behavior. Among the challenges facing the identification
   of an amplifier's digital predistorter and behavioral model is finding
   the correct model dimensions, as this requires a priori knowledge of
   multiple parameters. In this paper, a predistorter based on a
   cluster-based implementation particle swarm optimization technique with
   embedded model-size estimation capability is presented. The validation
   of the proposed technique on a Doherty power amplifier prototype
   demonstrates its ability to efficiently find the dimensions of a memory
   polynomial based digital predistorter, while accurately estimating its
   coefficients.}},

Abstract = {{The conventional determination of pulmonary vascular resistance does not
   indicate which vascular segments contribute to the total resistance of
   the pulmonary circulation. Using measurements of pressure and flow, the
   reservoir-wave model can be used to partition total pulmonary vascular
   resistance into arterial, microcirculation, and venous components.
   Changes to these resistance components are investigated during hypoxia
   and inhaled nitric oxide, volume loading, and positive end-expiratory
   pressure. The reservoir-wave model defines the pressure of a
   volume-related reservoir and the asymptotic pressure. The mean values of
   arterial and venous reservoir pressures and arterial and venous
   asymptotic pressures define a series of resistances between the main
   pulmonary artery and the pulmonary veins: the resistance of large and
   small arteries, the microcirculation, and veins. In 11 anaesthetized,
   openchest dogs, pressure and flow were measured in the main pulmonary
   artery and a single pulmonary vein. Volume loading reduced each vascular
   resistance component, whereas positive end-expiratory pressure only
   increased microcirculation resistance. Hypoxia increased the resistance
   of small arteries and veins, whereas nitric oxide only decreased
   small-artery resistance significantly. The reservoir-wave model provides
   a novel method to deconstruct total pulmonary vascular resistance. The
   results are consistent with the expected physiological responses of the
   pulmonary circulation and provide additional information regarding which
   segments of the pulmonary circulation react to hypoxia and nitric oxide.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces two new techniques to enhance both efficiency and
   signal bandwidth in delta-sigma-based transmitters. At first step, a
   technique called quantization noise reduction (QNR), is introduced to
   enhance the coding efficiency. By filtering out part of the quantization
   noise in the whole band of the signal, while the signal envelope is
   maintained almost constant, the coding efficiency is improved without
   imposing any additional nonlinearity or distortion to the system. By
   utilizing this technique for an orthogonal frequency division
   multiplexing (OFDM) signal with 1.25-MHz bandwidth and 80 times
   oversampling, with 8.1-dB peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), the coding
   efficiency is improved from 8.8\% to 14.5\% while the signal-to-noise
   distortion ratio (SNDR) of the system remains 43 dB. In the next step by
   using a controlled filtering on in-band quantization noise along with
   QNR technique, the bandwidth of the signal and efficiency are increased
   simultaneously without losing as much linearity. The second technique is
   called quantization noise reduction with in-band filtering or (QNRIF).
   QNRIF is applied on an OFDM signal with 1.25-MHz bandwidth, with the
   same PAPR and only 16 times oversampling. The result for the coding
   efficiency is improved from 7.7\% to 18.7\% with 41-dB SNDR.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel concurrent dual-band receiver architecture
   that uses only one six-port correlator circuit to downconvert two
   signals in two different bands concurrently. The receiver is
   reconfigurable over a broadband to simultaneously receive two different
   signals with different modulation techniques and bandwidths. There are
   no limitations on the carrier frequencies of the two signals except that
   they have to be within the bandwidth of the six port receiver. The
   mathematical model for the receiver is derived and subsequently
   implemented to evaluate its performance. This approach shows that, by
   analytically choosing the frequencies of the two local oscillator
   signals sent into the six-port correlator, the in-phase (I) and the
   quadrature (Q) components of each of the two input RF signals can be
   obtained from the filtered high-pass and low-pass components of the
   diode detectors outputs. A black box model, which uses a modified memory
   polynomial, is used to calibrate the receiver. The calibration constants
   are estimated by sending a training signal of similar characteristics as
   the signal to be received. Two signals pairs with different modulation
   types are received to verify the model, and to evaluate the performance
   and test the robustness of the receiver. A 64-QAM signal at 2.5 GHz and
   a 16-QAM signal at 3.0 GHz, both with a data rate of 2 Mbps are
   received. The measured EVMs were 1.9\% for the 64-QAM and 1.8\% for the
   16-QAM. Real communication signals, WCDMA and LTE were also received
   concurrently with measured EVMs of 1.9\% and 2.0\%, respectively. A bit
   error rate (BER) profile of the receiver for a 16QAM and 64QAM, both at
   2Mbps is also plotted to evaluate the receiver.}},

Abstract = {{The behavior of power amplifiers (PAs) driven by concurrent dual-band
   signals is analyzed theoretically in this paper. According to the
   analysis, the impedance matching at intermodulation (IM) frequency is
   very important for PAs working in concurrent mode. Based on the concept
   of IM impedance tuning, a family of new operation modes can be
   introduced, including concurrent Class-A, Class-AB, Class-B, and
   Class-C. The theoretical performance of these modes are derived and the
   overdrive effects of them are also discussed. A possible structure is
   proposed to implement the proposed IM impedance tuning, and a concurrent
   Class-AB dual-band example PA operating at 1.9-2.6-GHz long-term
   evolution (LTE) bands is demonstrated. Experimental results show good
   consistence with the theoretical analysis, and the concurrent Class-AB
   PA prototype exhibits higher than 36.1\% power-added efficiency in
   concurrent mode when driven by 10- and 15-MHz LTE signals in two bands
   concurrently. To our best knowledge, this is the state-of-the-art
   efficiency performance of concurrent dual-band PAs, even higher than
   previously reported dual-band Doherty PAs. Additionally the proposed PA,
   which is fabricated using a 10-W GaN HEMT, can output more than 34.3-dBm
   power with a peak-to-average ratio of 7 dB in concurrent mode, showing a
   remarkable power utilization factor for concurrent dual-band PAs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a novel digital predistortion (DPD) scheme for
   concurrent tri-band power amplifiers (PAs). The proposed tri-band DPD is
   based on a pruned Volterra model that takes into account the impact of
   the phase distortion observed in multi-band PAs as well as the compound
   amplitude distortion. By taking into account the phase variation effects
   across a wide frequency band, the proposed 3-D phase-aligned Volterra
   DPD can effectively compensate for the crosstalk effects between the
   fundamental frequencies, their harmonics, and intermodulation products
   due to the nonlinearity the tri-band PA exhibited. The performance of
   the proposed DPD is validated using a broadband Class-AB PA driven
   concurrently by three independent carrier-aggregated long-term evolution
   signals at separation frequencies around 100 MHz. The measurement
   results validate the accurate performance of the proposed 3-D
   phase-aligned pruned Volterra DPD in suppressing the in-band and

Abstract = {{An area efficient row-parallel architecture is proposed for the
   real-time implementation of bivariate algebraic integer (AI) encoded 2-D
   discrete cosine transform (DCT) for image and video processing. The
   proposed architecture computes 8x8 2-D DCT transform based on the Arai
   DCT algorithm. An improved fast algorithm for AI-based 1-D DCT
   computation is proposed along with a single channel 2-D DCT
   architecture. The design improves on the four-channel AI DCT
   architecture that was published recently by reducing the number of
   integer channels to one and the number of eight-point 1-D DCT cores from
   five down to two. The architecture offers exact computation of 8x8
   blocks of the 2-D DCT coefficients up to the FRS, which converts the
   coefficients from the AI representation to fixed-point format using the
   method of expansion factors. Prototype circuits corresponding to FRS
   blocks based on two expansion factors are realized, tested, and verified
   on FPGA-chip, using a Xilinx Virtex-6 XC6VLX240T device. Post
   place-and-route results show a 20\% reduction in terms of area compared
   to the 2-D DCT architecture requiring five 1-D AI cores. The area-time
   and area-time2 complexity metrics are also reduced by 23\% and 22\%
   respectively for designs with eight-bit input word length. The digital
   realizations are simulated up to place and route for ASICs using 45 nm
   CMOS standard cells. The maximum estimated clock rate is 951 MHz for the
   CMOS realizations indicating 7.608 . 10(9) pixels/s and a 8x8 block rate
   of 118.875 MHz.}},

Title = {{A Patch-based Cellular Automaton for Simulating Land-use Changes at Fine

Abstract = {{While cellular automata have become popular tools for modeling land-use
   changes, there is a lack of studies reporting their application at very
   fine spatial resolutions (e.g. 5m resolution). Traditional cell-based CA
   do not generate reliable results at such resolutions because single
   cells might only represent components of land-use entities (i.e. houses
   or parks in urban residential areas), while recently proposed
   entity-based CA models usually ignore the internal heterogeneity of the
   entities. This article describes a patch-based CA model designed to deal
   with this problem by integrating cell and object concepts. A patch is
   defined as a collection of adjacent cells that might have different
   attributes, but that represent a single land-use entity. In this model,
   a transition probability map was calculated at each cell location for
   each land-use transition using a weight of evidence method; then,
   land-use changes were simulated by employing a patch-based procedure
   based on the probability maps. This CA model, along with a traditional
   cell-based model were tested in the eastern part of the Elbow River
   watershed in southern Alberta, Canada, an area that is under
   considerable pressure for land development due to its proximity to the
   fast growing city of Calgary. The simulation results for the two models
   were compared to historical data using visual comparison, K-simulation
   indices, and landscape metrics. The results reveal that the patch-based
   CA model generates more compact and realistic land-use patterns than the
   traditional cell-based CA. The K-simulation values indicate that the
   land-use maps obtained with the patch-based CA are in higher agreement
   with the historical data than those created by the cell-based model,
   particularly regarding the location of change. The landscape metrics
   reveal that the patch-based model is able to adequately capture the
   land-use dynamics as observed in the historical data, while the
   cell-based CA is not able to provide a similar interpretation. The
   patch-based approach proposed in this study appears to be a simple and
   valuable solution to take into account the internal heterogeneity of
   land-use classes at fine spatial resolutions and simulate their
   transitions over time.}},

Abstract = {{Batch experiments were carried out on anaerobic digestion of swine
   manure under 10 \% of total solids and 60 g/L of zeolite addition at 35
   A degrees C. Four distinctive volatile fatty acid (VFAs) evolution
   stages were observed during the anaerobic process, i.e., VFA
   accumulation, acetic acid (HAc) and butyric acid (HBu) utilization,
   propionic acid (HPr) and valeric acid (HVa) degradation, and VFA
   depletion. Large decreases in HAc/HBu and HPr/HVa occurred respectively
   at the first and second biogas peaks. Biogas yield increased by 20 \%
   after zeolite addition, about 356 mL/g VSadded with accelerated soluble
   chemical oxygen demand degradation and VFA (especially HPr and HBu)
   consumption in addition to a shortened lag phase between the two biogas
   peaks. Compared with Ca2+ and Mg2+ (100-300 mg/L) released from zeolite,
   simultaneous K+ and NH4 (+) (580-600 mg/L) adsorptions onto zeolite
   particles contributed more to the enhanced biogasification, resulting in
   alleviated inhibition effects of ammonium on acidogenesis and
   methanogenesis, respectively. All the identified anaerobes could be
   grouped into Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, and zeolite addition had no
   significant influence on the microbial biodiversity in this study.}},

Abstract = {{An investigation into redistribution of vorticity for rapidly
   accelerating plates with varying kinematics and initial conditions has
   been performed. Both three-dimensional particle tracking velocimetry and
   direct force measurements were applied simultaneously. The effective
   velocity of the feeding shear layer has been identified as the
   appropriate characteristic velocity rather than the commonly used plunge
   or free stream velocity. Based on this new normalization for
   circulation, it has been demonstrated that the existence of initial
   boundary-layer vorticity on the plunging plate - at least in the
   near-midplane region - does not contribute to the eventual vortex
   formation process. In accordance with the literature, however, the tip
   vortex positioning relative to the plate surface has been identified as
   an important contributor in the overall force production, particularly
   once the plate acceleration has ceased.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We experimentally investigate the three-dimensional wake behind a finite
   wall-mounted square cylinder at Re = 12 000 and aspect ratio of 4. Focus
   is placed on the base flow and oscillatory fluctuation. Time-resolved
   three-dimensional velocity fields are constructed from high-frame-rate
   particle image velocimetry (PIV) and simultaneously recorded surface
   pressure measurements. All three velocity components are resolved in a
   rectangular near-wake region by two orthogonal dense arrays of parallel
   PIV planes. A key enabler is a generalized phase average incorporating a
   slowly varying base flow, a variable oscillation amplitude and higher
   harmonics. These generalizations reduce the instantaneous residual 30\%
   below those of a traditional phase average. Moreover, the resolved
   variations reveal analytical constraints of the mean flow and
   oscillation levels, such as the mean-field paraboloid. The proposed
   methodology for generalized phase averaging and for construction of
   three-dimensional velocity fields from two-dimensional PIV data is
   applicable to a large class of turbulent flows with oscillatory
   dynamics.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIPHASE FLOW}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{78-87}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Naturally fractured reservoirs contain about 25-30\% of the world supply
   of oil. In these reservoirs, fractures are the dominant flow path.
   Therefore, a good understanding of transfer parameters such as relative
   permeability as well as flow regimes occurring in a fracture plays an
   important role in developing and improving oil production from such
   complex systems. However, in contrast with gas-liquid flow in a single
   fracture, the flow of heavy oil and water has received less attention.
   In this research, a Hele-Shaw apparatus was built to study the flow of
   water in presence of heavy oil and display different flow patterns under
   different flow rates and analyze the effect of fracture orientations on
   relative permeability curves as well as flow regimes. The phase flow
   rates versus phase saturation results were converted to experimental
   relative permeability curves. The results of the experiments demonstrate
   that, depending on fracture and flow orientation, there could be a
   significant interference between the phases flowing through the
   fracture. The results also reveal that both phases can flow in both
   continuous and discontinuous forms. The relative permeability curves
   show that the oil-water relative permeability not only depends on fluid
   saturations and flow patterns but also fracture orientation. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{A designed pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) apparatus has been used to
   measure the (vapor + liquid) equilibrium properties of three binary
   mixtures (methane +, ethane +, and carbon dioxide + 1-butanol) at two
   temperatures (303 and 323) K and at the pressures up to 6 MPa. The
   solubility of the compressed gases in 1-butanol and the saturated liquid
   densities and viscosities were measured. In addition, the density and
   viscosity of pure 1-butanol were measured at two temperatures (303 and
   323) K and at the pressures up to 10 MPa. The experimental results show
   that the solubility of the gases in 1-butanol increases with pressure
   and decreases with temperature. The dissolution of gases in 1-butanol
   causes a decline in the viscosity of liquid phase. The saturated liquid
   density follows a decreasing trend with the solubility of methane and
   ethane. However, the dissolution of carbon dioxide in 1-butanol leads to
   an increase in the density of liquid phase. The experimental data are
   well correlated with Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) and Peng-Robinson (PR)
   equations of state (EOSs). SRK EOS was slightly superior for correlating
   the saturated liquid densities. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Electrically conductive polymer nanocomposite of high density
   polyethylene (HDPE) filled with carbon nanofibers (CNFs) were prepared
   by melt compounding in a batch mixer. The nanocomposite processing
   behavior was studied by monitoring the mixing torque vs. time as
   function of filler content. Scanning electron microscopy and optical
   microscopy were used to investigate the nanocomposite dispersion of
   nanofiller and the adhesion between the nanofiller and polymer matrix.
   The electrical and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding
   behaviors of the nanocomposite were reported as function of nanofibers
   concentration, and an empirical correlation related the EMI SE to the
   nanocomposite's electrical resistivity was developed. Good level of CNF
   dispersion was evident despite the poor adhesion exhibited between the
   nanofibers and the HDPE matrix. At 1.5 vol\% CNF loading, the
   nanocomposite exhibited an electrical volume resistivity of 10(5)
   Omega.cm. EMI shielding effectiveness was found to increase with
   increase in nanofiller concentration. In the 0.1-1.5 GHz frequency
   range, 2 mm thick plate made of 5 vol\% CNF/HDPE nanocomposite exhibits
   an EMI shielding effectiveness of 20 dB. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{FLUID PHASE EQUILIBRIA}},

Abstract = {{A global optimization algorithm was developed for finding all singular
   points (minima, maxima and saddles) of an objective function by
   exploring the natural connectedness that exists between their singular
   points. The idea of following ridges and valleys using information
   gathered along the way was significantly enhanced by applying the arc
   length continuation method. The algorithm was applied to the Gibbs
   tangent plane stability test for multiphase liquid mixtures. The global
   optimization algorithm gives an efficient and robust scheme for locating
   all stationary points of the tangent plane distance function predicted
   by any thermodynamic model. Since it provides very good initial
   estimates for the liquid-liquid equilibrium calculations, it became an
   integral part of a combined phase equilibrium and stability algorithm.
   The combined algorithm is self-starting and significantly improves
   reliability and robustness of multiphase equilibrium calculations. It
   was successfully tested on a variety of problems and is applicable to
   any component's mixtures and any number of liquid phases. Solutions have
   been found for the entire phase diagram. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{A spatial web/agent-based model to support stakeholders' negotiation
   regarding land development}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{129}},
Pages = {{309-323}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Decision making in land management can be greatly enhanced if the
   perspectives of concerned stakeholders are taken into consideration.
   This often implies negotiation in order to reach an agreement based on
   the examination of multiple alternatives. This paper describes a spatial
   web/agent-based modeling system that was developed to support the
   negotiation process of stakeholders regarding land development in
   southern Alberta, Canada. This system integrates a fuzzy analytic
   hierarchy procedure within an agent-based model in an interactive
   visualization environment provided through a web interface to facilitate
   the learning and negotiation of the stakeholders. In the pre-negotiation
   phase, the stakeholders compare their evaluation criteria using
   linguistic expressions. Due to the uncertainty and fuzzy nature of such
   comparisons, a fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process is then used to
   prioritize the criteria. The negotiation starts by a development plan
   being submitted by a user (stakeholder) through the web interface. An
   agent called the proposer, which represents the proposer of the plan,
   receives this plan and starts negotiating with all other agents. The
   negotiation is conducted in a step-wise manner where the agents change
   their attitudes by assigning a new set of weights to their criteria. If
   an agreement is not achieved, a new location for development is proposed
   by the proposer agent. This process is repeated until a location is
   found that satisfies all agents to a certain predefined degree. To
   evaluate the performance of the model, the negotiation was simulated
   with four agents, one of which being the proposer agent, using two
   hypothetical development plans. The first plan was selected randomly;
   the other one was chosen in an area that is of high importance to one of
   the agents. While the agents managed to achieve an agreement about the
   location of the land development after three rounds of negotiation in
   the first scenario, seven rounds were required in the second scenario.
   The proposed web/agent-based model facilitates the interaction and
   learning among stakeholders when facing multiple alternatives. (C) 2013

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{410}},
Pages = {{11-20}},

Abstract = {{The impact of continuous phase wax solidification on the isothermal
   rheological properties of water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions at different
   water cuts (10-50 wt\%) was investigated. Rotational viscometry,
   oscillatory rheology and creep compliance and recovery were performed on
   emulsions aged up to 28 days. Higher water cuts yielded emulsions with a
   higher bulk viscosity and storage modulus (G') but lower maximum creep
   compliance (J(max)) values. The development of a more pronounced
   continuous phase wax crystal network with age led to a corresponding
   increase in emulsion bulk viscosity and G' as well as a decrease in
   J(max). Supporting results for these findings were acquired with light
   microscopy, solid wax content, and aqueous droplet size analysis. This
   study established that both water cut and continuous phase wax
   solidification play a significant role in W/O emulsion rheology, though
   this greatly depends on the age of the emulsion. Such findings may be
   used to better understand and tailor emulsion properties in fields such
   as the petrochemical, cosmetics, food and pharmaceutical industries. (C)

Abstract = {{Bibliometric rankings are quite common in the field of software
   engineering. For example, there are a series of ranking repeated every
   year which identify the top researchers and institutions at the
   international level in the field. There are also other studies to
   determine the most cited articles in software engineering journals, the
   most popular research topics in this area, or identify the top
   researchers and institutions in regional levels. However, there exists
   no existing bibliometric quantitative analysis of publications in the
   area of software engineering (SE), including relative and absolute
   growth in the number of all SE publications as well as an analysis among
   countries. This is the main goal and motivation of this article.
   Besides, this study intends to provide an overall quantitative trend of
   the software engineering papers, and compare that trend to research
   output in other areas of science.
   The bibliometric study reported in this paper is motivated by the fact
   that understanding the amount of geographical research contributions to
   the field of software engineering can help identify different countries'
   level of commitment to support research activities in this area over
   years. We analyze how the contribution levels of top-ranked countries
   have changed over the years and how SE compares to other disciplines of
   engineering and science. Among the most interesting findings of this
   study are: (1) Over 40 years, in total about 60\% of the SE literature
   has been contributed by only 7\% of all countries, (2) the SE research
   output of different countries does not necessarily correlate with their
   GDPs, (3) the share of contributions to the SE discipline by the
   American researchers has declined from 71.43\% ( in 1980) to 14.90\% (
   in 2008), and ( 4) China is the country with the biggest share growth in
   the number of publications ( from 0.82\% of the entire SE publications
   in 1991 to 13.82\% in 2009).}},

Abstract = {{In natural and urban canyon environments, Global Navigation Satellite
   System (GNSS) signals suffer from various challenges such as signal
   multipath, limited or lack of signal availability and poor geometry.
   Inertial sensors are often employed to improve the solution continuity
   under poor GNSS signal quality and availability conditions. Various
   fault detection schemes have been proposed in the literature to detect
   and remove biased GNSS measurements to obtain a more reliable navigation
   solution. However, many of these methods are found to be sub-optimal and
   often lead to unavailability of reliability measures, mostly because of
   the improper characterization of the measurement errors. A robust
   filtering architecture is thus proposed which assumes a heavy-tailed
   distribution for the measurement errors. Moreover, the proposed filter
   is capable of adapting to the changing GNSS signal conditions such as
   when moving from open sky conditions to deep canyons. Results obtained
   by processing data collected in various GNSS challenged environments
   show that the proposed scheme provides a robust navigation solution
   without having to excessively reject usable measurements. The tests
   reported herein show improvements of nearly 15\% and 80\% for position
   accuracy and reliability, respectively, when applying the above
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{A vibration harvester is usually designed to work in resonance
   responding to source vibration. Many existing types of harvesters use a
   single mechanical resonator to amplify the excitation vibrations.
   However, these harvesters are inherently limited in the amount of power
   that they can produce, due to their design, particularly in the limited
   number of design parameters. In our study, we propose a two-stage design
   to improve a harvester's performance both in power production and in
   bandwidth widening. In this paper, we demonstrate that a two-stage
   design can increase the power production when the device is intended to
   operate under a single frequency excitation. Harvester parameters are
   optimized to provide maximum power production. Power production
   comparisons between singlestage and two-stage harvesters are made
   through numerical simulation and experiments. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{Phenol was studied as a model pollutant for treatment by adsorption and
   electrochemical regeneration using a graphite intercalation compound
   (GIC) adsorbent in an air agitated sequential batch reactor. The
   mechanism of electrochemical regeneration is important in determining
   the fate of the adsorbed species. The effect of a range of operating
   parameters including current density, pH, electrolyte addition, and the
   initial concentration of phenol on the formation of the intermediate
   oxidation products was investigated.
   The main breakdown products detected were benzoquinone and chlorinated
   organics (chloride was present as an electrolyte in the cathode
   compartment), with small amounts of hydroquinone, catechol, and
   carboxylic acids detected under some conditions. The effect of current
   density on the formation of breakdown products during electrochemical
   regeneration was found to be similar to effects reported in the
   literature for the electrochemical oxidation of a phenol solution. In
   contrast to acidic pH, very low concentrations of benzoquinone were
   observed during electrochemical regeneration of GIC adsorbent under
   neutral and alkaline conditions. The results obtained with high initial
   phenol concentration (100 mg L-1) suggested that breakdown products
   could be formed either by oxidation of adsorbed phenol or indirect
   oxidation of phenol in solution. Comparison of experiments carried out
   with different amounts of adsorbed and dissolved phenol suggested that
   the intermediate oxidation products obtained was formed largely due to
   indirect electrochemical oxidation of organics in solution. In
   particular, it was found that the chlorinated organics detected in
   solution were generated from the indirect oxidation of phenol in
   solution. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was the investigation of travel behavioral
   effects of the reduction in traffic capacity resulting from the
   construction of the West LRT (Light Rail Transit) line in the city of
   Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Travelers' responses to real-time information
   providing traffic updates and advisory detours due to lane/road closures
   were also examined. The West LRT alignment extends approximately 8.2 km
   from downtown into the city's southwest. Many road closures took place
   in the vicinity of the LRT line construction zones, inducing significant
   delays to traffic. Data on travelers' behavioral responses and responses
   to real-time information were obtained by conducting a survey on a
   sample of users of the main road affected by the construction. The
   survey also investigated the effects of West LRT line construction on
   drivers' daily commutes, including increases in travel times, mode
   choices, alternate route choices, and selection of sources of
   information on traffic conditions. A significant change in the selection
   of transportation mode was caused by West LRT construction. Throughout
   the construction period, there was a decrease in the percentage of
   respondents who reported private vehicles as their first choice and an
   increase in the percentage of respondents who preferred public transit
   as their first and second choices. Radio was found to be the most
   preferred source for traffic updates and detour advice, followed by
   variable message signs (VMS). The findings of the en-route information
   model showed that driving experience, employment status, travel time and
   purpose, and desire for pre-trip information had significant effects on
   traveler's rerouting decisions after getting en-route information
   through VMS. The results from this study are of interest for
   understanding behavioral changes for the purposes of traffic management,
   mitigation schemes and design of advanced traveler information systems
   in response to network disruptions. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published

Abstract = {{A simple analytical model for leading-edge vortex (LEV) growth is
   proposed and tested, based on the transport of vorticity-containing mass
   through the shear-layer. The two-dimensional case is validated using
   time-resolved Particle Image Velocimetry. As a precursor to developing a
   model for finite wings, the effect of varying spanwise flow on a
   nominally two-dimensional profile is investigated by imposing plunging
   and flapping motions on high aspect-ratio flat-plate profiles of sweep
   angles Lambda = +45 degrees, -45 degrees and 0 degrees. By varying sweep
   angle, both coinciding and opposing gradients of spanwise vorticity
   stretching and convection were tested. It was shown that nominally
   two-dimensional spanwise flow has no effect on vortex strength and thus
   force history for plunging kinematics. However, force histories for
   flapping kinematics were dependent on sweep angle suggesting that
   spanwise flow regulates vortex strength when coupled with gradients in
   effective incidence. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of the helical vortices measured behind a model wind turbine in
   a water channel are reported. Phase-locked measurements using planar
   particle image velocimetry are taken behind a Glauert rotor to
   investigate the evolution and breakdown of the helical vortex
   structures. Existing linear stability theory predicts helical vortex
   filaments to be susceptible to three unstable modes. The current work
   presents tip and root vortex evolution in the wake for varying tip speed
   ratio and shows a breaking of the helical symmetry and merging of the
   vortices due to mutual inductance between the vortical filaments. The
   merging of the vortices is shown to be steady with rotor phase, however,
   small-scale non-periodic meander of the vortex positions is also
   observed. The generation of the helical wake is demonstrated to be
   closely coupled with the blade aerodynamics, strongly influencing the
   vortex properties which are shown to agree with theoretical predictions
   of the circulation shed into the wake by the blades. The mutual
   inductance of the helices is shown to occur at the same non-dimensional
   wake distance. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Incorporating some heat injection along with solvent injection appears
   to be the most viable option for improving the oil-drainage rate of
   vapour-assisted petroleum extraction (VAPEX) in extraheavy-oil
   formations. This study was intended to quantify the maximum possible
   increase in VAPEX drainage rate that can be obtained by heating the
   formation to a target temperature.
   The experimental phase of this study involved conducting VAPEX
   experiments in a large high-pressure physical model, packed with
   250-darcy sand, using propane as the solvent. The physical model was
   preheated to 40, 50 and 60 degrees C, and propane was injected at the
   same test temperature but different injection pressures to observe how
   injection pressure affects oil-drainage rate at elevated temperatures.
   In the experiments at elevated temperatures, but without increasing the
   injection pressure, higher rate of oil production was achieved in the
   early stages of the process. However, a stabilized rate of oil
   production did not show pronounced improvement caused by a lower
   solubility of propane in the oil at higher temperatures. Increasing
   injection pressure along with increasing the test temperatures was
   successful in accelerating the oil production.
   The oil used in these experiments was found to become mobile with the
   increase in temperature even without solvent dissolution. As a result,
   the total rate of oil production appeared to be controlled by two
   mechanisms: (1) by solvent dissolution and oil mobilization at the
   boundaries of the vapour chamber and (2) by pure free-fall gravity
   drainage beyond the vapour chamber wherever gravity head was sufficient
   to push the mobile oil toward the production well.
   The results of this these tests define the upper limit of oil rates
   achievable with heated solvent injection. They can also be used to
   assess the applicability of VAPEX to warm reservoirs naturally (e.g., in
   Venezuela) and reservoirs with mobile oil in place.}},

Abstract = {{Shale gas reservoirs have become a significant source of gas supply in
   North America because of the advancement of drilling and stimulation
   techniques enabling commercial development. The most popular method for
   exploiting shale gas reservoirs today is the use of long horizontal
   wells completed with multiple-fracturing stages {[}multifractured
   horizontal wells (MFHW)]. The stimulation process may result in biwing
   fractures or a complex hydraulic-fracture network. However, there is no
   method to differentiate between these two scenarios with production data
   analysis alone, making accurate forecasting difficult.
   For simplicity, hydraulic fractures are often considered biwing when
   analyzing production data. A conceptual model that is often used for
   analyzing MFHWs is that of a homogeneous completion in which all
   fractures have the same length. However, fractures of equal length are
   rarely if ever observed (Ambrose et al. 2011).
   In this paper, production data from heterogeneous MFHWs (i.e., where all
   fracture lengths are not the same) is studied for reservoirs with
   extremely low permeability. First, the simplified forecasting method of
   Nobakht et al. (2012), developed for homogeneous completions, is
   extended to heterogeneous completions. For one specific case, the Arps'
   decline exponent is correlated to the heterogeneity of the completion.
   It is found that, as expected, Arps' decline exponent (used after the
   end of linear flow) increases with the heterogeneity of the completion
   Finally, it is shown that ignoring the heterogeneity of the completion
   can have a material effect on the long-term forecast.
   We have assumed planar hydraulic-fracture geometries for our modelling
   in this work and discuss the implications of this when more-complex
   fracture geometries are created. This seems to be more common in shale
   gas reservoirs. We provide an example of low-complexity, planar fracture
   geometries created near an MFHW and observed on an image log at an
   offset well.}},

Abstract = {{Solids deposition from ``waxy{''} mixtures under turbulent flow in a
   pipeline was modeled as a moving boundary problem involving liquid-solid
   phase transformation. The developed model is applicable for the ``hot
   flow{''} regime (i.e., with the mixture temperature above its wax
   appearance temperature, WAT) and the ``cold flow{''} regime (i.e., with
   the mixture temperature below its WAT, resulting in solid particles
   suspended in the liquid phase). A recently proposed correlation for the
   wax precipitation temperature (WPT) as a function of the wax
   concentration and the cooling rate was used to predict the transition
   from the ``hot flow{''} regime to the ``cold flow{''} regime.
   Predictions obtained for both radial and axial deposit growth in the
   pipeline with time in the ``hot flow{''} and ``cold flow{''} regimes
   were found to be in agreement with the trends observed in the laboratory
   deposition results reported in the literature. The predicted deposit
   thickness in the axial direction increased under the ``hot flow{''}
   regime, reached a maximum as the liquid temperature approached the WAT
   of the wax-solvent mixture, and decreased subsequently under the ``cold
   flow{''} regime. The axial location for the transition from the ``hot
   flow{''} regime to the ``cold flow{''} regime was predicted to shift
   with changes in the inlet mixture temperature, pipe wall temperature,
   and Reynolds number. The predicted maximum deposit thickness was also
   impacted by these variables. The predictions in this study indicate that
   solids deposition in pipelines carrying ``waxy{''} mixtures could be
   decreased by maintaining the flow under the ``cold flow{''} regime. This
   study shows that solids deposition from ``waxy{''} mixtures can be
   modeled satisfactorily as a thermally driven process involving partial
   solidification.}},

Abstract = {{Segmentation of the breast region is a fundamental step in any system
   for computerized analysis of mammograms. In this work, we propose a
   novel procedure for the estimation of the breast skin-line based upon
   multidirectional Gabor filtering. The method includes an adaptive
   values-of-interest (VOI) transformation, extraction of the skin-air
   ribbon by Otsu's thresholding method and the Euclidean distance
   transform, Gabor filtering with 18 real kernels, and a step for
   suppression of false edge points using the magnitude and phase responses
   of the filters. On a test set of 361 images from different acquisition
   modalities (screen-film and full-field digital mammograms), the average
   Hausdorff and polyline distances obtained were 2.85 mm and 0.84 mm,
   respectively, with reference to the ground-truth boundaries provided by
   an expert radiologist. When compared with the results obtained by other
   state-of-the-art methods on the same set of images and with respect to
   the same ground-truth boundaries, our method mostly outperformed the
   other approaches. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and
   robustness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{61}},

Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Due to the intermittent nature of the solar radiation, the day-long
   continuous production of cold is a challenge for solar-driven adsorption
   cooling systems. In the present study, a developed solar-powered
   adsorption cooling system is introduced. The proposed system is able to
   produce cold continuously along the 24-h of the day. The theoretical
   thermodynamic operating cycle of the system is based on adsorption at
   constant temperature. Both the cooling system operating procedure as
   well as the theoretical thermodynamic cycle are described and explained.
   Moreover, a steady state differential thermodynamic analysis is
   performed for all components and processes of the introduced system. The
   analysis is based on the energy conservation principle and the
   equilibrium dynamics of the adsorption and desorption processes. The
   Dubinin-Astakhov adsorption equilibrium equation is used in this
   analysis. Furthermore, the thermodynamic properties of the refrigerant
   are calculated from its equation of state. The case studied represents a
   water chiller which uses activated carbon-methanol as the working pair.
   The chiller is found to produce a daily mass of 2.63 kg cold water at 0
   degrees C from water at 25 degrees C per kg of adsorbent. Moreover, the
   proposed system attains a cooling coefficient of performance of 0.66.

Abstract = {{The extensive use of pesticides for increasing the agricultural
   production is affecting the quality of groundwater. The objectives of
   this article are to (i) develop pesticide relative leaching ranks for
   well sites, (ii) develop maps for human health risks due to pesticide
   applications, and (iii) identify the most significant parameters in
   pesticide simulations for groundwater vulnerability assessment. The
   methods include (i) development of acifluorfen relative leaching ranks
   for 25 well sites using ArcPRZM-3, (ii) development of health risk maps
   using model simulated maximum dissolved bentazon concentrations on the
   basis of USA drinking water quality guidelines, (iii) sensitivity
   analysis for 14 ArcPRZM-3 input parameters using the Plackett-Burman
   method. ArcPRZM-3 is a user-friendly system for spatial modeling of
   pesticide leaching from surface to groundwater. Thirteen acifluorfen
   relative leaching potential ranks were developed in which the pesticide
   leaching decrease from 1 to 13. The model predicted ranks for well 34
   and well 9 were 2nd and 3rd, respectively, and acifluorfen was detected
   in both wells during the physical monitoring. The percentages of high
   health risks in the agricultural areas were 48.38 and 72.72\% for
   Randolph and Independence Counties, respectively. The most significant
   parameters were thickness of horizon compartment, runoff curve number of
   antecedent moisture condition II for cropping, soil bulk density, and
   total application of pesticide. The irrigation, soil permeability, and
   numerical dispersion could impact the pesticide leaching in soils toward
   groundwater. The ArcPRZM-3 system could be efficiently applied for
   spatial modeling and mapping of pesticide concentrations for groundwater
   vulnerability assessment on a large scale.}},

Abstract = {{To examine morphology and mechanical properties of the atrial intima,
   which we defined as the tissue interposed between atrial endocardium and
   myocardium, in patients without known cardiovascular disease.
   Post-mortem right and left atrial tissue was obtained from male infants
   (1 year, n 4), children (1019 years, n 4), and adults (5869 years, n 7).
   Using light microscopy and an ocular micrometer, atrial intimal (AIT)
   thickness was measured. Intimal collagen bundle thickness was measured
   using electron microscopy. Passive atrial wall stiffness was measured
   using a planar biaxial testing device. Among infants, left AIT (0.2 0.2
   mm) and right (0.2 0.1 mm) AIT were not significantly different (P
   0.84). Among children, left AIT (0.6 0.2 mm) was significantly greater
   than right (0.2 0.1 mm) AIT (P 0.03), and left AIT was marginally
   greater than in infants (P 0.07). Among adults, with the exception of
   the appendage region, left AIT (1.0 0.2 mm) was markedly greater than
   right AIT (0.3 0.1 mm; P 0.05), and left AIT was significantly greater
   than that in other age groups (P 0.05). There were no differences in
   right AIT among age groups. Left intimal collagen bundle thickness was
   greater in adults (0.0512 0.0056 m) than infants (0.0432 0.0071 m) or
   children (0.0435 0.0013 m), and bundles were less organized. Wall
   stiffness was attributable primarily to the intima (1245 132, vs. 260 45
   N/m(2) for the remaining atrial wall).
   The left atrial intima, but not the right, thickens with age, becomes
   more disorganized ultrastructurally, and is responsible for the majority
   of atrial wall stiffness.}},

Abstract = {{Electromagnetic mixing rules such as the Maxwell-Garnett rule, the
   Bruggeman equation, and the coherent-potential formula, are shown to be
   useful for the evaluation of the porosity exponent m in naturally
   fractured reservoirs represented by dual- and triple-porosity models.
   Comparisons are made with core data from limestone, dolomite, and tight
   gas reservoirs to corroborate results from the theoretical models.
   Rigorous values of m reduce the uncertainty in the calculated values of
   water saturation and, thus, improve the estimates of hydrocarbons in
   place and recoveries, particularly in situations in which sufficient
   data are not available to use the material-balance approach.
   The main advantage of the new method developed in this paper for
   petrophysical analysis is that it can handle, with the use of a single
   equation, the individual mixing rules previously mentioned, and at the
   same time, depending on the availability of data, it can quantify the
   values of matrix, fracture, and nonconnected-vug porosity, and the
   porosity exponent of the total porosity system.
   It is concluded that electromagnetic mixing rides provide a useful
   methodology for the petrophysical evaluation of complex dual- and
   triple-porosity reservoirs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the use of mutli-path inductorless transimpedance
   amplifiers (TIAs), consisting of several different second-order
   shunt-feedback sub-TIAs (SF-sTIAs) driven by the photodiode, to break
   the single-stage technology-dependent transimpedance limit. The
   advantage of the MP-TIA that is explored in this work is in its
   third-order transfer function, which provides additional degrees of
   freedom in tailoring the performance. Pole and zero locations of the
   MP-TIA transfer function are examined and verified with behavioural
   simulations. The theoretical transimpedance limit for MP-TIAs based on
   two SF-sTIAs is derived. The possibility of further increasing the
   transimpedance limit vs bandwidth trade-off by combining three and four
   sub-TIAs is investigated with simulations. A transistor-level design
   example of an MP-TIA is presented. The 0.13-mu m CMOS MP-TIA achieves
   the largest figure-of-merit among published TIAs.}},

   reinforced concrete (RC) structures combines the benefits of the FRP
   reinforcement with the advantages associated with external prestressing.
   By applying a prestress to the NSM FRP the material is used more
   efficiently since a greater portion of its tensile capacity is employed.
   This paper presents a comprehensive review on the performance of RC
   members strengthened using prestressed NSM FRP reinforcement. Several
   techniques and anchorage systems developed to prestress the NSM FRP are
   presented. The static flexural and fatigue performance of RC beams
   strengthened using prestressed NSM FRP in comparison to non-prestressed
   NSM is presented. Research on the long-term performance under
   freeze-thaw exposures and sustained loading is also presented.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel, complexity-reduced, dual-input, two-box
   model for the modeling and digital predistortion of a dual-band power
   amplifier (PA) in the presence of in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) modulator
   imperfections. The model is composed of two cascaded nonlinear blocks.
   The first block is implemented as a mildly nonlinear dual-input
   truncated Volterra filter, which includes second-order cross-terms for
   the mutual characterization of the dynamic mildly nonlinear memory
   effects exhibited by the dual-band PA and for the compensation of I/Q
   imperfections. The second block is implemented as a two-dimensional
   look-up table for the characterization of the static nonlinearity of the
   dual-band PA. The proposed model was evaluated through the excitation of
   the dual-band Doherty PA by two concurrent multi-carrier signals,
   applied at 880 MHz and 1978 GHz, in the presence of I/Q modulator
   imperfections. The experimental results showed the accurate performance
   of the proposed model in suppressing the adjacent channel error power,
   when compared to other state-of-the-art models, the computational
   complexity of the proposed model was significantly reduced, which
   economizes the resources utilized by the model for implementation on a
   digital signal processing/field-programmable gate array platform.}},

Abstract = {{In order to be economically competitive, various control systems are
   used in large scale wind turbines. These systems enable the wind turbine
   to work efficiently and produce the maximum power output at varying wind
   speed. In this paper, an adaptive control based on radial-basis-function
   neural network (NN) is proposed for different operation modes of
   variable-speed variable-pitch wind turbines including torque control at
   speeds lower than rated wind speeds, pitch control at higher wind speeds
   and smooth transition between these two modes The adaptive NN control
   approximates the nonlinear dynamics of the wind turbine based on
   input/output measurements and ensures smooth tracking of the optimal
   tip-speed-ratio at different wind speeds. The robust NN weight updating
   rules are obtained using Lyapunov stability analysis. The proposed
   control algorithm is first tested with a simplified mathematical model
   of a wind turbine, and then the validity of results is verified by
   simulation studies on a 5 MW wind turbine simulator.}},

Abstract = {{The recognition of flow regimes is very important in the application of
   spouted beds. In this paper, two-dimensional computer simulations of a
   slot-rectangular spouted bed using FLUENT commercial software were
   utilised to construct flow regime maps. Two-phase gas-solid flows in the
   bed were simulated with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) using the
   two-phase Eulerian-Eulerian granular model. The numerical simulations
   were applied to predict different flow regimes. The constructed flow
   regime map for a bed containing solid particles with a diameter of
   1.44mm was in good agreement with the experimental map previously
   reported elsewhere. With this successful numerical mapping, a flow
   regime map for particles with a diameter of 3.77mm was constructed for
   various superficial gas velocities and static bed heights. The map was
   composed of six distinct flow patterns, that is fixed bed, internal jet,
   jet-in-fluidised-bed, spouting, incoherent spouting and slugging. The
   slugging flow regime occurred at large values for the static bed height
   and air inlet velocity, while the spouting regime arose by increasing
   the air inlet velocity at low values of static bed height. Unlike the
   spouting regime, large pressure drop fluctuations were observed in the
   incoherent spouting regime.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, three commonly used isoconversional methods, namely:
   Ozawa-Flynn-Wall (OFW), Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS), and the advanced
   non-linear integral method of Vyazovkin (NLN) were employed for the
   first time for calculating the activation energy for thermal cracking of
   Athabasca bitumen under inert conditions. Thermal cracking of Athabasca
   bitumen was carried out at nonisothermal conditions at different heating
   rates under nitrogen atmosphere using thermogravimetic analyzer (TG).
   One isothermal TG experiment was conducted for model prediction.
   Differences in the values of activation energy determined from the three
   methods selected have been demonstrated. These differences were mainly
   attributed to the approximations used for the temperature integral
   employed in the integral methods. Nonetheless, all the methods tested in
   this study provided satisfactory isothermal predictions. The study
   showed that, among the three methods tested, the NLN method provided
   more accurate results. This is because NLN is approximation free and
   uses small time segments for the temperature integral.}},

Title = {{A viscous approach based on oscillatory eigensolutions for

Journal = {{MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING}},

Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{767-782}},

Abstract = {{Dissipative mechanisms in linear multiple-degree-of-freedom viscoelastic
   systems are characterized by the dependence on the history of the
   velocity degrees-of-freedom via convolution integrals over kernel
   functions. As a result, damping matrices are frequency-dependent and, in
   general, state-space approach based methods are widely used for their
   resolution. This paper proposes a new approach suitable for modelling
   such systems via a viscous model with proportional damping, which
   approximates the response of the original viscoelastic system using the
   undamped eigenvectors together with the complex eigenvalues with
   oscillatory nature, neglecting those modes with non-viscous nature
   (negative real eigenvalues). It is rigorously demonstrated that the
   transfer function of any viscoelastic system can be expanded as the sum
   of the transfer function of certain viscous model and a residual term.
   The obtained viscous model, named Equivalent Viscous Model, is
   characteristic of each viscoelastic system. In order to study the bound
   of the residual term two indexes are introduced to describe, on one
   hand, the non-proportionality, or the modal decoupling capability of the
   damping matrix and, on the other hand, the damping level of the system.
   The proposed viscous model is validated through numerical examples
   simulating different conditions of proportionality and damping. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The material properties of articular cartilage are depth-dependent, i.e.
   they differ in the superficial, middle and deep zones. The role of this
   depth-dependent material inhomogeneity in the poromechanical response of
   the knee joint has not been investigated with patient-specific joint
   modeling. In the present study, the depth-dependent and site-specific
   material properties were incorporated in an anatomically accurate knee
   model that consisted of the distal femur, femoral cartilage, menisci,
   tibial cartilage and proximal tibia. The collagen fibers, proteoglycan
   matrix and fluid in articular cartilage and menisci were considered as
   distinct constituents. The fluid pressurization in the knee was
   determined with finite element analysis. The results demonstrated the
   influences of the depth-dependent inhomogeneity on the fluid
   pressurization, compressive stress, first principal stress and strain
   along the tissue depth. The depth-dependent inhomogeneity enhanced the
   fluid support to loading in the superficial zone by raising the fluid
   pressure and lowering the compressive effective stress at the same time.
   The depth-dependence also reduced the tensile stress and strain at the
   cartilage bone interface. The present 3D modeling revealed a complex
   fluid pressurization and 3D stresses that depended on the mechanical
   contact and relaxation time, which could not be predicted by existing 2D
   models from the literature. The greatest fluid pressure was observed in
   the medial condyle, regardless of the depth-dependent inhomogeneity. The
   results indicated the roles of the tissue inhomogeneity in reducing deep

Title = {{Micro-CT evaluation of bone defects: Applications to osteolytic bone
   metastases, bone cysts, and fracture}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL ENGINEERING \& PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{35}},

Pages = {{1645-1650}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Bone defects can occur in various forms and present challenges to
   performing a standard micro-CT evaluation of bone quality because most
   measures are suited to homogeneous structures rather than ones with
   spatially focal abnormalities. Such defects are commonly associated with
   pain and fragility. Research involving bone defects requires
   quantitative approaches to be developed if micro-CT is to be employed.
   In this study, we demonstrate that measures of inter-microarchitectural
   bone spacing are sensitive to the presence of focal defects in the
   proximal tibia of two distinctly different mouse models: a burr-hole
   model for fracture healing research, and a model of osteolytic bone
   metastases. In these models, the cortical and trabecular bone
   compartments were both affected by the defect and were, therefore,
   evaluated as a single unit to avoid splitting the defects into multiple
   analysis regions. The burr-hole defect increased mean spacing (Sp) by
   27.6\%, spacing standard deviation (SpSD) by 113\%, and maximum spacing
   (Sp(max)) by 72.8\%. Regression modeling revealed SpSD (beta = 0.974, p
   <0.0001) to be a significant predictor of the defect volume (R-2 =
   0.949) and Spina), (beta = 0.712, p <0.0001) and SpSD (beta = 0.271, p=
   0.022) to be significant predictors of the defect diameter (R-2 =
   0.954). In the mice with osteolytic bone metastases, spacing parameters
   followed similar patterns of change as reflected by other imaging
   technologies, specifically bioluminescence data which is indicative of
   tumor burden. These data highlight the sensitivity of spacing
   measurements to bone architectural abnormalities from 3D micro-CT data
   and provide a tool for quantitative evaluation of defects within a bone.

Abstract = {{Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture and/or meniscal injury are
   known risk factors for post-traumatic osteoarthritis. We tested the
   hypothesis that increasingly abnormal tibiofemoral centroid path lengths
   and velocities would correlate with the severity of cartilage damage in
   injured sheep. Six sheep underwent combined ACL/medial collateral
   ligament transection (ACL/MCLx), five complete lateral meniscectomy
   (Mx), and four sham arthrotomy (Sham). Weighted centroids were used to
   estimate in vivo tibiofemoral cartilage contact path length during
   stance and the velocity of relative motion. Cartilage morphology was
   graded at dissection. Ligament transection significantly elongated
   plateau centroid path lengths and velocities, whereas condyle paths and
   velocities were reduced. Differences between plateau and femoral
   velocities (relative centroid velocity) were increased up to 10-fold
   over baseline values in the medial compartment. Reductions in Mx lateral
   compartment paths were significantly different from ACL/MCLx paths, but
   not relative to baseline or Sham values. Importantly, only centroid
   velocities consistently correlated with cartilage damage in either
   injury model, suggesting that while path length is valuable in detecting
   changes in the envelope of joint motion, it may average out meaningful
   peaks in the rate of relative motion that more closely relate to the
   mechanisms that might be damaging articular cartilage in these models.

Abstract = {{The nucleation and early-stage growth mechanism and kinetics of
   electrodeposited Ni-Co-SiC composite coating on carbon steel was
   investigated by cyclic voltammetry, current-time transient measurements

   Guglielmi's model for metal-inert particle co-deposition was modified to
   consider the effect of the bath electrolyte hydrodynamics on amount of
   nano-particles deposited in the coating. It is determined that the
   nucleation and early-stage growth of the coating depends on depositing
   overpotential. At low cathodic overpotentials, it is between an
   instantaneous and progressive mechanism; while at high overpotentials,
   it follows the instantaneous mechanism. Addition of SiC nano-particles
   in the bath electrolyte reduces the electrodepositing efficiency by
   inhibiting nucleation and growth of metallic coating. An empirical model
   is developed to estimate the amount of nano-particles contained in
   Ni-Co-SiC composite coating during pulse electrodeposition. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{In this article, the statistical model of the polarimetric synthetic
   aperture radar (SAR) single-look complex image is analysed using

   estimation method based on fractional lower-order statistics (FLOS) is
   proposed. Based on this model, an adaptive polarimetric SAR optimal
   despeckling method based on FLOS is developed. This algorithm adaptively
   estimates the characteristic exponents of each channel and uses these
   estimated alphas to calculate the parameters for the optimal despeckling
   adaptively. The experiments using polarimetric SAR data demonstrate that
   the proposed method not only reduces the blurs that occur in the area of
   impulsive reflectors in the result of the original optimal despeckling
   method, but also maintains the speckle reduction ability (equivalent

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel analytical model for estimating the cache
   hit ratio as a function of time. The cache may not reach the
   steady-state hit ratio when the number of Web objects, object
   popularity, and/or caching resources themselves are subject to change.
   Hence, the only way to quantify the hit ratio experienced by Web users
   is to calculate the instantaneous hit ratio. The proposed analysis
   considers a singleWeb cache with infinite or finite capacity. For a
   cache with finite capacity, two replacement policies are considered:
   Least Recently Used (LRU) and First-In-First-Out (FIFO). Based on the
   insights from the proposed analytical model, we propose a new
   replacement policy, called Frequency-Based-FIFO (FB-FIFO). The results
   show that FB-FIFO outperforms both LRU and FIFO, assuming that the
   number of Web objects is fixed. Assuming that new popular objects are
   generated periodically, the results show that FB-FIFO adapts faster than
   LRU and FIFO to the changes in the popularity of the cached objects when
   the cache capacity is large relative to the number of newly generated
   objects.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral modeling for the concurrent dual-band power amplifier (PA) is
   a critical problem in practical applications. The nonlinear distortion
   in the concurrent dual-band PA is quite different from that in the
   conventional single-band PA. This article analyzes the nonlinearities in
   the concurrent dual-band PA and reveals that both input signals in the
   dual bands are important for the behavioral modeling. The 2D Hammerstein
   model and 2D Wiener model are proposed for the first time for the
   concurrent dual-band PA. They are extended versions of conventional
   Hammerstein and Wiener structures used in the single-band PA by
   including the cross-band intermodulation in the static nonlinearity
   block. The proposed 2D models require much less coefficients than the
   original work of the 2D-DPD model. Experiments were carried out for an
   880 MHz/1960 MHz concurrent dual-band Doherty PA to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed models. The results clearly show that less
   than -40 dB normalized mean square errors (NMSEs) are obtained in the

Abstract = {{The effect of experimental parameters on carbon accumulation in the
   Ni/YSZ anode of SOFC operated at 1,073K with CH4, has been described in
   this paper. Experimental parameters including sealing of the cell to the
   cell holder, operating current, surface coverage by current collector
   paste on the surface of the anode, and the configuration of the current
   collector were evaluated in terms of carbon accumulation at the Ni/YSZ
   anode. The carbon accumulation was quantified using
   temperature-programmed oxidation and cells were examined using scanning
   electron microscopy. The results suggested that variations in any of
   these experimental parameters could significantly increase or decrease
   the amount of carbon accumulation on Ni/YSZ anodes, and hence, the
   reliability of the carbon tolerance studies. In particular, the higher
   the air leakage rate, the less carbon that accumulated on equivalent
   anodes. The extent of surface coverage by current collector paste and
   the configuration of current collector also impacted the amount of
   carbon accumulation. Less carbon accumulated directly below and near the
   areas of current collector paste than on the anode areas directly
   exposed to CH4 and far from the current collector paste. Additionally,
   variations in the fuel humidity and current levels also significantly
   influenced the carbon accumulation.}},

Abstract = {{The world-wide sensor web has become a very useful technique for
   monitoring the physical world at spatial and temporal scales that were

   sensor web's full potential, a geospatial cyberinfrastructure is needed
   to store, process, and deliver large amount of sensor data collected
   worldwide. In this paper, we first define the issue of the sensor web
   long tail followed by our view of the world-wide sensor web
   architecture. Then, we introduce the Geospatial Cyberinfrastructure for
   Environmental Sensing (GeoCENS) architecture and explain each of its
   components. Finally, with demonstration of three real-world
   powered-by-GeoCENS sensor web applications, we believe that the GeoCENS
   architecture can successfully address the sensor web long tail issue and

   preferential dissolution occurs of the steel matrix at the
   inclusion/steel interface, with the inclusion remaining inside the pit.
   For duplex inclusions consisting of both MnS and Al2O3, the Al2O3
   component is dissolved in the pit solution. Pits initiated at Al2O3 and
   Ca/Al/Mg/O inclusions are also due to the preferential dissolution of
   the adjacent steel. However, the Si enriched inclusion is anodic
   relative to the steel matrix, resulting in dissolution of the inclusion
   to initiate pits.}},

Title = {{Impact of solvent type and injection sequence on Enhanced Cyclic Solvent
   Process (ECSP) for thin heavy oil reservoirs}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{110}},
Pages = {{169-183}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A considerable portion of the western Canada's heavy oil resides in thin
   formations. In this situation, thermal methods cannot be used due to
   heat loss to overburden and underburden. Vapor extraction (VAPEX) fails
   because of inefficient gravity drainage and low initial production rate.
   Studies have been done on the cyclic solvent process (CSP) in an attempt
   to speed up the oil production rate in the solvent injection process.
   CSP performs poorly because the presence of continuous free methane
   saturation at the start of production cycles results in high gas
   mobility, and, consequently, quick methane production, quick pressure
   depletion, and a significant loss of oil viscosity reduction. As a
   result, the drive energy becomes depleted by methane production. Also,
   if low or intermediate initial production pressures are used, the
   methane solubility in the oil is not high, and the viscosity reduction
   is not significant. To resolve the above problems of CSP, Yadali
   Jamaloei et al. (2012) introduced a new process for thin reservoirs -
   Enhanced Cyclic Solvent Process (ECSP). In ECSP, two types of
   hydrocarbon solvents are injected separately, in a cyclic manner; one
   slug is more volatile (methane) and the other is more soluble (propane
   or ethane) in heavy oil and bitumen. The focus of this study is finding
   the optimum solvent injection sequence; this will be accomplished
   through examining the impact of the solvent injection sequence on the
   performance of ECSP, using different solvent pairs. The experimental
   results obtained from four series of ECSP tests, each consisting of six
   cycles, show higher oil recovery and production rate, and lower gas
   requirement and drawdown when methane is injected before ethane or
   propane. Wabiskaw formation in the Pelican oilfield in northern Alberta
   with 17 wells was chosen for performing simulation of ECSP. History
   matching was conducted for field-scale cumulative oil, gas and water
   production, and average reservoir pressure. Injection rate and injection
   time of methane and propane, soaking time and minimum well bottom-hole
   pressure in the methane-propane ECSP scheme were optimized to predict
   the field production performance of ECSP. Field-scale simulation
   revealed that the proposed methane-propane ECSP scheme is a highly
   effective method for improving heavy oil recovery in thin reservoirs.

Abstract = {{Carbon dioxide gas hydrates were formed and decomposed in a
   high-pressure cell equipped with a flat glass window that was packed
   with spherical glass beads. The experimental cell was constructed to be,
   for all practical purposes, a one-dimensional cell, and spherical glass
   beads were chosen as the porous medium becaus of their high permeability
   and easily defined geometry. The experiments were conducted at initial
   water saturations of 20, 25, 30, 35, and 42\% with a pressure of 4 MPa
   during gas hydrate formation and 1.65 MPa during decomposition. The
   temperature during the experiments was maintained at 4 degrees C. To
   identify the functional form for the time-dependent gas hydrate surface
   area during decomposition, a sensitivity analysis was conducted with the
   data from one of the experiments. It was found that, in this
   experimental apparatus, packed with glass beads, the gas hydrate surface
   area was most closely approximated with a correlation that assumed the
   hydrate habit to be grain-coating. Subsequently, the selected
   correlation for the surface area for gas hydrates was used in modeling
   the data for the other experiments, and it was found that the modeling
   results agreed excellently with the experimental data.}},

Title = {{Should Alberta upgrade oil sands bitumen? An integrated life cycle
   framework to evaluate energy systems investment tradeoffs}},
Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{78-87}},

Abstract = {{The inclusion of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions costs in energy systems
   investment decision-making requires the development of a framework that
   accounts for GHG and economic tradeoffs. This paper develops such a
   framework by integrating partial cost-benefit analysis with life cycle
   assessment to explore the question of whether bitumen should be upgraded
   in the Canadian province of Alberta to produce synthetic crude oil
   (SCO), or blended with light hydrocarbons to produce lower-quality
   diluted bitumen (dilbit). The net present value (NPV) of these options
   is calculated from the stakeholder perspectives of the oil sands
   industry, the Alberta public, and a climate-concerned Alberta resident.
   This calculation includes monetized GHG emissions costs stemming from a
   hypothetical economy-wide GHG price, and a sensitivity analysis explores
   the effects of variations in technical and economic conditions on
   stakeholders' preferences. We find that under most plausible sets of
   conditions, industry would prefer the dilution option, while the
   climate-concerned Alberta resident would prefer the upgrading option. In
   contrast, the preferences of the general Alberta public depend on the
   values of key variables (e.g., the SCO-dilbit price differential). Key
   drivers of differences among stakeholders' preferences include different
   perceptions of risks and responsibilities for life cycle GHG emissions.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel tag identification mechanism called the

   IDs by their collided bits. Based on the CI method, anti-collision
   protocols coined the Pure Collision Inversion Protocol (PCIP) and the
   Segment Collision Inversion Protocol (SCIP) are proposed. Theoretical
   analysis shows that the identification efficiency of PCIP is decided by
   the ID length and the tag number. SCIP combines the identification
   mechanism of traditional tree-based protocol with PCIP, and becomes
   flexible and efficient. Compared to the mainstream protocols like the
   Query Tree (QT) Protocol, Jumping and Dynamic Searching (JDS) Protocol
   and New Enhanced Anti-Collision Algorithm (NEAA), simulation results
   show that SCIP can reduce both the identification delay and the average
   energy consumption.}},

   sand impact in erosion-corrosion (E-C) of an X65 pipe steel in oil sands
   slurry. Results demonstrated that the steel E-C is resulted from the
   synergistic effect of the hydrodynamic shear stress and mechanical
   impact stress exerted on the steel surface. At low impact angles, such
   as 30A degrees, the effect of shear stress is dominant. The particle
   impact stress becomes dominant when the impact angle increases to a high
   value, such as 90A degrees. It is demonstrated that the maximum of E-C
   of the steel occurs at approximately 45A degrees of the slurry
   impingement.}},

Abstract = {{In the field of bioimpedance measurements the Cole impedance model is
   widely used for characterizing biological tissues and biochemical
   materials describing the impedance behaviour as a function of frequency.
   These measurements give information about the electrochemical processes
   in tissues and can be used to characterize the tissue or monitor for
   physiological changes. Traditionally these parameters are extracted
   using fitting routines on direct measurements of the impedance. Here, a
   method of non-linear least squares fitting (NLSF) is applied to extract
   the single and double-dispersion Cole impedance parameters from
   collected current-excited step response datasets without requiring
   direct impedance measurements. The impedance parameters are extracted
   from MATLAB simulations showing less than 1\% and 5.5\% for the single
   and double dispersion parameters, respectively, when a 0.5\% random
   noise component is present. This extraction is verified experimentally
   using apples as Cole impedances showing less than 2\% relative error
   between simulated responses (using the extracted impedance parameters)
   and the experimental results over the entire dataset. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A home-made micro-electrode technique was used to investigate
   electrochemical corrosion of steel under a chloride-containing water
   drop, simulating the corrosion scenario encountered in pipelines
   transporting diluted bitumen. Potential and potentiodynamic polarization
   curve measurements were conducted at both edge and the centre of the
   water drop. Morphological and topographic characterization was performed
   by an optical microscopy and scanning Kelvin probe. Results demonstrated
   that corrosion of steel under water drop occurs with separated cathodic
   and anodic reaction regions. While the anodic reaction primarily occurs
   at the centre of the water drop, the cathodic reaction occurs dominantly
   at the water edge. Corrosion product is formed and deposited in between,
   shown as a typical corrosion product ring. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

   GS femoral component features should provide better patellar tracking,

   Using novel computed tomography and radiography imaging protocols, 15 GS
   knees were compared to 10 traditional knees, for the 6 degrees of
   freedom of the patellofemoral and tibiofemoral joints throughout the
   range of motion, plus other geometric measures and quality of life
   (QOL). Significant differences were found for patellar medial/lateral
   shift, where the patella was shifted more laterally for the GS femoral
   component. Neither group demonstrated patellar maltracking. There were
   no other significant differences in this well-functioning group. (C)

Abstract = {{Seven coal samples taken from cores drilled in the Cretaceous Mannville
   Group were used for investigation of coal properties and carbon dioxide
   (CO2) gasification. The depths of the cores ranged between 700 and 800 m
   below the surface in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. A new
   method was developed with an average heating rate of 200 K/min using CO2
   as the gasifying agent from the experiment's beginning until its end.
   The coal properties of the seven coals from these deep coal seams showed
   certain similarities and variations. There is an obvious relationship
   between the reactivity and the material properties determined in the
   study. In particular, the specific surface area calculated relative to
   the carbon content measured in the ultimate analysis showed a
   correlation with the reactivity. The ash content and composition also
   appeared to influence char reactivity. The gasification behaviors of the
   in situ coals were compared to those of two surface-mined coals. The new
   method of coal gasification showed a significant difference to those
   that were heated up in an inert gas, such as nitrogen, to the target
   temperature. A maximum rate of reaction did not exist when the new
   method was used, and the integrated core model gave better results than
   the commonly used random pore model in terms of kinetic modeling.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of state space estimation of linear systems in an unknown
   non-Gaussian noise field is considered. A finite Gaussian mixture model
   (GMM) is used to model the non-Gaussian measurement noise with unknown
   statistics. A variational Bayesian expectation maximization (VBEM)
   algorithm is proposed to estimate the system states as well as the
   unknown parameters. In the variational Bayesian expectation (VBE) step,
   approximate inference is established to estimate the system state. The
   Gaussian mixture parameters are then updated in the variational Bayesian
   maximization (VBM) step. We also derive the true marginal posteriors to
   verify the performance of the proposed VBEM method. Computer simulations
   show that the proposed method has an improved estimation performance
   compared with other conventional approaches.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to prepare novel conductive blends of
   poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) with polypyrrole (PPy) and to compare
   their performance with PVDF/multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composites
   and novel PVDF/PPy/MWCNT hybrid systems. All the compositions were
   prepared by melt mixing using a miniature mixer. The mixtures were
   characterized by Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR), wide angle Xray
   diffraction (WAXD), thermogravimetric analyses (TGA), scanning and
   transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM, respectively) and volume
   electrical resistivity. For the binary PVDF/PPy and PVDF/MWCNT systems,
   percolation thresholds of 10 and 0.3 wt\%, respectively, were found. In
   the hybrid systems, however, the percolation threshold for each filler
   was lower than in the binary systems, but the electrical conductivities
   were always much higher at all concentrations than the conductivities of
   the binary systems. Therefore, the addition of both fillers had a
   synergistic effect on the hybrid system conductivity, which was
   attributed to its morphology: the PPy increased the homogeneity of the
   MWCNT distribution and decreased the available free volume for the
   MWCNT; as a result the MWCNT rolled around the PPy particles bridging
   them through the PVDF matrix, increasing the quantum tunneling effect
   and thus, the electrical conductivity of the system. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Impact loading of articular cartilage causes extensive chondrocyte
   death. Cell membranes have a limited elastic range of 3-4\% strain but
   are protected from direct stretch during physiological loading by their
   membrane reservoir, an intricate pattern of membrane folds. Using a
   finite-element model, we suggested previously that access to the
   membrane reservoir is strain-rate-dependent and that during impact
   loading, the accessible membrane reservoir is drastically decreased, so
   that strains applied to chondrocytes are directly transferred to cell
   membranes, which fail when strains exceed 3-4\%. However, experimental
   support for this proposal is lacking. The purpose of this study was to
   measure the accessible membrane reservoir size for different membrane
   strain rates using membrane tethering techniques with atomic force
   microscopy. We conducted atomic force spectroscopy on isolated
   chondrocytes (n = 87). A micron-sized cantilever was used to extract
   membrane tethers from cell surfaces at constant pulling rates. Membrane
   tethers could be identified as force plateaus in the resulting
   force-displacement curves. Six pulling rates were tested (1, 5, 10, 20,
   40, and 80 mu m/s). The size of the membrane reservoir, represented by
   the membrane tether surface areas, decreased exponentially with
   increasing pulling rates. The current results support our theoretical
   findings that chondrocytes exposed to impact loading die because of
   membrane ruptures caused by high tensile membrane strain rates.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Joint space narrowing is an important feature of progressive
   joint damage and functional impairment in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
   Methods to provide a continuous measurement of joint space width have
   not been adopted in research or clinical settings. High-resolution
   peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) (Scanco Medical
   AG, Bruttisellen, Switzerland) accurately and reproducibly images bone
   microstructure at a nominal isotropic voxel dimension of 82 mu m. Given
   the ability of HR-pQCT to detect bone margins with high precision, we
   developed methodology to measure a three-dimensional (3D)
   metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint space width and tested the
   reproducibility of the scan protocol with hand repositioning.
   Materials and methods: Consecutive HR-pQCT scans of the 2nd and 3rd MCP
   joints of ten subjects with early RA (70\% female, mean age 45 years),
   with repositioning between scans, were obtained. The periosteal edges of
   the metacarpal head and proximal phalanx base were detected using the mu
   CT Evaluation Program V6.0 (Scanco Medical AG). Using the method of
   `fitting maximal spheres', the joint space width and distribution of
   joint space thickness was estimated.
   Results: The mean minimum joint space width of the 2nd MCP was 1.82 mm
   (SD 0.20) and of the 3rd MCP 1.84 mm (SD 0.23). Reproducibility with
   repositioning was reliable, with overlapping filtered histograms and a
   root square mean coefficient of variance of 4.8\%.
   Conclusions: We provide reproducible methodology for evaluating the
   joint space width of the MCP joints. When combined with the assessment
   of erosions and periarticular bone density, HR-pQCT may be the ideal
   technology to assess disease activity and progression in RA. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Automatic detection of the nipple in mammograms is an important step in
   computerized systems that combine multiview information for accurate
   detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. Locating the nipple is a
   difficult task owing to variations in image quality, presence of noise,
   and distortion and displacement of the breast tissue due to compression.
   In this work, we propose a novel Hessian-based method to locate
   automatically the nipple in screen-film and full-field digital
   mammograms (FFDMs). The method includes detection of a plausible
   nipple/retroareolar area in a mammogram using geometrical constraints,
   analysis of the gradient vector field by mean and Gaussian curvature
   measurements, and local shape-based conditions. The proposed procedure
   was tested on 566 mammographic images consisting of 372 randomly
   selected scanned films from two public databases (mini-MIAS and DDSM),
   and 194 digital mammograms acquired with a GE Senographe 2000D FFDM
   system. A radiologist independently marked the centers of the nipples
   for evaluation of the results. The average error obtained was 6.7 mm (22
   pixels) with reference to the center of the nipple as identified by the
   radiologist. Only two out of the 566 detected nipples (0.35 \%) had an
   error larger than 50 mm. The method was also directly compared with two
   other techniques for the detection of the nipple. The results indicate
   that the proposed method outperforms other algorithms presented in the
   literature and can be used to identify accurately the nipple on various
   types of mammographic images.}},

   convection of vorticity, rather than vortex stretching, mitigates
   arch-vortex formation. The vortical near wake that is formed by the

   cover and weather model}},
Journal = {{COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{94}},
Pages = {{37-44}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The snow cover model SNOWPACK simulates snow cover formation and
   evolution based on meteorological data. In the past, these data were
   measured by automated weather stations. Recently, SNOWPACK was also
   forced with data from numerical weather prediction models (NWP). In this
   study we assess the capability of such a model chain to simulate two
   types of critical layers, i.e. surface hoar and melt-freeze crusts, for
   virtual north and south-facing slopes as well as a flat study plot.
   Meteorological key parameters for snow cover formation and evolution,
   e.g. precipitation, radiation, air temperature and relative humidity,
   were measured and compared to the forecasted data to evaluate the
   performance of the NWP model. Systematic errors of the NWP model were
   corrected and the adjusted data were used to force SNOWPACK. The
   formation of 80 critical layers - 35 surface hoar layers and 45
   melt-freeze crusts - from seven winters between 2005 and 2012 observed
   in the Columbia Mountains of British Columbia, Canada were investigated.
   To assess the performance of SNOWPACK at simulating the presence and
   absence of critical layers on different aspects, monthly manual snow
   profiles systematically observed on north, south and flat terrains
   between January and March during the winter of 2010-2011 were compared
   to the corresponding snow cover simulations. The overall accuracy to
   predict the formation of melt-freeze crusts was found to be between 65\%
   and 77\% depending on the aspect. Surface hoar layers were modeled with
   accuracy between 89\% and 100\%. The presence and absence of critical
   layers within the snow cover - surface hoar and melt-freeze crusts -
   were investigated during the winter of 2010-2011. Ten out of eleven
   observed critical layers within the snow cover were simulated, resulting
   in an accuracy of 91\%. However, some surface hoar layers and
   melt-freeze crusts were simulated but not observed resulting in a low
   accuracy for the absence of critical layers. The simulated snow height
   tended to be under-estimated during the early winter season and
   over-estimated during the late winter season for both slopes and the
   flat site, especially in March on the south-facing aspect. Nevertheless,
   the model chain is promising considering the source of the input data.
   This study showed that such a model chain could become a useful tool for
   avalanche warning services in the future, especially for data sparse
   areas. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A major obstacle that limits the productivity in machining operations is
   the presence of machine tool chatter. Machining is a dynamic process and
   chatter behavior depends upon a number of different aspects including
   spindle speeds, material properties, tool geometry, and even the
   location of tool respect to the rest of machine. Many of the traditional
   models used to predict chatter stability lobes assume that parameters
   such as natural frequency, stiffness, and cutting coefficients remain
   constant. In reality, these parameters vary and they affect the chatter
   stability. The uncertainty in these parameters can be taken into
   consideration by employing the robust stability theory into a two degree
   of freedom milling model. Utilizing the Edge theorem and the Zero
   Exclusion condition, a robust chatter stability model, based on the
   analytical chatter stability milling model, is developed. This improves
   the reliability compared to the projected pseudo single degree of
   freedom model. The method is verified experimentally for milling
   operations while considering a changing natural frequency and cutting
   coefficient. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd on

Abstract = {{In recent years, demands for miniature components have increased-due to
   their reduced size, weight and energy consumption. In particular,
   brittle materials such as glass can provide high stiffness, hardness,
   corrosion resistance and high-temperature strength for various
   biomedical and high-temperature applications. In this study, cutting
   properties and the effects of machining parameters on the ductile
   cutting of soda-lime glass are investigated through the nano-scale
   scratching process. In order to understand the fundamentals of the
   material removal mechanism at the atomic scale, such as machined surface
   quality, cutting forces and the apparent friction, theoretical
   investigation along with experimental study are needed. Scribing tests
   have been performed using a single crystal diamond atomic force
   microscope (AFM) probe as the scratching tool, in order to find the
   cutting mechanism of soda-lime glass in the nanoscale. The extended
   lateral force calibration method is proposed to acquire accurate lateral
   forces. The experimental thrust and cutting forces are obtained and
   apparent friction coefficients are deduced. The effects of feed rates
   and the ploughing to shearing transition of soda-lime glass have been
   investigated. (C) 2013 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers. Published

Abstract = {{The loading of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments (ACL and
   PCL) during normal gait has not been quantified. Also, it is not clear
   whether ligaments under ``static{''} physiological loads commonly used
   in cadaveric studies behave similarly to normal gait experienced in
   vivo. We measured the in vivo kinematics of the stifle joint of sheep (N
   = 4) during ``normal gait,{''} then reproduced these gait paths using a
   robotic system. The loads borne by the cruciate ligaments were
   determined using the principle of superposition and plotted against each
   other. This indicated some functional interaction between the ACL and
   PCL under in vivo physiological loads. To examine this relationship
   under static loading conditions, cadaveric knees (N = 6) were tested in
   the anterior-posterior (AP) direction, along the axes of the ACL and the
   PCL, as well as under combined AP and tibial rotations. The same process
   was repeated after either the ACL (N = 3) or the PCL (N = 3) was
   transected. Our results show a mutually exclusive relationship in ACL
   and PCL load bearing under both ``in vivo gait{''} and ``static{''}
   loading conditions. High ACL loads were associated with low PCL loads
   and vice versa. This is a novel study quantifying the actions of the
   cruciate ligaments during gait and comparing them to commonly used
   static loading conditions in cadaveric studies.}},

Title = {{Regional variations in trabecular architecture of the lumbar vertebra:

Journal = {{BONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{249-254}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies suggest that age and disc degeneration are associated
   with variations in vertebral trabecular architecture. In particular,
   disc space narrowing, a severe form of disc degeneration, may predispose
   the anterior portion of a vertebra to fracture. We studied 150 lumbar
   vertebrae and 209 intervertebral discs from 48 cadaveric lumbar spines
   of middle-aged men to investigate regional trabecular differences in
   relation to age, disc degeneration and disc narrowing. The degrees of
   disc degeneration and narrowing were evaluated using radiography and
   discography. The vertebrae were dried and scanned on a mu CT system. The
   mu CT images of each vertebral body were processed to include only
   vertebral trabeculae, which were first divided into superior and
   inferior regions, and further into central and peripheral regions, and
   then anterior and posterior regions. Structural analyses were performed
   to obtain trabecular microarchitecture measurements for each vertebral
   region. On average, the peripheral region had 12-15\% greater trabecular
   bone volume fraction and trabecular thickness than the central region (p
   < 0.01). Greater age was associated with better trabecular structure in
   the peripheral region relative to the central region. Moderate and
   severe disc degeneration were associated with higher trabecular
   thickness in the peripheral region of the vertebral trabeculae (p <
   0.05). The anterior region was of lower bone quality than the posterior
   region, which was not associated with age. Slight to moderate narrowing
   was associated with greater trabecular bone volume fraction in the
   anterior region of the inferior vertebra (p < 0.05). Similarly, greater
   disc narrowing was associated with higher trabecular thickness in the
   anterior region (p < 0.05). Better architecture of peripheral trabeculae
   relative to central trabeculae was associated with both age and disc
   degeneration. In contrast to the previous view that disc narrowing
   stress-shields the anterior vertebra, disc narrowing tended to associate
   with better trabecular architecture in the anterior region, as opposed
   to the posterior region. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Bone micro-architecture, estimated bone strength, and the muscle-bone
   interaction in elite athletes: An HR-pQCT study}},
Journal = {{BONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{281-289}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Athletes participating in sports characterized by specific loading
   modalities have exhibited different levels of augmentation of bone
   properties; however, the extent to which these loading environments
   affect bone micro-architecture and estimated bone strength (i.e. bone
   quality) remains unclear. Furthermore, the relative role of impact
   loading versus loading due to muscle forces in determining bone
   properties is confounded. The objectives of this study were 1) to
   examine the role of impact loading on bone quality of the distal radius
   and distal tibia in elite athletes, as determined by high resolution
   peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) and finite element
   analysis (FEA), and 2) to investigate the relationship between bone
   quality and muscle strength in elite athletes. Ninety-five females (n =
   59) and males (n = 36) between the ages of 16-30 years participated in
   the study. Participants included alpine skiers (high-impact), soccer
   players (moderate impact), swimmers (low-impact), and non-athletic
   controls.
   All group comparisons were made after accounting for age, height, and
   body mass. As expected, minimal differences in HR-pQCT parameters across
   groups were observed at the non weight-bearing distal radius. At the
   weight-bearing distal tibia, female alpine skiers and soccer players had
   significantly higher bone density, cortical thickness, and failure load
   (i.e. bone strength (N) in compression estimated by FEA) than swimmers
   (p < 0.05). Female alpine skiers also had lower trabecular separation
   than swimmers and controls. Male alpine skiers had 20\% higher
   trabecular bone mineral density than swimmers, and male soccer players
   exhibited 22\% higher trabecular number than swimmers at the distal
   tibia (p < 0.05). Male alpine skiers and soccer players had 28-38\%
   higher failure load at the distal tibia than swimmers. No differences in
   bone parameters were observed between swimmers and controls for either
   sex at either site. Both muscle strength and sporting activity were
   predictors of failure load at the distal tibia in the female cohort.
   Sporting activity, but not muscle strength, was a significant predictor
   of failure load in the male cohort at both the radius and tibia. This
   data suggests that impact loading in sporting activity is highly
   associated with bone quality. Longitudinal and interventional studies
   are required to further clarify the muscle-bone interaction. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Fast identification for large number of tags is required in many RFID
   applications. To improve the identification efficiency, current tag
   reading protocols try to schedule the identification process with fewer
   collisions, since the reader cannot identify the transmission tag IDs
   when multibit collision happens. This paper proposes a novel tag reading
   protocol called the multibit identification (MBI) protocol, the reader
   of which can identify certain length of transmission ID-strings
   simultaneously by making full use of the collided bits. The basic idea
   of MBI is to identify the reader's receiving sequence multibit by
   multibit. When no collision happens in current identification unit, the
   reader identifies the corresponding transmission ID-string directly.
   When there is a single collided bit, the reader deduces the transmission
   ID-strings by splitting the collided bit into binary-0 and binary-1.
   Otherwise, a special slot called the M-slot will be activated, where the
   collided ID-strings of the previous slot are grouped according to a
   special grouping scheme and corresponding responses are made, so that
   the reader can deduce these ID-strings according to their collided bits.
   Compared with traditional tag reading protocols such as QT, JDS, and
   NEAA, simulation results show that MBI protocol can promise higher
   identification efficiency and smaller communication overhead.}},

   viscosity of pure 2-propanol were measured at the temperatures (303 and
   323) K over the pressure range (0.1 to 10) MPa. The dissolution of
   carbon dioxide in 2-propanol caused a decline in the viscosity of
   saturated liquid phase while an increase in the density of gas-expanded
   liquid was observed. The viscosity-pressure trends for methane- and
   ethane-saturated liquid viscosities were similar to carbon dioxide, but
   the saturated liquid densities decreased with the dissolution of methane
   and ethane in 2-propanol. Solubility increased with pressure and
   decreased with temperature for all compressed gases (methane, ethane and
   carbon dioxide). The experimental data were well correlated using
   Soave-Redlich-Kwong and Peng-Robinson equations of state. The
   solubilities and saturated liquid densities were well represented with
   both equations of state, and there is no superior equation of state for
   the modeling of the phase compositions and saturated liquid densities.

Abstract = {{A method is introduced to predict uncertainties of the B-spline freeform
   surfaces that are reconstructed from the measurement points for
   inspection of freeform surfaces. The uncertainties of a reconstructed
   B-spline surface are modeled by variances of coordinates of points on
   this freeform surface. Prediction of the uncertainty at any location on
   the reconstructed B-spline surface is carried out in two steps: (1)
   estimation of variances of the B-spline surface's control points
   introduced by the surface reconstruction process, and (2) propagation of
   the variances from the control points to the points on the B-spline
   freeform surface. In this research, the variances of the control points
   of the reconstructed B-spline surface in all three directions are
   considered to improve the accuracy of uncertainty prediction in the
   regions with significant changes of geometric shapes. Both the errors
   and uncertainties at different locations on the reconstructed surface
   are considered in freeform surface inspection to compare the
   manufactured surface against the design surface and its tolerance. The
   developed method has been applied to two case studies to demonstrate its
   effectiveness. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Heterotopic mineralization may result in tendon weakness, but effects on
   other biomechanical responses have not been reported. We used a needle
   injury, which accelerates spontaneous mineralization of murine Achilles
   tendons, to test two hypotheses: that injured tendons would demonstrate
   altered biomechanical responses; and that unilateral injury would
   accelerate mineralization bilaterally. Mice underwent left hind (LH)
   injury (I; n=11) and were euthanized after 20 weeks along with
   non-injured controls (C; n=9). All hind limbs were examined by micro
   computed tomography followed by biomechanical testing (I=7 and C=6). No
   differences were found in the biomechanical responses of injured tendons
   compared with controls. However, the right hind (RH) tendons
   contralateral to the LH injury exhibited greater static creep strain and
   total creep strain compared with those LH tendons (p0.045) and RH
   tendons from controls (p0.043). RH limb lesions of injured mice were
   three times larger compared with controls (p=0.030). Therefore, despite
   extensive mineralization, changes to the responses we measured were
   limited or absent 20 weeks postinjury. These results also suggest that
   bilateral occurrence should be considered where tendon mineralization is
   identified clinically. This experimental system may be useful to study
   the mechanisms of bilateral new bone formation in tendinopathy and other
   conditions. (c) 2013 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine changes in (1) proteoglycan
   4 (PRG4) and hyaluronan (HA) concentration, (2) HA molecular weight (MW)
   distribution, and (3) cartilage boundary lubricating ability of synovial
   fluid (SF) from surgical sham (SHAM), anterior cruciate ligament
   (ACL)/medial collateral ligament (MCL) transection, and lateral
   meniscectomy (MEN) in a post-knee surgery ovine model. Ovine SF (oSF)
   was collected at euthanization 20 weeks after surgery, with the
   contralateral joint serving as the non-operative control. PRG4 and HA
   concentration in oSF was measured by sandwich enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay, and HA MW distribution by agarose gel
   electrophoresis. Cartilage boundary lubricating ability of oSF was
   measured by a cartilage-cartilage friction test. PRG4 and HA
   concentration in SHAM, ACL/MCL, and MEN oSF were similar in comparison
   to the contralateral control (CTRL) oSF. The HA MW distribution in the
   operated oSF for all ranges were similar to the respective CTRL oSF. The
   kinetic coefficients of friction in operated and CTRL oSF were similar
   in all groups, and were significantly lower than saline. These results
   indicate oSF lubricant composition and function at 20 weeks post-knee
   surgery were similar to contralateral CTRL, and suggest earlier time
   points post surgery warrant further investigation. (c) 2013 Orthopaedic

Abstract = {{The semi-solid transient liquid-phase bonding (Semi-solid TLP bonding)
   of titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V to magnesium alloy Mg-AZ31 was performed
   using a eutectic forming nickel foil. The process parameters were
   optimized to achieve higher shear strength. The effect of temperature
   and pressure on microstructure evolution and mechanical characteristics
   were examined for bonding time between 5 and 60 min. Three reaction
   layers L1, L2 at Ni/Mg-AZ31 interface and L3 along the Ni/Ti-6Al-4V
   interface were determined within joint zone at a bonding temperature of
   515 A degrees C. The L1 and L2 reaction layers continued to be seen when
   the bonding temperature increased to 540 A degrees C. When the bonding
   pressure increases from 0.2 to 0.7 MPa, a new reaction layer L4, at the
   Ni/Ti-6Al-4V interface was observed. The results showed that as the
   bonding time increased up to 60 min, the width of the joint decreased
   due to isothermal solidification. Maximum shear strength of 39 MPa was
   obtained for 540 A degrees C and 0.2 MPa with a holding time of 20 min.
   However, further increase in bonding time to 60 min resulted in a
   decrease in shear strength to 8 MPa, and this decrease in strength was
   attributed to the increase in intermetallics forming within the joint
   zone.}},

Title = {{Optimized solvent-aided steam-flooding strategy for recovery of thin
   heavy oil reservoirs}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{112}},
Pages = {{50-59}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Stochastic optimization based on a simulated annealing method was
   carried out to determine the optimum steam and steam-solvent flooding
   strategies in a thin (4 m) heavy oil reservoir both in the absence and
   presence of a bottom water zone. The steam injection pressure
   optimization case determined a technically feasible operating strategy.
   However, the cumulative energy to produced oil ratio (cEOR) realized
   from the optimized process is high. In comparison, the solvent-aided
   steam optimization case achieved an operating strategy with a much lower
   cEOR and cumulative water-to-oil ratio (cWOR) than those in the
   optimized injection pressure-only strategy. We observed that a
   solvent-rich channel forms at the top of the reservoir after solvent
   breakthrough occurs at the production well. The formation of the
   solvent-rich channel led to oil-solvent mixing at the periphery of the
   channel as well as heat transfer to oil beyond the channel, which in
   turn resulted in better recovery performance. In the presence of a
   bottom water zone, the optimized steam injection pressure optimization
   strategy was found to perform poorly. However, the optimized
   solvent-aided strategy achieved superior performance. With solvent
   injection, the presence of the bottom water zone enhanced mixing of
   solvent and oil yielding improved oil recovery performance. (C) 2013

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{112}},
Pages = {{83-95}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The viscosity of bitumen is extremely high at ambient temperature and in
   order to produce and transport the bitumen, it is necessary to reduce
   its viscosity. One of the methods to reduce the bitumen viscosity is the
   dilution with liquid solvent. In this manuscript, the density and
   viscosity of bitumen, tetradecane, and their mixtures at different
   weight fractions have accurately been measured. The measurements were
   taken under conditions applicable for both in situ recovery methods and
   pipeline transportation of heavy oil. The experiments were conducted
   using Athabasca bitumen and tetradecane at temperatures varying from
   ambient up to 343 K and at pressures up to 10 MPa on mixtures with 0.05,
   0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 weight fractions of solvent. The generated
   experimental data for raw bitumen and tetradecane were correlated with
   the existing correlation models in the literature. The data for the
   mixtures were also evaluated with predictive schemes as well as with
   correlation models representing certain mixing rules proposed in the
   literature. The influence of pressure, temperature, and solvent weight
   fraction on the density and viscosity of mixtures was considered in the
   models and evaluated from the experimental results. The density data are
   reasonably predicted using an equation without adjustable parameter in
   which it is assumed that no volume change occurs. The viscosity data for
   the mixtures are well correlated with Lederer's and power law models.

   Using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, the deposition rate
   constants of nanoparticles into angiogenic blood vessel tissue are
   determined. It is shown that deposition is dependent on surface charge.
   Moreover, the size dependency strongly suggests that nanoparticles are
   taken up by a passive mechanism that depends largely on geometry. These
   findings imply that it is possible to tune nanoparticle pharmacokinetics
   simply by adjusting nanoparticle size.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{SEP 23}},
Abstract = {{One factor which may be important for determining proper lesion creation
   during atrial ablation is catheter-endocardial contact. Little
   information is available that relates geometric contact, depth and
   angle, to ablation lesion formation. We present an electrothermal
   computer model of ablation that calculated lesion volume and temperature
   development over time. The Pennes bioheat equation was coupled to a
   quasistatic electrical problem to investigate the effect of catheter
   penetration depth, as well as incident catheter angle as may occur in
   practice. Biological experiments were performed to verify the modelling
   of electrical phenomena. Results show that for deeply penetrating tips,
   acute catheter angles reduced the rate of temperature buildup, allowing
   larger lesions to form before temperatures elevated excessively. It was
   also found that greater penetration did not lead to greater
   transmurality of lesions. We conclude that catheter contact angle plays
   a significant role in lesion formation, and the time course must be
   considered. This is clinically relevant because proper identification
   and prediction of geometric contact variables could improve ablation
   efficacy.}},

Title = {{Scaling and unified characterization of flow instabilities in layered
   heterogeneous porous media}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP 23}},
Abstract = {{The physics of miscible flow displacements with unfavorable mobility
   ratios through horizontal layered heterogeneous media is investigated.
   The flow model is solved numerically, and the effects of various
   physical parameters such as the injection velocity, diffusion,
   viscosity, and the heterogeneity length scale and variance are examined.
   The flow instability is characterized qualitatively through
   concentration contours as well as quantitatively through the mixing zone
   length and the breakthrough time. This characterization allowed us to
   identify four distinct regimes that govern the flow displacement.
   Furthermore, a scaling of the model resulted in generalized curves of
   the mixing zone length for any flow scenario in which the first three
   regimes of diffusion, channeling, and lateral dispersion superpose into
   a single unifying curve and allowed us to clearly identify the onset of
   the fourth regime. A critical effective Peclet number w(c){*} based on
   the layers' width is proposed to identify flows where heterogeneity
   effects are expected to be important and those where the flow can be
   safely treated as homogeneous. A similar scaling of the breakthrough
   time was obtained and allowed us to identify two optimal effective
   Peclet numbers w(opt){*} that result in the longest and shortest
   breakthrough times for any flow displacement.}},

Abstract = {{Several vulnerabilities of single-photon detectors have recently been
   exploited to compromise the security of quantum-key-distribution (QKD)
   systems. In this Letter, we report the first proof-of-principle

   to any such attack. More precisely, we demonstrated this new approach to
   QKD in the laboratory over more than 80 km of spooled fiber, as well as
   across different locations within the city of Calgary. The robustness of
   our fiber-based implementation, together with the enhanced level of
   security offered by the protocol, confirms QKD as a realistic technology
   for safeguarding secrets in transmission. Furthermore, our demonstration
   establishes the feasibility of controlled two-photon interference in a
   real-world environment and thereby removes a remaining obstacle to
   realizing future applications of quantum communication, such as quantum
   repeaters and, more generally, quantum networks.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{46-55}},
Month = {{SEP 20}},
Abstract = {{The effects of reversibility on the viscous fingering of miscible
   reactive How displacement processes are examined. A model, where the
   viscosity mismatch between the reactants and the product triggers
   instability is adopted. The stability of the How displacement is
   examined in the case of initial sharp front between the two reactants as
   well as when the reactants are given time to diffuse. In the case of a
   sharp front, a transformation allows to map the reversible case to that
   of the nun reversible one and an analysis of the effects of chemical
   reversibility is presented. In general, faster attenuation in the
   development and growth of instability is reported as the reversibility
   of the chemical reaction increases. However, it was found that
   reversibility can actually enhance the instability when a critical
   reversibility coefficient that depends on the mobility ratios of the
   chemical species, is exceeded. Different trends for the effects of
   reversibility were obtained for initially diffusing chemical reactants
   and the results are discussed in terms of the mobility ratios of the
   different species. It was found that the effects of stronger chemical
   reversibility on the stability of the flow are qualitatively similar to
   those induced by slower chemical reactions in non-reversible cases,
   however quantitative differences are reported and discussed. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This paper investigates two fundamental structures for biped robots and
   a control strategy to achieve stable biped running. The first biped
   structure contains straight legs with telescopic springs, and the second
   one contains knees with compliant elements in parallel with the motors.
   With both configurations we can use a standard linear discrete-time
   state-feedback control strategy to achieve an active periodic stable
   biped running gait, using the Poincare map of one complete step to
   produce the discrete-time model. In this case, the Poincare map
   describes an open-loop system with an unstable equilibrium, requiring a
   closed-loop control for stabilization. The discretization contains a
   stance phase, a flight phase and a touch-down. In the first approach,
   the control signals remain constant during each phase, while in the
   second approach both phases are discretized into a number of
   constant-torque intervals, so that its formulation can be applied easily
   to stabilize any active biped running gait. Simulation results with both
   the straight-legged and the kneed biped model demonstrate stable gaits
   on both horizontal and inclined surfaces.}},

Title = {{Inter-insertional distance is a poor correlate for ligament load:
   Analysis from in vivo gait kinetics data}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{13}},

Abstract = {{In many analytic models of the knee joint, inter-insertional distance is
   used as the measure to define the load in a ligament. In addition, the
   direction of the load is taken to be the direction between the two
   insertions. Our in vivo data on the ovine ligament loads during gait,
   however, indicate that a wide range of forces is possible in the
   ligament for any specified inter-insertional distance. To understand the
   complex relationship between the bone orientations and ligament load
   better, an artificial neural network (ANN) model was developed. The six
   degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) in vivo kinematics of femur relative to tibia
   (joint kinematics) was used as input, and the magnitude of the anterior
   cruciate ligament (ACL) load was used as output/target. While the
   trained network was able to predict peak ligament loads with remarkable
   accuracy (R-square=0.98), an explicit relationship between joint
   kinematics and ACL load could not be determined. To examine the
   experimental and ANN observations further, a finite element (FE) model
   of the ACL was created. The geometry of the FE model was reconstructed
   from magnetic resonance images (MRI) of an ACL, and an isotropic,
   hyperelastic, nearly incompressible constitutive model was implemented
   for the ACL. The FE simulation results also indicate that a range of
   loads is possible in the ACL for a given inter-insertional distance, in
   concordance with the experimental/ANN observations. This study provides
   new insights for models of the knee joint; a simple force-length
   relationship for the ligament is not exact, nor is a single point to
   single point direction. More detailed microstructure-function data is
   required. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Starting with the established concepts of multi-dimensional network
   resonance, practical-bounded-input-bounded-output (BIBO) stability of
   multi-dimensional discrete systems, and the integer order approximation
   of fractional order filters, a new method for the realization of
   integer-order approximations of 2-D fractional-order systems having
   frequency-planar beam shaped passbands is proposed. The method results
   in 2-D infinite impulse response (IIR) filters having nonseparable
   denominators in their transfer-functions while having guaranteed
   practical-BIBO stability for zero initial conditions in the
   corresponding discrete system. The resulting integer-order filters are
   shown to approximate 2-D fractional order frequency-planar beam shapes
   in both magnitude and phase leading to a new theoretical tool for use in
   the emerging area of multi-dimensional fractional-order circuits and
   systems. Although examples are provided for frequency-planar filters in
   two dimensions, the proposed methods are equally applicable to other
   types of transfer-functions having prototypes based on
   resistively-terminated passive networks defined over any integer number
   of dimensions.}},

Abstract = {{A variety of experimental techniques were applied to a single source
   asphaltene sample at the same experimental conditions in order to reveal
   the possible size distributions of asphaltene monomers and aggregates.
   The asphaltene sample was divided into solubility cuts by selective
   precipitation in solutions of heptane and toluene. Asphaltene
   self-association was assessed through a combination of density, vapor
   pressure osmometry (VPO), elemental analysis, Fourier transform-ion
   cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry, and time-resolved
   fluorescence emission spectra measurements performed on each cut. The
   physical dimensions of the asphaltenes were assessed using SAXS, DLS,
   membrane diffusion, Rayleigh scattering, and nanofiltration
   measurements:Molecular and nanoaggregate dimensions were also
   investigated through a combination of interfacial tension, interfacial
   adsorption, and surface force measurements.
   All of the measurements indicated that approximately 90 wt \% of the
   asphaltenes self-associated. Ultrahigh resolution spectrometry suggests
   that the nonassociated asphaltenes are smaller and more aromatic than
   bulk asphaltenes indicating that the associating species are larger and
   less aromatic. On the basis of VPO, the average monomer molecular weight
   was approximately 850 g/mol, while the molecular weight of the
   nanoaggregates spanned a range of at least 30000 g/mol with an average
   on the order of 10000 to 20000 g/mol. SAXS and DLS gave molecular
   weights 10 times larger. The physical dimensions of the nanoaggregates
   were less than 20 nm based on nanofiltration and with average diameters
   of 5 to 9 nm based on diffusion and Rayleigh scattering. SAXS and DLS
   gave average diameters of 14 nm and indicated that the nanoaggregates
   had loose structures. Film studies were consistent with the lower
   molecular weights and dimensions and also demonstrated that asphaltene
   monolayers swell by a factor of 4 in the presence of a solvent. The most
   consistent interpretation of the data is that asphaltenes form a highly
   polydisperse distribution of loosely structured (porous or low fractal
   dimension) nanoaggregates. However, the discrepancy between VPO and SAXS
   molecular weights remains unresolved.}},

Abstract = {{Immediately after implantation, a dynamic process of bone formation and
   resorption takes place around an orthopaedic implant, influencing its
   mechanical fixation. The delay until complete fixation depends on local
   bone architecture and metabolism. Despite its importance, the temporal
   pattern of implant fixation is still unknown. The optimal duration of
   post-operative care is therefore difficult to establish for an
   individual situation, and a method to evaluate non-invasively the
   evolution of the mechanical stability would be a significant asset in a
   clinical environment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
   potential of micro-finite element modelling based on in vivo
   micro-computed tomography to monitor longitudinally the contact between
   bone and implant and the implant strength in vivo. The model was first
   validated for screw pull-out in synthetic bone surrogate. Correlation
   coefficients of R-2=0.94 and 0.85 (p<0.01) were measured between
   experimental and numerical results for stiffness and failure loads,
   respectively. Then, the mechanical integration of screws in the proximal
   tibia of 12 rats was monitored at seven time points over a period of
   1month. We observed significant increases (p<0.05) of bone-screw contact
   (+28\%), stiffness (+93\%) and failure load (+71\%) over the course of
   the experiment, and more than 75\% of these changes occurred during the
   first 2 weeks. Limitations, such as image artefacts and radiation, still
   compromise the immediate clinical application of this method, but it has
   a promising potential in preclinical animal studies, as it provides very
   valuable data about the dynamic aspect of implant integration with
   considerably reduced animal resources.}},

Abstract = {{This work establishes an effective approach to predict pore pressure in
   the overpressured Montney shale and overburden from sonic logs by
   implementing normal-trend and explicit methods. The cause of the
   overpressure condition in the Montney is also addressed. These two
   methods were selected on the basis of the study carried out by Contreras
   et al. (2012) that worked successfully for pore pressure prediction
   under subpressured conditions in parts of the western Canada sedimentary
   basin (WCSB). As a second objective, the stress-faulting regime was
   determined in the study area by use of stress polygons and data from
   diagnostic fracture-injection-test analysis as a quantification of the
   minimum horizontal stress. This is of paramount importance because there
   is not a generic theory explaining the stress-faulting regime for most
   of the western region of the WCSB.
   The Eaton method from sonic logs (Eaton 1975) and the Bowers method
   (Bowers 1995) were implemented in two vertical wells drilled through the
   Montney shale. The first part of the analysis considered two normal
   compaction trends, but unreasonable pressure profiles were obtained and
   required a revision on the depositional environment. It was found that
   for the study area, three normal compaction trends have to be
   considered. The Bowers method was initially implemented using both
   loading and unloading conditions in order to establish a safe range of
   pore pressure to allow successful well plans.
   It is concluded that undercompaction could be masked as the only
   overpressure mechanism in the Montney shale in the study area. The
   formation experiences an inverse faulting regime that will lead to the
   creation of horizontal hydraulic fractures. The Eaton method using three
   normal compaction trends and an exponent equal to 0.9 works successfully
   in the study area. The Bowers method uses the loading and the unloading
   conditions, and the specific correlation parameters were found to be
   suitable for the study area and can be extrapolated to adjacent future
   production and exploratory wells.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate predictions of heavy-oil and bitumen viscosity as a function of
   temperature, pressure, and composition are required for the design of
   thermal and solvent-based recovery methods. In this case study, the
   applicability of the recently developed Expanded Fluid (EF) viscosity
   model is tested on measured viscosities of diluted dead and live heavy
   oil and bitumen at temperatures from 20 to 175 degrees C and pressures
   up to 10 MPa. Density and viscosity data were collected for a condensate
   solvent, dead (gas-free) bitumen, and dead heavy oil from western
   Canada, and for the corresponding live oils and diluted mixtures of the
   dead and live oils with condensate solvent. Solubility, density, and
   viscosity data for heavy oil saturated with carbon dioxide (CO2) were
   obtained from the literature.
   The model was fitted to the data of the dead oils and the condensate
   with average relative deviations less than 11\%. The viscosity of the
   live bitumen and heavy oil was then predicted to within 21 and 31\% of
   the measured value on the basis of measured and calculated live-oil
   densities, respectively. Diluting the live and dead bitumen with 3 to 30
   wt\% condensate or carbon dioxide reduced the viscosity by one to three
   orders of magnitude, and the viscosities were predicted with an average
   relative deviation less than 16 and 24\% on the basis of measured and
   calculated mixture densities, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Interface management (IM) is one of the major keys for construction
   project success. The severity of interface problems for different
   projects does not only delay the project, but also impacts overall
   project performance. This paper is an extension of a previous work that
   defined major IM problems in Alberta's construction projects. This
   research study intended to investigate, identify, and classify interface
   problem factors in Alberta's construction projects. The study included
   four stages. The first stage was a comprehensive literature review,
   pilot studies and face-to-face interviews in industry. In the second
   phase, a web-page questionnaire was conducted with participants from
   industry. Based on that, in the last two phases, a factor analysis and
   Pearson's correlation matrix were applied on the collected data. The
   study identified six IM factors, namely: ``management{''},
   ``information, bidding and contracting{''}, ``by-law and regulation{''},
   ``technical engineering and site issues{''}, and ``other interface
   problems{''}. Finally, correlation between IM factors and different
   construction data was tested. The data analysis results provided a
   comprehensive view of the main causes behind IM conflicts in Alberta's

Journal = {{CLINICAL JOURNAL OF SPORT MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{23}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To develop a computerized visual analog scale (cVAS) system
   and determine if it could be used in place of the traditional 100-mm
   paper-based visual analog scale (pVAS) method for the measurement of
   pain in patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS).
   Design: Descriptive laboratory study.
   Setting: Biomechanics laboratory.
   Participants: Thirty-six runners diagnosed with PFPS.
   Interventions: A cVAS system was custom-coded for this study.
   Participants completed both the cVAS survey and a pVAS survey that
   measured usual knee pain during running, walking, prolonged sitting,
   stair ascent, stair descent, and squatting movements. Thus, 216 paired
   measurements were made in total.
   Main Outcome Measures: Pearson correlation coefficients and slopes of
   the line of best fit were calculated to assess the relationship between
   cVAS and pVAS scores, and Bland-Altman plots were constructed to
   determine cVAS agreement to pVAS scores.
   Results: All cVAS measures were highly correlated to pVAS scores (all r
   values were >0.9), and slopes were always near 1.0. Bland-Altman plots
   demonstrated that there was good agreement between the 2 methods.
   Conclusions: The cVAS system that was developed is a valid method for
   measurement of pain in patients with PFPS. Further use of the cVAS for
   studies involving PFPS is supported.}},

   dual-band transmitter. In the presence of 4.87 samples time-misalignment
   existing between the two input signals, the proposed method achieves
   normalized mean square error of -40 dB and adjacent channel power ratio
   improvement of about 15 dB in the dual bands. Further experiment shows
   the proposed 2-D predistorter outperforms 2D-GMP in terms of complexity

Abstract = {{Selective assembly is an important step during the manufacturing process
   for a complex product to meet precision requirements. The high precision

   capability index calculation and matchable degree calculation. The model
   can be applied to evaluate and improve product, process and system
   design at early development stages, or support the improvement of
   matchable degree for a complex production selective assembly process. In
   this model, we have introduced a navel concept of general matchable

Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1637-1646}},

Abstract = {{Industry and researchers have begun to shift their focus towards more
   sustainable and eco-friendly manufacturing processes in recent years.
   They have recognized the vital role of functional micro surfaces for a
   wide range of advanced applications to address this issue. By physically
   altering the surface structure of a material in micrometric scale,
   tribological, optical, fluidic properties and many other surface
   characteristics can be altered. Several researchers have reported that
   micro surface patterns can reduce friction between lubricated sliding
   surfaces, which in turn alleviate energy consumption and increase
   service life of components. Micro ball end milling is another viable
   technique for creating patterned surfaces, especially for metallic
   parts. By tilting the spindle and tool at an inclined angle, the spindle
   speed and feed rate can be adjusted so that the flutes of the cutter
   create periodic patterns in a workpiece surface. Machining is an
   efficient and versatile manufacturing technique, making the micro dimple
   machining technique an ideal method to fabricate dimpled surfaces. In
   this study, the fabricated surfaces are evaluated at a tribological
   level to illustrate their effectiveness at reducing friction. The
   development of efficient methods to produce micro patterns onto large
   surface areas can promote a sustainable future for a variety of novel
   products. The development of efficient surface pattern algorithms for
   generating different dimple geometries is also a focus; and, trends in
   cutting forces are identified by changing different machining
   parameters. Depth of cut and dimple shape, spacing and arrangement are
   crucial parameters, all of which factor into the performance of a
   functional surface. The results of this study strongly indicate micro
   dimple machining as an environmentally sustainable method of producing
   functional surfaces for advanced technological applications.}},

   operator characteristic curves were used to determine predictive value.
   The effect of the phase at which defibrillation shocks were applied was
   also determined.
   Results: No measure was able to classify whether a particular shock
   would be successful. All performed very poorly. Shock timing played no
   role in defibrillation outcome.
   Conclusions: Signal organization of a local electrogram and phase of
   shock delivery do not relate to minimum defibrillation shock energy
   immediately after ventricular fibrillation onset.}},

Abstract = {{Price argued that the average scientific specialty consists of about 100
   scientists, publishing an average 100 articles each during their career.
   Wray recently attempted to revise the number of scientists in a
   specialty based on the information that the average scientist publishes
   only 3.5 papers during their career. However, his final estimate,
   between 250 and 600 scientists, does not support Price's idea that a
   specialty fills about 10,000 articles, unless the ad hoc assumption is
   made that nearly 80 \% of articles circulating in a field are from other
   fields. This article shows that by distinguishing between graduate
   students, who spend only a couple of years in a specialty, and
   professors, who spend their entire career in a field, the ad hoc
   assumption becomes unnecessary, and Wray's number of 600 scientists
   turns out to be a remarkable intuitive insight that is consistent with
   Price's 10,000 articles. A number of 520 scientists, or somewhat larger,
   is suggested for Price's estimate.}},

Abstract = {{Despite extensive studies of inclusions with simple shape, little effort
   has been devoted to inclusions of irregular shape. In this study, we
   consider an inclusion of irregular shape embedded within an infinite
   isotropic elastic matrix subject to antiplane shear deformations. The
   inclusion-matrix interface is assumed to be imperfect characterized by a
   single, non-negative, and constant interface parameter. Using complex
   variable techniques, the analytic function that is defined within the
   irregular-shaped inclusion is expanded into a Faber series, and in
   conjunction with the Fourier series, a set of linear algebraic equations
   for a finite number of unknown coefficients is determined. With this
   approach and without imposing any constraints on the stress
   distribution, a semi-analytical solution is derived for the elastic
   fields within the irregular-shaped inclusion and the surrounding matrix.
   The method is illustrated using three examples and verified, when
   possible, with existing solutions. The results from the calculations
   reveal that the stress distribution within the inclusion is highly
   non-uniform and depends on the inclusion shape and the weak mechanical
   contact at the inclusion/matrix boundary. In fact, the results
   illustrate that the imperfect interface parameter significantly
   influences the stress distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Polymeric carbon nanotube (CNT) nanocomposites have unique mechanical,
   electrical, and thermal properties. Anisotropy can be induced depending
   on the alignment of the CNT fillers within polymeric composites, which
   is known to affect material properties. In order to investigate the
   effects of CNT alignments in micromechanical scribing using a single
   crystal diamond tool, a microindenter-scriber system was developed.
   Multiwalled carbon nanotube-polystyrene (MWCNT-PS) samples with varying
   CNT concentrations were prepared through a microinjection molding
   process, where the injection enables the partial alignment of CNTs in
   the flow direction through high shear stress. A mechanistic scribing
   force model was proposed based on the material properties that could be
   obtained using the microindentation techniques. Scribing experiments
   were performed in the parallel and perpendicular directions to the CNT
   alignment. Forces in three axes were measured and analyzed to identify
   three unknown parameters-the shearing, plowing, and adhesion friction
   coefficients. The resulting coefficients for scribing perpendicular to
   the CNT alignment showed distinguishable trends from scribing parallel
   to the CNT alignment as the CNT loadings increased. Their linear trends
   in relation to the material properties identified from indentation
   techniques can be used to predict microscribing parameters and resulting
   cutting forces, in combination with the proposed mechanistic model.}},

Abstract = {{Fluid forces are strong modulators of cell fate and fundamental

   differentiation. Here, we investigated the effects of fluid forces on
   murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs) in the absence of Leukemia
   Inhibitory Factor (LIF) using parallel-plate flow chambers. Cells were
   seeded onto gelatin-coated glass slides and grown for 2.5 days before
   exposure to fluid forces. Pluripotency marker gene expression was
   quantified by qPCR. An average shear stress of 0.6 Pa applied for 24 h
   in the absence of LIF and presence of high molecular weight dextran
   increased Oct4 and Sox2, decreased Nanog, and did not change in Rex1
   mRNA levels in comparison to statically cultured cells in the presence
   of LIF. At 0.3 Pa shear stress, Oct4 and Sox2 expression increased, with
   a reduction in Nanog and Rex1 levels. The presence of pulsation
   significantly increased expression of Rex1 and Nanog, but not expression
   of Oct4 or Sox2, compared to cells exposed to steady flow for 24 h. This
   study suggests incorporation of high cell-cell contact, viscosity
   elevation with dextran, moderate shear stress (0.6 Pa), and the presence

   maintenance of pluripotency.}},

   2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid was further chosen to evaluate the impact

   The degradation of 2,4-D under LED irradiation (365nm) was compared with
   that using mercury discharge lamp irradiation (350nm). Irradiation of
   the different pesticides with a 365-nm LED light source led to their
   complete mineralization upon prolonged exposure. The degradation rate
   was slower when mixtures of pesticides were used because of competition
   between pesticide molecules for adsorption sites, hydroxyl radicals, and
   holes. A suitable photocatalyst loading was determined to be of ; a
   linear relationship between the first-order kinetic rate and light
   intensity (2.7 to approximately 46.5mW) was observed. A comparison
   between LEDs and conventional mercury discharge lamps indicated that the

Abstract = {{The increasing availability of sensor devices has resulted in important
   volumes of sensor data, which has raised the issue of making these data
   fully discoverable and interpretable by applications and end-users. The
   idea of OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) has addressed this issue by
   proposing a set of standards to enable accessibility of sensor data over
   the Web. Similarly, there is a growing interest in volunteered
   geographic information (VGI). Considering that several researchers have
   highlighted the potential of this new type of information as a
   complement to existing, ``traditional{''} data, it becomes important to
   develop frameworks to support the integration of VGI from several
   sources and with other types of data. In this paper, we make a first
   step in this direction by proposing a framework for the semantic
   interoperability of sensor data and VGI. After having performed an
   investigation of the types of VGI applications, we have developed a
   conceptual model of VGI aligned with relevant ISO standards for
   describing geospatial features. The purpose of this model is to support
   the generation of common descriptions for VGI applications, which will
   act as interfaces to higher-level services, such as discovery and
   reasoning services, in order to be exploited in conjunction with sensor
   data by client applications. This process is described through
   architecture for semantic interoperability of sensor data and VGI that
   we have developed and that we intend to use to set guidelines for future
   research on integration of VGI in sensor data cyberinfrastructures. We
   illustrate the possibilities created by the proposed framework with a
   description of the various services and interfaces required to implement
   the framework.}},

Abstract = {{Ancillary services are the mechanisms power grids use to address
   short-term variability in supply and demand as well as the impact of
   power plant or transmission line failures. Organizations providing such
   services can earn revenue or at least reduce their energy costs. This
   paper explores options for large data centres to reduce costs in this
   way. Simulation results are presented for a system that models the
   processing of a workload and the resulting energy use, focusing on the
   impact of providing specific types of ancillary services. Trace data
   recording the workload from three supercomputing facilities along with
   pricing information from a US-based electrical grid are used. Results
   presented show energy costs reduced by up to 12\% with only a small
   impact on the quality of service provided to users of the data centre.
   Further reductions in energy costs are shown for data centres willing to
   cede more control over short-term energy consumption. The potential of
   ancillary services markets are compared against following-the-renewables
   approaches, using wind farm data to argue why providing ancillary
   services may be more effective than optimizing operations based on the
   production of local renewables. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper is intended to investigate how one can improve the overall
   energy efficiency of an ammonia process. A gas turbine is integrated
   with the process to reduce the exergy loss associated with ammonia
   synthesis loop and produce electricity. Combined Pinch and Exergy
   Analysis is applied to identify how exergy loss is distributed
   throughout heat transfer process. This is needed to find appropriate
   placement for gas turbine integration. Having introduced an exergy loss
   index for the whole plant, including the heat transfer process and gas
   turbine system, optimum shaftwork can be generated through recovering
   part of the exergy loss. Eventually, heat integration of the process
   streams is done to reduce additional consumption of high pressure steam
   caused by temperature drop in gas turbine. The results show that 4 MW of
   electricity can be produced in exchange of adding 7350 kW of high
   pressure steam. Total amount of exergy loss is reduced by 3323 kW, which
   indicates 19\% reduction compared to the existing process. Based on the
   economic data, the net income is estimated to be 2,549,653 US\$/y with 3
   years payback. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{105-113}},

Abstract = {{The adverse in-flow conditions for a very low head (VLH) water turbine
   have been investigated using a non-rotating turbine model. The aim of
   the study was to develop a better understanding of the three-dimensional
   flow generated upstream of the turbine by a step-like obstacle for
   varying turbine angles and spacings. Through flow-rate measurements,
   velocity-profile measurements and dye visualizations, the coupled
   effects between the turbine model and the varied in-flow geometry could
   be quantified. It was observed that the flow generated by the
   backward-facing step produced vortical structures that were found to
   corkscrew from the lower channel walls towards the mid-plane of the
   flow. These spanwise vortical structures were present through the
   interaction of the turbine model with the backward-facing step geometry
   for shorter cavity lengths. The coupled effects between model and step
   were found to be most pronounced for small turbine spacings on the order
   of one turbine diameter or less. Also significant velocity variations in
   the spanwise direction were observed in the cavity-like geometry.
   Finally, some preliminary results obtained from a rotating model are
   provided for comparison with the non-rotating model. Similar trends in
   terms of optimal spacing were observed, suggesting that a non-rotating
   model can be used for the preliminary experimental optimization of such
   three-dimensional cavity-like flows. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Journal = {{FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{113}},
Pages = {{34-40}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The rate of gasification can be increased by the addition of an alkali
   metal catalyst such as potassium. The effectiveness of potassium,
   however, depends on the characteristics of the feed material and the
   operating conditions. In this study, the effect of total pressure and
   partial CO2 pressure on the gasification rate of K-impregnated petroleum
   coke was studied. Both raw petroleum coke and the produced char were
   impregnated with potassium carbonate at different loadings (0.03, 0.06,
   0.10, 0.16 K/C molar ratio). The CO2 gasification experiments were
   performed in a high-pressure thermogravimetric analyzer at different
   temperatures (998 to 1098 K) and pressures (0.1 to 2.1 MPa), while the
   samples were characterized with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
   and inductively coupled plasma analysis. The rate increased with
   increasing pressure because of decreased catalyst volatilization and
   increased catalyst distribution. The determined activation energies at
   0.1 MPa were 254 +/- 21 kJ/mol and 133 +/- 17 kJ/mol, for K-impregnated
   char and petroleum coke, respectively. The impregnation of potassium was
   more effective on raw petroleum coke because petroleum coke had more
   surface functional groups and a less ordered crystal structure than
   char. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   The approach was tested on water/alcohol and gasoline/alcohol mixtures.
   Each mixture was distilled at atmospheric pressure. For the
   water/alcohol mixtures, the NRTL model was tuned to fit atmospheric
   distillation data by adjusting the interaction parameters (interaction
   energies and non-randomness factor). For the gasoline/alcohol mixtures,
   the gasoline was characterized from a GC hydrocarbon analysis and the
   advanced Peng-Robinson equation of state was tuned to atmospheric
   distillation data by adjusting the interaction parameters between the
   gasoline pseudo-components and the alcohols. The models, tuned only to
   distillation data, correctly predicted the phase behavior of these
   non-ideal mixtures including azeotropism. The model is entirely general

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is
   developed to investigate the influence of geometric and operating
   parameters on performance of a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC).
   Semi-empirical relationships are introduced to describe the
   electrochemical behaviors required in the CFD governing equations.
   Coefficients in these semi-empirical relationships are fitted using
   experimental data. Two geometric configurations with serpentine channels
   at the anode and cathode are considered in this work. Temperature,
   methanol concentration, and methanol flow rate are selected as the
   operating parameters. Due to the computational effort of CFD, an
   adaptive metamodeling method is developed to reduce the number of
   data-fitting iterations for obtaining the coefficients in the
   semi-empirical relationships. The effectiveness of the method is
   demonstrated by fitting the model using the experimental data collected
   from the first geometric configuration of the DMFC and comparing the
   predicted performance of the second configuration with its experimental
   performance. A commercial CFD system, Fluent 12.0, was used in this
   research. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Abstract = {{This study developed mathematic models to convert ultraviolet-visible
   absorbance (UV/Vis) of bio-solublized coal to conversion ratios. By a
   mathematic regression method, the results showed that they had strong
   linear relationships. The highest correlation coefficient (0.99531) of
   the linear relationship between UV/Vis absorbance and coal
   bio-solubilization ratios was obtained at the wavelength of 513 nm. The
   high correlation coefficient further indicated that the use of UV/Vis
   with the proposed mathematic model would be an easier, quicker, and more
   accurate measurement, as compared with the conventional measurement of
   weighing coal loss after bio-solubilization.}},

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{A major advancement in the research area of space vector modulation
   (SVM) in recent years is the introduction of the nearest three vector
   algorithm. Nonetheless, computational intensity is still a drawback of
   SVM methods in real time applications, especially in the case of
   multilevel inverter operation. A very fast and scalable SVM algorithm is
   introduced in this study, referred to as the fixed coordinate
   sub-triangle SVM (FCST-SVM) approach. The proposed method permits the
   determination of switch states and efficient calculation of switch
   on-time durations for a given N-level inverter topology. Calculations
   are performed based on a proposed sub-triangle approach with fixed
   coordinates in the space vector diagram. Avoiding calculating the
   coordinates of the nearest three voltage vectors is a significant
   advantage of the proposed algorithm compared with previous SVM
   approaches applied to multilevel inverters. An example of the
   application of this method is presented for the multilevel cascaded
   H-bridge inverter when non-constant isolated DC sources are subjected to
   random voltage deviations. MATLAB simulation results verify the
   feasibility of the proposed approach. Experimental results, using a
   TMS320F2812 digital signal processor, are also presented to verify the
   effectiveness of the proposed approach in decreasing the computational
   overhead in comparison with the conventional SVM method. For example, it
   is found that computational requirements for SVM decrease by a factor of
   9.5 compared with the conventional method in the case of a three-phase
   nine-level cascaded H-bridge inverter.}},

Journal = {{CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{56}},

Abstract = {{Background: Surgical simulators provide a safe environment to learn and
   practise psychomotor skills. A goal for these simulators is to achieve
   high levels of fidelity. The purpose of this study was to develop a
   reliable surgical simulator fidelity questionnaire and to assess whether
   a newly developed virtual haptic simulator for fixation of an ulna has
   comparable levels of fidelity as Sawbones.
   Methods: Simulator fidelity questionnaires were developed. We performed
   a stratified randomized study with surgical trainees. They performed
   fixation of the ulna using a virtual simulator and Sawbones. They
   completed the fidelity questionnaires after each procedure.
   Results: Twenty-two trainees participated in the study. The reliability
   of the fidelity questionnaire for each separate domain (environment,
   equipment, psychological) was Cronbach alpha greater than 0.70, except
   for virtual environment. The Sawbones had significantly higher levels of
   fidelity than the virtual simulator (p < 0.001) with a large effect size
   difference (Cohen d < 1.3).
   Conclusion: The newly developed fidelity questionnaire is a reliable
   tool that can potentially be used to determine the fidelity of other
   surgical simulators. Increasing the fidelity of this virtual simulator
   is required before its use as a training tool for surgical fixation. The
   virtual simulator brings with it the added benefits of repeated, in
   dependent safe use with immediate, objective feedback and the potential
   to alter the complexity of the skill.}},

Abstract = {{A major barrier to the acceptance of small wind turbines is that they
   are perceived to be noisy. This paper investigates an aspect of noise
   emission that has not been considered; vibration and noise generation
   from the tower. First, vibration measurements were made using
   accelerometers placed on the 10.2 m monopole tower of a Skystream 2.4 kW
   wind turbine, and natural frequencies and corresponding deflection
   shapes were calculated. Second, the results from the survey were used to
   verify the predictions of a finite element model of the tower structure.
   Lastly, the tower's acoustic emission was simulated computationally, as
   it was not possible to measure it accurately. Most vibration energy
   occurred in the very low frequency band (<= 10 Hz). It was found that
   wind itself can only excite the first two bending modes. On the other
   hand, emitted noise from the tower at large distances can be neglected,
   as close to the tower, the noise can reach 30 dB.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the abundance of solar energy, solar cells are considered as a
   renewable source of energy to replace conventional fossil fuels.
   Compared to the silicon-based photovoltaic (PV) cell, the next
   generation dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) offers the advantages of
   increased absorption of visible light, high efficiency potential, less
   energy intensive and lower-cost manufacturing process, colorable design,
   and lightweight material options. DSSC is a photo-electrochemical system
   that is based on a photosensitive dye-sensitized semiconductor (mostly
   titanium dioxide, TiO2) anode and an iodide-based electrolyte. In order
   to improve the performance of current DSSC systems, we proposed various
   design improvement schemes through the use of TiO2 nanotube (TONT)
   arrays and a multistack design of single cells. Through design
   modifications, approximately 38\% improvement in the performance
   compared to conventional DSSC is reported. Moreover, optical
   enhancements to increase the amount of incident light on the cell were
   applied to DSSCs to further improve its performance by application of
   Fresnel lenses on top of the DSSC and the use of light reflecting
   material such as Aluminum on the rear side of the cell. The polarization
   curves for different designs were measured using a potentiostat and the
   performance of each cell was compared. Optical enhancements improved the
   power output by 27\% compared to normal cells. A semi-empirical DSSC
   model was also developed based on the experimental results and the
   change in the performance of different designs was examined. Based on
   the model, the necessary conditions for maximum performance could be
   determined.}},

Abstract = {{Buoyancy-driven hydrodynamic instabilities of a miscible reactive

   The effects of the chemical reaction and a transverse flow parallel to

   concentration gradients tend to develop and advance fast downward
   leading to higher rates of chemical production. Furthermore, a detailed

Abstract = {{It is well-known that many unconventional reservoirs experience porosity
   and permeability changes with pressure change during production. In
   recent work, authors have incorporated geomechanical modeling into
   production-analysis procedures to account for stress sensitivity of
   permeability of unconventional gas reservoirs, such as shale gas. Such
   corrections are necessary both for deriving accurate estimates of
   reservoir and hydraulic-fracture properties from rate-transient analysis
   (RTA) and for developing accurate long-term forecasts.
   It is possible with some shale-gas reservoirs that dynamic changes may
   occur in both the induced hydraulic fracture and matrix permeability,
   which could have a substantial impact on shale-gas productivity. The
   stress dependence of shale-gas permeability has been quantified in the
   laboratory by several researchers, but measurements of this kind for
   propped or unpropped fractures under in-situ conditions are less
   routinely acquired. For the latter, a variety of mechanisms, caused in
   part or wholly by stress changes in the induced hydraulic fracture,
   could lead to conductivity changes.
   In the current work, we investigate the impact of both stress-dependent
   matrix permeability and fracture-conductivity changes on rate-transient
   signatures and derived reservoir and hydraulic-fracture properties.
   Stress-dependent matrix permeability is incorporated into RTA by use of
   modified pseudopressure and pseudotime formulations, and
   fracture-conductivity changes are approximated by applying a
   time-dependent (dynamic) skin effect.
   We demonstrate that when RTA incorporates both matrix permeability
   changes and dynamic skin, the resulting rate-transient signature looks
   very similar to those of other shale plays (long-term transient linear
   flow). Uncorrected data appear to have a very short
   transient-linear-flow period, followed by apparent boundary-dominated
   flow. The impact of the applied corrections on the estimates of system
   permeability and fracture half-length is demonstrated, as is the impact
   on production forecasts.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental legislation, with its increasing pressure on the energy
   sector to control greenhouse gases, is a driving force to reduce CO2
   emissions. In this paper, pre-combustion CO2 capture through integration
   of a site utility system with an integrated gasification combined cycle
   (IGCC) is investigated as an option to provide a compressed CO2-rich
   stream from a process site for sequestration. This work presents a
   two-step procedure for integration and optimization of a site utility
   system with an IGCC plant: (i) screening and optimization of IGCC plant
   performance parameters; (ii) integration and optimization of the utility
   system of the site with the IGCC plant. In the first step, an
   optimization approach applies the results of screening studies based on
   rigorous simulation of the IGCC. Having fixed the inlet fuel flow rate,
   the IGCC design parameters (including oxygen consumption, diluent flow
   rate and turbine exit pressure) are optimized for maximum power
   generation. Energy flows between the IGCC and CO2 compression train are
   considered. In the second step, the economic and operating performance
   of the utility system integrated with the IGCC plant are modeled and
   optimized for minimum operating cost to find the most appropriate level

Abstract = {{Concerns about global warming have led governments to regulate CO2
   emissions, including through emissions caps, trading and penalties, thus
   creating economic incentives to reduce CO2 emissions. This paper
   presents a mathematical model based on a MINLP formulation to address
   the problem of CO2 emissions from large-scale sites in the process
   industries. The proposed approach considers the interactions between
   process units, associated heat exchanger networks and the site utility
   system. The CO2 emissions reduction strategies considered include
   retrofit of heat exchanger networks (HENS), operational optimization of
   the utility system and fuel switching. The mathematical model captures
   interactions between the HEN and the utility system; the optimization
   explores these interactions systematically within a superstructure of
   CO2 reduction options. The optimization objective is to determine
   suitable CO2-mitigation options for a given emissions reduction target
   and available capital for investment, taking carbon trading issues into
   account. The proposed approach is applied to a published industrial case
   study; the results demonstrate the applicability of the approach to
   finding cost-effective solutions for CO2 emissions reduction. Results
   show that the best solution CO2 emissions reduction is affected by
   carbon trading. Therefore, opportunities to sell CO2 allowances, if
   practically achievable, play an important role in the process economics.

Abstract = {{The current study is an initial step towards the full characterization
   of coherent structures within the turbulent atmospheric boundary layer
   (ABL). A conditional-analysis technique to identify spanwise vortices is
   applied on data acquired throughout January-August 2012. This study
   begins with an approximation of the ABL stability and thickness (delta).
   Subsequently the measured Reynolds stresses are compared to those
   measured by Klebanoff (1955) over a flat plate and similarity
   formulations developed by Marusic and Kunkel (2003). The ABL data is
   shown to be neutral with a thickness of approximately 1000 m. The
   statistical descriptors of the turbulent fluctuations are found to
   qualitatively agree with Klebanoff (1955) and Marusic and Kunkel (2003).
   From the conditional analysis, it is found that the height of spanwise
   vortices follows a Rayleigh-like distribution with a mean and standard
   deviation of 0.065 delta and 0.038 delta, respectively. The circulation
   distribution of spanwise vortices is found to be bimodal about Gamma/U-0
   delta=0 with a standard deviation of 0.036U(0)delta. The magnitude of
   the positive peak of the bimodal distribution tends to be 80-100\% that
   of the negative peak, which demonstrates that prograde vortices are more
   frequent than retrograde vortices. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Oil-sands reservoirs in western Canada hold more than 170 billion bbl of
   recoverable heavy oil and bitumen representing a significant source of
   unconventional oil. At in-situ conditions, the majority of this oil has
   essentially no initial mobility because of its high viscosity, which is
   typically in the hundreds of thousands to millions of centipoises. In
   steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), steam injected into the
   formation heats oil at the edge of a depletion chamber, thus raising the
   mobility, k(0)/mu(0), of bitumen. Three main effects account for the
   increase of oil mobility. First, bitumen at steam temperature has
   viscosity typically less than 20 cp. Second, it is believed that shear,
   which is caused by thermal-expansion gradients, dilates the oil sand and
   causes enhanced permeability. Third, dilation at the chamber edge leads
   to smaller residual oil saturation (ROS). Because the production rate of
   SAGD is directly tied to the drainage rate of mobilized oil at the
   chamber edge, the thermogeomechanics of the oil sand at the chamber edge
   is a control on the performance of SAGD. In this study, a novel SAGD
   formula is derived that accounts for thermogeomechanical effects at the
   edge of the chamber. This paper couples dilation effects arising from
   thermal expansion into an analytical model for SAGD oil rate. The
   results reveal that volumetric expansion at the edge of the chamber
   plays a significant role in enabling effective drainage of bitumen to
   the production well.}},

Abstract = {{Early fluid production and flowing pressure data gathered immediately
   after fracture stimulation of multifractured horizontal wells may
   provide an early opportunity to generate long-term forecasts in
   shale-gas (and other hydraulically fractured) reservoirs. These early
   data, which often consist of hourly (if not more frequent) monitoring of
   fracture/formation fluid rates, volumes, and flowing pressures, are
   gathered on nearly every well that is completed. Additionally, fluid
   compositions may be monitored to determine the extent of load fluid
   recovery, and chemical tracers added during stage treatments to evaluate
   inflow from each of the stages. There is currently debate within the
   industry of the usefulness of these data for determining the long-term
   production performance of the wells. ``Rules of thumb{''} derived from
   the percentage of load-fluid recovery are often used by the industry to
   provide a directional indication of well performance. More-quantitative
   analysis of the data is rarely performed; it is likely that the
   multiphase-flow nature of flowback and the possibility of early data
   being dominated by wellbore-storage effects have deterred many analysts.
   In this work, the use of short-term flowback data for quantitative
   analysis of induced-hydraulic-fracture properties is critically
   evaluated. For the first time, a method for analyzing water and gas
   production and flowing pressures associated with the flowback of
   shale-gas wells, to obtain hydraulic-fracture properties, is presented.
   Previous attempts have focused on single-phase analysis. Examples from
   the Marcellus shale are analyzed. The short (less than 48 hours)
   flowback periods were followed by long-term pressure buildups
   (approximately 1 month). Gas water production data were analyzed with
   analytical simulation and rate-transient analysis methods designed for
   analyzing multiphase coalbed-methane (CBM) data. This analogy is used
   because two-phase flowback is assumed to be similar to simultaneous flow
   of gas and water during long-term production through the fracture system
   of coal. One interpretation is that the early flowback data correspond
   to wellbore + fracture volume depletion (storage). It is assumed that
   fracture-storage volume is much greater than wellbore storage. This flow
   regime appears consistent with what is interpreted from the long-term
   pressure-buildup data, and from the rate-transient analysis of flowback
   data. Assuming further that the complex fracture network created during
   stimulation is confined to a region around perforation clusters in each
   stage, one can see that fluid-production data can be analyzed with a
   two-phase tank-model simulator to determine fracture permeability and
   drainage area, the latter being interpreted to obtain an effective
   (producing) fracture half-length given geometrical considerations. Total
   fracture half-length, derived from rate-transient analysis of online
   (post-cleanup) data, verifies the flowback estimates. An analytical
   forecasting tool that accounts for multiple sequences of post-storage
   linear flow, followed by late-stage boundary flow, was developed to
   forecast production with flowback-derived parameters, volumetric inputs,
   matrix permeability, completion data, and operating constraints. The
   preliminary forecasts are in very good agreement with online production
   data after several months of production. The use of flowback data to
   generate early production forecasts is therefore encouraging, but needs
   to be tested for a greater data set for this shale play and for other
   plays, and should not be used for reserves forecasting.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Following a recent study by Giraldo et al. (Giraldo, C.; Maini, B.;
   Bishnoi, P. R A simplified approach to modeling the rate of formation of
   gas hydrates formed from mixtures of gases. Energy Fuels 2013, 27,
   1204-1211), in which a new stoichiometry-based approach was taken to
   model the rate of gas hydrate formation for mixed gases, a new
   stoichiometric approach has been proposed to describe the kinetics of
   gas hydrate decomposition from mixed gases. Similar to the model of gas
   hydrate formation by Giraldo et al., the newly proposed model of gas
   hydrate decomposition has the advantage that the intrinsic rate constant
   of gas hydrate decomposition is only required for a single component. To
   test the model, gas hydrate decomposition experiments were conducted in
   a semi-batch stirred-tank reactor, equipped with an in situ particle
   size analyzer, to study the rate of decomposition of gas hydrates formed
   from mixtures of carbon dioxide and methane. Two gas mixtures of CO2 (1)
   + CH4 (2), one with x(1) = 0.4 and the other with x(1) = 0.6, were used
   for the current study. The experimental temperatures ranged from 274 to
   276 K, and the experimental pressures ranged from 16 to 22 bar. The new
   approach was used to model the kinetics of gas hydrate decomposition,
   and the results from these predictions were compared to the results
   obtained using the model by Clarke and Bishnoi (Clarke, M. A.; Bishnoi,
   P. R. Measuring and modelling the rate of decomposition of gas hydrates
   formed from mixtures of methane and ethane. Chem. Eng. Sri. 2001, 56,

   between the predictions of the new model and the model by Clarke and
   Bishnoi are 4.15 and 6.21\%, respectively. Further validation of the new
   model was performed using it to fit the data by Clarke and Bishnoi on
   the decomposition of both sI and sII gas hydrates formed from mixtures
   of CH4 (1) + C2H6 (2). When applied to these data sets, the
   root-mean-square of the relative errors between the predictions of the

Abstract = {{The kinetics of K2CO3-catalyzed CO2 gasification of ash-free coal was
   investigated with a thermogravimetric analyzer and compared to raw coal
   and uncatalyzed ash-free coal. At 750 degrees C, the gasification of
   ash-free coal dry mixed with 20 wt \% K2CO3 was approximately 3 and 60
   times faster than the raw coal and ash-free coal without catalyst,
   respectively. Increasing the amount of catalyst from 20 to 45 wt \%
   increased the gasification rate 3-fold. The gasification rate of
   ash-free coal containing potassium catalyst strongly depended upon the
   pretreatment (i.e., heating gas atmosphere and heating time) because it
   directly affected the degree of catalyst reduction. The catalytic
   gasification behavior could only be predicted with the extended random
   pore model, whereas the random pore model and integrated model were
   essentially equal for fitting the gasification rate for raw and ash-free
   coal. The activation energy for the catalyzed ash-free coal gasification
   was approximately 100 kJ mol(-1) larger than for raw coal and the
   uncatalyzed ash-free coal. This increase might be due to the energy
   required for the potassium (i.e., catalyst) transfer to a new carbon
   site or caused by the pyrolysis process, because the formed char might
   have different properties.}},

Abstract = {{Periodic structural health monitoring of infrastructure systems is
   important to avoid economic losses and human casualties. Traditionally,
   deformation monitoring has been done through surveying techniques.
   Recently, with the increased availability of inexpensive off-the-shelf

   complete three-dimensional reconstruction of the object or surface of
   interest. This paper aims at combining two methodologies of
   photogrammetric reconstructionimage-matching-based reconstruction and
   model-based image fittingto achieve submillimeter precision for the
   estimation of both vertical deflections and horizontal displacements.
   The proposed methodology was tested with data collected using a
   photogrammetric system at a structures laboratory where a concrete beam
   was subjected to different loading conditions by a hydraulic actuator.
   The experimental results showed that the photogrammetric system was
   capable of monitoring both static and dynamic deformations. The
   methodology used exhibited a high level of automation and the final
   results yielded a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of half a millimeter.}},

Abstract = {{The solubility of the major constituents of natural gas in ionic liquids
   (ILs) can be used to identify their potential for acid gas removal from
   a producing gas stream. We have developed models for the solubility of
   H2S, CH4, and C2H6 in ILs at typical conditions encountered in natural
   gas treatment. In this work, a conductor-like screening model for
   realistic solvation was used to predict the activity coefficients for
   solutes in ILs and a cubic EOS was used for vapor-phase corrections from
   ideality. Empirical correlations were developed to extrapolate
   solubilities where experimental data are not available at desired
   conditions; targeted in this study at 298.15 K and 2000 kPa. Over 400
   possible ILs were ranked based on the higher selectivity of absorption
   of CO2 and H2S over CH4 and C2H6. The best 15\% (58) of promising ILs
   for sour gas treatment predominantly contain the anions BF4, NO3, and
   CH3SO4 and the cations N-4111, pmg, and tmg. (c) 2013 American Institute

Journal = {{CARBON}},

Abstract = {{The microstructure, electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding
   effectiveness (SE), DC electrical conductivity, AC electrical
   conductivity and complex permittivity of nanostructured polymeric
   materials filled with three different carbon nanofillers of different
   structures and intrinsic electrical properties were investigated. The
   nanofillers were multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), carbon nanofibers
   (CNF) and high structure carbon black (HS-CB) nanoparticles and the
   polymer was acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS). In addition, the EMI
   SE mechanisms and the relation between the AC electrical conductivity in
   the X-band frequency range and the DC electrical conductivity were
   studied. The nanocomposites were fabricated by solution mixing and
   characterized by uniform dispersion of the nanofillers within the
   polymer matrix. It was found that, at the same nanofiller loading, the
   EMI SE, permittivity and electrical conductivity of the nanocomposites
   decreased in the following order: MWCNT > CNF > CB. MWCNT based
   nanocomposites exhibited the lowest electrical percolation threshold and
   the highest EMI SE owning to the higher aspect ratio and electrical
   conductivity of MWCNT compared to CNF and HS-CB. The AC conductivity in
   the X-band frequency range was found to be independent of frequency. (C)

Journal = {{MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Inspection of a manufactured freeform surface can be conducted by
   building its surface model and comparing this manufactured surface model
   with the ideal design surface model and its tolerance requirement. The
   manufactured freeform surface model is usually achieved by obtaining
   measurement points on the manufactured surface, transforming these
   measurement points from the measurement coordinate system to the design
   coordinate system through localization, and reconstructing the surface
   model using the localized measurement points. In this research, a method
   was developed to estimate the locations and their variances of any
   selected points on the reconstructed freeform surface considering
   different sources of uncertainties in measurement, localization and
   surface reconstruction processes. In this method, first locations and
   variances of the localized measurement points are calculated considering
   uncertainties of the measurement points and uncertainties introduced in
   the localization processes. Then locations and variances of points on
   the reconstructed freeform surface are obtained considering
   uncertainties of the localized measurement points and uncertainties
   introduced in the freeform surface reconstruction process. Two case
   studies were developed to demonstrate how these three different
   uncertainty sources influence the quality of the reconstructed freeform
   curve and freeform surface in inspection.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a multi-feature based system calibration method for
   estimating the boresight angles of a land-based mobile mapping system
   (MMS) comprised of multiple two dimensional (2D) scanners. The method
   invokes a least-squares adjustment (LSA) to simultaneously estimate
   several sets of boresight angles for multiple laser scanners
   incorporated in an MMS as well as the parameters associated with one or
   more types of geometric features. This is achieved by constraining the
   groups of feature point clouds captured by multiple runs to fit their
   corresponding geometric models in such a way that the weighted sum of
   squares of adjustment residuals is minimized. The method is particularly
   suitable for in situ calibration because the geometric features involved
   are commonly occurring structures (e.g. building facades, bridge
   surfaces, highway signs and hanging power cables) that are usually
   captured during the actual survey. In addition to using a planar feature
   model for calibration, a novel and rigorous three-dimensional (3D)
   catenary curve model is proposed for geometric modelling of hanging
   cables to augment the calibration. The proposed calibrations were
   examined with several different combinations of groups of planar and
   catenary features and the resulting analysis suggests that the in situ
   calibrations are effective when compared to the manufacturer's dedicated
   calibration, with the overall point cloud accuracies for plane fitting
   being 5.5 cm and 5.4 cm for the vertical and horizontal directions,
   respectively. It has been successfully demonstrated that the proposed
   method can be used in a scene having no building facades but only some
   long hanging cables and horizontal ground surfaces. This is particularly
   useful for rural areas or inter-city/provincial highways where building
   fa ades cannot commonly be captured. Parameter correlations in the
   calibrations were also addressed. It has also been shown that using
   catenary features in addition to planar features for the calibration can
   help de-correlate some parameters and improve the overall accuracy. The
   in situ nature and the high flexibility of integrating different
   features of the calibration make the proposed method straightforward for
   most end-users. (c) 2013 International Society for Photogrammetry and

Abstract = {{Complex structures, such as machine tools, are comprised of several
   substructures connected to each other through joints to form the
   assembled structures. Joints can have significant contributions on the
   behavior of the overall assembly and ignoring joint effects in the
   design stage may result in considerable deviations from the actual
   dynamic behavior. The identification of joint dynamics enables us to
   accurately predict overall assembled dynamics by mathematically
   combining substructure dynamics through the equilibrium and
   compatibility conditions at the joint. The essence of joint
   identification is the determination of the difference between the
   measured overall dynamics and the rigidly coupled substructure dynamics.
   In this study, we investigate the inverse receptance coupling (IRC)
   method and the point-mass joint model, which considers the joint as
   lumped mass, damping and stiffness elements. The dynamic properties of
   the joint are investigated using both methods through a finite element
   (FE) simulation and experimental tests. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Surfactant flooding aims at lowering the interfacial tensions between

   presents adsorption equilibrium and kinetics of Zizyphus Spina Christi
   (ZSC), a new non-ionic surfactant, onto carbonate rocks. The adsorption
   tests were conducted at a temperature range of 28-75 degrees C. A
   conductivity method was employed in this study to measure CMC parameter
   and surfactant concentration in the aqueous solutions. The equilibrium
   conditions for the crushed rock samples were obtained after about 2
   days. According to the experimental results, the equilibrium data were
   well-fitted by the Freundlich isotherm for carbonate samples.
   Furthermore, the adsorption process is exothermic and obeys the
   second-order kinetic model. Such a systematic investigation is very
   helpful to select a proper surfactant for EOR application and reservoir

Journal = {{CORROSION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{150-160}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a finite element model was developed to study
   mechanoelectrochemical effect of pipeline corrosion through a
   multiphysics field coupling technique. The modeling results, i.e.,
   corrosion potential and corrosion current density, are well consistent
   with experimental measurements on pipeline steel in a near-neutral pH
   solution. It is demonstrated that, while a tensile strain enhances
   stress uniformly through pipe wall, an increasing depth of corrosion
   defect results in a concentrated stress at the defect center only. When
   the corrosion defect is under an elastic deformation, there is no
   apparent effect of mechanical-electrochemical interaction on corrosion.
   However, when the applied tensile strain or the geometry of corrosion
   defect is sufficient to cause a plastic deformation at the defect, the
   local corrosion activity is increased remarkably. Corrosion at the
   defect is composed of a series of local galvanic cells, where the region
   with a higher stress, such as the defect bottom, serves as anode, and
   that under lower stress, such as the defect sides, as cathode. The
   locally accelerated corrosion at the defect center can be further
   enhanced as the corrosion defect deepens. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

   convection-A case study of a replica Roman bath}},
Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{59-66}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Floor and wall subcutaneous convective heating is a common and efficient
   supplementary system of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning
   (HVAC) but the concept dates back nearly 2500 years to when ancient
   Greeks and Romans used it to warm their bathing facilities. This paper
   explores the thermal environment of a replica Roman bath resulting from
   purely subcutaneous convective heating by modelling the bath using
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Previous studies examining the
   interior of baths have used either heat fluxes or lumped-mass
   thermodynamics, but neither approach possesses the detail of CFD. The
   average temperature in the 3 m x 4 m room modelled is 35 degrees C;
   however, the hottest air is trapped in the high vault leaving the region
   inhabited by the patrons significantly cooler than the average. The
   results also show that stratification is prominent and that the open
   doorway connecting to the next room heavily influences the room
   temperature. The results also suggest a relative insensitivity to
   changes in the convective heat transfer coefficient and addition of
   humidity to the model. Furthermore, this study not only provides further
   knowledge about an alternative HVAC system but enhances our
   understanding of ancient Roman baths. In addition, it offers an insight
   to a unique thermal environment on the basis of multi-phase and species
   modelling. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Detection of Architectural Distortion in Prior Mammograms via Analysis
   of Oriented Patterns}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate methods for the detection of architectural distortion in
   prior mammograms of interval-cancer cases based on analysis of the
   orientation of breast tissue patterns in mammograms. We hypothesize that
   architectural distortion modifies the normal orientation of breast
   tissue patterns in mammographic images before the formation of masses or
   tumors. In the initial steps of our methods, the oriented structures in
   a given mammogram are analyzed using Gabor filters and phase portraits
   to detect node-like sites of radiating or intersecting tissue patterns.
   Each detected site is then characterized using the node value, fractal
   dimension, and a measure of angular dispersion specifically designed to
   represent spiculating patterns associated with architectural distortion.
   Our methods were tested with a database of 106 prior mammograms of 56
   interval-cancer cases and 52 mammograms of 13 normal cases using the
   features developed for the characterization of architectural distortion,
   pattern classification via quadratic discriminant analysis, and
   validation with the leave-one-patient out procedure. According to the
   results of free-response receiver operating characteristic analysis, our
   methods have demonstrated the capability to detect architectural
   distortion in prior mammograms, taken 15 months (on the average) before
   clinical diagnosis of breast cancer, with a sensitivity of 80\% at about
   five false positives per patient.}},

Title = {{A hybrid framework for reservoir characterization using fuzzy ranking

Abstract = {{Reservoir characterization refers to the process of quantitatively
   assigning reservoir properties using all available field data.
   Artificial neural networks (ANN) have recently been introduced to solve
   reservoir characterization problems dealing with the complex underlying
   relationships inherent in well log data. Despite the utility of ANNs,
   the current limitation is that most existing applications simply focus
   on directly implementing existing ANN models instead of
   improving/customizing them to fit the specific reservoir
   characterization tasks at hand. In this paper, we propose a novel
   intelligent framework that integrates fuzzy ranking (FR) and multilayer
   perceptron (MLP) neural networks for reservoir characterization. FR can
   automatically identify a minimum subset of well log data as neural
   inputs, and the MLP is trained to learn the complex correlations from
   the selected well log data to a target reservoir property. FR guarantees
   the selection of the optimal subset of representative data from the
   overall well log data set for the characterization of a specific
   reservoir property; and, this implicitly improves the modeling and
   predication accuracy of the MLP. In addition, a growing number of
   industrial agencies are implementing geographic information systems
   (GIS) in field data management; and, we have designed the GFAR solution
   (GIS-based FR ANN Reservoir characterization solution) system, which
   integrates the proposed framework into a GIS system that provides an
   efficient characterization solution. Three separate petroleum wells from
   southwestern Alberta, Canada, were used in the presented case study of
   reservoir porosity characterization. Our experiments demonstrate that
   our method can generate reliable results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This work presents a unifying framework to study energy-efficient
   optimal gaits for a bipedal model without elastic elements. The model
   includes a torso, flat feet, and telescoping legs, equipped with
   rotational hip and ankle joints. Two general types of gaits are studied:
   with and without a flight phase. The support surface can be level
   ground, sloped, or staircase. The algorithm achieves the optimum within
   the admissible space by using a minimal set of realistic physical
   constraints, and avoiding a priori assumptions on kinetic and kinematic
   parameters such as extended or instantaneous double-support, collisional
   or collisionless foot-ground contact, step length, step period, etc. The
   gait optimization for this simple model predicts many features of human
   locomotion including the optimality of pendular walking and impulsive
   running at slow and fast progression speeds, ankle push-off prior to
   touch-down, swing leg retraction, landing on a near vertical leg in
   gaits with flight phase, and burst hip torques at both ends of the swing

Abstract = {{We propose a new dissolution technique using a static mixer at the

   calibrated with the experimental data. These models are then used to
   scale-up the downhole dissolution and power dissipation. Results show
   that the static mixer can significantly improve the mass transfer
   between CO2 and water and decrease the length scale for mass transfer.
   It is also shown that the dissipated power for a field-scale application
   is only a small fraction of the required power for CO2 injection. These
   results will find application in optimum designing of a real-size static
   mixers and field-scale implementation of CO2 geological storage. (C)

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEODYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{68}},

Abstract = {{Gravity effect due to ocean tide loading (OTL) is an important signal
   and correction in various gravimetric applications. In this paper, we
   assessed the OTL gravity effects at four absolute gravity (AG) stations
   in coastal China from several perspectives. The integrated Green's
   function of the Newtonian part was derived analytically and that of the
   elastic part was computed based on the PREM earth model. Ocean tide (OT)
   records near the four AG stations were used to enhance the accuracy of
   the global ocean tide model of NA099b and the regional model of NA099jb
   for the innermost field (<0.02 degrees). The high-resolution digital
   elevation model (DEM) from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)
   was used to define the land-sea boundary in the optimized near field
   (<1.0 degrees). Results show that the high-resolution land-sea boundary
   is indispensible for OTL gravity modeling when the shoreline near a
   coastal station is complex. The SRTM-based OTL model outperforms the
   GMT-based model shoreline in terms of the agreement between modeled and
   observed gravity residuals at the four stations. The final gravity
   residuals, corrected for OIL, at the four stations are significantly
   smaller than those without OTL corrections. We give examples of accuracy
   requirements in coordinates at Qingdao for different station heights. At
   a station height of 80 m and to ensure a 0.1 mu gal accuracy in OTL
   modeling, the required accuracies in the horizontal and vertical
   coordinate are 2.5 and 1.3 m, respectively. For a new coastal station
   and an expected OTL accuracy, one should inspect the variation of OTL
   due to coordinate variation to find a best strategy to determine the
   required accuracy of coordinate. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this study, the treatment of brown type onion (Allium cepa L) waste
   was investigated under subcritical water conditions. Experiments were
   carried out in a wide temperature range from 373 to 593 K, at a
   residence time of 5 min. Several phases were segregated after the
   reaction, including the aqueous phase, solid residue, and hexane and
   acetone soluble phases. In the aqueous phase, significantly increased
   amounts of total organic carbon and total nitrogen were identified from
   the decomposition of mainly the carbohydrate and protein parts of the
   onion. In addition, very promising amounts of water-soluble sugars were
   also quantified in the aqueous phase (65\% of the dry matter for onion
   bulbs and 7\% for skins). For the remaining solid phases obtained at
   different temperatures, higher heating values (HHVs) were calculated and
   compared, based on the ultimate analysis. Generally, the remaining
   solids showed increased amounts of carbon content, which led to
   increased HHVs and energy densities of the solids. Acetone and hexane
   soluble fractions were also evaluated. Very small amounts of hexane and
   acetone soluble compounds were obtained. Furthermore, two valuable
   products - fructooligosaccharides and quercetin - were successfully
   obtained from onion bulbs and skins, respectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {{An evaluation of meniscal collagenous structure using optical projection
   tomography}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL IMAGING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{JUL 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: The collagenous structure of menisci is a complex network of
   circumferentially oriented fascicles and interwoven radially oriented
   tie-fibres. To date, examination of this micro-architecture has been
   limited to two-dimensional imaging techniques. The purpose of this study
   was to evaluate the ability of the three-dimensional imaging technique;
   optical projection tomography (OPT), to visualize the collagenous
   structure of the meniscus. If successful, this technique would be the
   first to visualize the macroscopic orientation of collagen fascicles in
   3-D in the meniscus and could further refine load bearing mechanisms in
   the tissue. OPT is an imaging technique capable of imaging samples on
   the meso-scale (1-10 mm) at a micro-scale resolution. The technique,
   similar to computed tomography, takes two-dimensional images of objects
   from incremental angles around the object and reconstructs them using a
   back projection algorithm to determine three-dimensional structure.
   Methods: Bovine meniscal samples were imaged from four locations (outer
   main body, femoral surface, tibial surface and inner main body) to
   determine the variation in collagen orientation throughout the tissue.
   Bovine stifles (n = 2) were obtained from a local abattoir and the
   menisci carefully dissected. Menisci were fixed in methanol and
   subsequently cut using a custom cutting jig (n = 4 samples per
   meniscus). Samples were then mounted in agarose, dehydrated in methanol
   and subsequently cleared using benzyl alcohol benzyl benzoate (BABB) and
   imaged using OPT.
   Results: Results indicate circumferential, radial and oblique
   collagenous orientations at the contact surfaces and in the inner third
   of the main body of the meniscus. Imaging identified fascicles ranging
   from 80-420 mu m in diameter. Transition zones where fascicles were
   found to have a woven or braided appearance were also identified. The
   outer-third of the main body was composed of fascicles oriented
   predominantly in the circumferential direction. Blood vessels were also
   visualized using this technique, as their elastin content fluoresces
   more brightly than collagen at the 425 nm wavelength used by the OPT
   scanner.
   Conclusions: OPT was capable of imaging the collagenous structure, as
   well as blood vessels in the bovine meniscus. Collagenous structure
   variability, including transition zones between structural regions not
   previously described in the meniscus, was identified using this novel
   technique.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report on a modeling study of an AC electrothermal
   (ACET) micropump with high operating pressures as well as fast flow
   rates. One specific application area is for fluid delivery using
   microneedle arrays which require higher pressures and faster flow rates
   than have been previously reported with ACET devices. ACET is very
   suitable for accurate actuation and control of fluid flow, since the
   technique has been shown to be very effective in high conductivity
   fluids and has the ability to create a pulsation free flow. However, AC
   electrokinetic pumps usually can only generate low operating pressures
   of 1 to 100 Pa, where flow reversal is likely to occur with an external
   load. In order to realize a high performance ACET micropump for
   continuous fluid delivery, applying relatively high AC operating
   voltages (20 to 36 V-rms) to silicon substrate ACET actuators and using
   long serpentine channel allows the boosting of operating pressure as
   well as increasing the flow rates. Fast pumping flow rates (10(2)-10(3)
   nl/s) and high operating pressures (1-12 kPa) can be achieved by
   applying both methods, making them of significant importance for
   continuous fluid delivery applications using microneedle arrays and
   other such biomedical devices. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Dispersion plays an important role in transport of contaminants and
   tracers in fractured aquifers. In this work we develop a model for the
   lumped mass transfer coefficient by including dispersion in the fracture
   network for slab-, cylindrical- and spherical-shapes of the aggregates
   for the immobile zone. Coupled transport equations of mobile and
   immobile zones are solved to develop a first-order lumped mass transfer
   coefficient. An equivalent fracture aperture, uniform rock matrix block
   size and constant volumetric water contents (mobile and immobile zones)
   with no adsorption/desorption are used to represent the aquifer. Results
   reveal that geometry of the rock matrix blocks and dispersivity have
   important effects on the upscaled mass transfer coefficient. It is found
   that field scale simulations of transport processes without including
   the dispersion in fractures are not valid for the whole range of
   practical injection rates (10(4) < Pe < 10(6)). However, modeling of
   laboratory scale experiments (less than one meter in length) without
   including dispersion in the mobile zone may be valid at high injection
   rates (Pe > 10(6)). It is confirmed that the upscaled lumped mass
   transfer coefficient is a function of scale and the rate of injection of
   the tracer. These findings will find applications in modeling of
   transport processes of contaminated sites remediation and waste
   disposal. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background In vitro chondrocyte expansion is a major challenge in
   cell-based therapy for human articular cartilage repair. Classical
   culture conditions usually use animal serum as a medium supplement,
   which raises a number of undesirable questions. In the present study,
   two kinds of defined, serum-free media were developed to expand
   chondrocytes in monolayer culture for the purpose of cartilage tissue
   engineering.
   Methods Bovine chondrocytes were expanded in serum-free media
   supplemented with fibroblast growth factor-2 and platelet-derived growth
   factor or fibroblast growth factor-2 and insulin-like growth factor.
   Expansion culture in a conventional 10\% fetal bovine serum (FBS) medium
   served as control. Fibronectin coating was used to help cell adhesion in
   serum-free medium. Next, in vitro three-dimensional pellet culture was
   used to evaluate the chondrocyte capacity. Cell pellets were expanded in
   different media to re-express the differentiated phenotype
   (re-differentiation) and to form cartilaginous tissue. The pellets were
   assessed by glycosaminoglycans contents, collagen II, collagen I and
   collagen X immunohistological staining.
   Results Chondrocytes cultured in serum-free media showed no
   proliferation difference than cells grown with 10\% FBS medium. In
   addition, chondrocytes expanded in both serum-free media expressed more
   differentiated phenotypes at the end of monolayer culture, as indicated
   by higher gene expression ratios of collagen type II to collagen type I.
   Pellets derived from chondrocytes cultured in both serum-free media
   displayed comparable chondrogenic capacities to pellets from cells
   expanded in 10\% FBS medium.
   Conclusion These findings provide alternative culture approaches for
   chondrocytes in vitro expansion, which may benefit the clinical use of
   autologous chondrocytes implantation.}},

Abstract = {{Wedged insoles may produce immediate effects on knee abduction angular
   impulses during running; however, it is currently not known whether
   these knee abduction angular impulse magnitudes are maintained
   throughout a run when fatigue sets in. If changes occur, this could
   affect the clinical utility of wedged insoles in treating conditions
   such as patellofemoral pain. Thus, the purpose of this study was to
   determine whether knee abduction angular impulses are altered during a
   prolonged run with wedged insoles. It was hypothesized that knee
   abduction angular impulses would be reduced following a prolonged run
   with wedged insoles. Nine healthy runners participated. Runners were
   randomly assigned to either a 6-mm medial wedge condition or a 6-mm
   lateral wedge condition and then ran continuously overground for 30min.
   Knee abduction angular impulses were quantified at 0 and 30min using a
   gait analysis procedure. After 2 days, participants returned to perform
   the same test but with the other wedge type. Two-way repeated-measures
   analysis of variance was used to evaluate main effects of wedge
   condition and time and interactions between wedge condition and time
   (=0.05). Paired t-tests were used for post hoc analysis (=0.01). No
   interaction effects (p=0.958) were found, and knee abduction angular
   impulses were not significantly different over time (p=0.384). Lateral
   wedge conditions produced lesser knee abduction angular impulses than
   medial conditions at 0min (difference of 2.79 N m s, p=0.006) and at
   30min (difference of 2.76 N m s, p < 0.001). It is concluded that
   significant knee abduction angular impulse changes within wedge
   conditions do not occur during a 30-min run. Additionally, knee
   abduction angular impulse differences between wedge conditions are
   maintained during a 30-min run.}},

Abstract = {{Strapdown inertial navigation systems (INS) need an alignment process to
   determine the initial attitude matrix between the body frame and the
   navigation frame. The conventional alignment process is to compute the
   initial attitude matrix using the gravity and Earth rotational rate
   measurements. However, under mooring conditions, the inertial
   measurement unit (IMU) employed in a ship's strapdown INS often suffers
   from both the intrinsic sensor noise components and the external
   disturbance components caused by the motions of the sea waves and wind
   waves, so a rapid and precise alignment of a ship's strapdown INS
   without any auxiliary information is hard to achieve. A robust solution
   is given in this paper to solve this problem. The inertial frame based
   alignment method is utilized to adapt the mooring condition, most of the
   periodical low-frequency external disturbance components could be
   removed by the mathematical integration and averaging characteristic of
   this method. A novel prefilter named hidden Markov model based Kalman
   filter (HMM-KF) is proposed to remove the relatively high-frequency
   error components. Different from the digital filters, the HMM-KF barely
   cause time-delay problem. The turntable, mooring and sea experiments
   favorably validate the rapidness and accuracy of the proposed
   self-alignment method and the good de-noising performance of HMM-KF.}},

Abstract = {{Reactive azo dyes are among the most applicable dyes in textile
   industries. However, these compounds are environmentally hazardous and
   difficult to treat by classical methods. In the present study a batch
   stirred photoreactor with a novel irradiating setup was utilized for
   decolorization of a reactive azo dye. The effects of certain parameters
   including initial dye, H2O2 concentration, photocatalyst loading and
   initial pH in a system consisting of UV/TiO2/H2O2 on the decolorization
   and degradation of C.I. Reactive Black 8 were investigated. Box-Behnken
   method, a statistical experimental design method, has been used to
   optimize the decolorization process. Decolorization efficiency increases
   with decreasing initial dye concentration, addition of H2O2 up to an
   optimum value, increasing photocatalyst loading and at original pH
   values (containing no pH adjusting chemicals).
   The optimum parameters for decolorization of Reactive Black 8 are
   obtained as follows: TiO2 = 1.59 g L-1, Reactive Black 8 concentration
   =34.65 ppm, pH = 5.5, H2O2 concentration = 1.82 (stoichiometric ratio).
   By use of these optimum parameters 96.1\% decolorization and 78.6\%
   degradation of the dye in the solution was observed within 60 minutes

Abstract = {{This paper presents results of an experimental study that systematically
   examined the propagation of nanodispersed catalyst suspension in
   sandpacks prepared with Athabasca reservoir sand and operated at the
   reservoir conditions. The concentration and size distribution of the
   particles at the injection and production end were measured. The
   pressure drops in different segments along length of the sandpack were
   monitored continuously. The retention behaviour of particles at the end
   of each experiment was examined by measuring the catalyst concentration
   in the bed as a function of the distance from the injection end of the
   sandpack and also by analysis of extracted samples using scanning
   electron microscopy.
   The results show that it is possible to propagate the nanodispersed
   catalyst suspension through sand beds without causing permeability
   damage, but a small fraction of the injected particles is retained in
   the sand. It was found that significantly higher retention occurs in the
   entrance region of the bed (compared with downstream regions) and that
   the total particle retention was higher in the Athabasca sand beds than
   in clean silica sand with the same flow and suspension properties.
   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental study on
   transport of nanoparticles dispersed in viscous oil through reservoir
   sand beds. It provides valuable information on propagation and retention
   behaviour of nanoparticles. Considering the rapidly rising use of
   nanoparticles in industry, such transport will be encountered in
   numerous industrial applications and environmental problems.}},

Abstract = {{A low-complexity multirate 3-D spatio-temporal FIR cone and frustum
   filter structure is proposed having potential applications as a
   spatio-temporal directional filter. The cone filter structure employs a
   1-D modified discrete Fourier transform (DFT) filter bank and 2-D
   spatial filters. The frustum filter having a double-frustum-shaped
   passband oriented along the temporal frequency axis is approximated by
   employing an appropriate subset of subbands. Low computational
   complexity is achieved by maximal decimation in the temporal dimension,
   and by employing the DFT-polyphase realization to implement the 1-D
   modified DFT filter bank. The cone and frustum filters are almost alias
   free, and provide near-perfect reconstruction. The reduction in
   computational complexity, relative to undecimated and under-decimated
   realizations, is numerically confirmed by means of a potential
   application involving the attenuation of strong broadband plane wave
   interference.}},

Abstract = {{Navigation involves the integration of methodologies and systems for
   estimating the time-varying attitude of moving objects. A fiber
   strapdown inertial navigation system (FSINS) is presently used in
   several applications related to vehicle navigation. However, the
   absolute attitude and position from FSINS contain an error that
   increases with time. In order to improve the performance of FSINS based
   on our present inertial sensors, the auto-compensation of inertial
   sensor bias in rotation error modulation was proposed. The aim is to
   develop a rotary FSINS, in which the significant sensor bias is
   automatically compensated by rotating the inertial measurement unit
   (IMU), to offer the comparable navigation performance to
   navigation-grade IMU. In the proposed rotational technology, the IMU is
   rotated back and forth in azimuth through four orthogonal positions
   relative to the vehicle's longitudinal axis. Simulation and experimental
   testing are conducted for the prototype, and the results showed that the
   rotary FSINS's navigation performance is improved. (C) 2013 Society of

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The influence of the large-scale vortical structures on the wall shear
   stress in a circular impinging jet is investigated experimentally for a
   Reynolds number of 1260. Time-resolved particle image velocimetry and
   polarographic measurements are performed simultaneously. It is found
   that the instantaneous wall shear stress is strongly dependent on the
   vortex dynamics, particularly for different parts of the transverse
   vortex. The influence of the vortex ring, the secondary and tertiary
   vortices on the ejection/sweep process near the wall is the main
   mechanism involved in the wall shear stress variation. In the region of
   the boundary layer separation, the wall shear stress amplitude increases
   just upstream of the separation and dramatically decreases in the
   recirculation zone downstream from the separation. The interaction
   between primary and secondary structures and their pairing process with
   the tertiary structure affects the sweep/ejection process near the wall
   and subsequently the wall shear stress variation. A comparison between
   the Finite Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) method and the phase average
   technique is performed. It is shown that both methods describe the flow
   dynamics in the impinging region of the vortex ring. However, the FTLE
   method is more suitable for describing the unsteady separation of the
   boundary layer. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   volume based mixing rule is proposed to determine the density of liquid
   mixtures of hydrocarbons. Excess volumes are accounted for with a binary
   interaction parameter, and a correlation is proposed to estimate the
   interaction parameter when mixture data are unavailable. For dissolved
   gaseous solvents and liquid solvents near their critical point, the
   input to the mixing rule is their effective liquid density. Effective
   density correlations were developed for n-alkanes from methane to
   n-heptane and carbon dioxide. The method is only valid for mixtures in
   the liquid region with a reduced temperature below approximately 0.52
   (or higher at higher pressure). The mixing rule with no excess volume
   predicted the density of over 60 binary mixtures of liquid hydrocarbons
   at 25 degrees C and hydrocarbon mixtures with dissolved gas components
   over a broad range of pressures and temperatures with an average
   deviation of less than 1\% when the criterion for validity was met. The
   density of diluted bitumen mixtures was also predicted with the same
   accuracy. All of the data were fitted to within experimental error when
   using binary interaction parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Micromechanical machining, which is the mechanical removal of materials
   using miniature cutting tools, is one of the fabrication methods in the
   microrealm that has recently attracted a great deal of attention because
   it has the advantage of being able to machine complex shapes from
   brittle materials. The most challenging problem in the mechanical
   machining of brittle material is the fabrication of fracture-free
   surfaces. To avoid brittle fractures, a thorough investigation is
   required to find the machining parameters in the ductile cutting regime,
   which is characterized by plastic deformation of the material when the
   chip thickness is smaller than the critical value. In this study,
   cutting forces and surface characteristics of soda lime glass are
   examined in detail. Conical scratch tests are performed to identify the
   critical chip thickness, and the cutting forces in the ductile regime
   are modeled. In addition, coated ball end mill cutters were used to
   perform machining on inclined soda lime glass to investigate the feed
   rate effects, up and down milling, and depth of cuts on the surface
   finish and to examine tool wear.}},

   The force histories of gust-induced loads on a flat-plate model were
   compared to those on an equivalent model accelerated within a uniform
   flow. It was shown that the contribution to force history from fluid
   acceleration could not be neglected, even at a relatively low reduced
   frequency. However, differences between gust loads and
   accelerating-model loads were not proportional to model acceleration.
   Rather, when differences in the fluid velocity fields were examined, the
   force histories were differentiated primarily by the distribution of
   vorticity in the wake, caused by changes in the effective incidence and

Abstract = {{Gasification process has become more attractive around the globe due to
   the energy crisis and environmental issues. An equilibrium model based
   on minimization of Gibbs energy is developed to predict the product gas
   composition of an air-blown coal gasifier. This paper further proposes a
   method for modifying the thermodynamic equilibrium model. The presented
   method includes the introduction of an approach temperature which
   corresponds to the deviation from equilibrium condition. The major
   components in produced gas, H-2, H2O, CH4, CO, CO2, and N-2 have been
   determined and compared with the pure equilibrium modelling as well as
   the experimental data. Comparison with experimental measurements
   revealed that the modification of the equilibrium model has
   significantly reduced the error in predicting the product gas
   composition. In situ CO2 capture using sorbent (CaO) is also
   investigated in order to enhance the hydrogen production and also to
   address the environmental regulations on Green House Gas (GHG)
   emissions. The effect of important process parameters on the product gas
   composition is studied and the temperature of 1200K, pressure of 1 bar,
   air ratio of 0.4, and sorbent to feed ratio of 2.2 have been predicted

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The effect of carbon nanotube (CNT) alignment on the strain sensing
   capabilities of multi-walled carbon nanotube/polycarbonate (MWCNT/PC)
   composites was investigated. Injection and compression molding
   techniques were used to fabricate 5 wt\% MWCNT/PC composites. The
   effects of these molding techniques on the alignment of the MWCNTs were
   observed through micrographs obtained from transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM) and investigated quantitatively using the
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique. A
   one-dimensional piezoresistive model was developed to predict the
   changes in the resistance of the MWCNT/PC composites with respect to the
   applied strain. The strain sensing capabilities of the composites were
   examined along the lengths and widths of the samples through tensile
   testing, and gauge factors were calculated to compare the strain
   sensitivities. A linear correlation was observed between the resistance
   change and the applied strain when subjected to tension, and the
   composite samples fully recovered to their unstressed states upon
   unloading. A sensitivity factor defined by relating the analytical model
   and experimental data provided an indirect measure of the degree of
   MWCNT alignment in the composite. From the results obtained, it was
   evident that the injection molded samples, which exhibited high
   alignment, showed higher gauge factors than the compression molded
   samples. The highest gauge factor was found in the injection molded
   samples perpendicular to the MWCNT alignment.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose We propose a method for the detection of architectural
   distortion in prior mammograms of interval-cancer cases based on the
   expected orientation of breast tissue patterns in mammograms.
   Methods The expected orientation of the breast tissue at each pixel was
   derived by using automatically detected landmarks including the breast
   boundary, the nipple, and the pectoral muscle (in mediolateral-oblique
   views). We hypothesize that the presence of architectural distortion
   changes the normal expected orientation of breast tissue patterns in a
   mammographic image. The angular deviation of the oriented structures in
   a given mammogram as compared to the expected orientation was analyzed
   to detect potential sites of architectural distortion using a measure of
   divergence of oriented patterns. Each potential site of architectural
   distortion was then characterized using measures of spicularity and
   angular dispersion specifically designed to represent spiculating
   patterns. The novel features for the characterization of spiculating
   patterns include an index of divergence of spicules computed from the
   intensity image and Gabor magnitude response using the Gabor angle
   response; radially weighted difference and angle-weighted difference
   (AWD) measures of the intensity, Gabor magnitude, and Gabor angle
   response; and AWD in the entropy of spicules computed from the
   intensity, Gabor magnitude, and Gabor angle response.
   Results Using the newly proposed features with a database of 106 prior
   mammograms of 56 interval-cancer cases and 52 mammograms of 13 normal
   cases, through feature selection and pattern classification with an
   artificial neural network, an area under the receiver operating
   characteristic curve of 0.75 was obtained. Free-response receiver
   operating characteristic analysis indicated a sensitivity of 0.80 at 5.3
   false positives (FPs) per patient. Combining the features proposed in
   the present paper with others described in our previous works led to
   significant improvement with a sensitivity of 0.80 at 3.7 FPs per
   patient.
   Conclusion The proposed methods can detect architectural distortion in
   prior mammograms taken 15 months (on the average) before clinical
   diagnosis of breast cancer, but the FP rate needs to be reduced.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose To determine whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could be
   used to track changes in skeletal morphology during bone healing using
   high-resolution micro-computed tomography (CT) as a standard. We used a
   mouse model of bone injury to compare CT with MRI.
   Materials and Methods Surgery was performed to induce a burr hole
   fracture in the mouse tibia. A selection of biomaterials was immediately
   implanted into the fractures. First we optimized the imaging sequences
   by testing different MRI pulse sequences. Then changes in bone
   morphology over the course of fracture repair were assessed using in
   vivo MRI and CT. Histology was performed to validate the imaging
   outcomes.
   Results The rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE)
   sequence provided sufficient contrast between bone and the surrounding
   tissues to clearly reveal the fracture. It allowed detection of the
   fracture clearly 1 and 14 days postsurgery and revealed soft tissue
   changes that were not clear on CT. In MRI and CT the fracture was seen
   at day 1 and partial healing was detected at day 14.
   Conclusion The RARE sequence was the most suitable for MRI bone imaging.
   It enabled the detection of hard and even soft tissue changes. These
   findings suggest that MRI could be an effective imaging modality for
   assessing changes in bone morphology and pathobiology. J. Magn. Reson.

Abstract = {{A novel and economic waste water treatment technology comprised of
   adsorption coupled with electrochemical regeneration was introduced at
   the University of Manchester in 2006. An electrically conducting
   adsorbent material called Nyex (TM) 1000 (Graphite intercalation based
   material) was developed for the said purpose. This adsorbent material
   delivered significantly lower adsorption capacity for the removal of a
   number of organic pollutants. With the aim to expand the scope of newly
   developed adsorbent material called Nyex (TM) 2000, we studied the
   adsorption of humic acid followed by electrochemical regeneration. Nyex
   (TM) 2000 is a highly electrically conducting material with an
   adsorption capacity almost twice that of Nyex (TM) 1000 (intercalation
   based graphite compound) for humic acid. The adsorption of humic acid
   onto both Nyex (TM) adsorbents was found to be fast enough keeping
   almost the same kinetics with approximately 50\% of the adsorption
   capacity being achieved within the first twenty minutes. The parameters
   affecting the regeneration efficiency, including the treatment time,
   charge passed and current density, were investigated. The regeneration
   efficiency at around 100\% for Nyex (TM) 1000 \& 2000 adsorbents
   saturated with humic acid was obtained using the charge passed of 8 and
   22 Cg(-1) at a current density of 7 mA cm(-2) during a treatment time of
   30 minutes, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, range estimation in a time varying multipath channel is
   investigated, on the basis of which a multicarrier (MC) signal is
   compared with its pseudo-random (PN) counterpart in terms of the
   Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and the maximum likelihood estimator
   (MLE). The CRLB for range estimation in a time varying multipath channel
   is derived for three cases: (1) known channel state information (CSI);
   (2) unknown CSI; and (3) a special case of unknown CSI where the channel
   is modeled via Doppler shift. Furthermore, the MLE is developed for
   range estimation for each one of the above three cases and is
   investigated for a multipath Doppler channel with respect to the
   separability of its multipath components. Besides, the condition for a
   multipath Doppler channel to be separable is explored for a PN signal as
   well as for a MC signal. Simulation results show that range estimation
   with a MC signal outperforms its PN counterpart in a time varying
   channel, similar as that in a time invariant channel.}},

Abstract = {{A new unsupervised classification approach for polarimetric synthetic
   aperture radar (POLSAR) data is proposed in this paper. The
   Wishart-Chernoff distance is calculated and used in an agglomerative
   hierarchical clustering approach. Initial segmentation of POLSAR data
   into clusters is obtained based on the total backscattering power (SPAN)
   combined with the entropy, alpha angle, and anisotropy. The complex
   Wishart clustering is performed to optimize the initialization.
   Optimized clusters with minimum Wishart-Chernoff distance are merged
   hierarchically into an appropriate number of classes. The appropriate
   number of classes is estimated based on the data log-likelihood
   algorithm. Classification results show that the use of Wishart-Chernoff
   distance is superior to that of the Wishart test statistic distance. The
   effectiveness of the proposed Wishart-Chernoff distance is demonstrated
   using Advanced Land Observing Satellite POLSAR data.}},

   learning}},
Journal = {{KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{83-120}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, communication among agents has been established based on
   the group commitment to a common ontology which is unfortunately often
   too strong or unrealistic. In the real world of communicating agents, it
   is preferred to enable agents to exchange information while they keep
   their own individual ontology. While this assumption makes agents
   represent their knowledge more independently and give them more
   flexibility, it also adds to the complexity of communication. We believe
   that agents can overcome this complexity by using their learning
   capability. The agents can learn any concept they do not know but want
   to communicate about with other agents in the multi-agent system where
   they work in. Our goal in this paper is to present a general method for
   agents using ontologies to teach each other concepts to improve their
   communication, and therefore cooperation abilities. In our method, a
   particular agent that understands a concept only ambiguously intends to
   learn it by receiving positive and negative examples for that concept
   from the other agents. Then, utilizing one of the known concept learning
   methods, the agent learns the concept in question. In case of conflicts
   in the received set of examples, the learning agent asks other agents
   again to get involved in the learning process by taking votes. While
   this method allows agents not to share common ontologies, it enables
   agents to establish common grounds on the concepts known only by some of
   them if these common grounds are needed during cooperation. In fact, the
   learned concepts by an agent are compromised among the views of other
   agents the method improves the autonomy of agents using them
   significantly.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Background aims. Synovium-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (S-MSCs)
   have potential utility in clinical joint repair applications. However,
   their scarcity in tissues means S-MSCs cannot be isolated in large
   quantities and need to be expanded in culture. Because synovial tissues
   in vivo are exposed to higher calcium (Ca2+) levels than typically found
   in culture media, this study examined the impact of Ca2+ supplementation
   on the rate of S-MSC proliferation in culture. Methods. S-MSCs were
   serially cultured with or without Ca2+ supplementation. The effect of
   inhibiting Ca2+ uptake was assessed using Ca2+ channel blockers. After
   extended exposure to elevated Ca2+ concentrations, S-MSCs were
   characterized by evaluating surface marker profiles, performing reverse
   transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction and carrying out
   tri-lineage differentiation assays. Results. Elevated Ca2+
   concentrations resulted in enhanced S-MSC proliferation. Peak growth
   occurred at 5.0 mmol/L Ca2+, with an average fold increase of 4.52 +/-
   0.65 per passage over 8 passages compared with 2.03 +/- 0.46 in
   un-supplemented medium. Proliferation was inhibited by Ca2+ channel
   blockers. Ca2+-supplemented cells showed enhanced capacity toward
   osteogenesis (17.82 +/- 4.21 mu g Ca2+ deposited/sample vs. 12.70 +/-
   2.11 mu g Ca2+ deposited/sample) and adipogenesis (0.47 +/- 0.04 mg oil
   red O/sample vs. 0.352 +/- 0.005 mg oil red O/sample) and retained their
   capacity to undergo chondrogenesis (1.37 +/- 0.07 mu g
   glycosaminoglycan/pellet vs. 1.33 +/- 0.17 mu g
   glycosaminoglycan/pellet). S-MSCs cultured in elevated Ca2+ expressed
   enhanced messenger RNA levels for SOX-9 and peroxisome proliferator
   activated receptor gamma and depressed levels for collagen I.
   Conclusions. S-MSC sensitivity to Ca2+ has not been reported previously.
   These findings indicate that S-MSC population expansion rates may be
   up-regulated by Ca2+ supplementation without compromising defining cell
   characteristics. This study exemplifies the need to consider medium
   composition when culturing stem cells.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with diffuse and other ensuing failure modes in
   geomaterials when tested under homogeneous states of shearing in various
   loading programs and drainage conditions. Material instability is indeed
   the basic property that accounts for the instability of an initially
   homogeneous deformation field leading to diffuse failure and strain
   localization in geomaterials. The former is normally characterized by a
   runaway type of failure accompanied with a sudden and violent collapse
   of the material in the absence of any localization phenomena. Against
   this backdrop, we present a brief overview of material instability in
   elastoplastic solids where one finds a rich source of theoretical
   concepts including bifurcation, strain localization, diffuse failure and
   second-order work, as well as a considerable body of experiments. Some
   compelling laboratory experimental studies of material instability with
   focus to diffuse failure are then presented and interpreted based on the
   second-order work. Finally, various material instability analyses using
   an elastoplastic constitutive and a general finite element analysis of
   the above-mentioned laboratory experimental tests are presented as a
   boundary value problem. It is shown that instability can be captured
   from otherwise uniform stress, density and hydraulic states, whereas
   uniform deviatoric loads are being applied on the external boundaries of
   a specimen. Although the numerical simulations reproduce well the
   laboratory experimental results, they also highlight the hierarchy of
   failure modes where localization phenomena emerge in the
   post-bifurcation regime as a result of a degradation of homogeneity

Abstract = {{This work was aimed at providing a local mechanical characterisation of
   tissues from the healthy human atria. Thirty-two tissue specimens were
   harvested from nine adult subjects whose death was not directly related
   to cardiovascular diseases. Tissues were kept in Tyrode's solution and
   tested using a planar biaxial device. Results showed that tissues from
   healthy human atria undergo large deformations under in-plane
   distributed tensions roughly corresponding to an in vivo pressure of 15
   mmHg. The material was modelled as hyperelastic and a Fung-type elastic
   strain energy potential was chosen. This class of potentials is based on
   a function of a quadratic form in the components of the Green-Lagrange
   strain tensor, and it has been previously proved that the fourth-order
   tensor of this quadratic form is proportional to the linear elasticity
   tensor of the linearised theory. This has three important consequences:
   (i) the coefficients in Fung-type potentials have a precise physical
   meaning; (ii) whenever a microstructural description for the linear
   elasticity tensor is available, this is automatically inherited by the
   Fung-type potential; (iii) because of the presence of the linear
   elasticity tensor in the definition of a Fung-type potential, each of
   the three normal stresses is coupled with all three normal strains.We
   propose to include information on the microstructure of the atrium by
   writing the linear elasticity tensor as the volumetric-fraction-weighed
   sum of the linear elasticity tensors of the three constituents of the
   tissue: the ground matrix, the main fibre family and the secondary fibre
   family. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a
   Fung-type potential is given a precise structural meaning, based on the
   directions and the material properties of the fibres. Because of the
   coupling between normal strains and normal stresses, this
   structurally-based Fung-type potential allows for discriminating among
   all testing protocols in planar biaxial stretch.}},

Abstract = {{The propagation and acceleration of a flame surface past obstructions in
   a closed square channel was investigated using large eddy simulation.
   The dynamic Smagorinsky-Lilly subgrid model and the Boger flame surface
   density combustion model were used. The geometry is essentially
   two-dimensional with fence-type obstacles distributed on the top and
   bottom surfaces, equally spaced along the channel length at the channel
   height. Flame propagation, however, is three dimensional as ignition
   occurs at a point at the center of the channel cross-section. The effect
   of obstacle blockage ratio on the development of the flame structure was
   investigated by varying the obstacle height. Three-dimensional cases
   were simulated from the initiation of a combustion kernel through spark
   ignition to the acceleration of the flame front at speeds up to 80 m/s.
   The transition from laminar flame propagation to turbulent flame
   propagation within the ``thin reaction zone{''} regime was observed in
   the simulations. By analyzing the development of the three dimensional
   flame surface and unburned gas flow field, the formation of several
   flame structures observed experimentally are explained. Global
   quantities such as the total flame area and centerline flame velocity
   were ascertained and compared to the experimental data. High amplitude
   oscillations in the centerline flame velocity were found to occur from a
   combination of the unburned gas flow field and fluctuations in the
   volumetric burning rate. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Prediction intervals that provide estimated values as well as the
   corresponding reliability are applied to nonlinear time series forecast.
   However, constructing reliable prediction intervals for noisy time
   series is still a challenge. In this paper, a bootstrapping reservoir
   computing network ensemble (BRCNE) is proposed and a simultaneous
   training method based on Bayesian linear regression is developed. In
   addition, the structural parameters of the BRCNE, that is, the number of
   reservoir computing networks and the reservoir dimension, are determined
   off-line by the 0.632 bootstrap cross-validation. To verify the
   effectiveness of the proposed method, two kinds of time series data,
   including the multisuperimposed oscillator problem with additive noises
   and a practical gas flow in steel industry are employed here. The
   experimental results indicate that the proposed approach has a
   satisfactory performance on prediction intervals for practical
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Shoulder arthroplasty success has been attributed to many factors
   including, bone quality, soft tissue balancing, surgeon experience, and
   implant design. Improved long-term success is primarily limited by
   glenoid implant loosening. Prosthesis design examines materials and
   shape and determines whether the design should withstand a lifetime of
   use. Finite element (FE) analyses have been extensively used to study
   stresses and strains produced in implants and bone. However, these
   static analyses only measure a moment in time and not the adaptive
   response to the altered environment produced by the therapeutic
   intervention. Computational analyses that integrate remodeling rules
   predict how bone will respond over time. Recent work has shown that
   subject-specific two-and three dimensional adaptive bone remodeling
   models are feasible and valid.
   Feasibility and validation were achieved computationally, simulating
   bone remodeling using an intact human scapula, initially resetting the
   scapular bone material properties to be uniform, numerically simulating
   sequential loading, and comparing the bone remodeling simulation results
   to the actual scapula's material properties. Three-dimensional scapula
   FE bone model was created using volumetric computed tomography images.
   Muscle and joint load and boundary conditions were applied based on
   values reported in the literature. Internal bone remodeling was based on
   element strain-energy density. Initially, all bone elements were
   assigned a homogeneous density. All loads were applied for 10
   iterations. After every iteration, each bone element's remodeling
   stimulus was compared to its corresponding reference stimulus and its
   material properties modified. The simulation achieved convergence. At
   the end of the simulation the predicted and actual specimen bone
   apparent density were plotted and compared. Location of high and low
   predicted bone density was comparable to the actual specimen. High
   predicted bone density was greater than actual specimen. Low predicted
   bone density was lower than actual specimen. Differences were probably
   due to applied muscle and joint reaction loads, boundary conditions, and
   values of constants used. Work is underway to study this. Nonetheless,
   the results demonstrate three dimensional bone remodeling simulation
   validity and potential.
   Such adaptive predictions take physiological bone remodeling simulations
   one step closer to reality. Computational analyses are needed that
   integrate biological remodeling rules and predict how bone will respond
   over time. We expect the combination of computational static stress
   analyses together with adaptive bone remodeling simulations to become
   effective tools for regenerative medicine research. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Title = {{Practical process design for in situ gasification of bitumen}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{107}},
Pages = {{281-296}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The province of Alberta, Canada hosts an estimated 170 billion barrels
   of crude bitumen reserves in the Athabasca, Cold Lake and Peace River
   deposits. These reserves are commercially recovered through surface
   mining or in situ recovery methods. Most of the produced bitumen is
   converted in surface upgraders to synthetic crude oil (SCO), a 31-33
   degrees API oil product. Next, SCO is converted to transportation fuels,
   lubricants and petrochemicals in conventional refineries and
   petrochemical industries. In situ recovery or mining as well as bitumen
   upgrading and refining are energy intensive processes that generate huge
   volumes of acid gas, consume massive volumes of water, and are costly.
   Bitumen upgrading requires hydrogen, and currently most of it is
   produced by steam reforming of methane. Alternatively, hydrogen can be
   generated by in situ gasification of bitumen. In situ gasification of
   oil sands is potentially more energy efficient with reduced emission to
   atmosphere since acid gases are sequestered to some extent in the
   reservoir. Also, water usage is lowered and heavy metals and sulfur
   compounds in the bitumen tend to remain downhole since the main product
   is gas. The objective of this research was to understand and optimize
   hydrogen generation by in situ gasification from bitumen reservoirs. The
   central idea was to recover energy from the reservoir in the form of
   hydrogen and bitumen. In situ combustion has been attempted in the
   field, in a pilot run at Marguerite Lake. In this pilot, the produced
   gas contained up to 20 mole percent of hydrogen. In the current study,
   the Marguerite Lake Phase A main-pattern in situ combustion pilot was
   history-matched as a basis to understand a field-operated recovery
   process where in situ gasification reactions occur. Based on Marguerite
   Lake in situ combustion pilot observations, a new in situ bitumen
   gasification process, based on a Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD)
   well configuration, was designed and compared with conventional SAGD on
   the basis of energy investment, emission to atmosphere and water usage.
   The results show that the amount of energy produced per unit of energy
   invested for the in situ gasification process was greater than the steam
   alone recovery process with less than half the water usage. The cyclic
   injection of steam and oxygen as compared to steam injection alone can
   permit design of oil-alone to oil + syngas production processes. (C)

Abstract = {{In thiS work we study a one-machine scheduling problem which is featured

   the total cost which includes the compressing cost and the overtime
   production cost. We propose a heuristic algorithm in which the
   stochastic problem is converted to the deterministic problem by a
   release-time ``converting policy{''}. We coin a concept of a job's
   late-release-impact factor (LRIF) and we propose a LRIF based converting
   policy. We compare the LRIF based converting policy with the ones used

Abstract = {{This study presents Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements of the
   induced flow characteristics generated by single dielectric barrier
   discharge (DBD) actuators in quiescent conditions. The primary aim is to
   establish accurate empirical trends for model development on both the
   maximum induced velocity and body force with voltage and consumed power.
   The results reveal a power law variation for the maximum velocity at low
   voltages which is followed by an asymptotic behavior. In contrast, the
   body force is characterized by two power law regions. The power law
   exponent is shown to be a function of the dielectric thickness,
   frequency and dielectric constant. Reducing the former or increasing the
   latter two result in a higher coefficient and lower voltage at which the
   trend changes. The onset of the second region occurs at a Re similar to
   100 (based on the maximum velocity, u(m), and corresponding half height,
   y(1/2)) and is characterized by a velocity profile which no longer
   agrees with the laminar profile of Glauert whilst moving increasingly
   towards the turbulent case. Phase locked PIV measurements show that as
   the voltage increases the peak momentum transfer shifts from the middle
   of the AC cycle to the latter end of the forward stroke. Lissajous plots
   of u(m)(phi) against the corresponding x location and plasma length
   Delta x demonstrate that the peak momentum transfer remains relatively
   fixed in space as the voltage and plasma length increase. (C) 2013 AIP

Abstract = {{The scenario of ignition of fuels by the passage of shock waves is
   relevant from the perspective of safety, primarily because shock
   ignition potentially plays an important role in deflagration to
   detonation transition. Even in one dimension, simulation of ignition
   between a contact surface or a flame and a shock moving into combustible
   mixture is difficult because of the singular nature of the initial
   conditions. Indeed, initially, as the shock starts moving away from the
   contact surface, the region filled with shocked reactive mixture does
   not exist. In the current work, the formulation is transformed, using
   time and length over time as the independent variables. This
   transformation yields a finite domain from t = 0. In this paper, the
   complete spatial and temporal ignition evolution of hydrogen combustible
   mixtures of different concentrations is studied numerically. Integration
   of the governing equations is performed using an Essentially
   Non-Oscillatory (ENO) algorithm in space and Runge-Kutta in time, while
   the chemistry is modeled by a three-step chain-branching mechanism which
   appropriately mimics hydrogen combustion. Copyright (c) 2013, Hydrogen

Abstract = {{Ultra heavy oil and bitumen contain high molecular weight compounds that
   resulted in more viscous fluids than most conventional crude oils. For
   the production and transportation of such heavy fluids, it is necessary
   to reduce their viscosity. The dilution of bitumen with liquid solvent
   is one of the practical methods to reduce the bitumen viscosity to a
   desired level. In this manuscript, the physical properties (density and
   dynamic viscosity) of a bitumen sample from Athabasca field and its
   diluted mixtures with n-decane have accurately been measured. The
   measurements have been taken under conditions applicable for both in
   situ recovery methods and pipeline transportation. The experiments have
   been conducted in the temperatures varying from ambient temperature up
   to 344 K and at pressures up to 10 MPa and on mixtures with different
   weight fractions of n-decane (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5). The
   generated experimental density and dynamic viscosity data for raw
   bitumen and its mixtures with n-decane were evaluated with predictive
   schemes as well as with correlation models. The influence of pressure,
   temperature, and solvent weight fraction on the density and dynamic
   viscosity of the mixtures was considered in the models and evaluated
   from the experimental results. The results indicated that power law
   model could correlate the dynamic viscosity of Athabasca bitumen and
   n-decarie mixtures well over the studied conditions. The density data
   were also well predicted with an equation that assumes no volume change
   upon mixing occurs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A method combining life cycle assessment (LCA) and real options analyses
   is developed to predict project environmental and financial performance
   over time, under market uncertainties and decision-making flexibility.
   The method is applied to examine alternative uses for oil sands coke, a
   carbonaceous byproduct of processing the unconventional petroleum found
   in northern Alberta, Canada. Under uncertainties in natural gas price
   and the imposition of a carbon price, our method identifies that selling
   the coke to China for electricity generation by integrated gasification
   combined cycle is likely to be financially preferred initially, but
   eventually hydrogen production in Alberta is likely to be preferred.
   Compared to the results of a previous study that used life cycle costing
   to identify the financially preferred alternative, the inclusion of real
   options analysis adds value as it accounts for flexibility in
   decision-making (e.g., to delay investment), increasing the project's
   expected net present value by 25\% and decreasing the expected life
   cycle greenhouse gas emissions by 11\%. Different formulations of the
   carbon pricing policy or changes to the natural gas price forecast alter
   these findings. The combined LCA/real options method provides
   researchers and decision-makers with more comprehensive information than
   can be provided by either technique alone}},

Abstract = {{Detection and tracking surrounding moving obstacles such as vehicles and
   pedestrians are crucial for the safety of mobile robotics and autonomous
   vehicles. This is especially the case in urban driving scenarios. This
   paper presents a novel framework for surrounding moving obstacles
   detection using binocular stereo vision. The contributions of our work
   are threefold. Firstly, a multiview feature matching scheme is presented
   for simultaneous stereo correspondence and motion correspondence
   searching. Secondly, the multiview geometry constraint derived from the
   relative camera positions in pairs of consecutive stereo views is
   exploited for surrounding moving obstacles detection. Thirdly, an
   adaptive particle filter is proposed for tracking of multiple moving
   obstacles in surrounding areas. Experimental results from real-world
   driving sequences demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the
   proposed framework.}},

Abstract = {{Analog and radio frequency (RF) front-end circuit impairments such as
   mismatches between in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) branches can severely
   degrade performance of wireless communications systems. In this paper,
   we propose a technique to compensate for both frequency-independent and
   frequency-dependent impairments in direct conversion transmitters
   (DCTs). The technique employs a recursive algorithm to estimate the
   impairments from instantaneous power of the transmitted RF signal, and
   it jointly mitigates the mismatches/imbalances between the I and Q
   branches and the distortions in each of the I and Q branches. It is
   applicable to wireless communications systems that employ different
   modulation techniques. Theoretical analyses are presented for
   identifiability and convergence properties of the technique. Effects of
   imperfect measurement are discussed. Both computer simulation and
   prototype experimentation are carried out to demonstrate that the
   proposed technique accurately determines and compensates for the DCT
   impairment, and improves the transmitted signal quality.}},

Abstract = {{The regulation of air quality is important for ensuring the health of a
   population. Current air quality decision support systems are very useful
   if the user possesses sufficient data to operate them and the necessary
   expertise to interpret their results. In general, these systems suffer
   as a result of their excessive complexity. The present study describes
   the development of a scalable air quality decision support system using
   the CALPUFF air dispersion model and a Geospatial Information System
   (GIS). This system uses receptor level exposure modeling and outputs
   from CALPUFF to estimate the relative impacts on human populations from
   multiple air pollution sources by calculating intake, defined as the
   amount of pollution that is inhaled by a population and intake fraction,
   defined as the fraction of pollutant emitted by a pollution source that
   is inhaled by a population. Unlike ground level pollution concentration,
   intake and intake fraction consider receptors and offer a more valuable
   estimate of pollution exposure, especially when faced with limited input
   data. The system also leverages the inherent strength of GIS to improve
   accessibility of geospatial data by generating maps of ground level
   pollutant concentration, intake, and intake fraction using graduated
   color schemes. This enables any user to identify potentially hazardous
   pollution sources and prioritize decisions such as development,

Abstract = {{In recent years, much effort has been invested to develop room
   temperature inexpensive, but sensitive, millimeter wave (MMW) and
   terahertz (THz) detectors that can be used as pixels in focal plane
   arrays, which is important for real-time imaging. A new 18 x 2 neon
   indicator lamp MMW/THz scanner was developed. The components of the
   camera include horizontally shifted two-column glow discharge detectors
   in a scanning array. The detectors, costing about 50 cents each, are
   wired to a preprocessing card, a VLSI board, and a motor for scanner
   movement. A description of the VLSI Verilog programmable hardware of the
   new scanner, the physical architecture, the software user interface, and
   imaging results at 97 GHz are presented. At this stage, the emphasis is
   focused on the lamp exposure time and spatial resolution when the
   scanning is performed horizontally. In the future it is planned to
   expose all pixels simultaneously for real-time imaging. New software
   capabilities allow the application of digital image enhancement
   algorithms. Fast scanning permits obtaining images in 1 to 5 s.
   Oversampling yields a sharper edge response and a higher signal-to-noise

Abstract = {{The deposition of asphaltenes is one of the most difficult problems to
   overcome in oil production and processing. The presence of asphaltenes
   in crude oil, and consequently, the adsorption and deposition of
   asphaltenes on the rock surfaces, affects the rock properties, such as
   porosity, permeability, and wettability. This study aims at analyzing
   the effect of the chemical nature of 12 types of nanoparticles on
   asphaltenes adsorption; hence, the delay or inhibition of deposition and
   precipitation of asphaltenes on porous media under flow conditions at
   reservoir pressure and temperature were investigated. The adsorption
   equilibrium of asphaltenes onto nanoparticles was effectively achieved
   within relatively short times (approximately 2 min), which indicates the
   promising nature of adsorbents for delaying the agglomeration and
   inhibiting the precipitation and deposition of asphaltenes. The
   adsorption equilibrium of asphaltenes for the nanoparticles was
   determined using a batch method in the range 150-2000 mg/L. The
   equilibrium adsorption data were fit to both the Langmuir and Freundlich
   models. Additionally, in this study, the transport of nanoparticles in a
   porous media at a typical reservoir pressure and temperature was
   investigated. As a result, the use of nanoparticles allowed the system
   to flow successfully, which demonstrated the inhibition of precipitation
   and deposition and the enhanced perdurability against asphaltene damage
   in the porous media.}},

Abstract = {{The deposition of asphaltenes is one of the most difficult problems to

   asphaltenes in crude oil and, consequently, the adsorption and
   deposition of asphaltenes on rock surfaces, affects rock properties such

   of adsorption isotherms at different temperatures (usually corresponding
   to reservoir temperatures), thereby improving our understanding of
   adsorption equilibrium behavior at reservoir conditions, which should
   lead to reductions in experimental/analytical time and operation costs.
   The theoretical predictions of isotherms were validated successfully by
   determining the root-mean-square errors (RSM\%) between data obtained
   from published literature and values predicted for asphaltenes and
   surfaces with differing chemical natures. The RSM\% value is below 5\%
   for all predictions. Additionally, the Dubinin-Astakhov model is used to
   correlate adsorption characteristic curves, resulting in RSM\% values
   lower than 10\%.}},

Abstract = {{Terrestrial laser scanners are sophisticated instruments that operate
   much like high-speed total stations. It has previously been shown that
   unmodelled systematic errors can exist in modern terrestrial laser
   scanners that deteriorate their geometric measurement precision and
   accuracy. Typically, signalised targets are used in point-based
   self-calibrations to identify and model the systematic errors. Although
   this method has proven its effectiveness, a large quantity of signalised
   targets is required and is therefore labour-intensive and limits its
   practicality. In recent years, feature-based self-calibration of aerial,
   mobile terrestrial, and static terrestrial laser scanning systems has
   been demonstrated. In this paper, the commonalities and differences
   between point-based and plane-based self-calibration ( in terms of model
   identification and parameter correlation) are explored. The results of
   this research indicate that much of the knowledge from point-based
   self-calibration can be directly transferred to plane-based calibration
   and that the two calibration approaches are nearly equivalent. New
   network configurations, such as the inclusion of tilted scans, were also
   studied and prove to be an effective means for strengthening the
   self-calibration solution, and improved recoverability of the horizontal
   collimation axis error for hybrid scanners, which has always posed a
   challenge in the past.}},

Abstract = {{Importance: Lubricin may be an important barrier to the development of
   corneal and conjunctival epitheliopathies that may occur in dry eye
   disease and contact lens wear.
   Objective: To test the hypotheses that lubricin (ie, proteoglycan 4
   {[}PRG4]), a boundary lubricant, is produced by ocular surface epithelia
   and acts to protect the cornea and conjunctiva against significant shear
   forces generated during an eyelid blink and that lubricin deficiency
   increases shear stress on the ocular surface and promotes corneal
   damage.
   Design, Setting, and Participants: Human, porcine, and mouse tissues and
   cells were processed for molecular biological, immunohistochemical, and
   tribological studies, and wild-type and PRG4 knockout mice were
   evaluated for corneal damage.
   Results: Our findings demonstrate that lubricin is transcribed and
   translated by corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells. Lubricin
   messenger RNA is also present in lacrimal and meibomian glands, as well
   as in a number of other tissues. Absence of lubricin in PRG4 knockout
   mice is associated with a significant increase in corneal fluorescein
   staining. Our studies also show that lubricin functions as an effective
   friction-lowering boundary lubricant at the human cornea-eyelid
   interface. This effect is specific and cannot be duplicated by the use
   of hyaluronate or bovine serum albumin solutions.
   Conclusions and Relevance: Our results show that lubricin is
   transcribed, translated, and expressed by ocular surface epithelia.
   Moreover, our findings demonstrate that lubricin presence significantly
   reduces friction between the cornea and conjunctiva and that lubricin
   deficiency may play a role in promoting corneal damage.}},

Abstract = {{We present a numerical simulation approach that allows incorporation of
   emulsion modeling into steam-assisted gravity-drainage (SAGD)
   simulations with commercial reservoir simulators by means of a two-stage
   pseudochemical reaction. Numerical simulation results show excellent
   agreement with experimental data for low-pressure SAGD, accounting for
   approximately 24\% deficiency in simulated oil recovery, compared with
   experimental data. Incorporating viscosity alteration, multiphase
   effect, and enthalpy of emulsification appears sufficient for effective
   representation of in-situ emulsion physics during SAGD in
   very-high-permeability systems. We observed that multiphase effects
   appear to dominate the viscosity effect of emulsion flow under SAGD
   conditions of heavy-oil (bitumen) recovery. Results also show that
   in-situ emulsification may play a vital role within the reservoir during
   SAGD, increasing bitumen mobility and thereby decreasing cumulative
   steam/oil ratio (cSOR). Results from this work extend understanding of
   SAGD by examining its performance in the presence of in-situ
   emulsification and associated flow of emulsion with bitumen in porous
   media.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel algebraic integer (AI) based multi-encoding
   of Daubechies-4 and -6 2-D wavelet filters having error-free
   integer-based computation. Digital VLSI architectures employing parallel
   channels are proposed, physically realized and tested. The multi-encoded
   AI framework allows a multiplication-free and computationally accurate
   architecture. It also guarantees a noise-free computation throughput the
   multi-level multi-rate 2-D filtering operation. A single final
   reconstruction step (FRS) furnishes filtered and down-sampled image
   outputs in fixed-point, resulting in low levels of quantization noise.
   Comparisons are provided between Daubechies-4 and -6 designs in terms of
   SNR, PSNR, hardware structure, and power consumptions, for different
   word lengths. SNR and PSNR improvements of approximately 30\% were
   observed in favour of AI-based systems, when compared to 8-bit
   fixed-point schemes (six fractional bits). Further, FRS designs based on
   canonical signed digit representation and on expansion factors are
   proposed. The Daubechies-4 and -6 4-level VLSI architectures are
   prototyped on a Xilinx Virtex-6 vcx240t-1ff1156 FPGA device at 282 MHz
   and 146 MHz, respectively, with dynamic power consumption of 164 mW and
   339 mW, respectively, and verified on FPGA chip using an ML605 platform.}},

Abstract = {{Nano-textured super hydrophobic (SH) surfaces can achieve very high
   droplet contact angles (typically >150 degrees) and are furthermore
   associated with reduced surface adsorption of enzymes and other
   macromolecules. The advantages of such SH surfaces have already been
   explored for electrostatic based digital microfluidic (DMF) devices
   where the high CA and the reduced surface adsorption largely benefits
   the handling and manipulation of complex bio-chemical samples/reagents.
   Liquid dielectrophoresis (LDEP) based digital microfluidic (DMF)
   technology has demonstrated its capability for achieving combinatorial
   assays on standard hydrophobic surfaces. However, such devices suffer
   from similar issues as DMF devices when it comes to handling
   bio-reagents/samples where off-chip sample handling steps
   (washing/buffer exchange) are often required prior to the on-chip
   bio-assay. In this work, we have optimized a comprehensive fabrication
   protocol to develop a nano-textured SH surface topology for LDEP device
   applications. The static and transient behavior of LDEP actuation over
   the SH surface has been investigated using an improved lumped model and
   furthermore experimentally verified using specifically tailored liquid
   samples. The developed SH surface has also been analyzed for liquid
   actuation of TAQ DNA polymerase enzyme which is a key component of most
   nucleic acid amplification assays. The performance of LDEP actuation of
   tailored liquid samples is analyzed and compared for both hydrophobic
   and SH surfaces. The reported work demonstrates that specific textured
   SH surfaces can successfully achieve reliable LDEP actuation and
   furthermore dispense/manipulate TAQ DNA polymerase enzyme and various
   other aqueous samples. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Collagen degradation is one of the early signs of osteoarthritis. It is
   not known how collagen degradation affects chondrocyte volume and
   morphology. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of
   enzymatically induced collagen degradation on cell volume and shape
   changes in articular cartilage after a hypotonic challenge. Confocal
   laser scanning microscopy was used for imaging superficial zone
   chondrocytes in intact and degraded cartilage exposed to a hypotonic
   challenge. Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy, polarized light
   microscopy, and mechanical testing were used to quantify differences in
   proteoglycan and collagen content, collagen orientation, and
   biomechanical properties, respectively, between the intact and degraded
   cartilage. Collagen content decreased and collagen orientation angle
   increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the superficial zone cartilage
   after collagenase treatment, and the instantaneous modulus of the
   samples was reduced significantly (p < 0.05). Normalized cell volume and
   height 20 min after the osmotic challenge (with respect to the original
   volume and height) were significantly (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01,
   respectively) larger in the intact compared to the degraded cartilage.
   These findings suggest that the mechanical environment of chondrocytes,
   specifically collagen content and orientation, affects cell volume and
   shape changes in the superficial zone articular cartilage when exposed
   to osmotic loading. This emphasizes the role of collagen in modulating
   cartilage mechanobiology in diseased tissue.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{80}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Quad-pol data are generally acknowledged as providing the highest
   performance in ship detection applications using SAR data. Yet quad-pol
   data have half the swath width of single and dual-pol data and are thus
   less useful for maritime surveillance, where wide area coverage is
   crucial. Compact polarimetry (CP) has been proposed as a compromise
   between swath width and polarization information. The
   circular-transmit-linear-receive (CTLR) CP data have certain engineering
   advantages over other CP configurations. CF data may be used to
   reconstruct a reduced quad-pol covariance matrix (termed pseudo-quad, or
   PQ data) and the potential of these data in terrestrial applications has
   recently been demonstrated. We present some of the first results on the
   use of CTLR data and reconstructed quad-pol data for ship detection. We
   use Radarsat-2 fine-quad (FQ) data to examine 76 ships over a range of
   incidence angles and ship orientations at low to moderate wind speeds.
   We examined the ship detection performance of full quad-pol and full-PQ
   data; several dual-pol configurations suggested in the literature, HV
   and PQ HV and the raw CTLR data. We find that the ship detection
   performance of the PQHV data is the strongest of all the detectors we
   examined, with performance that was comparable to quad-pol data. Other
   strong performers were HV and CTLR data. (C) 2013 International Society

Abstract = {{Earthquakes are one of the most destructive and harmful natural
   disasters, especially in recent years, the 2008/5/12 Wenchuan M7.9
   earthquake, the 2011/3/11 Tohoku M9.0 earthquake and the 2012/4/11
   Sumatra M8.6 earthquake have caused a significant impact to the human
   life. In this paper, we make a study of the temporal and spatial
   distribution of the Global Positioning System Total Electron Content
   (GPS TEC) anomalies prior to the three strong earthquakes by the method
   of statistical analysis. Our results show that the pre-earthquake
   ionospheric anomalies are mainly positive anomalies and take the shape
   of a double-crest structure with a trough near the epicenter. The
   ionospheric anomalies do not coincide with the vertical projection of
   the epicenter of the subsequent earthquake, but mainly localize in the
   near-epicenter region and corresponding ionospheric anomalies are also
   simultaneously observed in the magnetic conjugate region prior to the
   three earthquakes. In addition, the amplitude and scale-size of the
   ionospheric Delta TEC are different with the magnitude of the
   earthquake, and the horizontal scale-size of the greatest anomalies
   before the Tohoku M9.0 earthquake is similar to 30 degrees in longitude
   and similar to 10 degrees in latitude, with the maximum amplitude of TEC
   disturbances reaching similar to 20 TECu relative to the background. The
   peak of anomaly enhancement usually occurs in the afternoon to sunset
   (i.e. between 14:00 and 18:00 local time) which lasts for approximate 2
   hours. Possible causes of these anomalies are discussed, and after
   eliminating the effect of solar activities and magnetic storms it can be
   concluded that the detected obvious and regular anomalous behavior in
   TEC within just a few days before the earthquakes is related with the
   forthcoming earthquakes with high probability.}},

Abstract = {{Our aim was to develop a remote sensing-based forest fire danger
   forecasting system (FFDFS) and its implementation in forecasting 2011
   fire season in the Canadian province of Alberta. The FFDFS used Moderate
   Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived 8-day composites of
   surface temperature, normalized multiband drought index, and normalized
   difference vegetation index as input variables. In order to eliminate
   the data gaps in the input variables, we propose a gap-filling technique
   by considering both of the spatial and temporal dimensions. These input
   variables were calculated during the i period and then integrated to
   forecast the fire danger conditions into four categories (i.e., very
   high, high, moderate, and low) during the i + 1 period. It was observed
   that 98.19 \% of the fire fell under ``very high{''} to ``moderate{''}
   danger classes. The performance of this system was also demonstrated its
   ability to forecast the worst fires occurred in Slave Lake and Fort
   McMurray region during mid-May 2011. For example, 100 and 94.0 \% of the
   fire spots fell under ``very high{''} to ``high{''} danger categories
   for Slave Lake and Fort McMurray regions, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{A uniformly most powerful watermark detector, which applies the Bessel K
   form (BKF) probability density function to model the noise distribution
   was proposed by Bian and Liang. In this paper, we derive a locally
   optimum (LO) detector using the same noise model. Since the literature
   lacks thorough discussion on the performance of the BKF-LO
   nonlinearities, the performance of the proposed detector is discussed in
   detail. First, we prove that the test statistic of the proposed detector
   is asymptotically Gaussian and evaluate the actual performance of the
   proposed detector using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC).
   Then, the large sample performance of the proposed detector is evaluated
   using asymptotic relative efficiency (ARE) and ``maximum ARE.{''} The
   experimental results show that the proposed detector has a good
   performance with or without attacks in terms of its ROC curves,
   particularly when the watermark is weak. Therefore, the proposed method
   is suitable for wavelet domain watermark detection, particularly when
   the watermark is weak.}},

Abstract = {{An important issue in construction, repair, maintenance, and testing is
   the ability to select an optimal window of opportunity within a
   short-term period of time. This optimal window is typically governed by
   external variables, such as weather, or affected by operational
   conditions. Therefore, a decision-maker faces sequential decisions to
   start' or to wait for better' conditions. We examine how this problem is
   best formulated, which optimisation criteria make sense from an
   engineering point of view, which kind of stopping' rules can be used,
   and which stochastic solutions or solution methods are known and/or
   available. We also discuss how discounting affects the decision-making
   and its outcome, as in many practical situations waiting' comes with an
   expensive price tag. The effect on the outcome of the selection process
   of assuming a simple dependence structure between the opportunities is
   also assessed. To illustrate the various formulations of this problem,
   we contrast different criteria and decision rules, assuming different
   scenarios.}},

Pages = {{261-268}},

Abstract = {{The dominant mechanism of enhanced heavy oil recovery by chemical
   flooding is studied by conducting various chemical slug injections in a
   two-dimensional physical model. In this study, a total of seven
   single-chemical-slug tests and another seven two-chemical-slug tests are
   conducted to test the contribution of alkaline, surfactant, polymer, and
   their combinations to enhanced heavy oil recovery. The relationship
   between the tertiary oil recovery and the pressure drop of the seven
   single-slug floods is analyzed, and it is discovered that the two have a
   good correlation. Comparison of the tertiary oil recoveries of different
   chemical slug tests shows that the improved waterflood for the heavy oil
   used in this study is mainly due to the reduction of water mobility. The
   results of two-chemical-slug tests show that after regular
   alkaline/surfactant/polymer flooding, the second polymer slug injection
   can recover more oil, if a water slug injection is applied between the
   two chemical slugs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of disability worldwide. We
   hypothesized that inflammation following isolated intra-articular bone
   injury can stimulate post-traumatic OA and developed a rabbit model to
   test that concept. Sixty female New Zealand White Rabbits were used.
   Twenty-six experimental animals had two holes drilled into their right
   femoral-notch, 18 rabbits had sham surgery, and 16 were un-operated
   controls. Rabbits were euthanized in subgroups at 72h, 3, 6, 9, and 52
   weeks. Knees were assessed grossly and tissues collected. Cartilage and
   synovium were analyzed with histology and qPCR and subgroups compared
   statistically. All surgical joints showed gross and histological
   (modified Mankin score) cartilage damage after surgery, with
   experimentals worsening with time (p<0.05). Cartilage qPCR showed
   fivefold increases in TGF (p<0.05) expression at 72h and 3 weeks with
   sixfold increases in MMP13 (p<0.025) expression at 72h. By 6 weeks,
   expression of these markers was similar to baseline levels. Synovial
   membrane thickening with increased cellularity was seen at both 9 and 52
   weeks (p<0.05). Short-term synovial inflammatory marker (IL-1, IL-Ra,
   IL-6, and IL-8) expression was three- to fourfold increase in
   experimentals at 72h (p<0.01) returning to baseline levels by 3 weeks.
   Intra-articular bone injury creates early joint inflammation with some
   chronic synovial changes and progressive cartilage damage consistent
   with OA in adult rabbits. This model provides an exciting new avenue to
   potentially explore some relevant inflammatory drivers of OA without
   major mechanical variables. (c) 2013 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Abstract = {{Insight on the role of a new heterogeneous catalyst for catalytic steam
   gasification of adsorbed asphaltenes is reported. The catalyst was
   prepared by incorporating NiO nanoparticles into mesoporous-macroporous
   Ba-based meta kaolin intended both as catalyst support as well as
   adsorbent. Variations on the catalyst support were made in form of
   extrudates by adding a binder (Ba(CH3COO)(2) and/or Ca(CH3COO)(2)) and
   sucrose as a porogenic substance, to kaolin and calcining in air
   typically at 650 degrees C. Effect of the binder type and content,
   sucrose content and calcination temperature upon adsorption was
   determined by performing adsorption study of Quinoline-65 (Q-65) using
   UV-Vis spectrophotometry. The surface basicity of catalyst support was
   measured by CO2 temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments.
   Pore size distribution was determined by Nitrogen physisorption. The
   Q-65 uptake was correlated to the pore size distribution and the
   basicity of the adsorbents. The results suggest that solids having low
   surface basicity and with increased pore size distribution between 200
   and 800 angstrom showed better adsorption. Further, incorporation of NiO
   nanoparticles into these catalyst supports not only enhanced the
   adsorption of asphaltenes, but also promoted the steam gasification of
   the adsorbed asphaltenes, leading to CO2 and H-2 as major products. (C)

Abstract = {{Transmitter digital domain linearisation solutions are constantly
   evolving to extract optimum benefits in terms of cost, performance and
   flexibility. This study highlights the current and futuristic trends in
   the arena of transmitter system modelling and digital domain
   compensation for radio frequency distortions of non-linear power
   amplifiers and wireless transmitters in case of single-band wireless
   transmitter, which is further extended to a dual-band transmitter.
   Indeed, the dual-band transmitter results in severe non-linear
   distortion as compared to the single-band transmitter when operated in
   concurrent mode, due to the additional inter-modulation products
   generated by the dual-band transmitted signals. Hence, in addition to
   the intermodulation products and memory effects exhibited in a
   single-band transmitter, the cross-modulation effects of the dual-band
   signals should be compensated for as well in a dual-band transmitter.
   The effects of the modulator imperfections such as gain and phase
   imbalances, phase errors and DC offsets and their impact on the feedback
   loop of a digital predistortion system are also analysed. A thorough
   comparison between the state-of-the-art behavioural models and their
   application to digital predistortion technique of power amplifier is
   presented in terms of performance and complexity. Model performance
   assessment is discussed through simulation and experimental results for
   both single- and dual-band systems.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene/nickel composites were prepared by electrodeposition in a
   nickel sulfamate solution with graphene oxide (GO) sheets in suspension.
   Raman spectra demonstrated that the GO sheets had been reduced during
   the electrodeposition process and the graphene content was 0.12 wt\%.
   X-ray diffraction patterns showed the preferred orientation of nickel
   growth changing from (2 0 0) to (1 1 1) in the composites. Transmission
   and scanning electron microscopy images were used to help explain how
   the introduction of graphene substrates leads to the change of preferred
   orientation. Measurements showed the thermal conductivity of the
   composites to be about 15\% more than that of pure nickel
   electrodeposits. Significant improvement was also demonstrated in the
   hardness measured by nanoindentation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Self-assembled Nafion films of varying thickness were generated on SiO2
   terminated silicon wafer by immersion in Nafion dispersions of different
   concentrations. The impact of solvent/dispersion media was probed by
   preparing films from two different types of Nafion
   dispersions-IPA-diluted dispersion and Nafion-in-water dispersion. The
   thickness of films was ascertained by three different techniques:
   variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE), atomic force
   microscopy (AFM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The three
   techniques yielded consistent nominal thicknesses of 4, 10, 30, 55, 75,
   110, 160, and 300 nm for films self-assembled from IPA-diluted Nafion
   dispersions of concentrations 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, and
   5.0 wt \%, respectively. Films generated from 0.25-5.0 wt \%
   Nafion-in-water dispersions generated comparable thicknesses. An
   interesting finding of our work is the observation of bimodal surface
   wettability, investigated by water contact angle. The sub-55 nm films
   were found to exhibit hydrophilic surface whereas the thicker films
   showed hydrophobic surface similar to those reported for Nafion
   membranes Employing XDLVO theory, surface energies of the hydrophobic,
   160 nm film was found to be similar to that reported for Nafion membrane
   whereas those for the hydrophilic 4 nm film yielded high
   electron-accepting/proton-donating parameters resulting in an enhanced
   surface polarity. It can be concluded that the structure and properties
   of the ultrathin (<55 nm) Nafion films are distinct from those of the
   thicker (but still submicrometer) films, which are likely similar to
   those of the well Nafion membranes. No significant effect of dispersion
   type was observed for 10-300 nm thick films.}},

Title = {{SAGD well orientation in point bar oil sand deposit affects performance}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{157}},
Pages = {{79-92}},
Month = {{MAY 8}},
Abstract = {{The creation and evolution of point bar reservoir systems are well
   understood in meandering river deposits. A large fraction of Athabasca
   oil sand deposits are ancient point bar systems characterized by bedded,
   sandstone-dominated strata with interbedded siltstone layers. The
   recovery process of choice for these deposits is the Steam-Assisted
   Gravity Drainage (SAGD) process due to the high viscosity of the oil,
   low solution-gas ratio, and often caps rock not sufficient to withstand
   injection pressures of Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS). However, because
   of the presence of siltstone interbeds, these reservoirs commonly have
   lateral and vertical lithological heterogeneity which interfere with the
   formation of uniform steam chambers along SAGD wellpairs. Other units in
   point bar deposits that impact SAGD chamber development within the
   formation include remnant channel succession and channel lag. The
   objective of this research is to construct a detailed three-dimensional
   point bar model to determine how its heterogeneity impacts SAGD
   performance. Here, the point bar model is based on the Lower Cretaceous
   Middle McMurray Formation in the Athabasca oil sand deposit in Alberta,
   Canada. Single SAGD wellpair submodels at different locations and
   orientations were extracted from the detailed point bar model. The
   results of the reservoir model simulation suggest that attention must be
   paid to SAGD wellpair placement in point bar systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In a competitive electricity market, a generation company (GenCo)
   optimizes its operation schedules, referred to as self-scheduling, in
   order to maximize its profit. However, various sources of uncertainty,
   such as market price fluctuations or forced outage of generating units,
   may impact the GenCo's profit. In this paper, a non-probabilistic
   information-gap model is proposed to model the uncertainties in
   short-term scheduling of a GenCo. The self-scheduling problem is
   formulated for risk-neutral, risk-averse, and risk-seeker GenCos.
   Robustness of the decisions against low market prices are evaluated
   using a robustness model. Furthermore, windfall higher profit due to
   unpredicted higher market prices is modeled using an opportunity
   function. The proposed models are applied to a 54-unit thermal GenCo.}},

Abstract = {{Scientific and engineering research is heavily dependent on effective
   development and use of software artifacts. Many of these artifacts are
   produced by the scientists themselves, rather than by trained software
   engineers. To address the challenges in this area, a research community
   often referred to as ``Development of Scientific Software{''} has
   emerged in the last few decades. As this research area has matured,
   there has been a sharp increase in the number of papers and results made
   available, and it has thus become important to summarize and provide an
   overview about those studies. Through a systematic mapping and
   bibliometrics study, we have reviewed 130 papers in this area. We
   present the results of our study in this paper. Also we have made the
   mapping data available on an online repository which is planned to be
   updated on a regular basis. The results of our study seem to suggest
   that many software engineering techniques and activities are being used
   in the development of scientific software. However, there is still a
   need for further exploration of the usefulness of specific software
   engineering techniques (e.g., regarding software maintenance, evolution,
   refactoring, re(v)-engineering, process and project management) in the
   scientific context. It is hoped that this article will help (new)
   researchers get an overview of the research space and help them to
   understand the trends in the area.}},

Abstract = {{Placement is a stage in the design of digital circuits where the
   locations of the circuit components are determined, while minimizing the
   total length of wires connecting them. A priori individual length
   estimates can be used to improve the quality of a placement solution.
   However, finding such estimates is a daunting task. A technique based on
   Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) is developed in this paper. Unlike
   polynomials, the RBFs provide flexible basis elements with only local
   support, which greatly enhances both their robustness and their ability
   to fit highly non-linear data sets. Today's placement problems deal with
   a very large number of components making it impossible to apply
   traditional RBF modeling techniques. Thus specialized methods for
   determining the RBF centers and shape parameters are developed. The
   proposed technique is tested on popular benchmark circuits, and shows
   improvements of up to 24\% over the best existing model for mixed-size
   circuits. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{As conventional gas resources in Canada decline, more interest is being
   given to unconventional shale gas reservoirs. Natural gas also has the
   potential to overcome other petroleum sources, such as coal, heavy oil,
   and conventional oil, as the fuel of choice because it is a cleaner
   source of energy with lower carbon emissions. As the world slowly shifts
   toward cleaner energy sources, it becomes increasingly important to
   study unconventional shale gas reservoirs. Shallow biogenic shale gas
   reservoirs generate gas by microbial activity, implying that current
   production to the surface consists of ancient adsorbed gas as well as
   recent biogenerated gas. Approximately 20\% of all of the methane
   generated is generally thought to be of microbial origin. Most shallow
   shale gas reservoirs are at temperatures of less than 80 degrees C, and
   given the supply of carbon, water, and minerals, they can be thought of
   as multi-kilometer-scale bioreactors. In this study, the reaction rate
   kinetics for methane production were determined from experimental data
   using produced water and core samples from a shallow shale gas
   reservoir. These data, together with Langmuir desorption data, were used
   to model a heterogeneous shale gas reservoir using reactive reservoir
   simulation. The results show that biogenic shale gas generation accounts
   for about 12\% of the total gas produced during a period of 2678 days.
   This is a significant percentage of the total gas production, and
   therefore, there is great potential to enhance methanogenesis within
   these reservoirs, because there are a number of methods to enhance
   microbial activity.}},

Abstract = {{Asphaltenes self-associate, and the molecular weight and density
   distributions are a factor in asphaltene precipitiation. To determine
   these distributions, heptane-extracted asphaltenes from four crude oils
   were fractionated into solubility cuts. The asphaltenes were dissolved
   in toluene and then partially precipitated at specified ratios of
   heptane/toluene to generate sets of light (soluble) and heavy
   (insoluble) cuts. The molecular weight and density were measured for
   each cut. The asphaltenes were found to include both associating and
   non-associating asphaltenes. The content of non-associating components
   was up to 15 wt \% of the asphaltenes. The density distributions were
   determined directly from the data. The molecular weight data were fitted
   with a self-association model to predict the distributions at any given
   concentration. Then, a guideline was developed to represent the
   molecular weight distribution of non-associated and associated
   asphaltenes with a Gamma distribution function. Finally, the density of
   asphaltene cuts was correlated to their molecular weight. This
   correlation fit the data with an average absolute deviation of 11
   kg/m(3).}},

Title = {{Experimental Evaluation of SAGD/ISC Hybrid Recovery Method}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CANADIAN PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{52}},

Abstract = {{Most current in-situ recovery methods have limitations which restrict
   their application in many heavy-oil reservoirs. There is also a variety
   of undesirable environmental issues associated with existing
   thermal-recovery techniques. To overcome some of these problems, novel
   hybrid processes have been proposed that combine steam-assisted gravity
   drainage (SAGD) and in-situ-combustion (ISC) technologies. In the
   conventional ISC process, oil is displaced by an elevated-temperature
   combustion zone, but when the native oil mobility is low, this
   displacement becomes problematic because of the low oil mobility
   downstream of the combustion front. Heating the reservoir and reducing
   the distance between injector and producer can prevent such cold liquid
   blocking in the combustion process. This suggests that a well
   configuration that greatly decreases the distance between the injector
   and the producer (e.g., the SAGD well configuration) could be
   advantageous in ISC-based recovery methods. Moreover, running the SAGD
   operation in the initial period creates a vapour-filled depleted zone in
   the reservoir that would be sufficiently hot to start combustion on air
   injection.
   To investigate the feasibility of this idea, a hybrid experiment was
   conducted at a representative reservoir pressure. During the experiment,
   SAGD was operated in a physical model for a period and then combustion
   was started by switching from steam injection to air injection. A
   modified well arrangement was used to help the process operation, oil
   ignition, and combustion-front formation. Residual oil and water
   saturations in the model were analyzed. Also, core samples were
   extracted from the model to evaluate asphaltenes and coke formation. It
   was shown that it may be possible to recover nearly 70\% of the original
   oil in place with a modified well arrangement.}},

   phase behavior measurements were undertaken with an in-house designed
   PVT apparatus. The solubility of carbon dioxide in liquid hydrocarbons
   and its effect on the physical properties were examined. Increase in the
   pressure caused an increase in the carbon dioxide solubility and
   consequently, a decline in the viscosity of saturated liquid phase and
   an increase in the density of gas-expanded liquid were observed. The
   carbon dioxide solubility was lower in the heavier liquid mixture. The
   experimental data were well modeled with Soave-Redlich-Kwong and

Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the tradeoff relationship between the spectral efficiency
   (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) of homogenous cellular networks in which
   the BSs are arbitrarily distributed is investigated. The network
   performance metrics of SE and EE are assessed subject to a downlink
   transmission outage constraint in interference-limited operational
   environments. The EE is expressed in closed form as a function of SE,
   based on which the performance bounds of the network are derived. Unlike
   the traditional inverse relationship between SE and EE, it is found in
   this paper that there exists an operational regime for which both the SE
   and EE increase while satisfying the outage requirement, and the density
   of base stations (BSs) simultaneously sharing the spectrum is optimal.
   The difference in the performance achieved for the SE when operating in
   the EE maximizing mode as compared with the SE maximizing mode strongly
   depends on the received signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) threshold. In
   the SE-EE tradeoff regime, the analytical tools from microeconomics
   theory are applied to determine the optimal BS density with respect to
   the utility achieved by the network operator via balancing the SE and EE
   objectives. Numerical results show that, by tuning a preference factor
   toward either the SE or EE metrics, it is feasible to realize Pareto
   optimal performance.}},

Abstract = {{Gas hydrates represent a potential future energy source as well as a
   considerable geohazard. In order to assess both the benefits and risks
   that gas hydrate bearing sediments pose, fundamental information about
   their physical properties is required. In this study, the undrained
   shear strength of methane hydrate bearing sand was investigated. The
   experimental program required modifications to an existing triaxial
   apparatus and accurate determination of the hydrate saturation lead to
   the use of two methods for comparison of the saturation calculations.
   Strength results indicated that the presence of gas hydrate will
   increase the sediment's undrained shear strength and corresponding
   stiffness. The relative contribution of cohesion and friction angle was
   observed to be a function of the hydrate saturation, for this particular
   hydrate formation methodology. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Using externally bonded (EB) fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) laminates
   for strengthening steel-concrete composite girders has recently received
   more attention from researchers. By prestressing the EB FRP laminates,
   the material is used more efficiently because a greater portion of its
   tensile capacity is employed and it contributes to the load-bearing
   capacity under both service and ultimate conditions. This is an ideal
   technique because it combines the advantage of using noncorrosive and
   lightweight advanced composite materials in the form of bonded FRP
   laminates with the high efficiency offered by external prestressing. An
   innovative mechanical anchorage system was developed to prestress the
   FRP laminates directly by jacking and reacting against the steel girder
   itself. The efficiency of the system was investigated using two types of
   FRP laminates for flexural strengthening of large-scale steel-concrete
   composite girders. The used FRP composite materials included
   carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) plate and steel-fiber-reinforced
   polymer (SFRP) sheets. The developed anchorage/prestressing system was
   easy to use/apply and proved to be a feasible and practical system for
   prestressing both CFRP plate and SFRP sheet. The prestressing levels in
   the FRP laminates were sufficiently maintained. The prestressing losses
   were insignificant. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Participation in gymnastics prior to puberty offers an intriguing and
   unique model, particularly in girls. The individuality comes from both
   upper and lower limbs being exposed to high mechanical loading through
   year long intensive training programs, initiated at a young age.
   Studying this unique model and the associated changes in musculoskeletal
   health during growth is an area of specific interest. Previous reviews
   on gymnastics participation and bone health have been broad; and not
   limited to a particular maturation period, such as pre-puberty.
   Objectives: To determine the difference in skeletal health between
   pre-pubertal girls participating in gymnastics compared with
   non-gymnasts.
   Design: Meta-analysis.
   Methods: Following a systematic search, 17 studies were included in this
   meta-analysis. All studies used dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry to
   assess bone mineral density and bone mineral content. In addition, two
   studies included peripheral quantitative computed tomography.
   Results: Following the implementation of a random effects model,
   gymnasts were found to have greater bone properties than non-gymnasts.
   The largest difference in bone health between gymnasts and non-gymnasts
   was observed in peripheral quantitative computed tomography-derived
   volumetric bone mineral density at the distal radius (d = 1.06).
   Conclusions: Participation in gymnastics during pre-pubertal growth was
   associated with skeletal health benefits, particularly to the upper
   body. (C) 2012 Sports Medicine Australia. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{The Effects of Wedged Footwear on Lower Limb Frontal Plane Biomechanics
   During Running}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL JOURNAL OF SPORT MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{208-215}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS), the most common running
   injury, has been associated with increased internal knee abduction
   angular impulses (KAAI). Wedged footwear can reduce these impulses
   during walking, but their effects during running are not well
   understood. The purpose of this study was to identify the effects of
   wedged footwear on KAAIs and describe the mechanism by which wedged
   footwear alters KAAIs during running.
   Design: Controlled laboratory study.
   Setting: Motion analysis laboratory.
   Participants: Nine healthy male subjects.
   Interventions: Participants ran at a speed of 4 m/s with 7 different
   footwear conditions (3-, 6-, and 9-mm lateral wedges; 3-, 6-, and 9-mm
   medial wedges; neutral).
   Main Outcome Measures: Knee abduction angular impulses and 8 predictor
   variables were measured and compared by 1-way repeated measures analysis
   of variance (alpha = 0.05) with Bonferroni-adjusted 2-tailed paired t
   tests for post hoc analysis (alpha = 0.002). Correlation (alpha = 0.05)
   was used to determine the relationship between the mediolateral center
   of pressure to ankle joint center (COP-AJC) lever arm length and KAAIs.
   Results: Laterally wedged conditions produced significantly lower KAAIs
   (P = 0.001) than medial wedge conditions. Peak knee abduction moments
   decreased (P = 0.001), whereas ankle inversion moments (P = 0.041) and
   the COP-AJC lever arms increased (P < 0.001) as wedges progressed from
   medial to lateral. KAAIs were negatively correlated with COP-AJC lever
   arm length (r = -0.50, P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: KAAIs are reduced with laterally wedged footwear because of
   lateral shifts in the center of pressure beneath the foot, which then
   increases ankle inversion moments and decreases peak knee abduction
   moments. Laterally wedged footwear may therefore offer greater relief to
   runners with PFPS than medially wedged footwear by reducing KAAIs.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we describe a condition classification technique designed
   to detect fault occurrence in an automotive light assembly during
   endurance testing. Inputs to the classifier are features extracted from
   vibration measurement data. They contain time domain parameters and
   frequency band energy parameters calculated using wavelet packet
   transforms. A support vector machine with Gaussian radial basis function
   kernel is designed for multiclass classification. A multiplex parameter
   estimation is achieved by searching for a minimum bound of the support
   vector count to achieve structural risk minimization. Through
   experiments, we show that the combination of effective feature
   extraction and classification with good generalization capability allows
   the proposed condition-monitoring system to be accurate and reliable.
   Additionally, acoustic signals known to have low signal to noise ratio
   are used as tests. We show that with the proposed methodology, acoustic
   signals can be used with increased sensitivity and accuracy for
   condition-monitoring purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Concerns about the specificity and reliability of artificial neural
   networks (ANNs) impede further application of ANNs in medicine. This is
   particularly true when developing computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools
   using ANNs for orphan diseases and emerging research areas where only a
   small-sized sample set is available. It is unreasonable to claim one
   ANN's performance as better than another simply on the basis of a single
   output without considering possible output variability due to factors
   including data noise and ANN training protocols. In this paper, a
   bootstrap resampling method is proposed to quantitatively analyze ANN
   output reliability and changing performance as the sample data and
   training protocols are varied. The method is tested in the area of
   feature classification for analysis of masses detected on mammograms.
   Our experiments show that ANNs performance, measured in terms of the
   area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, is not a
   fixed value, but follows a distribution function sensitive to many
   factors. We demonstrate that our approach to determining the bootstrap
   estimates of confidence intervals (CIs) and prediction intervals (PIs)
   can be used to assure optimal performance in terms of ANN model
   configuration. We also show that the unintentional inclusion of data
   noise, which biases ANN results in small task-specific databases, can be
   accurately detected via the bootstrap estimates. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

   Thus, our objective was to determine if bone microarchitecture measured
   with HR-pQCT and FE estimates of bone strength could classify women with
   and without low-trauma fractures.
   We used HR-pQCT to assess bone microarchitecture at the distal radius
   and tibia in 44 postmenopausal women with a history of low-trauma
   fracture and 88 age-matched controls from the Calgary cohort of the
   Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study (CaMos) study. We estimated bone
   strength using FE analysis and simulated distal radius aBMD from the
   HR-pQCT scans. Femoral neck (FN) and lumbar spine (LS) aBMD were
   measured with DXA. We used support vector machines (SVM) and a tenfold
   cross-validation to classify the fracture cases and controls and to
   determine accuracy.
   The combination of HR-pQCT measures of microarchitecture and FE
   estimates of bone strength had the highest area under the receiver
   operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.82 when classifying forearm
   fractures compared to an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.71 from
   DXA-derived aBMD of the forearm and 0.63 from FN and spine DXA. For all
   fracture types, FE estimates of bone strength at the forearm alone
   resulted in an AUC of 0.69.
   Models based on HR-pQCT measurements of bone microarchitecture and
   estimates of bone strength performed better than DXA-derived aBMD at
   classifying women with and without prior fracture. In future, these
   models may improve prediction of individuals at risk of low-trauma
   fracture.}},

Title = {{A comparison between constant volume induction times and results from
   spatially resolved simulation of ignition behind reflected shocks:
   implications for shock tube experiments}},
Journal = {{SHOCK WAVES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{23}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The induction time measured in shock tube experiments is typically
   converted into kinetic data assuming that the reaction takes place in a
   constant volume process, thus neglecting spatial gradients. The actual
   process of shock ignition is, however, both time- and space-dependent;
   ignition takes place at a well-defined location, and subsequently a
   front travels, which may couple with the pressure wave that it created
   and forms a detonation wave behind the shock that reflects off the wall.
   To assess how different the actual processes are compared with the
   constant volume assumption, a numerical study was performed using a
   simplified three step chain-branching kinetic scheme. To overcome the
   difficulties that arise when simulating shock-induced ignition due to
   the initial absence of a domain filled with shocked reactive mixture,
   the problem is solved in a transformed frame of reference. Furthermore,
   initial conditions are derived from short-time asymptotics, which
   resolves the initial singularity. The induction times obtained using the
   full unsteady formulation with those of the homogeneous explosion are
   compared for various values of the heat release. Results for the
   spatially dependent formulation show that the evolution of the
   post-shock flow is complex, and that it leads to a gradient in induction
   times, after the passage of the reflected shock. For all cases
   simulated, thermal explosion initially occurs very close to the wall,
   and the corresponding induction time is found to be larger than that
   predicted under the constant volume assumption. As the measurement is
   made further away however, the actual time interval between passage of
   the reflected shock, and the specified pressure increase denoting
   ignition, decreases to a value close to zero, corresponding to that
   obtained along a Rayleigh line matching that of a steady ZND process
   (assuming a long enough tube). In situations where the constant volume
   assumption is expected to be weak, more accurate kinetic data will be
   obtained using a spatially resolved computation such as the one used in
   the current comparison.}},

Abstract = {{Software testing is an important activity in the software development
   life-cycle. In an earlier study in 2009, we reported the results of a
   regional survey of software testing practices among practitioners in the
   Canadian province of Alberta. To get a larger nationwide view on this
   topic (across Canada), we conducted a newer survey with a revised list
   of questions in 2010. Compared to our previous Alberta-wide survey (53
   software practitioners), the nation-wide survey had larger number of
   participants (246 practitioners). We report the survey design, execution
   and results in this article. The survey results reveal important and
   interesting findings about software testing practices in Canada.
   Whenever possible, we also compare the results of this survey to other
   similar studies, such as the ones conducted in the US, Sweden and
   Australia, and also two previous Alberta-wide surveys, including our
   2009 survey. The results of our survey will be of interest to testing
   professionals both in Canada and world-wide. It will also benefit
   researchers in observing the latest trends in software testing industry
   identifying the areas of strength and weakness, which would then
   hopefully encourage further industry-academia collaborations in this
   area. Among the findings are the followings: (1) the importance of
   testing-related training is increasing, (2) functional and unit testing
   are two common test types that receive the most attention and efforts
   spent on them, (3) usage of the mutation testing approach is getting
   attention among Canadian firms, (4) traditional Test-last Development
   (TLD) style is still dominating and a few companies are attempting the
   new development approaches such as Test-Driven Development (TDD), and
   Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), (5) in terms of the most popular test
   tools, NUnit and Web application testing tools overtook JUnit and IBM
   Rational tools, (6) most Canadian companies use a combination of two
   coverage metrics: decision (branch) and condition coverage, (7) number
   of passing user acceptance tests and number of defects found per day
   (week or month) are regarded as the most important quality assurance
   metrics and decision factors to release, (8) in most Canadian companies,
   testers are out-numbered by developers, with ratios ranging from 1:2 to
   1:5, (9) the majority of Canadian firms spent less than 40\% of their
   efforts (budget and time) on testing during development, and (10) more
   than 70\% of respondents participated in online discussion forums
   related to testing on a regular basis. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Char gasification has been studied in different ways with different

   gasification with different partial pressure of CO2, different
   temperature and particle size. Results showed that 375-mu m particle
   sizes of char has higher reactivity compared to other particle sizes and
   the inhibition effect was also less at 375-mu m particle size. Kinetic
   parameters varied for gasification reaction with different particle
   sizes and the average activation energy was 196kJ/mol and the order of
   the reaction was approximately 1. Inhibition studies with the addition
   of CO in the gasifying agent proved that CO molecules interfere
   significantly and reduced the reactivity. ANOVA test showed that the
   temperature plays a vital role in char reactivity. The particle sizes of

Abstract = {{A wireless sensor network (WSN) comprises a large number of wireless
   sensor nodes. Wireless sensor nodes are battery-powered devices with
   limited processing and transmission power. Therefore, energy consumption
   is a critical issue in system designs of WSNs. In-network data fusion
   and clustering have been shown to be effective techniques in reducing
   energy consumption in WSNs. However, clustering can introduce
   bottlenecks to a network, which causes extra delays in a data
   aggregation process. The problem will be more severe when in-network
   data fusion does not yield any size reduction in outgoing data. Such
   problems can be greatly alleviated by modifying the network structure.
   In this paper, a delay-aware network structure for WSNs with in-network
   data fusion is proposed. The proposed structure organizes sensor nodes
   into clusters of different sizes so that each cluster can communicate
   with the fusion center in an interleaved manner. An optimization process
   is proposed to optimize intra-cluster communication distance. Simulation
   results show that, when compared with other existing aggregation
   structures, the proposed network structure can reduce delays in data
   aggregation processes and keep the total energy consumption at low
   levels provided that data are only partially fusible.}},

Abstract = {{An investigation into an extraction of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)
   from transformer oil (TO) using different solvents and its
   dechlorination with visible light was conducted. The extraction
   experiments showed that dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was the preferable
   solvent for extraction of PCBs from TO, with an average of 88.79\%
   recovery. Multicycle extractions using DMSO led to 87.93, 11.22, and
   0.77\% PCBs recovery during the first, second, and third cycles,
   respectively. Optimization studies indicated that for TO with low
   concentrations of PCBs, a 5-min shaking time, and a DMSO to TO ratio of
   6:1 is optimal. For higher concentrations of PCBs in TO, the optimum
   conditions were 30 min of shaking time with a DMSO to TO ratio of 6:1.
   Furthermore, water aids in the extraction. PCBs were effectively
   dechlorinated using visible light in conjunction with sodium
   borohydride, NaBH4, as a reducing agent. The presence of DMSO did not
   seem to interfere with the dechlorination. DOI:

Abstract = {{Dynamic site layout planning is the task of determining the overall
   optimum location of objects such as temporary facilities, storage areas,

   innovative dynamic model that is able to generate layouts that are
   optimized over the duration of the project. The model applies energy
   principles governing a physical system to search for the optimum
   location of objects. In this model, objects with more impact on the
   layout are able to obtain and reserve their optimum locations even if
   they arrive to the construction site in later stages. The model
   allocates space to objects only for the duration they are required on
   the site, and accordingly, it enables a realistic representation of
   space availability on the site and allows the reuse of space over the
   time. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the capability of
   the developed model. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The application of nanoparticles as a catalyst in porous media has
   recently been increased and is generally relevant to applications that
   include in situ heavy oil upgrading and removal of reactive and
   non-reactive pollutants in groundwater. The objective of this paper is
   investigation of the effects of reactive nano-catalysts on viscous
   fingering instability. In order to understand the behaviour of frontal
   instabilities during transport of reactive nanoparticles, the basic
   equations of conservation of mass and momentum are linearized and solved
   numerically. The analysis reveals that increasing the reaction rate
   promotes the viscous fingering instability around an interface
   delivering nano-catalysts, while increasing the nano-catalysts
   deposition rate usually stabilizes the displacement front. It is also
   shown that accumulation of nano-catalysts behind the front can
   destabilize the reactive front. The effects of the interface sharpness,
   nanoparticles diffusion coefficient, permeability of porous media, and
   viscosity ratios of different phases are also discussed. (c) 2012

Title = {{A Comparison of Orthopaedic Resident Performance on Surgical Fixation of
   an Ulnar Fracture Using Virtual Reality and Synthetic Models}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BONE AND JOINT SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{95A}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Surgical trainees develop surgical skills using various
   techniques, with simulators providing a safe learning environment.
   Fracture fixation is the most common procedure in orthopaedic surgery,
   and residents may benefit from simulated fracture fixation. The
   performance of residents on a virtual simulator that allows them to
   practice the surgical fixation of fractures by providing a sense of
   touch (haptics) has not yet been compared with their performance using
   other methods of practicing fracture fixation, such as a Sawbones
   simulator model. The purpose of this study was to assess whether
   residents performed similarly on a newly developed virtual simulator
   compared with a Sawbones simulator fracture fixation model.
   Methods: A stratified, randomized controlled study involving twenty-two
   orthopaedic surgery residents was performed. The residents were
   randomized to first perform surgical fixation of the ulna on either the
   virtual or the Sawbones simulator, after which they performed the same
   procedure on the other simulator. Their performance was evaluated by
   examiners experienced in fracture fixation who completed a task-specific
   checklist, global rating scale (GRS) form, and time-to-completion record
   for each participant on each simulator.
   Results: Both simulators distinguished between differing experience
   levels, demonstrating construct validity; for the Sawbones simulator,
   the Cohen d value (effect size) was >0.90, and for the virtual
   simulator, d was >1.10 (p < 0.05 for both). The participants achieved
   significantly better scores on the virtual simulator compared with the
   Sawbones simulator (p < 0.05) for all measures except time to
   completion. The GRS scores showed a high level of internal consistency
   (Cronbach alpha, >0.80). However, Pearson product-moment correlation
   analysis showed no significant correlations between the results on the
   two simulators; therefore, concurrent validity was not achieved.
   Conclusions: The newly developed virtual ulnar surgical fixation
   simulator, which incorporates haptics, shows promise for helping
   surgical trainees learn and practice basic skills, but it did not attain
   the same standards as the current standard Sawbones simulator. The
   procedural measures used to assess resident performance demonstrated
   good reliability and validity, and both the Sawbones and the virtual
   simulator showed evidence of construct validity.}},

Abstract = {{The economic and economic-statistical designs of an (X) over bar control
   chart for two-identical unit series systems with condition-based
   maintenance is studied in this paper. This system is described using a
   five-state continuous time Markov chain. We assume that the system is
   monitored by an (X) over bar control chart to avoid costly failures.
   When the control chart gives an out-of-control signal, a full inspection
   will be conducted to confirm the actual system condition. Moreover, we
   assume that the system unit can be preventively replaced at a sampling
   epoch and must be replaced upon failure; the cost of preventive
   replacement is less than that of failure replacement. In addition, a
   random shift size is considered for two types of design. Based on these
   assumptions and by using renewal theory, optimization models have been
   developed to find the optimal control chart parameters for minimizing
   the average maintenance costs. A numerical example is presented to
   compare the two control chart designs. We also consider the effect of
   each statistical constraint on the decision variables and on the
   expected cost. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a novel testing system that allows quantification of joint
   loading and permits analysis of changes in total protein and PRG4
   contents in joint fluid of intact knees in live mice. A sequence of 15
   repeat, isometric muscular contractions of ``low{''} intensity (less
   than 50\% of the maximal isometric muscular force), and ``high{''}
   intensity (greater than 55\% of maximal) were applied repeatedly (up to
   five times with a 15 mm rest between contractions) to the mouse knee.
   Increases in knee joint loading were accompanied with significant
   increases in total protein (p < 0.0001) and PRG4 concentrations in the
   synovial fluid. Total protein and PRG4 concentrations decreased with
   repeated ``high{''} intensity loading. However, the addition of cell
   secretion inhibitors to the knee prior to muscular loading resulted in
   PRG4 levels that remained below the detection limit for all loading
   conditions.
   These results suggest that changes in synovial fluid proteins and PRG4
   concentrations upon joint loading are mediated by cells within the
   joint, and that these changes may be used as quantitative indicators for
   the intensity and duration of acute joint loading, and might serve as a
   powerful clinical tool to assess the effectiveness of rehabilitation and
   prevention exercise programs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1231-1236}},
Month = {{APR 26}},
Abstract = {{Finite element (FE) analysis based on quantitative computed tomography
   (QCT) images is an emerging tool to estimate bone strength in a specific
   patient or specimen; however, it is limited by the computational power
   required and the associated time required to generate and solve the
   models. Thus, our objective was to develop a fast, validated method to
   estimate whole bone structural stiffness and failure load in addition to
   a sensitivity analysis of varying boundary conditions. We performed QCT
   scans on twenty fresh-frozen proximal femurs (age: 77 +/- 13 years) and
   mechanically tested the femurs in a configuration that simulated a
   sideways fall on the hip. We used custom software to generate the FE
   models with boundary conditions corresponding to the mechanical tests
   and solved the linear models to estimate bone structural stiffness and
   estimated failure load. For the sensitivity analysis, we varied the
   internal rotation angle of the femoral neck from -30 degrees to 45
   degrees at 15 degrees intervals and estimated structural stiffness at
   each angle. We found both the FE estimates of structural stiffness
   (R-2=0.89, p<0.01) and failure load (R-2=0.81, p<0.01) to be in high
   agreement with the values found by mechanical testing. An important
   advantage of these methods was that the models of approximately 500,000
   elements took less than 11 min to solve using a standard desktop
   workstation. In this study we developed and validated a method to
   quickly and accurately estimate proximal femur structural stiffness and
   failure load using QCT-driven FE methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{APR 8}},
Abstract = {{Our objective was the determination of understory grass greening stage
   (GGS: defined as the date when 75\% of the grass in the surrounding area
   of a particular location would be green) using remote sensing data over
   the boreal-dominant forested regions in the Canadian province of
   Alberta. We used moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer
   (MODIS)-derived accumulated growing degree days (AGDD) and normalized
   difference water index (NDWI) with ground-based understory GGS
   observations at approximately 120 lookout tower sites during the period
   2006 to 2008. During 2006, we extracted the temporal dynamics of
   AGDD/NDWI at the lookout tower sites and determined the best thresholds
   (i.e., 90 degree-days for AGDD and 0.45 for NDWI). These AGDD/NDWI
   thresholds were then implemented during 2007 and 2008; and observed that
   AGDD had better prediction capabilities in comparison to NDWI (i.e.,
   similar to 94\% and similar to 65\% of the incidents fall within +/- 2

Abstract = {{Knee kinematics provide information about how the femoral, tibial and
   patellar bones or prosthetic components move relative to each other.
   Accurate knowledge of kinematics is valuable for implant design,
   comparisons between designs or surgical techniques, and to identify
   differences between patients with good and poor outcomes. Both static
   and dynamic imaging techniques have been used to evaluate kinematics. In
   general, static imaging is used to capture better quality images or to
   capture views that cannot be acquired by dynamic imaging, whereas
   dynamic imaging is used to capture real-life movements. How well static
   kinematics represent dynamic kinematics is subject to frequent debate
   and has not been adequately addressed, especially after total knee
   arthroplasty (WA). We compared the static and dynamic weightbearing
   kinematics of 10 female subjects after TKA. Using the same clinical
   scanner for both methods, static images were taken using our standard
   protocol, sequential-biplane radiographs at multiple flexion angles, as
   well as with dynamic video fluoroscopy during a step up activity. The
   static method can reliably measure all 12 degrees of freedom (DOF) after
   TKA, however only seven were compared due to the poorer out-of-plane
   reliability in the single-plane dynamic imaging. No differences were
   found between the static and dynamic kinematics for nine out of ten
   subjects. For one subject, however, a difference of 5-8 degrees in
   internal/external tibial rotation was found. The research question,
   study purpose and the advantages and disadvantages of each method need
   to be considered when determining which imaging method to use. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The steam gasification of biomass in the presence of calcium oxide
   offers a viable route for the dual purpose of hydrogen production and

   thermodynamic or kinetic simulation. In this study, the thermodynamic
   and kinetic simulation of the CO2 capture process using two
   calcium-based sorbents (i.e., Imasco dolomite and Cadomin limestone)
   have been studied using Aspen Plus software. The thermodynamic
   simulation was able to predict the overall trend of the CO2 adsorption
   on dolomite and limestone. However, a kinetic model was also applied to
   achieve a more accurate analysis. The results show good agreement
   between the modeling and the experimental data obtained using a
   thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). A shift in the reaction mechanism was
   observed with respect to temperature. The experimental data and kinetic
   model illustrated that the maximum conversion occurred at 650 degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{Steadily improving performance of inertial sensors necessitates
   significant enhancement of the methods and equipment used for their
   evaluation. As the nonlinearity of sensors decreases and gets close to
   that of the exciters, new challenges arise. One of them, addressed in
   this research, is a superposition of errors caused by the nonlinearity
   of tested devices with nonlinear distortions of excitation employed for
   experimental evaluation. This can lead to a cancellation, at least
   partial, of the effects of both imperfections and underestimation of the
   actual distortions of the evaluated sensors. We implement and analyze
   several system architectures and evaluate components of applicable
   motion generation systems from the viewpoint of satisfying the relevant,
   often conflicting requirements posed by the evaluation of high
   performance inertial sensors. Robust mechanical integration of the
   guidance, actuation, and measurement functions emerges as a key factor
   for achieving the needed quality of generated test patterns. We find
   precision air bearing stages, such as ABL1500 series (Aerotech) most
   suitable for implementing the needed experimental setup. We propose an
   architecture with two reciprocating stages, implement and evaluate its
   core components, and illustrate its performance with experimental
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Pile load tests using Osterberg cells (O-cell) were conducted on
   cast-in-place concrete piles founded in oil sand fill and in situ oil
   sand at an industrial plant site in Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada.
   Interpreted pile test results show that very high pile shaft resistance
   (with the Bjerrum-Burland or Beta coefficient of 2.5-4.5) against oil
   sand could be mobilized at small relative displacements of 2-3\% of
   shaft diameter. Finite element simulations based on linear elastic and
   elasto-plastic models for oil sand materials were used to analyze the
   pile load test measurements. Two constitutive models yield comparable
   top-down load versus pile head displacement curves, but very different
   behaviour in mobilization of pile shaft and end bearing resistances. The
   elasto-plastic model produces more consistent matching in both pile
   shaft and end bearing resistances whereas the linear elastic under-and
   over-predicts the shaft and end bearing resistances, respectively. The
   mobilization of high shaft resistance in oil sand under pile load is
   attributed to the very dense and interlocked structure of oil sand which
   results in high matrix stiffness, high friction angle, and high shear
   dilation.}},

Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{Dual-porosity (DP) models have been extensively used to simulate the
   flow of fluids (water or gas) in aggregate soils and fractured porous
   media. The fluid exchange between the rock matrix blocks and the
   fracture network is very important in DP models. In this study, we
   present semianalytical solutions for release of a single-phase liquid or
   gas from cylindrical and spherical matrix blocks with various block size
   distributions and different pressure depletion regimes in the fracture.
   The nonlinear pressure diffusivity equations for flow of gas and air are
   solved analytically using an approximate integral method. It is shown
   that this solution can be simplified to model flow of slightly
   compressible fluids like water in DP media. The effect of variable block
   size distribution on the release rate for different block geometries is
   studied. Practically it is not feasible to model a large-scale fractured
   reservoir based on a fine grid approach due to the requirement of large
   computational time. The presented semianalytical model can be
   incorporated into numerical models for accurate modeling of the amount
   of transferred fluid between matrix and fractures using a DP approach.
   It is shown that the results calculated by the developed model match
   well with those from fine grid numerical simulations. Furthermore, the
   developed model can recover the available solutions in the literature
   for slightly compressible fluids such as water or oil. It can be used to
   calculate two- or three-dimensional flows in matrix blocks bounded by
   two or three sets of fractures, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Schedule compression is an attempt to reduce project durations for early
   delivery, or to catch up on occurred delays. This is usually performed
   using ``crashing{''}, ``overlapping{''} and ``substitution{''} of
   activities. ``Crashing{''} is shortening task duration by adding more
   resource hours. ``Substitution{''} is changing the method or tool by
   which the activity is performed. ``Overlapping{''} is performing
   sequential activities in parallel. Few studies can be found in the
   literature that compare costs and benefits of each technique and
   recommend the optimum combination of these techniques in project
   schedules. In fact, the implications of each technique are inherently
   different since crashing and substitution impose extra cost whereas
   overlapping adds the risk of changes and rework. Therefore, it is a
   challenge to develop a reliable analytical tool for performing time-cost
   trade-offs using the three methods. There are also few studies in the
   literature to propose a practical method for performing schedule
   compression by combining these techniques. The purpose of this paper is
   to discuss these schedule compression techniques in detail, and present
   and validate a heuristic method to perform the combination of crashing,
   overlapping and substitution in a project schedule, to reach the maximum
   benefit while meeting the project target dates.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to present statistical models of costs
   based on new data obtained from manufacturers of a menu of treatment
   technologies suitable for small water systems. This analysis would be of
   interest to water management engineers and planners. We classify these
   technologies into six classes, depending on the contaminants removed.
   Our statistical results show that average costs (including capital,
   operating and maintenance) of production of these technologies depend on
   the flow rate as well as the number of contaminants removed. The larger
   the flow rate the lower the cost per volume treated and the more
   contaminants are removed, the higher the cost, for any given flow rate.
   One of our major finding is that for surface waters except those with
   high color and turbidity, UV-based treatment technologies can be cost
   effective. However, for any particular system, water engineers would
   take site-specific features into account to determine what technology is
   most appropriate.}},

   center frequency can be controlled with a precision of approximate to
   0.2\% while the bandwidth can be controlled with a precision of

Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Dead-reckoning (DR) algorithms, which use self-contained inertial
   sensors combined with gait analysis, have proven to be effective for
   pedestrian navigation purposes. In such DR systems, the primary error is
   often due to accumulated heading drifts. By tightly integrating global
   navigation satellite system (GNSS) Doppler measurements with DR, such
   accumulated heading errors can usually be accurately compensated. Under
   weak signal conditions, high sensitivity GNSS (HSGNSS) receivers with
   block processing techniques are often used, however, the Doppler quality
   of such receivers is relatively poor due to multipath, fading and signal
   attenuation. This often limits the benefits of integrating HSGNSS
   Doppler with DR. This paper investigates the benefits of using Doppler
   measurements from a novel direct vector HSGNSS receiver with pedestrian
   dead-reckoning (PDR) for indoor navigation. An indoor signal and
   multipath model is introduced which explains how conventional HSGNSS
   Doppler measurements are affected by indoor multipath. Velocity and
   Doppler estimated by using direct vector receivers are introduced and
   discussed. Real experimental data is processed and analyzed to assess
   the veracity of proposed method. It is shown when integrating HSGNSS
   Doppler with PDR algorithm, the proposed direct vector method are more
   helpful than conventional block processing method for the indoor
   environments considered herein.}},

Abstract = {{A theoretical model for fluid mixing in steady and transient
   buoyancy-driven flows induced by laminar natural convection in porous
   layers is presented. This problem follows a highly nonlinear dynamics
   and its accurate modeling poses numerical challenges. Based on the
   Taylor dispersion theory, a one-dimensional analytical model is
   developed for steady and transient velocity fields. To investigate
   steady-state mixing, a unicellular steady velocity field is established
   by maintaining a thermal gradient across a porous layer of finite
   thickness. A passive tracer is then introduced into the flow field and
   the mixing process is studied. In the case of transient flows, as the
   convective flow grows and decays with time the behavior of the
   dispersion coefficient is characterized by a four-parameter Weibull
   function. The simple analytical model developed here can recover scaling
   relations that have been reported in the literature to characterize the
   mixing process in steady and transient buoyancy-driven flows. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The Expanded Fluid (EF) viscosity model for Newtonian fluids is extended
   to crude oils characterized as mixtures of defined components and pseudo
   components The EF models take the fluid density, dilute gas viscosity,
   pressure, and fluid composition as inputs and requires three fluid
   specific parameters, c(2), c(3), and rho(s)degrees, for the fluid or its
   components. Generally, experimental viscosity data are required to
   determine these values for each component In this study, an internally
   consistent estimation method was developed to predict the fluid specific
   parameters of the model for hydrocarbons when no experimental viscosity
   data are available. The method uses n-paraffins as the reference system
   and correlates the fluid specific parameters for hydrocarbons as
   departures from the reference system. The method was evaluated against
   viscosity data of over 250 pure hydrocarbon compounds and petroleum
   distillation cuts. The model predictions were within the same order of
   magnitude of the measurements, with an overall average absolute relative
   deviation of 31\%. The method was then used to calculate the correlation
   parameters for the pseudo-components of nine dead and live oils
   characterized on the basis of their gas chromatography (GC) assays. The
   viscosities of the crude oils were predicted within a factor of 3 of the
   measured values using the measured density of the oils as the input. The
   applicability of the EF model was also demonstrated using the densities
   determined with the Peng-Robinson equation of state. A simple method was
   proposed to tune the model to available viscosity data using a single
   multiplier to the c(2) parameter (and also to c(3) and rho(s)degrees if
   necessary) of the pseudo-components. Single-parameter tuning of the
   model improved the viscosity prediction for the characterized oils to
   within 30\% of the measured values.}},

Abstract = {{The deposition of solids from two-phase waxy mixtures (comprising a
   multicomponent paraffinic wax dissolved in a multicomponent solvent and
   water) was studied under turbulent flow conditions in a flow -loop
   apparatus, incorporating a cocurrent double pipe heat exchanger. The
   deposition experiments were performed with 6 mass \% wax solutions,
   containing 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 vol \% water, at different flow
   rates over 5600 < Re < 25 300, and at different hot and cold stream
   temperatures. In the bench-scale apparatus, the deposit was formed
   rapidly such that a thermal steady state was attained within 10-20 min
   in all experiments. The water content of the deposit was found to be not
   related to the water content of the waxy mixture. The deposit mass was
   found to decrease with an increase in Re, the waxy mixture temperature,
   and/or the coolant temperature. The deposit mass also increased as the
   water content of the waxy mixture was increased to about 10 vol \% and
   decreased thereafter. The deposition data, analyzed with a steady-state
   heat-transfer model, indicated that the liquid-deposit interface
   temperature was close to the wax appearance temperature of the waxy

Abstract = {{High Temperature Simulated Distillation (HTSD) is routinely carried out
   in petroleum laboratories for characterization of heavy hydrocarbon
   fractions. However, thermal cracking from HTSD high operating
   temperatures (up to 430 degrees C) has been reported to affect analytes
   during the chromatographic process. This work showed the feasibility of
   using silicone/siloxane depleted stationary phase wide bore capillary
   columns for HTSD carried out under lower setup temperatures to avoid
   cracking. Sequential low temperature elution for analysis followed by
   high temperature oven cycles for injector cleaning were found mandatory
   for successful operation. Depleted stationary phase metal capillary
   columns were determined as a feasible interesting alternative,
   advantageous from the point of view of column life span and retention
   times constancy. Present findings suggest that these columns can have
   useful life in the greater than or equal to a year span. Heavy
   hydrocarbon upgrading monitoring with standard and depleted stationary
   phase metal columns was found equivalent, further supporting the
   feasibility of using the latter for routine applications. X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the internal wall of metal
   columns highlighted differences brought by stationary phase depletion,
   particularly on the silicone/siloxane groups. Finally, preliminary
   results indicated that one further alternative to avoid ``on column{''}
   thermal cracking is to elute standard columns to temperature limits <370
   degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{Many in situ recovery methods have been developed to extract heavy oil
   and bitumen from deep reservoirs. The ``underground refinery{''}
   approach using a nanosize ultradispersed (UD) catalyst is one of the
   alternatives to surface upgrading that may become the ``next
   generation{''} of oil sands industry improvement. Water-in-vacuum gas
   oil microemulsions containing trimetallic (W, Ni, and Mo) ultradispersed
   colloidal nanoparticles could penetrate inside the porous medium and
   react with the bitumen. This study is aimed at developing a
   catalytic-enhanced oil recovery method for Athabasca bitumen recovery
   through the viscosity reduction mechanism with the aid of trimetallic
   nanoparticles. In this study, series of experiments were conducted at a
   pressure of 3.5 MPa, residence time of 36 h, and temperatures from 320
   to 340 degrees C in an oil sands packed bed column. Results of three
   consecutive categories of hot fluid injection (in the presence or
   absence of trimetallic nanoparticles) are presented. For the first
   category, the obtained experimental results showed that the recovery
   curve for vacuum gas oil injection without nanocatalysts was at a
   plateau. In the second series of tests, observations proved that adding
   a certain percentage of pentane enhanced the recovery performance of
   injection tests. The third phase of experiments was conducted in the
   presence of trimetallic nanocatalysts in emulsion with vacuum gas oil.
   Results showed the effectiveness of nanocatalysts for enhancing the
   recovery performance compared with the cases of no nanoparticle
   implementation.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{24-29}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we present conductive filler alignment as a novel
   approach to reduce the dissipation factor of conductive filler/polymer
   composites and to widen the typically narrow concentration window near
   the percolation threshold, which is used to tune the dielectric
   properties, i.e., real permittivity and imaginary permittivity. The
   effects of multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) alignment on the
   dielectric properties for MWCNT/polystyrene composites in the X-band
   (8.2-12.4 GHz) were investigated by comparing the dielectric properties
   of injection moulded samples, where MWCNTs were aligned, versus
   compression moulded samples, where MWCNTs were randomly distributed.
   Raman spectroscopy technique was employed to verify partial alignment of
   MWCNTs in the injection moulded samples. The compression moulded samples
   showed an insulator-conductor transition window at 0.50-2.00 wt\% of
   MWCNT, whereas the injection moulded samples showed a significantly
   wider transition window at 3.50-10.00 wt\% of MWCNT. Broader
   insulator-conductor transition window reduces challenges and risks in
   manipulating conductive filler/polymer composites around the percolation
   threshold to regulate the dielectric properties. Moreover, it was
   observed that MWCNT alignment improved the dielectric properties by
   reducing the dissipation factor. For instance, at MWCNT concentrations
   of 0.50 and 2.00 wt\%, the compression moulded samples showed
   dissipation factors of 0.06 and 0.59, respectively, while the injection
   moulded samples presented the dissipation factors considerably lower and
   equal to 0.01 and 0.18, respectively. This study shows that injection
   moulding process, as an industrial technique, can be employed to improve
   significantly the dielectric properties of conductive filler/polymer
   composites for charge storage applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{275-283}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the results and analysis performed on two types of
   hybrid FRP-UHPC beams, reinforced with either CFRP or SFRP tension
   sheets. The experimental program was conducted in two stages with a
   total of six beams tested. In Stage 1, six full length hybrid beams were
   tested until failure under four-point loading using both monotonic
   static and fatigue loading regimes. Then in Stage 2, the same beams were
   shortened to eliminate the sections of major damage and re-tested to
   determine the post-damage residual strength and behaviour due to
   flexural loading. The results showed that there was no detectable
   difference in the amount of damage sustained under similar loading for
   the two types of hybrid beams tested. Testing of post-damaged beams
   showed a performance level of at least 74\% of the pre-damaged beams,
   thus demonstrating that the hybrid beams are capable of supporting
   considerable loads after sustaining significant damage. Additionally,
   the introduction of compressive clamping forces was found to enhance the
   bond behaviour at material interfaces by promoting frictional forces.
   More experimental testing with additional hybrid beam specimens is
   strongly recommended. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   proven in this work. By using this proposed Akaike information criterion
   (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) criteria, the model order
   selection was cast as a cost minimization problem. To minimize the
   criteria, modified gradient descent and simulated annealing algorithms
   were utilized which resulted in a considerable reduction in the number
   of search iterations. The performances of the criteria were shown by
   comparing the normalized mean square error (NMSE) of a higher-order
   model and the optimum model. It has been shown that the NMSE difference

Abstract = {{Actual bus arrival times often deviate from the posted schedules due to
   a variety of factors; hence, providing real-time bus information can
   improve service quality. This study examined users' views and
   perceptions towards the possible future availability of real-time bus
   information systems in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. A face-to-face
   paper-based survey was conducted to collect the data. Various statistics
   and methods, such as ANOVA tests, ordinal regression and binary logistic
   regression, were used to analyse the data. The results showed that
   35.5\% of the respondents either agreed or strongly agreed that the
   current information system deterred or discouraged them from using
   public transport. In addition, a significant portion of respondents
   (82\%) stated that they board the first arriving bus, even though it may
   take a longer in-vehicle time to complete the trip, because of
   uncertainty regarding the arrival time of the next alternative bus with
   a shorter in-vehicle travel time. A majority of the respondents (88\%)
   indicated that real-time transit information would not be necessary if
   bus headways are less than 10minutes. As for preferred information
   content, information on the next bus arrival time received the highest
   priority. In general, Light Rail Transit (LRT) users showed the least
   interest in real-time information. Women, younger riders, current car
   users and infrequent transit users showed a higher interest in real-time
   information. Display boards at bus stops were perceived to be the most
   preferred medium to get en-route information, whereas a website/call
   centre was stated to be the preferred media for pre-trip information.

Abstract = {{Permeability variation in the presence of gas hydrates (GH) is a major
   unknown in modeling hydrate dissociation in gas-hydrate-bearing
   sediment. Reduction of permeability in porous media occurs as a result
   of decreased porosity because of hydrate formation within pore spaces.
   In the absence of reliable experimental data, theoretical and empirical
   models have been proposed to establish the relationship between
   gas-hydrate saturation and permeability. The effectiveness of a
   particular permeability model in fitting the measured data has largely
   been qualitative through graphical analysis. In contrast, this paper
   introduces a quantitative performance measure to evaluate the
   effectiveness of an individual model in predicting the measured
   permeability. Second, a hybrid approach based on the weighted
   combination of existing permeability models is proposed. Permeability
   measurements from experimental and field studies were used to assess the
   prediction performance of various permeability models and the proposed
   hybrid approach.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the potential increase in precision and accuracy, laser
   technology is not widely used in neurological surgery. This in part
   relates to challenges associated with the early introduction of lasers
   into neurosurgery. Considerable advances in laser technology have
   occurred, which together with robotic technology could create an ideal
   platform for neurosurgical application. In this study, a 980-nm contact
   diode laser was integrated with neuroArm. Preclinical evaluation
   involved partial hepatectomy, bilateral nephrectomy, splenectomy, and
   bilateral submandibular gland excision in a Sprague-Dawley rat model (n
   = 50). Total surgical time, blood loss as weight of surgical gauze
   before and after the procedure, and the incidence of thermal, vascular,
   or lethal injury were recorded and converted to an overall performance
   score. Thermal damage was evaluated in the liver using tissue samples
   stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Clinical studies involved step-wise
   integration of the 980-nm laser system into four neurosurgical cases.
   Results demonstrate the successful integration of contact laser
   technology into microsurgery, with and without robotic assistance. In
   preclinical studies, the laser improved microsurgical performance and
   reduced thermal damage, while neuroArm decreased intra-and intersurgeon
   variability. Clinical studies demonstrate dutility in meningioma
   resection (n = 4). Together, laser and robotic technology offered a more
   consistent, expedient, and precise tool for microsurgery.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of determining the maximum allowable
   speed (V-max) of Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) traversing off-road
   heterogeneous rough/complex terrain. The maximum speed is calculated
   based on online terrain assessment and the vehicle's characteristics;
   this speed achieves the high speed navigation without exceeding a
   predefined allowable range of transmitted force and moments (i.e.,
   moments in the roll and pitch directions) to the vehicle's frame. The
   proposed system enables UGV's to change their speed autonomously and
   transit between terrains with different characteristics (e.g., pavement,
   rocky) safely. This paper proposes a computationally inexpensive
   approach to process acquired data and assess the terrain roughness. The
   proposed Roughness Index (RI) is used to represent the terrain roughness
   on a scale from 0.0 (highly rough to be traversed by a particular
   vehicle) to 1.0 (perfectly flat/smooth surface). A general vehicle model
   (workable for any vehicle size and wheel configuration) is presented in
   this paper. A closed form expression of the maximum allowable vehicle
   speed is developed. Simulation results obtained on real vehicles (e.g.,
   military tank LEOPARD I) show the effect of increasing the number of
   wheels to improve the capability of a ground vehicle to traverse rough
   terrains at high speeds. In addition, the proposed terrain assessment
   system is a key module in UGVs navigation systems enabling them to be
   truly autonomous by providing the navigation system with the necessary
   information for path and speed planning.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of melt mixing conditions on the level of dispersion and
   the aspect ratio of vapor grown carbon nanofibers (VGCNFs) in a
   polystyrene (PS) matrix was studied. Final electrical and
   electromagnetic shielding capabilities in the 0.051.5 GHz frequency
   range are reported and discussed in the light of the composites'
   microstructure. The morphological study was based on analyzing scanning
   electron microscopy and optical microscopy micrographs and measuring the
   VGCNF length as a function of shear mixing conditions. The influence of
   mixing conditions on the microstructure was also indirectly studied by
   analyzing the dynamic mechanical behavior of the composites via
   rheology. Degradation of the VGCNF aspect ratio was found to be a
   function of the mixing energy. VGCNFs lost one-third of their aspect
   ratio under gentle (low shear stress and mixing energy) mixing
   conditions. After VGCNFs had lost 40\% of their aspect ratio, they had
   more resistance to breakage with increase in mixing energy. The
   dispersion of the VGCNFs was remarkably enhanced with increase in mixing
   energy. The percentage of area taken up by big agglomerates in the
   micrographs decreased from 14.1\% to 5.5\% when the mixing energy was
   increased from 100 J mL1 to 453 J mL1. The electrical and
   electromagnetic shielding properties of the 7.5 vol\% VGCNF/PS
   composites were not affected by changing the processing energy because
   the enhancement of VGCNF dispersion with increasing mixing energy was
   accompanied by a loss in nanofiber aspect ratio. (c) 2012 Society of

Abstract = {{The effect of nano-reinforcements on fracture behaviour of bulk epoxy

   energy of the bulk epoxy nanocomposites significantly increased with

   incorporation of nanoclay. Delamination fracture toughness was not
   influenced by the presence of nanoparticles in the matrix. Decreasing
   fibre volume fraction, on the other hand, significantly improved
   interlaminar fracture energy. Rigid fibres in these composites constrict
   the stress field ahead of the crack-tip. Hence, increasing resin content
   enhanced composite delamination energy by increasing the capacity for
   matrix deformation. Interlaminar crack propagation through the composite
   was observed to occur mainly by interfacial failure and matrix cracking.

   Model}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL ECONOMICS}},

Abstract = {{Agent-based market models are in general based on a-priori defined
   supply and demand schemes. Likewise, production models assume that
   prices are known a-priori. In reality prices depend on variable demands
   and supplies, while demand and supply depend on variable prices, and
   these two processes are interconnected. This paper describes a model
   that for the first time simulates a combined agent-based double auction
   market and production model. The model is built around von Neumann
   technology matrices (von Neumann, Rev Econ Stud 13(1):1-9, 1946) which
   provide the links between products. Agents possess one or more
   technologies to produce products from other products. They trade in
   order to acquire the inputs and sell in order to generate revenue, and
   the price is determined by a process of negotiation between buyers and
   sellers. The algorithm of negotiation is based on Cliff's Zero
   Intelligence Plus approach (Cliff, Minimal-intelligence agents for
   bargaining behaviors in market-based environments. Technical report,
   School of Cognitive and Computing Sciences, University of Sussex, 1997),
   but instead of a single commodity with fixed limit prices the agents
   change their limit prices for multiple products based on the simulated
   economic situation. The combination of production and market provides a
   simple but complete bottom-up model framework for microeconomics. As the
   results show, the model employs a price mechanism that results in an
   appropriate allocation of resources without a central command.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive literature review on the fatigue performance of

Abstract = {{Advances in signal processing techniques contributed to the significant
   improvements of GNSS receiver performance in dense multipath
   environments and created the opportunities for a new category of
   high-sensitivity GNSS (HS-GNSS) receivers that can provide GNSS location
   services in indoor environments. The difficulties in improving the
   availability, reliability, and accuracy of these indoor capable GNSS
   receivers exceed those of the receivers designed for the most hostile
   urban canyon environments. The authors of this paper identified the
   vector tracking schemes, signal propagation statistics, and parallel
   processing techniques that are critical to a robust HS-GNSS receiver for
   indoor environments and successfully incorporated them into a fully
   functional high-sensitivity software receiver. A flexible vector-based
   receiver architecture is introduced to combine these key indoor signal
   processing technologies into GSNRx-hs (TM) - the high sensitivity
   software navigation receiver developed at the University of Calgary. The
   resulting receiver can perform multi-mode vector tracking in indoor
   environment at various levels of location and timing uncertainties. In
   addition to the obvious improvements in time-to-first-fix (TTFF) and
   signal sensitivity, the field test results in indoor environments
   surrounded by wood, glass, and concrete showed that the new techniques
   effectively improved the performance of indoor GNSS positioning. With
   fine GNSS timing, the proposed receiver can consistently deliver indoor
   navigation solution with the horizontal accuracy of 2-15 m depending on
   the satellite geometry and the indoor environments. If only the coarse
   GNSS timing is available, the horizontal accuracy of the indoor
   navigation solution from the proposed receiver is around 30 m depending
   on the coarse timing accuracy, the satellite geometry, and the indoor
   environments. From the preliminary field test results, it has been
   observed that the signal processing sensitivity is the dominant factor
   on the availability of the indoor navigation solution, while the GNSS
   timing accuracy is the dominant factor on the accuracy of the indoor
   navigation solution. (C) 2012 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Stability analysis of two-phase buoyancy-driven flow in the presence of
   a capillary transition zone}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{87}},

Month = {{MAR 13}},
Abstract = {{Natural convection that results from the dissolution of a diffusive
   species into a fluid saturated porous layer in the presence of a
   capillary transition zone is an important phenomenon in geological
   flows. The prediction of the onset of convection has remained elusive
   under the theory of gravitationally unstable multiphase flow in porous
   media. The present study offers a paradigm for the stability of
   two-phase buoyancy-driven flow in the presence of the capillary
   transition zone in a saturated porous medium, which allows for a
   quantitative description of the onset of natural convection. The
   analysis, which is based on the quasi-steady-state approximation,
   stresses the critical role of the capillary transition zone and the
   upward crossflow between the diffusive boundary layer and the capillary
   transition zone in the stability of the system, as well as in the
   transient growth of perturbations. We show that the instability problem
   can be characterized by capillary-dominant and buoyancy-dominant regimes
   with a transition in between. In the capillary-dominant regime,
   capillarity has a strong role in destabilizing the diffusive boundary
   layer. While in the buoyancy-dominant regime, the capillary transition
   zone is small enough that it can be ignored and the buoyancy force is
   the sole cause of the instability. Furthermore, our analysis shows that
   the capillary transition zone can potentially accelerate the evolution
   of the natural convection over 6 times faster than the buoyancy-dominant
   regime. Finally, the nonlinear dynamics of the system is studied using
   direct numerical simulations. The nonlinear simulations confirm the
   predictions from the linear stability analysis. DOI:

Abstract = {{To properly simulate the behavior of biological structures through
   computer modeling, there exists a need to describe parameters that vary
   locally. These parameters can be obtained either from literature or from
   experimental data and they are often assigned to regions in the model as
   lumped values. Furthermore, parameter values may be obtained on a
   representative case and may not be available for each specific modeled
   organ. We describe a semiautomated technique to assign detailed maps of
   local tissue properties to a computational model of a biological
   structure. We applied the method to the left atrium of the heart. The
   orientation of myocytes in the tissue as obtained from histologic
   analysis was transferred to the 3D model of a porcine left atrium.
   Finite element method (FEM) dynamic simulations were performed by using
   an isotropic, neo-Hookean, constitutive model first, then adding an
   anisotropic, cardiomyocyte oriented, Fung-type component. Results showed
   higher stresses for the anisotropic material model corresponding to
   lower stretches in the cardiomyocyte directions. The same methodology
   can be applied to transfer any map of parameters onto a discretized
   finite element model.}},

Title = {{A Simplified Approach to Modeling the Rate of Formation of Gas Hydrates

Journal = {{ENERGY \& FUELS}},
Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Experiments were conducted in a semibatch stirred tank reactor, equipped
   with an in situ particle size analyzer, to study the rate of formation
   of hydrates from mixtures of carbon dioxide and methane. Two gas
   mixtures of CO2 (1) + CH4 (2), one with x(1) = 0.4 and the other with
   x(1) = 0.6, were used in the current study. The experimental temperature
   ranged from 274 to 276 K and the experimental pressure ranged from 20 to
   27 bar absolute. The range of temperatures was bounded by the freezing
   point of water and the temperature at which the CO2 vapor pressure curve
   intersects the methane hydrate curve. Initially, the results were
   analyzed using the kinetic model of Englezos et al. (Chem. Eng. Sri.
   1987, 42, 2659-2666). After a careful re-examination of the model of
   Englezos et al., it was realized that the mathematical model for gas
   hydrate formation from gas mixtures could be simplified by directly
   incorporating the hydrate phase stoichiometry. The new approach has the
   added advantage that the intrinsic rate constant of gas hydrate
   formation is required for only a single component. Thus, a new approach
   was proposed to model the kinetics of gas hydrate formation from a
   mixture of gases, and the results from these predictions were compared
   to the results obtained using the model of Englezos et al. The root-mean
   squares of the relative errors between the experimental results and the
   predictions of the new model and the model of Englezos et al. were found
   to be 2.70\% and 4.29\%, respectively.}},

Title = {{Effects of growth hormone on the ontogenetic allometry of craniofacial

Abstract = {{Organism size is controlled by interactions between genetic and
   environmental factors mediated by hormones with systemic and local
   effects. As changes in size are usually not isometric, a considerable
   diversity in shape can be generated through modifications in the
   patterns of ontogenetic allometry. In this study we evaluated the role
   of timing and dose of growth hormone (GH) release on growth and
   correlated shape changes in craniofacial bones. Using a longitudinal
   study design, we analyzed GH deficient mice treated with GH
   supplementation commencing pre- and post-puberty. We obtained 3D in vivo
   micro-CT images of the skull between 21 and 60 days of age and used
   geometric morphometrics to analyze size and shape changes among control
   and GH deficient treated and non-treated mice. The variable levels of
   circulating GH altered the size and shape of the adult skull, and
   influenced the cranial base, vault, and face differently. While cranial
   base synchondroses and facial sutures were susceptible to either the
   direct or indirect effect of GH supplementation, its effect was
   negligible on the vault. Such different responses support the role of
   intrinsic growth trajectories of skeletal components in controlling the
   modifications induced by systemic factors. Contrary to the expected, the
   timing of GH treatment did not have an effect on catch-up growth. GH
   levels also altered the ontogenetic trajectories by inducing changes in
   their location and extension in the shape space, indicating that
   differences arose before 21 days and were further accentuated by a
   truncation of the ontogenetic trajectories in GHD groups.}},

Title = {{Oil Recovery From Thin Heavy-Oil Reservoirs: The Case of the
   Combined-Thermal-Drive Pilot in the Morgan Field}},

Abstract = {{The Morgan field in Canada produces from the Lloydminster and Sparky
   sands, which are thin heavy-oil reservoirs. Early development of the
   pool was with primary vertical wells in the late 1970s, with some
   enhanced-oil-recovery (EOR) projects {[}e.g., cyclic-steam stimulations
   (CSSs) and in-situ combustion (ISC)] attempted in the early 1980s.
   However, the area was essentially noncommercial after the 1986 oil-price
   collapse. In order to regain commerciality, the operators implemented
   progressing cavity pumps (PCPs) and horizontal drilling, which have
   proved to be a success. Even with these advances, though, recovery is
   estimated to be less than 10\% of the original oil in place (OOIP).
   One of the EOR projects attempted was the combined-thermal-drive (CTD)
   pilot, which was carried out in one of the sections of the field for 10
   years. After a brief primary-production period, the CTD pilot began in
   1980 and consisted of three stages. In the first stage, CSSs were
   performed on individual wells during the first 2 years. In the next 4
   years, air was added to the injection stream to perform cyclic air/steam
   stimulations on individual wells. In the last stage, pressure cycling
   in-situ combustion was performed for approximately 4 years.
   In this paper, historical production and injection records were gathered
   to perform a technical and economic analysis of the project. After
   approximately 20 years since the shutdown of the project, the data
   indicate that this pilot has outperformed all of the other operations
   carried out in other areas of the field. Not only has it produced the
   largest amount of incremental oil of all the sections of the field, but
   it also managed to sustain high production rates for 10 years, which is
   unparalleled in the area. On the economic side, the data indicate that
   the project was experiencing difficulty because of the 1986 oil-price
   collapse. However, an economic analysis under current oil prices and
   costs suggests that it would have been both a technical and an economic
   success.
   This air-injection case history represents a good opportunity for those
   operators facing the challenge to develop thin heavy-oil reservoirs.}},

Title = {{Effect of Natural-Fracture Density on Production Variability. of
   Individual Wells in the Nikanassin Tight Gas Formation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CANADIAN PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{131-143}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A statistical model with a strong correlation has been developed to
   determine average fracture density (FD) on the basis of production
   variability of 271 individual wells producing exclusively from the
   Nikanassin and equivalent formations in a large area of more than 15 000
   km(2) in the western Canada sedimentary basin (WCSB) in Alberta and
   British Columbia.
   Fractional production-variability plots (FPVPs) published by Nelson
   (2001) have been used successfully in the past in many naturally
   fractured reservoirs around the world. Up to now, the generation of such
   graphs has been based on empirical observations from field-production
   data. The variability of the graphs is interpreted qualitatively as a
   measure of reservoir heterogeneities.
   This paper presents a sequential methodology to reproduce empirical
   fractional variability plots of the Nikanassin tight gas formation using
   real data, an empirical variability-distribution model (VDM), and
   dual-porosity numerical simulation. Different simulation approaches and
   multiple sensitivities were generated from the simplest to the
   most-detailed cases to understand what causes the curvature of the FPVP
   in Nikanassin wells. The base simulation case is a homogeneous
   dual-porosity model, where porosity and permeability are set constant
   for matrix and fractures. A second case accounts for a heterogeneous
   dual-porosity model generated through statistical distributions of
   porosity and permeability. Finally, discrete-fracture-network (DFN)
   methodology is used to generate multiple fracture models from which
   stochastic fracture properties are generated for the simulation model.
   It is concluded that curvature of the variability plot is affected
   mainly by the occurrence of natural-fracture density. This finding
   permits estimating FD approximately parallel to the
   northwest/southeast-trending thrust belt of the Canadian Rocky Mountains
   in both the west and the east side of the deformation wedge. An
   unexpected result is that for a significant change in fracture
   permeability and porosity with constant FD, the fractional
   production-variability curve is not affected significantly in the case
   of gas reservoirs. Although the method is applied specifically to the
   Nikanassin tight gas formation, the theory is developed in detail in
   such a way that the methodology can be applied in other tight gas
   reservoirs around the world. Findings from this work are in good
   agreement with the geological description of the Nikanassin formation
   and with a production analysis performed in six Nikanassin study areas
   based on the cumulative number of wells vs. yearly cumulative gas
   production.}},

Title = {{Quantification of small joint space width, periarticular bone
   microstructure and erosions using high-resolution peripheral
   quantitative computed tomography in rheumatoid arthritis}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RHEUMATOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{31}},

Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{Objectives
   This paper aims to investigate the ability of a novel imaging technique,
   high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT),
   to quantify joint space width at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and
   proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints, and provide periarticular bone
   microstructure measurements (including volumetric density and
   morphometric indices). We also compared the sensitivity and specificity
   of HR-pQCT to detect erosions relative to plain radiography.
   Methods
   HR-pQCT imaging of the MCP and PIP joints of the dominant hand was
   performed in 30 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and control subjects matched
   for age, sex and dominant hand use. The joint space width was calculated
   by determining the number of voxels between three-dimensional images of
   the articular surfaces. Periarticular bone microstructure was quantified
   for the 2nd and 3rd MCP joints using standard analysis. The presence of
   erosions was confirmed by viewing both two- and three-dimensional images
   of the joints.
   Results
   Quantitative measures of joint space width and periarticular bone
   microstructure were obtained with precision. Although not powered to
   detect differences between RA and control subjects, we identified a
   trend to narrowing of the 2nd MCP joints in RA (mean difference 250 mu
   m, p=0.057). RA erosions most frequently occurred at the metacarpal head
   of the MCP joint, and HR-pQCT identified erosions in 24.7\% more joints
   compared to plain radiography.
   Conclusion
   This is the first study to exploit the quantitative capabilities of
   HR-pQCT to provide joint space width measurements at the MCP and PIP
   joints. We provide further proof that HR-pQCT improves erosion detection
   and yields reproducible periarticular bone microstructure measurements.}},

Abstract = {{A new experimental apparatus was used to accurately measure the density
   and viscosity of aromatic solvents (toluene and xylenes), of Athabasca
   bitumen, and of their mixtures at different compositions. The
   measurements were taken under conditions applicable for both in situ
   recovery methods and pipeline transportation of heavy oil, that means,
   at temperatures varying from ambient temperature up to 343.15 K and at
   pressures up to 10 MPa and on mixtures with different weight fractions
   of the solvents (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6). The
   experimental density and viscosity data for the solvents and for raw
   bitumen were correlated using different correlation equations from the
   literature. Based on the experimental results, the influence of
   pressure, temperature, and solvent weight fraction on the density and
   viscosity of the mixtures was considered. The experimental density and
   viscosity data for the mixtures of Athabasca bitumen with toluene and
   xylenes were evaluated with predictive schemes as well as with
   correlation models representing certain mixing rules proposed in the
   literature. The density data are well predicted using an equation
   without adjustable parameter in which it is assumed that no volume

   over the studied conditions with Lederer's and power law models which

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{29}},

Pages = {{57-64}},

Abstract = {{Soil organic carbon (SOC) and selected soil properties were measured in
   fringe and ditch marshes and cropland of old and young reclaimed areas
   in a subtropical estuary in China in order to investigate the effects of
   land use and reclamation history on SOC. The results show that after the
   conversion of wetlands to cropland, a longer reclamation history (>20yr)
   resulted in greater soil bulk density, salinity, clay and silt, and
   lower soil moisture, SOC and sand content, whereas a shorter reclamation
   history (<20yr) induced smaller values for soil pH, moisture and sand.
   Ditch marshes had greater average SOC in the top 50cm than fringe
   marshes and cropland. SOC decreased generally down soil profiles from 0
   to 50cm in depth, except for the obvious accumulation of SOC in deeper
   soils from old fringe and young ditch marshes. Ditch marshes had the
   greatest SOC densities in the top 50cm in both regions compared to the
   other land uses. SOC densities in the top 50cm were less in croplands
   than in fringe marshes in the young region, while there were no
   significant differences between them in the older one. Except for
   cropland, SOC densities in the top 50cm of the fringe or ditch marshes
   in the old region were not significantly different from those in the
   young region. SOC in both regions was reduced by 13.53x104 t (12.98\%)
   in the top 50cm of the marshes after conversion to cropland, whereas the
   regional SOC storage increased by 29.25 t when ditch marshes were
   included. The results from regression analysis show that bulk density
   and soil moisture significantly influenced SOC. The total SOC stored in
   both ditch marshes and croplands was higher compared to fringe marshes.
   The regional SOC storage in the top 50cm was not reduced after
   reclamation due to C accumulation in the ditch marshes. The regional
   effects of cultural practices should be taken into account in devising
   strategies for managing soils in coastal wetlands, particularly in the
   developing world.}},

Abstract = {{Bioretention cells are an urban stormwater management technology used to
   address both water quality and quantity concerns. A lack of
   region-specific design guidelines has limited the widespread
   implementation of bioretention cells, particularly in cold climates. In
   this paper, experimental data are used to construct a multiple linear
   regression model to predict hydrological performance of bioretention
   cells. Nine different observed parameters are considered as candidates
   for regressors, of which inlet runoff volume and duration, and initial
   soil moisture were chosen. These three variables are used to construct
   six different regression models, which are tested against the
   observations. Statistical analysis showed that the amount of runoff
   captured by a bioretention cell can be successfully predicted by the
   inlet runoff volume and event duration. Historical data is then used to
   calculate runoff volume for a given duration, in different catchment
   types. This data is used in the regression model to predict bioretention
   cell performance. The results are then used to create a design tool
   which can assist in estimating bioretention cell size to meet different
   performance goals in southern Alberta. Examples on the functionality of
   the design tool are provided.}},

Abstract = {{A new method is developed for the estimation of chemical reaction
   kinetics at high-pressure underground coal gasification from the field
   produced gas composition. This method combines a developed numerical
   forward model and field data to investigate uncertain parameters. The
   forward model is developed on the basis of a unique porous media
   approach that combines the effects of heat, mass transport, and chemical
   reactions to simulate the underground coal gasification in
   three-dimensional basis. The chemical reaction kinetics, that is limited
   to low pressure, is upscaled based on the available experimental data. A
   comprehensive sensitivity analysis is carried out to estimate the
   reaction kinetics and investigate the effect of various parameters, such
   as pressure, temperature, and reaction environment, on the produced gas
   composition. The novelty of the developed method is in its applicability
   as well as its ability to generate the chemical reaction kinetics that
   corresponds to the field under study. The advantage of the proposed
   technique is that the sensitivity of the model to different kinetic
   parameters can be investigated by a graphical method. (C) 2012 The

Abstract = {{Inexpensive millimeter-wavelength (MMW) optical digital imaging raises a
   challenge of evaluating the imaging performance and image quality
   because of the large electromagnetic wavelengths and pixel sensor sizes,
   which are 2 to 3 orders of magnitude larger than those of ordinary
   thermal or visual imaging systems, and also because of the noisiness of
   the inexpensive glow discharge detectors that compose the focal-plane
   array. This study quantifies the performances of this MMW imaging
   system. Its point-spread function and modulation transfer function were
   investigated. The experimental results and the analysis indicate that
   the image quality of this MMW imaging system is limited mostly by the
   noise, and the blur is dominated by the pixel sensor size. Therefore,
   the MMW image might be improved by oversampling, given that noise
   reduction is achieved. Demonstration of MMW image improvement through
   oversampling is presented. (C) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

Title = {{Fusion during entrainment of orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia is
   enhanced for basal pacing sites but diminished when pacing near Purkinje

Journal = {{HEART RHYTHM}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND In the electrophysiological laboratory, orthodromic
   atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia(ORT) can be distinguished
   from atrial tachycardia and atrioventricular node reentry tachycardia by
   identifying orthodromic and antidromic wavefront fusion during
   ventricular overdrive pacing(VOP). Previous work has shown that basal
   VOP near the accessory pathway (AP) increases the likelihood of
   observing fusion; however, in a third of cases, fusion is not
   appreciable regardless of VOP location.
   OBJECTIVE To explore the hypothesis that pacing near His Purkinje
   system(PS) end points reduces fusion quality, which may explain patients
   with nonresponsive ORT.
   METHODS In a novel computer model of ORT, simulations were performed
   with a variety of AP locations and pacing sites; results were analyzed
   to assess factors influencing fusion quality in pseudo-electrocardiogram
   signals.
   RESULTS Entrainment by basal VOP near the AP was more likely to produce
   fusion visible on simulated electrocardiograms compared to entrainment
   by apical VOP, but this advantage was dramatically diminished when the
   pacing site was also near PS end points. Prediction of fusion quality
   based on AP proximity alone was dramatically improved when corrected to
   penalize for PS proximity.
   CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that basal VOP near the AP and far
   from the PS isoptimal; this could be tested inpatients. A denser basal
   ramification of PS fibers is known to exist in a minority of human
   hearts; our findings indicate that this unusual PS configuration is a
   plausible explanation for ORT cases where fusion is never observed in
   spite of entrainment by basal VOP near the AP.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new three-layered biased memory polynomial for
   behavioral modeling and digital predistortion of highly nonlinear
   transmitters/power amplifiers (PAs) for 3G wireless applications. The
   proposed model considers the possibility that the nonlinearity order of
   the dynamic part of the PA characteristics is different from the
   nonlinearity order of the static part. For highly nonlinear PAs, the
   proposed model offers some benefits, such as a low dispersion of
   coefficients, numerical stability and a low number of coefficients.
   Moreover, with the measurement setup, better in-band performance is
   reported. To establish the performance of the linearized PA under
   realistic conditions, experiments have been carried out for a deep
   biased class-AB PA and a Doherty PA for various modeling and signal
   quality norms defined for 3G signals.}},

   mixture of 21\% O-2 in N-2 (dry synthetic air) working at 500-700
   degrees C. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was used to confirm the
   formation of cubic double perovskite-type structure. In situ PXRD
   measurement under CO2 showed excellent chemical stability in the
   temperature range of 25-800 degrees C. A significant decrease in total
   impedance (resistance) was observed upon exposure to CO2 (ppm level) in
   synthetic air using AC impedance spectroscopy. Fe-BCN showed a fast
   response (t90 similar to 4 min) when 1500 ppm CO2 was introduced. The
   sensor response was found to be linear over the investigated range in
   the log I vs. log pCO(2). Fe-substitution in BaCa0.33Nb0.67O3 (BCN) is
   critical for the observed CO2 sensor properties since BCN exhibited a
   poor response under the identical sensor measurement conditions. The CO2
   sensor mechanism was established using mass spectrometry (MS) in
   combination with DC measurements. The long-term sensor performance was
   studied for Fe-BCN and re-assured high sensitivity, stability and

Abstract = {{As one of the most energetically demanding daily activities, locomotion
   has attracted substantial investigative attention. Although legged
   locomotion has been well described, it is currently not well understood.
   Looking at energy accounting might be a good pathway with which to solve
   this problem. One relatively simple way of analyzing energy management
   is to look directly at the flow of mechanical energy into and out of the
   system, in terms of costs and losses (with some attention to the
   mechanisms responsible for this flow). In this commentary we argue that
   a key source of energetic loss has largely been neglected: the
   redirection of body motion from downward to upward at each step. We
   discuss the role of this loss and the compensating energetic costs,
   identifying some of the general features of the trade-offs that
   determine gait optimization strategies. We find that even at a
   conceptual level, a focus on the main mechanism of loss and the
   strategies available to the organism to effectively compensate for
   losses can yield substantial insight into observations as diverse as the
   functional limits of a playground swing through to the strikingly
   different effect of reduced gravity on human walking and running. Such
   insight changes the interpretation of fundamental features of leg
   function, such as push-off timing and the role of elastic deflection
   during stance.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Alternative splicing and variable post-translational
   modifications result in proteoglycan 4 (PRG4) proteins with historically
   reported apparent molecular weights (Ma) ranging from 150 to 400 kDa.
   The objectives of this study were to (1) identify and determine the
   weight averaged molecular weights (M-W's) of PRG4 proteins purified from
   medium with transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) conditioned
   by mature bovine articular cartilage explants and (2) to examine the
   effect of reduction and alkylation (RA) on PRG4.
   Methods: Non-reduced (NR) and RA preparations of PRG4 were separated
   using high performance liquid chromatography-size-exclusion
   chromatography with an in-line multi-angle laser light scattering
   (MALLS) detector, which was used for absolute determination of PRG4 M-W.
   Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE),
   immunoblotting, and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis were used
   to confirm the identity of separated proteins.
   Results: Three putative PRG4 monomers, one with previously
   uncharacterized M-W, were identified in NR and RA PRG4 preparations of
   239 (223,255), 379 (369,389), and 467 (433,501) kDa. Additionally
   similar to 1 MDa putative PRG4 dimer was identified. Release of a
   similar to 90 kDa PRG4 fragment was also observed on SDS-PAGE after RA.
   Western Blotting with anti-PRG4 antibodies detected immunoreactive bands
   with Ma similar to M-W for all species and excised bands were confirmed
   to be PRG4 by MS/MS.
   Conclusions: A variety of monomeric PRG4 proteins and a disulfide-bonded
   dimer/multimer are secreted by chondrocytes in bovine cartilage
   explants. The observed decrease in Mw's of monomeric PRG4 species upon
   RA may be due to the release of post-translationally cleaved fragments.
   Further study of these species will provide insight into the PRG4
   molecular structure and function relationship. (C) 2012 Osteoarthritis

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Chondrocyte stresses and strains in articular cartilage are
   known to modulate tissue mechanobiology. Cell deformation behavior in
   cartilage under mechanical loading is not known at the earliest stages
   of osteoarthritis. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the
   effect of mechanical loading on volume and morphology of chondrocytes in
   the superficial tissue of osteoarthritic cartilage obtained from
   anterior cruciate ligament transected (ACLT) rabbit knee joints, 4 weeks
   after intervention.
   Methods: A unique custom-made microscopy indentation system with
   dual-photon microscope was used to apply controlled 2 MPa
   force-relaxation loading on patellar cartilage surfaces. Volume and
   morphology of chondrocytes were analyzed before and after loading. Also
   global and local tissue strains were calculated. Collagen content,
   collagen orientation and proteoglycan content were quantified with
   Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy, polarized light microscopy
   and digital densitometry, respectively.
   Results: Following the mechanical loading, the volume of chondrocytes in
   the superficial tissue increased significantly in ACLT cartilage by 24\%
   (95\% confidence interval (CI) 17.2-31.5, P < 0.001), while it reduced
   significantly in contralateral group tissue by -5.3\% (95\% CI -8.1 to
   -2.5, P = 0.003). Collagen content in ACLT and contralateral cartilage
   were similar. PG content was reduced and collagen orientation angle was
   increased in the superficial tissue of ACLT cartilage compared to the
   contralateral cartilage.
   Conclusions: We found the novel result that chondrocyte deformation
   behavior in the superficial tissue of rabbit articular cartilage is
   altered already at 4 weeks after ACLT, likely because of changes in
   collagen fibril orientation and a reduction in PG content. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The robust parameter design of industrial processes and products on the
   basis of the concept of building quality into a design has attracted
   much attention from researchers and practitioners for many years, and
   several methods have been studied in the research community. Dual
   response surface methodology is one of the most commonly used approaches
   for simultaneously optimizing the mean and the variance of response in
   quality engineering. Nevertheless, when the relationship between
   influential input factors and output quality characteristics of a
   process is very complex (e.g. highly nonlinear and noisy), traditional
   approaches have their limitations. In this article, we introduced
   support vector regression, kriging model, and radial basis function,
   which are commonly used in computer experiments, into robust parameter
   design, and especially introduced a new strategy that builds the dual
   response surface using the ensemble of surrogates, which can provide a
   more robust approximation model. We demonstrated the advantages of
   kriging, support vector regression, radial basis function, and the
   ensemble of surrogates by reinvestigating the dual response approach on
   the basis of parametric, nonparametric, and semiparametric approaches,
   and a simulation experiment is studied. The results show that our
   presented models can achieve more desirable results than parametric,
   nonparametric, and semiparametric approaches in terms of fitting and
   predictive accuracy, and the optimal operating conditions recommended by
   our presented models are similar to those recommended in literature,
   which indicates the validation of our presented models. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{Large scale penetration of renewable energies such as wind and solar
   into the electric grid is complicated by their intermittency. Energy
   storage systems can mitigate these fluctuations by storing off-peak
   energy for use at peak-demand times. Compressed air energy storage
   (CAES) is one of the most promising storage technologies due to the
   large amount of energy that can be stored at an economical cost. We
   evaluate the feasibility of improving the economics of CAES by
   distributing compressors near heat loads to enable recovery of the heat
   of compression to supply low-grade heating needs such as district
   heating. Distributed CAES (DCAES) is more efficient; however, it has
   higher capital costs due to the compressed air pipeline required between
   distributed compressors and the storage site. We evaluate the project
   economics of DCAES in a hypothetical scenario with a variable electric
   and heat load. The size and dispatch of a generation fleet composed of a
   wind farm, CAES or DCAES plant and conventional gas turbines are
   optimized to satisfy the annual electricity load at an hourly resolution
   at the lowest total cost. We find that the total cost of supplying heat
   and electric loads is less expensive with DCAES given a 50 km pipeline
   when fuel prices exceed \$7.6/GJ. The cross-over fuel price depends on
   the distance as it drives the capital cost of the pipeline. The minimum
   effective fuel price required for economic superiority of the DCAES
   system is \$7.0/GJ and \$8.3/GJ at pipeline lengths of 25 and 100 km,
   respectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The use of Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) tracking systems for construction site
   applications has attracted the attention of researchers in recent years.
   However, to enable an effective application, it is important to
   establish the accuracy of its location estimation and its performance
   under sub-optimal conditions of construction sites. Expanding on
   previous research, this research studied the performance of an UWB
   tracking system in static mode under conditions that can commonly occur
   on construction sites, namely; the presence of metal objects that
   reflect UWB signals; best signals being blocked by other objects;
   tracking metal objects; removing the timing cables; tracking multiple
   tags simultaneously, and decreased number of receivers. A series of
   experiments were conducted in which the impact of each condition was
   simulated by changing a variable. The accuracy and the relative error of
   location estimations for each experiment were calculated. With one
   exception, an accuracy of less than a meter was achieved in all the
   experiments. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT)
   has recently been introduced as a clinical research tool for in vivo
   assessment of bone quality. The utility of this technology to address
   important skeletal health questions requires translation to standardized
   multicenter data pools. Our goal was to evaluate the feasibility of
   pooling data in multicenter HR-pQCT imaging trials. Reproducibility
   imaging experiments were performed using structure and
   composition-realistic phantoms constructed from cadaveric radii.
   Single-center precision was determined by repeat scanning over
   short-term (<72hours), intermediate-term (35 months), and long-term
   intervals (28 months). Multicenter precision was determined by imaging
   the phantoms at nine different HR-pQCT centers. Least significant change
   (LSC) and root mean squared coefficient of variation (RMSCV) for each
   interval and across centers was calculated for bone density, geometry,
   microstructure, and biomechanical parameters. Single-center short-term
   RMSCVs were <1\% for all parameters except cortical thickness (Ct.Th)
   (1.1\%), spatial variability in cortical thickness (Ct.Th.SD) (2.6\%),
   standard deviation of trabecular separation (Tb.Sp.SD) (1.8\%), and
   porosity measures (6\% to 8\%). Intermediate-term RMSCVs were generally
   not statistically different from short-term values. Long-term
   variability was significantly greater for all density measures (0.7\% to
   2.0\%; p<0.05 versus short-term) and several structure measures:
   cortical thickness (Ct.Th) (3.4\%; p<0.01 versus short-term), cortical
   porosity (Ct.Po) (15.4\%; p<0.01 versus short-term), and trabecular
   thickness (Tb.Th) (2.2\%; p<0.01 versus short-term). Multicenter RMSCVs
   were also significantly higher than short-term values: 2\% to 4\% for
   density and microfinite element analysis (mu FE) measures (p<0.0001),
   2.6\% to 5.3\% for morphometric measures (p<0.001), whereas Ct.Po was
   16.2\% (p<0.001). In the absence of subject motion, multicenter
   precision errors for HR-pQCT parameters were generally less than 5\%.
   Phantom-based multicenter precision was comparable to previously
   reported in in vivo single-center precision errors, although this was
   approximately two to five times worse than ex vivo short-term precision.
   The data generated from this study will contribute to the future design
   and validation of standardized procedures that are broadly translatable
   to multicenter study designs. (c) 2013 American Society for Bone and

Volume = {{91}},

Abstract = {{Aquathermolysis of bitumen occurs when it is thermally cracked in the
   presence of water. Current in situ technologies for bitumen production,
   such as Cyclic Steam Stimulation and Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage,
   inject high pressure, high temperature steam in the reservoir to heat
   the bitumen which in turn lowers its viscosity enabling flow to a
   production well. Thus, the major physical effect of steam is the heating
   of bitumen which mobilises it. Beyond physical interactions, chemical
   effects also result: steam heating produces acid gases, such as carbon
   oxides, sulphur dioxide and hydrogen sulphide along with small amounts
   of hydrogen and methane. For steam-based in situ bitumen recovery
   processes, nearly all analyses, including simple drainage theories and
   thermal reservoir simulations, focus solely on the physical processes:
   heat transfer, fluid flow and thermodynamic equilibrium. However, steam
   chambers are also underground reactors: bitumen aquathermolysis occurs
   due to high temperatures and water saturation. Here, we describe a new
   in situ aquathermolysis reaction scheme for Athabasca bitumen to predict
   hydrogen, methane, carbon oxides, hydrogen sulphide and other heavy
   molecular weight hydrocarbons. Reaction parameters were fitted against
   one experimental data set and validated against other independent
   experimental data sets, both from the literature. Our results indicate
   that, to more accurately predict gas compositions and rates, the effects
   of aquathermolysis should be taken into account in reservoir modelling.

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Typical neural-adaptive control approaches update neural-network weights
   as though they were adaptive parameters in a continuous-time adaptive
   control. However, requiring fast digital rates usually restricts the
   size of the neural network. In this paper we analyze a delta-rule update
   for the weights, applied at a relatively slow digital rate. We show that
   digital weight update causes the neural network to estimate a
   discrete-time model of the system, assuming that state feedback is still
   applied in continuous time. A Lyapunov analysis shows uniformly
   ultimately bounded signals. Furthermore, slowing the update frequency
   and using the extra computational time to increase the size/accuracy of
   the neural network results in better performance. Experimental results
   achieving link tracking of a two-link flexible-joint robot verify the

Title = {{Comparison of the Canadian and US tornado detection and warning systems}},
Journal = {{NATURAL HAZARDS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{117-137}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Tornadoes are one of the most powerful and destructive weather events.
   The frequency of tornado occurrence is highest in North America,
   especially in the US Canada is second only to the US, and approximately,
   80 occurrences are reported annually. Communities are impacted only when
   and if a tornado touches down on the ground. Early recognition of
   tornadoes and proper communication of warnings in the pre-touchdown
   phase helps the public to be ready and respond appropriately and
   effectively. Given that tornadoes are hard to predict and the warnings
   give only a very brief window of opportunity to prepare for evacuation
   to a secure underground or other location, each activity in the
   detection and warning phases is critically important. This study is
   focused on conducting a detailed comparison of the tornado detection and
   warning systems in the US and Canada. The sequences of activities and
   their interrelationships in the tornado detection and warning systems of
   each country are identified and developed as networks. A detection and
   warning network for Canada is developed, using Calgary as a case study,
   whereas a separate network is developed for the US, showing how local
   residents receive tornado warnings initiated by a local weather forecast
   office. Moreover, collaborating partners are identified, and their
   involvement at each level of the information flow is recognized. The two
   networks are compared and critically analyzed, focusing on the key
   issues, such as prediction/detection capabilities, warning
   decision-making, warning dissemination methods, and the spotters' role.
   This qualitative comparison supports the recognition of key areas that
   need to be considered in improving the tornado detection and warning
   system in Canada.}},

Abstract = {{The solubility of carbon dioxide (CO2) in binary mixtures of ethanol and
   n-decane has been measured using an in-house developed
   pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) apparatus at pressures up to 6 MPa and
   two different temperatures (303.2 and 323.2 K). Three different binary
   mixtures of ethanol and n-decane were prepared, and the densities of the
   prepared mixtures were measured over the studied pressure and
   temperature ranges. The experimental data of CO2 solubility in the
   prepared mixtures and their saturated liquid densities were then
   reported at each temperature and pressure. The solubility data indicated
   that the gas solubility reduced as the ethanol mole fraction in the
   liquid mixture increased. The dissolution of CO2 in the liquid mixtures
   resulted in the increase in the saturated liquid densities. The impact
   of gas dissolution on the saturated liquid densities was more pronounced
   at the lower temperature and lower ethanol compositions. The
   experimental solubility and density data were compared with the results
   of two cubic equations of state (EOSs), Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) and
   Peng-Robinson (PR). The modeling results demonstrated that both EOSs
   could predict the solubility data well, while the saturated liquid
   densities calculated with the PR EOS were much better than those
   predicted with the SRK EOS. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{For a discrete-part manufacturing process, adjustment is necessary to

   The objective is to derive a solution for the case that the cost for
   different responses can be different. Based on the state process-control
   model, expressions of optimal adjustment scheme are derived by the
   dynamic programming and congruent transformation of quality loss matrix.
   This scheme belongs to a deadband form and calls for an adjustment only
   when the norm of the linear transformation of perceived process mean
   vector is at the outside of the deadband. A simulation study is
   conducted to compare the scheme proposed in this paper with two other

Abstract = {{Measurement of gas diffusivity in reservoir fluids is of great interest
   for a number of applications, and among different methods for the
   measurement, the Pressure Decay method has received special attention
   due to its simplicity. In this technique, a non-volatile quiescent oil
   column is brought in contact with a diffusing single component gas from
   the top and the rate of change of gas pressure in the gas cap is
   recorded. The interpretation of outcomes is based on solution of a
   forward problem, which sometimes invokes a complicated boundary
   condition. In this work, an analytical solution is presented for the
   most general form of the boundary condition which models the interface.
   It takes into account all mass transfer key parameters including gas
   solubility, a diffusion coefficient and a possible interfacial
   resistance. The effect of resistance against mass diffusion at the
   interface is usually neglected in modeling. Through this solution, the
   role of interface resistance is better explained and one can realize how
   the resistance exactly affects the diffusion process. A detailed
   sensitivity analysis of each parameter is conducted and specifically in
   the case of interface resistance, it is illustrated that a numerical
   value can be reported for the interfacial resistance while it does not
   affect or hinder the diffusion process physically. This could
   unnecessarily increase the degree of freedom of the backward problem,
   and may lead to misleading parameter estimation results (despite a good
   match of the measurements). Using our new interface boundary condition
   reveals that some of the previous works on the modeling of interface
   resistance are subject to underestimation of the rate of gas dissolution
   which may lead to erroneous estimation of parameters. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The prediction of heavy oil phase behavior, particularly with solvents,
   is sensitive to the characterization of the middle and heavy boiling
   point components of the oil. These components are typically
   characterized based on an extrapolation of distillation data. One method
   to test the extrapolated characterization is to model the vapor
   pressures of these fractions or residues containing these fractions.
   Unfortunately, the vapor pressures are too low to be reliably measured
   with conventional techniques. A new high vacuum static apparatus was
   designed and constructed for the measurement of vapor pressure of heavy
   oil and bitumen samples. The apparatus is capable of measuring pressures
   from 100 down to 0.1 Pa and temperatures in the range of 293.15-473.15
   K. New procedures were developed to degas samples and obtain accurate
   vapor pressures at vacuum conditions. The apparatus was tested on
   n-hexadecane and naphthalene at temperatures between 303.15 and 363.15
   K. The measured vapor pressures were, on average, all within 13\% of the
   literature data. The vapor pressures of a Western Canadian bitumen
   sample (WC\_BIT\_B1) and three of its fractions were measured using the
   apparatus. The WC\_BIT\_B1 bitumen was modeled using the Advanced
   Peng-Robinson equation of state using a Gaussian extrapolation of its
   distillation curve for the maltene fraction and a Gamma molecular
   distribution for its asphaltene fraction. The measured vapor pressures
   were all predicted to within 3.5\%.}},

Abstract = {{Disposing solid residue with high liquid content into the environment
   may impact the immediate ecosystem and its surroundings. In bitumen
   recovery process from oil sands, it is environmentally and economically
   desirable to effectively recover as much of the liquid trapped in the
   spent solids as possible, prior to releasing it into the environment. An
   experiment was designed to investigate the effect of capillary force to
   enhance liquid recovery by using a thin, semipermeable layer as the
   membrane. The results indicate that by employing a membrane at the
   outlet, and pressurizing the air above the sand bed, the average liquid
   saturation can be decreased by 50\%; however, the maximum pressure
   applied is restricted by the physical characteristics of the membrane. A
   mathematical model is developed to predict the liquid saturation profile
   along the sand pack during transient and steady-state conditions, and
   results are validated against measured average saturation using two
   different sand types. Results suggest that more liquid can be recovered
   from the spent sand bed by increasing the height of the bed; however,
   the required time to achieve the maximum recovery is increased as well.
   This method can be applied to reduce the liquid content of spent sand
   from any process before it is disposed of, thereby reducing possible
   hazards which may affect the environment.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the mechanical properties of formations has its importance
   in the drilling, production, and management phases of reservoirs. In
   petroleum engineering, measurements through wire-line logs, which run in
   the boreholes after the drilling phase, are of the most common methods
   to estimate mechanical properties of different layers. Elastic rock
   mechanic measurements from logs are dynamic values and need to be
   upscaled and calibrated to fit the corresponding pseudo-static
   measurements that are obtained from cores in the laboratory. As a
   practical approach to having a continuous profile of these static
   parameters and surmount the arduousness that confronts by using core
   samples and laboratory tests, many researchers tried to deploy
   predictive methods and empirical correlations. However, it will be a
   great advantage to have a real-time estimation of these static
   parameters while drilling based on bit and formation rock interaction.
   Artificial neural networks are powerful tools for estimation of complex
   functions subjected to availability of large enough data sets that
   present samples of actual behavior of the function. In this study,
   artificial neural networks were implemented to estimate in situ rock
   mechanical properties, including Unconfined Compressive Strength,
   Young's Modulus of Elasticity, and the ratio of these parameters known
   as Modulus Ratio, by using operational drilling parameters as inputs.
   Required data were gathered from drilling reports, logging operations,
   and core samples from nine wells placed in Ahwaz Oilfield located in
   south-west Iran. The trained networks showed satisfactory low errors in
   the testing process and sketched the capability of artificial neural
   networks in estimation of complex functions. The accuracy of the
   presented model was then compared with the results of calibrated
   regional correlations and modified Warren's equation. These correlations
   are used in the candidate wells to estimate Unconfined Compressive
   Strength and Young's Modulus of Elasticity. It was observed that the new
   artificial neural network approach is a competent and accurate method
   for real-time calculation of static elastic properties of formation
   rocks. The results of this work could be used for drilling optimization,
   reducing stability problems, and lithologic boundary detection while
   drilling.}},

Abstract = {{Solubilities of carbon dioxide in n-octadecane and its binary mixtures
   with n-decane have been reported at 372.8K over the pressure range 1-6
   MPa. The binary mixtures of n-octadecane and n-decane were prepared at
   0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 mole fractions of n-decane. The density and
   viscosity of n-octadecane and its binary mixtures were first measured.
   Then, the phase behaviour measurements were undertaken with a designed
   PVT apparatus to investigate the solubility, gas-expanded liquid density
   and viscosity when the liquid hydrocarbon was saturated with carbon
   dioxide. The solubility data showed that the solubility of carbon
   dioxide in n-decane, n-octadecane, and their binary mixtures rose with
   pressure and reduced as the mixture became heavier. The data indicated
   the dissolution of carbon dioxide in pure species or their binary
   mixtures caused a decline in the viscosity of saturated liquid phase and
   led to an increase in density of gas-expanded liquid. The solubility and
   density measurements were then correlated with Soave-Redlich-Kwong and
   Peng-Robinson equations of state. The volume translation technique and
   the adjustment of binary iteration parameters were applied to fit the
   generated data. The modelling results indicated that the volume
   translation technique should be applied to all components present in the
   mixture for the densities to be accurately predicted. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A convenient method for the incorporation of nickel into an
   aluminosilicate MFI type zeolite, which avoids the impregnation of
   nickel, drying and further calcinations steps, to produce a bifunctional
   catalyst in a cost efficient way, is presented. The one step preparation
   involves the addition of the nickel source in the zeolite preparation
   step and anchoring it during the crystallization process. After
   calcination to remove the organic template, the composite zeolite is ion
   exchanged to produce the acid form, which already has the nickel
   incorporated and no further steps are required. The incorporation of
   high contents of nickel (up to 5 wt\% nominal) induced important
   modifications in the produced materials. As the amount of nickel
   increases, the textural properties are modified and lower micropore area
   and volume and higher mesopore and total volumes are observed. The
   amount of acidic sites decreased and the sites seem to be of the
   Bronsted kind. The nickel seems to be well dispersed or anchored in the
   prepared material and then high temperatures are used to reduce the
   oxidation state of nickel in the material; however, the catalyst with 1
   wt\% nickel incorporated showed good physical-chemical properties and
   was as active as other catalysts for the hydroconversion of toluene. The
   tested catalyst had a good tolerance to sulfur, indicating that part of
   the nickel incorporated is hindered from sulfur poisoning but is active
   for the dissociation of hydrogen during hydrogenation in the presence of
   sulfur. Crown Copyright (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Conventional gravity and magnetic anomaly continuation invokes the
   standard Poisson boundary condition of a zero anomaly at an infinite
   vertical distance from the observation surface. This simple continuation
   is limited, however, where multiple altitude slices of the anomaly field
   have been observed. Increasingly, areas are becoming available which are
   constrained by multiple boundary conditions from surface, airborne, and
   satellite surveys. This paper describes the implementation of
   continuation with multi-altitude boundary conditions in Cartesian and
   spherical coordinates and investigates the advantages and limitations of
   these applications. Continuations by EPS (equivalent point source)
   inversion and the FT (Fourier transform), as well as by SCHA (spherical
   cap harmonic analysis) are considered. These methods were selected
   because they are especially well suited for analyzing multi-altitude
   data over finite patches of the earth such as those covered by the ADMAP
   database. In general, continuations constrained by multi-altitude data
   surfaces are invariably superior to those constrained by a single
   altitude data surface due to anomaly measurement errors and the
   non-uniqueness of continuation. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The GRACE gravity and subglacial terrain data of Wilkes Land are
   consistent with the presence of a mascon produced by giant impact
   perhaps at the end of the Permian. In contrast to the relatively
   extensive ice probing radar coverage, aeromagnetic data coverage is
   limited across the basin. However, Magsat, Orsted, and CHAMP satellite
   magnetic observations reveal the thinned crust of the impact site to be
   associated with the largest satellite altitude crustal magnetic anomaly
   of Antarctica. The underlying region of enhanced magnetization is
   consistent with the GRACE gravity and BEDMAP terrain data and extends
   into south-central Australia in a reconstructed Gondwana. The strongly
   magnetized crust can reflect the impact's thermal enhancement of lower
   crustal viscous remanent magnetization as well as the production of
   positively magnetized melt rocks within the fractured crust. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Particle image velocimetry measurements in close proximity to
   dielectric-barrier discharge plasma actuators are conducted to quantify
   the momentum transfer of the plasma to the surrounding air flow. Based
   on these data a comparative analysis of six existing approaches to
   estimate the induced body force is presented. Integral methods calculate
   an integral value for the actuator force based on the momentum-balance
   equation. Insight into the spatial distribution of the body force is
   provided by differential methods, which are based either on the
   Navier-Stokes equations or on the vorticity equation. It is demonstrated
   that the intensity as well as the domain of the force increase with
   increasing operating power levels. Emphasis is also placed on the issue
   of self-induced drag. It is shown that 30\% of the induced momentum is
   consumed by wall friction. All results are validated with previously
   obtained balance force data and luminosity analysis of identical
   actuators.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a hardware implementation of a digital watermarking
   system that can insert invisible, semifragile watermark information into
   compressed video streams in real time. The watermark embedding is
   processed in the discrete cosine transform domain. To achieve high
   performance, the proposed system architecture employs pipeline structure
   and uses parallelism. Hardware implementation using field programmable
   gate array has been done, and an experiment was carried out using a
   custom versatile breadboard for overall performance evaluation.
   Experimental results show that a hardware-based video authentication
   system using this watermarking technique features minimum video quality
   degradation and can withstand certain potential attacks, i.e., cover-up
   attacks, cropping, and segment removal on video sequences. Furthermore,
   the proposed hardware-based watermarking system features low power
   consumption, low cost implementation, high processing speed, and
   reliability.}},

Abstract = {{Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) technology is playing a key role
   in the design of the new generation of smartphones. Thanks to their
   reduced size, reduced power consumption, MEMS sensors can be embedded in
   above mobile devices for increasing their functionalities. However, MEMS
   cannot allow accurate autonomous location without external updates, e.
   g., from GPS signals, since their signals are degraded by various
   errors. When these sensors are fixed on the user's foot, the stance
   phases of the foot can easily be determined and periodic Zero velocity
   UPdaTes (ZUPTs) are performed to bound the position error. When the
   sensor is in the hand, the situation becomes much more complex. First of
   all, the hand motion can be decoupled from the general motion of the
   user. Second, the characteristics of the inertial signals can differ
   depending on the carrying modes. Therefore, algorithms for
   characterizing the gait cycle of a pedestrian using a handheld device
   have been developed. A classifier able to detect motion modes typical
   for mobile phone users has been designed and implemented. According to
   the detected motion mode, adaptive step detection algorithms are
   applied. Success of the step detection process is found to be higher
   than 97\% in all motion modes.}},

   strain) in two regions of the rabbit knee joint (femoral condyles and
   patellae). Local matrix strains and cell compressive strains increased
   with increasing loads. At low loads the extracellular matrix (ECM)
   strains in the superficial zone were greater than the applied tissue
   strains, while at extreme loads, the local ECM strains were smaller than
   the applied strains. Cell compressive strains were always smaller than
   the applied tissue strains and, in our intact, in situ preparation, were
   substantially smaller than those previously found in hemi-cylindrical
   explants. This resulted in markedly different steady-state cell volume
   changes in the current study compared to those working with cartilage
   explants. Additionally, cells from different regions in the knee
   exhibited striking differences in deformation behavior under load. The
   current results suggest: (i) that the local extracellular and
   pericellular matrix environment is intimately linked to chondrocyte
   mechanobiology, protecting chondrocytes from potentially damaging
   strains at high tissue loads; and (ii) that cell mechanics are a
   function of applied load and local cartilage tissue structure. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{In this study, single-phase gas-flow simulation that considers slippage
   effects through a network of slots and microfractures is presented. The
   statistical parameters for network construction were extracted from
   petrographic work in tight porous media of the Nikanassin Group in the
   Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB). Furthermore, correlations
   between Klinkenberg slippage effect and absolute permeability have been
   developed as well as a new unified flow model in which Knudsen number
   acts implicitly as a flow-regime indicator. A detailed understanding of
   fluid flow at microscale levels in tight porous media is essential to
   establish and develop techniques for economic flow rate and recovery.
   Choosing an appropriate equation for flow through a single element of
   the network is crucial; this equation must include geometry and other
   structural features that affect the flow as well as all variation of
   fluid properties with pressure. Disregarding these details in a single
   element of porous media can easily lead to flow misinterpretation at the
   macroscopic scale. Because of the wide flow-path-size distribution in
   tight porous media, a variety of flow regimes can exist in the
   equivalent network. Two distinct flow regimes, viscous flow and free
   molecular flow, are in either side of this flow-regime spectrum. Because
   the nature of these two types of flow is categorically different,
   finding/adjusting a unified flow model is problematic. The complication
   stems from the fact that the viscosity concept misses its meaning as the
   flow regime changes from viscous to free molecular flow in which a
   diffusion-like mechanism dominates. For each specified flow regime, the
   appropriate equations for different geometries are studied. In addition,
   different unified flow models available in the literature are critically
   investigated. Simulation of gas flow through the constructed network at
   different mean flow pressures leads to investigating the functionality
   of the Klinkenberg factor with permeability of the porous media and
   pore-level structure.}},

   method maintains conservation property associated with the Navier-Stokes

   corresponding finite volume method is first introduced to obtain optimal
   error estimates for velocity and pressure. This error analysis shows
   that the present stabilized finite volume method provides an approximate
   solution with the same convergence rate as that provided by the
   stabilized linear finite element method for the Navier-Stokes equations
   under the same regularity assumption on the exact solution and a
   slightly additional regularity on the source term. The stability and
   convergence results of the proposed method are also demonstrated by the

Abstract = {{Background: Using the reservoir-wave approach, we studied wave
   propagation, reflection, and re-reflection in the canine aorta with
   administrations of sodium nitroprusside (NP) and methoxamine (Mtx).
   Methods: In 8 anaesthetized dogs, excess pressures were calculated from
   pressure and flow measurements at 4 locations along the aorta; wave
   intensity analysis was employed to identify wavefronts and the type of
   waves.
   Results: NP (intravenous; 14 mu g/min) decreased mean aortic pressure
   from 80 +/- 3 mm Hg to 48 +/- 1 mm Hg; Mtx (intravenous; 10 mu g/mm)
   increased mean pressure from 80 +/- 3 mm Hg to 104 +/- 4 mm Hg. NP
   increased negative reflection near the kidneys (reflection coefficient:
   -0.33 vs -0.18; P < 0.01) and produced new negatively reflecting sites
   just beyond the arch and in the proximal femoral arteries, consistent
   with a vasodilating effects of nitrates on conducting arteries. Mtx
   negated negative reflection from near the kidneys (-0.02 vs -0.17; P <
   0.01) and increased positive femoral reflection (0.38 vs 0.26; P <
   0.01). The large reflected compression wave was re-reflected from the
   closed aortic valve to produce a prominent increase in middiastolic
   pressure in the distal aorta.
   Conclusions: The reservoir-wave approach explains decreasing diastolic
   pressure without positing waves that travel at near-infinite velocities
   and reveals the pressure changes that are uniquely due to wave motion.}},

Abstract = {{Current precise point positioning (PPP) techniques are mainly based on
   GPS which has been extensively investigated. With the increase of
   available GLONASS satellites during its revitalization, GLONASS
   observations were increasingly integrated into GPS-based PPP. Now that
   GLONASS has reached its full constellation, there will be a wide
   interest in PPP systems based on only GLONASS since it provides a PPP
   implementation independent of GPS. An investigation of GLONASS-based PPP
   will also help the development of GPS and GLONASS combined PPP
   techniques for improved precision and reliability. This paper presents
   an observation model for GLONASS-based PPP in which the GLONASS hardware
   delay biases are addressed. In view of frequently changed frequency
   channel number (FCN) for GLONASs satellites, an algorithm has been
   developed to compute the FCN for GLONASS satellites using code and phase
   observations, which avoids the need to provide the GLONASS frequency
   channel information during data processing. The observation residuals
   from GLONASS-based PPP are analyzed and compared to those from GPS-based
   PPP. The performance of GLONASS-based PPP is assessed using data from 15
   globally distributed stations. (C) 2012 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier

   images were acquired from 6 cadaveric specimens implanted with standard

   alignments. In comparison with standard CT measures, the ISO-C-based
   measures had overall accuracies (determined as root mean square error)
   of 0.8 degrees and 1.3 degrees and corresponding SDs of 1.3 degrees and
   1.4 degrees for the femoral and tibial components, respectively. With
   ISO-C imaging, it is possible to measure rotational alignment in knee

Title = {{The Knee Loading Apparatus: Axial, Anterior, and Compressive Loading
   With Magnetic Resonance Imaging}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{When magnetic resonance (MR) images are collected while applying a load
   to the knee joint, additional information about the joint response to
   loading can be acquired such as cartilage deformation, whole joint and
   ligament stiffness, or physiological estimates of weight-bearing joint
   positions. To allow load application and controlled lower limb movement
   in supine MR imaging, the knee loading apparatus (KLA) was designed to
   apply safe and physiologically relevant controlled loads to the knee
   joint, position the knee through a range of flexion angles, and operate
   successfully in a magnetic environment. The KLA is composed of three
   main components: a remotely operated custom hydraulic loading system, a
   logic system that interfaces with the user, and modular non
   ferromagnetic positioning frames. Three positioning frames are presented
   for application to anterior tibial loading, tibiofemoral compression,
   and patellofemoral compression at multiple knee flexion angles. This
   system design makes improvements over current devices. Safe remotely
   applied loads (hydraulic loading system) can be applied by either
   subject or tester and in multiple locations simultaneously.
   Additionally, loads can be altered at any time in a continuous manner
   without electrical interference. Transportability was improved due to a
   smaller footprint. The KLA has the flexibility to attach any positioning
   frame with many possible loading scenarios without changing the loading
   mechanism or logic systems, and allows force values over time to be
   output rather than estimated. An evaluation of the load repeatability
   (within 7\% of applied load) and accuracy (0.5-14.9\%) demonstrates the
   feasibility of this design for investigations into in vivo knee joint
   responses to loading. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4023152]}},

Abstract = {{The study of deciduous phenology over boreal forest is important for
   understanding forest ecology and better management. In this paper, our
   objective was to determine the phenological stages of deciduous leaf out
   (DLO) over the deciduous-dominant {[}i.e. trembling aspen (Populus
   tremuloides)] stands in the Canadian Province of Alberta.
   During the period 2006-2008, we used Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based 8-day surface temperature (T-S) images
   to calculate accumulated growing degree days (AGDD: a favourable
   temperature regime for plant growth). The temporal dynamics of AGDD in
   conjunction with in situ DLO observations were then analysed in
   determining the optimal threshold for DLO in 2006 (i.e. 80 degree days).
   The implementation of the above-mentioned optimal threshold revealed
   reasonable agreements (i.e. on an average 91.9\% of the DLO cases within
   +/- 2 periods or +/- 16 days of deviations during 2007-2008) in
   comparison to the in situ observed data. The developments could be
   useful in various forestry-related applications, e.g. plant growth and
   its ability of exchanging atmospheric carbon dioxide, forest
   ecohydrology, risk of insect infestation, forest fire and impact of
   climate change, among others.}},

Title = {{New gas material balance to quantify biogenic gas generation rates from

Journal = {{FUEL}},

Abstract = {{With increased demand for fossil fuels of more than 50\% in the next 25
   years, several methods of either enhancing oil and gas production from
   existing fields or finding new fields and tackling unconventional
   sources, such as shale gas reservoirs, are currently underway.
   Microbially-generated methane gas is a significant portion of commercial
   gas production around the world. At least 20\% of the world's methane
   originates from methanogens that reside within organic-matter-rich
   shales and coals. The metabolic processes and chemical reactions carried
   out by microorganisms in shale gas reservoirs are currently unknown
   making it difficult to predict or enhance gas generation rates within a
   given reservoir. Field production data reveal that gas production from
   these reservoirs declines initially and then stabilizes after a
   specified time. The stabilized rate is controlled by contributions from
   biogenic gas generation, desorption of gas from kerogen, and diffusion
   and transport of gas through nanometer to potentially even micron scale
   pore systems. It still remains unclear which one of microbial gas
   generation or gas transport is the key limitation on production of
   biogenic gas from shale gas reservoirs. This paper presents a modified
   gas material balance on production data for shale gas wells to account
   for biogenic gas generation. Although the gas material balance approach
   is well established, it has not been used to estimate biogenic gas
   generation rates. By using actual gas production data from a field where
   biogenic gas production is known to be the main source of gas
   generation, the amount of biogenic gas that was produced within the
   reservoir during the resource lifetime of the well could be determined.
   The results of the theory presented here were compared to gas production
   data from Nexen's Bigstick Field and Husky's Abbey Field. The results
   reveal that a significant fraction, up to about one-third, of gas
   production is sourced from constant biogenic gas generation. The
   implication is that biogenic shale gas productivity can be potentially
   enhanced if microbes are stimulated. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The effect of sawdust on the rate of limestone carbonation/calcination
   reactions was studied in a thermogravimetric analyzer applying a grain

   observed under a scanning electron microscope (SEM), while the
   quantitative influence of calcination conditions was examined by BET
   surface areas. The presence of sawdust during calcination caused a
   significant increase in the initial rate of carbonation, which has been
   attributed to the enhancement of CaO surface area. The presence of H-2
   which is emitted from sawdust pyrolysis was assumed to be responsible
   for reduction of limestone sintering. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   resulting in the steel corrosion experiencing a mechanistic alteration.
   The effects of oxygen and temperature on the steel corrosion were

Title = {{Suture marker lesion detection in the colon by self-stabilizing and
   unmodified capsule endoscopes: pilot study in acute canine models}},
Journal = {{GASTROINTESTINAL ENDOSCOPY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{77}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{272-279}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background: Capsule endoscopy is a noninvasive method for examining the
   small intestine. Recently, this method has been used to visualize the
   colon. However, the capsule often tumbles in the wider colon lumen,
   resulting in potentially missed pathology. In addition, the capsule does
   not have the ability to distend collapsed segments of the organ.
   Self-stabilizing capsule endoscopy is a new method of visualizing the
   colon without tumbling and with the ability to passively distend colon
   walls.
   Objective: To quantitatively compare the detection rate of intraluminal
   suture marker lesions for colonoscopy by using a custom-modified,
   self-stabilizing capsule endoscope (SCE); an unmodified capsule
   endoscope (CE) of the same brand; and a standard colonoscope.
   Design: Four mongrel dogs underwent laparotomy and the implantation of 5
   to 8 suture markers to approximate colon lesions. Each dog had both
   capsule endoscopy and self-stabilizing capsule endoscopy, administered
   consecutively in random order. In each case, the capsule was inserted
   endoscopically into the proximal lumen of the colon followed by
   pharmacologically induced colon peristalsis to propel it distally
   through the colon. Blinded standard colonoscopy was performed by an
   experienced gastroenterologist after the capsule endoscopies.
   Setting: Experimental study in a live canine model.
   Subjects: Four dogs.
   Intervention: Laparotomy, capsule endoscopy, colonoscopy.
   Main Outcome Measurements: Comparison of the marker detection rate of
   the SCE to that of the unmodified MiroCam CE and a colonoscope.
   Results: The average percentages of the marker detection rate for
   unmodified capsule endoscopy, self-stabilizing capsule endoscopy, and
   colonoscopy, respectively, were 31.1\%, 86\%, and 100\% (P < .01), with
   both self-stabilizing capsule endoscopy and colonoscopy performing
   significantly better than the unmodified capsule endoscopy. Limitations:
   Acute canine model, suture markings poorly representative of epithelial
   polyps, limited number of animals.
   Conclusion: The proposed self-stabilizing capsule endoscope delivered a
   significant improvement in detection rates of colon suture markings when
   compared with the unmodified capsule endoscope. (Gastrointest Endosc

Abstract = {{Over the last several decades, there has been increased attention on the
   heavy metal contamination associated with highways because of the
   associated health hazards and risks. Here, the results are reported of
   an analysis of the content of metals in roadside dust samples of
   selected major highways in the Greater Toronto Area of Ontario, Canada.
   The metals analysed are lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni),
   chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), calcium (Ca), potassium (K),
   magnesium (Mg) and iron (Fe). In the samples collected, the recorded
   mean concentrations (in parts per million) are as follows: Cd (0.51), Cu
   (162), Fe (40,052), Cr (197.9), K (9647.6), Mg (577.4), Ca (102,349), Zn
   (200.3), Mn (1202.2), Pb (182.8) and Ni (58.8). The mean concentrations
   for the analysed samples in the study area are almost all higher than
   the average natural background values for the corresponding metals. The
   geo-accumulation index of these metals in the roadside dust under study
   indicates that they are not contaminated with Cr, Mn and Ca; moderately
   contaminate with Cd and K; strongly contaminated with Fe and Mg;
   strongly to extremely contaminated with Ni and Pb; and extremely
   contaminated with Cu and Zn. The pollution load index (PLI) is used to
   relate pollution to highway conditions, and the results show that PLI
   values are slightly low at different samples collected from Highways 401
   and 404 and high in many samples collected from Highway 400 and the Don
   Valley Parkway. Highway 400 exhibits the highest PLI values.}},

   are calculated using the Maxwell-Garnetts (MG) and Brinkman models,

Abstract = {{This work investigates the access point (AP) selection problem in
   Variable channel-width WLANs (V-WLANs) using an evolutionary
   game-theoretic approach. A practical utility function is designed for
   each station in which the QoS requirement and energy consumption are
   considered. An Evolutionary Stable Strategy (ESS) of the game
   corresponds to the desired AP selection outcome, which remains stable
   even if the stations occasionally select inappropriate APs. A
   distributed learning algorithm based on replicator dynamics is developed
   to obtain the ESS with only local information. Simulation results verify

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{Background. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of motor
   impairment after stroke strongly depends on patient effort and capacity
   to make a movement. Hence fMRI has had limited use in clinical
   management. Alternatively, resting-state fMRI (ie, with no task) can
   elucidate the brain's functional connections by determining temporal
   synchrony between brain regions. Objective. The authors examined whether
   resting-state fMRI can elucidate the disruption of functional
   connections within hours of ischemic stroke as well as during recovery.
   Methods. A total of 51 ischemic stroke patients-31 with mild-to-moderate
   hand deficits (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale {[}NIHSS]
   motor score ayen1) and 20 with NIHSS score of 0-underwent resting-state
   fMRI at < 24 hours, 7 days, and 90 days poststroke; 15 age-matched
   healthy individuals participated in 1 session. Using the resting-state
   fMRI signal from the ipsilesional motor cortex, the strength of
   functional connections with the contralesional motor cortex was
   computed. Whole-brain maps of the resting-state motor network were also
   generated and compared between groups and sessions. Results. Within
   hours poststroke, patients with motor deficits exhibited significantly
   lower connectivity than controls (P = .02) and patients with no motor
   impairment (P = .03). Connectivity was reestablished after 7 days in
   recovered (ie, NIHSS score = 0) participants. After 90 days, recovered
   patients exhibited normal motor connectivity; however, reduced
   connectivity with subcortical regions associated with effort and
   cognitive processing remained. Conclusion. Resting-state fMRI within
   hours of ischemic stroke can demonstrate the impact of stroke on
   functional connections throughout the brain. This tool has the potential
   to help select appropriate stroke therapies in an acute imaging setting
   and to monitor the efficacy of rehabilitation.}},

Abstract = {{Lidar has been established over the past few years as a mainstream tool
   for the acquisition of three dimensional point data. Besides the
   conventional mapping missions, lidar has proven to be very useful for a
   wide spectrum of applications such as forestry, urban planning,
   structural deformation analysis, and reverse engineering. In the context
   of a nationwide dataset, it is safe to assume that multiple laser
   scanners are under different conditions to collect the data. Current
   registration and segmentation algorithms assume homogeneity in the local
   point density and accuracy which is an invalid assumption that cannot be
   tolerated. As a consequence of the wide range of lidar sensors currently
   available, it is becoming crucial to develop algorithms for the
   registration and segmentation of lidar data with significantly varying
   characteristics (i.e., varying point density and accuracy). In this
   paper, a methodology for the optimal registration and segmentation of
   heterogeneous lidar data is presented. An example of integrating
   airborne and terrestrial laser scans is presented and followed by a
   discussion of the pros of the integration process.}},

Abstract = {{Lidar systems have been proven as a cost-effective tool for the
   collection of high density and accurate point cloud over physical
   surfaces. The collected point cloud does not exhibit homogenous point
   distribution due to the characteristics of the scanning system and/or
   the physical properties of the scanned surfaces. In order to effectively
   process the lidar point clouds, local point density variations should be
   quantified and taken into account for the definition of processing
   parameters. In this paper, new approaches are presented for the
   estimation of local point density indices while considering the 3D
   relationship among lidar points, the physical properties of the
   reflecting surfaces, and the noise level in the datasets collected by
   different laser scanners. The impact of considering the estimated local
   point density variations on the quality of lidar data segmentation
   results is then investigated by performing a quality control procedure.
   Quantitative evaluation of segmentation results highlights the efficacy
   of utilizing the estimated local point density indices-for the
   derivation of more accurate segmentation.}},

Abstract = {{The platinum (Pt) particle electrocatalysts were fabricated by a
   surfactant-free, electro-deposition technique in the cyclic voltammetric
   mode for electro-oxidation of ammonia in aqueous solutions. The
   hierarchical Pt nanoparticles with various morphologies, including
   sheet-, flower-, prickly sphere- and cauliflower-like shapes, were
   obtained by controlling the electrodepositing parameters. The amount of
   Pt loading was determined by an inductively coupled plasma method, and
   the electrocatalytic activity of the prepared nano-Pt electrocatalysts
   for the ammonia oxidation was characterized by cyclic voltammetry. The
   results showed that there is a remarkable effect of the surface
   morphology of Pt particles on the electrocatalytic activity. In
   particular, the hierarchical Pt particles have a much higher
   electrocatalytic activity for the ammonia oxidation than the smooth,
   spherical Pt particles. The improved electrocatalytic activity is
   attributed not only to the large electrochemically active surface area
   (ECSA) achieved, but also to the high electrocatalytic activity per unit
   ECSA. Electro-deposition technique provides a promising alternative to
   fabricate high-performance electrocatalysts for oxidation of ammonia in
   aqueous solutions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental phase equilibrium data have been measured for the binary
   and ternary systems containing (carbon dioxide, n-decane, and
   n-tetradecane) at 323.2 K over the pressure range (1 to 6) MPa using a
   designed PVT apparatus. The measurements presented in this paper were
   undertaken to determine liquid phase composition and liquid saturated
   properties (density and viscosity) when a liquid hydrocarbon (n-decane,
   n-tetradecane, and their mixtures) was saturated with carbon dioxide.
   The generated data for compositions and densities were correlated with
   the Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) and Peng-Robinson (PR) equations of state
   (EOS). The adjustment of binary interaction parameters and volume
   translation technique has been employed to correlate the experimental
   compositions and densities. The adjusted binary parameters from the data
   of binary pairs (carbon dioxide + n-decane) and (carbon dioxide +
   n-tetradecane) were used to correlate the generated ternary data. The
   calculated ternary compositions were found to be in good agreement with
   the experimental data using the binary parameters from the data of
   binary pairs for both EOSs. The results for the density of saturated
   liquid phase indicated that the volume translation should be applied to
   all components in the binary and ternary systems to describe accurately
   the saturated liquid densities for mixtures. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The solubilities of carbon dioxide in different alcohols, methanol,

   (303.2 and 323.2) K and pressures up to 6 MPa. The experimental data of

   temperature and pressure. The solubility data shows that the solubility
   of carbon dioxide in alcohol increases with pressure and decreases with
   temperatures in the studied pressure and temperature ranges. The higher
   dissolution of carbon dioxide in alcohols resulted in increase in the
   saturated liquid densities and decrease in saturated liquid viscosities.
   The experimental solubility as well as saturated liquid density data
   were predicted with two cubic equations of state (EOS), Peng-Robinson
   (PR) and Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK). The modeling results demonstrated
   that both equations of state correlated the solubility data well over

Abstract = {{One of the imperative problems in the realm of wireless sensor networks
   is the problem of wireless sensors localization. Despite the fact that
   much research has been conducted in this area, many of the proposed
   approaches produce unsatisfactory results when exposed to the harsh,
   uncertain, noisy conditions of a manufacturing environment. In this
   study, we develop an artificial neural network approach to moderate the
   effect of the miscellaneous noise sources and harsh factory conditions
   on the localization of the wireless sensors. Special attention is given
   to investigate the effect of blockage and ambient conditions on the
   accuracy of mobile node localization. A simulator, simulating the noisy
   and dynamic shop conditions of manufacturing environments, is employed
   to examine the neural network proposed. The neural network performance
   is also validated through some actual experiments in real-world
   environment prone to different sources of noise and signal attenuation.
   The simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness
   and accuracy of the proposed methodology. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Aquaprocessing (AQP) is a novel method that offers higher conversion

   a 2011 published work by Fathi and Pereira on upgrading a paraffinic
   residuum from Arab Light Vacuum Residue (ALVR) by AQP, this work
   investigates a proposed lumped kinetic model for the upgrading of ALVR
   via AQP for the first time. The model is evaluated based on experimental
   results conducted in a continuous upflow open tubular pilot-plant
   reactor under short-space times and under conditions distant from coke
   formation. The proposed model is based on five cascaded lumps generated
   at and below the asphaltenes stability limit: 540 degrees C+ ALVR, VG0
   (455-540 degrees C), distillates (204-455 degrees C), naphtha (IBP-204

Title = {{Dominant Scaling Groups of Polymer Flooding for Enhanced Heavy Oil
   Recovery}},

Abstract = {{Polymer flooding of heavy oils on the laboratory scale shows appreciable
   incremental tertiary oil recovery. In reality, however, this high
   recovery efficiency usually cannot be achieved in the field due mainly
   to extremely unfavorable mobility ratio and reservoir heterogeneity. The
   former promotes viscous fingering while the latter induces channeling;
   hence both of these factors make the displacement process less
   efficient. This paper identifies the dominant scaling groups for polymer
   flooding currently conducted in western Canadian heavy oil reservoirs.
   Twenty-eight dimensionless scaling groups governing the process of
   polymer flooding for enhanced heavy oil recovery were derived using
   inspectional analysis, and a fully tuned numerical model for polymer
   flooding of a heavy oil sample in a two-dimensional sand pack was then
   developed to validate the effectiveness of these scaling groups. A good
   agreement among different cases with the same group values was observed,
   showing the validity of the scaling groups. The effect of each scaling
   group on oil recovery was examined by numerical sensitivity analysis. By
   doing so, nine scaling groups dominating polymer flooding enhanced heavy
   oil recovery were identified. These dominant scaling groups can be used
   to design scaled experiments to predict field-scale oil recovery by
   polymer flooding in heavy oil reservoirs.}},

Abstract = {{The solubilities of carbon dioxide (CO2) in decane, tetradecane and
   their binary mixtures have been measured at a temperature of 373.2 K and
   pressures up to 6 MPa using a rocking mechanism
   pressure-volume-temperature apparatus. The measurements presented in
   this paper were undertaken to determine the solubility and liquid
   saturated properties (density and viscosity) when a liquid hydrocarbon
   (decane, tetradecane and their mixtures) was saturated with CO2. The
   generated data for compositions and densities were correlated with the
   Soave-Redlich-Kwong and Peng-Robinson equations of state (EOSs). The
   binary interaction parameters were adjusted, and the volume translation
   technique was employed to correlate the experimental compositions and
   densities. The generated ternary data were correlated with the adjusted
   binary parameters from the data of binary pairs (CO2 + decane) and (CO2
   + tetradecane). The calculated ternary compositions were found to be in
   good agreement with the experimental data using the binary parameters
   from the data of binary pairs for both EOSs. The results for the density
   of the saturated liquid phase indicated that volume translation should
   be applied to all components in the binary and ternary systems to
   accurately describe the saturated liquid densities for mixtures. (C)

Abstract = {{The relationships between mechanical inputs and resulting biological
   tissue structure, composition, and metabolism are critical to detailing
   the nuances of tissue mechanobiology in both healthy and injured
   tissues. Developing a model system to test the mechanobiology of tissues
   ex-vivo is a complex task, as controlling chemical and mechanical
   boundary layers in-vitro are difficult to replicate. A novel multi-unit
   vibration loading platform for intervertebral discs was designed and
   validated with both independent electronic data and experimental loading
   of 6 bovine intervertebral discs (IVDs) and an equal number of unloaded
   controls. Sustained vibration was applied using closed-loop positional
   control of pushrods within four independent bioreactors with circulating
   phosphate buffered saline. The bioreactors were designed to be modular
   with removable components allowing for easy cleaning and replacement.
   The loading regime was chosen to maximize target mRNA expression as
   reported in previous research. Aggrecan, decorin, and versican mRNA all
   reported statistically significant increases above control levels.
   Biglycan, collagen type I and II showed no significant difference from
   the control group. Further study is required to determine the resulting
   effect of increased mRNA expressions on long-term disc health. However
   these results indicate that this research is past the proof of concept
   stage, supporting future studies of mechanobiology utilizing this new
   device. The next stage in developing this novel loading platform should
   consider modifying the tissue grips to explore the effects of different
   directional loading on different gene expression, and also loading
   different types of tissues. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Magnesium is the lightest structural metal and recently magnesium and
   its alloys have received increased attention in various engineering
   applications. Titanium is a light metal and shows excellent corrosion
   resistance and high specific strength. The ability to join these two
   metals together can increase their use in the automotive and aerospace
   industries. However, differences in the physical properties of these
   alloys (e.g. melting point for Ti-6Al-4V is 1650 degrees C and 680
   degrees C for AZ31) make the joining of these dissimilar alloys a great
   challenge. This research work presents the effect of one of the most
   important parameters in diffusion bonding; the bonding pressure.
   Optimizing bonding parameters resulted in sound joint with homogeneous
   microstructure and suitable mechanical properties. To join these two
   alloys the diffusion bonding was carried out using thin (20 mu m) pure
   Ni foils at different bonding pressures (0.2 and 0.7 MPa) at 515 degrees
   C as a function of holding time of 5 to 30 minutes. The results showed a
   direct relation exist between bonding pressure, joint microstructure and
   mechanical properties. Reaction zones were identified inside bonding
   region and tested with respect to hardness profile. In case of 0.2 MPa
   pressure the joint width increased from 86 mu m for bonding time of 5
   minutes to 197 mu m for 20 minutes. A decrease in joint width to 144 mu
   m at bonding time of 30 minutes shows that isothermal solidification
   starts for a bonding time of 20 minutes. However, when bonding at 0.7
   MPa pressure the joint width increased from 59 gm for bonding time of 5
   minutes to 156 gm at 10 minutes. A decrease to 123 gm at bonding time of
   20 minutes was recorded. Even further decrease to 75 pm at bonding time
   of 30 minutes was noticed. This suggest Isothermal solidification takes
   place in case of 0.7 MPa earlier than in case of 0.2 MPa.}},

Abstract = {{Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease that leads to the
   articular cartilage (AC) degeneration and joint function loss. Early
   stage OA is primarily associated with proteoglycan (PG) loss and
   collagen structure changes. The MR T2 imaging is a promising
   non-invasive diagnostic tool that has shown the potential to reflect
   changes in the biochemical composition of cartilage with early OA. T2
   relaxation times give a quantitative measure of the molecular
   interactions occurring within the imaged cartilage tissues. It can
   represent cartilage tissue biochemical character that can be quantified
   with the help of specific imaging strategies.
   The goal of this study was to apply Levenberg-Marquardt curve fitting
   algorithm for T2 mapping quantification and T2 relaxation time
   calculation to study T2 relaxation characters based on quantitative MR
   T2 imaging of the tibiofemoral condyle cartilage. The MR T2 images of a
   healthy male volunteer's right knee were generated by a 3T MRI scanner
   using a spin echo multislice multiecho (MSME) Carr-Purcell Meiboom-Gill
   (CPMG) sequence. The medial and lateral tibiofemoral condyle cartilage
   was further subdivided into the regions of interest (ROIs) for
   identifying variation in T2 values. T2 relaxation times mean and
   standard deviation of ROIs were calculated using Levenberg-Marquardt
   curve fitting algorithm with correction and without correction.
   The results show that the Levenberg-Marquardt curve fitting algorithm
   was feasible for T2 relaxation time calculation of tibiofemoral
   cartilage, the CPMG sequence was sensitive to cartilage tissue imaging,
   and T2 parameter can be used for the characterization of articular
   cartilage tissue.}},

Abstract = {{An efficient and high-performance semi-blind scheme is proposed for
   Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems by iteratively combining
   channel estimation with K-Best Sphere Decoding (SD). To avoid the
   exponentially increasing complexity of Maximum Likelihood Detection
   (MLD) while achieving a near optimal MLD performance, K-best SD is
   considered to accomplish data detection. Semi-blind iterative estimation
   is adopted for identifying the MIMO channel matrix. Specifically, a
   training-based least squares channel estimate is initially provided to
   the K-best SD data detector, and the channel estimator and the data
   detector then iteratively exchange information to perform the
   decision-directed channel update and consequently to enhance the
   detection performance. The proposed scheme is capable of approaching the
   ideal detection performance obtained with the perfect MIMO channel state
   information.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the inverse relation between cable length and transmission bit
   rate, many current DSL deployments do not truly benefit from the wide
   spectrum of VDSL2. In this paper, we propose a new DSL network
   technology, called DSL Rings (DSLRs), to overcome the challenge of long
   cable runs in DSL networks. Utilizing MIMO techniques from the central
   office to the pedestal and a ring network between the pedestal and the
   houses, DSLR achieves aggregate transmission rates up to 225 Mbits/s.
   Measurements on Cat3 cables are conducted to characterize crosstalk
   interference that is unique to this new architecture. The achievable
   symbol bit rates are then calculated using these measurements. The
   results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture in
   providing VDSL2 technology over fiber to the exchange (FTTEx)
   deployments.}},

Abstract = {{Electronically scanned digital antenna array apertures have important
   applications in ultra-wideband digital beamsteering for cognitive radio,
   imaging, radio astronomy, wireless communications and sensing. The use
   of 2-D IIR frequency-planar beam plane-wave filters as a low complexity
   alternative for phased array algorithms is currently receiving
   attention. In this work, a systolic array VLSI architectures for the
   real-time implementation of the 2-D IIR beam plane-wave filter has been
   designed by replacing unit delays along both space and time dimensions
   with first order discrete integrators, thereby leading to lower
   sensitivity to filter coefficient quantization which in turn results in
   improved RF beam accuracy. The proposed designs have reduced error in
   the magnitude transfer function compared to the usual direct form
   structures. Beam filters of order 1 and 2 are designed using integral
   form realization. The designs show small gain magnitude error of 0.3\%
   for 1st-order beam filter with respect to digital feedback coefficients
   of the filter which have been chosen at 13-bits of precision. The design
   examples also show a small gain magnitude error of 1.5\% in a 2nd-order
   beam filter with filter feedback coefficients having 15-bits of
   precision. This is an improvement over comparable direct form
   architectures. Prototype circuits for the proposed integral form beam
   filters have been designed and simulated using Xilinx Virtex 6
   xc6vsx475t-1ff1759 FPGA devices.}},

   presented that quantifies the texture of masses without relying on
   accurate extraction of their contours. Two novel feature descriptors

   tests were designed for this purpose. Measures of radial correlation and
   radial trend were extracted from the original gray-scale values as well
   as from the Gabor magnitude response of 146 regions of interest,
   including 120 benign masses and 26 malignant tumors. Four classifiers,
   Fisher-linear discriminant analysis, Bayesian, support vector machine,
   and an artificial neural network based on radial basis functions
   (ANN-RBF), were employed to predict the diagnosis, using stepwise
   logistic regression for feature selection and the leave-one-patient-out

Abstract = {{Large scale disasters often create the need for evacuating affected
   regions to save lives. Disaster management authorities need evacuation
   simulation tools to assess the efficiency of various evacuation
   scenarios and the impact of a variety of environmental and social
   factors on the evacuation process. Therefore, sound simulation models
   should include the relevant factors influencing the evacuation process
   and allow for the representation of different levels of detail, in order
   to support large scale evacuation simulation while also offering the
   option of considering factors operating at a finer level of detail, such
   as at the single individual level. In particular, the impact of social
   factors, such as interaction between agents, should be integrated into
   the simulation model to reflect the reality of evacuation processes. In
   this paper, we present a generic data model for agent-based evacuation
   simulation that includes the relevant social parameters identified in
   the emergency literature. The model is composed of three sub-models that
   describe the agents, their context and behaviour, the dynamic
   environment in which the agents evolve and the parameters of the
   evacuation scenario. The objective of this model is to improve the
   simulation so that it can be better represent reality.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a proposal for a new memory polynomial modeling
   technique with non-uniform delay taps to capture the thermal memory
   effects in power amplifiers. In the proposed modeling structure, each
   order of the memory polynomial is assigned a different memory delay. The
   delay profile is an exponentially shaped function, instead of equal unit
   delays for all memory polynomial branches. Three different metrics, the
   memory effect modeling ratio (MEMR) and the normalized mean square error
   (NMSE) and spectrum error (SE) are used to benchmark the proposed
   exponentially shaped delay profile memorial polynomial model performance
   against previously published models, namely the memoryless, the unit
   delay and sparse delay memory based polynomial models. The model
   coefficients of four models are extracted for three different excitation
   signals, which were selected as a 64-QAM signal around 2.14 GHz with 20
   kHz, 30 kHz and 40 kHz bandwidths, ensuring that the thermal memory
   effects dominate the electrical memory effects. It is shown that the
   proposed model outperforms all the previously published models for all
   three excitation signals used in the experiment.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon accumulation (coking) normally occurs at the Ni-yttria stabilized
   zirconia (YSZ) cermet anode of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) when they
   are operated on carbon-containing fuels, such as syngas (H-2 + CO). Here
   we show that the addition of ppm levels (4-17 ppm) of H2S to a syngas
   stream, at 600 degrees C and even at low current densities (5-15
   mA/cm(2)), prevents anode coking and stabilizes the anode performance,
   as demonstrated for the first time using 3-electrode methods. It is also
   shown that the onset of coking (in the absence of H2S) causes an initial
   improvement in anode performance, although this is only a transient
   phenomenon, eventually resulting in a highly degraded Ni-YSZ anode
   structure. Even so, this initially enhanced performance could
   potentially be used as an indicator of the onset of coking, thus
   allowing the modification of stack operating conditions to prolong their
   lifetime.}},

Abstract = {{We present an ab-initio thermodynamics model for sulfur poisoning of Ni.
   This model explicitly includes both the competitive adsorption of H-2
   and H2S as well as adsorbate coverage effects. Our results show that the
   adsorption energy for both H2S and H-2 on Ni is a strong function of
   surface species coverage while the entropy of adsorption is weakly
   dependent on coverage. We outline the derivation of the
   coverage-dependent surface species chemical potential, use it to
   calculate the predicted equilibrium coverages of S and H on Ni across a
   wide range of industrially relevant reaction conditions, and compare our
   results with data in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Small wind turbine blades share a number of features with large blades,
   but have some important differences. The two main differences are their
   much higher rotational speed, which causes more fatigue cycles and

   means that thick aerofoil sections cannot be used near the root. This
   chapter discusses the design challenges arising from these differences,
   the materials commonly used for blade manufacture, and the fatigue
   testing of small blades. The use of timber is highlighted for very small
   blades, and fibre-reinforced composite manufacture of larger ones is
   discussed in terms of sustainability, conformity of manufactured shape,
   and fatigue behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{The viscous fingering instability of miscible flow displacements in a

   chemical reactions between the fluids. The problem is formulated using
   continuity equation, Darcy's law, and volume-averaged forms of
   convection-diffusion-reaction equation for mass balance. Full nonlinear
   simulations using a pseudo-spectral method combined with semi-implicit
   finite-difference time-stepping algorithm, allowed to analyze the
   mechanisms of fingering instability that result from the dependence of
   the fluids viscosities on the concentrations of the different species.
   In particular, the study examined the effects of varying important
   parameters namely the Damkohler number that represents the ratio of the
   hydrodynamic and chemical characteristic time scales, and the chemical
   reversibility coefficient, and analyzed the resulting changes in the
   finger structures.}},

Abstract = {{The paper introduces a new filter inspired by Frangi's Vesselness
   filter. The latter has been used for enhancement and noise/background
   suppression in medical images. The proposed modification allows for the
   filter parameters adjustment to detect facial features, including eyes,
   eyebrows, nose and lips. The main contributions of this paper include:
   1) re-defining the multiscale filter previously used for vessel
   detection, and applying it to facial biometric; 2) proposing a way to
   adjust scales of the filter for facial images. In addition, the modified
   filter does not require applying different scales to perform filtering.
   This allows us to avoid the complex procedure for finding suitable
   scales, and, therefore, computational complexity. The method has been
   tested over multiple controlled and uncontrolled face databases and the
   results show the effectiveness of algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Most of the reported algorithms for facial expression recognition (FER)
   are based on visible expression databases. However, visible images are
   affected by illumination variations which can cause significant
   disparities in image appearance and texture. In this paper preliminary
   results of a new FER algorithm, using Gauss-Laguerre (GL) filter of
   circular harmonic wavelets to extract features for infrared images, are
   presented. By using GL filters with properly tuned-parameters, it is
   possible to generate a set of redundant wavelets that enable an accurate
   extraction of complex texture features from an infrared image. In
   addition, we utilize GL filters that are highly suitable for FER in
   visible images. The combination of infrared and visible FER using common
   feature extraction approach saves time and reduces the complexity in a
   multiple-sensors scenario. K-nearest neighbor is used for classification
   on OTCBVS and USTC-NVIE databases. The results show effective
   performance for using GL filters in FER for infrared images.}},

Abstract = {{The application of multi-dimensional (MD) infinite impulse response
   (IIR) space-time beam filters in radio source localization in cognitive
   radio (CR) environments is investigated. Knowledge of the position of
   radio sources in a CR network leads to the detection of white spaces in
   the MD frequency domain, thereby creating more opportunistic links for
   the secondary users. The use of MD IIR beam filters is motivated by
   their very low computational complexity and small side lobe levels
   compared to digital phased arrays. As a proof-of-concept, the two
   dimensional (2-D) propagation scenario including at least two receiver
   stations and a data fusion station, which combines the direction of
   arrival (DOA) estimates from the two receiver stations, to yield a
   position estimate, is considered. Each receiver station employs a
   uniform linear array (ULA) of antennas and a steerable 2-D IIR beam
   filter and provides information pertaining to peak energy directions.
   First order 2-D IIR beam filters are shown to provide acceptable DOA
   estimates with a SNR of 6 dB. The peak energy direction information
   leads to both position and MD white space detection.}},

Abstract = {{An electronically steerable broadband radio frequency (RF) filter-sum
   beamforming filter using 1 st -order allpass filters is proposed. The
   beamforming filter has the 2-D transfer function H-A (z(x), s(ct)),
   which uses M -section cascaded 1 st -order all-pass filters and analog
   combiners as building blocks. Beam steering is achieved by tuning the
   group delay of the allpass filters via a control voltage. For beam
   directions similar to 20. from array broadside, M = 1 provides close to
   ideal broadband response, and 1 < M <= 4 is shown to provide nearly
   ideal broadband response for beam directions > 20. The array factor of
   the beamformer is evaluated using 65 nm CMOS BSIM 4 simulations of the
   all-pass filters and a 4-channel RF combiner for a linear antenna array
   of 4 antennas and is shown to provide steerable beams at 1 GHz. The CMOS
   simulations verify a broadband response from DC to 1 GHz.}},

Abstract = {{Novel CMOS wide-bandwidth 1st- and 2nd-order current-mode allpass
   filters are proposed in this paper. The 1st-order filter consists of

   filter. A 1st-order allpass filter with delay of approximately 33 ps and
   pole-zero location of 10GHz is designed to confirm the circuit
   operation. The location of the pole-zero pair is confirmed with a
   current-mode quadrature oscillator based on the proposed allpass filter.
   A 2nd-order filter with maximum achievable delay-bandwidth-product is
   designed to achieve a group delay of approximate 60 ps across a 10GHz
   bandwidth. The performances of the wide-band allpass filters and
   current-mode quadrature oscillator are obtained in IBM 130-nm CMOS

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce an analog-design assistant tool (ADA), which
   was used to generate a database of 56,280 three-MOSFET circuit
   topologies. Having setup ADA to provide analog designers with amplifier
   topologies, it identified 5,103 three-MOSFET amplifiers based on the
   selection criteria given to the software. As an illustration of ADA
   capability of helping with circuit optimization, the transconductances
   of the transistors of each amplifier are automatically optimized by
   solving a nonlinear optimization problem that is set to maximize gains
   of circuits. In addition, ADA provides closed-form expressions of gain,
   input impedance, output impedance and reverse gain. To demonstrate that
   ADA can be used to identify and optimize new circuits, a previously
   unknown three-transistor amplifier with a high DC gain of similar to 40
   dB was randomly chosen and fully designed in a 0.13-mu m standard CMOS
   technology. The simulation results obtained with BSIM models show that
   the circuit topology provided by ADA is accurate and realizable. Using
   ADA will enable designers to save hours of time and provide them with
   range of circuits that are customized for their need.}},

Abstract = {{Navigation goal detection in complex real world scenarios is challenging
   for autonomous mobile robots due to the uncertainty and ambiguity of
   their environments. This paper proposes a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM)
   based situation assessment framework (SAF) for mobile robot navigation
   goal detection. A given navigation goal is described with several
   sub-goals using prior knowledge. Based upon these sub-goals, the
   proposed SAF operates recursively on the navigation goal to verify it.
   The decision fusion system combines sensory information from multiple
   sensors to verify the sub-goals. The FCM, which is realized using fuzzy
   gamma fusion, is used as a high level reasoning engine. The navigation
   goals are verified based on the rules which connect sub-goals together
   and the goal assertion confidence of sub-goals which is decided using
   FCM inference. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
   framework can accurately decide the navigation goals in unknown
   environments based on the sensory information and expert knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{A major challenge in design of distributed software systems is
   predicting and avoiding unexpected behaviors at the run time. Detecting
   those behaviors after the system is implemented can be very costly and
   detecting them during design and implementation stages is a cost
   effective alternative. Therefore, model-based verification at early
   design stages is an important step in designing distributed systems.
   Most of the existing verification techniques analyze system behaviors by
   going from specifications to state machines that model individual
   components' behaviors. Although those methods are shown to be effective
   in detecting unexpected behaviors for each component, they fail to
   detect the unexpected behaviors that occur at the system level. There
   exist a few ad-hoc methods to combine components' behavior into system
   level behavior. In this paper, we devise a method that considers
   interactions among components, and propose an algorithm to combine the
   behavior models of interacting components. The proposed algorithm can be
   used to perform automated system-level verification. A case study is
   developed to validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in
   detecting the implied scenarios for distributed system.}},

Abstract = {{Bio-inspired robotics is an emerging field of cognitive intelligence
   which is based on the fundamental assumption that the biological systems
   are capable of self organization, better capable to adapt themselves to
   their changing environment for survival. Based on these features,
   behaviours observed in the biological world can be transferred to robots
   which may mimic the underlying behavior of their natural counterparts
   for efficient collaboration and coordination. The focus of this study is
   the application of identical unidirectionally coupled chaotic foodwebs
   in a robot foraging task. The phase coupled system is used to drive
   multi-robots arranged in a star network topology. The efficiency of the
   synchronization of the high dimensional system which is used to create a
   biologically inspired robot is examined using symbolic dynamics. In this
   work, the bio-inspired two wheeled mobile robots arranged in a
   topological network are assigned a set of targets or fixed obstacles
   distributed arbitrarily in the same workspace. The coverage is completed
   when a specified portion of the workspace is covered by the multi-robot
   system. Simulation results for coverage demonstrate the merit of the
   proposed system in the application of cooperative task assignment and
   obstacle avoidance.}},

Abstract = {{In robot-assisted surgery, haptic devices as hand controllers play an
   important role in the surgeon's ability of manipulating tissues. Most
   research activities have focused on providing force feedback as haptic
   information. Considering a circular tracing task, we presented two
   models of torque feedback. On a Virtual Reality simulator of neuroArm, a
   robotic system for microscopic neurosurgery, we investigated the
   suitability of these models for rendering torque feedback of each
   rotational degree-of-freedom. Without sacrificing translational and
   rotational motion ranges, we verified that the device PHANToM Premium
   1.5/6DOF is adequate as a hand controller of neuroArm to replace the
   modified version of PHANToM Premium 1.5 interfacing originally with
   neuroArm. Using the device PHANToM Premium 1.5/6DOF, our preliminary
   results yielded a suitability of both models of torque feedback for
   performing a circular tracing task assisted by neuroArm.}},

Abstract = {{Road related deaths and injuries continue to be one of the highest
   incidents recorded in organizations. Road Safety has become a major
   concern worldwide. Therefore the United Nations has introduced a new
   movement: UN Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011-2020, which aims to
   reduce road deaths and injuries worldwide. An effective Safety
   Management System (SMS) can help in reducing risk of incidents, injuries
   and fatalities. The National Safety Council defines the three
   performance areas to benchmark SMS to be Leadership Management,
   Technical - Operational and Cultural - Behavioral. This paper proposes a
   systematic way of finding relationships between Technical - Operational
   factors, Cultural - Behavioral and Safety Management Systems through the
   use of Neural networks-fuzzy. A sample SMS is simulated using critical
   factors (environmental and road conditions). Moreover, neural networks
   are used to predict the next outcome given historical information of
   various parameters such as road and weather conditions. Fuzzy logic is
   used to fuzzify the membership functions. The model helps us understand
   the effects of factors such as snow, rain and Mean Temperature as well
   as the events reported by In Vehicle Monitoring System (IVMS) on the
   number of incidents recorded and the ``Road Safety Score{''}. To
   illustrate the methodology in this paper, the neural networks-fuzzy
   model is fed with environmental factors to see how they affect the
   overall number of incidents recorded on a daily basis in the City of
   Calgary.}},

   synchronization. The encryption principle of the new algorithm is
   analyzed quantitatively by various statistical tests. The cover image
   used in the technique is also obtained from the visual representation of
   the chaotic sequences. This new scheme enjoys the benefit of added
   security, high key space, high embedding capacity, imperceptibility and
   robustness of the hidden information in conjunction with Least
