Abstract = {{The multidetector HERACLES studies heavy-ion collisions at TRIUMF, with
   ion beams with an energy range between 8 to 15 MeV per nucleon.
   Seventy-eight detectors are axially distributed around the beam axis in

   reactions. Experimental data was collected by HERACLES from a
   radioactive Na-25 beam and a stable Mg-25 beam at 9.23 MeV per nucleon
   on a carbon target. For analysis, we compare experimental data with a
   hybrid code. Antisymmetrized Molecular Dynamics (AMD) treats the

Abstract = {{Techniques used in neutron activation analysis are often dependent on
   the experimental setup. In the context of developing a portable and high
   efficiency detection array, good energy resolution and half-life
   discrimination are difficult to obtain with traditional methods {[}1]
   given the logistic and financial constraints. An approach different from
   that of spectrum addition and standard spectroscopy analysis {[}2] was
   needed. The use of multiple detectors prompts the need for a flexible
   storage of acquisition data to enable sophisticated post processing of
   information. Analogously to what is done in heavy ion physics, gamma
   detection counts are stored as two-dimensional events. This enables
   post-selection of energies and time frames without the need to modify
   the experimental setup. This method of storage also permits the use of
   more complex analysis tools. Given the nature of the problem at hand, a
   light and efficient analysis code had to be devised. A thorough
   understanding of the physical and statistical processes {[}3] involved
   was used to create a statistical model. Maximum likelihood estimation
   was combined with metaheuristics to produce a sophisticated
   curve-fitting algorithm. Simulated and experimental data were fed into
   the analysis code prompting positive results in terms of half-life
   discrimination, peak identification and noise reduction. The code was
   also adapted to other fields of research such as heavy ion
   identification of the quasi-target (QT) and quasi-particle (QP). The
   approach used seems to be able to translate well into other fields of
   research.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents the synthesis details of titanium dioxide (TiO2)
   nanoparticles (NPs) of different shapes (nanospheres, nanorods and
   nanorhombics) using oleic acid (OA) and oleyl amine (OM) as capping
   agents. In order to develop nanocomposite thin films for photovoltaic
   cells, these TiO2 NPs were carefully dispersed in
   2-methoxy-5-(2'-ethylhexyloxy)-p-phenylene vinylene (MEH-PPV) matrix.
   The properties of synthesized TiO2 NPs and MEH-PPV/TiO2 nanocomposites
   were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
   thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), UV-Visible spectroscopy, and
   Photoluminescence technique. It was found that the shape of NPs and the
   amount of OA and OM surfactants capped on their surface have an effect
   on their energy bandgap and also on the dispersion quality of
   MEH-PPV/TiO2 nanocomposites. Even though there was no evidence of
   chemical bonding between MEH-PPV matrix and TiO2 dispersed NPs,
   MEH-PPV/TiO2 nanocomposites showed very promising results for light
   absorption properties and charge transfer at the interface of the
   conjugated MEH-PPV matrix and TiO2 dispersed NPs, which are two main
   characteristics for photovoltaic materials.}},

Abstract = {{In two previous studies, wood fiber-reinforced polymer composites (WPC)
   were prepared via melt processing. In particular, a response surface
   strategy of a 20 run optimal design for these three factors was adopted.
   It was found that for these WPC mixing torque, melt viscosity, Young's
   modulus and tensile stress at break were related to the type of wood
   used, as well as wood and coupling agent contents. In addition, thermal
   properties and strain at break were mainly affected by wood and coupling
   agent contents. Here, a more complete characterization of these WPC
   under extreme environmental conditions is performed. In particular, the
   effect of coupling agent content, wood fibre content and wood fibre type
   on water absorption and flexural modulus are reported under different
   water immersion time and temperature. The results show that water
   absorption is influenced by all the parameters studied, while flexural
   modulus is mainly influenced by wood content and immersion temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Delineation of soil management zones in agricultural fields using
   reliable indicators is a major issue in precision agriculture. The leaf
   area index (LAI) is an important variable for the characterization of
   in-field variability. However, ground LAI measurement over large fields
   is time consuming. Our objective was to compare machine learning methods
   to describe in-field potato LAI patterns from airborne multispectral
   images. To this aim, intensive ground LAI measurements (97 quadrats)
   were collected in a potato field at the time of maximum LAI. Two methods
   were trained as function approximation, validated, and compared to
   linear regressions. The two methods were (i) multiple-layer perceptron
   (MLP) and (ii) least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM). After
   model training, spatial interpolation was performed and results were
   compared to a map interpolated with measured values. Both methods
   performed well using near-infrared and red channels as inputs. However,
   the gain in performance in validation over the best linear model was
   higher for the LS-SVM (29\%) compared to the MLP (15\%), and the kappa
   coefficient of agreement was higher during classification. The LS-SVM
   with 2 inputs (near-infrared and red) was therefore retained as the
   final model.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work is to investigate the effects of restrained thermal
   elongation on the behaviour of Reinforced Concrete (RC) beams and
   columns in a natural fire environment. A finite element model, capable
   of analysing the behaviour of restrained RC elements from pre-fire
   stages to collapse is used. Through the results of the parametric study,
   it is shown that conventional failure based on material failure and
   deflection criteria may not be conservative under some fire scenarios.
   Based on the strength and restraining forces failure criteria, the fire
   resistance of RC slender beams and columns was found to decrease by
   increasing the axial restraint stiffness. It was also found that the
   conventional method based on standard fire exposure may not be
   conservative for columns if the resulting fire has a decay phase similar
   to the severe fire scenario used in this study.}},

Abstract = {{As the integrated management of urban wastewater systems becomes more

   models appears essential to improve the understanding of the pollutant
   dynamics and their interactions. In such a context, a review of the
   literature reveals a lack of efficient models describing the dynamics of
   the water quality stored in off-line retention tanks. A model has thus
   been proposed based on the fractionation of suspended solids into three
   classes according to the particle settling velocity distribution
   measured in the field using the ViCAs settling test. In this paper, a
   calibration methodology is developed and full-scale field data sets from
   three different events are used for 1) calibrating this new dynamic
   retention tank model (two data sets); and 2) validating that model on
   the last data set. The results show a good agreement between observed
   and simulated data both for the total suspended solids and the total

Abstract = {{This paper explores the maximal volume inscribed ellipsoid in the
   singularity free constant-orientation workspace of two classes of 6-UPS
   parallel mechanisms, namely, quadratic and quasi-quadratic Gough-Stewart
   platforms. It is of paramount importance to obtain the optimum
   singularity-free ellipsoid by taking into account the stroke of
   actuators. Convex optimization is applied as the fundamental
   optimization tool of this paper. For this purpose, a matrix modeling for
   the kinematic properties of Gough-Stewart platform is proposed. The main
   contribution of this paper consists in improving an existing method in a
   such a way that it leads to a global optimum rather than a suboptimal
   solution. The proposed algorithm could be regarded as one of the most
   reliable, in terms of obtaining the global extremum, and propitious
   approaches, in terms of computational time in comparison with other
   approaches proposed in the literature for obtaining the singularity-free
   workspace which make it suitable for real-time applications.}},

Abstract = {{Modelling has played a key role in the evolution of insights on the
   Waterloo Moraine groundwater system as a water source for Waterloo
   Region. As models evolved over the last four decades, so did new
   insights. Starting from a simple layer-cake concept, models eventually
   became three-dimensional, while the focus changed from well interference
   to multi-layer analysis, capture zone delineation, wellhead protection
   areas, groundwater age and the prediction of impact due to various land
   uses and threats. An important insight gained was that the reliability
   of predictive methods depends heavily on the travel paths from source to
   receptor, which in turn depend on the connectivity between the various
   units - i.e. the conceptual model. The elusive issue of predictive
   uncertainty in the delineation of well capture zones is approached at
   two scales: the local scale representing uncertainty due to
   heterogeneities within the individual aquifer units, and the global
   scale representing different conceptualizations and scenarios, where the
   latter is found to be the dominant uncertainty. In the case of a
   multi-scenario analysis involving scenarios of equal plausibility, the
   precautionary approach can be used to arrive at a conservative
   prediction. Practical applications provide insights on the dynamics of
   groundwater systems, the impact of changes and threats being imposed and
   the effectiveness of mitigation measures, as well as the time scale at
   which threats and mitigation measures act. These insights should help
   hydrogeologists to use models more effectively, and to better understand
   and manage predictive uncertainties that inevitably arise in dealing
   with complex groundwater systems such as the Waterloo Moraine.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with imperfect preventive maintenance (PM) optimisation
   problem. The system to be maintained is typically a production system
   assumed to be continuously monitored and subject to stochastic
   degradation. To assess such degradation, the proposed maintenance model
   takes into account both corrective maintenance (CM) and PM. The system
   undergoes PM whenever its reliability reaches an appropriate value,
   while CM is performed at system failure. After a given number of
   maintenance actions, the system is preventively replaced by a new one.
   Both CM as well as PM are considered imperfect, i.e. they bring the
   system to an operating state which lies between two extreme states,
   namely the as bad as old state and as good as new state. The imperfect
   effect of CM and PM is modelled on the basis of the hybrid hazard rate
   model. The objective of the proposed PM optimisation model consists on
   finding the optimal reliability threshold together with the optimal
   number of PM actions to maximise the average availability of the system.
   A mathematical model is then proposed. To solve this problem an
   algorithm is provided. A numerical example is presented to illustrate
   the proposed maintenance optimisation model.}},

Abstract = {{This article develops an experimental platform to select production
   planning policy in demand-driven wood remanufacturing industry. This
   industry is characterised by divergent co-production, alternative
   processes, a make-to-order philosophy and short order cycle times. Under
   such complex characteristics, the selection of an efficient production
   plan is a complex task. Previous work has failed to address all the
   industrial characteristics encountered in wood remanufacturing mills.
   After defining key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the
   production plan efficiency, our methodology uses a periodic re-planning
   strategy based on a rolling horizon. Then, mixed-integer programming
   models are formulated leading to different planning approaches. Finally,
   the resulting decision framework is experimented to prescribe the best
   planning policy based on the selected KPI. Each production planning is
   characterised by its planning approach and factors related to the
   re-planning interval and the planning horizon length. Simulations are
   conducted using multiple best subset selections combined with an
   experimental design approach. Using industrial data from a wood
   remanufacturing mill in Eastern Canada, results indicate that the
   manufacturing mill should use a planning approach that minimises cost,
   while utilising the full system capacity. Results also quantify the
   benefit of using lower re-planning intervals and higher planning
   horizons.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the selective maintenance optimization problem for
   a multi-mission series-parallel system. Such a system experiences
   several missions with breaks between successive missions. The
   reliability of the system is given by the conditional probability that
   the system survives the next mission given that it has survived the
   previous mission. The reliability of each system component is
   characterized by its hazard function. To maintain the reliability of the
   system, preventive maintenance actions are performed during breaks. Each
   preventive maintenance action is characterized by its age reduction
   coefficient. The selective maintenance problem consists in finding an
   optimal sequence of maintenance actions, to be performed within breaks,
   so that to minimize the total maintenance cost while providing a given
   required system reliability level for each mission. To solve such a
   combinatorial optimization problem, an optimization method is proposed
   on the basis of the genetic algorithm. A numerical example is provided

Abstract = {{Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are considered as clean and
   efficient energy conversion devices with great potential to replace
   currently used internal combustion engines (ICEs) in the near future.
   Developing high-performance and less expensive non-precious metal
   electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode side
   is crucial for widespread application of PEMFCs. Herein an Fe-containing
   metal-organic framework (MOF) was employed as the sole precursor for
   preparing a cathode electrocatalyst. The Fe-MOF was synthesized and
   subsequently subjected to thermolysis under a non-reactive gas
   atmosphere followed by acid leaching and heat treatment under NH3 at
   different temperatures between 700 and 1000 degrees C. Upon pyrolysis,
   iron-nitrogen containing carbon active sites (Fe/N/C) were formed in
   parallel with development of an electronically conductive carbon medium
   produced through pyrolytic carbonization of the organic component of the
   MOF material. The prepared electrocatalysts were characterized by XRD,
   N-2 physisorption, TEM and XPS. In a H2SO4 (pH = 1) electrolyte, the ORR
   onset potential of 0.915 V, and the half-wave potential of 0.811 V are
   achieved using the most promising electrocatalyst (C700/950). The
   membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) made of these electrocatalysts were
   also tested as a cathode in a H-2/air single fuel cell. The most
   promising electrocatalyst (C700/950) demonstrated an open circuit
   voltage of 0.945 V and a maximum power density of 0.302 W cm(-2) reached
   at 0.391 V.}},

Abstract = {{This letter studies the performance of the line-of-sight underground
   mine channel in the millimeter-wave band. Using a vector network
   analyzer (VNA) and three carefully chosen antennas, one omni and two
   horn antennas, we performed measurements at the 40- and 70-m levels in
   the CANMET mine located in Val-d'Or, QC, Canada. The performance of the
   channel is studied in terms of its path-loss exponent, shadowing, and
   capacity. Results prove that the path-loss exponent in an underground
   mine is smaller than the free-space value. The shadow fading fits very
   well with the normal distribution. A model of the capacity as a function
   of the distance between transmitter and receiver is investigated.
   Channel capacity depends on the multipath characteristics; the capacity
   found in the narrow environment (70 m) is higher than in the wider
   environment (40 m). The results also show that it is better to use
   omnidirectional antennas for a wireless communication system in the

Journal = {{HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Diagnosing the impacts of climate change on water resources is a
   difficult task pertaining to the uncertainties arising from the
   different modelling steps. Lumped hydrological model structures
   contribute to this uncertainty as well as the natural climate
   variability, illustrated by several members from the same Global
   Circulation Model. In this paper, the hydroclimatic modelling chain
   consists of twenty-four potential evapotranspiration formulations,
   twenty lumped conceptual hydrological models, and seven snowmelt
   modules. These structures are applied on a natural Canadian
   sub-catchment to address related uncertainties and compare them to the
   natural internal variability of simulated climate system as depicted by
   five climatic members. Uncertainty in simulated streamflow under current
   and projected climates is assessed. They rely on interannual hydrographs
   and hydrological indicators analysis. Results show that natural climate
   variability is the major source of uncertainty, followed by potential
   evapotranspiration formulations and hydrological models. The selected
   snowmelt modules, however, do not contribute much to the uncertainty.
   The analysis also illustrates that the streamflow simulation over the
   current climate period is already conditioned by the tools' selection.
   This uncertainty is propagated to reference simulations and future
   projections, amplified by climatic members. These findings demonstrate
   the importance of opting for several climatic members to encompass the
   important uncertainty related to the climate natural variability, but
   also of selecting multiple modelling tools to provide a trustworthy
   diagnosis of the impacts of climate change on water resources.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss recent progress and challenges in realizing Bragg-grating
   devices on the submicron silicon-on-insulator platform for
   next-generation optical communications applications, such as on-chip
   optical interconnects and signal processing. In particular, we focus on
   grating-assisted, wavelength-selective couplers, known as
   contra-directional couplers (contra-DCs). In contrast to conventional
   two-port Bragg gratings operating in the reflection mode, contra-DCs are
   four-port devices with very weak backreflections and, therefore, can be
   easily integrated with other photonic components on a chip. In order to
   provide a reliable on-chip wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM)
   solution for high-speed optical interconnects, we have developed
   high-performance add-drop filters and, furthermore, wavelength
   multiplexers/demultiplexers with combined advantages of flat-top
   responses, low insertion loss (< 1 dB), and low crosstalk (< -23 dB).
   These WDM devices are ultra-compact and highly tolerant to temperature
   fluctuations (up to +/- 50 degrees C), showing great potential for
   large-scale integration and low-power consumption. We further discuss a
   novel four-port Bragg photonic resonator for high-speed, low-power
   optical switching. Using a coupler-chirped design with uniform Bragg
   gratings, we have recently achieved an on-chip, continuously tunable
   photonic delay line with low insertion loss. These system-orientated
   devices indicate great potential for large-scale integration of
   Bragg-grating-defined functions using CMOS-compatible silicon photonics
   technology.}},

Title = {{Hydrogeology and hydrogeochemistry of the Chaudiere River watershed
   aquifers, Quebec, Canada}},
Journal = {{CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{32-48}},
Abstract = {{A comprehensive hydrogeological study has been conducted in the
   Chaudiere River watershed (6695 km(2)) located south of the St. Lawrence
   River, near Quebec City. Updated maps of simplified bedrock geology and
   surficial sediments are presented together with the newly generated maps
   of the regional potentiometric surface, spatial distribution of the
   annual infiltration rate and spatial distribution of encountered
   groundwater types. Detailed analyses of the hydraulic conductivity,
   groundwater use, salinity sources and isotopic signatures are conducted.
   At the end, a conceptual model describing the hydrogeological setting is
   proposed for the regional groundwater flow system. In the watershed,
   about 150,000 inhabitants or roughly 80\% of the total population depend
   almost entirely on groundwater as a source of potable water.
   Fine-grained sedimentary rocks of the Appalachian geological province
   form the major regional aquifer unit. The aquifer is generally
   unconfined to semi-confined in the Appalachian Uplands, and
   semi-confined to confined in the Appalachian Piedmont. Local granular
   aquifers are composed of coarse river valley sediments, but their extent
   and thickness vary throughout the watershed. The hydraulic connection
   between the granular units and bedrock is strongly influenced by the
   nature of the ubiquitous glacial sediments. The overall recharge rate to
   the bedrock aquifers is estimated at about 27 mm/y, or roughly 180
   Mm(3)/y, compared to the average groundwater use of 17.4 Mm(3)/y. The
   low hydraulic conductivity, K similar to 8x10(-7) m/s, constrains
   groundwater flow to the top portion of the fractured strata. Groundwater
   flow in the Appalachian Uplands occurs at local scale and is dominated
   by recent recharge. Further along the flowpath in the Appalachian
   Piedmont, the concentrations of the major chemical constituents
   gradually increase along with the radiocarbon age of groundwater. Still,
   independent of their location along the flowpath, groundwater samples
   always contain a fraction of relatively young water (<= 50 years).}},

Abstract = {{In this study, three different CFRP specimens with internal artificial
   delaminations of various sizes and located at different depths were
   investigated by means of Pulsed Thermography (PT) under laboratory
   conditions. The three CFRP panels, having the same thickness and defects
   characteristics but with a different shape (planar, trapezoid and
   curved), were assessed after applying various signal processing tools on
   the acquired thermal data (i.e. Thermographic Signal Reconstruction,
   Pulsed Phase Thermography and Principal Component Thermography). The
   effectiveness of the above processing tools was initially evaluated in a
   qualitative manner, comparing the imaging outputs and the information
   retrieval in terms of defect detectability enhancement and noise
   reduction. Simultaneously, the produced defect detectability was
   evaluated through Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) computations, quantifying
   the image quality and the intensity contrast produced between the
   defected area and the adjacent background area of the test panel. From
   the results of this study, it can be concluded that the implementation
   of PT along with the application of advanced signal processing
   algorithms can be a useful technique for NDT assessment, providing
   enhanced qualitative information. Nevertheless, SNR analysis showed that
   despite the enhanced visibility resulting from these algorithms, these
   can be properly applied in order to retrieve the best possible
   information according to the user's demands.}},

Abstract = {{A strongly decelerated turbulent boundary layer is investigated by
   direct numerical simulation. Transition to turbulence is triggered by a
   trip wire which is modelled using the immersed boundary method. The
   Reynolds number close to the exit of the numerical domain is Re-theta =
   2175 and the shape-factor is H = 2.5. The analysis focuses on the latter
   portion of the flow with large velocity defect, at higher Reynolds
   numbers and further from the transition region. Mean velocity profiles
   do not reveal a logarithmic law. Departure from the law of the wall
   occurs throughout the inner region. The production and Reynolds stress
   peaks move to roughly the middle of the boundary layer. The profiles of
   the uv correlation factor reveal that u and v become less correlated
   throughout the boundary layer as the mean velocity defect increases,
   especially near the wall. The structure parameter is low in the present
   How, similar to equilibrium APG flows and mixing layers, and decreases
   as the mean velocity defect increases. The statistics of the upper half
   of the boundary layer resemble those of a mixing layer. Furthermore,
   various two-dimensional two-point correlation maps are obtained. The
   C-vv and C-ww correlations obtained far from the transition region at
   Re-theta = 2175 and at y/delta = 0.4 coincide with results obtained for
   a ZPG boundary layer, implying that the structure of the v, w
   fluctuations is the same as in ZPG. However, C-uu indicates that the
   structure of the u fluctuation in this APG boundary layer is almost
   twice as short as the ZPG one. The APG structures are also less
   correlated with the flow at the wall. The near-wall structures are
   different from ZPG flow ones in that streaks are much shorter or absent.}},

Title = {{Functional Divergence and Evolutionary Turnover in Mammalian
   Phosphoproteomes}},
Journal = {{PLOS GENETICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Protein phosphorylation is a key mechanism to regulate protein
   functions. However, the contribution of this protein modification to
   species divergence is still largely unknown. Here, we studied the
   evolution of mammalian phosphoregulation by comparing the human and
   mouse phosphoproteomes. We found that 84\% of the positions that are
   phosphorylated in one species or the other are conserved at the residue
   level. Twenty percent of these conserved sites are phosphorylated in
   both species. This proportion is 2.5 times more than expected by chance
   alone, suggesting that purifying selection is preserving
   phosphoregulation. However, we show that the majority of the sites that
   are conserved at the residue level are differentially phosphorylated
   between species. These sites likely result from false-negative
   identifications due to incomplete experimental coverage, false-positive
   identifications and non-functional sites. In addition, our results
   suggest that at least 5\% of them are likely to be true differentially
   phosphorylated sites and may thus contribute to the divergence in
   phosphorylation networks between mouse and humans and this, despite
   residue conservation between orthologous proteins. We also showed that
   evolutionary turnover of phosphosites at adjacent positions ( in a
   distance range of up to 40 amino acids) in human or mouse leads to an
   over estimation of the divergence in phosphoregulation between these two
   species. These sites tend to be phosphorylated by the same kinases,
   supporting the hypothesis that they are functionally redundant. Our
   results support the hypothesis that the evolutionary turnover of
   phosphorylation sites contributes to the divergence in phosphorylation
   profiles while preserving phosphoregulation. Overall, our study provides
   advanced analyses of mammalian phosphoproteomes and a framework for the
   study of their contribution to phenotypic evolution.}},

Volume = {{38}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an advanced method to optimise the compliant
   structure of force-torque sensors at the design stage. To this end, some
   researchers used finite element analysis on the whole compliant
   structure or some of its components, while others proposed performance
   indices based on mechanism theory. This work proposes a new approach,
   which relies on a symbolic formulation of the wrench-displacement
   relationship, and by which we minimise the condition number of this
   linear input-output relationship. Our method is centered on the
   application requirements, thus, it takes into account constraints such
   as the measurement range, the maximum allowed compliance or maximum
   physical dimensions of the structure. Thus, the input-output
   relationship allows to match applied forces with sensor displacements to
   achieve a prescribed sensitivity. The resulting performance index can be
   expressed symbolically, which eases the synthesis task. The optimisation
   procedure, design, fabrication and experiments of a three-axis force
   sensor architecture are also presented to illustrate the theory.}},

Title = {{Mathematical modeling and experimental validation of the mass transfer
   during unidirectional progressive cryoconcentration of skim milk}},
Journal = {{INNOVATIVE FOOD SCIENCE \& EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical model has been developed and experimentally validated to
   explain the process of unidirectional progressive cryoconcentration of
   skim milk. The capture coefficient determining the process efficiency
   was freezing rate dependent and the solute flow at the ice/liquid
   boundary layer was dependent of the competition between the heat and
   mass transfer phenomena. The dependence of the solute capture
   coefficient on the freezing velocity and the velocity of the ice/liquid
   interface zone was the key to understand the quantitative mass transfer
   to the bulk of the solution or the solute entrapment into the ice
   matrix. The experimental data for skim milk unidirectional progressive
   cryoconcentration showed that in a wide range of the ice/liquid
   interface velocity, and except for its smallest values, physical
   entrapment of the solute into the ice matrix during ice crystal growth
   is the predominant phenomenon. For practical purposes, it has been shown
   that the use of unidirectional progressive cryoconcentration for skim
   milk concentration is not efficient. Skim milk was cryoconcentrated from
   8.50 +/- 0.25\% up to approximately 18\% but the process efficiency
   significantly decreased as the ice thickness was increased. The highest
   process efficiency with an average value of 80\% has been obtained up to
   2 cm ice thickness. This efficiency drastically decreased after that to
   around of 3-4\%. This decrease of the process efficiency was confirmed
   by the high solute entrapment into the ice matrix, a phenomenon that
   yielded in similar solute concentration in the liquid fraction and in
   the ice matrix.
   Industrial relevance: cryoconcentration (freeze concentration) is the
   best technological approach to concentrate liquid food with maintaining
   high quality of the concentrate. Cryoconcentration preserves the taste,
   aroma, color and high nutritive value of the product. Nowadays, this
   technique is still under used in the food industry. This is due to the
   serious lack of information on the mechanism and economic aspects of
   this technology. Several efforts have been made to improve the
   cryoconcentration process efficiency. The results obtained in this paper
   which are based on mathematical modeling followed by experimental
   validation showed that progressive cryoconcentration is not effective to
   concentrate liquid foods. The main reason is the high solute entrapment
   in the ice fraction. Thus, more detailed studies on other types of
   cryoconcentration techniques are required. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Design of multicomponent photocatalysts for hydrogen production under
   visible light using water-soluble titanate nanodisks}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{4819-4829}},
Abstract = {{We report the design of efficient multicomponent photocatalysts (MPs)
   for H-2 production under visible light by using water-soluble ultrathin
   titanate nanodisks (TNDs) stabilized by tetraethylammonium cations
   (TEA(+)) as building blocks. The photocatalysts are designed in such a
   way to significantly enhance simultaneously the efficiency of the three
   main steps in the photocatalytic process i.e., light absorption, charge
   separation and catalytic reaction. We show, as an example, the
   construction of water-soluble CdS-TND-Ni MPs. The designed CdS-TND-Ni
   MPs, in which CdS nanoparticles and TNDs are intimately assembled to
   enhance the charge transfer and surface area, are controlled in
   composition to optimize visible light absorption. The conception of the
   MPs allows them to be highly dispersed in water which markedly improves
   the photocatalytic H2 production process. Most importantly, a Ni
   co-catalyst is selectively located on the surface of TNDs, enabling
   vectorial electron transfer from CdS to TND and to Ni, which drastically
   improves the charge separation. Consequently, under visible light
   illumination (lambda >= 420 nm), the optimally designed CdS-TND-Ni MPs
   could generate H2 from ethanol-water solution with rate as high as
   15.326 mmol g(-1) h(-1) during a reaction course of 15 h and with an
   apparent quantum yield of 24\% at 420 nm. Moreover, we also demonstrate
   that TNDs can be combined with other single or mixed metal sulfide to
   form water-soluble metal sulfide-TNDs composites which could also be of
   great interest for photocatalytic H2 production.}},

Abstract = {{Repeated games are an important mathematical formalism to model and

   science. Contrary to a number of existing surveys of repeated games,
   most of which originated from the economic research community, we are
   first to pay a special attention to a number of important distinctive
   features proper to artificial agents. More precisely, artificial agents,
   as opposed to the human agents mainly aimed by the economic research,
   are usually bounded whether in terms of memory or performance.
   Therefore, their decisions have to be based on the strategies defined
   using finite representations. Furthermore, these strategies have to be
   efficiently computed or approximated using a limited computational

Journal = {{POLYMER CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) polymerisation and nucleophilic
   aromatic substitution polycondensation are used to synthesize
   alternating copolymers based on polyetherethersulfone (PEES) blocks.
   ADMET results in incorporation of trans-allyl groups with more than 94
   to 98\% selectivity. The resulting polymers have a M-w of up to 13 600 g
   mol(-1) and low dispersity (D = 1.1 to 1.4). Polycondensation, on the
   other hand, allows incorporation of either cis-or trans-allyl groups
   depending on the starting monomers. Molecular weights in the same range
   are obtained, but with much larger dispersity (up to 2.3), as expected.
   Characterization by differential scanning calorimetry and wide angle
   X-ray diffraction shows that incorporation of the cis group completely
   suppresses crystallization, whereas that of the trans group results in
   semi-crystalline polymers. Crystallinity is lost post-melting, but can
   be restored using appropriate solvent treatments. The crystal form
   changes with the length of the etherethersulfone (EES) group indicating
   that, when the repeat unit is small (containing a 4-ring
   etherethersulfone (EES) block), the allyl function is incorporated into
   the crystallographic repeat, whereas when the EES segment increases to
   eight rings, the allyl group is excluded from the crystal phase.
   Post-functionalization of the allyl group is demonstrated by using
   hydrogenation. The resulting polymer adopts a different crystal form for
   the 4-ring block, but the same crystal form for the 8-ring block,
   confirming the dependence on the block length for incorporation into the
   crystallographic repeat unit.}},

Abstract = {{Macrovoid structured mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) composed of nano-size

   1,3,5-trimethyl-2,6-phenylenediamine) with different proportions (1 : 1
   and 1 : 4) and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) via the sol-gel method. The
   separation performance of MMMs with 6FDA-ODA-DAM treated at high
   temperature (450 degrees C) was excellent for CO2/CH4 separation (for
   6FOD-ODA-DAM (1 : 1): CO2 permeability similar to 265 Barrer and CO2/CH4
   selectivity similar to 32; for 6FOD-ODA-DAM (1 : 4): CO2 permeability
   similar to 302 Barrer and CO2/CH4 selectivity similar to 25).
   Remarkably, the best membrane could resist pressure up to 600 psi
   without any loss of permselectivity. The CO2/CH4 separation performance
   of a series of silica-6FDA-ODA-DAM(11) MMMs with different SiO2 loadings
   is theoretically predicted using a modified Maxwell model where both gas
   permeability and macrovoid shape factor are simultaneously considered as
   adjustable parameters. Applying the optimized values, the modified

Abstract = {{The temperature dissipation rate inferred from the balance of (phi(2))
   over bar /2 budget is used for the purpose of studying different methods
   employed to directly measure dissipation. The terms involved in the
   budget equation of temperature variance are measured with laser Doppler
   velocimetry and cold-wire thermometry used simultaneously. This study
   focuses on the centerline of a turbulent round jet, in the far field, at
   high Reynolds number (x/D = 30, Re-D = 1.5 x 10(5) and Re-lambda = 548).
   Particular attention is devoted to statistical convergence of second-
   and third-order moments of velocity and temperature fluctuations.
   Temperature dissipation obtained by Taylor's hypothesis and radial
   temperature derivative spectra confirm local isotropy. A high level of
   low wave number content is reported for the longitudinal derivative
   spectra, probably due to transverse mode spectral aliasing and noise
   contamination for small wire separation. A parallel is drawn between
   finite difference formulations and the behavior of the autocorrelation
   coefficient for small wire separations. The temperature dissipation
   estimates found are close to the budget reference value, but spectral
   analysis cast doubts on the validity of the streamwise derivative
   obtained with a pair of probes.}},

Abstract = {{A majority of MRI procedures requiring intravascular injections of
   contrast agents are performed with paramagnetic chelates. Such products
   induce vascular signal enhancement and they are rapidly excreted by the
   kidneys. Unfortunately, each chelate is made of only one paramagnetic
   ion, which, taken individually, has a limited impact on the MRI signal.
   In fact, the detection of molecular events in the nanomolar range using
   T-1-weighted MRI sequences requires the design of ultra-small particles
   containing hundreds of paramagnetic ions per contrast agent unit.
   Ultra-small nanoparticles of manganese oxide (MnO, 6-8 nm diameter) have
   been developed and proposed as an efficient and at least 1000 x more
   sensitive ``positive{''} MRI contrast agent. However no evidence has
   been found until now that an adequate surface treatment of these
   particles could maintain their strong blood signal enhancement, while
   allowing their rapid and efficient excretion by the kidneys or by the
   hepatobiliairy pathway. Indeed, the sequestration of MnO particles by
   the reticuloendothelial system followed by strong uptake in the liver
   and in the spleen could potentially lead to Mn2+-induced toxicity
   effects. For ultra-small MnO particles to be applied in the clinics, it
   is necessary to develop coatings that also enable their efficient
   excretion within hours. This study demonstrates for the first time the
   possibility to use MnO particles as T-1 vascular contrast agents, while
   enabling the excretion of > 70\% of all the Mn injected doses after 48
   h. For this, small, biocompatible and highly hydrophilic pegylated
   bis-phosphonate dendrons (PDns) were grafted on MnO particles to confer
   colloidal stability, relaxometric performance, and fast excretion
   capacity. The chemical and colloidal stability of MnO@PDn particles were
   confirmed by XPS, FTIR and DLS. The relaxometric performance of MnO@PDns
   as ``positive{''} MRI contrast agents was assessed (r(1) = 4.4 mM(-1)
   s(-1), r(2)/r(1) = 8.6; 1.41 T and 37 degrees C). Mice were injected
   with 1.21 mu g Mn per kg (22 mu mol Mn per kg), and scanned in MRI up to
   48 h. The concentration of Mn in key organs was precisely measured by
   neutron activation analysis and confirmed, with MRI, the possibility to
   avoid RES nanoparticle sequestration through the use of phosphonate
   dendrons. Due to the fast kidney and hepatobiliairy clearance of MnO
   particles conferred by PDns, MnO nanoparticles can now be considered for
   promising applications in T1-weighted MRI applications requiring less
   toxic although highly sensitive ``positive{''} molecular contrast
   agents.}},

   Lawrence. This landslide had a width of 410 m and had retrogressed back
   up to 110 m from the slope crest, cutting through Highway 138, 9 km west
   of the town of Havre-St-Pierre. In this area, the coastal bluffs are
   approximately 23 m high and consist, from the bottom to the top, of a
   thick marine sensitive clay unit from the Goldthwait Sea, overlain by 3
   m of sand and 3 m of peat on top. The debris morphology has a

   clay, sand and peat, aligned parallel to the bluff and arched in the

Abstract = {{The joint acquisition and processing of vertically polarized shear (SV)
   wave seismic reflections and surface waves during a seismic survey were
   carried out in Buckingham (Quebec), near Ottawa, Canada, to characterize
   a thick (20-40 m) sensitive clay deposit. At the study site, the
   outcropping clay unit overlays a 20-50 m thick layer of sand and gravel
   and the bedrock depth reaches more than 90 m along the survey line. The
   seismic reflection survey using common-mid-point (CMP) inversion of
   SV-wave reflections allowed the localization of the clay-sand and
   sand-bedrock interfaces as well as the measurement of SV-wave velocities
   down to the bedrock contact. Velocity variations at depths less than 10
   m could not be assessed due to the early reflections hidden by seismic
   arrivals such as surface waves. However, multi-channel analysis of
   surface waves (MASW) provided the variations in S-wave velocity from the
   surface down to a depth of 12 m at each CMP location. The joint
   acquisition and processing of SV reflections and Rayleigh waves provided
   a more complete and accurate 2D SV velocity model than both methods
   taken separately. To test the accuracy of the proposed approach, a
   multi-offset seismic piezocone penetration test (SCPTu) was performed
   along the survey line from the surface down to a depth of 25 m. The
   vertical variations in seismic velocities in sensitive clay as inferred
   from the SV seismic reflection survey and MASW are comparable to the
   SCPTu S-wave profile.}},

Abstract = {{Through detailed case studies from the literature it is suggested that a
   sensitive clay spread is formed by propagation of a failure surface in
   an intact slope and dislocation of the soil mass in horsts and grabens.
   It is proposed that the initiation and propagation of the failure
   surface can be explained by progressive failure mechanism. According to
   this failure mechanism, failure is initiated near the toe of the slope
   and the strain-softening stress-strain behaviour of sensitive clays is
   used to redistribute shear stress along the quasi-horizontal shear zone.
   The failure propagates inside the deposit reducing the horizontal
   stress. Active strength of the soil may be mobilised, explaining the
   dislocation of the soil mass above the shear zone in horsts and grabens.
   A numerical procedure is used to back calculate the 1994 spread at
   Sainte-Monique, Quebec, Canada, involving slightly over-consolidated
   sensitive clay. The initiation and extent of the failure surface
   observed on site are explained by a soil having large brittleness during
   shear and large-deformation shear strength close to the remoulded shear
   strength of the soil.}},

Title = {{Flow Cytometry Assessment of In Vitro Generated CD138(+) Human Plasma
   Cells}},
Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{The in vitro CD40-CD154 interaction promotes human B lymphocytes
   differentiation into plasma cells. Currently, CD138 is the hallmark
   marker enabling the detection of human plasma cells, both in vitro and
   in vivo; its presence can be monitored by flow cytometry using a
   specific antibody. We have developed a culture system allowing for the
   differentiation of memory B lymphocytes. In order to detect the newly
   formed plasma cells, we have compared their staining using five
   anti-CD138 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). As a reference, we also tested
   human cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and bone marrow
   samples. The five anti-CD138 mAbs stained RPMI-8226 cells (>98\%) with
   variable stain index (SI). The highest SI was obtained with B-A38mAb
   while the lowest SI was obtained with DL-101 and 1D4 mAbs. However, the
   anti-CD138 mAbs were not showing equivalent CD138(+) cells frequencies
   within the generated plasma cells. B-A38, B-B4, and MI-15 were similar
   (15-25\%) while DL-101 mAb stained a higher proportion of CD138-positive
   cells (38-42\%). DL-101 and B-A38 mAbs stained similar populations in
   bone marrow samples but differed in their capacity to bind to
   CD138(high) and CD138(lo) cell lines. In conclusion, such cellular
   fluctuations suggest heterogeneity in human plasma cell populations
   and/or in CD138 molecules.}},

Title = {{Balancing effluent quality, economic cost and greenhouse gas emissions
   during the evaluation of (plant-wide) control/operational strategies in

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper was to show the potential additional insight
   that result from adding greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to plant
   performance evaluation criteria, such as effluent quality (EQI) and
   operational cost (OCI) indices, when evaluating (plant-wide)
   control/operational strategies in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs).
   The proposed GHG evaluation is based on a set of comprehensive dynamic
   models that estimate the most significant potential on-site and off-site
   sources of CO2, CH4 and N2O. The study calculates and discusses the
   changes in EQI, OCI and the emission of GHGs as a consequence of varying
   the following four process variables; (i) the set point of aeration
   control in the activated sludge section; (ii) the removal efficiency of
   total suspended solids (TSS) in the primary clarifier; (iii) the
   temperature in the anaerobic digester; and (iv) the control of the flow
   of anaerobic digester supernatants coming from sludge treatment. Based
   upon the assumptions built into the model structures, simulation results
   highlight the potential undesirable effects of increased GHG production
   when carrying out local energy optimization of the aeration system in
   the activated sludge section and energy recovery from the AD. Although
   off-site CO2 emissions may decrease, the effect is counterbalanced by
   increased N2O emissions, especially since N2O has a 300-fold stronger
   greenhouse effect than CO2. The reported results emphasize the
   importance and usefulness of using multiple evaluation criteria to
   compare and evaluate (plant-wide) control strategies in a WWTP for more
   informed operational decision making. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Since the introduction of column flotation in mineral processing plants

Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{879-890}},

Abstract = {{The long-term patency rates of vascular grafts and stents are limited by
   the lack of surface endothelialisation of the implanted materials. We
   have previously reported that GRGDS and WQPPRARI peptide micropatterns
   increase the endothelialisation of prosthetic materials in vitro. To
   investigate the mechanisms by which the peptide micropatterns affect
   endothelial cell adhesion and proliferation, a TAMRA fluorophore-tagged
   RGD peptide was designed. Live cell imaging revealed that the
   micropattemed surfaces led to directional cell spreading dependent on
   the location of the RGD-TAMRA spots. Focal adhesions formed within 3 h
   on the micropatterned surfaces near RGD-TAMRA spot edges, as expected
   for cell regions experiencing high tension. Similar levels of focal
   adhesion kinase phosphorylation were observed after 3 h on the
   micropatterned surfaces and on surfaces treated with RGD-TAMRA alone,
   suggesting that partial RGD surface coverage is sufficient to elicit
   integrin signaling. Lastly, endothelial cell expansion was achieved in
   serum-free conditions on gelatin-coated, RGD-TAMRA treated or
   micropatterned surfaces. These results show that these peptide
   micropattems mainly impacted cell adhesion kinetics rather than cell
   proliferation. This insight will be useful for the optimization of
   micropatterning strategies to improve vascular biomaterials. Crown

Abstract = {{The oxygen isotope composition of 169 whole-rock samples from the
   world-class LaRonde Penna Au-rich volcanogenic massive sulfide deposit
   range from 6.5 to 22.0 parts per thousand. Fractional crystallization
   from basalt to rhyolite accounts for a variation of approximately 2
   parts per thousand in primary whole-rock delta O-18 values. The
   remaining variance in whole-rock delta O-18 values found at LaRonde
   Penna must therefore be ascribed to water-rock exchange with
   hydrothermal fluids. The metamorphosed, hydrothermally altered host
   rocks have been subdivided according to mineralogical assemblages, which
   display weak covariance with delta O-18 values and whole-rock
   geochemical alteration indices. Water-rock equilibrium exchange models
   indicate that the high delta O-18 values that characterize the LaRonde
   Penna deposit are compatible with low-temperature (similar to 150
   degrees C) hydrothermal alteration at high water-rock oxygen atomic
   ratios (1-50). Zones of lower delta O-18 values stratigraphically
   beneath the principal ore lens (20 North) indicate local zones of higher
   temperature hydrothermal alteration. The oxygen isotope composition of
   the hydrothermal fluid is estimated to have been similar to 5 parts per
   thousand, as a consequence of inking between seawater (delta O-18
   similar to 0 parts per thousand) and a component of magmatic water
   degassed from the volcanic and intrusive rocks associated with the
   LaRonde Penna deposit.}},

Abstract = {{Simultaneous integration of multifunctional properties from different
   components into a hybrid nanostructure with hierarchical organization is
   attractive to construct new materials sought for diverse useful
   applications. This review highlights recent advances in the fabrication
   of multicomponent organic-conjugated inorganic nanoarchitectures and
   their potential uses in optical sensing and diagnostic tools. The
   similarity of the particle sizes, between inorganic hybrids and
   biomolecules, is the reason they can integrate into new bioconjugated
   nanocomposites. These multifunctional properties enable such materials
   to function as dual diagnostic and therapeutic agents in imaging-guided
   therapy. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-templated replica approaches for
   fabricating DNA-functionalized plasmonic nanoarchitectures are discussed
   to show how incorporation of metal clusters onto helical DNA structures
   occurs. The resulting helix plasmonic assemblies response enhanced
   plasmonic properties and circular dichroism signals to external
   environments, means they can function as highly selective bioprobes.
   Nanocrystal superlattices are prepared by assembling the uniform
   colloids by guiding the external magnetic field and solvent evaporation.
   The highly organized superlattices with long-range ordering exhibit
   optical properties tuned by external stimuli and, consequently they can
   be useful for desirable optical sensors and photoswitchable patterns.
   The efforts discussed in this review are expected to present the
   structural diversity of promising multifunctional nanoarchitectures for
   the design of efficient optical sensing and diagnostic tools.}},

Abstract = {{AimsBacterial community structure and composition of a drinking water
   network were assessed to better understand this ecosystem in relation to
   haloacetic acid (HAA) degradation and to identify new bacterial species
   having HAA degradation capacities.
   Methods and ResultsBiofilm samples were collected from a model system,
   simulating the end of the drinking water distribution network and
   supplied with different concentrations of dichloroacetic and
   trichloroacetic acids at different periods over the course of a year.
   The samples were analysed by culturing, denaturing gradient gel
   electrophoresis (DGGE) and sequencing. Pipe diameter and HAA ratios did
   not impact the bacterial community profiles, but the season had a clear
   influence. Based on DGGE profiles, it appeared that a particular biomass
   has developed during the summer compared with the other seasons. Among
   the bacteria isolated in this study, those from genus Cupriavidus were
   able to degrade dichloroacetic acid. Moreover, these bacteria degrade
   dichloroacetic acid at 18 degrees C but not at 10 degrees C.
   ConclusionsThe microbial diversity evolved throughout the experiment,
   but the bacterial community was distinct during the summer. Results
   obtained on the capacity of Cupriavidus to degrade DCAA only at 18
   degrees C but not at 10 degrees C indicate that water temperature is a
   major element affecting DCAA degradation and confirming observations
   made regarding season influence on HAA degradation in the drinking water
   distribution network.
   Significance and Impact of the StudyThis is the first demonstration of
   the HAA biodegradation capacity of the genus Cupriavidus.}},

Abstract = {{In a non-cooperative context such as military or spectrum surveillance
   application, a passive adversary has to solve the problem of estimating
   the transmitter parameters. In addition, wireless systems cause
   signaling overhead since their transmitter must inform the receiver
   about the chosen bit allocation table or the Forward Error Correction
   (FEC) scheme. In this work, a perception of a smart receiver able to
   blindly estimate a specific transmission context based on an intercepted
   stream is proposed. In particular, a new technique addressing the blind
   recognition of low-density parity-check (LDPC), convolutional, and turbo
   codes' encoding parameters at the receiver is introduced. The proposed
   blind detection for the FEC code technique considers a new iterative
   method based on Gauss-Jordan elimination through a pivoting algorithm
   devoted to the blind estimation of these codes encoding parameters in a

Abstract = {{This paper presents a methodology to analyze the assembly conditions of
   parallel manipulators and compute the maximum pose errors of their
   moving platform, while considering geometric errors, joint clearances,
   link flexibility and joint elasticity. First, the proposed methodology
   consists in determining the zone(s) of the manipulator workspace in
   which the manipulator can be assembled assuming that its links and
   joints are rigid, while taking into account geometric errors and joint
   clearances. Then, the minimum energy required to assemble the
   manipulator in the non-assembly zone(s) is computed, while considering
   link flexibility and joint elasticity. The maximum pose errors of the
   moving-platform are also computed throughout the manipulator workspace.
   Finally, a two-dof spatial parallel manipulator, named IRSbot-2, is used
   as an illustrative example.}},

   CLIC specifications, which require a very precise output voltage
   flat-top as well as fast rise and fall times (3 mu s). The Fast Voltage
   Compensator is integrated in the modulator such that it only has to
   manage the capacitor charger current and a fraction of the charging
   voltage. Consequently, its dimensioning power and cost is minimized.}},

Abstract = {{The current availability of large datasets composed of heterogeneous
   objects stresses the importance of large-scale clustering of mixed
   complex items. Several algorithms have been developed for mixed datasets
   composed of numerical and categorical variables, a well-known algorithm
   being the k-prototypes. This algorithm is efficient for clustering large
   datasets given its linear complexity. However, many fields are handling
   more complex data, for example variable-size sets of categorical values
   mixed with numerical and categorical values, which cannot be processed
   as is by the k-prototypes algorithm. We are proposing a variation of the
   k-prototypes clustering algorithm that can handle these complex
   entities, by using a bag-of-words representation for the multi valued
   categorical variables. We evaluate our approach on a real-world
   application to the clustering of administrative health care databases in
   Quebec, with results illustrating the good performances of our method.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology and orthogonal
   frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be combined to design a
   robust communications scheme with increased spectral efficiency and
   system capacity. To reach high power efficiency, MIMO-OFDM systems are
   equipped with high-power amplifiers (HPA). When it operates near its
   saturation region, the HPA causes nonlinear distortions. Unfortunately,
   the nonlinearity of HPA has a crucial impact on the global system
   performance. In this paper, we focus on the effect of the HPA
   nonlinearity on the space-time block coded (STBC) MIMO-OFDM systems.
   Analytic expression of the average Bit error rate (BER) is delivered
   running under frequency selective channel. We also note an excellent
   agreement between analytic expressions and Monte Carlo simulation
   curves. In addition, this work introduces a new iterative cancelation
   technique for the nonlinearly detected by the receiver. The new proposed
   approach is based on the Bussgang theorem and consists in iterative
   estimation and annulation of the nonlinear distortion caused by the high
   power amplifier of the transmitter.}},

Abstract = {{Being able to automatically segment 3D models into meaningful parts is
   an important goal in 3D shape processing. In this paper, we are
   proposing a fast and easy-to-implement 3D segmentation approach, which
   is based on spectral clustering. For this purpose, we define an improved
   formulation of the similarity matrix which allows our algorithm to
   segment both free-form and CAD (Computer Aided Design) 3D models. In 3D
   space, different shapes, such as planes and cylinders, have different
   surface normal distributions. We defined the similarity of vertices
   based on their normals which can segment a 3D model into its geometric
   features. Results show the effectiveness and robustness of our method in
   segmenting a wide range of 3D models. Even in the case of complex
   models, our method results in meaningful segmentations. We tested our
   segmentation approach on real data segmentation, in the presence of
   noise and also in comparison with other methods which provided good

Abstract = {{Carbon fiber-reinforced poly-phenylene sulfide laminate coupons were
   impacted at low-energy in a drop-tower machine and subsequently fatigued
   in a four-point bending fixture. The doubly damaged test pieces were
   then hot-press reconsolidated and inspected nondestructively by
   vibrothermography to check their structural integrity. The residual
   mechanical properties of the laminate in both the as-damaged and
   as-repaired conditions were determined by compression loading with the
   in-plane strain fields determined via a digital image correlation
   system. Cross-section views of damaged and repaired samples were
   analyzed by light optical microscopy and correlated to residual
   mechanical properties, as were the digital image correlation and
   nondestructive test results. Based on the values of stiffness and
   ultimate strength of the repaired laminates, 10 J was inferred as the
   maximum impact energy at which it is worthwhile performing hot-press
   reconsolidation, in view of the applied fatigue history following

Abstract = {{Repair and strengthening of existing concrete structures are among the
   biggest challenges civil engineers are facing today and will have to
   face in the years to come. Present concerns of sustainable development
   emphasizing repair instead of new construction will only strengthen this
   trend. Concerted efforts towards improving the durability of concrete
   repairs are still needed from scientists and engineers. One of the
   critical aspects of durability of concrete repairs and overlays is
   lasting and sufficient interfacial bond between repair material and
   existing concrete substrate. This paper summarizes some of the findings
   of a collaborative study devoted to the most significant factors
   influencing bond in repairs (roughness, degree of saturation and
   carbonation of the substrate) and its field evaluation (type of loading,
   device misalignment). Based on the test results collected in different
   test programs, guideline-type recommendations for surface preparation
   prior to repair were issued.}},

Abstract = {{Repair of any concrete structure results in formation of complex, at
   least two-component repair systems. Compatibility approach is treated as
   a basic requirement during selection of repair material. Recently, the
   understanding for compatibility requirements in repair systems approach
   has been demonstrated in many papers. The aim of this paper is analyzing
   the compatibility between repair materials and the concrete substrate in
   the case of patch repair. The compatibility issues were discussed in the
   light of the various requirements which determine the mathematical space
   of loads, including chemical, mechanical and other physical (mainly
   thermal) loads. N-dimensional compatibility space is created, taking
   into account selected patch material control parameters. The
   requirements for good compatibility between repair material and concrete
   substrate can be formulated by using mathematical inequalities, where
   the variables are the material control parameters. The effects of
   properties of the both repair material and concrete substrate were
   analyzed using the computer system ANCOMP developed at Warsaw University
   of Technology. Usability of this approach was demonstrated using a
   selected case study as an example.}},

   and the pull-off test, to evaluate superficial mechanical integrity of a
   prepared substrate. Although it does not yield a precise evaluation of
   compressive strength, the rebound hammer test is recognized as a useful
   tool for performing quick surveys to assess concrete uniformity. The
   pull-off test is very well correlated with the splitting-tensile test,
   but it is not suited for vertical and overhead surfaces. It appears from
   the results generated in this study that the combination rebound hammer
   / pull-off test could very well fill the needs for the evaluation of

Abstract = {{The ability of sulfide mine tailing (SMT) treated with alkaline
   materials to buffer or neutralize anthropogenic acidity depends on
   several factors including the amount and types of acid-neutralizing
   compounds present in SMT matrix. The main objective of this laboratory
   experiment is to assess the acid buffering capacity of SMT samples after
   their stabilization with chicken eggshell residue (CES), commercial
   cement rich in calcareous products (CCM), dolomitic limestone (DOL),
   calcitic limestone (CAL) and magnesium oxide (MGO). The treatments were
   as follows: SMT without alkaline materials (AM); 2\% CCM; 4\% CCM; 10\%
   CCM; 2\% MGO; 2\% DOL; 2\% CAL; 2\% CES; 4\% CES; 10\% CES; 10\% CES +
   2\% CCM; 10\% CES + 2\% DOL; 10\% CES + 2\% CAL; 10\% CES + 2\% MGO. Two
   days after the addition of 0.5 ml of 0.05 mol/l sulfuric acid, the
   decrease in pH ranged over several orders of magnitude in SMT treated
   with CES and CAL. In general, the lowest values of pH were recorded in
   SMT amended with 2\% and 4\% CES (pH 3.3 and 3.5 respectively) and 2\%
   CAL (pH 3.9). The pH of all acidified aqueous SMT samples increased
   gradually over time. Chicken eggshell residue mixed with MgO or cement
   was considerably more efficient in neutralizing sulfuric acid than CES
   alone. At the end of the equilibration period (56 days), the pH values
   of aqueous SMT+ 2\% AM suspensions (solid: liquid ratio of 1: 20, w/v)
   increased in the following order: SMT + 2\% MGO (pH 9.0) > SMT + 2\% CCM
   (pH 8.6) > SMT + 2\% limestone (CAL or DOL) (pH 7.3 - 7.5) > SMT + 2\%
   CES (pH 7.0). The study showed that sulfide mine tailing treated with
   magnesium oxide or cement was stable and well buffered to acidifying
   input. The results suggested that magnesium compounds and calcareous
   products rich in hydroxides, oxides and carbonates present in limed SMT
   would provide long-term protection against acid deposition or
   re-acidification of limed SMT.}},

Abstract = {{Liming is a prerequisite for sustainable stabilization and
   neutralization of acid producing sulphide mine tailings. Lime is a
   compound of calcium or calcium and magnesium capable of neutralizing
   acid compounds in the soil. A laboratory experiment was conducted to
   investigate the possibility of utilizing chicken eggshells alone or
   mixed with five alkaline materials as a liming material on acidic
   sulphide mine tailing (SMT). Samples of air-dried SMT (pH 3.3) were
   treated with chicken eggshells (CES) alone or in combination with
   concrete residue rich in calcareous products (Portland cement) (CCM),
   dolomitic limestone (DOL), calcitic limestone (CAL) and magnesium oxide
   (MGO). The treatments were as follows: SMT without neutralizing agents;
   1, 2, 4, 8 and 10\% CES alone or in combination with 1 and 2\% CCM, 1
   and 2\% MGO, 1 and 2\% DOL or 1 and 2\% CAL; 1, 2, 4, 8 and 10\% CCM; 1
   and 2\% CAL; 1 and 2\% DOL; 1 and 2\% MGO. Acid tailing neutralization
   experiment was carried out by mixing 10.0 g of treated tailing samples
   with 25 ml of double distilled water. The tailing suspensions were
   allowed to equilibrate for 70 d at room temperature with occasional
   shaking. Tailing suspension pH (pH(TS)) was measured after 1 h, 7 d, 14
   d, 21 d, 35 d, 56 d, and 70 d. Each treatment was replicated two times.
   Application of the highest rate of CES (10\%) alone increased pH(TS)
   from 2.61 (control) to 7.24 in 70 days. However, when adding 2\% of
   cement or 2\% MGO to the CES-amended tailing, pHTS values increased from
   7.24 (10\% CES) to 8.78 or 8.54, respectively. The increase in pHTS was
   generally greater for tailing samples receiving CCM alone (pH
   8.35-11.52). The lowest pHTS was obtained with CES-treated tailings
   (7.18-7.24). CES mixed with CCM or MGO are more efficient in maintaining
   alkaline conditions (pH(TS) > 8) in the tailing than CES + CAL or CES +
   DOL, due probably to the higher neutralizing capacity of magnesium oxide
   and cement. Aluminum, copper, iron, manganese and zinc were not detected
   in aqueous suspensions of treated-tailing samples, due probably to their
   chemical precipitation. These results may have practical implications in
   tailing management for the reduction of acid generation and trace metal
   mobility in sulphide mine drainage system and of water contamination
   risk. Alternative liming materials such as cement and magnesium oxide
   mixed with eggshells may be used as a calcitic amendment to neutralize
   acid-producing mine tailings.}},

   planar body suspended from two cables. First, the conditions for static
   equilibrium are stated and a mathematical formulation of the problem is
   derived. A twelfth degree univariate polynomial is then obtained using
   the resultant of two intermediate polynomials. It is shown that up to
   twelve real solutions can be obtained, thereby confirming that the
   polynomial is of minimal degree. Since the condition used in the
   derivation is necessary but not sufficient, the roots must be tested a
   posteriori for validity. Simple mathematical conditions are provided
   that allow such a verification. Finally, two examples are provided to
   illustrate the results and highlight the importance of the proposed root
   validation procedure.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a trajectory planning technique for planar
   three-degree-of-freedom cable-suspended parallel robots. Based on the
   kinematic and dynamic modelling of the architecture, force constraints
   that can guarantee that cables remain under tension are obtained.
   Periodic parametric trajectories that extend beyond the static workspace
   are designed. The trajectories involve combined translations and
   rotations. Substituting the trajectories into the force constraints,
   interval arithmetics is used to search for global conditions on the
   trajectory parameters which ensure that the trajectories are feasible.
   Special frequencies related to combined rotational and translational
   motions are exposed which can be used to better exploit cable-suspended
   robots. Moreover, it is observed that the special frequencies related to
   the translation are akin to the natural frequency of pendulum-like
   systems. The proposed trajectory planning approach can be used to plan
   combined rotational and translational dynamic trajectories that can
   extend beyond the static workspace of the mechanism, thereby opening
   novel applications and possibilities for cable -suspended robots.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a polynomial solution to the inverse kinematic
   problem of the 6R serial Jaco robot. The solution is specifically
   tailored to the Jaco robot, which is not wrist partitioned. The
   derivation of the univariate 16-degree polynomial is presented, starting
   from the direct kinematic equations providing the position and
   orientation of the end-effector as a function of the joint variables.
   Upon calculation of the roots of the polynomial, all joint variables are
   obtained by backsubstitution, leading to a unique set of joint variables
   for each of the roots. Also, it is shown that for certain
   configurations, the 16-degree polynomial contains only terms of even
   powers while all terms are not zero in general. Two numerical examples
   are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution process.}},

Abstract = {{Hyphenation of biomass torrefaction to chemical looping combustion (CLC)
   was studied experimentally. The concept consists of burning the
   torrefaction volatiles using iron oxide as solid oxygen carrier whereby
   the CLC flue gas, mostly non-diluted CO2 and steam, is recirculated to
   the torrefaction reactor for heat integration. Also, being deprived of
   nitrogen and oxygen, the CLC flue gas allows pure CO2 to be recovered
   and further captured or sequestered thus setting a frame for a negative
   net CO2 torrefaction in co-firing plants to reduce greenhouse gas
   emissions. Birch wood was torrefied between 260 and 300 degrees C and
   the resulting volatiles were burned over iron oxide solid oxygen
   carriers between 400 and 600 degrees C converting up to 99\% of volatile
   carbon into CO2. Oxygen carrier stability for burning torrefaction
   volatiles and oxygen depletion during CLC were assessed vis-a-vis
   deactivation, and CO and hydrogen production. Also, the buildup of CO2
   and water vapor in the recirculating torrefaction gas and their
   incidence on the properties of torrefied solid product were quantified
   in terms of mass and energy yields, equilibrium moisture content and
   grindability of the torrefied birch wood. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

   preventive and corrective maintenance costs, setup costs, holding costs,
   backorder costs, and production costs, while satisfying the demand for
   all products over the entire horizon. The model is first solved by
   comparing the results of several multi-products capacitated lot-sizing
   problems. Then, for large-size problems, a simulated annealing algorithm

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{115}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A novel combination of biomass torrefaction and CO2 sequestration was
   explored in which carbonation of mining residues was conducted near
   ambient temperatures. We report that CO2 as one of the main gases
   evolved during torrefaction of lignocellulosic biomass can be trapped
   using cheap, abundant and already size-reduced mining residues resulting
   in a carbon-negative torrefaction process. Functionalities of
   torrefaction as a prerequisite step for an efficient biomass/coal
   co-firing could thus be further enhanced by curbing the overall process
   CO2 emissions. To test this concept, two different Mg-rich ultramafic
   mining wastes were loaded in a carbonation reactor hyphenated downstream
   of a torrefaction reactor and operated under total gas reflux to capture
   the incipient CO2. The torrefaction unit was operated with birch wood
   according to conventional dry torrefaction as well as using
   ionic-liquid-impregnated torrefaction to increase birch wood
   constituents' torrefaction rate. The effect of some important parameters
   such as carbonation temperature, residue pore water saturation, and
   carbon monoxide and methane concentrations on mining residues CO2 uptake
   was studied systematically to assess if such a tandem concept would
   enable displacement and storage of sizeable amounts of CO2 emitted by
   torrefaction. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   12) \& 18: 2 (6, 9) were more abundant in cells growing at 4 or 10
   degrees C, than in cells cultivated at 21 degrees C. The
   mono-unsaturated phospho/neutral fatty acids myristoleic acid 14:1(11)
   were the most significantly overexpressed (45-fold) after 1hour of
   exposure to 4 degrees C. As reported in the literature, these fatty
   acids play important roles in cold adaptability by supplying cell
   membrane fluidity, and by providing energy to cells. Analysis of
   water-soluble compounds revealed that isobutyrate, sarcosine, threonine
   and valine were more accumulated during exposure to 4 degrees C. These
   metabolites might play a role in conferring cold acclimation to strain
   N-33 at 4 degrees C, probably by acting as cryoprotectants. Isobutyrate
   was highly upregulated (19.4-fold) during growth at 4 degrees C, thus
   suggesting that this compound is a precursor for the cold-regulated
   fatty acids modification to low temperature adaptation.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effect of various plasma parameters (relative
   density of atomic N and H, plasma temperature, and vibrational
   temperature) and process conditions (pressure and H-2/(N-2 + H-2) ratio)
   on the chemical composition of modified poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
   (PTFE). The plasma parameters were measured by means of near-infrared
   (NIR) and UV-visible emission spectroscopy with and without actinometry.
   The process conditions of the N-2-H-2 microwave discharges were set at
   various pressures ranging from 100 to 2000 mTorr and H-2/(N-2+H-2) gas
   mixture ratios between 0 and 0.4. The surface chemical composition of
   the modified polymers was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   (XPS). A mathematical model was constructed using the partial
   least-squares regression algorithm to correlate the plasma information
   (process condition and plasma parameters as determined by emission
   spectroscopy) with the modified surface characteristics. To construct
   the model, a set of data input variables containing process conditions
   and plasma parameters were generated, as well as a response matrix
   containing the surface composition of the polymer. This model was used
   to predict the composition of PTFE surfaces subjected to N-2-H-2 plasma
   treatment. Contrary to what is generally accepted in the literature, the
   present data demonstrate that hydrogen is not directly involved in the
   defluorination of the surface but rather produces atomic nitrogen and/or
   NH radicals that are shown to be at the origin of fluorine atom removal
   from the polymer surface. The results show that process conditions alone
   do not suffice in predicting the surface chemical composition and that
   the plasma characteristics, which cannot be easily correlated with these
   conditions, should be considered. Process optimization and control would
   benefit from plasma diagnostics, particularly infrared emission
   spectroscopy.}},

Title = {{Exploiting Peptide Nanostructures To Construct Functional Artificial Ion
   Channels}},

Abstract = {{Natural ion channel proteins possess remarkable properties that
   researchers could exploit to I I develop nanochemotherapeutics and
   diagnostic devices. Unfortunately, the poor stability, limited
   availability, and complexity of these structures have precluded their
   use in practical devices. One solution to these limitations is to
   develop simpler molecular systems through chemical synthesis that mimic
   the salient properties of artificial ion channels.
   Inspired by natural channel proteins, our group has developed a family
   of peptide nanostructures thatcreate channels for ions by aligning crown
   ethers on top of each other when they adopt an alpha-helical
   conformation. Advantages to this crown ether/peptide framework approach
   include the ease of synthesis, the predictability of their
   conformations, and the ability to fine-tune and engineer their
   properties.
   We have synthesized these structures using solid phase methods from
   artificial crown ether amino adds made from L-DOPA. Circular dichroism
   and FTIR spectroscopy studies in different media confirmed that the
   nanostructures adopt the predicted alpha-helical conformation.
   Fluorescence studies verified the crown ether stacking arrangement. We
   confirmed the channel activity by single-channel measurements using a
   modified patch-clamp technique, planar lipid bilayer (PLB) assays, and
   various vesicle experiments. From the results, we estimate that a 6
   angstrom distance between two relays is ideal for sodium cation
   transport, but relatively efficient ion transport can still occur with
   an 11 angstrom distance between two crown ethers. Biophysical studies
   demonstrated that peptide channels operate as monomers in an equilibrium
   between adsorption at the surface and an active, transmembrane
   orientation.
   Toward practical applications of these systems, we have prepared channel
   analogs that bear a biotin moiety, and we have used them as
   nanotransducers successfully to detect avidin. Analogs of channel
   peptide nanostructures showed cytotoxicity against breast and leukemia
   cancer cells.
   Overall, we have prepared well-defined nanostructures with designed
   properties, demonstrated their transport abilities, and described their
   mechanism of action. We have also illustrated the advantages and the
   versatility of polypeptides for the construction of functional nanoscale
   artificial ion channels.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{1 kHz, 2 mJ, 45 fs, 800 nm laser pulses were fired into a laboratory
   diffusion cloud chamber through a subsaturated zone (relative humidity
   similar to 73\%, T similar to 4.3 degrees C). After 60 min of laser
   irradiation, an oval-shaped snow pile was observed right below the
   filament center and weighed similar to 12.0 mg. The air current velocity
   at the edge of the vortices was estimated to be similar to 16.5 cm/s.
   Scattering scenes recorded from the side show that filament-induced
   turbulence were formed inside the cloud chamber with two vortices below
   the filament. Two-dimensional simulations of the air flow motion in two
   cross sections of the cloud chamber confirm that the turbulent vortices
   exist below the filament. Based upon this simulation, we deduce that the
   vortices indeed have a three-dimensional elliptical shape. Hence, we
   propose that inside vortices where the humidity was supersaturated or
   saturated the condensation nuclei, namely, HNO3, N-2+, O-2+ and other
   aerosols and impurities, were activated and grew in size. Large-sized
   particles would eventually be spun out along the fast moving direction
   towards the cold plate and formed an oval-shaped snow pile at the end.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the test results of a durability study on a novel
   basalt fiber-reinforced polymer (BFRP) bar-anchor system. The BFRP bars
   were exposed to saline and alkaline solutions for 10 weeks before being
   anchored and tested under static and fatigue loading. Unconditioned
   basalt, glass, and carbon specimens were also tested and served as
   controls. Regardless of the fiber material, all the bar-anchor systems
   withstood their ultimate tensile loading with no sign of slippage or
   premature failure in the anchor zones. Conditioning of the BFRP bars in
   saline and alkaline solutions resulted in 7 and 9\% decreases,
   respectively, in the systems' tensile capacity. A decrease of 11\% in
   the modulus of the alkali-conditioned BFRP specimens was also observed.
   The fatigue test results showed that the fatigue life of the bar-anchor
   system was primarily affected by the applied stress range. In addition,
   continuous immersion of the BFRP bar in the alkaline solution increased
   its tendency to fracture prematurely in the anchor zone. The fatigue
   limit of the BFRP bar-anchor system was determined to be 4\% of its
   ultimate capacity, compared with 3 and 10\% for the glass and carbon
   systems, respectively. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{A slightly heated turbulent round jet at high Reynolds number (Re-D =
   1.5 x 10(5)) was studied using simultaneous Laser Doppler Velocimetry
   and cold wire thermometry measurements. Seeding material deposit on the
   cold wire was controlled in order to prevent any contamination of the
   temperature measurements. Turbulent momentum and heat fluxes were
   measured in the self-similar region of the jet. Compared to what was
   published in previous studies, a remarkable agreement was obtained
   between the experimental data ((uv) over bar, (v theta) over bar) and
   the prediction inferred from both momentum and enthalpy equations.
   Turbulent viscosity (nu(T)) and diffusivity (alpha(T)) were also
   determined and they agreed very well with the calculated distributions.
   From these quantities, a good estimation of the radial distribution of
   the turbulent Prandtl number (Pr-T) was obtained. These profiles agree
   with the literature value of Pr-T in the bulk of the jet region where it
   can be considered constant and equal to 0.81. However, a tendency to
   decrease to similar to 0.6 near the jet centerline was observed and
   corroborated with other authors. In the external region, Pr-T tend also
   to decrease to a lower value (similar to 0.6). (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {{Dosimetry for gadolinium neutron capture therapy (GdNCT)}},
Journal = {{RADIATION MEASUREMENTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{233-240}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Gadolinium (Gd) neutron capture therapy (GdNCT) is based on
   a neutron capture reaction (NCR) that involves emission of both short
   and long range products. The aim of this study was to investigate both
   the microscopic and macroscopic contributions of the absorbed dose
   involved in GdNCT.
   Methods: Cylindrical containers with diameters 1-30 mm filled with a
   solution of Gd were irradiated with epithermal neutrons. The background
   neutron dose as well as the prompt gamma dose has been calculated and
   measured by means of film dosimetry for the largest cylinder. Monte
   Carlo codes MCNP5(b) and GEANT4 have been utilized for calculation the
   absorbed dose.
   Results and discussion: Results from the film dosimetry are in agreement
   with the calculations for high doses while for low doses the measured
   values are higher than the calculated results. For the largest cylinder,
   the prompt gamma dose from GdNCR neutron is at least five times higher
   than the background dose. For a cell cluster model, in the first 0.1 mm
   the major contribution to the absorbed dose is from IC electrons. If Gd
   atoms were homogeneously distributed in the nuclei of all tumour cells,
   capture events between neutron and Gd atoms close to DNA could kill the
   tumour cells and give cross-fire dose from IC electrons to the cells
   located in the 0.1 mm range.
   Conclusions: For a correct GdNCT dosimetry both microscopic part of the
   dose delivered by short-range low energy electrons and macroscopic part
   delivered by the prompt gamma should be considered. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Purpose: To assess the dosimetric effects of the presence of the
   applicator, air pockets in clinical target volume (CTV) and OARs along
   with tissue heterogeneities using the Monte Carlo (MC) method in high
   dose rate (HDR) gynecologic interstitial brachytherapy with a
   Syed-Neblett template.
   Methods and materials: The CT based dosimetry has been achieved with the
   Geant4 MC toolkit version 9.2. DICOM-RT files of 38 patients were
   imported into our own platform for MC simulations. The dose
   distributions were then compared to those obtained with a conventional
   TG-43 calculation.
   Results: Taking account of heterogeneities has effects of the order of
   1\% on the HDR gynecological dose distributions. However, the exclusion
   of air pockets and applicator from the DVH calculation can lower the CTV
   D-90 and V-100 by as much as 8.7\% and 5.0\% in comparison with TG-43.
   Rectum dosimetric indices can also be lowered by approximately 3\%
   compared with TG-43 for most cases. Differences for urethra and bladder
   are for most cases below 1\%.
   Conclusions: Exclusion of non-biological material such as air pockets
   and applicator volume from the CTV is important for both TG-43 and MC
   calculations. It could be easily implemented and automated in treatment
   planning systems without affecting computation times. (C) 2013 Elsevier

   including a theoretical analysis. The concept was then integrated into
   the design of the 3rd generation prototype and then into the 4th
   generation prototype. The improvements between the 3rd and 4th
   generation are included into this paper as well as the results gathered
   for both prototypes under laboratory conditions. It is shown that it is
   possible to detect conditions leading to icing and when icing is
   occurring through an intelligent algorithm based on a projected heat

   karsts, or diapirs, can be eliminated on geological criteria. A single 4
   cm long breccia fragment recovered from the central uplift has numerous
   glassy droplets of fluorapatite composition, assumed to be impact melts,
   and a single quartz grain with planar intersection features thought to
   be shock-induced planar deformation features (PDFs). The absolute age of
   this possible impact structure is unknown, but its geological setting
   indicates that it was formed long after the Mid-Ordovician and before
   regional pre-Quaternary sea-level lowstands. Present results outline the
   need for further examination to confirm an impact origin and to
   precisely date the formation of the structure.}},

Abstract = {{In this study the characteristics and extent of the smear zone are
   investigated using a large, undisturbed sample. The aim of using such a
   sample is to capture the realistic characteristics of the smear zone in
   relation to the in situ soil structure during the installation of
   prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) using a mandrel. The extent of the
   smear zone for Bulli clay (New South Wales, Australia) is determined on
   the basis of normalised permeability (k(h)/k(hu)) and the reduction in
   the water content upon consolidation. The permeability and
   compressibility of the soil are investigated to determine the extent to
   which the soil surrounding the PVD has become disturbed. In laboratory
   testing, the soil consolidation behaviour due to a PVD is studied using
   a large-scale consolidometer apparatus. The numerical results have shown
   that the writers' solutions give excellent agreement with laboratory

Title = {{BROADBAND PULSATIONS FROM PSR B1821-24: IMPLICATIONS FOR EMISSION MODELS
   AND THE PULSAR POPULATION OF M28}},
Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{778}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{We report a 5.4 sigma detection of pulsed gamma rays from PSR B1821-24
   in the globular cluster M28 using similar to 44 months of Fermi Large
   Area Telescope (LAT) data that have been reprocessed with improved
   instrument calibration constants. We constructed a phase-coherent
   ephemeris, with post-fit residual rms of 3 mu s, using radio data
   spanning similar to 23.2 yr, enabling measurements of the
   multi-wavelength light-curve properties of PSR B1821-24 at the
   milliperiod level. We fold RXTE observations of PSR B1821-24 from 1996
   to 2007 and discuss implications on the emission zones. The gamma-ray
   light curve consists of two peaks separated by 0.41 +/- 0.02 in phase,
   with the first gamma-ray peak lagging behind the first radio peak by
   0.05 +/- 0.02 in phase, consistent with the phase of giant radio pulses.
   We observe significant emission in the off-peak interval of PSR B1821-24
   with a best-fit LAT position inconsistent with the core of M28. We do
   not detect significant gamma-ray pulsations at the spin or orbital
   periods from any other known pulsar in M28, and we place limits on the
   number of energetic pulsars in the cluster. The derived gamma-ray
   efficiency, similar to 2\%, is typical of other gamma-ray pulsars with
   comparable spin-down power, suggesting that the measured spin-down rate
   (2.2 x 10(36) erg s(-1)) is not appreciably distorted by acceleration in
   the cluster potential. This confirms PSR B1821-24 as the second very
   energetic millisecond pulsar in a globular cluster and raises the
   question of whether these represent a separate class of objects that
   only form in regions of very high stellar density.}},

Abstract = {{This is a numerical study where we propose and quantify a technique for
   increasing the efficiency of convective systems. The concept is based on
   ``trimming{''} or ``shaving{''} and locally discarding the warmest part
   of a developing thermal boundary layer such that fluid at moderate
   temperatures is always absorbing thermal energy from the heated
   surfaces, which are not allowed to overheat. For the present study, a
   parallel plate channel that is subjected to an internal forced
   convective cooling is the configuration considered. Therefore,
   geometrically speaking, the proposed trimming technique simply consists
   in optimizing a blunt reduction of the spacing between the upper and
   lower plates composing the channel along its axial location, such that
   the new configuration has a step-like geometry, allowing the heated
   coolant to be discarded at the transition between the two sections. The
   numerical results, which are directly compared with the performance of
   an optimally spaced flow between two parallel plates, show that the
   thermal performance can be increased by over 20\% with two levels of
   trimming along the flow axis for forced convection i.e., three sections
   with different plate-to-plate spacings. The numerical predictions are
   also compared with scaling-based results showing a good agreement.
   Additionally, numerical simulations also considered buoyancy driven
   flows (i.e., natural convection); however, no significant performance
   gains were observed when the boundary layer trimming was used in that
   case. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hydroxyapatite (HA) coated implant is more susceptible to bacterial
   infection as the micro-structure surface which is beneficial for
   osseointegration, could also become a reservoir for bacterial
   colonisation. The aim of this study was to introduce the antibacterial
   effect of silver (Ag) to the biomineralised HA by utilising a
   polydopamine film as an intermediate layer for Ag and HA immobilisation.
   Sufficient catechol groups in polydopamine were required to bind
   chemically stainless steel 316 L, Ag and HA elements. Different amounts
   of Ag nanoparticles were metallised on the polydopamine grafted
   stainless steel by varying the immersion time in silver nitrate solution
   from 12 to 24 h. Another polydopamine layer was then formed on the
   metallised film, followed by surface biomineralisation in 1.5 Simulated
   Body Fluid (SBF) solution for 3 days. Several characterisation
   techniques including X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, Atomic Force
   Microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy and Contact Angle showed that
   Ag nanoparticles and HA agglomerations were successfully immobilised on
   the polydopamine film through an element reduction process. The Ag
   metallisation at 24 h has killed the viable bacteria with 97.88\% of
   bactericidal ratio. The Ag was ionised up to 7 days which is crucial to
   prevent bacterial infection during the first stage of implant
   restoration. The aged functionalised films were considered stable due to
   less alteration of its chemical composition, surface roughness and
   wettability properties. The ability of the functionalised film to coat
   complex and micro scale metal make it suitable for dental and
   orthopaedic implants application. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel underactuated anthropomorphic gripper for
   prosthetic applications. In order to extend the grasping capabilities of
   underactuated prosthetic grippers and improve the force transmission
   ratio, a mechanical lever is mounted inside the palm that allows a
   proper distribution of the forces and provides mechanical advantage. A
   static model is developed and the possibilities offered by the lever
   transmission are investigated. Also, a compact mechanism is introduced
   to synchronize the motion of the four fingers. Additionally, a
   mechanical selector is designed that functions as a means of
   mechanically programming the motion of the fingers by selectively
   blocking their closing motion. Finally, a prototype, including all the
   above features, is described and experimental validation is briefly
   reported.}},

Abstract = {{As analysts are expected to process a greater amount of information in a
   shorter amount of time, creators of big data software are challenged
   with the need for improved efficiency. Ray, our group's usable, scalable
   genome assembler, addresses big data problems by using optimal resources
   and producing one, correct and conservative, timely solution. Only by
   abstracting the size of the data from both the computers and the humans
   can the real scientific question, often complex in itself, eventually be
   solved. To draw a curtain over the specific computational machinery of
   big data, we developed RayPlatform, a programming framework that allows
   users to concentrate on their domain-specific problems. RayPlatform is a
   parallel message-passing software framework that runs on clouds,
   supercomputers, and desktops alike. Using established technologies such
   as C++ and MPI (message-passing interface), we handle the genomes of
   hundreds of species, from viruses to plants, using machines ranging from
   desktop computers to supercomputers. From this experience, we present
   insights on making computer time more useful-and user time much more

   (Mangifera Indica)}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Plant ionomes and soil nutrients are commonly diagnosed in agronomy
   using concentration and nutrient ratio ranges. However, both diagnoses
   are biased by redundancy of information, subcompositional incoherence
   and non-normal distribution inherent to compositional data, potentially
   leading to conflicting results and wrong inferences. Our objective was
   to present an unbiased statistical approach of plant nutrient diagnosis
   using a balance concept and mango (Mangifera indica) as test crop. We
   collected foliar samples at flowering stage in 175 mango orchards. The
   ionomes comprised 11 nutrients (S, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, B, Cu, Zn, Mn, Fe).
   Traditional multivariate methods were found to be biased. lonomes were
   thus represented by unbiased balances computed as isometric log ratios
   (ilr). Soil fertility attributes (pH and bioavailable nutrients) were
   transformed into balances to conduct discriminant analysis. The orchards
   differed more from genotype than soil nutrient signatures. A customized
   receiver operating characteristic (ROC) iterative procedure was
   developed to classify tissue ionomes between balanced/misbalanced and
   high/low-yielders. The ROC partitioning procedure showed that the
   critical Mahalanobis distance of 4.08 separating balanced from
   imbalanced specimens about yield cut-off of 128.5 kg fruit tree(-1)
   proved to be a fairly informative test (area under curve = 0.84-0.92).
   The {[}P vertical bar N,S] and {[}Mn vertical bar Cu,Zn] balances were
   found to be potential sources of misbalance in the less productive
   orchards, and should thus be further investigated in field experiments.
   We propose using a coherent pan balance diagnostic method with median
   ilr values of top yielders centered at fulcrums of a mobile and the
   critical Mahalanobis distance as a guide for global nutrient balance.
   Nutrient concentrations in weighing pans assisted appreciating nutrients
   as relative shortage, adequacy or excess in balances.}},

   THE SUBGRID CHEMICAL ENRICHMENT MODEL}},
Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{777}},

Abstract = {{We present a one-zone galactic chemical enrichment model that takes into
   account the contribution of stellar winds from massive stars under the
   effect of rotation, Type II supernovae, hypernovae, stellar winds from
   low- and intermediate-mass stars, and Type Ia supernovae. This
   enrichment model will be implemented in a galactic model designed to be
   used as a subgrid treatment for galaxy evolution and outflow generation
   in large-scale cosmological simulations, in order to study the evolution
   of the intergalactic medium. We test our enrichment prescription by
   comparing its predictions with the metallicity distribution function and
   the abundance patterns of 14 chemical elements observed in the Milky Way
   stars. To do so, we combine the effect of many stellar populations
   created from the star formation history of the Galaxy in the solar
   neighborhood. For each stellar population, we keep track of its specific
   mass, initial metallicity, and age. We follow the time evolution of
   every population in order to respect the time delay between the various
   stellar phases. Our model is able to reproduce the observed abundances
   of C, O, Na, Mg, Al, S, and Ca. For Si, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, and Zn, the fits
   are still reasonable, but improvements are needed. We marginally
   reproduce the nitrogen abundance in very low metallicity stars. Overall,
   our results are consistent with the predicted abundance ratios seen in
   previous studies of the enrichment history of the Milky Way. We have
   demonstrated that our semi-analytic one-zone model, which cannot deal
   with spatial information such as the metallicity gradient, can
   nevertheless successfully reproduce the global Galactic enrichment
   evolution obtained by more complex models, at a fraction of the
   computational cost. This model is therefore suitable for a subgrid
   treatment of chemical enrichment in large-scale cosmological
   simulations.}},

Title = {{Characterization of slip resistance of high strength bolted connections
   with zinc-based metallized faying surfaces}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},

Abstract = {{Bolted connections are designed as slip-critical if they would be
   subjected to fatigue or significant load reversal, typical in steel
   girder bridges. In this type of connection, slip of any magnitude must
   be prevented to eliminate intolerable geometric changes and consequent
   stability problems. The surface condition of the connected steel
   components, also known as the faying surface, controls the level of the
   slip resistance. Design provisions for slip-critical bolted connections
   in contemporary standards, such as the Canadian Highway Bridge Design
   Code CAN/CSA S6-06 and the American Institute of Steel Construction
   (AISC) Specifications, specify desired conditions for faying surfaces
   and associated slip coefficients for design purposes. Currently, these
   standards do not address faying surface conditions that are metallized,
   although steel bridge elements are widely metallized to provide
   long-term protection against wear and corrosion. Steel bridge
   fabricators are thus compelled to mask off all faying surfaces before
   applying the protective coating on the structural elements. This
   practice is highly labor-intensive, costly and time consuming. In this
   paper, the resistance of slip-critical bolted joints with zinc-based
   metallized faying surfaces is characterized in the light of the North
   American design standards. The mean slip coefficients obtained from
   short-duration compression and tension test regimes for different
   connection parameters revealed much greater slip resistance than the
   typical uncoated blast-cleaned Class B faying surface. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{As the cranberry industry implements irrigation automation, thresholding
   based on real-time monitoring of soil moisture to initiate irrigation is
   lacking. This study was conducted to determine the optimum soil water
   potential for starting sprinkler irrigation (SWPI) that would optimize
   water productivity (WP) without decreasing yield. During the 2011 and
   2012 growing seasons, three sites in Quebec and one site in Wisconsin
   were equipped with tensiometers, flowmeters, and weather stations for
   testing wet (-5.5 kPa), dry (-7.0 to -10.0 kPa), and control (-6.0 to
   -6.5 kPa) treatments. The experimental designs were developed to
   evaluate the impact of irrigation treatments on yield and WP Dry
   treatments required 21\% to 93\% less irrigation water than the control
   treatments; wet treatments needed 54\% to 186\% more irrigation water
   than the control treatments. Irrigation treatments had no significant
   effect on yield when SWPI values ranged from - 5.5 to -8.0 kPa; however,
   a significant yield reduction of 11\% was observed for a SWPI value of
   -10.0 kPa. The WP values in dry treatments were always higher than those
   in control and wet treatments. Dry treatments, with SWPI ranging from -
   7.0 to -8.0 kPa, significantly improved the water productivity without
   decreasing yield.}},

Abstract = {{The coordination of reservoir operation is critical for water systems'
   efficiency. Improved coordination requires sharing information,
   demanding a clear understanding of the potential gains and its
   distribution among the users to motivate engagement in coordinated
   operations and bearing of transaction costs. In a multiuser,
   multireservoir system, the evaluation of the potential coordination
   gains is not trivial because it requires the simultaneous evaluation of
   numerous trade offs. This paper presents a methodology to identify the
   likely upper and lower bounds in multireservoir system benefits,
   providing a reference framework for analyzing the economic value of
   coordination. The methodology is applied to a large-scale multireservoir
   system in Brazil. The methods rely on the comparison between two
   management scenarios. The first one mimics typical system operation
   based on individually designed rule curves, which are likely to perform
   on the lower bound. This is compared with fullscale system-wide
   optimization through an Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming algorithm to
   represent fully coordinated reservoir operation (upper bound). For our
   case study, results indicate that better coordination reduced spills and
   improved releases timing according to reservoirs characteristics and
   location, allowing overall gains between 3\% and 8\% in energy and 7.9\%
   in revenues, with revenues mostly improved by coordination in dry years.
   Larger reservoirs presented the highest gains in absolute terms, while
   the smaller ones presented the highest relative increases. By indicating
   individual gains at each reservoir, valuable information is produced to
   support future negotiations and benefit sharing among different agents,
   being water agencies or power companies.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic vibrothermography (UVT), or sonic infrared imaging, is a
   promising technique which excites ultrasonic elastic waves to locally
   stimulate defects on solid specimens and is typically applied in the
   aerospace and automotive industries. This technique allows for defect
   selective imaging using thermal waves generated by ultrasound waves.
   Energy dissipation mechanisms turn a dynamically loaded defect into a
   heat source, which is identified by a thermography system. In this paper
   finite element method (FEM) is implemented for simulation of
   vibrothermography and qualitative study of crack heating caused by
   internal and external energy losses. External loss is modeled by
   considering local friction between crack surfaces and internal loss
   (hysteresis) is modeled by taking into account viscoelastic and
   thermoelastic damping in the absence of plastic deformations. Defected
   plate specimens with edge crack and internal crack subjected to
   ultrasonic waves are modeled and studied. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

   comparison of different methods}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{40-52}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Three global sensitivity analysis (GSA) methods are applied and compared
   to assess the most relevant processes occurring in wastewater treatment
   systems. In particular, the Standardised Regression Coefficients, Morris
   Screening and Extended-FAST methods are applied to a complex integrated
   membrane bioreactor (MBR) model considering 21 model outputs and 79
   model factors. The three methods are applied with numerical settings as
   suggested in literature. The main objective considered is to classify
   important factors (factors prioritisation) as well as non-influential
   factors (factors fixing). The performance is assessed by comparing the
   most reliable method (Extended-FAST), by means of proposed criteria,
   with the two other methods. In particular, similarity to results
   obtained from Extended-FAST is assessed for sensitivity indices, for the
   ranking of sensitivity indices, for the classification into
   important/non-influential factors and for the method's ability to detect
   interaction among factors and to provide results in a reasonable time.
   It was found that the computationally less expensive SRC method was
   applied outside its range of applicability (R-2) = (0.3-0.6) < 0.7.
   Still, the SRC produced a ranking of important factors similar to
   Extended-FAST. For some variables significant interactions among the
   factors were revealed by computing the total effect indices S-Ti using
   Extended-FAST. This means that to obtain reliable variance decomposition
   and to detect and quantify interactions among the factors, the use of
   the Extended-FAST is recommended. Regarding the comparison between
   Morris screening and Extended-FAST a poor agreement was found. In
   particular, the Morris screening overestimated the number of both
   important and non-influential factors compared to Extended-FAST for the
   analysed case study. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an offline frequency-domain nonlinear and stochastic
   identification method for equivalent model parameter estimation of
   high-voltage pulse transformers. Such kinds of transformers are widely
   used in the pulsed-power domain, and the difficulty in deriving
   pulsed-power converter optimal control strategies is directly linked to
   the accuracy of the equivalent circuit parameters. These components
   require models which take into account electric fields energies
   represented by stray capacitance in the equivalent circuit. These
   capacitive elements must be accurately identified, since they greatly
   influence the general converter performances. A nonlinear
   frequency-based identification method, based on maximum-likelihood
   estimation, is presented, and a sensitivity analysis of the best
   experimental test to be considered is carried out. The procedure takes
   into account magnetic saturation and skin effects occurring in the
   windings during the frequency tests. The presented method is validated
   by experimental identification of a 2-MW-100-kV pulse transformer.}},

Abstract = {{This work investigates the effects of different degradation processes
   (weathering, thermal ageing and re-extrusion) on maleated polyethylene
   (MAPE), as well as MAPE/ground tire rubber (GTR) thermoplastic
   elastomers with and without stabilizers (thermal stabilizer, UVA and
   HALS). Mechanical characterizations revealed that GTR addition reduced
   compounds stability against thermal ageing at both 80 and 90 degrees C.
   But addition of stabilizers increased thermal stability of the MAPE
   phase. However, the results suggest that the stabilizers had no effect
   on the GTR phase. Mechanical characterizations also showed that
   weathering caused degradation in MAPE, while presence of stabilizers
   decreased the effects of degradation. Addition of GTR also increased
   significantly the stability of MAPE against weathering (due to presence
   of carbon black in GTR). Re-extrusion resulted in lower MAPE modulus
   (due to decreased molecular weight), while the modulus of GTR filled
   compounds increased. Re-extrusion also led to decreased GTR average
   particle size, especially at higher GTR contents. Morphological analyses
   showed that thermal ageing and re-extrusion did not change significantly
   blend morphology, but weathering, on the other hand, led to severe
   degradation of both MAPE and GTR filled compounds surface. Compression
   set of MAPE/GTR compounds was found to decrease with increasing
   degradation level (due to crosslinking). Finally, sample density
   slightly increased with degradation level (also due to crosslinking).

Abstract = {{Near-infrared (NIR)-to-NIR upconverting NaY(Gd)F-4:Tm3+,Yb3+
   paramagnetic nanoparticles (NPs) are efficiently detected by NIR imaging
   techniques. As they contain Gd3+ ions, they also provide efficient
   positive contrast in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Water-dispersible
   small (approximate to 25 nm, S-) and ultrasmall (<5 nm diam., US-)
   NaY(Gd)F-4:Tm3+,Yb3+ NPs are synthesized by thermal decomposition and
   capped with citrate. The surface of citrate-coated US-NPs shows sodium
   depletion and high Gd elemental ratios, as confirmed by a comparative
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)/neutron absorption analysis
   study. US-NaGd0.745F4:Tm-0.005,Y-b0.25 NPs have hydrodynamic diameters
   close to that measured by TEM, with the lowest relaxometric ratios
   (r(2)/r(1) = 1.18) reported for NaGdF4 nanoparticle suspensions (r(1) =
   3.37 mM(-1) s(-1) at 1.4 T and 37 degrees C). Strong relaxivity peaks in
   the range of 20 (0.47 T) - 300 MHz (7.05 T) are revealed in nuclear
   magnetic resonance dispersion profiles, with high r(2)/r(1) ratios at
   increasing field strengths for S-NPs. This indicates the superiority of
   US-NPs over S-NPs for achieving high positive contrast at clinical MRI
   field strengths. I.-v. injected citrate-coated US-NPs evidence long
   blood retention times (>90 min) in mice. Biodistribution studies (48 h,
   8 d) show elimination through the reticuloendothelial and urinary
   systems, similarly to other citrate-capped US-NP systems. In summary,
   upconverting NaY(Gd)F-4:Tm3+,Yb3+ nanoparticles have promising
   luminescent, relaxometric and blood-retention properties for dual
   MRI/optical imaging.}},

Abstract = {{The buffering capacity (BC) of organic substrates used in agriculture as
   soil amendments or organic fertilizers are of high interest to prevent
   adverse effects of mineral fertilizers in the application band near
   seeds or juvenile seedlings. This is the effect of ammonia, nitrous or
   aluminum toxicity caused by the sudden and temporary pH flux due to the
   application of these fertilizers. However, to our knowledge there is no
   standard method for computing of the BC of organic substrates. In this
   study, a method by integral calculation, called BCI, was developed and
   tested on 30 organic amendments and fertilizers (OAF) commonly used in
   agriculture in Quebec. These OAF were titrated with variable rates of
   diluted H2SO4 or NaOH. A linear and a punctual methods found in the
   literature were compared to BCI. The integral method was found more
   appropriate to OAF titration curves, particularly for determining the
   global BC, integrating the curves obtained during both the acid and
   alkaline treatments, which was not possible with the other two methods
   found in the literature. On average, the potential alkalinity of the 30
   OAF was higher than the total exchangeable acidity. The globol BCI could
   be predicted with total Ca, exchangeable Ca, and total Al (r(2) = 0.79).
   Likewise, the BCI to acidity could be predicted using total Ca,
   exchangeable Ca, and pH(CaCl2) (r(2) =0.78).}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{98}},

Abstract = {{It is common for at least one monitoring well to be located proximally
   to a production well. This presents the possibility of applying
   crosswell technologies to resolve a range of earth properties between
   the wells. We present both field and synthetic examples of dual well
   walk-away vertical seismic profiling in vertical wells and show how the
   direct arrivals from a virtual source may be used to create velocity
   images between the wells. The synthetic experiments highlight the
   potential of virtual source crosswell tomography where large numbers of
   closely spaced receivers can be deployed in multiple wells. The field
   experiment is completed in two monitoring wells at an aquifer storage
   and recovery site near Perth, Western Australia. For this site, the
   crosswell velocity distribution recovered from inversion of travel times
   between in-hole virtual sources and receivers is highly consistent with
   what is expected from sonic logging and detailed zero-offset vertical
   seismic profiling. When compared to conventional walkaway vertical
   seismic profiling, the only additional effort required to complete
   dual-well walkaway vertical seismic profiling is the deployment of
   seismic sensors in the second well. The significant advantage of virtual
   source crosswell tomography is realised where strong near surface
   heterogeneity results in large travel time statics. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {{Adaptation of the CVT algorithm for catheter optimization in high dose
   rate brachytherapy}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: An innovative, simple, and fast method to optimize the number
   and position of catheters is presented for prostate and breast high dose
   rate (HDR) brachytherapy, both for arbitrary templates or template-free
   implants (such as robotic templates).
   Methods: Eight clinical cases were chosen randomly from a bank of
   patients, previously treated in our clinic to test our method. The 2D
   Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations (CVT) algorithm was adapted to
   distribute catheters uniformly in space, within the maximum external
   contour of the planning target volume. The catheters optimization
   procedure includes the inverse planning simulated annealing algorithm
   (IPSA). Complete treatment plans can then be generated from the
   algorithm for different number of catheters. The best plan is chosen
   from different dosimetry criteria and will automatically provide the
   number of catheters and their positions. After the CVT algorithm
   parameters were optimized for speed and dosimetric results, it was
   validated against prostate clinical cases, using clinically relevant
   dose parameters. The robustness to implantation error was also
   evaluated. Finally, the efficiency of the method was tested in breast
   interstitial HDR brachytherapy cases.
   Results: The effect of the number and locations of the catheters on
   prostate cancer patients was studied. Treatment plans with a better or
   equivalent dose distributions could be obtained with fewer catheters. A
   better or equal prostate V100 was obtained down to 12 catheters. Plans
   with nine or less catheters would not be clinically acceptable in terms
   of prostate V100 and D90. Implantation errors up to 3 mm were acceptable
   since no statistical difference was found when compared to 0 mm error (p
   > 0.05). No significant difference in dosimetric indices was observed
   for the different combination of parameters within the CVT algorithm. A
   linear relation was found between the number of random points and the
   optimization time of the CVT algorithm. Because the computation time
   decrease with the number of points and that no effects were observed on
   the dosimetric indices when varying the number of sampling points and
   the number of iterations, they were respectively fixed to 2500 and to
   100. The computation time to obtain ten complete treatments plans
   ranging from 9 to 18 catheters, with the corresponding dosimetric
   indices, was 90 s. However, 93\% of the computation time is used by a
   research version of IPSA. For the breast, on average, the Radiation
   Therapy Oncology Group recommendations would be satisfied down to 12
   catheters. Plans with nine or less catheters would not be clinically
   acceptable in terms of V100, dose homogeneity index, and D90.
   Conclusions: The authors have devised a simple, fast and efficient
   method to optimize the number and position of catheters in interstitial
   HDR brachytherapy. The method was shown to be robust for both prostate
   and breast HDR brachytherapy. More importantly, the computation time of
   the algorithm is acceptable for clinical use. Ultimately, this catheter
   optimization algorithm could be coupled with a 3D ultrasound system to
   allow real-time guidance and planning in HDR brachytherapy. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{In arid zones, the use of compost for plant production in forest
   nurseries is hindered by a lack of water. The main objectives of this
   study were (1) to evaluate the physical stability of composts produced
   from shredded branches of Acacia cyanophylla and A. cyclops subjected to
   a repeated drying and wetting cycles, similar to those used at the
   operational scale in nurseries in arid regions and to compare these
   composts with a standard peat-vermiculite (PV) substrate; (2) to
   identify the relevant substrate physical variables that correlate with
   seedling growth. Carob (Ceratonia siliqua L.) was cultivated during a
   production cycle of 27 weeks in a completely randomized block
   experiment. Substrate physical variables were measured at the beginning,
   middle and end of the experiment. Seedling growth variables were
   evaluated over the course of the production cycle, while gas exchange
   and water-relation variables were measured during a wetting and drying
   cycle at the end of the experiment. All three substrates produced
   vigorous seedlings with well-developed root systems that colonized the
   entire root plug. The growth of seedlings produced in the PV substrate
   was better than those grown in the compost-based substrates. No
   significant differences in gas exchange capacities and water relation
   variables were observed among the three substrates at the end of
   experiment with the exception of net photosynthesis, which was higher
   for the PV substrate at high substrate matric potential. Excessive
   drainage was negatively correlated with growth variables while water
   availability in the early growth phase and air porosity towards the end
   of experiment were positively correlated. Performance of the two
   composts could be increased by improving their initial structure and
   stability and by adjusting the irrigation regime.}},

Abstract = {{Biodegradable stents are considered to be a recent innovation, and their
   feasibility and applicability have been proven in recent years. Research
   in this area has focused on materials development and biological
   studies, rather than on how to transform the developed biodegradable
   materials into the stent itself. Currently available stent technology,
   the laser cutting-based process, might be adapted to fabricate
   biodegradable stents. In this work, the fabrication, characterization
   and testing of biodegradable Fe-Mn stents are described. A standard
   process for fabricating and testing stainless steel 316L stents was
   referred to. The influence of process parameters on the physical,
   metallurgical and mechanical properties of the stents, and the quality
   of the produced stents, were investigated. It was found that some steps
   of the standard process such as laser cutting can be directly applied,
   but changes to parameters are needed for annealing, and alternatives are
   needed to replace electropolishing. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{Biodegradable magnesium alloy stents (MAS) could present improved
   long-term clinical performances over commercial bare metal or
   drug-eluting stents. However, MAS were found to show limited mechanical
   support for diseased vessels due to fast degradation. Optimizing stent
   design through finite element analysis (FEA) is an efficient way to
   improve such properties. Following previous FEA works on design
   optimization and degradation modeling of MAS, this work carried out an
   experimental validation for the developed FEA model, thus proving its
   practical applicability of simulating MAS degradation. Twelve stent
   samples of AZ31B were manufactured according to two MAS designs (an
   optimized one and a conventional one), with six samples of each design.
   All the samples were balloon expanded and subsequently immersed in
   D-Hanks' solution for a degradation test lasting 14 days. The
   experimental results showed that the samples of the optimized design had
   better corrosion resistance than those of the conventional design.
   Furthermore, the degradation process of the samples was dominated by
   uniform and stress corrosion. With the good match between the simulation
   and the experimental results, the work shows that the FEA numerical
   modeling constitutes an effective tool for design and thus the
   improvement of novel biodegradable MAS. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{Iron-based materials could constitute an interesting option for
   cardiovascular biodegradable stent applications due to their superior
   ductility compared to their counterparts - magnesium alloys. Since the
   predicted degradation rate of pure iron is considered slow, manganese
   (35\% w/w), an alloying element for iron, was explored to counteract
   this problem through the powder metallurgy process (Fe-35 Mn). However,
   manganese presents a high cytotoxic potential; thus its effect on cells
   must first be established. Here, we established the gene expression
   profile of mouse 3T3 fibroblasts exposed to Fe-35 Mn degradation
   products in order to better understand cell response to potentially
   cytotoxic degradable metallic material (DMM). Mouse 3T3 cells were
   exposed to degradation products eluting through tissue culture insert
   filter (3 mu m pore size) containing cytostatic amounts of 3.25 mg
   ml(-1) of Fe-35 Mn powder, 0.25 mg ml(-1) of pure Mn powder or 5 mg
   ml(-1) of pure iron powder for 24 h. We then conducted a gene expression
   profiling study from these cells. Exposure of 3T3 cells to Fe-35 Mn was
   associated with the up-regulation of 75 genes and down-regulation of 59
   genes, while 126 were up-regulated and 76 down-regulated genes in the
   presence of manganese. No genes were found regulated for the iron
   powder. When comparing the GEP of 3T3 fibroblasts in the presence of
   Fe-35 Mn and Mn, 68 up-regulated and 54 down-regulated genes were
   common. These results were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR for a subset
   of these genes. This GEP study could provide clues about the mechanism
   behind degradation products effects on cells of the Fe-35 Mn alloy and
   may help in the appraisal of its potential for DMM applications. (C)

Abstract = {{Iron-based materials could constitute an interesting option for
   cardiovascular biodegradable stent applications due to their appropriate
   ductility compared with their counterparts, magnesium alloys. However,
   the predicted degradation rate of pure iron is considered to be too slow
   for such applications. We explored manganese (35 wt.\%) as an alloying
   element in combination with iron to circumvent this problem through
   powder metallurgical processing (Fe-35Mn). Manganese, on the other hand,
   is highly cytotoxic. We recently explored a new method to better
   characterize the safety of degradable metallic materials (DMMs) by
   establishing the gene expression profile (GEP) of cells (mouse 313
   fibroblasts) exposed to Fe-35Mn degradation products in order to better
   understand their global response to a potentially cytotoxic DMM. We
   identified a number of up- and down-regulated genes and confirmed the
   regulation of a subset of them by quantitative real time polymerase
   chain reaction. Caveolin-1 (cav1), the structural protein of caveolae,
   small, smooth plasma membrane invaginations present in various
   differentiated cell types, was one of the most down-regulated genes in
   our GEPs. In the present study we further studied the potential of this
   22 kDa protein to become a biomarker for cytotoxicity after exposure to
   degradable metallic elements. In order to better characterize cav1
   expression in this context 313 mouse fibroblasts were exposed to either
   ferrous and manganese ions at cytostatic concentrations for 24 or 48 h.
   cav1 gene expression was not influenced by exposure to ferrous ions. On
   the other hand, exposure to manganese for 24 h reduced cav1 gene
   expression by about 30\% and by >65\% after 48 h compared with control
   3T3 cells. The cav1 cellular protein content was reduced to the same
   extent. The same pattern of expression of cav3 (the muscle-specific
   caveolin subtype) was also observed in this study. This strong and
   reproducible pattern of regulation of caveolins thus indicates potential
   as a biomarker for the toxicity of DMM elements. (C) 2013 Acta

Abstract = {{Purpose : To assess the impact of environmentally relevant levels of
   ingested Ra-226 on a common freshwater fish species.
   Methods : Fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas, Rafinesque) were obtained
   at the first feeding stage and established on a commercial fish food
   diet containing Ra-226 in the activity range 10 mBq/g(-1), -10,000
   mBq/g(-1). They remained on this diet for 24 months and were sampled
   invasively at 1,6,18 and 24 months to assess growth, biochemical indices
   and accumulated dose and non-invasively also at 12 and 15 months to
   assess growth.
   Results : Fish fed 10 and 100 mBq/g(-1) diet showed a small transitory
   deregulation of growth at 6 and 12 months. Fish fed higher activities
   showed less significant or insignificant effects. There was a trend at
   18 months which was stronger at 24 months for the population
   distribution to change in all of the Ra-226 fed groups so that smaller
   fish were smaller and bigger fish were bigger than the controls. There
   were also significant differences in the ratios of protein: DNA at 24
   months which were seen as a trend but were not significant at earlier
   time points.
   Conclusions : Fish fed a radium diet for 2 years show a small and
   transitory growth dysregulation at 6 and 12 months. The effects
   predominate at the lower activities suggesting hormetic or homeostatic
   adjustments. There was no effect on growth of exposure to the high
   activities Ra-226. This suggests that radium does not have a serious
   impact on the ecology of the system and the level of radium that would
   be transferred to humans is very low. The results may be important in
   the assessment of long-term environmental impacts of Ra-226 exposure.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method for the dimensional synthesis of fully
   constrained spatial cable-driven parallel mechanisms (CDPMs), namely,
   the problem of finding a geometry whose wrench-closure workspace (WCW)
   contains a prescribed workspace. The proposed method is an extension to
   spatial CDPMs of a synthesis method previously published by the authors
   for planar CDPMs. The WCW of CDPMs is the set of poses for which any
   wrench can be produced at the end-effector by non-negative cable
   tensions. A sufficient condition is introduced in order to verify
   whether a given six-dimensional box, i.e., a box covering
   point-positions and orientations, is fully inside the WCW of a given
   spatial CDPM. Then, a nonlinear program is formulated, whose optima
   represent CDPMs that can reach any point in a set of boxes prescribed by
   the designer. The objective value of this nonlinear program indicates
   how well the WCW of the resulting CDPM covers the prescribed box, a null
   value indicating that none of the WCW is covered and a value greater or
   equal to one indicating that the full prescribed workspace is covered.}},

Abstract = {{This work deals with fatty acid-assisted high yield synthesis of cadmium

   by solvothermal treatment of thiourea (TU) mixed cadmium-oleate (Cd-O)

   thermal decomposition of TU and produced OA-capped CdS nanocrystals
   (NCs) composed cauliflower-like mesoporous CdS MSs with an average size
   of 1.5 pm. The as-synthesized CdS MSs exhibit good physicochemical
   properties. Moreover, the as-synthesized CdS MSs showed pronounced
   photocatalytic activity to degrade rhodamine B (RhB) in aqueous medium.
   This suggested that the as-synthesized CdS MSs might be used as a

Abstract = {{Lactococcal siphophages from the 936 and P335 groups infect the
   Gram-positive bacterium Lactococcus lactis using receptor binding
   proteins (RBPs) attached to their baseplate, a large multiprotein
   complex at the distal part of the tail. We have previously reported the
   crystal and electron microscopy (EM) structures of the baseplates of
   phages p2 (936 group) and TP901-1 (P335 group) as well as the full EM
   structure of the TP901-1 virion. Here, we report the complete EM
   structure of siphophage p2, including its capsid, connector complex,
   tail, and baseplate. Furthermore, we show that the p2 tail is
   characterized by the presence of protruding decorations, which are
   related to adhesins and are likely contributed by the major tail protein
   C-terminal domains. This feature is reminiscent of the tail of
   Escherichia coli phage lambda and Bacillus subtilis phage SPP1 and might
   point to a common mechanism for establishing initial interactions with
   their bacterial hosts. Comparative analyses showed that the architecture
   of the phage p2 baseplate differs largely from that of lactococcal phage
   TP901-1. We quantified the interaction of its RBP with the saccharidic
   receptor and determined that specificity is due to lower k(off) values
   of the RBP/saccharidic dissociation. Taken together, these results
   suggest that the infection of L. lactis strains by phage p2 is a
   multistep process that involves reversible attachment, followed by
   baseplate activation, specific attachment of the RBPs to the saccharidic
   receptor, and DNA ejection.}},

Abstract = {{The skin acts mainly as a protective barrier from the external
   environment, thanks to the stratum corneum which is the outermost layer
   of the skin. As in vitro tests on skin are essential to elaborate new
   drugs, the development of skin models closer to reality becomes
   essential. It is now possible to produce in vitro human skin substitutes
   through tissue engineering by using the self-assembly method developed
   by the Laboratoire d'Organog,nSse Exp,rimentale. In the present work,
   infrared microspectroscopy imaging analyses were performed to get
   in-depth morpho-spectral characterization of the three characteristic
   layers of human skin substitutes and normal human skin, namely the
   stratum corneum, living epidermis, and dermis. An infrared spectral
   analysis of the skin is a powerful tool to gain information on the order
   and conformation of the lipid chains and the secondary structure of
   proteins. On one hand, the symmetric stretching mode of the lipid
   methylene groups (2,850 cm(-1)) is sensitive to the acyl chain
   conformational order. The evolution profile of the frequency of this
   vibrational mode throughout the epidermis suggests that lipids in the
   stratum corneum are more ordered than those in the living epidermis. On
   the other hand, the frequencies of the infrared components underneath
   the envelop of the amide I band provide information about the overall
   protein conformation. The analysis of this mode establishes that the
   proteins essentially adopt an alpha-helix conformation in the epidermis,
   probably associated with the presence of keratin, while modifications of
   the protein content are observed in the dermis (extracellular matrix
   made of collagen). Finally, the lipid organization, as well as the
   protein composition in the different layers, is similar for human skin
   substitutes and normal human skin, confirming that the substitutes
   reproduce essential features of real skin and are appropriate
   biomimetics.}},

Abstract = {{The phenomenon of excess pore water pressure increase or stagnation and
   continuing large ground deformation in soft sensitive clay following the
   completion of construction of embankment is simulated for a case study
   at Saint Alban, Quebec, Canada. The present model employs an updated
   Lagrangian finite element framework and is combined with an automatic
   time increment selection scheme. The simulation based on an
   elasto-viscoplastic constitutive model considers soil-structure
   degradation effect. It is shown that without consideration for the
   microstructural degradation effect, it is not possible to reproduce the
   field responses of soft sensitive clay even during the construction of
   the embankment. When the soil-structure degradation effect is
   considered, the present model can offer reasonably accurate prediction
   for the consolidation behavior of soft sensitive clay, including the
   so-called anomalous pore water pressure generation and continuing large
   deformation even after the end of construction, which has been posing
   numerous uncertainties on the long-term performance of earth structures.

Abstract = {{The longevity of ore pass systems is an important consideration in
   underground mines. This is controlled to a degree by the structural
   stability of an ore pass which can be compromised by changes in the
   stress regime and the degree of fracturing of the rock mass. A failure
   mechanism specific to ore pass systems is damage on the ore pass wall by
   impact load or wear by material flow. Structural, stress and material
   flow-induced failure mechanisms interact with severe repercussions,
   although in most cases one mechanism is more dominant. This paper aims
   to provide a better understanding of the interaction of ore pass failure
   mechanisms in an operating mine. This can provide an aid in the design
   of ore pass systems. A two-stage numerical approach was used for the
   back analysis of an ore pass at Brunswick mine in Canada. The first
   stage in the analysis relied on a 3D boundary element analysis to define
   the stress regime in the vicinity of the ore pass. The second stage used
   a synthetic rock mass (SRM) model, constructed from a discrete fracture
   network, generated from quantitative rock mass field data. The fracture
   network geometry was introduced into a bonded particle model, in a
   particle flow code (PFC). Subsequently, the ore pass was excavated
   within the SRM model. A stability analysis quantified the extent of rock
   mass failure around the ore pass due to the interaction of pre-existing
   fractures and the failure of the intact rock bridges between these
   fractures. The resulting asymmetric failure patterns along the length of
   the ore pass were controlled to a large degree by the in situ fractures.
   The influence of particle flow impact was integrated into the model by
   projecting a discrete rock fragment against the ore pass walls
   represented by the SRM model. The numerical results illustrated that
   material impact on ore pass walls resulted in localised damage and
   accelerated the stress-induced failure.}},

Abstract = {{Many strategies have been reported to improve compatibility of

   these two polymers, based on their potential for globular protein

   elemental analyses, FTIR, XPS and SEM. Characterization techniques
   showed that the chitosan chain was modified and confirmed the existence
   of sulfonate groups, as well as in the kappa-carrageenan chain,
   indicating surfaces with similar chemical properties to those of
   heparin. The effect of charge density was observed for each adsorption
   condition (BSA at pH 5.0 and 7.4). A more pronounced adsorption rate was
   observed at pH 5.0 than at pH 7.4 and equilibrium adsorption was
   achieved, in both cases, after approximately 20 min. The equilibrium
   data indicate a lower adsorption rate for the sulfonated chitosan film,
   in comparison to the other films. These results confirm the potential of
   modified chitosan for use in applications in which globular protein
   adsorption should be avoided. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In divergent supply chains, such as in the oil industry, processing raw
   materials results in an outflow of multiple products. Final products are
   stored at international depots, from where they are ready to be shipped
   to the markets. Even if one company controls the entire chain, when
   production and sales organizations are decoupled, a relevant problem is
   to determine the internal prices of products at depots for achieving
   coordination. We propose an optimization model involving pricing and
   production decisions, and several constraints commonly used in divergent
   chains. In our approach, the producer incorporates the sellers' behavior
   by expressing demand as a function of the internal price. As a result,
   our model serves as a coordination mechanism in trying to get an overall
   coordinated integrated solution in a decoupled reality. Numerical
   examples in single and multiple periods problems show the advantages of
   our approach over cost-based methods.}},

Abstract = {{Sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone),copolymers (SPEEK) with a range of

   substitution polycondensation from hydroquinone and sulfonated
   hydroquinone. Membranes obtained by solvent casting from
   dimethylacetamide onto glass surfaces were analyzed for surface
   behavior. The surfaces of a membrane were hydrophobic in air, but
   hydrophilic in water. This surface behavior was corroborated by water
   contact angle vs. time, using sessile drop measurements. Hydrophilic
   sulfonic group aggregates on SPEEK chain and various media contacting
   with the top or bottom surfaces of the membrane during the fabrication
   process caused differences in surface behavior. Angle-dependent XPS
   showed that there was a higher atomic S/C ratio of the bottom surface
   than on the corresponding top surface. The hydrophilic sulfonic groups
   were in higher concentration within the membrane, with the concentration
   gradually decreasing towards the surface for SPEEK-HQ80 and SPEEK-HQ-70
   membranes. Acidification with strong acid and higher temperature induced
   a more hydrophilic surface on a membrane than a milder acidification
   process. The depth profile at the membrane surface was examined by a
   combination of contact angle, XPS and ATR-FTIR. (C) 2013 Crown Copyright

Title = {{Critical supply network protection against intentional attacks: A

Journal = {{RELIABILITY ENGINEERING \& SYSTEM SAFETY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{119}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A crucial issue in today's critical supply chains is how to protect
   facilities against intentional attacks, since it has become unacceptable
   to ignore the high impact of low probability disruptions caused by these
   attacks. This article develops a game-theoretical model to deal with the
   protection of facilities, in the context of the uncapacitated
   fixed-charge location problem. Given a set of investment alternatives
   for protecting the facilities against identified threats, the objective
   is to select the optimal defence strategy. The attacker is considered as
   a player who tries to maximise the expected damage while weighing
   against the attacks expenditures. The conflict on facilities
   vulnerability is modelled using the concept of contest. The
   vulnerability of a facility is defined by its destruction probability.
   Contest success functions determine the vulnerability of each facility
   dependent on the relative investments of the defender and the attacker
   on each facility, and on the characteristics of the contest. A method is
   developed to evaluate the utilities of the players (i.e., the defender
   and the attacker). This method evaluates many expected costs, including
   the cost needed to restore disabled facilities, the backorder cost, and
   the cost incurred because of the increase in transportation costs after
   attacks. In fact, when one or several facilities are unavailable,
   transportation costs will increase since reassigned customers may
   receive shipments from facilities which are farther away. The model
   considers a non-cooperative two-period game between the players, and an
   algorithm is presented to determine the equilibrium solution and the
   optimal defence strategy. An illustrative example is presented. The
   approach is compared to other suggested strategies, and some managerial
   insights are provided in the context of facility location. (C) 2013

Journal = {{MEAT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{616-620}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Infrared thermography (IRT) body temperature readings were taken in the
   ocular region of 258 pigs immediately before slaughter. Levels of
   lactate were measured in blood taken in the restrainer. Meat quality was
   assessed in the longissimus dorsi (LD), semimembranosus (SM), and
   adductor muscles. Ocular IRT (IROT) temperature was correlated with
   blood lactate levels (r = 0.20; P = 0.001), with pH taken 1 hour
   postmortem (pH1: r = -0.18; P = 0.03) and drip loss (r = 0.20; P = 0.02)
   in the LD muscle, and with pH1 in the SM muscle (r = -0.20; P = 0.02).
   Potentially, IROT may be a useful tool to assess the physiological
   conditions of pigs at slaughter and predict the variation of important
   meat quality traits. However, the magnitude of the correlations is
   rather low, so a further development of image capture technique and
   further studies under more variable preslaughter conditions ensuring a
   larger pork quality variation are needed. Crown Copyright (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Lactulose production is a complex process that is affected by several
   operational and experimental conditions. This study investigated the
   production of prebiotic lactulose using an electro-activation reactor.
   The experiments were performed at an ambient temperature (22 +/- 1

   maintained at 5\% (w/v). This work used HPLC to investigate the
   retention behaviors of the disaccharides (lactulose and lactose) and the
   by-products of lactulose production (glucose, galactose and fructose)
   under varying experimental conditions such as electric potential
   difference, central cell compartment electrolyte concentration and
   electro-activation time. The results were then correlated with the
   electric current density, the electrical global resistance of the
   system, the pH, the temperature and the Joule heating effect. The
   highest lactulose yield that was obtained during the isomerization of
   lactose was approximate to 30\% at a voltage of U = 28 V, an electrolyte

   appropriate way to select the best conditions to elude the unwanted
   wetting phenomenon in membrane contactors (MC). From new experimental
   data and a systematic review from literature, several significant
   results were obtained. First, a new and very simple classification
   method for the estimation of surface tension of aqueous amine, alcohol
   or alkanolamine solutions was developed. Second, in addition to
   polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and polypropylene (PP) (to a lesser
   extend), laminated PTFE/PP membranes were found to be an interesting
   alternative to be considered in plate MC because the lamination process
   leads to higher contact angle values. Finally, a new criterion for
   long-term performance of gas absorption in MC was proposed. It was
   estimated that a ratio between the liquid overpressure and the nominal
   breakthrough pressure less than 1.5\% could be a useful criterion to
   prevent membrane wetting and several actions were suggested to respect
   it. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the use of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to evaluate
   the performance of seventeen control strategies in wastewater treatment
   plants (WWTPs). It tackles the importance of using site-specific factors
   for nutrient enrichment when decision-makers have to select best
   operating strategies. Therefore, the LCA evaluation is repeated for
   three different scenarios depending on the limitation of nitrogen (N),
   phosphorus (P), or both, when evaluating the nutrient enrichment impact
   in water bodies. The LCA results indicate that for treated effluent
   discharged into N-deficient aquatic systems (e.g. open coastal areas)
   the most eco-friendly strategies differ from the ones dealing with
   discharging into P-deficient (e.g. lakes and rivers) and N\&P-deficient
   systems (e.g. coastal zones). More particularly, the results suggest
   that strategies that promote increased nutrient removal and/or energy
   savings present an environmental benefit for N\&P and P-deficient
   systems. This is not the case when addressing N-deficient systems for
   which the use of chemicals (even for improving N removal efficiencies)
   is not always beneficial for the environment. A sensitivity analysis on
   using weighting of the impact categories is conducted to assess how
   value choices (policy decisions) may affect the management of WWTPs. For
   the scenarios with only N-limitation, the LCA-based ranking of the
   control strategies is sensitive to the choice of weighting factors,
   whereas this is not the case for N\&P or P-deficient aquatic systems.

Abstract = {{The effects of inclination on the hydrodynamic behavior of a packed bed
   operating under gas-liquid cocurrent upflow were experimentally
   investigated in terms of liquid saturation, bed overall pressure drop
   and gas-liquid segregation. The non-invasive electrical capacitance
   tomography (ECT) imaging technique was applied to scrutinize local and
   axial phase distribution pattern and cross-sectionally averaged liquid
   saturation. The results indicate that bed inclination creates short
   circuits for the gas phase along the upper wall where it can flow in a
   segregated manner. Inception of transition from bubble to segregated
   flow regime was identified through monitoring a defined uniformity
   factor for ECT images. Phase segregation developed along the bed with
   minimum impact in the region close to the entrance. The removed bubbles
   were replaced by liquid phase resulting in higher liquid saturation
   values as complete segregation state was approached. The effect of
   operating conditions on axial profile of liquid saturation was examined.

Title = {{Deriving effective atomic numbers from DECT based on a parameterization
   of the ratio of high and low linear attenuation coefficients}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Dual energy computed tomography (DECT) can provide simultaneous
   estimation of relative electron density rho(e) and effective atomic
   number Z(eff). The ability to obtain these quantities (rho(e), Z(eff))
   has been shown to benefit selected radiotherapy applications where
   tissue characterization is required. The conventional analysis method
   (spectral method) relies on knowledge of the CT scanner photon spectra
   which may be difficult to obtain accurately. Furthermore an approximate
   empirical attenuation correction of the photon spectrum through the
   patient is necessary. We present an alternative approach based on a
   parameterization of the measured ratio of low and high kVp linear
   attenuation coefficients for deriving Z(eff) which does not require the
   estimation of the CT scanner spectra. In a first approach, the tissue
   substitute method (TSM), the Rutherford parameterization of the linear
   attenuation coefficients was employed to derive a relation between
   Z(eff) and the ratio of the linear attenuation coefficients measured at
   the low and high kVp of the CT scanner. A phantom containing 16 tissue
   mimicking inserts was scanned with a dual source DECT scanner at 80 and
   140 kVp. The data from the 16 inserts phantom was used to obtain model
   parameters for the relation between Z(eff) and mu vertical
   bar(80kVp)(140kVp). The accuracy of the method was evaluated with a
   second phantom containing 4 tissue mimicking inserts. The TSM was
   compared to a more complex approach, the reference tissue method (RTM),
   which requires the derivation of stoichiometric fit parameters. These
   were derived from the 16 inserts phantom scans and used to calculate CT
   numbers at 80 and 140 kVp for a set of tabulated reference human
   tissues. Model parameters for the parameterization of mu vertical
   bar(80kVp)(140 kVp) were estimated for this reference tissue dataset and
   compared to the results of the TSM. Residuals on Z(eff) for the
   reference tissue dataset for both TSM and RTM were compared to those
   obtained from the spectral method. The tissue substitutes were well
   fitted by the TSM with R-2 = 0.9930. Residuals on Z(eff) for the
   phantoms were similar between the TSM and spectral methods for Z(eff) <
   8 while they were improved by the TSM for higher Z(eff). The RTM fitted
   the reference tissue dataset well with R-2 = 0.9999. Comparing the
   Z(eff) extracted from TSM and the more complex RTM to the known values
   from the reference tissue dataset yielded errors of up to 0.3 and 0.15
   units of Z(eff) respectively. The parameterization approach yielded
   standard deviations which were up to 0.3 units of Z(eff) higher than
   those observed with the spectral method for Z(eff) around 7.5.
   Procedures for the DECT estimation of Z(eff) removing the need for
   estimates of the CT scanner spectra have been presented. Both the TSM
   and the more complex RTM performed better than the spectral method. The
   RTM yielded the best results for the reference human tissue dataset
   reducing errors from up to 0.3 to 0.15 units of Z(eff) compared to the
   simpler TSM. Both TSM and RTM are simpler to implement than the spectral
   method which requires estimates of the CT scanner spectra.}},

Title = {{Ion exchange membranes controlled electro-catalytic synthesis of
   lactulose from lactose under refrigerated conditions}},
Journal = {{INNOVATIVE FOOD SCIENCE \& EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{20}},
Pages = {{299-309}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Lactulose is considered as a prebiotic because it promotes the
   intestinal proliferation of Bifidobacterium which is added to various
   milk products. Moreover, lactulose is used in pharmaceuticals as a
   gentle laxative and to treat hyperammonemia. This study was aimed to
   synthesize lactulose from lactose isomerization by using an
   electro-activation reactor in which the alkaline conditions were
   controlled by ion exchange membranes under refrigerated conditions
   including 0 degrees C. In contrast to the production of lactulose by
   both chemical methods, which present many problems of purification and
   sugar degradation, and enzymatic methods, which is very expensive, the
   electro-activation is a very clean, safe and an economic green
   electro-membrane method to produce lactulose. The effects of Froude
   number (Fr), working temperature (T-Working) and feed lactose
   concentration (C-Lactose) on pH, conductivity, current density and
   lactulose yields are evaluated in this work. Then, it is shown that the
   highest lactulose yield of 25 +/- 1.28\% with a purity of 95 +/- 134\%
   in the final product is obtained at Fr = 2.05.10(-2), T-Working = 0-10
   degrees C. C-Lactose = 10\%, tau = 2 mm, pH = 1030, lambda = 4.64 mS/cm,
   i = 4.86 mA/cm(2) and U = 30 V. Using the experimental data given at
   time, tau = 10 mm, sulfate sodium concentration in central and anodic
   compartment, C-Na2SO4 = 0.3 M/L, and voltage, U = 38 V, three
   correlations are proposed to predict the medium alkalinity (pH), the
   medium conductivity (lambda), and the current density (i) which have the
   highest significance on lactose isomerization into lactulose.
   Industrial relevance: Lactulose is a well-known prebiotic and is mainly
   produced by chemical or enzymatic methods. The first is expensive and
   difficult to control. The end product is a mixture of different
   compounds that need to be purified. The second is more selective but
   very expensive. The application of electro-activation under near or
   sub-zero temperatures offers the possibility to produce high purity
   lactulose following electro-activation of a lactose solution. The cost
   of this technology can be very interesting for the industry and more
   lactose will thus be valorized. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The emergence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and plasmid-mediated
   resistance to quinolones has been previously found to be associated with
   the dissemination of complex class 1 integrons in Argentina. In this
   study, we analyzed their distribution through time and evaluated the
   functionality of the Orf513 protein, which is the putative recombinase
   of the ISCR1 mobile element. We investigated the presence of the orf513,
   bla(CTX-M-2), dfrA3b, qnrB10 and bla(DHA-1) genes by PCR and DNA
   sequencing as well as their linkage to class 1 integrons in 451
   non-epidemiologically related nosocomial strains resistant to at least
   one expanded-spectrum cephalosporin and to one aminoglycoside, isolated
   between 1989 and 2010 from 7 hospitals from Buenos Aires City. The
   epidemiology of complex class 1 integrons was found to be notably
   different among fermenting (94/171) and non-fermenting clinical bacilli
   isolates (1/280). The ISCR1::qnrB10 positive isolates were found since
   1993, confirming its presence in clinical isolates more than a decade
   before its first description. As expected, In35::ISCR1::bla(CTX-M-2) was
   the most common complex class 1 integron among Enterobacteriaceae
   isolates, particularly in Proteus mirabilis. Experimental analysis
   corroborated the activity of the Orf513 protein, which was found to bind
   specific DNA sequences containing the previously suggested oriIS region.
   These findings showed the high dispersion and maintenance of complex
   class 1 integrons across time in our nosocomial isolates. The
   contribution of the ISCR1 mobile element to multidrug resistant
   phenotypes is significant due to its sustained association to class 1
   integrons. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of spatial resolution of planar particle image velocimetry
   (PIV) on vortex size, swirling strength, circulation and population
   density characterisation are analysed using a series of experimental and
   numerical databases. The databases comprise a PIV database of an
   adverse-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer (APG TBL), a PIV
   database of a zero-pressure-gradient (ZPG) TBL in streamwise-wall-normal
   planes and streamwise-wall-normal slices of a direct numerical
   simulation (DNS) of a ZPG TBL. The effects of interrogation window and
   mesh sizes on the vortex parameters are analysed in the outer region of
   these flows using different qualitative and quantitative approaches. The
   quantitative analysis mainly capitalises on the possibility of mimicking
   the PIV data-sets with the DNS one. These approaches allow us to not
   only isolate the effects of mesh size and the interrogation window size
   but also to deduce the combined effects of other measurement errors in
   PIV. Typical values of mesh size and interrogation window size
   (0.01-0.03 of the boundary layer thickness) and typical levels of
   measurement uncertainties have significant effects on the vortex
   parameters. Moreover, each PIV error source affects the vortex
   parameters in different and frequently opposite manners. Hence, an
   optimal selection of measurement parameters such as the interrogation
   window size is indispensable in order to minimise the effects of spatial
   resolution and other measurement errors on the vortex parameters.
   Guidelines are presented in the Conclusions section of this paper.
   Finally, it is found that all the vortex parameters, when averaged
   across the outer region, are reasonably comparable in the ZPG and APG
   TBLs despite the fact that these are very different flows.}},

Title = {{Metal oxide-stabilized calcium oxide CO2 sorbent for multicycle
   operation}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{232}},
Pages = {{280-289}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This work proposes a number of metal oxide (M: Al, Zr, Mg and
   Y)-stabilized calcium oxide (CaO) CO2 sorbents directly produced from
   two-step calcination (argon and air atmospheres) of acidified natural
   limestone sources. The incorporation of a metal support into the CaO
   structure during limestone acidification step mainly aims to enhance
   sorbent stability. This study is focused on (i) the determination of the
   optimum mixing ratios, (ii) the analysis of the effect of precursor
   (soluble or insoluble) on sorbent activity, as well as (iii) the
   investigation of the influence of calcination atmosphere on sorbent
   durability and activity. A M/Ca molar ratio of 0.1 was found to offer
   the optimum composition to obtain the best activity for Zr- and
   Al-stabilized CaO samples under mild operating condition, while a M/Ca
   ratio of 0.4 was the optimum ratio for Mg-stabilized sorbent. The
   activity of metal (Zr, Al and Mg)-stabilized CaO sorbents with optimum
   composition was also investigated during severe operation condition
   (presence of CO2 in the calcination atmosphere), where an
   intensification of structural sintering is usually expected. The results
   indicated a considerable sorbent stability improvement for the metal
   oxide-stabilized CaO in comparison to pure CaO which showed significant
   cyclic capacity decay under similar conditions. Among the studied
   materials, Zr-stabilized CaO showed the most adequate behavior in severe
   operating condition. However, the cost impact of Zr-stabilized sorbent
   might be a matter of concern. On the contrary, Al-stabilized CaO sorbent
   could be an interesting choice due to low cost of Al-precursors used in
   the material preparation. The choice of Al-precursors, which was found
   to affect the sorbent activity, is discussed in detail. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Magnesium (Mg) alloys as well as experimental alloys are emerging as
   light structural materials for current, new, and innovative
   applications. This paper describes the influence of the alloying
   elements and the different casting processes on the microstructure and
   performance of these alloys and corrosion. It gives a comprehensible
   approach for the resistance of these alloys to general, localized and
   metallurgically influenced corrosion, which are the main challenges for
   their use. Exposure to humid air with similar to 65\% relative humidity
   during 4 days gives 100-150 nm thickness. The film is amorphous and has
   an oxidation rate less than 0.01 mu m/y. The pH values between 8.5 and
   11.5 correspond to a relatively protective oxide or hydroxide film;
   however above 11.5 a passive stable layer is observed. The poor
   corrosion resistance of many Mg alloys can be due to the internal
   galvanic corrosion caused by second phases or impurities. Agitation or
   any other means of destroying or preventing the formation of a
   protective film leads to increasing corrosion kinetics. The pH changes
   during pitting corrosion can come from two different reduction
   reactions: reduction of dissolved oxygen (O) and that of hydrogen (H)
   ions. Filiform corrosion was observed in the uncoated AZ31, while
   general corrosion mainly occurred in some deposition coated alloys.
   Crevice corrosion can probably be initiated due to the hydrolysis
   reaction. Exfoliation can be considered as a type of intergranular
   attack, and this is observed in unalloyed Mg above a critical chloride
   concentration.}},

Abstract = {{A general confined coassembly process has been demonstrated to produce
   discrete uniform mesoporous carbon microspheres with 0.8-1 mu m particle
   size using 3-1)-ordered macroporous silica as the template. The obtained
   mesoporous carbon microspheres (MC-MSs) have uniform and discrete
   spherical morphology, variable symmetry (hexagonal p6mm or cubic Im3m)
   of mesostructures, high specific surface areas (500-1100 m(2)/g), large
   pore volumes (0.6-2.0 cm(3)/g), and highly accessible large mesopores
   (7-10.3 nm). The particle size of the carbon microspheres can be easily
   tuned by simply using templates with different macropore sizes. It was
   found that the smaller MC-MSs (330 nm) with higher surface-to-volume
   ratio tend to shape into an integral monolithic MC-MS matrix and larger
   MC-MSs (>800 nm) with lower surface-to-volume ratio to discrete
   spherical morphology. This feature is attributed to the difference in
   shrinkage behavior of mesoporous carbon spheres confined in the
   macropores caused by the interaction between the silica wall and carbon
   microspheres. Adsorption experiments indicate that the cobaltbased
   nanoparticle-incorporated mesoporous carbon microspheres exhibit
   excellent size selectivity for protein adsorption in a complex solution
   and good magnetic separability for easy recycling.}},

Journal = {{FLOW MEASUREMENT AND INSTRUMENTATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{33}},
Pages = {{10-27}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Under rapidly fluctuating wind speed, high inertia cup anemometers have
   a tendency to overspeed. The main objective of this article is to
   develop an inverse time domain model that could be used in real-time
   during cup anemometer operation to minimize the so-called ``u-error{''}.
   A model proposed by Kristensen and an artificial neural network (ANN)
   direct model were first investigated to simulate the dynamic behavior of
   a heated cup anemometer with relatively high rotor inertia. Once the
   anemometer behavior was known, several virtual inputs were generated and
   the direct model was used to predict the instrument behavior. These
   models were built to emphasis the non-linear relationship between the
   free stream fluctuating wind and the wind speed measured by the
   anemometer. A semi-empirical inverse model derived from Kristensen's
   model was then studied and an ANN inverse model was suggested in order
   to minimize the so-called u-error. A methodology is proposed to gather
   the appropriate data to create both the direct and inverse model using
   an artificial neural network. The output of each model was compared with
   experimental data for validation and good agreement was found between
   the ANN models and the experimental data used for validation. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Vacuum cleaners can release large concentrations of particles, both in
   their exhaust air and from resuspension of settled dust. However, the
   size, variability, and microbial diversity of these emissions are
   unknown, despite evidence to suggest they may contribute to allergic
   responses and infection transmission indoors. This study aimed to
   evaluate bioaerosol emission from various vacuum cleaners. We sampled
   the air in an experimental flow tunnel where vacuum cleaners were run,
   and their airborne emissions were sampled with closed-face cassettes.
   Dust samples were also collected from the dust bag. Total bacteria,
   total archaea, Penicillium/Aspergillus, and total Clostridium cluster 1
   were quantified with specific quantitative PCR protocols, and emission
   rates were calculated. Clostridium botulinum and antibiotic resistance
   genes were detected in each sample using endpoint PCR. Bacterial
   diversity was also analyzed using denaturing gradient gel
   electrophoresis (DGGE), image analysis, and band sequencing. We
   demonstrated that emission of bacteria and molds
   (Penicillium/Aspergillus) can reach values as high as 1E5 cell
   equivalents/min and that those emissions are not related to each other.
   The bag dust bacterial and mold content was also consistent across the
   vacuums we assessed, reaching up to 1E7 bacterial or mold cell
   equivalents/g. Antibiotic resistance genes were detected in several
   samples. No archaea or C. botulinum was detected in any air samples.
   Diversity analyses showed that most bacteria are from human sources, in
   keeping with other recent results. These results highlight the potential
   capability of vacuum cleaners to disseminate appreciable quantities of
   molds and human-associated bacteria indoors and their role as a source
   of exposure to bioaerosols.}},

Title = {{3D tomodosimetry using long scintillating fibers: A feasibility study}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: 3D dosimetry is recognized as an ideal for patient-specific
   quality assurance (QA) of highly conformal radiotherapy treatments.
   However, existing 3D dosimeters are not straightforward to implement in
   the clinic, as their read-out procedure is often tedious and their
   accuracy, precision, and/or sample size exhibit limitations. The purpose
   of this work is to develop a 3D dosimeter based on the concept of
   tomodosimetry inside concentric cylindrical planes using long
   scintillating fibers for the QA of modern radiotherapy techniques such
   as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or intensity-modulated
   arc therapy (IMAT).
   Methods: Using a model-based simulation, scintillating fibers were
   modeled on three concentric cylindrical planes of radii 2.5, 5.0, and
   7.5 cm, inside a 10 cm radius water-equivalent cylinder phantom. The
   phantom was set to rotate around its central axis, made parallel to the
   linac gantry axis of rotation. Light acquisitions were simulated using
   the calculated dose from the treatment planning software and
   reconstructed in each cylindrical plane at a resolution of 1 mm(2) using
   a total-variation minimization iterative reconstruction algorithm. The
   3D dose was then interpolated from the reconstructed cylindrical plane
   doses at a resolution of 1 mm(3). Different scintillating fiber patterns
   were compared by varying the angle of each fiber in its cylindrical
   plane and introducing a light-tight cut in each fiber. The precision of
   the reconstructed cylindrical dose distribution was evaluated using a
   Poisson modeling of the acquired light signals and the accuracy of the
   interpolated 3D dose was evaluated using an IMRT clinical plan for a
   prostate case.
   Results: Straight scintillating fiber patterns with light-tight cuts
   were the most accurate in cylindrical dose reconstruction, showing less
   than 0.5 mm distance-to-agreement in dose gradients and a mean local
   dose difference of less than 0.2\% in the high dose region for a 10 x 10
   cm(2) field. The precision attained with this fiber configuration was
   less than 0.9\% in the high dose, low gradient region of an IMRT segment
   for light acquisitions of 0.1 MU over a 360 degree rotation of the
   cylinder phantom. 3D dose interpolation for the IMRT clinical plan
   yielded an overall dose difference with the reference input of less than
   1\%, except in high dose gradients.
   Conclusions: Using long scintillating fibers inside rotating, concentric
   cylindrical planes, the authors demonstrate that their tomodosimetry
   method has the potential for high resolution, precise, and accurate 3D
   dosimetry. Moreover, because of its water-equivalence and rotational
   symmetry, this design should find interesting application for both
   treatment QA and machine commissioning. (c) 2013 American Association of

Abstract = {{We present an automated two-dimensional Fourier transform (2D-FT)
   approach to analyze the local organization of myelinated axons in the
   spinal cord. Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy was
   used to observe lesions in a commonly used animal model of multiple
   sclerosis (MS), experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). A 2D-FT
   was applied on the CARS images to find the average orientation and
   directional anisotropy of the fibers within contiguous image domains. We
   introduce the corrected correlation parameter (CCP), a measure of the
   correlation between orientations of adjacent domains. We show that in
   the EAE animal model of MS, the CCP can be used to quantify the degree
   of organization/disorganization in the myelin structure. This analysis
   was applied to a large image dataset from animals at different clinical
   scores and we show that some descriptors of the CCP probability density
   function are strongly correlated with the clinical scores. This
   procedure, compatible with live animal imaging, has been developed to
   perform local in situ evaluation of myelinated axons afflicted by EAE.

Volume = {{53}},

Abstract = {{Three-layered structural composites were produced from municipal plastic
   wastes and wood flour residues to investigate the effects of design
   parameters on their flexural and impact performance. The studied
   parameters include wood content, thickness of individual composite
   layers, as well as stacking sequence and configuration (symmetric and
   asymmetric structures). The results indicate that the core layer has a
   lower influence on the flexural properties of structural beams in
   comparison with the skins. But depending on beam configuration (stacking
   sequence), different flexural characteristics can be obtained using the
   same composite layers. The classical beam theory was used to predict the
   flexural modulus with high precision. In addition, performance of the
   beams under impact tests was shown to be independent from their stacking
   sequences and layer thicknesses for each configuration. Crown Copyright

Journal = {{IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{5}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{We present the design and experimental demonstration of a
   contra-directional grating-coupled racetrack resonator exhibiting the
   Vernier effect. The device consists of two racetrack resonators that are
   coupled together in a cascaded configuration. The input coupler in each
   racetrack resonator of the cascaded configuration consists of
   contra-directional gratings. The benefit of using contra-directional
   couplers is their small bandwidth, as compared to co-directional
   couplers that do not have gratings. The simulation results show that
   this device provides numerous performance advantages compared to
   cascaded racetrack resonators exhibiting the Vernier effect without
   contra-directional grating couplers. Specifically, we eliminate the free
   spectral range (FSR, i.e., in both the drop port and the through port)
   and show substantial improvement in the interstitial peak suppression
   and the through port insertion loss for the cascaded racetrack resonator
   with gratings, as compared to the case without gratings. In addition,
   experimental results are presented, which show an interstitial peak
   suppression of 29.3 dB, as well as the elimination of the FSR in the
   drop port and the through port.}},

Abstract = {{When they are fed with bacteria, Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae
   produce and secrete multilamellar bodies (MLBs), which are composed of
   membranous material. It has been proposed that MLBs are a waste disposal
   system that allows D. discoideum to eliminate undigested bacterial
   remains. However, the real function of MLBs remains unknown.
   Determination of the biochemical composition of MLBs, especially lipids,
   represents a way to gain information about the role of these structures.
   To allow these analyses, a protocol involving various centrifugation
   procedures has been developed to purify secreted MLBs from
   amoeba-bacterium cocultures. The purity of the MLB preparation was
   confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and by immunofluorescence
   using H36, an antibody that binds to MLBs. The lipid and fatty acid
   compositions of pure MLBs were then analyzed by high-performance
   thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) and gas chromatography (GC),
   respectively, and compared to those of amoebae as well as bacteria used
   as a food source. While the bacteria were devoid of phosphatidylcholine
   (PC) and phosphatidyl-inositol (PI), these two polar lipid species were
   major classes of lipids in MLBs and amoebae. Similarly, the fatty acid
   composition of MLBs and amoebae was characterized by the presence of
   polyunsaturated fatty acids, while cyclic fatty acids were found only in
   bacteria. These results strongly suggest that the lipids constituting
   the MLBs originate from the amoebal metabolism rather than from
   undigested bacterial membranes. This opens the possibility that MLBs,
   instead of being a waste disposal system, have unsuspected roles in D.

Abstract = {{Bacteria and their viral predators (bacteriophages) are locked in a
   constant battle. In order to proliferate in phage-rich environments,
   bacteria have an impressive arsenal of defence mechanisms, and in
   response, phages have evolved counter-strategies to evade these
   antiviral systems. In this Review, we describe the various tactics that
   are used by phages to overcome bacterial resistance mechanisms,
   including adsorption inhibition, restriction-modification, CRISPR-Cas
   (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
   repeats-CRISPR-associated proteins) systems and abortive infection.
   Furthermore, we consider how these observations have enhanced our
   knowledge of phage biology, evolution and phage-host interactions.}},

Year = {{2013}},

Pages = {{21-36}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Freezeup processes in steep channels are particularly dynamic and
   generate important water level, water temperature, and discharge
   variations. This work presents unique field data quantifying steep
   channel ice processes during the freezeup period. Water temperature
   variability and ice dam buildup and breaching rates measured in the
   Montmorency watershed, Quebec, Canada are reported. The conditions
   leading to the development and melting of ice dams are discussed. The
   rate at which water is stored in the drainage system at different
   channel Strahler orders and the consequent freezeup flooding rates and
   discharge depressions are estimated.
   A major contribution of this paper is the formulation and application of
   an original heat budget model designed to specifically address the
   particularities of steep channel heat fluxes. The modeled net heat flux
   is compared with measured water temperature and with the timing of ice
   dam buildup and breaching events for a second order channel.
   This work can be of interest for cold region hydraulic and
   transportation engineers who are responsible for, the safe design of
   bridges and culverts, for cold region hydrologists, for hydroelectric
   producers and for water intake operators in need of evaluating and
   forecasting low freezeup discharge conditions. Freshwater and riparian
   zone biologists can also refer to this work to evaluate the conditions
   that affect the fauna and flora at freezeup and public emergency
   services can use this work to quantify the risk of freezeup flooding
   along steep channels. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   chromium, manganese, and copper). Static mechanical properties were also
   characterized. Results show that among all of the combinations of

Abstract = {{Pt nanoparticles as the common electrocatalyst for proton exchange
   membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) were prepared for the first time from metal
   organic frameworks (MOFs). Pt containing MOF was synthesized and
   subsequently subjected to pyrolytic carbonization under non-reactive gas
   atmosphere. Upon pyrolysis, Pt nanoparticles embedded in electronically
   conductive carbon media were produced. The assynthesized MOF materials
   and the prepared electrocatalysts were characterized by XRD, N-2
   physisorption, TEM and XPS. The Pt dispersion of obtained
   electrocatalysts was determined by hydrogen chemisorption. Their
   conductivity was measured by impedance spectroscopy. The
   membrane-electrode assemblies (MEAs) made of these electrocatalysts were
   tested as both anode and cathode in a H-2/air single cell fuel cell. As
   the anode, the most promising electrocatalyst (C-3) demonstrated an open
   circuit voltage of 970 mV and power density of 0.58 W mg(Pt)(-1)
   comparable to the commercial electrode power density (0.64 W mg(Pt)(-1))
   at 0.6 V in a single cell test. At the cathode, a power density of 0.38
   W mg(Pt)(-1) at 0.6 V was achieved. This confirms the promising
   potential of this simple approach to be used as a technique to prepare
   efficient fuel cell electrocatalysts. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   Statistical approaches}},
Journal = {{DESALINATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{325}},
Pages = {{7-15}},
Month = {{SEP 16}},
Abstract = {{Even if fouling in membrane bioreactors (MBRs) has been extensively
   studied during the last decade, its causes and mechanisms are not well
   understood yet. Furthermore, few full-scale and long-term experiments
   have been published, and their results do not always match with the
   models developed from lab-scale studies.
   A statistical approach linking long-term and short-term permeability
   evolution with operational variables in full-scale membrane bioreactors
   for domestic waste-water treatment is presented. Data originate from a
   66,700 P.E. MBR plant monitored for more than one year. Permeability and
   several fouling indicators were calculated in each of the four
   hollow-fibre membrane tanks of the plant. The influence of SRT,
   temperature, MLSS, F:M ratio, iron dosing and membrane flux on daily
   permeability evolutions, instantaneous permeability evolution and
   hydraulic backwash efficiency was studied. In order to minimise the bias
   due to correlations between input variables, a statistical approach
   using principal component regression and partial least-square regression
   was tested. Flux, temperature, SRT and F:M ratio are the most
   influential input variables on long-term permeability evolutions. Iron
   dose and MLSS are less correlated with fouling indicators. The proposed
   approach may be improved by integrating the history of the membrane to
   better describe and predict the permeability evolution. (C) 2013

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 10}},
Abstract = {{Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic human pathogen that
   can establish bacterial communication by synchronizing the behavior of
   individual cells in a molecular phenomenon known as ``quorum sensing''.
   Through an elusive mechanism involving gene products of the pqs operon,
   the PqsE enzyme is absolutely required for the synthesis of
   extracellular phenazines, including the toxic blue pigment pyocyanin,
   effectively allowing cells to achieve full-fledged virulence. Despite
   several functional and structural attempts at deciphering the role of
   this relevant enzymatic drug target, no molecular function has yet been
   ascribed to PqsE. In the present study, we report a series of alanine
   scanning experiments aimed at altering the biological function of PqsE,
   allowing us to uncover key amino acid positions involved in the
   molecular function of this enzyme. We use sequence analysis and
   structural overlays with members of homologous folds to pinpoint
   critical positions located in the vicinity of the ligand binding cleft
   and surrounding environment, revealing the importance of a unique
   C-terminal a-helical motif in the molecular function of PqsE. Our
   results suggest that the active site of the enzyme involves residues
   that extend further into the hydrophobic core of the protein, advocating
   for a lid-like movement of the two terminal helices. This information
   should help design virtual libraries of PqsE inhibitors, providing means
   to counter P. aeruginosa virulence acquisition and helping to reduce
   nosocomial infections.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports on using near-infrared (NIR) hyperspectral imaging
   for nondestructive spectral-spatial characterization of natural fiber
   composites. To illustrate the approach, maleic anhydride grafted
   polyethylene (MAPE)/hemp fiber composites were produced with different
   filler contents between 0 and 60\%. Two different chemometrics methods
   based on (1) the traditional multivariate PLS calibration and (2)
   multivariate image analysis and regression (MIA/MIR) were tested to
   predict tensile properties using NIR images. The results show good
   agreement between the measured properties and their predictions by both
   of these methods. The MIR ability to map chemical composition was
   compared to that of multivariate curve resolution (MCR) and the results
   were found similar. The proposed MIR approach was found very promising
   for quality control of polymer composites because of its combined
   ability to quantify filler content and dispersion within the material,
   to distinguish compositional variations from physical defects, and to
   predict the end-user properties of the product all with a single MIR
   model.}},

Abstract = {{In Canada, bioethanol is mainly produced from corn or wheat. Other
   alternative crops, such as sweet sorghum and sweet pearl millet, have
   been investigated in the province of Quebec, Canada, since they both
   have minimal fertilizer and water requirements. The objective of this
   study was to investigate the effects of compressive force and harvest
   time on the volume and sugar concentration of juice extracted from
   finely chopped biomass of sweet pearl millet and sweet sorghum. Trials
   using a specific screw press, both crop species, two harvest times, and
   three compressive forces were conducted at two experimental sites.
   Results showed that a compressive force between 310 and 379 kPa was
   adequate for juice extraction. Overall, a maximum of 632 mL juice kg(-1)
   biomass was extracted from sweet sorghum, compared to 509 mL kg-1 from
   sweet pearl millet. The screw press succeeded in extracting 63.3\% and
   74.9\% of the moisture from the biomass of sweet pearl millet and sweet
   sorghum, respectively Compressive force had no effect on the sugar
   concentration of both crop juices. However, the juice extracted with the
   screw press contained large quantities of unwanted residues. Sugar
   concentration of the juice was greatest at one of the two sites when the
   biomass was harvested and compressed in the afternoon. However, the
   harvest time had no effect on juice extraction at either site. Sweet
   sorghum contained significantly more sugars than sweet pearl millet and
   tended to contain more sucrose than glucose and fructose. This study
   demonstrates that sweet sorghum and sweet pearl millet are good sources
   of fermentable sugars. However, further research is needed to refine the
   harvesting and juice extraction processes.}},

Title = {{Giant effective liquid-self diffusion in stagnant liquids by magnetic
   nanomixing}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING AND PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{77-82}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Many chemical engineering applications require tools to intensify
   processes in regions where Fickian molecular diffusion is the dominant
   mechanism, such as in boundary layers, microporous catalysts or
   microfluidics. We demonstrate in this study that spinning magnetic
   nanoparticles (MNPs) by means of rotating magnetic fields (RMFs) gives
   rise to an intriguing nanomotion mechanism capable of triggering giant
   diffusion in stagnant liquids and thus able to stimulate transport
   beyond the molecular diffusion barrier especially in stagnant liquids.
   To evidence this mechanism, we report original water self-diffusion
   coefficients measured in aqueous media containing very low
   concentrations of ferrite MNPs that can be rotated in uniform RMF. The
   self-diffusion coefficient of distilled water (i.e., D-0 approximate to
   3.5 x 10(-9) m(2)/s) was enhanced up to 200 times by application of a
   rotating magnetic field in stagnant-liquid conditions. It was concluded
   that in absence of macroscopic convective flows, MNPs may prove to be
   efficient nanostirrers to enhance liquid transport properties at
   nanoscale. By delivering giant diffusion around them, rotating MNPs can
   constitute an appealing nanomixing process intensification tool. (C)

Abstract = {{The bacterium Aeromonas salmonicida, a fish pathogen, uses the type
   three secretion system (TTSS) to inject effector proteins into host
   cells to promote the infection. The study of the genome of A.
   salmonicida has revealed the existence of Ati2, a potential TTSS
   effector protein. In the present study, a structure-function analysis of
   Ati2 has been done to determine its role in the virulence of A.
   salmonicida. Biochemical assays revealed that Ati2 is secreted into the
   medium in a TTSS-dependent manner. Protein sequence analyses, molecular
   modelling and biochemical assays demonstrated that Ati2 is an inositol
   polyphosphate 5-phosphatase, which hydrolyses PtdIns(4,5)P-2 and
   PtdIns(3,4,5)P-3 in a way similar to VPA0450, a protein from Vibrio
   parahaemolyticus having high sequence similarity with Ati2. Mutants of
   Ati2 with altered amino acids at two different locations in the
   catalytic site displayed no phosphatase activity. Wild-type and mutant
   forms of Ati2 were cloned into expression systems for Dictyostelium
   discoideum, a soil amoeba used as an alternative host to study A.
   salmonicida virulence. Expression tests allowed us to demonstrate that
   Ati2 is toxic for the host cell in a catalytic-dependent manner.
   Finally, this study demonstrated the existence of a new TTSS effector
   protein in A. salmonicida.}},

Title = {{Interpreting streamflow generation mechanisms from integrated

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{9}},

Abstract = {{The understanding of streamflow generation processes is vitally
   important in the management of water resources. In the absence of the
   data required to achieve this, Integrated Surface-Subsurface
   Hydrological Models (ISSHM) can be used to assist with the development
   of this understanding. However, the standard outputs from these models
   only enable elicitation of information about hydrological drivers and
   hydrological responses that occur at the same time. This generally
   limits the applicability of ISSHMs for the purposes of obtaining an
   improved understanding of streamflow generation processes to catchment
   areas that do not exhibit significant storage, travel times or flow
   depletion mechanisms. In order to overcome this limitation, a previously
   published Hydraulic Mixing-Cell (HMC) method is improved so that it can
   be used to follow surface water derived from direct rainfall and
   groundwater discharge to the stream and adjacent overland flow areas.
   The developed approach was applied to virtual experiments (based on the
   Lehstenbach catchment in southeastern Germany), which are composed of
   two ISSHMs of contrasting scales: (1) a riparian wetland of area 210
   m(2) and (2) a catchment of area 4.2 km(2). For the two models, analysis
   of modeling results for a large storm event showed complex
   spatiotemporal variability in streamflow generation and surface
   water-groundwater interaction. Further analysis with the HMC method
   elucidated in-stream and overland flow generation mechanisms. This study
   showed within a modeling framework that identification and
   quantification of in-stream and overland flow generation better informed
   understanding of catchment functioning through decomposition of
   streamflow hydrographs, and analysis of spatiotemporal variability of
   flow generation mechanisms.}},

   study in Bamako (Mali) in children under five years old. Participants in
   the Pesinet service were recruited from a neighbourhood of Bamako (n =
   91) and participants in the control group (usual care) came from two
   other neighbouring districts (n = 89). Eight questionnaires were
   completed at 2-week intervals for each child in the study. We performed
   logistic regression modelling to assess the effect of the Pesinet
   programme on health service utilisation, adjusting for confounding
   variables (age and socio-economic status). During the study, families
   reported 206 episodes of disease in the intervention group and 168 in
   the control group. Children from the intervention group had 85 medical
   consultations and those in the control group had 28. Based on the
   logistic regression model, there was increased utilisation of health
   care services among children enrolled in the Pesinet programme, with an
   adjusted Odds Ratio for medical consultations of 2.2. Membership of the
   Pesinet telehealth programme increased primary healthcare utilisation

Abstract = {{A set of field experiments using multiple transmitter center frequencies
   was completed to test the application potential of low-frequency
   full-waveform sonic logging in large-diameter production wells. Wireline
   logs were acquired in a simple open drillhole and a high-yield large
   diameter production well completed with wire-wound sand screens at an
   aquifer storage and recovery site in Perth, Western Australia.
   Phase-shift transform methods were applied to obtain phase-velocity
   dispersion images for frequencies of up to 4 kHz. A 3D representation of
   phase-velocity dispersion was developed to assist in the analysis of
   possible connections between low-frequency wave propagation modes and
   the distribution of hydraulic properties. For sandstone intervals in the
   test well, the highest hydraulic conductivity intervals were typically
   correlated with the lowest phase velocities. The main characteristics of
   dispersion images obtained from the sand-screened well were highly
   comparable with those obtained at the same depth level in a nearby
   simple drillhole open to the formation. The sand-screened well and the
   open-hole displayed an expected and substantial difference between
   dispersion in sand-and clay-dominated intervals. It appears that for
   clay-dominated formations, the rate of change of phase velocity can be
   associated to clay content. We demonstrated that with appropriate
   acquisition and processing, multifrequency full-waveform sonic logging
   applied in existing large-diameter sand-screened wells can produce
   valuable results. There are few wireline logging technologies that can
   be applied in this setting. The techniques that we used would be highly
   suitable for time-lapse applications in high-volume production wells or
   for reassessing formation properties behind existing historical
   production wells.}},

Abstract = {{Pb-0.5-0.7Ag anodes are widely used in the industry of zinc
   electrowinning. Two commercial lead anodes containing 0.56 and 0.69\%Ag
   were studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to evaluate their
   electrochemical activity. An industrial acid zinc sulphate electrolyte
   containing glue and chloride ion, but without manganese addition, was
   considered. In this study, 5 h of electrolysis at a density of 50 mA
   cm(-2) (currently used in practice) and also 6 h of potential decay were
   made to represent electrowinning periods of maintenance both at 38
   degrees C. During the 5 h polarisation, the average double layer
   capacity of Pb-0.56Ag alloy was higher (similar to 9\%) than that of
   Pb-0.69Ag alloy. During the first hour of potential decay, the Warburg
   impedance controls the electrochemical reaction. For the period from the
   second to sixth hour, the double layer capacity decreased with immersion
   time, and the charge transfer resistance increased with time. During the

Title = {{Numerical modeling of progressive failure and its implications for

Volume = {{50}},

Abstract = {{Spreads are a type of large landslide occurring in sensitive clays.
   Stability analyses using the limit equilibrium method give factors of
   safety that are too large and are therefore not applicable to this type
   of landslide. The progressive failure mechanism is believed to explain
   the initiation and propagation of the failure surface and the
   dislocation of the soil mass in horsts and grabens, typical of spreads.
   A numerical method is presented to identify the parameters influencing
   progressive failure and to validate the application of this mechanism to
   spreads. The method evaluates the stresses acting in the slope before
   failure and models the initiation and propagation of the progressive
   failure. It is demonstrated that high, steep slopes, with a large earth
   pressure ratio at rest, are more susceptible to progressive failure and
   the failure surface propagates over a large distance. Failure is more
   likely to occur when soil with high brittleness is involved. Soil with
   low strength at large deformation induces failure propagation over a
   larger distance. Eastern Canadian clays can exhibit high sensitivity and
   large brittleness during shear and are susceptible to progressive
   failure, which explains the occurrence of spreads in these soils.}},

Journal = {{POWDER TECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{246}},

Abstract = {{The anodes used in aluminum production are formed by compaction of a
   paste composed of binder matrix and coarse particles of petroleum coke
   (aggregates). Binder matrix composed of a coal tar pitch and fine
   calcined petroleum coke is usually characterized by coke and/or pitch
   content and also by the fineness of the coke particles. Since the coke
   particles are rigid and assumed to be non-deformable during compaction,
   the deformation behavior of the binder matrix plays a crucial role in
   the anode paste compaction process. Compaction of binder matrix with
   different compositions in a rigid closed die was studied in this work.
   Binder matrix compositions were compacted to a maximum uniaxial pressure
   of 70 MPa at 150 degrees C. Different strain rates of 2.9 x 10(-4) s(-1)
   and 2.9 x 10(-3) s(-1) enabled us to evaluate the contribution of
   viscous behavior of the material to the compaction of binder matrix as a
   function of its composition and deformation rate. A similar experimental
   compaction procedure with strain rates of 1.8 x 10(-4) s(-1) and 1.8 x
   10(-3) s(-1) was applied on paste samples with different pitch contents.
   This study revealed that the compaction of binder matrix and anode paste
   with conventional compositions is not significantly a time dependent
   process. Viscous behavior may therefore not have a significant
   contribution to the compaction of the material. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{While several approaches for global sensitivity analysis (GSA) have been
   proposed in literature, only few applications exist in urban drainage
   modelling. This contribution discusses two GSA methods applied to a
   sewer flow and sewer water quality model: Standardised Regression
   Coefficients (SRCs) using Monte-Carlo simulation as well as the Morris
   Screening method. For selected model variables we evaluate how the
   sensitivities are influenced by the choice of the rainfall event. The
   aims are to i) compare both methods concerning the similarity of results
   and their applicability, ii) discuss the implications for factor fixing
   (identifying non-influential parameters) and factor prioritisation
   (identifying important parameters) and iii) rank the important
   parameters for the investigated model. It was shown that both methods
   lead to similar results for the hydraulic model. Parameter interactions
   and non-linearity were identified for the water quality model and the
   parameter ranking differs between the methods. For the investigated
   model the results allow a sound choice of output variables and rainfall
   events in view of detailed uncertainty analysis or model calibration. We
   advocate the simultaneous use of both methods for a first model
   assessment as they allow answering both factor fixing and factor
   prioritisation at low computational cost. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Near-field plasmon coupling between neighboring gold nanoparticles,
   measured by polarized optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy, is
   employed to study the surface self-assembly of alcanethiol-capped gold
   nanoparticles during solvent evaporation. The waveguide used is a
   monomode optical fiber half-coupler. The sample is deposited on the
   surface of the waveguide and absorption spectra are continuously
   collected during the solvent evaporation process with a temporal
   resolution of 0.2 s. The absorption spectra show a progressive red shift
   of the plasmon peak caused by increasing interparticle near-field
   coupling. This shift can be used to determine the distance between
   particles by comparison to theoretical values calculated using the
   discrete dipoles approximation. The technique is demonstrated for the
   assembly of 10 nm gold particles capped with thiol ligands of two
   different lengths. Interestingly, in the case of dodecanethiol-capped
   particles, the extinction spectrum not only shifts to longer
   wavelengths, but also changes in shape during the drying process. About
   half a second before the solvent completely evaporates, the spectrum
   broadens as a second component appears. This feature is tentatively
   attributed to the formation of a significant population of particle
   clusters as a result of incomplete screening of van der Waals

Abstract = {{To survive in phage-containing environments, bacteria have evolved an
   array of antiphage systems. Similarly, phages have overcome these
   hurdles through various means. Here, we investigated how phages are able
   to circumvent the Lactococcus lactis AbiQ system, a type III
   toxin-antitoxin with antiviral activities. Lactococcal phage escape
   mutants were obtained in the laboratory, and their genomes were
   sequenced. Three unrelated genes of unknown function were mutated in
   derivatives of three distinct lactococcal siphophages: orf38 of phage
   P008, m1 of phage bIL170, and e19 of phage c2. One-step growth curve
   experiments revealed that the phage mutations had a fitness cost while
   transcriptional analyses showed that AbiQ modified the early-expressed
   phage mRNA profiles. The L. lactis AbiQ system was also transferred into
   Escherichia coli MG1655 and tested against several coliphages. While
   AbiQ was efficient against phages T4 (Myoviridae) and T5 (Siphoviridae),
   escape mutants of only phage 2 (Myoviridae) could be isolated. Genome
   sequencing revealed a mutation in gene orf210, a putative DNA
   polymerase. Taking these observations together, different phage genes or
   gene products are targeted or involved in the AbiQ phenotype. Moreover,
   this antiviral system is active against various phage families infecting
   Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. A model for the mode of action
   of AbiQ is proposed.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), as a reinforcing material, are extensively used
   in nanocomposites for their high stiffness and high strength. To analyze
   the mechanical properties of CNT reinforced polymer composites,
   continuum mechanics combined with finite elements methods (FEMs) is a
   very effective tool. However, adopting different numerical models will
   directly affect the computing efficiency. In this work, solid element,
   shell element and 3-D truss element are separately used to simulate
   single wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT). In addition, the effects of CNT
   aspect ratio on the mechanical properties of CNT reinforced
   polypropylene composites are investigated. As a first approximation, the
   polypropylene matrix material is assumed to be a linear elastic or an
   elastic-plastic material, while CNT is assumed to be a linear elastic
   material. A series of direct tensile numerical tests were carried out to
   get the elastic modulus of SWCNT/polypropylene composites and the
   transverse deformations of the composites are determined for the range
   of conditions tested. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{We study a problem of tactical planning in a divergent supply chain. It
   involves decisions regarding production, inventory, internal
   transportation, sales and distribution to customers. The problem is
   motivated by the context of a company in the speciality oils industry.
   The overall objective at tactical level is to maximize contribution and,
   in order to achieve this, the planning has been divided into two
   separate problems. The first problem concerns sales where the final
   sales and distribution planning is decentralized to individual sellers.
   The second problem concerns production, transportation and inventory
   planning through refineries, hubs and depots and is managed centrally
   with the aim of minimizing costs. Due to this decoupling, the solution
   of the two problems needs to be coordinated in order to achieve the
   overall objective. In the company, this is pursued through an internal
   price system aiming at giving the sellers the incentives needed to align
   their decisions with the overall objective. We propose and discuss
   linear programming models for the decoupled and integrated planning
   problems. We present numerical examples to illustrate potential effects
   of integration and coordination and discuss the advantages and
   disadvantages of the integrated over the decoupled approach. While the
   total contribution is higher in the integrated approach, it has also
   been found that the sellers' contribution can be considerably lower.
   Therefore, we also suggest contribution sharing rules to achieve a
   solution where both the company and the sellers attain a better outcome
   under the integrated planning. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Volume = {{566}},

Month = {{AUG 20}},
Abstract = {{An original method was developed to accurately quantify brucite content
   in mining residues whereby the thermal decomposition of pure brucite,
   olivine, serpentine and mining residues was comprehensively studied. The
   simultaneous dehydroxylation of brucite and various serpentine minerals
   was investigated using a combination of isothermal and nonisothermal
   thermogravimetric analyses with mass spectrometry. The dehydroxylation
   rate of brucite was highly influenced by its particle size distribution.
   However, the technique proposed here revealed similar particle size
   distributions of native brucite irrespective of the analyzed mining
   residue samples. This suggests the technique could also be extended to
   coarse mining residue particle samples containing invariant brucite size
   distributions. Native brucite dehydroxylation was shown to start at
   lower temperatures than serpentines. The weight loss due to
   dehydroxylation registered for brucite-doped olivine and residues
   revealed a quasi-linear correlation with brucite content (R-2 = 1) and
   provided a reliable and straightforward approach for the quantification
   of free brucite in single minerals as well as in mining residues. The
   accuracy was higher than most of the current techniques used for brucite
   quantification. The uncertainties were as low as similar to 0.05 wt\%
   for mining residues and similar to 0.02 wt\% for single minerals
   rendering this method a promising tool for native brucite
   quantification. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{As several other industries, primary aluminum production faces the
   challenge to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, mainly composed of
   carbon dioxide (CO2). This work presents a techno-economic analysis of
   the implementation of a carbon capture plant specifically designed for a
   primary aluminum smelter, in order to investigate the feasibility to
   reduce CO2 emitted by electrolytic cells. It allows to verify if the
   capture using the traditional monoethanolamine (MEA) aqueous solutions
   can be economically attractive for the aluminum industry. The CO2
   capture plant was sized and optimized taking into account typical
   aluminum production characteristics and several possible ways to capture
   CO2 were investigated. The effect of the increase of CO2 concentration
   in the flue gas (that could be achieved by reducing cell ventilation)
   and of plant thermal integration were taken into account in order to
   reduce the capture costs. It appears that 4 vol\% CO2 concentration in
   the flue gas is the most economically and technically sound
   configuration. In addition, waste heat recovery allows to reduce by 58\%
   the cost of capture if waste heat recovery is available in the primary
   aluminium smelter. Overall, the cost of capture could only represent
   2.06\% increase on its actual production cost (with carbon tax). (C)

Abstract = {{Non-specific adsorption of the molecular components of biofluids is
   ubiquitous in the area of biosensing technologies, severely limiting the
   use of biosensors in real-world applications. The surface chemistries
   developed to prevent non-specific adsorption of crude serum are not
   necessarily suited for sensing in other biosamples. In particular, the
   diagnostic potential of differential expression of proteins in tissues
   makes cell lysate attractive for disease diagnostics using solid
   biopsies. However, crude cell lysate poses a significant challenge for
   surface chemistries because of a large concentration of highly adherent
   lipids. Contrary to the nonspecific adsorption in crude serum being
   suppressed by hydrophilic surfaces, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
   analysis of serine-, aspartic-acid-, histidine-, leucine-, and
   phenylalanine-based peptide monolayers revealed that hydrophobic and
   positively charged peptides decreased non-specific adsorption when using
   lysate from HEK 293FT cells. A polyethylene glycol (PEG) monolayer
   resulted in 2-fold greater fouling than the best peptide
   {[}3-MPA-(His)(2)(Leu)(2)(Phe)(2)-OH] under the same conditions.
   Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization tandem time-of-flight mass
   spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS) analysis of the adsorbate from cell
   lysate confirmed that lipids are the main source of non-specific
   adsorption. Importantly, the mass spectrometry (MS) study revealed that
   both the number of lipids identified and their intensity decreased with
   decreasing non-specific adsorption. A peptide monolayer thus provides an
   efficient mean to suppress non-specific adsorption from this human cell
   lysate.}},

Abstract = {{PECs of chitosan/-carrageenan are prepared in three different volumetric

   decreases when the amount of chitosan increases. Due to the linked film
   formation, PECs decrease BSA adsorption and increase fibrinogen
   adsorption when compared to the pristine chitosan and -carrageenan
   films. Although pristine chitosan and -carrageenan films produced
   similar cell expansion and viability, the PEC 50:50 vol\%
   chitosan/-carrageenan PEC may be acceptable as a new scaffold for cell
   therapies, due to their effect on cell survival.}},

   singularity locus of the general Gough-Stewart platform. The
   third-degree vector expression obtained does not contain a constant
   term, which allows the factorization of an instance of the position
   vector, thereby leading to a very compact form. Additionally, an
   expression of the vector orthogonal to the singularity locus is obtained
   as a byproduct. An alternative expression that reduces the number of
   times that the position vector appears in the expression is also
   presented. It is shown that a simplified architecture such as that of
   the Minimal Simplified Symmetric Manipulator (MSSM) can significantly
   reduce the complexity of the coefficients appearing in the expression.}},

Abstract = {{Torrefaction is a thermal treatment applied to improve biomass
   properties for long-term storage and thermochemical conversion of wood.
   The torrefaction kinetic behavior of two woody biomass samples (aspen
   and birch) and their individual constituents (cellulose, xylan
   -hemicellulose proxy- and lignin) was studied in detail. The materials
   were torrefied in a fixed-bed reactor up to 280 degrees C and were
   characterized after 15 min and 60 min treatments in terms of their
   energy density, energy yield, H, O and degrees C contents, humidity
   uptake and FTIR vibrational spectra. Regardless of mildness (240 degrees
   C) or severity (280 degrees C) of torrefaction, hemicellulose was the
   most reactive. Compared to torrefied cellulose, lignin exhibited
   considerable activity and increased heating value under severe
   torrefaction (280 degrees C). Likewise, the increase in heating value of
   torrefied cellulose was less significant than that of lignin due to
   cellulose energy loss because of production of tar compounds. The
   release of volatiles versus time for cellulose, xylan and lignin
   torrefaction reactions measured using a thermogravimetric method was
   also modeled for each lump by means of the distributed activation energy
   model and a three-parameter log-normal distribution function. The model
   was found to fit the experimental data for xylan and lignin torrefaction
   while it showed slight under-prediction in the case of cellulose
   torrefaction. The distributed activation energy models developed for the
   individual lumps were combined into a meta-model to apprehend the
   torrefaction kinetics of actual (aspen and birch) woody biomass by
   assuming parallel and independent involvement of their three
   constituents present under various compositions. The model was found to
   represent with very good agreement the experimental data of aspen and
   birch torrefaction. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   fast, simple to use and tune, and as minimally intrusive as possible. In
   this paper, we developed a simple and fast algorithm to compute the
   cell-covered surface (degree of confluence) in phase-contrast microscopy
   images. This segmentation algorithm is based on a range filter of a
   specified size, aminimum range threshold, and aminimum object size
   threshold. These parameters were adjusted in order to maximize the
   F-measure function on a calibration set of 200 hand-segmented images,
   and its performance was compared with other algorithms proposed in the
   literature. A set of one million images from 37 myoblast cell cultures
   under different conditions were processed to obtain their cell-covered
   surface against time. The data were used to fit exponential and logistic
   models, and the analysis showed a linear relationship between the
   kinetic parameters and passage number and highlighted the effect of
   culture medium quality on cell growth kinetics. This algorithm could be
   used for real-time monitoring of cell cultures and for high-throughput
   screening experiments upon adequate tuning.}},

Abstract = {{Dry detention ponds are commonly implemented to mitigate the impacts of
   urban runoff on receiving water bodies. They currently rely on static
   control through a fixed limitation of their maximum outflow rate.
   Real-Time Control (RTC) allows optimizing their performance by
   manipulation of an outlet valve. This study developed several enhanced
   RTC scenarios of a dry detention pond located at the outlet of a small
   urban catchment near Quebec City, Canada. The catchment's runoff
   quantity and TSS concentration were simulated by a SWMM5 model with an
   improved wash-off formulation. The control procedures rely on rainfall
   detection, on measures of the pond's water height, and in some of the
   RTC scenarios on rainfall forecasts. The implemented RTC strategies
   allow a substantial improvement of the pond's performance - the TSS
   removal efficiency increases from 46\% (current state) to about 90\% -
   while remaining safe and taking a mosquito-breeding risk constraint into
   account.}},

   of 92.0\% after 30 min of reaction and a total metathesis product yield
   of 86.7\% with 52\% attributed to the desired metathesis products were

Abstract = {{A variety of propylammonium functionalized mesoporous silica materials
   (MS-NH3+) were synthesized via post-synthesis grafting and
   co-condensation and their efficiency to remove nitrate and phosphate
   anions in aqueous solution was investigated. Under the experimental
   conditions explored, the maximum removal for nitrate (36\%) was obtained
   using MCM-48 functionalized via grafting. In the case of phosphate
   anions, SBA-15 functionalized via grafting exhibited the best removal of
   56\%. The corresponding adsorption capacities reached 45 and 57
   mg/g-adsorbent for nitrate and phosphate, respectively. Using the MCM-48
   functionalized via grafting, a kinetic investigation was conducted at
   temperatures ranging from 5 to 45 degrees C. For both anions, the
   adsorption was shown to be very fast reaching the equilibrium within the
   first 5 min of contact time between the adsorbent and the anions
   solutions. The pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order and
   intra-particle diffusion kinetic models were used to describe the
   obtained data. The pseudo-second-order model was found to describe
   adequately the experimental kinetic data. The activation energies of
   adsorption evaluated using the pseudo-second-order rate constants were
   6.91 and 8.59 kJ/mol for nitrate and phosphate anions, respectively. (C)

Title = {{Assemblathon 2: evaluating de novo methods of genome assembly in three
   vertebrate species}},
Journal = {{GIGASCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{JUL 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: The process of generating raw genome sequence data continues
   to become cheaper, faster, and more accurate. However, assembly of such
   data into high-quality, finished genome sequences remains challenging.
   Many genome assembly tools are available, but they differ greatly in
   terms of their performance (speed, scalability, hardware requirements,
   acceptance of newer read technologies) and in their final output
   (composition of assembled sequence). More importantly, it remains
   largely unclear how to best assess the quality of assembled genome
   sequences. The Assemblathon competitions are intended to assess current
   state-of-the-art methods in genome assembly.
   Results: In Assemblathon 2, we provided a variety of sequence data to be
   assembled for three vertebrate species (a bird, a fish, and snake). This
   resulted in a total of 43 submitted assemblies from 21 participating
   teams. We evaluated these assemblies using a combination of optical map
   data, Fosmid sequences, and several statistical methods. From over 100
   different metrics, we chose ten key measures by which to assess the
   overall quality of the assemblies.
   Conclusions: Many current genome assemblers produced useful assemblies,
   containing a significant representation of their genes and overall
   genome structure. However, the high degree of variability between the
   entries suggests that there is still much room for improvement in the
   field of genome assembly and that approaches which work well in
   assembling the genome of one species may not necessarily work well for
   another.}},

Title = {{Global efficiency of local immunization on complex networks}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL 10}},
Abstract = {{Epidemics occur in all shapes and forms: infections propagating in our
   sparse sexual networks, rumours and diseases spreading through our much
   denser social interactions, or viruses circulating on the Internet. With
   the advent of large databases and efficient analysis algorithms, these
   processes can be better predicted and controlled. In this study, we use
   different characteristics of network organization to identify the
   influential spreaders in 17 empirical networks of diverse nature using 2
   epidemic models. We find that a judicious choice of local measures,
   based either on the network's connectivity at a microscopic scale or on
   its community structure at a mesoscopic scale, compares favorably to
   global measures, such as betweenness centrality, in terms of efficiency,
   practicality and robustness. We also develop an analytical framework
   that highlights a transition in the characteristic scale of different
   epidemic regimes. This allows to decide which local measure should
   govern immunization in a given scenario.}},

Title = {{Performance assessment of a 2D array of plastic scintillation detectors

Abstract = {{The purposes of this work are to assess the performance of a 2D plastic
   scintillation detectors array prototype for quality assurance in
   intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and to determine its
   sensitivity and specificity to positioning errors of one multileaf
   collimator (MLC) leaf and one MLC leaf bank by applying the principles
   of signal detection theory. Ten treatment plans (step-and-shoot
   delivery) and one volumetric modulated arc therapy plan were measured
   and compared to calculations from two treatment-planning systems (TPSs)
   and to radiochromic films. The averages gamma passing rates per beam
   found for the step-and-shoot plans were 95.8\% for the criteria (3\%, 2
   mm), 97.8\% for the criteria (4\%, 2 mm), and 98.1\% for the criteria
   (3\%, 3 mm) when measurements were compared to TPS calculations. The
   receiver operating characteristic curves for the one leaf errors and one
   leaf bank errors were determined from simulations (theoretical upper
   limits) and measurements. This work concludes that arrays of plastic
   scintillation detectors could be used for IMRT quality assurance in
   clinics. The use of signal detection theory could improve the quality of
   dosimetric verifications in radiation therapy by providing optimal
   discrimination criteria for the detection of different classes of
   errors.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of MnO4- and silver content on electrochemical behaviour of
   five commercial Pb-Ag alloy anodes was studied in acid zinc sulphate
   electrolyte with and without MnO4- ions at 38 degrees C during potential
   decay periods. When the anodes were immersed into acid zinc sulphate
   electrolyte without MnO4- ions, the Pb-0.72\%Ag anode entered complete
   passivation state in the shortest time among the five anodes, followed
   by anodes Pb-0.67\%Ag, Pb-0.60\%Ag, Pb-0.58\%Ag and Pb-0.29\%Ag-0.1\%Ca
   by measurement of open circuit potential. During immersion of the
   anodes, MnO4- ions accelerated the passivation and increased the
   corrosion current density of the anodes. After immersion in zinc
   electrolyte with MnO4-, the anode Pb-0.72\%Ag had the best corrosion
   resistance, followed by anodes Pb-0.67\%Ag, Pb-0.60\%Ag, then the close
   anodes Pb-0.58\%Ag and Pb-0.29\%Ag-0.1\%Ca by the electrochemical

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Bacteria have developed a set of barriers to protect themselves against
   invaders such as phage and plasmid nucleic acids. Different prokaryotic
   defence systems exist and at least two of them directly target the
   incoming DNA: restriction-modification (R-M) and CRISPR-Cas systems. On
   their own, they are imperfect barriers to invasion by foreign DNA. Here,
   we show that R-M and CRISPR-Cas systems are compatible and act together
   to increase the overall phage resistance of a bacterial cell by cleaving
   their respective target sites. Furthermore, we show that the specific
   methylation of phage DNA does not impair CRISPR-Cas acquisition or
   interference activities. Taken altogether, both mechanisms can be
   leveraged to decrease phage contaminations in processes relying on
   bacterial growth and/or fermentation.}},

Abstract = {{Lactococcal dairy starter strains are under constant threat from phages
   in dairy fermentation facilities, especially by members of the so-called
   936, P335, and c2 species. Among these three phage groups, members of
   the P335 species are the most genetically diverse. Here, we present the
   complete genome sequences of two P335-type phages, Q33 and BM13,
   isolated in North America and representing a novel lineage within this
   phage group. The Q33 and BM13 genomes exhibit homology, not only to
   P335-type, but also to elements of the 936-type phage sequences. The two
   phage genomes also have close relatedness to phages infecting
   Enterococcus and Clostridium, a heretofore unknown feature among
   lactococcal P335 phages. The Q33 and BM13 genomes are organized in
   functionally related clusters with genes encoding functions such as DNA
   replication and packaging, morphogenesis, and host cell lysis. Electron
   micrographic analysis of the two phages highlights the presence of a
   baseplate more reminiscent of the baseplate of 936 phages than that of
   the majority of members of the P335 group, with the exception of r1t and
   LC3.}},

Abstract = {{The introduction of multilocus sequence typing (MLST) for strain
   characterization provided the first sequence-based approach for
   genotyping many fungi, leading to reproducible, reliable, and
   exchangeable data. A MLST scheme based on the analysis of six
   housekeeping genes was developed for genotyping Geotrichum candidum. The
   scheme was first developed using 18 isolates for which the complete
   sequences of the alanyltRNA synthetase (ALA1), pyruvate kinase (CDC19),
   acetyl-coA acetyltransferase (ERG10), glutaminyl-tRNA synthase (GLN4),
   phosphoglucoisomerase (PGI1), and phosphoglucomutase (PGM2) housekeeping
   genes were determined. Multiple sequence alignments of these genes were
   used to define a set of loci showing, as closely as possible, the same
   phylogenetic resolution level as complete gene sequences. This scheme
   was subsequently validated with 22 additional isolates from dairy and
   non-dairy sources. Overall, 58 polymorphic sites were indexed among
   3,009 nucleotides analyzed. Depending on the loci, four to eight alleles
   were detected, generating 17 different sequence types, of which ten were
   represented by a single strain. MLST analysis suggested a predominantly
   clonal population for the 40G. candidum isolates. Phylogenetic analysis
   of the concatenated sequences revealed a distantly related group of four
   isolates. Interestingly, this group diverged with respect to internal
   transcribed spacers 1 (ITS1), 5.8S, and ITS2 analysis. The
   reproducibility of the MLST approach was compared to random
   amplification of microsatellites by PCR (RAMPCR), a gel profiling method
   previously proposed for G. candidum strain typing. Our results found
   MLST differentiation to be more efficient than RAM-PCR, and MLST also
   offered a non-ambiguous, unique language, permitting data exchange and
   evolutionary inference.}},

Abstract = {{The sulfur effect on conjugated linoleic acid isomer (CLA) formation
   during the combined hydrogenation/directed isomerization of safflower
   oil over a bifunctional (hydrogenation and isomerization) highly
   structured rhodium-based catalyst (Rh/SBA-15) was investigated either by
   direct addition of increased concentrations of
   3-mercapto-1,2-propanediol to the reaction medium or by doping Rh/SBA-15
   with the same sulfur-based compound yielding the sulfur-doped
   Rh-catalyst (S-Rh/SBA-15). These catalysts exhibited interesting
   activity, stability, and recyclability. The maximum CLA contents
   obtained during the combined reactions with 0, 0.2, 1, 2, 5, and 10ppm
   sulfur additions were 73, 99, 131, 110, 105, and 68mgCLAgoil-1,
   respectively, whereas the amount of harmful trans monoenes remained
   below 8\%. The safflower oil after partially hydrogenation under the
   same conditions over S-Rh/SBA-15 catalyst contained up to
   110mgCLAgoil-1. These results showed clear evidence of the sulfur
   promotion effect on CLA formation during the dual hydrogenation/directed
   isomerization of safflower oil. A mechanism for the sulfur promotion of
   the heterogeneous catalyst Rh/SBA-15 for the conjugated isomerization
   activity during hydrogenation/directed isomerization of safflower oil
   was determined by solid-state 1HNMR analysis of the fresh and spent
   catalysts. This was also confirmed by liquid-state 2HNMR analysis of
   deuterium-labeled product aliquots withdrawn throughout the reaction.
   The sulfur promotion towards the double bond conjugation of linoleic
   acid to form CLA isomers could be explained mechanistically through the
   preferable formation of the more nucleophilic rhodium sulfide (RhSH)
   over that of the hydride (RhH). However, both types of Rh clusters
   constituted distinct catalytic sites leading to the formation of
   hydrogenation as well as conjugated and geometric isomerization
   products. The lumped kinetics model described the experimental data well
   and complied simply with the proposed mechanism.}},

   with an eye toward its utilization for gene therapy. Such a review
   should be helpful for the potential user of this technology.
   Expert opinion: The principal hurdles toward the use of recombinant
   lentivirus as a gene therapy vector are the low titer at which it is
   produced as well as the difficulty to purify it at an acceptable level
   without degrading it. The recent advances in the bioproduction of this
   vector suggest these issues are about to be resolved, making the

Abstract = {{We have modified our particle-by-particle adaptation of the
   made-to-measure (M2M) method, with the aim of modelling the Galactic
   disc from upcoming Galactic stellar survey data. In our new
   particle-by-particle M2M algorithm, primal, the observables of the
   target system are compared with those of the model galaxy at the
   position of the target stars, i.e. particles. The mass of the model
   particles are adjusted to reproduce the observables of the target
   system, and the gravitational potential is automatically adjusted by the
   changing mass of the particles. This paper builds upon our previous
   work, introducing likelihood-based velocity constraints in primal. In
   this paper, we apply primal to barred disc galaxies created by an N-body
   simulation in a known dark matter potential, with no error in the
   observables. This paper demonstrates that primal can recover the radial
   profiles of the surface density, velocity dispersion in the radial and
   perpendicular directions, and the rotational velocity of the target
   discs, along with the apparent bar structure and pattern speed of the
   bar, especially when the reference frame is adjusted so that the bar
   angle of the target galaxy is aligned to that of the model galaxy at
   every timestep.}},

Abstract = {{Vascular occlusion remains the leading cause of death in Western
   countries, despite advances made in balloon angioplasty and conventional
   surgical intervention. Vascular surgery, such as CABG surgery,
   arteriovenous shunts, and the treatment of congenital anomalies of the
   coronary artery and pulmonary tracts, requires biologically responsive
   vascular substitutes. Autografts, particularly saphenous vein and
   internal mammary artery, are the gold-standard grafts used to treat
   vascular occlusions. Prosthetic grafts have been developed as
   alternatives to autografts, but their low patency owing to short-term
   and intermediate-term thrombosis still limits their clinical
   application. Advances in vascular tissue engineering technology-such as
   self-assembling cell sheets, as well as scaffold-guided and
   decellularized-matrix approaches-promise to produce responsive, living
   conduits with properties similar to those of native tissue. Over the
   past decade, vascular tissue engineering has become one of the
   fastest-growing areas of research, and is now showing some success in
   the clinic.}},

Abstract = {{We propose the use of the parallel tabu search algorithm (PTS) to solve
   combinatorial inverse design problems in integrated photonics. To assess
   the potential of this algorithm, we consider the problem of beam shaping
   using a two-dimensional arrangement of dielectric scatterers. The
   performance of PTS is compared to one of the most widely used
   optimization algorithms in photonics design, the genetic algorithm (GA).
   We find that PTS can produce comparable or better solutions than the GA,
   while requiring less computation time and fewer adjustable parameters.
   For the coherent beam shaping problem as a case study, we demonstrate
   how PTS can tackle multiobjective optimization problems and represent a
   robust and efficient alternative to GA. (C) 2013 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) are zoonotic pathogens
   transmitted to humans through contaminated water or bovine products. One
   of the strategies used by pathogenic bacteria to survive in aquatic
   environments is using free-living amoebae as hosts. Acanthamoeba
   castellanii is an amoeba known to host several waterborne pathogens.
   This study investigates the survival of EHEC with A.castellanii, which
   could contribute to its spread and transmission to humans. We used a
   gentamicin protection assay as well as fluorescence and electron
   microscopy to monitor the intra-amoebae survival of EHEC O157:H7 over
   24h. The results showed that EHEC were able to survive within
   A.castellanii and that this survival was reduced by Shiga toxins (Stx)
   produced by EHEC. A toxic effect mediated by Stx was demonstrated by
   amoebae mortality and LDH release during co-culture of EHEC and amoeba.
   This work describes the ability of EHEC to survive within A.castellanii,
   and this host-pathogen interaction is partially controlled by the Stx.
   Thus, this ubiquitous amoeba could represent an environmental niche for
   EHEC survival and transmission.}},

Abstract = {{During sepsis, inflammation can be orchestrated by the interaction
   between circulating and vascular cells that, under activation, release
   MPs (microparticles). Previously, we reported that increased circulating
   MPs in patients with sepsis play a pivotal role in ex vivo vascular
   function suggesting that they are protective against vascular
   hyporeactivity. The present study was designed to investigate the
   effects of MPs from patients with sepsis on the contractile response of
   TEVM (tissue-engineered vascular media). TEVM that were composed only of
   a media layer were produced by tissue engineering from human arterial
   SMCs (smooth muscle cells) isolated from umbilical cords. TEVM was
   incubated with MPs isolated from whole blood of 16 patients with sepsis.
   TEVM were incubated for 24 h with MPs and used for the study of vascular
   contraction, direct measurements of NO and O-2(-) (superoxide anion)
   production by EPR and quantification of mRNA cytokine expression. MPs
   from patients with sepsis increased contraction induced by histamine in
   TEVM. This effect was not associated with inflammation, neither linked
   to the activation of NF-kappa B (nuclear factor kappa B) pathway nor to
   the increase in iNOS (inducible NO synthase) and COX (cyclo-oxygenase)-2
   expression. In contrast, mRNA expression of IL (interleukin)-10 was
   enhanced. Then, we investigated the effect of IL-10 on vascular
   hyporeactivity induced by LPS (lipopolysaccharide). Although IL-10
   treatment did not modify the contractile response in TEVM by itself,
   this interleukin restored contraction in LPS-treated TEVM. In addition,
   IL-10 treatment both prevented vascular hyporeactivity induced by LPS
   injection in mice and improved survival of LPS-injected mice. These
   findings show an association between the capacity of MPs from patients
   with sepsis to restore vascular hyporeactivity induced by LPS and their
   ability to increase IL-10 in the tissue-engineered blood vessel model.}},

Abstract = {{Uranium (U) is an ubiquitous radioelement found in drinking water and
   food. As a consequence of its prevalence, most humans ingest a few
   micrograms (mu g) of this element daily. It is incorporated in various
   organs and tissues. Several studies have demonstrated that ingested U is
   deposited mainly in bones. Therefore, U skeletal content could be
   considered as a prime indicator for low-level chronic intake. In this
   study, 71 archived vertebrae bone samples collected in seven Canadian
   cities were subjected to digestion and U analysis by inductively coupled
   plasma mass spectrometry. These results were correlated with U
   concentrations in municipal drinking water supplies, with the data
   originating from historical studies performed by Health Canada. A strong
   relationship (r(2) = 0.97) was observed between the averaged U total
   skeletal content and averaged drinking water concentration, supporting
   the hypothesis that bones are indeed a good indicator of U intake. Using
   a PowerBASIC compiler to process an ICRP systemic model for U (ICRP,
   1995a), U total skeletal content was estimated using two
   gastrointestinal tract absorption factors (f(1) = 0.009 and 0.03).
   Comparisons between observed and modelled skeletal contents as a
   function of U intake from drinking water tend to demonstrate that
   neither of the f(1) values can adequately estimate observed values. An
   f(1) value of 0.009 provides a realistic estimate for intake resulting
   from food consumption only (6.72 mu g) compared to experimental data
   (7.4 +/- 0.8 mu g), whereas an f(1) value of 0.03 tends to better
   estimate U skeletal content at higher levels of U (1-10 mu g L-1) in
   drinking water. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   the inner surface of a nylon tube was carried out by a sequence of
   several chemical reactions to generate covalent bonds between enzymes
   and tube surface. The Bradford method and the esterase activity test
   were performed to estimate the quantities of attached and of active
   enzymes. The effect of several operational parameters like CO2 and
   unprotonated buffer concentrations and liquid velocity was studied. A
   kinetic model of the catalytic CO2 hydration by the immobilized hCA II
   was developed on the basis of a pseudo random Quad Quad Iso Ping-Pong
   mechanism. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The quality of the convergence process in genetic algorithms depends on
   the specific choice of strategies and combinations of operators. In this
   paper, we address this problem and introduce an adaptive evolutionary
   approach that uses a genetic algorithm in an adaptive process. An
   application of this approach to the dynamic vehicle routing problem with
   time windows is presented. We compare the adaptive version of a hybrid
   genetic algorithm with the non-adaptive one with respect to the
   robustness and the quality of the generated solutions. The results
   obtained show the ability of our operator combination adaptation
   approach to produce solutions that are superior to hand-tuning and other
   adaptive methods with respect to performance sensitivity and robustness.

Abstract = {{Ionic liquid self-assembled monolayers (SAM) were designed and applied
   for binding streptavidin, promoting affinity biosensing and enzyme
   activity on gold surfaces of sensors. The synthesis of
   1-((+)-biotin)pentanamido)propyl)-3-(12-mercaptododecyl)-imidazolium
   bromide, a biotinylated ionic liquid (IL-biotin), which self-assembles
   on gold film, afforded streptavidin sensing with surface plasmon
   resonance (SPR). The IL-biotin-SAM efficiently formed a full
   streptavidin monolayer. The synthesis of
   1-(carboxymethyl)-3-(mercaptododecyl)-imidazoliumbromide, a carboxylated
   IL (IL-COOH), was used to immobilize anti-IgG to create an affinity
   biosensor. The IL-COOH demonstrated efficient detection of IgG in the
   nanomolar concentration range, similar to the alkylthiols SAM and PEG.
   In addition, the IL-COOH demonstrated low fouling in crude serum, to a
   level equivalent to PEG. The IL-COOH was further modified with N,N'-bis
   (carboxymethyl)-L-lysine hydrate to bind copper ions and then, chelate
   histidine-tagged biomolecules. Human dihydrofolate reductase (hDHFR) was
   chelated to the modified IL-COOH. By monitoring enzyme activity in situ
   on the SPR sensor, it was revealed that the IL-COOH SAM improved the
   activity of hDHFR by 24\% in comparison to classical SAM. Thereby,
   IL-SAM has been synthesized and successfully applied to three important
   biosensing schemes, demonstrating the advantages of this new class of
   monolayers.}},

Abstract = {{Virulent lactococcal phages of the Siphoviridae family are responsible
   for the industrial milk fermentation failures worldwide. Lactococcus
   lactis, a Gram-positive bacterium widely used for the manufacture of
   fermented dairy products, is subjected to infections by virulent phages,
   predominantly those of the 936 group, including phage p2. Among the
   proteins coded by lactococcal phage genomes, of special interest are
   those expressed early, which are crucial to efficiently carry out the
   phage lytic cycle. We previously identified and solved the 3D structure
   of lactococcal phage p2 ORF34, a single stranded DNA binding protein
   (SSBp2). Here we investigated the molecular basis of ORF34 binding
   mechanism to DNA. DNA docking on SSBp2 and Molecular Dynamics
   simulations of the resulting complex identified R15 as a crucial residue
   for ssDNA binding. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA) and
   Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) imaging revealed the inability of the
   Arg15Ala mutant to bind ssDNA, as compared to the native protein. Since
   R15 is highly conserved among lactococcal SSBs, we propose that its role
   in the SSBp2/DNA complex stabilization might be extended to all the
   members of this protein family. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{On the use of a single-fiber multipoint plastic scintillation detector
   for Ir-192 high-dose-rate brachytherapy}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The goal of this study was to prove the feasibility of using a
   single-fiber multipoint plastic scintillation detector (mPSD) as an in
   vivo verification tool during Ir-192 high-dose-rate brachytherapy
   treatments.
   Methods: A three-point detector was built and inserted inside a
   catheter-positioning template placed in a water phantom. A hyperspectral
   approach was implemented to discriminate the different optical signals
   composing the light output at the exit of the single collection optical
   fiber. The mPSD was tested with different source-to-detector positions,
   ranging from 1 to 5 cm radially and over 10.5 cm along the longitudinal
   axis of the detector, and with various integration times. Several
   strategies for improving the accuracy of the detector were investigated.
   The device's accuracy in detecting source position was also tested.
   Results: Good agreement with the expected doses was obtained for all of
   the scintillating elements, with average relative differences from the
   expected values of 3.4 +/- 2.1\%, 3.0 +/- 0.7\%, and 4.5 +/- 1.0\% for
   scintillating elements from the distal to the proximal. A dose threshold
   of 3 cGy improved the general accuracy of the detector. An integration
   time of 3 s offered a good trade-off between precision and temporal
   resolution. Finally, the mPSD measured the radioactive source
   positioning uncertainty to be no more than 0.32 +/- 0.06 mm. The
   accuracy and precision of the detector were improved by a dose-weighted
   function combining the three measurement points and known details about
   the geometry of the detector construction.
   Conclusions: The use of a mPSD for high-dose-rate brachytherapy
   dosimetry is feasible. This detector shows great promise for development
   of in vivo applications for real-time verification of treatment
   delivery. (c) 2013 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.}},

Abstract = {{Sorption-enhanced glycerol reforming, an integrated process involving
   glycerol catalytic steam reforming and in situ CO2 removal, offers a
   promising alternative for single-stage hydrogen production with high
   purity, reducing the abundant glycerol by-product streams. This work
   investigates this process in a fixed-bed reactor, via a two-scale,
   nonisothermal, unsteady-state model, highlighting the effect of key
   operating parameters on the process performance. CO2 adsorption kinetics
   was investigated experimentally and described by a mathematical
   reaction-rate model. The integrated process presents an opportunity to
   improve the economics of green hydrogen production via an enhanced
   thermal efficiency process, the exothermic CO2 adsorption providing the
   heat to endothermic steam glycerol reforming, while reducing the capital
   cost by removing the processing steps required for subsequently CO2
   separation. The operational time of producing high-purity hydrogen can
   be enhanced by increasing the adsorbent/catalyst volume ratio, by adding
   steam to the reaction system and by increasing the inlet reactor

Abstract = {{Assessing pesticide fate in conservation agricultural systems requires a
   detailed understanding of their interaction with decomposing surface
   crop residues (mulch). Adsorption and desorption behavior of glyphosate,
   s-metolachlor and epoxiconazole was investigated on maize mulch residues
   decomposed under laboratory and field conditions. Our conceptual
   approach included characterization of chemical composition and
   hydrophobicity of mulch residues in order to generate parameters to
   predict sorption behavior. Adsorption of s-metolachlor and epoxiconazole
   greatly increased with mulch decomposition, whereas glyphosate
   adsorption was less affected but its desorption was increased. Mulch
   characteristics including aromaticity, hydrophobicity and polarity
   indices were strongly correlated to K-oc of the non-ionic pesticides. A
   predictive model based on compositional data (CoDa) analysis revealed
   that the sorption capacity of decomposing mulch can be predicted from
   descriptors such as aromatic and alkyl C corresponding respectively to
   lignin and NDF biochemical fractions. The decomposition degree of mulch
   residues should be taken into account while predicting the fate of
   pesticides. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The assessment of disturbance effects on wildlife and resulting
   mitigation efforts are founded on edge-effect theory. According to the
   classical view, the abundance of animals affected by human disturbance
   should increase monotonically with distance from disturbed areas to
   reach a maximum at remote locations. Here we show that
   distance-dependent movement taxis can skew abundance distributions
   toward disturbed areas. We develop an advection-diffusion model based on
   basic movement behavior commonly observed in animal populations and
   parameterize the model from observations on radio-collared caribou in a
   boreal ecosystem. The model predicts maximum abundance at 3.7 km from
   cutovers and roads. Consistently, aerial surveys conducted over 161,920
   km(2) showed that the relative probability of caribou occurrence
   displays nonmonotonic changes with the distance to anthropogenic
   features, with a peak occurring at 4.5 km away from these features. This
   aggregation near disturbed areas thus provides the predators of this
   top-down-controlled, threatened herbivore species with specific
   locations to concentrate their search. The edge-effect theory developed
   here thus predicts that human activities should alter animal
   distribution and food web properties differently than anticipated from
   the current paradigm. Consideration of such nonmonotonic response to
   habitat edges may become essential to successful wildlife conservation.}},

   Nernst equation. Bubbling argon into the zinc electrolyte and increasing
   the potential sweep rates from 3 to 300 mV/s did not change the shape of
   the CV diagrams. It was also found that 0.7\% silver as alloying element
   had an important influence on the reactions of Pb-Ag anodes in the zinc
   electrolyte. Lead-silver alloys were oxidized more easily in sulfuric
   acid than in the examined zinc electrolyte. The addition of MnSO4 to the
   zinc electrolyte decreased the numbers of the redox peaks on the curve

Abstract = {{Microporous and highly hydrophobic low-density polyethylene (LDPE)
   hollow fiber membranes were successfully prepared via a solvent-free
   method, combining melt-extrusion, and salt-leaching techniques. NaCl
   particles with particle size of 510 mu m were mixed with LDPE pellets to
   produce a blend of 35, 40, 50, 60, 65 and 68wt\% of salt. A microporous
   structure was produced by leaching the salt particles from the hollow
   fiber matrix via immersion in water at 60 degrees C. The fabricated
   membranes were then characterized in terms of morphology, porosity and
   pore size distribution, surface roughness, and hydrophobicity, as well
   as mechanical properties. The remarkable increase in the water contact
   angles from 98 degrees for LDPE hollow fibers fabricated without the
   addition of salt (blank sample) to 130 degrees for membranes fabricated
   with initial salt content of 68 wt\% is mainly attributed to the rough
   surface structure, comprising a large number of micropapillas produced
   by removing the imbedded salt crystals. The increase in surface
   roughness and porosity of hollow fiber membranes with increasing initial
   salt content was confirmed by scanning electron microscope and atomic
   force microscopy. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Contaminated drainage related to the leaching of soluble metals under
   near-neutral conditions, known as contaminated neutral drainage (CND),
   may arise when metal species are soluble at neutral pH. Such a
   phenomenon has been sporadically observed in effluent from the Tio mine
   waste-rock pile in Quebec, Canada, particularly from older sections of
   the pile, where Ni concentrations are increasing with time. It has been
   postulated that Ni is retained within the fresh waste rock as sorbed
   species, but as the rock ages, sorption sites become saturated and more
   Ni is released to the effluent. A field test program was initiated to
   evaluate the geochemical behavior of the waste rock. This paper presents
   a numerical analysis of CND generation from waste-rock field test cells
   including water flow and multi-component transport with geochemical
   reactions (e.g. sulfide oxidation, pH neutralization, and Ni sorption),
   using the code MIN3P. The model was able to represent the delay before
   Ni is seen in the effluent, as caused by sorption of Ni onto Fe-oxide
   particles. Once the sorption sites are saturated, the model allows Ni
   release into the effluent by millerite dissolution, expressed by the
   shrinking core model. A sensitivity analysis indicated that sorption
   parameters significantly affected the simulated results, so their
   selection should be based on sound independent field or experimental
   data. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{21}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Self-thinning-related mortality has been encountered in extensively
   cultured scallop populations. Here we report an experiment aimed at
   studying actual population dynamics of scallops undergoing self-thinning
   and develop a model of the process. Scallops were kept in small tanks at
   various initial population densities. Growth and survival were monitored
   for 39 months. Two cohorts were monitored (cohorts 1 and 2 were 1 and 2
   years old, respectively). Growth was density-dependent in cohort 2.
   Survivorship was high in cohort 1 during the first summer but mass
   mortality occurred during the second summer. Mortality in cohort 2
   peaked during the first summer. In both cohorts, peak mortality occurred
   at age 2+ years and thus was uncoupled among cohorts. Therefore,
   negative environmental factors are ruled out as explanations of
   mortality. Instead, it appears as if self-thinning interacted with some
   ontogenetic factor. Although cohort 1 was undergoing self-thinning,
   trends in biomass-density curves were non-monotonous because of mass
   mortality. In contrast, self-thinning in cohort 2 followed a classical
   pattern. One possible mechanism for such contrasting differences was
   that 1+-year-old scallops produced byssal threads and attached to one
   another during the first year, forming multilayered clumps. This
   behaviour disappeared during the second year and mass mortality was
   experienced as scallops adopted a single-layered arrangement. Although
   details may differ among species, the process depicted above provides a
   potential trigger to the sequence of events leading to mass mortality in
   scallop culture. Our model suggests that self-thinning occurred in all
   density groups, with a common slope but with different elevations in the
   biomass-density space.}},

Title = {{Spatio-temporal variability of non-regulated disinfection by-products

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{3231-3243}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{The non-regulated disinfection by-products (NrDBP) targeted in this
   study include four haloacetonitriles (trichloroacetonitrile (TCAN);
   dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN); bromochloroacetonitrile (BCAN) and
   dibromoacetonitrile (DBAN)); one halonitromethane
   (trichloronitromethane, better known under the name chloropicrin (CPK));
   and two haloketones (1,1-dichloro-2-propanone (11DCPone) and
   1,1,1-trichloro-2-propanone (111TCPone)). This study provides a detailed
   picture of the spatial and temporal variability of these NrDBP
   concentrations throughout a drinking water distribution system located
   in a region with major seasonal climate variations. The results obtained
   show that the concentrations of the investigated NrDBPs varied
   significantly according to time and location. The average concentrations
   of TCAN, DCAN, CKP and 111TCPone were significantly higher in summer.
   Surprisingly, the average concentrations of 11DCPone were significantly
   higher in winter. For BCAN and DBAN, the average concentrations observed
   in winter were higher, but not in a statistically significant way. On
   the other hand, the four HANs, CPK and 111TCPone generally had spatial
   profiles involving an increase of the concentrations along the network
   according to increasing water residence times, whereas 11DCPone overall
   had a profile where concentrations increased at the beginning of the
   network, followed by a drop in the concentrations towards the ends of
   the network. In spite of certain disparities in the individual
   spatio-temporal variation profiles, strong correlations were generally
   observed between NrDBPs, and trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids
   (HAAs). Therefore, THMs and HAAs could be good statistical indicators of
   the presence of NrDBPs in the drinking water of the system under study.

Abstract = {{LaMnO3 and LaMnO3@mSiO(2) oxygen carriers were studied in a
   mini-fluidized bed reactor for chemical looping combustion, and their
   reduction behavior was first simulated using the following two classical
   kinetic models: the nucleation and nuclei growth model (NNGM) and the
   unreacted shrinking-core model. Furthermore, another model designated as
   the oxygen ions diffusion model was derived by assuming oxygen ion
   diffusion as the rate-limiting step for the reduction of both oxygen
   carriers. These materials were characterized using XRD for phase
   identification, BET for determination of specific surface area, pore
   volume and pore size distribution, SEM and TEM for morphology, particle
   size and shell thickness determination, H-2-TPR and TPD-O-2 for oxido
   reduction properties analysis. H-2-TPR results of LaMnO3@mSiO(2) core
   shell structured material indicated that the reduction of Mn3+ into Mn2+
   is more difficult than in LaMnO3 as the low-temperature reduction peak
   was shifted to a higher temperature. Both carriers exhibited high
   reactivity toward methane combustion during repeated reduction-oxidation
   cycles. It was found that both NNGM and the shrinking-core model yielded
   poor fits of the kinetic data. The determined activation energies (E-a)
   by NNGM for reduction of LaMnO3 and LaMnO3@mSiO(2) are 23 and 57 kJ/mol,
   respectively. The higher value of E-a for LaMnO3@mSiO(2) reflects the
   increased difficulty of perovskite phase reduction which was also
   indicated by H-2-TPR results. This result was also observed using the
   oxygen ions diffusion model (diffusivity activation energy was found
   higher for LaMnO3@mSiO(2)). The diffusion coefficients of oxygen
   obtained as adjustable parameters in this case show realistic values,
   thus adding credibility to the oxygen ions diffusion model.}},

Abstract = {{This work investigates the acidification of a natural limestone source
   using citric acid in order to produce porous calcium oxide (CaO) CO2
   sorbent, with good stability in high-temperature operation. The CO2
   sorption behavior of the proposed material was studied in several
   adsorption regeneration cycles under different adsorption conditions
   (600, 650, and 700 degrees C), indicating the superior thermal stability
   and CO2 adsorption capacity of the proposed material compared to
   untreated limestone. Acidification of natural limestone results in the
   production of a calcium citrate component, which easily decomposes to
   high-purity fibrous CaO upon calcination at 850 degrees C. A novel
   technique based on a controlled atmosphere during the calcination step
   (two-step treatment) was developed to improve the activity of the CaO
   sorbent produced from the acidified precursor. A remarkable improvement
   in the adsorption activity was found for samples prepared using two-step
   calcination (initially treated in argon, followed by calcination in air)
   compared to those produced by one-step calcination. The in situ carbon
   formed during the primary calcination in an argon atmosphere was found
   to control thermal sintering and promote the dispersion of large
   agglomerates during burning off in the secondary calcination step under
   an air atmosphere. The influence of the primary calcination temperature
   was studied in detail for the acidified sorbents prepared by either one-
   or two-step calcination.}},

Abstract = {{Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy in the attenuated total
   reflectance mode (ATR) was used to characterise SiOxHy thin films
   deposited on either polypropylene foil or silicon wafers through a cold
   atmospheric plasma discharge. Compared to a classical transmission
   spectrum with transverse (TO) vibrational modes, the FTIR-ATR spectra
   revealed modified and/or exhibited additional features caused by either
   the non-orthogonal angle of incidence of the infrared radiation with
   respect to the sample normal or the partial light reflection on the
   deposition substrate. On one hand, recording the infrared spectra with
   an angle of incidence other than 90 degrees produced a longitudinal
   (perpendicular to the sample normal) component in the electric field of
   the incident light, which enabled the detection of longitudinal (LO)
   vibrational modes. On the other hand, the transverse vibrational modes
   of thin films deposited on silicon were slightly extinguished with a
   concomitant increase of the spectral intensity of the LO features, due
   to both the partial withdrawing between the incident and reflected
   electric fields of the infrared light lying in the sample plane and, the
   addition of those perpendicular to this sample plane. These data thus
   clearly show the enormous potential of FTIR-ATR to characterise thin
   film molecular order, provided that a prior comprehensive analysis is
   performed on the sampling depth and the light reflection on the
   deposition substrate. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although the influence on bacterial motility of many genetic and
   biochemical factors has been extensively studied, there have been
   limited studies of the impact of physical parameters. Indeed, despite
   the fact that natural environments are often asymmetric (such as
   stretched supramolecular structures), the majority of behavioral
   experiments with bacteria have been done in isotropic liquid solutions.
   In the present work, we show that the behavior of living microorganisms
   is dramatically different in media that are asymmetric. The example of
   Escherichia coli bacteria swimming in a bulk uniaxial liquid environment
   is used to demonstrate this phenomenon. The results of our study provide
   insight into the behavior of bacteria in conditions encountered in real
   environments and open new avenues for the control of their movements.}},

Abstract = {{A thermal circuit representation was developed to study the heat
   transfer mechanisms in the top section of an aluminum smelting pot. In
   view of thermal management and waste heat recovery applications, the
   sensitivity of the off-gas temperature and of the heat content in the
   gas with respect to several parameters was investigated. It was found
   that the draft condition was the most influential parameter.
   Additionally, the convection coefficients on the anode cover, and on the
   yoke and stubs proved to have a stronger influence on exhaust gas
   temperature, compared with the heat transfer coefficients on the hoods
   and rod. The results indicate that it is conceptually possible to
   increase both the gas temperature and the heat content, while
   maintaining at the same time the current operating conditions of the
   cell. Variations of the potroom temperature, hood insulation and anode
   height were also considered and affected significantly the gas

Abstract = {{Lactobionic acid (LBA) is a high value-added oxidation product of
   lactose with numerous potential applications in the food, pharmaceutical
   and chemical industries. This study aimed to investigate the viability
   of producing LBA from a sodium lactobionate (LBNa) solution obtained by
   the aerobic oxidation of lactose over gold nanoparticles supported on
   mesoporous silica, using a three-compartment bipolar membrane
   electrodialysis (BMED) stack with an effective area of 0.01 m(2). The
   results indicated that LBNa was continuously split in LB- (lactobionate
   anion) and Na+ ions during BMED, which formed LBA and NaOH in the acid
   and base compartments, respectively. A demineralization rate of about
   50\% was achieved after applying a voltage difference of 5.0 V during
   100 min followed by 5.5 V during 80 min, while the LBA concentration
   increased about 2.5 times in the acid compartment. The specific energy
   consumption was 0.57 kW h kg(-1) over the whole stack. Although sodium
   was found in small amounts (17.5 ppm) in the acid compartment, these
   results show for the first time the viability of producing LBA by means
   of an integral process comprising the catalytic oxidation of lactose and
   BMED, with the advantage that the NaOH could be efficiently recovered
   for its reutilization in further oxidation reactions. (c) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {{Optimal Placement of Multiple-Type FACTS Devices to Maximize Power

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{Flexible AC transmission systems, so-called FACTS devices, can help
   reduce power flow on overloaded lines, which would result in an
   increased loadability of the power system, fewer transmission line
   losses, improved stability and security and, ultimately, a more
   energy-efficient transmission system. In order to find suitable FACTS
   locations more easily and with more flexibility, this paper presents a
   graphical user interface (GUI) based on a genetic algorithm (GA) which
   is shown able to find the optimal locations and sizing parameters of
   multi-type FACTS devices in large power systems. This user-friendly
   tool, called the FACTS Placement Toolbox, allows the user to pick a
   power system network, determine the GA settings and select the number
   and types of FACTS devices to be allocated in the network. The GA-based
   optimization process is then applied to obtain optimal locations and
   ratings of the selected FACTS to maximize the system static loadability.
   Five different FACTS devices are implemented: SVC, TCSC, TCVR, TCPST and
   UPFC. The simulation results on IEEE test networks with up to 300 buses
   show that the FACTS placement toolbox is effective and flexible enough
   for analyzing a large number of scenarios with mixed types of FACTS to
   be optimally sited at multiple locations simultaneously.}},

   issues will be pointed out upon comparing classical residence time
   distribution (RTD) measurements through electrical conductivity probes
   at micro-fixed bed scale with near-wall RTD obtained via visualizations
   of dye-tracer elution and monitoring the changes in gray level intensity

   and downstream extremities of the wall regions of interest acted as
   inlet and outlet curves for the Aris method. The major outcome of this
   work was experimental confirmation of theoretically predicted maximum
   liquid velocity in the high porosity zone close to the wall. Finally,

Title = {{Controlling lateral nanomixing and velocity profile of dilute ferrofluid
   capillary flows in uniform stationary, oscillating and rotating magnetic
   fields}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{223}},
Pages = {{454-466}},

Abstract = {{The influence of magnetic-field dependent viscosity (rotational
   viscosity) on molecular transport of species in dilute ferrofluids has
   been studied. For this purpose, a Taylor dispersion test in a capillary
   tube has been performed while suspended magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs)
   are subjected to both magnetic field and low Re shear flow field. Axial
   dispersion has been quantified from residence time distributions (RTDs)
   and tracer injection tests conducted in three distinct situations where
   the capillary is subjected to (a) uniform transverse rotating magnetic
   field ((RMF)-R-T), (b) uniform transverse oscillating magnetic field
   ((OMF)-O-T), and (c) uniform axial static magnetic field ((SMF)-S-A).
   The various types of magnetic fields have been generated in a specially
   designed stator energized by three phase, AC and DC currents. Results
   obtained from the three cases are reported in terms of axial dispersion
   coefficients. For (RMF)-R-T, an increase in lateral mixing is observed
   whereas no significant effect is detected for (OME)-O-T In (SMF)-S-A,
   the lateral mixing mechanism is retarded by magnetically locked MNPs.
   Both effects under (RMF)-R-T and (SMF)-S-A reach a plateau as MNP
   concentration in the liquid is increased. These findings highlight the
   effect of rotational viscosity on diffusion of other species hosted in
   dilute ferrofluids and point to attractive applications to engineering
   fields where transport phenomena are central. Analysis of RTD
   breakthrough times enabled laminar velocity profile in capillary flow to
   be reconstructed. It suggests that (magnetic field-free) parabolic
   velocity profiles evolve towards flattened and protruded shapes,
   respectively, in (RMF)-R-T and (SMF)-S-A. These results confirm that

Abstract = {{A high-throughput, rapid, and reliable method based on laser diode
   thermal desorption (LDTD) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization
   coupled to tandem MS (APCI-MS/MS) was used to identify and quantify
   chloramphenicol (CAP) residues in honey. Sample pretreatment consisted
   of a liquid-liquid extraction of diluted honey in water with ethyl
   acetate containing stearic acid. After extraction, a 2 mu L aliquot of
   the organic phase was deposited into a 96-well plate prior to detection
   by LDTD-APCI-MS/MS. The total analysis time was less than 6 s compared
   to several minutes for traditional chromatographic methods used for CAP
   detection, since no chromatographic separation was necessary. The
   extraction and analysis were made with honey samples of different color
   grading ranging from extra white to dark amber. The method showed good
   linearity (R-2 = 0.99995) within a concentration range of 0.1 to 500
   ng/g for CAP with D-5-CAP as an internal standard. The RSD varied
   between 8 and 24\% over the calibration range (n = 4). The method LOD
   for CAP in honey was 0.19 ng/g. This work demonstrates that
   LDTD-APCI-MS/MS could be used for fast and effective quantification of
   CAP in honey samples.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of nano-particle geometry on flow and recovery of polymer
   melts based on ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) was investigated. Two
   nano-particles, calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and montmorillonite clay, were
   used with concentrations between 2.5 and 15\% by weight. First, by using
   small amplitude oscillatory shear and transient step shear tests, the
   linear and non-linear response of the nano-composites was studied. Then,
   to examine the structure recovery, the same behavior was studied on
   pre-sheared samples. The linear and non-linear data revealed that the
   effect of nano-particles in material flow is more important for
   anisometric particles which can be attributed to their ability to form a
   fractal structure controlling the rheological properties while spherical
   particles are not able to form such networks. Recovery experiments
   revealed that while nano-composites containing spherical particles have
   relatively similar response in subsequent tests, the rheological
   properties decreased significantly for platelet particles. The recovery
   results were also interpreted based on a filler-network mechanism and
   the reduction of the nano effect for anisometric particles was related
   to the breakdown of the filler network. These observations were
   validated by morphological investigations.}},

Abstract = {{One of the important objectives of supply chain S\&OP (Sales and
   Operations Planning) is the profitable alignment of customer demand with
   supply chain capabilities through the coordinated planning of sales,
   production, distribution, and procurement. In the make-to-order
   manufacturing context considered in this paper, sales plans cover both
   contract and spot sales, and procurement plans require the selection of
   supplier contracts. S\&OP decisions also involve the allocation of
   capacity to support sales plans. This article studies the coordinated
   contract selection and capacity allocation problem, in a three-tier
   manufacturing supply chain, with the objective to maximize the
   manufacturer's profitability. Using a modeling approach based on
   stochastic programming with recourse, we show how these S\&OP decisions
   can be made taking into account economic, market, supply, and system
   uncertainties. The research is based on a real business case in the
   Oriented Strand Board (OSB) industry. The computational results show
   that the proposed approach provides realistic and robust solutions. For
   the case considered, the planning method elaborated yields significant
   performance improvements over the solutions obtained from the mixed
   integer programming model previously suggested for S\&OP.}},

Abstract = {{In theory, linkages between hierarchical forest management planning
   levels ensure coherent disaggregation of long-term wood supply
   allocation as input for short-term demand-driven harvest planning. In
   practice, these linkages may be ineffective, and solutions produced may
   be incoherent in terms of volume and value-creation potential of
   harvested timber. Systematic incoherence between planned and implemented
   forest management activities may induce drift of forest system state
   (i.e., divergence of planned and actual system state trajectories), thus
   compromising credibility and performance of the forest management
   planning process. We describe hierarchical forest management from a
   game-theoretic perspective and present an iterative two-phase model
   simulating interaction between long-and short-term planning processes.
   Using an illustrative case study, we confirm the existence of a
   systematic drift effect, which we attribute to ineffective linkages
   between long-and short-term planning. In several simulated scenarios,
   the planning process fails to ensure long-term wood supply
   sustainability, fails to reliably meet industrial fiber demand over
   time, and exacerbates incoherence between wood supply and fiber demand
   over several planning iterations. We show that manipulating linkages
   between long-and short-term planning processes can reduce incoherence
   and describe future work on game-theoretic planning process model
   formulations that may improve hierarchical planning process performance.}},

Abstract = {{We have performed a series of chemodynamical simulations of barred disc
   galaxies. Our goal is to determine the physical processes responsible
   for the increase in the central gas-phase metallicity and of the central
   star formation rate (SFR) observed in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
   (SDSS). All simulations start with an axisymmetric distribution of stars
   and gas, embedded into a spherical dark matter halo. We define a 2 kpc
   diameter central aperture to approximate the integrated spectroscopic
   fibre measurements from the SDSS. The chemical evolution observed within
   this central region depends critically upon the relative size of the bar
   and the aperture, which evolves strongly with time. At t similar to
   0.5Gyr, a strong bar forms via a disc instability, whose length is
   considerably longer than the 2 kpc aperture. The stars and gas lose
   angular momentum and follow elongated orbits that cause an intense
   mixing of the gas between the central region and its surroundings.
   During the next 1.5Gyr, the orbits of the stars inside the bar do not
   evolve much, but the orbits of the gas contract significantly until the
   entire gas bar is contained in the 2 kpc aperture, resulting in a net
   flux of gas into the central region. During this period, the metallicity
   in the central region increases steadily, and this enrichment is
   dominated by metal-rich gas that is flowing into the central region. The
   main result of this work is therefore that the observed enrichment in
   the centres of barred galaxies is not dominated by in situ enrichment by
   stars formed in the centre. Rather, star formation occurs along the full
   length of the bar, much of which occurs initially outside the 2 kpc
   aperture. About 50 per cent of the metals that end up in the central
   region originate from this extended bar-long star formation, but flow
   into the central region due to loss of angular momentum. The effect is
   less significant for iron because the delay for the onset of Type Ia
   supernovae leaves less time for mixing. Still, there is a significant
   increase in {[}Fe/H] before the central stars contribute to in situ
   enrichment. Eventually, as the orbits of the gas inside the bar
   contract, they fall completely inside the central region, and only then
   the central region can be regarded as a closed-box system. However, by
   that time, most of the metal enrichment in the central region has
   already taken place. We conclude that there is no direct connection
   between central SFR and central metallicity. The central metallicity
   does not originate exclusively from central stars. Instead, the global
   SFR (especially along the bar) and the large-scale flow of enriched gas
   play a major role.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown that the observed main-sequence turnoff (MSTO)
   in colour-magnitude diagrams of intermediate-age (1-2 Gyr) clusters in
   the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is broader than would be nominally
   expected for a simple stellar population. This has led to the suggestion
   that such clusters may host multiple stellar populations, with age
   spreads of 100-500 Myr. However, at intermediate ages, spreads of this
   magnitude are difficult to discern and alternative explanations have
   been put forward (e.g. stellar rotation, interacting binaries). A
   prediction of the age-spread scenario is that younger clusters in the
   LMC, with similar masses and radii, should also show significant age
   spreads. In younger clusters (i.e. 40-300 Myr), such large age spreads
   should be readily apparent. We present an analysis of the
   colour-magnitude diagrams of two massive young clusters in the LMC (NGC
   1856 and NGC 1866) and show that neither have such large age spreads; in
   fact, both are consistent with a single burst of star formation
   {[}sigma(age) < 35 Myr]. This leads us to conclude that either the
   intermediate-age clusters in the LMC are somehow special or the
   broadened MSTOs are not due to an age spread within the clusters.}},

   MSF theory for such compositions was related to the domination of the
   linear rheological response by the presence of particle nanonetworks

Abstract = {{Wastewater discharged from cheese industries is often characterized by
   high values of organic pollutants, solids, and nutrients. An aerated
   trickling biofilter using peat and perlite as filter media was employed
   in a pilot-scale level in order to evaluate the performance of biofilter
   for removal of pollutants from cheese industry wastewater. The biofilter
   was operated for a period of 33 days under laboratory conditions, and
   several parameters were monitored. The results showed a significant
   improvement in the quality of treated effluent. The maximum removal
   efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand and biological oxygen demand were
   99.2 and 99.9\%, respectively. Significant reduction in total suspended
   solids (>96\%) was also achieved. A stable ammoniacal-nitrogen (NH4-N)
   removal was accompanied by biofilter. On an average, NH4-N and total
   nitrogen decreased by 98.7 and 72\%, respectively, with a significant
   portion of NH4-N being converted to nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N). Also, a
   molecular approach based on 16S rDNA was employed to analyze the
   bacterial community composition present in the biofilter. A comparative
   sequence analysis of excised denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis
   bands revealed the presence of diverse groups of bacteria belonging to
   alpha- and beta-Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes phylum. We conclude
   from the results that the use of trickling biofilter is highly effective
   and a potential treatment method for polishing cheese industry
   wastewater before being discharged into the local environment.}},

Abstract = {{We present the Snapshot Hubble U-band Cluster Survey (SHUCS), a project
   aimed at characterizing the star cluster populations of 10 nearby
   galaxies (d < 23 Mpc, half within approximate to 12 Mpc) through new
   F336W (U-band equivalent) imaging from Wide Field Camera 3, and archival
   BVI-equivalent data with the Hubble Space Telescope. Completing the UBVI
   baseline reduces the age-extinction degeneracy of optical colors, thus
   enabling the measurement of reliable ages and masses for the thousands
   of clusters covered by our survey. The sample consists chiefly of
   face-on spiral galaxies at low inclination, in various degrees of
   isolation (isolated, in group, merging), and includes two active
   galactic nucleus hosts. This first paper outlines the survey itself, the
   observational datasets, the analysis methods, and presents a
   proof-of-concept study of the large-scale properties and star cluster
   population of NGC 4041, a massive SAbc galaxy at a distance of
   approximate to 23 Mpc, and part of a small grouping of six giant
   members. We resolve two structural components with distinct stellar
   populations, a morphology more akin to merging and interacting systems.
   We also find strong evidence of a truncated, Schechter-type mass
   function, and a similarly segmented luminosity function. These results
   indicate that binning must erase much of the substructure present in the
   mass and luminosity functions, and might account for the conflicting
   reports on the intrinsic shape of these functions in the literature. We
   also note a tidal feature in the outskirts of the galaxy in Galaxy
   Evolution Explorer UV imaging, and follow it up with a comprehensive
   multi-wavelength study of NGC 4041 and its parent group. We deduce a
   minor merger as a likely cause of its segmented structure and the
   observed pattern of a radially decreasing star formation rate. We
   propose that combining the study of star cluster populations with
   broadband metrics is not only advantageous, but often easily achievable
   thorough archival datasets.}},

Abstract = {{Fresh blueberries are highly perishable and must be preserved by either
   freezing or drying technologies. However, moisture impermeability of
   their skin is a barrier against the moisture diffusion slowing down the
   drying process. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of
   liquid nitrogen pretreatments on osmotic dehydration kinetics of two
   blueberry species, Vaccinium corymbosum L and Vaccinium angustifolium
   Ait, and on the physicochemical quality of dehydrated fruits.
   The number of immersions in liquid nitrogen was a determinant factor
   that accelerated water loss. Depending on the blueberry species, a
   reduction of dehydration time from 45\% to 65\% was obtained for liquid
   nitrogen treated samples when compared to control blueberries.
   Microscopic observations of the blueberry skin before and after the
   liquid nitrogen pretreatment revealed a decrease of the cuticle
   thickness, dewaxing of the skin surface and the presence of
   micro-fissures facilitating moisture and sugar transfer during the
   osmotic process. The dewaxing of the blueberry skin due to liquid
   nitrogen immersions was confirmed by wax quantification before and after
   the cryogenic pretreatments. Osmotic dehydration and liquid nitrogen
   pretreatments showed a slight decrease in the levels of phenolic
   compounds and anthocyanins compared to the fresh blueberries. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Distributions of the largest fragment charge, Z(max), in
   multifragmentation reactions around the Fermi energy can be decomposed
   into a sum of a Gaussian and a Gumbel distribution, whereas at much
   higher or lower energies one or the other distribution is asymptotically
   dominant. We demonstrate the same generic behavior for the largest
   cluster size in critical aggregation models for small systems, in or out
   of equilibrium, around the critical point. By analogy with the
   time-dependent irreversible aggregation model, we infer that Z(max)
   distributions are characteristic of the multifragmentation time scale,
   which is largely determined by the onset of radial expansion in this
   energy range. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.172701}},

Title = {{Shared Decision Making Does Not Influence Physicians against Clinical
   Practice Guidelines}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: While shared decision making (SDM) and adherence to clinical
   practice guidelines (CPGs) are important, some believe they are
   incompatible. This study explored the mutual influence between
   physicians' intention to engage in SDM and their intention to follow
   CPGs.
   Methods: Embedded within a clustered randomized trial to assess the
   impact of training physicians in SDM about using antibiotics to treat
   acute respiratory tract infections, this study evaluated physicians'
   intentions to both engage in SDM and follow CPGs. A self-administered
   questionnaire based on the theory of planned behavior evaluated both
   behavioral intentions and their respective determinants (attitude,
   subjective norm and perceived behavioral control) at study entry and
   exit. We used path analysis to explore the relationships between the
   intentions. We conducted statistical analyses using the maximum
   likelihood method and the variance-covariance matrix. Goodness of fit
   indices encompassed the chi-square statistic, the comparative fit index
   and the root mean square error of approximation.
   Results: We analyzed 244 responses at entry and 236 at exit. In the
   control group, at entry we observed that physicians' intention to engage
   in SDM (r = 0, t = 0.03) did not affect their intention to follow CPGs;
   however, their intention to follow CPGs (r = -0.31 t = -2.82) did
   negatively influence their intention to engage in SDM. At exit, neither
   behavioral intention influenced the other. In the experimental group, at
   entry neither behavioral intention influenced the other; at exit, the
   intention to engage in SDM still did not influence the intention to use
   CPGs, although the intention to follow CPGs (r = -0.15 t = -2.02)
   slightly negatively influenced the intention to engage in SDM, but this
   was not clinically significant.
   Conclusion: Physicians' intention to engage in SDM does not affect their
   intention to adopt CPGs even after SDM training. Physicians' intention
   to adopt CPGs had no clinically significant influence on intention to
   engage in SDM.}},

Abstract = {{Gas-liquid mass transfer from oxygen Taylor bubbles to liquid in tube
   was studied using dilute colloidal suspensions of magnetic nanoparticles
   (MNPs) as the liquid phase. The tube was hosted inside the bore of a
   tubular two-pole three-phase magnet and the MNPs were remotely excited
   by subjecting them to different types of magnetic fields. The influence
   of magnetic field on the liquid side volumetric mass transfer
   coefficient (k(L)a) was cast as an enhancement factor with respect to
   the magnetic field free base case. The repercussions of magnetic field
   frequency, MNP concentration, tube alignment and gas velocity on this
   enhancement factor were measured experimentally. Experimental results
   suggested that spinning nanoparticles under transverse rotating magnetic
   fields (TRMF) improved mixing in the lubricating film that surrounds
   Taylor bubbles which reflected in a measurable enhancement of k(L)a. On
   the contrary, axial stationary magnetic fields (ASMF) pinned MNPs
   translating in systematically degraded gas-liquid mass transfer rates
   whereas axial oscillating magnetic field had no detectable effects on
   the mass transfer coefficient. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to evaluate the nature of the stem effect
   light produced within an optical fiber, to quantify its composition, and
   to evaluate the efficiency of the chromatic technique to remove the stem
   effect. Spectrometry studies were performed during irradiations of a
   bare PMMA optical fiber with kilovoltage x-rays from a superficial
   therapy unit, an Ir-192 high-dose-rate brachytherapy source, a Co-60
   external-therapy unit, and megavoltage electrons and x-rays from a
   linear accelerator. Stem effect spectra can be accurately modeled by a
   linear combination of the Cerenkov light and fluorescence emitted
   spectra. Fluorescence light contributes more for lower-energy
   modalities. Cerenkov light contributes more as the energy increases
   above the threshold for its production. The chromatic stem effect
   removal technique is accurate in most of the situations. However,
   noticeable differences were obtained between very specific high-energy
   irradiation conditions. It would be advantageous to implement an
   additional channel in the chromatic stem effect removal chain or
   implement a spectral approach to independently remove the Cerenkov and
   the fluorescence components from the signal of interest. This would
   increase the accuracy and versatility of the actual chromatic stem
   effect removal technique.}},

   laminar flow microreactor with HCA II immobilized on the inner surface
   of the tube, interpreting the data as a one-dimensional plug flow
   results will lead to significant error. Therefore, coupling of transport
   phenomena and surface enzymic reaction necessitates the use of a
   two-dimensional analysis. Simulations reveal that hydrodynamic and
   diffusional constraints do not permit reasonable utilization of the
   immobilized HCA II enzyme in a laminar flow microreactor, even if HCA II
   has a very high hydration turnover and the uncatalyzed bulk CO2
   hydration is the dominant process. In the microreactor with
   solution-phase HCA II enzyme ``plug flow{''} is achieved under laminar
   flow conditions and the contribution of uncatalyzed CO2 hydration
   process is not considerable. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of different Pb-Ag (0.5, 0.6 and 0.7\%) anodes during
   zinc electrowinning has been investigated in acid zinc sulphate
   electrolyte containing Mn2+ at 38 degrees C, and 50 mA cm(-2). After 24
   h of electrolysis, the polished surface of the polarised anode Pb-0.7Ag
   (wt-\%) had the lowest overpotential {[}685 mV(SHE)], followed by that
   of Pb-0.6Ag (707 mV) and finally by Pb-0.5Ag (732 mV). During the decay
   period, the corrosion potential of the Pb-0.7Ag anode reached the steady
   stationary state (298 mV) after similar to 29 h, while the potentials of
   Pb-0.6Ag (350 mV) and Pb-0.5Ag (600 mV) anodes were still unstable after
   240 h decay. It was found from electrochemical noise measurements that
   during similar to 204 h decay, the Pb-0.5Ag anode had the highest
   admittance rate `1/R-n' (proportional to corrosion rate) among the three
   anodes, followed by the anodes Pb-0.60Ag and Pb-0.70Ag. The fluctuations
   of potential time record of 0.5Ag lead anode were more frequent, smooth
   and with equal amplitudes than that of 0.7\% Ag lead, possibly due to
   the difference in the passive behaviour, quantity and adhesion of
   corrosion products. The absolute magnitudes of the power spectral
   densities `PSD' slopes of current and potential of Pb-0.5Ag anode were
   lower than that of 0.7\% Ag lead anode, indicating that the corrosion
   form was more uniform for Pb-0.5Ag anode.}},

Abstract = {{Physico-chemical and biological parameters were monitored both
   throughout different oxygen cut off and starvation (OCS) times (6h72h)
   and after the restoration of normal operational conditions. Sludge
   apparent viscosity and soluble extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)
   characteristics were measured to determine the activated sludge (AS)
   properties. Oxygen transfer, biological activity with specific oxygen
   uptake rate (SOUR) measurements during endogenous/exogenous conditions
   (without any external substrate/with external substrate consumption) and
   chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal were measured to assess the AS
   performances. During the different stress times, AS deflocculated as a
   decrease of apparent viscosity was observed and microorganisms
   biodegraded the released EPS to survive. After aeration return, and
   under endogenous conditions, size exclusion chromatographic fingerprints
   of soluble EPS were modified and macromolecules probably of type
   humic-like substances appeared in significant quantities. These new
   macromolecules presumably acted as biosurfactants. Consequently, the
   liquid surface tension, as well as the oxygen transfer rate (OTR),
   decreased. Under exogenous conditions, high biological activity ()
   compensated the decrease of oxygen transfer. Finally, AS biomass
   maintained a constant COD degradation rate before and after the
   disturbances for all times tested. This work demonstrates that AS
   microorganisms can counteract concomitant oxygen and nutrients shortage
   when the duration of such a condition does not exceed 72h. Dissociation
   of endogenous/exogenous conditions appears to offer an ideal laboratory
   model to study EPS and biomass activity effects on oxygen transfer.}},

Title = {{Integral wide-field spectroscopy in astronomy: the Imaging FTS solution}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL ASTRONOMY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{527-559}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Long-slit grating spectrometers in scanning mode and Fabry-Perot
   interferometers as tunable filters are commonly used to perform integral
   wide-field spectroscopy on extended astrophysical objects as HII regions
   and nearby galaxies. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate, by
   comparison, through a thorough review of the imaging Fourier transform
   spectrometer (IFTS) properties, that this instrument represents another
   interesting solution. After a brief recall of the performances,
   regarding FOV and spectral resolution, of the grating spectrometer,
   without and with integral field units (IFU), and of the imaging
   Fabry-Perot, it is demonstrated that for an IFTS the product of the
   maximum resolution R by the entrance beam ,tendue U is equal to with the
   number of pixels of the detector array and S the area of the
   interferometer beamsplitter. As a consequence, the IFTS offers the most
   flexible choice of field size and spectral resolution, up to high values
   for both parameters. It also presents on a wide field an important
   multichannel advantage in comparison to integral field grating
   spectrometers, even with multiple IFUs. To complete, the few
   astronomical IFTSs, built behind ground-based telescopes and in space,
   for the visible range up to the sub-millimetric domain, are presented.
   Through two wide-field IFTS projects, one in the visible, the other one
   in the mid-infrared, the question is addressed of the practical FOV and
   resolution limits, set by the optical design of the instrument, which
   can be achieved. Within the 0.3 to 2.5 m domain, a Michelson
   interferometer with wide-field diopric collimators provides the easiest
   solution. This design is illustrated by a -field IFTS in the 0.35-0.90 m
   range around an off-axis interferometer, called SITELLE, proposed for
   the 3.6-m CFH Telescope. At longer wavelengths, an all-mirror optics is
   required, as studied for a spaceborne IFTS, H2EX, for the 8-29 m range,
   a field, and a high resolution of at 10 m. To comply with these
   characteristics, the interferometer is designed with cat's eye
   retroreflectors. In the same domain and up to the far infrared, if the
   instrument aims only at a low spectral resolution (few thousands) and a
   smaller field (few arcmins), roof-top or corner cube mirrors, as for the
   IFTS SPIRE on the Herschel space telescope, are usable. At last,
   perspectives are opened, behind an ELT in the visible and the near
   infrared with the SITELLE optical combination, in the 2-5 m on the
   Antarctic plateau or in space up to longer wavelengths, with the H2EX
   design, to provide the missing capability of global high spectral
   resolution studies of extended sources, from comets to distant galaxy
   clusters.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial analog techniques consist in identifying locations whose
   historical climate is similar to the anticipated future climate at a
   reference location. In the process of identifying analogs, one key step
   is the quantification of the dissimilarity between two climates
   separated in time and space, which involves the choice of a metric. In
   this study, six a priori suitable metrics are described (the
   standardized Euclidean distance, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, the
   nearest-neighbor distance, the Zech-Aslan energy statistic, the
   Friedman-Rafsky runs statistic, and the Kullback-Leibler divergence) and
   criteria are proposed and investigated in an attempt to identify the
   best metric for selecting spatial analogs. The case study involves the
   use of numerical simulations performed with the Canadian Regional
   Climate Model (CRCM, version 4.2.3), from which three annual indicators
   (total precipitation, heating degree-days, and cooling degree-days) are
   calculated over 30-yr periods (1971-2000 and 2041-70). It is found that
   the six metrics identify comparable analog regions at a relatively large
   scale but that best analogs may differ substantially. For best analogs,
   it is shown that the uncertainty stemming from the metric choice does
   not generally exceed that stemming from the simulation or model choice.
   On the basis of the set of criteria considered in this study, the
   Zech-Aslan energy statistic stands out as the most recommended metric
   for analog studies, whereas the Friedman-Rafsky runs statistic is the
   least recommended.}},

Title = {{Uncertainty propagation of a multiscale poromechanics-hydration model
   for poroelastic properties of cement paste at early-age}},
Journal = {{PROBABILISTIC ENGINEERING MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{32}},
Pages = {{5-20}},

Abstract = {{The durability of concrete materials with regard to early-age volume
   changes and cracking phenomena depends on the evolution of the
   poroelastic properties of cement paste. The ability of engineers to
   control the uncertainty of the percolation threshold and the evolution
   of the elastic modulus, the Biot-Willis parameter and the skeleton Biot
   modulus is key for minimizing the vulnerability of concrete structures
   at early-age. This work presents original results on the uncertainty
   propagation and the sensitivity analysis of a multiscale
   poromechanics-hydration model applied to cement pastes of
   water-to-cement ratio of 0.40, 0.50 and 0.60. Notably, the proposed
   approach provides poroelastic properties required to model the behavior
   of partially saturated aging cement pastes (e.g. autogenous shrinkage)
   and it predicts the percolation threshold and undrained elastic modulus
   in good agreement with experimental data. The development of a
   stochastic metamodel using polynomial chaos expansions allows to
   propagate the uncertainties of kinetic parameters of hydration, cement
   phase composition, elastic moduli and morphological parameters of the
   microstructure. The presented results show that the propagation does not
   magnify the uncertainty of the single poroelastic properties although,
   their correlation may amplify the variability of the estimates obtained
   from poroelastic state equations. In order to reduce the uncertainty of
   the percolation threshold and that of the poroelastic properties at
   early-age, engineers need to assess more accurately the apparent
   activation energy of calcium aluminate and, later on, of the elastic
   modulus of low density calcium-silicate-hydrate. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Climate records of air temperature (AT) and total precipitation (TP) are
   standard inputs for soil carbon dynamic models, i.e., for calculating
   temperature and moisture effects on soil biological activity. In this
   study our objective was to determine both spatial and temporal
   differences in soil biological activity in the Province of Qu,bec,
   Canada. Soil biological activity was here calculated on a daily basis
   with the ICBM re\_clim parameter using data from weather stations. When
   keeping soil and crop properties constant, re\_clim (unitless) allows us
   to assess relative differences in soil biological activity. The
   magnitude of the temporal changes in re\_clim, AT and TP were analyzed
   using Sen's slope, which is a nonparametric method used to determine the
   presence of a trend component. The re\_clim varied across Qu,bec from
   0.50 (58 A degrees N) to a high of 1.66 (45 A degrees N). Considering
   only the area with significant agricultural production, re\_clim varied
   from 0.99 at Gasp, (48 A degrees N) to 1.66 at Philipsburg (45 A degrees
   N), i.e., soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition rate is 68 \% higher
   at the latter site (1.66/0.99) and correspondingly more C input is
   needed to maintain SOC. Soil biological activity increased from 1960 to
   2009, with a mean slope variation in re\_clim of about +10 \%. The
   temporal variation in AT had more influence than that of TP. For
   1980-2009 the mean annual slope of re\_clim was significantly different
   from zero for 29 out of 49 climate records (mean = +14 \%; N = 29). We
   also emphasize that analysis of seasonal changes in AT is an issue that
   needs further attention, as well as modeling climate-induced changes in
   SOC dynamics based on future climate scenarios.}},

   compatibilize the polymer phases and was also acting as an impact
   modifier, while the addition of maleated polyethylene and maleated
   polypropylene (MAPP) were acting as coupling agents between the polymer
   matrix and the wood flour. The combined effect of all the components was
   found to produce composites with interesting morphological (dispersion

Abstract = {{In this work, the combined effect of indentation damage and of
   manufacturing defects of a hybrid laminate including jute hessian cloth
   (plain weave) and hemp fibres in an epoxy matrix has been investigated.
   With this aim, various non-destructive evaluation (NDE) techniques have
   been employed, such as near-infrared (NIR) reflectography, infrared
   thermography (IRT), holographic interferometry (HI) and digital speckle
   photography (DSP). In particular, two different methods of heating were
   applied during IRT data collection: pulse thermography and square pulse
   thermography (SPT). The first one using a mid-wave infrared (IR) camera,
   while the second one using a long-wave IR camera. In the same way, two
   different cameras working into the near- and short-wave IR spectra were
   used, to compare different results from approximate to 0.74 to 14m. Data
   were processed applying principal component thermography (PCT),
   correlation and the robust second-order blind identification (SOBI-RO)
   algorithms. The latter is used for the first time to our knowledge in
   this work. The defects found were enhanced by image subtraction between
   the reflectogram and the transmittogram, distance transform and image
   fusion. In particular, data fusion from IRT and DPS images allowed
   clearly defining the extension of the indentation damage.}},

Abstract = {{Membrane bioreactors (MBR) are being increasingly used for wastewater
   treatment. Mathematical modeling of MBR systems plays a key role in
   order to better explain their characteristics. Several MBR models have
   been presented in the literature focusing on different aspects:
   biological models, models which include soluble microbial products
   (SMP), physical models able to describe the membrane fouling and
   integrated models which couple the SMP models with the physical models.
   However, only a few integrated models have been developed which take
   into account the relationships between membrane fouling and biological
   processes. With respect to biological phosphorus removal in MBR systems,
   due to the complexity of the process, practical use of the models is
   still limited. There is a vast knowledge (and consequently vast amount
   of data) on nutrient removal for conventional-activated sludge systems
   but only limited information on phosphorus removal for MBRs. Calibration
   of these complex integrated models still remains the main bottleneck to
   their employment. The paper presents an integrated mathematical model
   able to simultaneously describe biological phosphorus removal, SMP
   formation/degradation and physical processes which also include the
   removal of organic matter. The model has been calibrated with data
   collected in a UCT-MBR pilot plant, located at the Palermo wastewater
   treatment plant, applying a modified version of a recently developed
   calibration protocol. The calibrated model provides acceptable
   correspondence with experimental data and can be considered a useful
   tool for MBR design and operation.}},

Abstract = {{Fluidization processes in submarine landslides were studied by physical
   and numerical means. To examine soil-water interactions in the
   fluidization process, the computer axial tomography (CAT)-scan imaging
   techniques and laboratory vanes were utilized with a focus on the
   transition from failure to post-failure. Based on the results that were
   obtained from the scanning images and laboratory vane tests after the
   process of water infiltration into the soil sample, it appears that a
   gradual decrease in shear strength is unavoidable with increasing water
   content in a shear zone. From the numerical results, which were based on
   the dam-break problem using the transport equation coupled with the
   Navier-Stokes equation, if the slide is assumed to be initially
   unstable, a possible transition of fluidization processes that are
   dependent upon a change in density occurs. The density of the mud
   decreases with time during the flow at the interface between mud and
   water. The upper part of the mud pushes the lower part of the mud and
   then induces a rotation of mud that moves substantial distances. These
   results emphasize the importance of the soil-water interaction, the need
   for sediment rheology and the influence of the water circulation on the
   motion of the landslide.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, maleated polyethylene (MAPE) is proposed as a matrix to

   a focus on high GTR contents (50-90 wt-\%). The compounds were also
   compared with thermoplastic elastomers based on high density
   polyethylene (HDPE) as the matrix. Scanning electron microscopy images
   revealed high compatibility and very good interfacial adhesion between
   the MAPE matrix and rubber particles. Samples in the range of 50-70\% of
   GTR in MAPE showed very good tensile elongation at break and tensile
   strength, while the properties decreased for samples at higher GTR
   content. The elasticity of the thermoplastic elastomers was also
   investigated via compression set measurements. All GTR/MAPE compounds
   showed highly elastic behaviour with elasticity increasing with GTR
   content. Tensile and elastic recovery values of HDPE/GTR compounds, with
   and without MAPE coupling agent, were significantly lower than those
   based on MAPE. High stability was observed for both MAPE and HDPE based
   compounds after thermal aging at 70 degrees C. Thermal degradation was
   also characterised with respect to changes in melt viscosities.}},

Abstract = {{To adequately and permanently restore organ function after grafting,
   human tissue-engineered skin substitutes (TESs) must ultimately contain
   and preserve functional epithelial stem cells (SCs). It is therefore
   essential that a maximum of SCs be preserved during each in vitro step
   leading to the production of TESs such as the culture process and the
   elaboration of a skin cell bank by cryopreservation. To investigate the
   presence and functionality of epithelial SCs within the human TESs made
   by the self-assembly approach, slow-cycling cells were identified using
   5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) in the three-dimensional construct. A
   subset of basal epithelial cells retained the BrdU label and was
   positive for the SC-associated marker keratin 19 within TESs after a
   chase of 21 days in culture post-BrdU labeling. Moreover, keratinocytes
   harvested from TESs gave rise to SC-like colonies in secondary monolayer
   subcultures, indicating that SCs were preserved within TESs. To evaluate
   the effect of cryopreservation with dimethyl sulfoxide and storage in
   liquid nitrogen on SCs, human epithelial cells were extracted from skin
   samples, amplified in culture, and used to produce TESs, before
   cryopreservation as well as after thawing. We found that the proportion
   and the growth potential of epithelial SCs in monolayer culture and in
   TESs remained constant before and after cryopreservation. Further, the
   functionality of these substitutes was demonstrated by successfully
   grafting human TESs on athymic mice for 6 months. We conclude that human
   epithelial skin SCs are adequately preserved upon human tissue
   reconstruction. Thus, these TESs produced by the self-assembly approach
   are suitable for clinical applications.}},

Abstract = {{A procedure has been developed for the cloud point extraction (CPE) of
   uranium (VI) using H2DEH{[}MDP] (P,P-di(2-ethylhexyl)
   methanediphosphonic acid) with inductively coupled plasma coupled to
   mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The method is based on the modification of
   the cloud point temperature using cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide
   (CTAB) and Kt. Optimal conditions of extraction were found using a
   cross-optimization of every parameter (non-ionic and ionic surfactant
   concentrations, chelating agent concentration, pH and the extraction,
   and phase separation temperatures). Furthermore, the figures of merit of
   the methodology were assessed (limit of detection, limit of
   quantification, recovery, sensibility, and linear range) and are
   reported. Quantitative extraction (99 +/- 0.5\%) was obtained in
   drinking water samples over a wide range of uranium concentrations. The
   approach was also validated using drinking (SCP EP-L-3 and SCP EP-H-3),
   and wastewater (SCP EU-L-3) certified materials. Interferences from most
   critical anions and cations were evaluated to determine the reliability
   of the method. The proposed method showed robustness since its
   performance is maintained over a wide range of pH and metal ion
   concentrations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Methyltrioxorhenium impregnated on ZnCl2-modified mesoporous alumina at
   Al/Zn ratio of 8-12 was revealed as an effective catalyst for
   self-metathesis of methyloleate at mild reaction conditions.
   The use of other promoters either in form of metal chlorides or as other
   zinc halides did not promote the metathesis of methyloleate as zinc
   chloride. The enhancement of the activity was not only due to the
   chloride and/or zinc but could be attributed Lathe interaction of both
   elements as Zn-Cl or Zn-Cl-2 bonds with the mesoporous alumina.
   The results of this research suggest that it is possible to design a
   heterogeneous catalyst for the efficient and selective self-metathesis
   of functionalized olefins such as methyloleate and edible oils, avoiding
   the utilization of expensive homogeneous catalysts or use of toxic
   promoters such as SnR4 with heterogeneous catalysts. (c) 2013 Elsevier

   across Time Scales}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 29}},
Abstract = {{The large-scale use of antivirals during influenza pandemics poses a
   significant selection pressure for drug-resistant pathogens to emerge
   and spread in a population. This requires treatment strategies to
   minimize total infections as well as the emergence of resistance. Here
   we propose a mathematical model in which individuals infected with
   wild-type influenza, if treated, can develop de novo resistance and
   further spread the resistant pathogen. Our main purpose is to explore
   the impact of two important factors influencing treatment effectiveness:
   i) the relative transmissibility of the drug-resistant strain to
   wild-type, and ii) the frequency of de novo resistance. For the endemic
   scenario, we find a condition between these two parameters that
   indicates whether treatment regimes will be most beneficial at
   intermediate or more extreme values (e.g., the fraction of infected that
   are treated). Moreover, we present analytical expressions for effective
   treatment regimes and provide evidence of its applicability across a
   range of modeling scenarios: endemic behavior with deterministic
   homogeneous mixing, and single-epidemic behavior with deterministic
   homogeneous mixing and stochastic heterogeneous mixing. Therefore, our
   results provide insights for the control of drug-resistance in influenza
   across time scales.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon anode blocks, used in aluminum electrolysis cells, are usually
   baked in furnaces for several days, during which they release volatiles
   due to pitch pyrolysis. Therefore, numerical modeling of anode baking
   furnaces has to include some representation of pitch pyrolysis via a set
   of kinetic parameters. These kinetic parameters can vary with raw
   materials and baking parameters and are tedious to determine
   experimentally. In this work, we studied how the main outputs of an
   anode baking model are affected by the variance of the kinetic
   parameters. Results show that certain model outputs are not considerably
   influenced by changes in the kinetic parameters (e.g., spatial variation
   of anode porosity, maximum heating value from volatiles), while others
   are significantly affected (e.g., time evolution of anode porosity, time
   of maximum heating value of volatiles, internal pressure of anode), in
   particular by activation energy variability.}},

Title = {{Enhanced detection of hydraulically active fractures by temperature
   profiling in lined heated bedrock boreholes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{484}},
Pages = {{1-15}},
Month = {{MAR 25}},
Abstract = {{The effectiveness of borehole profiling using a temperature probe for
   identifying hydraulically active fractures in rock has improved due to
   the combination of two advances: improved temperature sensors, with
   resolution on the order of 0.001 degrees C, and temperature profiling
   within water inflated flexible impermeable liners used to temporarily
   seal boreholes from hydraulic cross-connection. The open-hole
   cross-connection effects dissipate after inflation, so that both the
   groundwater flow regime and the temperature distribution return to the
   ambient (background) condition. This paper introduces a third
   advancement: the use of an electrical heating cable that quickly
   increases the temperature of the entire static water column within the
   lined hole and thus places the entire borehole and its immediate
   vicinity into thermal disequilibrium with the broader rock mass. After
   heating for 4-6 h, profiling is conducted several times over a 24 h
   period as the temperature returns to background conditions. This
   procedure, referred to as the Active Line Source (ALS) method, offers
   two key improvements over prior methods. First, there is no depth limit
   for detection of fractures with flow. Second, both identification and
   qualitative comparison of evidence for ambient groundwater flow in
   fractures is improved throughout the entire test interval. The benefits
   of the ALS method are demonstrated by comparing results from two
   boreholes tested to depths of 90 and 120 m in a dolostone aquifer used
   for municipal water supply and in which most groundwater flow occurs in
   fractures. Temperature logging in the lined holes shows many fractures
   in the heterothermic zone both with and without heating, but only the
   ALS method shows many hydraulically active fractures in the deeper
   homothermic portion of the hole. The identification of discrete
   groundwater flow at many depths is supported by additional evidence
   concerning fracture occurrence, including continuous core visual
   inspection, acoustic televiewer logs, and tests for hydraulic
   conductivity using straddle packers as well as rock core VOC data, where
   available, that show deep penetration and many migration pathways.
   Confidence in the use of temperature profiles and the conceptual model
   is provided by numerical simulation and the demonstrated reproducibility
   of the evolution of the temperature signal measured in the lined holes
   with and without heating. This approach for using temperature profiling
   in lined holes with heating is a practical advance in fractured rock
   hydrogeology because the liners are readily available, the equipment
   needed for heating is low cost and rugged, and the time needed to obtain
   the profiles is not excessive for most projects. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{The plant ionome revisited by the nutrient balance concept}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{MAR 22}},
Abstract = {{Tissue analysis is commonly used in ecology and agronomy to portray
   plant nutrient signatures. Nutrient concentration data, or ionomes,
   belong to the compositional data class, i.e., multivariate data that are
   proportions of some whole, hence carrying important numerical
   properties. Statistics computed across raw or ordinary log-transformed
   nutrient data are intrinsically biased, hence possibly leading to wrong
   inferences. Our objective was to present a sound and robust approach
   based on a novel nutrient balance concept to classify plant ionomes. We
   analyzed leaf N, R K, Ca, and Mg of two wild and six domesticated fruit
   species from Canada, Brazil, and New Zealand sampled during reproductive
   stages. Nutrient concentrations were (1) analyzed without
   transformation, (2) ordinary log-transformed as commonly but incorrectly
   applied in practice, (3) additive log-ratio (air) transformed as
   surrogate to stoichiometric rules, and (4) converted to isometric
   log-ratios OH arranged as sound nutrient balance variables. Raw
   concentration and ordinary log transformation both led to biased
   multivariate analysis due to redundancy between interacting nutrients.
   The air- and ilr-transformed data provided unbiased discriminant
   analyses of plant ionomes, where wild and domesticated species formed
   distinct groups and the ionomes of species and cultivars were
   differentiated without numerical bias. The ilr nutrient balance concept
   is preferable to air, because the ilr technique projects the most
   important interactions between nutrients into a convenient Euclidean
   space.This novel numerical approach allows rectifying historical biases
   and supervising phenotypic plasticity in plant nutrition studies.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of imitation learning when the examples,
   provided by an expert human, are scarce. Apprenticeship learning via
   inverse reinforcement learning provides an efficient tool for
   generalizing the examples, based on the assumption that the expert's
   policy maximizes a value function, which is a linear combination of
   state and action features. Most apprenticeship learning algorithms use
   only simple empirical averages of the features in the demonstrations as
   a statistics of the expert's policy. However, this method is efficient
   only when the number of examples is sufficiently large to cover most of
   the states, or the dynamics of the system is nearly deterministic. In
   this paper, we show that the quality of the learned policies is
   sensitive to the error in estimating the averages of the features when
   the dynamics of the system is stochastic. To reduce this error, we
   introduce two new approaches for bootstrapping the demonstrations by
   assuming that the expert is near-optimal and the dynamics of the system
   is known. In the first approach, the expert's examples are used to learn
   a reward function and to generate furthermore examples from the
   corresponding optimal policy. The second approach uses a transfer
   technique, known as graph homomorphism, in order to generalize the
   expert's actions to unvisited regions of the state space. Empirical
   results on simulated robot navigation problems show that our approach is
   able to learn sufficiently good policies from a significantly small
   number of examples. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ceria nanoparticles were synthesized from reaction mixture of cerium
   nitrate/hexamethylenediamine/water-ethylene glycol. Lamellar,
   particle-aggregated array, platelet, rice, cube, quasi-sphere shapes of
   the ceria nanoparticles can be controlled by tuning reaction parameters
   (reagent concentration, reagent components, pH, and reaction
   conditions). Studies on shape-dependent catalysis of the bare ceria
   samples toward CO oxidation indicated that the cube-shaped ceria
   nanoparticles show better catalytic activity than the nanospheres and
   the commercial micropowders. As capped by hexamethylenediamine (HEA)
   molecules, amine-functionalized ceria nanoparticles act as platforms for
   depositing copper particles to produce efficient Cu/CeO2 hybrid
   nanocatalysts for CO conversion. Coupling of the copper clusters with
   the HEA-capped ceria nanocubes was achieved with the Cu contents up to
   15 wt.\%. The Cu/CeO2 nanohybrids show an enhanced catalytic efficiency
   of low temperature CO conversion. This could be due to high exposure of
   the reactive (100) facets in the ceria nanocubes and interfacial
   copper-ceria interactions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Uniaxial deformation of amorphous L-polylactic acid films was performed
   at two different temperatures at which thermal degradation was minimal,
   70 degrees C or Tg + 10 and 90 degrees C or Tg + 30. Samples were
   annealed postdeformation for long times (either 15 or 45 min) to
   approach equilibrium conditions. Samples deformed and annealed at 70
   degrees C showed low crystallinity and poor crystalline order or crystal
   size, as determined by wide-angle X-ray diffraction. At 90 degrees C,
   high crystallinity and order parameters were observed. In addition, once
   the oriented chains had crystallized at this temperature, nonoriented
   chains also underwent crystallization, and a small fraction of
   nonordered crystal phase was therefore observed after long annealing
   times. These observations are explained on the basis of different
   morphologies in samples drawn at the two temperatures. (c) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {{Our investigations of silver selenide colloidal quantum dots, emitting
   in the biologically important near-infrared region, demonstrate the
   size-dependence of their optical properties. Ag2Se nanocrystals were
   prepared in the orthorhombic phase with their average radius varying
   from 0.95 to 4.7 nm as observed by transmission electron microscopy. The
   high purity of the samples, established by energy-dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, allowed for the accurate
   determination of the Ag2Se content of colloidal suspensions by a
   thermogravimetric method. The energy of the first observed transition is
   found to decrease asymptotically with colloidal quantum dot size,
   tending toward a value of 1.1 eV, a value significantly above the
   beta-Ag2Se bulk bandgap. Furthermore, the molar extinction coefficient
   of this absorption is proportional to r(0)(2.7 +/- 0.2), where r(0) is
   the cQD radius. At higher energies, the extinction coefficient
   eventually follows the classically predicted cubic power law with r(0).}},

Title = {{Learning a peptide-protein binding affinity predictor with kernel ridge
   regression}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{MAR 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: The cellular function of a vast majority of proteins is
   performed through physical interactions with other biomolecules, which,
   most of the time, are other proteins. Peptides represent templates of
   choice for mimicking a secondary structure in order to modulate
   protein-protein interaction. They are thus an interesting class of
   therapeutics since they also display strong activity, high selectivity,
   low toxicity and few drug-drug interactions. Furthermore, predicting
   peptides that would bind to a specific MHC alleles would be of
   tremendous benefit to improve vaccine based therapy and possibly
   generate antibodies with greater affinity. Modern computational methods
   have the potential to accelerate and lower the cost of drug and vaccine
   discovery by selecting potential compounds for testing in silico prior
   to biological validation.
   Results: We propose a specialized string kernel for small bio-molecules,
   peptides and pseudo-sequences of binding interfaces. The kernel
   incorporates physico-chemical properties of amino acids and elegantly
   generalizes eight kernels, comprised of the Oligo, the Weighted Degree,
   the Blended Spectrum, and the Radial Basis Function. We provide a low
   complexity dynamic programming algorithm for the exact computation of
   the kernel and a linear time algorithm for it's approximation. Combined
   with kernel ridge regression and SupCK, a novel binding pocket kernel,
   the proposed kernel yields biologically relevant and good prediction
   accuracy on the PepX database. For the first time, a machine learning
   predictor is capable of predicting the binding affinity of any peptide
   to any protein with reasonable accuracy. The method was also applied to
   both single-target and pan-specific Major Histocompatibility Complex
   class II benchmark datasets and three Quantitative Structure Affinity
   Model benchmark datasets.
   Conclusion: On all benchmarks, our method significantly (p-value <=
   0.057) outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods at predicting
   peptide-protein binding affinities. The proposed approach is flexible
   and can be applied to predict any quantitative biological activity.
   Moreover, generating reliable peptide-protein binding affinities will
   also improve system biology modelling of interaction pathways. Lastly,
   the method should be of value to a large segment of the research
   community with the potential to accelerate the discovery of
   peptide-based drugs and facilitate vaccine development. The proposed
   kernel is freely available at

Abstract = {{The objective of the paper is to analyze the effect of substrate
   roughness and superficial microcraking upon adhesion of repair systems
   using concrete surface engineering approach. The results presented in
   this paper have been obtained within the framework of research projects
   performed to develop a better understanding of the factors affecting the
   adhesion of repair materials through a surface engineering approach.
   Based on the results of investigations, the authors showed that the
   durability and quality of concrete repairs depend to a large degree on
   the characteristics of the substrate. Mechanical preparation and
   profiling of the concrete surface to be repaired has to be balanced with
   potential co-lateral effects such as superficial cracking, too often
   induced as a result of inappropriate concrete removal method selection,
   and the loss of benefits due to better mechanical anchorage. The results
   obtained confirm also that Concrete Surface Engineering, as a scientific
   concept, will definitely contribute to shed more light on how to
   optimize repair bond, taking into account interactions between the
   materials at different observation scales.}},

Abstract = {{Fertilizer recommendations for cranberry crops are guided by plant and
   soil tests. However, critical tissue concentration ranges used for
   diagnostic purposes are inherently biased by nutrient interactions and
   physiological age. Compositional data analysis using isometric log
   ratios (ilr) of nutrients as well as time detrending can avoid numerical
   biases. The objective was to derive unbiased nutrient signature
   standards for cranberry in Quebec and compare those standards to
   literature data. Field trials were conducted during 3 consecutive years
   with varying P treatments at six commercial sites in Quebec. Leaf
   tissues were analyzed for N, P, K, Ca, Mg, B, Cu, Zn, Mn and Fe. The
   analytical results were transformed into ilr nutrient balances of parts
   and groups of parts. High-yield reference ilr values were computed for
   cranberry yielding greater than 35 Mg ha(-1). Many cranberry fields
   appeared to be over-supplied with K and either under-supplied with Mn or
   over-supplied with Fe as shown by their imbalanced {[}K vertical bar Ca,
   Mg] and {[}Mn vertical bar Fe] ratios. Nutrient concentration ranges
   from Maine and Wisconsin, USA, were combined into ilr values to generate
   ranges of balances. It was found that these nutrient ranges were much
   too broad for application in Quebec or outside the Quebec ranges for the
   {[}Ca vertical bar Mg] and the {[}Mn vertical bar Fe] balances, that
   were lower compared to those of high yielding cranberry crops in Quebec.}},

Abstract = {{Stainless steel is increasingly used in a number of structural
   applications and less considered an exotic solution to structural
   engineering problems. A paradigm shift towards life-cycle costing and
   sustainable development, as well as superior mechanical, thermal and
   physical characteristics are often cited as the dominant driving force.
   While significant progress has been made around the world, particularly
   over the last two decades, in structural stainless steel research,
   design methods are largely based on those of the well-known carbon
   steels. Although there is increased understanding of the material's
   unique mechanical behaviour and structural characteristics, on-going
   research efforts seek to fully maximise the desirable properties of the
   material to improve on structural design and performance. It is also
   expected to facilitate its wider structural applications, making it a
   structural material of choice. This paper addresses a broad range of
   fundamental issues affecting material behaviour, design requirements,
   fabrication, erection and research development of stainless steels in
   structural applications, and brings together a number of useful leads
   for both researchers and practitioners. It also assesses the relevance
   of design and fabrication procedures customary to carbon steels.}},

Title = {{The Population and Evolutionary Dynamics of Phage and Bacteria with
   CRISPR-Mediated Immunity}},
Journal = {{PLOS GENETICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR),
   together with associated genes (cas), form the CRISPR-cas adaptive
   immune system, which can provide resistance to viruses and plasmids in
   bacteria and archaea. Here, we use mathematical models, population
   dynamic experiments, and DNA sequence analyses to investigate the
   host-phage interactions in a model CRISPR-cas system, Streptococcus
   thermophilus DGCC7710 and its virulent phage 2972. At the molecular
   level, the bacteriophage-immune mutant bacteria (BIMs) and CRISPR-escape
   mutant phage (CEMs) obtained in this study are consistent with those
   anticipated from an iterative model of this adaptive immune system:
   resistance by the addition of novel spacers and phage evasion of
   resistance by mutation in matching sequences or flanking motifs. While
   CRISPR BIMs were readily isolated and CEMs generated at high rates
   (frequencies in excess of 10(-6)), our population studies indicate that
   there is more to the dynamics of phage-host interactions and the
   establishment of a BIM-CEM arms race than predicted from existing
   assumptions about phage infection and CRISPR-cas immunity. Among the
   unanticipated observations are: (i) the invasion of phage into
   populations of BIMs resistant by the acquisition of one (but not two)
   spacers, (ii) the survival of sensitive bacteria despite the presence of
   high densities of phage, and (iii) the maintenance of phage-limited
   communities due to the failure of even two-spacer BIMs to become
   established in populations with wild-type bacteria and phage. We
   attribute (i) to incomplete resistance of single-spacer BIMs. Based on
   the results of additional modeling and experiments, we postulate that
   (ii) and (iii) can be attributed to the phage infection-associated
   production of enzymes or other compounds that induce phenotypic phage
   resistance in sensitive bacteria and kill resistant BIMs. We present
   evidence in support of these hypotheses and discuss the implications of
   these results for the ecology and (co)evolution of bacteria and phage.}},

Abstract = {{Land application of residuals from the forest industry can help to
   restore soil fertility, but few studies have assessed the effects of
   metal accumulation in plants. An experimental study was initiated in
   2000 on a loamy soil at Yamachiche, QC, Canada, to evaluate the effects
   of repeated annual applications of combined paper mill biosolids, when
   applied alone or with several liming by-products. This study assessed
   the accumulation of Cu, Zn, Mo, and Cd in plants and soil aft er 6
   (soybean {[}Glycine max (L.) Merr.]) and 9 {[}corn (Zea mays L.)] crop
   yr. Wet paper mill biosolids at 0, 30, 60, or 90 Mg ha(-1) were surface
   applied aft er seeding. Calcitic lime, lime mud, and wood ash were
   applied wet each at 3 Mg ha(-1) with 30 Mg wet paper mill biosolids
   ha(-1). Repeated applications of paper mill biosolids increased plant
   and soil metal concentrations aft er 6 and 9 yr in the order of Cd > Mo
   (soybean) > Zn > Cu. Liming increased soil pH and Mo availability and
   decreased Zn and Cd availability. Metals in crop stover responded more
   positively to applications than those in grains, but the concentrations
   in plant tissues were generally well below critical values. The Cu/Mo
   ratio of soybean plants at pH > 6.8 fell below 2:1, however, and may
   pose a risk for inducing Cu metabolism disorder in ruminants. Results of
   this study indicate that paper mill biosolids and alkaline residuals,
   when applied with respect to regulations and soil pH, have a limited
   effect on metal accumulation in plants and soil.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new dry die-sinking EDM polishing method using a
   mouldable polymer composite electrode as tool is presented. This EDM
   method involves two new concepts, namely: dry die sinking and the
   polymer composite tool. An experimental investigation was performed on
   the dry die-sinking EDM process to assess the feasibility of finishing
   down to 0.2-0.3 mu m Sa, and polishing from 0.2 to 0.3 mu m Sa down to
   the finest achievable surface finish. To simplify sample preparation,
   the methodology involved a reversal of the polishing process. Hence, the
   surface finish of a 13-mm diameter P20 tool steel disk was taken from a
   lapped 0.01-mu m Sa surface finish up to a rougher steady-state surface
   finish value, assuming comparable results with conventional
   rough-to-fine polishing procedures. Several process parameters were
   evaluated such as: pulse current level I (EP), open-circuit voltage V
   (OC), pulse time on T (ON), pulse time off T (OFF), number of polishing
   cycles N (C) and three pulse identification methods, for their effect on
   sample surface finish micrometre Sa, material removal rate MRR {[}cubic
   millimetre per hour] and electrode relative wear rate ERWR.}},

Abstract = {{Endotoxins are lipopolysaccharides found in the outer membrane of most
   Gram-negative bacteria and cyanobacteria. Worker exposure to endotoxins
   has been shown in a number of work situations and is associated with
   both respiratory and systemic pathologies. The lack of an occupational
   exposure limit is mainly due to the absence of a standard protocol at
   the international level for sampling and analyzing airborne endotoxins.
   The bibliographic review in this article takes an exhaustive look at the
   current knowledge on measuring airborne endotoxins. It shows that,
   despite several reference documents at the international level, the
   methods used to measure endotoxin exposure differ considerably from one
   laboratory to another. Standardization is necessary to reduce
   interlaboratory variability and, ultimately, to improve the use of
   interstudy data. The bibliographic review presents the current status of
   standardization for airborne endotoxin measurement methods in the
   workplace and summarizes areas for further research. This article is
   both a reference document for all operators wishing to use such methods
   and a working document to build international consensus around the
   measurement of airborne endotoxins.}},

Abstract = {{Inorganic hybrid nanostructures containing two or more nanocomponents
   have been emerging in many areas of materials science in recent years.
   The particle-particle interactions in a hybrid particle system could
   significantly improve existing local electronic structure and induce
   tunable physiochemical responses. The current work reviews the diverse
   inorganic hybrid nanostructures formed by adhesion of the different
   single components via seed-mediated method. The hybrid nanomaterials
   have great potentials for real applications in many other fields. The
   nanohybrids have been used as efficient heterocatalysts for carbon
   monoxide conversion and photodegradation of organic contaminants. The
   enhanced catalytic activity of these hybrid nanocatalysts could be
   attributed the formation of oxygen vacancies and electron transfer
   across the structural junction in a hybrid system as a result of the
   interfacial particle-particle interactions. The synergistic combination
   of up-converting and semiconducting properties in an up-converting
   semiconducting hybrid particle results in appearance of sub-band-gap
   photoconductivity. This behavior has a great significance for the design
   of photovoltaic devices for effective solar energy conversion. The
   functionalization and subsequent bioconjugation of the hybrid
   nanostructures to afford the multifunctional nanomedical platforms for
   simultaneous diagnosis and therapy are reviewed. The conjugated
   multifunctional hybrid nanostructures exhibit high biocompatibility and
   highly selective binding with functional groups-fabricated alive organs
   through delivering them to the tumor sites. The clever combinations of
   multifunctional features and antibody conjugation within these vehicles

Title = {{Evaluation of Concrete Distributed Cracks by Ultrasonic Travel Time
   Shift Under an External Mechanical Perturbation: Study of Indirect and

Abstract = {{Techniques based on non-linear acoustics have been proven sensitive to
   micro-defects in heterogeneous materials, such as concrete, but their
   implementation on-site is very restrictive. Ultrasonic travel time
   shift, a technique where a high frequency ultrasonic wave probes the
   medium while a low frequency elastic wave disturbs it to create a ``time
   delay{''}, is a new promising technique that may be used efficiently
   on-site. This technique is based on nonlinear behaviour of concrete.
   Moreover, this technique offers the possibility of evaluating linear
   parameter, such as ultrasonic pulse velocity of direct waves. The scope
   of this paper is to study the applicability of the technique at
   different level of concrete damage and define its advantages,
   limitations in order to optimize its use.
   Because of the large dimensions, the geometry and limited access to
   various faces of existing structures, the transducers often have to be
   set on the same side. Two types of configurations, the indirect
   transmission (with incident waves at 90(a similar to)) and the
   semi-direct transmission (with incident waves at 45(a similar to)), were
   studied with cement base samples at different levels of damage
   (generated by freeze-thaw cycles). Up to now, test results have shown
   that time-shift is more sensitive when used in an indirect configuration
   of transmission rather than in a semi-direct configuration. Overall, the
   non-linear time-shift technique is much more sensitive to the initiation
   of cracking than linear indicators and its versatility (different
   indicators for different levels of damage) is of interest for rapid
   testing of structures.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes a novel separation scheme developed for an
   automated system to efficiently separate actinides in individual
   fractions. The automated pressurized injection (PI) system developed
   allows precise collection of high-purity actinide fractions (>= 99 \%)
   at elevated flow rates (15-30 mL min(-1)) using two extraction
   chromatographic TEVA and DGA resins. This system is sufficiently robust
   to enable the use of highly viscous acid media, limit acid corrosion,
   and tolerate large amount of gases generated by redox reactions by some
   of the reagents. The PI system was successfully applied to the
   separation of actinides in individual fractions (recovery yield >= 97 \%
   for Th, U, Np, Pu, and Am) and shows the absence of cross contamination
   even with highly concentrated actinide solutions. The methodology was
   also applied to the measurement of actinides in large spiked soil
   samples.}},

Abstract = {{Intimal hyperplasia and thrombosis are responsible for the poor patency
   rates of small-diameter vascular grafts. These complications could be
   avoided by a rapid and strong adhesion of endothelial cells to the
   prosthetic surfaces, which typically consist of expanded
   polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) for small-diameter vessels. We have
   previously described two peptide micropatterning strategies that
   increase the endothelialization rates of PTFE. The micropatterns were
   generated either by inkjet printing 300 mu m squares or by spraying 10.1
   +/- 0.1 mu m diameter droplets of the CGRGDS cell adhesion peptide,
   while the remaining surface was functionalized using the CWQPPRARI cell
   migration peptide. We now directly compare these two micropatterning
   strategies and examine the effect of hydrodynamic stress on human
   saphenous vein endothelial cells grown on the patterned surfaces. No
   significant differences in cell adhesion were observed between the two
   micropatterning methods. When compared to unpatterned surfaces treated
   with a uniform mixture of the two peptides, the cell expansion was
   significantly higher on sprayed or printed surfaces after 9 days of
   static cell culture. In addition, after 6 h of exposure to hydrodynamic
   stress, the cell retention and cell cytoskeleton reorganization on the
   patterned surfaces was improved when compared to untreated or random
   treated surfaces. These results indicate that micropatterned surfaces
   lead to improved rates of PTFE endothelialization with higher resistance
   to hydrodynamic stress. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater

Abstract = {{This work describes the first hydrothermal synthesis in fluoride medium
   of Ni-Al montmorillonite-like phyllosilicates, in which the only
   metallic elements in the octahedral sheet are Ni and Al. X-ray
   diffraction, chemical analysis, thermogravimetric and differential
   thermal analysis, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron
   microscopy confirm that the synthesized samples are montmorillonite-like
   phyllosilicates having the expected chemical composition. The specific
   surface areas of the samples are relatively large (>100 m(2) g(-1))
   compared to naturally occurring montmorillonites. Si-29 and Al-27
   nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) indicate substitutions of Al for Si in
   the tetrahedral sheet. F-19 NMR and Ni K-edge extended X-ray absorption
   fine structure (EXAFS) local probes highlight a clustering of the metal
   elements and of the vacancies in the octahedral sheet of the samples.
   These Ni-Al phyllosilicates exhibit a higher local order than in
   previously synthesized Zn-Al phyllosilicates. Unlike natural
   montmorillonites, where the distribution of transition metal cations
   ensures a charge equilibrium allowing a stability of the framework,
   synthetic montmorillonites entail clustering and instability of lattice
   when the content of divalent element in the octahedral sheet exceeds ca.
   20\%. Synthesis of Ni-Al montmorillonite-like phyllosilicates, was
   successfully achieved for the first time. These new synthetic materials
   may find potential applications as catalysts or as materials with
   magnetic, optical or staining properties.}},

   out to assess the phase formation in Al-7Si-(0-1)Ni-0.5Cu-0.35Mg alloys
   (in wt.\%) under equilibrium and non-equilibrium (Scheil cooling)
   conditions. Calculations showed that the T-Al9FeNi, gamma-Al7Cu4Ni,
   delta-Al3CuNi and epsilon-Al3Ni phases are formed at different Ni
   levels. By analyzing the calculated isothermal sections of the phase
   diagrams it was revealed that the Ni:Cu and Ni:Fe ratios control
   precipitation in this alloy system. In order to verify the simulation
   results, microstructural investigations in as-cast, solution treated and
   aged conditions were carried out using electron probe microanalysis
   (EPMA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Furthermore, cooling curve
   analysis (CCA) was also performed to determine the freezing range of the
   new alloys and porosity formation during solidification. Hardness
   measurements of the overaged samples showed that in this alloy system
   the delta-Al3CuNi phase has a greater influence on the overall strength
   of the alloys compared to the other Ni-bearing precipitates. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of a trickle bed reactor
   under gas, liquid, and gas/liquid alternating cyclic operations have
   been performed by using an unsteady multiple-Euler framework by means of
   the commercial software FLUENT. Electrical capacitance tomography (ECT)
   imaging was applied to track the liquid holdup waves along the bed and
   to validate the CFD simulation results. Comprehensive simulations were
   conducted to examine the effects of reactor geometry meshing (i.e., one,
   two, or three-dimensional), domain initialization, numerical schemes
   (i.e., 1st and 2nd order upwind or 3rd order MUSCL), drag forces,
   constant coefficients of drag force terms (i.e., Ergun constants), gas
   and liquid properties and particle size. The important outcome of this
   work was that a one-dimensional multiple-Euler CFD model with first
   order numerical scheme was sufficient to accurately capture the
   non-steady state hydrodynamic behavior of trickle bed reactors under
   different cyclic operation strategies. This indicates that the alignment
   of flow and mesh practically eliminates (or minimizes) the numerical
   diffusion. Moreover, application of uniform bed porosity can predict the
   hydrodynamics parameters under cyclic operations. The model was able to
   predict accurately the morphological (i.e., the details of rise and
   falling or breakthrough and tail as well as plateau) characteristics of
   a liquid wave inside the bed for all the examined cyclic strategies,
   including base-peak and ON-OFF modes. In addition, simulation results
   were in excellent consistency with experimental data in terms of both
   value and behavior (i.e., fluctuations) of overall bed pressure drop. It
   was found that the liquid-solid drag force is the main cause of wave
   attenuation along the bed. The performed case studies with the CFD model
   revealed the significance of different parameters (e.g., Ergun
   constants, gas and liquid properties, packing size). (c) 2012 Elsevier

Pages = {{993-1005}},

Abstract = {{In this article we propose an accelerated scenario updating heuristic to
   solve a real-world large-scale multi-stage stochastic mixed-integer
   model. Motivated from challenges we are facing in sawmills, the model
   corresponds to multi-period, multi-product production planning including
   setup constraints, with random yield and demand. While addressing
   real-life size instances of the problem, the resulting large-scale
   multi-stage stochastic mixed-integer model cannot be solved by
   commercial optimisation packages. Moreover, as the production planning
   model is a mixed-integer program without any special structure,
   developing decomposition and cutting plane algorithms to obtain good
   approximate solutions in reasonable time is not straightforward. We
   propose a successive approximation heuristic inspired from scenario
   updating heuristic which has been proposed for multi-stage stochastic
   models with partial recourse. The latter solves the problem by
   considering only a subset of scenarios which is updated at each
   iteration. We modify the scenario updating heuristic in two directions:
   (1) we modify the bounds on the optimal solution so as to make them
   valid for multi-stage stochastic models with full recourse, and (2) we
   propose a new scenario selection rule so as to increase the rate of
   convergence and the quality of solution. Computational experiments for a
   real-world large-scale sawmill production planning model verify the
   effectiveness of the proposed solution strategy in finding quickly good
   approximate solutions.}},

Title = {{ON THE ORIGIN OF MASS SEGREGATION IN NGC 3603}},
Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{764}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{We present deep Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2
   photometry of the young HD 97950 star cluster in the giant HII region
   NGC 3603. The data were obtained in 1997 and 2007 permitting us to
   derive membership based on proper motions of the stars. Our data are
   consistent with an age of 1 Myr for the HD 97950 cluster. A possible age
   spread, if present in the cluster, appears to be small. The global slope
   of the incompleteness-corrected mass function for member stars within 60
   `' is Gamma = -0.88 +/- 0.15, which is flatter than the value of a
   Salpeter slope of -1.35. The radially varying mass function shows
   pronounced mass segregation ranging from slopes of -0.26 +/- 0.32 in the
   inner 5 `' to -0.94 +/- 0.36 in the outermost annulus (40 `'-60 `').
   Stars more massive than 50 M-circle dot are found only in the cluster
   center. The Lambda minimum spanning tree technique confirms significant
   mass segregation down to 30M(circle times). The dependence of Lambda on
   mass, i.e., that high-mass stars are more segregated than low-mass
   stars, and the (weak) dependence of the velocity dispersion on stellar
   mass might imply that the mass segregation is dynamical in origin. While
   primordial segregation cannot be excluded, the properties of the mass
   segregation indicate that dynamical mass segregation may have been the
   dominant process for segregation of high-mass stars.}},

Abstract = {{Leaf area index (LAI) is a key input for many ecological models such as
   crop and carbon and nitrogen models. The LAI patterns measured in situ
   are time consuming and expensive and could be substituted by remote
   sensing technology. The objective of this study was to evaluate the
   possibility to map LAI of corn fields in eastern Canada using airborne
   multispectral imagery. Four models were locally optimized, tested, and
   compared. The first two methodologies relied on simple empirical
   relationships between LAI and the normalized difference vegetation
   index. The third methodology was a physically based model assuming that
   spectral vegetation indices are proportional to the fraction of
   photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the green vegetation
   canopy. The last methodology relied on neural network (NN) models using
   different channels of the multispectral images as input. No studies
   combining airborne remote sensed data and NN for corn LAI simulation at
   regional or field scales are known by the authors. Ground measurements
   of LAI in five experimental sites at two dates in 2011 and 2012 were
   used to optimize and evaluate the models. Even though performances of
   the standard methods were improved by local optimisation, an NN model
   built with the near-infrared and red channels provided more accurate LAI
   simulations. All models performed better at LAI values below 3, but
   scattering at high LAI values was less pronounced with the NN model.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents an approach to investigate unsaturated water flow

   simulations with stochastically distributed material properties. The
   water retention curve and hydraulic conductivity function are used to
   represent spatial variability for water flow, while distributed
   geochemical parameters are used for reactive transport. The results
   illustrate how the spatial correlation of hydraulic properties affects
   the moisture distribution and flow within the pile, which in some cases
   creates local preferential flow paths. The numerical simulations also
   show how sulphide mineral oxidation rates can be influenced by the grain
   size, sulphide fraction and moisture content distribution, which may
   explain the large spatial variations observed in the composition of
   drainage water. Such simulations help to better understand the long-term
   response of a typical waste rock pile.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal conductivity of bitumen concrete is a key parameter in the
   thermal analysis of pavements submitted to widely varying climate
   conditions. This paper presents the experimental results of thermal
   conductivity of bitumen concrete typically used in the Province of
   Quebec. The results show that the thermal conductivity of bitumen
   concrete is dependent on the aggregate's mineral origin and on the
   amount of air voids. It is also shown that the presence of bitumen
   increases thermal conductivity compared to unbound aggregates. The paper
   demonstrates that the effect of bitumen creates thermal bridges between
   aggregate particles similarly to other types of binders such as Portland
   cement and natural binders found in sedimentary rocks. Based on these
   observations and on the analyses of over 80 data sets from the
   literature, an existing model is used to develop a simplified thermal
   conductivity equation to estimate this parameter for bitumen concrete.}},

Abstract = {{The use of recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) aggregates as replacement for
   new materials in the pavement base weakens the layer in regards to the
   resistance to permanent deformation under repeated loading. A
   mechanistic based design procedure is proposed to ensure that base
   layers containing RAP particles have a similar rutting behaviour to base
   layers made of virgin aggregates. The design procedure allows
   calculating an asphalt concrete thickness increase that is based on
   permanent deformation behaviour of base materials. The calculation
   approach is based on multistage triaxial permanent deformation tests
   performed on granular material samples with varied RAP content. The
   tests allowed proposing an equation that relates permanent strain rate,
   RAP content, and deviatoric stress, which is the basis of the design
   procedure. Design charts are proposed to select adequate thickness
   increase for the asphalt concrete layer according to the expected RAP
   content in the base layer and asphalt concrete modulus.}},

   the Emergence of Resistance in Structured Populations}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Antiviral resistance in influenza is rampant and has the possibility of
   causing major morbidity and mortality. Previous models have identified
   treatment regimes to minimize total infections and keep resistance low.
   However, the bulk of these studies have ignored stochasticity and
   heterogeneous contact structures. Here we develop a network model of
   influenza transmission with treatment and resistance, and present both
   standard mean-field approximations as well as simulated dynamics. We
   find differences in the final epidemic sizes for identical transmission
   parameters (bistability) leading to different optimal treatment timing
   depending on the number initially infected. We also find, contrary to
   previous results, that treatment targeted by number of contacts per
   individual (node degree) gives rise to more resistance at lower levels
   of treatment than non-targeted treatment. Finally we highlight important
   differences between the two methods of analysis (mean-field versus
   stochastic simulations), and show where traditional mean-field
   approximations fail. Our results have important implications not only
   for the timing and distribution of influenza chemotherapy, but also for
   mathematical epidemiological modeling in general. Antiviral resistance
   in influenza may carry large consequences for pandemic mitigation
   efforts, and models ignoring contact heterogeneity and stochasticity may
   provide misleading policy recommendations.}},

Abstract = {{A patient-level Markov decision model was used to simulate a virtual
   cohort of 500,000 women 40 years old and over, in relation to
   osteoporosis-related hip, clinical vertebral, and wrist bone fractures
   events. Sixteen different screening options of three main scenario
   groups were compared: (1) the status quo (no specific national
   prevention program); (2) a universal primary prevention program; and (3)
   a universal screening and treatment program based on the 10-year
   absolute risk of fracture. The outcomes measured were total directs
   costs from the perspective of the public health care system, number of
   fractures, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Results show that an
   option consisting of a program promoting physical activity and treatment
   if a fracture occurs is the most cost-effective (CE) (cost/fracture
   averted) alternative and also the only cost saving one, especially for
   women 40 to 64 years old. In women who are 65 years and over, bone
   mineral density (BMD)-based screening and treatment based on the 10-year
   absolute fracture risk calculated using a Canadian Association of
   Radiologists and Osteoporosis Canada (CAROC) tool is the best next
   alternative. In terms of cost-utility (CU), results were similar. For
   women less than 65 years old, a program promoting physical activity
   emerged as cost-saving but BMD-based screening with pharmacological
   treatment also emerged as an interesting alternative. In conclusion, a
   program promoting physical activity is the most CE and CU option for
   women 40 to 64 years old. BMD screening and pharmacological treatment
   might be considered a reasonable alternative for women 65 years old and
   over because at a healthcare capacity of \$50,000 Canadian dollars
   (\$CAD) for each additional fracture averted or for one QALY gained its
   probabilities of cost-effectiveness compared to the program promoting
   physical activity are 63\% and 75\%, respectively, which could be
   considered socially acceptable. Consideration of the indirect costs
   could change these findings. (C) 2013 American Society for Bone and

Abstract = {{Addition of pure elements to powder mixes can cause the formation of
   heterogeneous microstructures in powder metallurgy (PM) parts upon
   sintering. For instance, it has been shown that additions of nickel
   particles to an iron powder form nickel rich areas (NRAs), since nickel
   has low diffusivity in iron at conventional sintering temperature {[}
   similar to 1121 degrees C (2050 degrees F)]. Thus, the present work is
   aimed at determining if addition of a small quantity of carbon coated
   nickel nanoparticles to a PM hybrid low alloy steel premix could result
   in a more homogeneous distribution of nickel in sintered parts. It also
   characterises the effect of this addition on microstructures and
   mechanical properties. Grain boundary and volume diffusion coefficients
   of nickel nanoparticles have been determined using Suzuoka's equation
   and wavelength dispersive X-ray spectrometry maps. Results show that
   addition of nanoparticles initiates lattice diffusion at lower
   temperature and produces less NRA.}},

Abstract = {{AbiQ is a phage resistance mechanism found on a native plasmid of
   Lactococcus lactis that abort virulent phage infections. In this study,
   we experimentally demonstrate that AbiQ belongs to the recently
   described type III toxinantitoxin systems. When overexpressed, the AbiQ
   protein (ABIQ) is toxic and causes bacterial death in a bacteriostatic
   manner. Northern and Western blot experiments revealed that the abiQ
   gene is transcribed and translated constitutively, and its expression is
   not activated by a phage product. ABIQ is an endoribonuclease that
   specifically cleaves its cognate antitoxin RNA molecule in vivo. The
   crystal structure of ABIQ was solved and site-directed mutagenesis
   identified key amino acids for its anti-phage and/or its RNase function.
   The AbiQ system is the first lactococcal abortive infection system

Abstract = {{A limited number of comparative studies on falling weight impact
   properties of different composites exist, especially using
   non-destructive techniques (NDTs). In this work, two types of woven
   fabric composites, reinforced respectively with E-glass fibres and
   basalt fibres, were subjected to low velocity impact at different
   energies (7.5, 15 and 22.5 J). Comparative indications were offered by
   impact hysteresis cycles and the integration of data between different
   enhanced vision methods, namely interferometric and IR thermographic
   techniques. The integrated application of these techniques suggests that
   the increased directionality of impact damage observed in basalt fibre
   reinforced composites, though their impact performance appears to be
   slightly superior, may represent a limitation on the predictability of
   their behaviour. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   heterogeneous microstructures in sintered parts. For instance, nickel is
   renowned for forming nickel-rich areas (NRA) in powder metallurgy (PM)
   nickel steels due to its poor diffusivity in iron matrix (or lattice).
   The present work is aimed at characterizing the principal diffusion
   mechanisms of nickel and their influence on microstructures and
   properties of PM nickel steels. A new wavelength dispersive X-ray
   spectrometry (WDS) approach linking line scans and X-ray maps to
   concentration maps is proposed. Grain boundary and volume diffusion
   coefficients of admixed nickel have been determined in PM nickel steels
   using Suzuoka's equation. Results also show that nickel distributes
   itself in the iron matrix mainly by surface and grain boundary
   diffusion.}},

Abstract = {{Fluorescence quenching of fluoranthene by maleic anhydride (MAH) in

   quenching effect was clearly seen from the decrease of the peak
   intensity and integrated area of the residence time distribution (RTD)
   curves when MAH was introduced into PP. Fluorescence quenching effect in
   TSE was compared with that in chloroform solution and in both cases, it
   followed the linear Stern-Volmer equation although it showed lower
   quenching effect in TSE than in solution. Using this quenching
   phenomenon, it was possible to measure online the grafting degree of PP
   with MAH in the TSE. The obtained results showed that MAH grafting
   degree and total conversion measured by both fluorescence technique and
   by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were in good agreement for

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a probabilistic sensor model for the optimization of
   sensor placement. Traditional schemes rely on simple sensor behaviour
   and environmental factors. The consequences of these oversimplifications
   are unrealistic simulation of sensor performance and, thus, suboptimal
   sensor placement. In this paper, we develop a novel probabilistic
   sensing model for sensors with line-of-sight-based coverage (e.g.,
   cameras) to tackle the sensor placement problem for these sensors. The
   probabilistic sensing model consists of membership functions for sensing
   range and sensing angle, which takes into consideration sensing capacity
   probability as well as critical environmental factors such as terrain
   topography. We then implement several optimization schemes for sensor
   placement optimization, including simulated annealing, limited-memory
   Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno method, and covariance matrix
   adaptation evolution strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Recirculation buffer modules combining arrayed waveguide gratings
   (AWGs), tunable wavelength converters (TWCs), and fiber delay lines
   (FDLs) have been proposed to bypass the existing switching bottlenecks
   in massive-scale data centers. Performance studies of such subsystems
   are devoted exclusively to either the network layer or the physical
   layer aspects. Network layer studies consider packet drops only due to
   limited buffering capacity and ignore the critical role of the physical
   layer in degrading signal quality. Purely physical layer studies, on the
   other hand, are oblivious to contention-based drops and load transients.
   As a result, neither approach is able to estimate accurately the
   performance characteristics of buffer modules as key elements in optical
   data centers. In this theoretical work, we integrate the network layer
   and the physical layer effects into a single analysis framework to
   compare various recirculation buffer module designs in terms of
   throughput, delay, signal quality, and complexity. We primarily compare
   the designs in terms of two metrics: maximum operating load and Q-factor
   degradation impact. Our Monte Carlo simulations indicate that Q-factor
   degradation has the dominant role in determining the buffer module
   performance over a wide range of load values, resulting in significant
   bandwidth limitations. In order to implement optical packet switching in
   data centers, tradeoffs between physical layer quality requirements and
   forward error correction (FEC) overheads should be carefully
   investigated.}},

   of the treated fibers. The introduction of coupling agent during fiber
   treating process decreased effectively the moisture uptake. Then, the
   water absorption and mechanical properties were investigated on the
   hemp/PE composites. The loading of coupling agent during fiber treating
   process decreased the water uptake but also decreased the flexural yield
   strength, consequently resulted in lower flexural yield strength after

Abstract = {{In this paper a methodology for extraction of qualitative descriptions
   of data series is extended for proper inflection point recognition. The
   original method allows the extraction of qualitative information such as
   the sign of the first and second derivatives of the assumed signals
   underlying univariate noisy time series. However, it is not able to
   handle consecutive inflection points, i.e. inflection points which
   follow each other in time with no minimum or maximum in between them. To
   improve this method for proper assessment of inflection points, the
   original method is compared with three modifications of the original
   method. One of the alternatives based on repeated application of

Abstract = {{Phenol wet oxidation over deactivating catalysts in three-phase
   moving-bed reactors was simulated by formulating and solving a
   two-scale, nonisothermal, non-steady-state model to highlight the
   strength of on-stream catalyst replacement, in comparison to
   catalyst-batch fixed-bed reactors. Simulation results indicate that
   three-phase moving-bed reactors offer a promising alternative to
   fixed-bed reactors. The autonomy of fixed-bed reactors is limited due to
   severe reduction of catalyst activity, while in moving-bed reactor
   configurations, the decline of pollutant conversion is reduced with
   increased solid velocity, to compensate for the decrease in catalyst
   activity loss. The fixed-bed reactor operates in non-steady-state mode,
   because of the continuous decline of catalyst activity while moving-bed
   reactors evolve to steady-state operation after a transient period.
   Decreasing the reactor feed phenol concentration and increasing liquid
   residence time in the reactor and feed temperature are the best ways to
   oppose rapid deactivation of catalyst in moving-bed reactors.}},

Abstract = {{Segmenting a 3D model is an important challenge since this operation is
   relevant for many applications. Making the segmentation algorithm able
   to find relevant and meaningful geometric primitives automatically is a
   very important step in 3D image processing. In this paper, we adapted a
   2D spectral segmentation method, Power Iteration Clustering (PIC), to
   the case of 3D models. This method is fast and easy to implement. A
   similarity matrix based on normals to vertices is defined and a modified
   version of PIC is implemented in order to segment a 3D model. The
   proposed method is validated on both free-form and CAD (Computer Aided
   Design) models, on real data captured by handheld 3D scanners, and in
   the presence of noise. Results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness
   of the method in all cases.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel resonance-based multicoil structure as a
   smart power surface to wirelessly power up apparatus like mobile, animal
   headstage, implanted devices, etc. The proposed powering system is based
   on a 4-coil resonance-based inductive link, the resonance coil of which
   is formed by an array of several paralleled coils as a smart power
   transmitter. The power transmitter employs simple circuit connections
   and includes only one power driver circuit per multicoil resonance-based
   array, which enables higher power transfer efficiency and power delivery
   to the load. The power transmitted by the driver circuit is proportional
   to the load seen by the individual coil in the array. Thus, the
   transmitted power scales with respect to the load of the
   electric/electronic system to power up, and does not divide equally over
   every parallel coils that form the array. Instead, only the loaded coils
   of the parallel array transmit significant part of total transmitted
   power to the receiver. Such adaptive behavior enables superior power,
   size and cost efficiency then other solutions since it does not need to
   use complex detection circuitry to find the location of the load. The
   performance of the proposed structure is verified by measurement
   results. Natural load detection and covering 4 times bigger area than
   conventional topologies with a power transfer efficiency of 55\% are the
   novelties of presented paper.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a miniature Optogenetics headstage for wirelessly
   stimulating the brain of rodents with an implanted LED while recording
   electrophysiological data from a two-channel custom readout. The
   headstage is powered wirelessly using an inductive link, and is built
   using inexpensive commercial off-the-shelf electronic components,
   including a RF microcontroller and a printed antenna. This device has
   the capability to drive one light-stimulating LED and, at the same time,
   capture and send back neural signals recorded from two microelectrode
   readout channels. Light stimulation uses flexible patterns that allow
   for easy tuning of light intensity and stimulation periods. For driving
   the LED, a low-pass filtered digitally-generated PWM signal is employed
   for providing a flexible pulse generation method that alleviates the
   need for D/A converters. The proposed device can be powered wirelessly
   into an animal chamber using inductive energy transfer, which enables
   compact, light-weight and cost-effective smart animal research systems.
   The device dimensions are 15x25x17 mm; it weighs 7.4 grams and has a
   data transmission range of more than 2 meters. Different types of LEDs
   with different power consumptions can be used for this system. The power
   consumption of the system without the LED is 94.52 mW.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces an automatic coarse-to-fine registration method
   using an implicit volumetric Vector Field representation for 3D point
   clouds. Highly discriminative correspondence detection for coarse
   alignment can be extracted by a process such as cascade-filters. In the
   cascade-filter approach, a number of interest points is first reduced by
   using curvature signs and connected component labeling to segment a view
   into convex and concave disjoint regions. The prominent points are
   selected for each region based on estimated Mean curvature values of
   each local segmentation. A new point similarity descriptor is then
   computed for these selected points to select the best ones for final
   matching. This multidimensional descriptor is a combination of
   information from a Darboux frame defined by the principal directions and
   normal vector at the point, and local Mean curvatures of neigbours. A
   pose refinement process without closest point search is then applied to
   the rough pose estimation. Both registration processes are supported
   entirely and uniquely by the Vector Field representation. The
   reliability of our approach has been validated on multiple real
   datasets.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we present a local comparison approach of deformable 3D
   models. Two types of deformation are discussed. The first is volume
   change which is caused by either an increase or a decrease of the body
   volume. In the second type of deformation, the volume of the model is
   not altered but the change in shape results from either an articulation
   or a bending of parts of the object. Our strategy begins with a global
   alignment of the two shapes such that only their common unchanged parts
   will be aligned perfectly, revealing minimal distances between the
   parts. However, the deformed parts after alignment will be distinct and
   observable. In addition we provide an accurate and simple algorithm to
   measure the difference between the deformed parts of the models after
   the alignment. Experiments were conducted with real scanned 3D data in
   order to verify the performance of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Tourmaline from the Val-d'Or orogenic gold vein field is dravitic,
   plotting in the alkali field with a sodic, low calcium, composition. The
   boron isotope composition of tourmaline ranges from -16.7 to -8.3 parts
   per thousand. Higher delta B-11 in tourmaline is related to higher Ti
   and Mg/(Mg+Fe). Tourmaline fibers display a circa 2 parts per thousand
   increase in delta B-11 over a growth length of less than 1 cm. The range
   in delta B-11 values cannot be explained by boiling in veins or by a
   range of equilibrium temperatures. The variance in tourmaline delta B-11
   values (-16.4 parts per thousand to -10.7 parts per thousand) in one
   large deposit (Sigma) is almost as large as that for the vein field. The
   boron isotope composition in the Val-d'Or vein field tourmaline is
   determined by various mixtures of locally derived boron from metamorphic
   devolatilization of the crustal sequence. This contrasts with tourmaline
   delta O-18 values that are homogeneous at the deposit scale in the
   Val-d'Or orogenic gold vein field (Beaudoin and Pitre 2005).}},

   conversion a solid charge by heat treatment. These systems have been
   investigated extensively to improve the mathematical description of
   dynamic behaviour. Most of the research work on this type of complex
   system is based on models with constant or inaccessible parameters.
   Therefore, this present study, at the basis of a phenomenological model,
   offers an approach to estimate the proposed state variables of a clinker
   rotary kiln. This estimation is done from a steady state condition of
   the kiln when the system inputs were stable. Furthermore, the
   identification procedure developed is devoted to calculate numerically
   all parameters of the model, and find an analytical representation of
   them. Yet due to the complexity of the phenomena taking place therein,
   developed a dynamic model is easy of access.}},

Abstract = {{In most DVC architectures presented in the literature, the puncturing
   mechanism operates according to a periodic pattern that spreads
   uniformly the turbo generated parity bits and discards all the
   systematic bits. These latter are replaced by the receiver side
   information (SI) during the turbo decoding process. The side information
   is generated by a block based motion interpolation algorithm that can,
   furthermore, predict whether or not each block is well interpolated.
   Thus, instead of uniformly dispersing the parity bits over the whole
   turbo code trellis, they can be directed to the most corrupted regions.
   If the side information displays regions that appear to be even more
   highly corrupted, systematic bits can likewise be guided adaptively
   towards these regions. In this paper, an adaptive puncturing scheme is
   proposed. A classification of the corrupted parts of each DCT band of
   the interpolated frame is performed and then an adaptive puncturing
   mechanism is employed for a more efficient parity and systematic bits
   repartition. Simulation results show that the adaptive puncturing scheme
   can provide as much as 20 \% of Wyner-Ziv bitrate reduction: this is
   reflected by a PSNR vs bit rate performance improvement of up to 1.8 dB.}},

Abstract = {{For turbo equalization, the use of Minimum Mean Square Error or
   trellis-based algorithms give remarkable performances over static
   channels, particularly when efficient error correcting codes are used.
   For the selective time varying channels, when the fading rate is
   sufficiently slow, a separate trained Least Mean Square (LMS) or
   Recursive Least Square (RLS) channel estimator may be used to inform the
   equalizer module. However, when the fading rate is high; it is very
   difficult to estimate the channel with great precision which can
   significantly degrade the bit error rate (BER). Channel estimators based
   on the use of the Kalman filter, maximum likelihood and the Wiener
   filter are efficient for fast fading channels. However, they require
   knowledge of channel statistics such as Doppler shift and noise
   variance. In this paper, we focus on turbo equalizers in realistic
   scenarios (i.e. statistics are unknown). We propose and evaluate a low
   complexity iterative receiver; integrating the channel statistics
   estimation. Simulation results show that the proposed receiver can
   achieve performances near those obtained with known statistics. It is
   also proved that if the Doppler frequency is set to a value above or
   below the true value. the BER will significantly degrade.}},

Abstract = {{The ubiquitous real-time monitoring and recording of surface
   electromyography (sEMG) signal is essential to several rehabilitation
   applications, such as muscle recovery analysis. We present an
   inexpensive wireless sEMG sensor using a commercial off-the-shelf
   wireless microcontroller unit (MCU) incorporating a simplified adaptive
   differential pulse code modulation (ADPCM) routine for real-time data
   compression. In single-channel configuration, the presented approach
   reduces power consumption of a transmission subsystem by up to 69\%,
   leading to longer operation life expectancy. Due to the excessive amount
   of data as well as the limited processing power of embedded MCUs,
   multi-channel configurations would normally not be feasible. However,
   the proposed compression method makes a multi-channel EMG sensor
   possible. The distortion induced by this approach on EMG signal is on
   the order of 1\%. Test results from in vivo trials with humans are

Abstract = {{Haloacetic acids (HAAs) are disinfection by-products formed as a result
   of the reaction between chlorine and natural organic matter found in
   water. HAA concentrations have been observed to decrease at distribution
   system extremities. This decrease is associated with microbiological
   degradation by pipe wall biofilm. The objective of this study was to
   evaluate HAA degradation in a drinking water system in the presence of a
   biofilm and to identify the factors that influence this degradation.
   Degradation of dichloracetic acid (DCAA) and trichloroacetic acid (TCAA)
   was observed in a simulated distribution system. The results obtained
   showed that different parameters came into play simultaneously in the
   degradation of HAAs, including retention time, water temperature,
   biomass, composition of organic matter, and pipe diameter. Seasonal
   variations had a major effect on HAA degradation and biomass quantity
   was lower by 1 to 2 logs in the winter and spring compared with the
   fall. HAA removal decreased with increasingly large pipe diameters. The
   specific effects of each of these factors were difficult to isolate from
   each other owing to interactions.}},

   and beam-shapers, have recieved considerable theoretical and
   experimental attention in recent years. The production of these devices
   has been facilitated by the wide availability of silicon-on-insulator

   possibility to design a coherent PhC-based beam-shaper. The basic
   photonic geometry used is a 2D square lattice of air holes in a

   open dielectric cavities. The emphasis is on the generality of the
   system's configuration, i.e. the geometry of the (main) cavity (and
   possible inclusions) and the internal and external dielectric media
   (homogeneous and inhomogeneous). The method is based on a scattering
   formalism to obtain the position and width of the (quasi)-eigenmodes.
   The core of the method lies in the scattering S-matrix and its
   associated delay Q-matrix which contain all the relevant information of
   the corresponding scattering experiment. For instance, the
   electromagnetic near-and far-fields are readily extracted. The
   flexibility of the propagation method is displayed for a selected

Abstract = {{We are interested in the coverage path planning problem with imperfect
   sensors, within the context of robotics for mine countermeasures. In the
   studied problem, an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with
   sonar surveys the bottom of the ocean searching for mines. We use a
   cellular decomposition to represent the ocean floor by a grid of uniform
   square cells. The robot scans a fixed number of cells sideways with a
   varying probability of detection as a function of distance and of seabed
   type. The goal is to plan a path that achieves the minimal required
   coverage in each cell while minimizing the total traveled distance and
   the total number of turns. We propose an off-line hybrid algorithm based
   on dynamic programming and on a traveling salesman problem reduction. We
   present experimental results and show that our algorithm's performance
   is superior to published results in terms of path quality and
   computational time, which makes it possible to implement the algorithm

Abstract = {{Enhancing the performance of slow sand filter pre-treatment with alum
   (i.e. direct or contact filtration) has been proposed as an alternative
   to overcome limitations of conventional gravel (roughing)
   pre-filtration. Experimental results revealed high turbidity reduction
   efficiencies in alum-dosed pre-filtration. However, due to the alum
   coagulation, the nature of the particulates in the pretreatment effluent
   changed and had a potential to shorten the downstream slow sand filter
   run lengths by approximately 50\% under the conditions tested. Hence,
   depending on the effluent turbidity levels the effectiveness of the
   alum-dosed pre-treatment could be compromised, despite its high
   efficiency. Relatively low turbidity levels (<2 NTU) were needed to
   minimise excessive headloss development in alum-dosed filters. However,
   the necessary resources to achieve such process control may not be
   available in developing country contexts. Furthermore, full-scale field
   experiences indicated the limited effectiveness of alum dosing prior to
   slow sand filters and the difficulties in maintaining an adequate
   chemical dosing in under-resourced settings.}},

   Experimental Pavement Response and Predicted Damage}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2369}},
Pages = {{47-56}},
Abstract = {{Past studies suggest that wide-base single tires {[}WBSTs (455/55R22.5)]
   induce pavement strains that can be either more or less severe than
   those caused by dual tires of similar sizing, as strain depends on both
   the spatial direction of the strain and where the strain is located in
   the pavement. An experimental assessment of strain basins occurring at
   various positions within the hot-mix asphalt (DMA) layer, as well as
   within pavement unbound layers, was undertaken to further this
   understanding. The method and the results of this assessment, along with
   the pavement damage predicted by using available models are presented.
   Four failure mechanisms were considered: HMA rutting, both bottom-up and
   top-down fatigue cracking, and structural rutting. Testing was conducted
   at two sites on four roads over a range of loads, pressures, and
   temperatures by using WBSTs and different sizes of dual tires. Data
   analysis showed several critical strain zones near the tire edges and at
   the tire center. Optic-fiber sensors were used to analyze these
   phenomena. HMA rutting was calculated by considering vertical shear
   strain near the surface under the edge of the tires. Other failure
   mechanisms were calculated by using maximum strain. The results
   predicted that the WBSTs tested may induce less damage in the upper part
   of the HMA layer and more damage when fatigue cracking and rutting of
   soils and unbound materials are considered. Data collected were from
   specific tires, and all tests were conducted only under smooth,
   steady-state rolling conditions. Thus, results should neither be
   generalized to all tires nor extrapolated to the prediction of actual
   field performance.}},

   square pulsed thermography (SPT) were used as stimulated heating
   procedures, while two algorithms, named principal component thermography
   (PCT) and pulse phase thermography (PPT), were applied in order to
   enhance the acquired thermographic data. For comparison purposes,
   near-infrared reflectography (NIRR) and transmittography (NIRT), as well
   as laser speckle imaging techniques, were also included. Additionally,
   ultraviolet (UV) imaging technique was used on the samples both as
   complementary approach and as reference for the future inspections. Two
   particular zones highlighted by the latter technique were characterized

Abstract = {{Network reliability analysis problem is the center of many scientific
   productions. It consists of evaluating the oil-terminal reliability of
   networks. Two classes have emerged; exact and approximate methods. The
   aim of this paper is to present an efficient exact method for
   enumerating minimal cuts (MCS) of R-networks. The algorithm proceeds by
   determining minimal paths set (MPS) and from which minimal cuts are
   generated by managing binary decision diagrams. The manipulation process
   consists of a series of transformations, reductions and filtering
   operations. The approach succeeds in the reduction of computation time
   and memory space and was applied for evaluating the reliability of a
   national radio communication network. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Soft soils typically have a low shear strength, high compressibility,
   and low coefficient of permeability. Construction on these deposits
   requires application of soil stabilization techniques such as
   implementing prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) combined with
   pre-loading. In this research, the installation of mandrel-driven
   prefabricated vertical drains and the associated disturbance in soft
   cohesive soils were studied by conducting numerical modeling using a
   commercial finite element software package, ABAQUS. A series of coupled
   analyses, considering the large-strain formulation, were performed in
   the finite element simulation of the mandrel installation. Coulomb's law
   of friction and the penalty method were incorporated into the numerical
   technique. The variations of pore water pressure at different locations
   of the model during the installation of a mandrel-driven PVD and
   withdrawal of the mandrel were illustrated. The pore pressures predicted
   by the author's finite element model agreed with those obtained from the
   large-scale laboratory tests. The pattern of disturbed regions
   surrounding the mandrels and the extent of the smear zone were evaluated
   according to the numerical simulation of the mandrel penetration. The
   variation of the plastic shear strain predicted numerically, and
   normalized by the rigidity index of the soil was used to study the size
   of the smear zone. It is found that the normalized plastic shear strain
   associated with the boundary of the smear zone is almost constant for a
   given type of soil under a specified rate of mandrel driving, regardless
   of the in-situ effective stresses.}},

Abstract = {{Dimensioning and positioning structural beneficial management practices
   (BMPs) represent a ``real life{''} challenge for soil conservation
   engineers, managers, planners and policy-makers. Different factors, such
   as trapping efficiency; implementation, management, and opportunity
   costs (resulting from cropland loss), and government policies and
   guidelines need to be weighed to meet this challenge. The trapping
   efficiency of structural BMPs may depend on many parameters, including:
   (1) characteristics of vegetated filters (VF) such as width and slope,
   vegetation height, vegetation density and species composition, (2) flow
   characteristics such as runoff velocity, discharge volume and water
   height, and (3) sediment characteristics such as particle size,
   aggregation and concentration. Government policies and guidelines may
   include dimension and location of VFs and/or a cropland percentage that
   needs to be converted into VF areas. The main objectives of this paper
   are to: (1) describe the development of the Vegetated Filter
   Dimensioning Model (VFDM), a mathematical model to determine the optimal
   dimensions of riparian vegetated filter strips (RVFSs) in agricultural
   watersheds, and (2) illustrate the potential use of the model on a pilot
   watershed, the Beaurivage watershed, in Quebec, Canada. The latter was
   done for the sole purpose of model testing with readily available input
   parameters and data. The model calculates the optimal width with respect
   to vegetation, topographical, hydrological and sedimentological
   characteristics. The results of this case study showed that the average
   recommended RVFS for the Beaurivage River watershed is about 3 m wide.}},

Abstract = {{Prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) are among the most effective
   methods to control the water table and excess pore water pressure
   developed as a result of seepage or seismic event. Preservation of
   historic sites demands techniques that promptly reduce the excess pore
   pressure within the soil at the site and increase the shear strength.
   Installation of mandrel-driven PVDs and the disturbance created in soft
   cohesive soils were investigated in this research with a new elliptical
   cavity expansion theory (CET). The elliptical CET formulated is based on
   modified Cam clay model for undrained analysis, and accounts for the
   rate of mandrel penetration. Time dependent internal pressure in the
   cavity developed, corresponding stresses and excess pore pressure in the
   soil were evaluated during driving the mandrel. The pattern of
   distribution calculated for the excess pore pressure was verified using
   data obtained from large-scale laboratory tests. A more realistic
   elliptical smear zone around mandrels that are commonly used in the
   field was introduced while the disturbed soil surrounding the mandrel
   was characterized by the plastic shear strain normalized by the rigidity
   index. This analytical formulation was subsequently applied to practical
   situations. Case histories from the Muar clay region in Malaysia, and
   the Sunshine Motorway in Australia were studied to characterize the
   smear zone associated with the installation of PVDs. The ratio of
   plastic shear strain to the rigidity index was found to be useful for
   estimating the extent of the smear zone in the field because the basic
   soil parameters can be readily obtained without sophisticated
   large-scale testing.}},

Abstract = {{The T-matrix method with the Vector Spherical Wave Function (VSWF)
   expansions represents some difficulties for computing optical scattering
   of anisotropic particles. As the divergence of the electric field is
   nonzero in the anisotropic medium and the VSWFs do not satisfy the
   anisotropic wave equations one questioned whether the VSWFs are still a
   suitable basis in the anisotropic medium. We made a systematic and
   careful review on the vector basis functions and the VSWFs. We found
   that a field vector in Euclidean space can be decomposed to triplet
   vectors \{L, M, N\}, which as non-coplanar. Especially, the vector L is
   designed to represent non-zero divergence component of the vector
   solution, so that the VSWF basis is sufficiently general to represent
   the solutions of the anisotropic wave equation. The mathematical proof
   can be that when the anisotropic wave equations is solved in the Fourier
   space, the solution is expanded in the basis of the plan waves with
   angular spectrum amplitude distributions. The plane waves constitute an
   orthogonal and complete set for the anisotropic solutions. Furthermore,
   the plane waves are expanded into the VSWF basis. These two-step
   expansions are equivalent to the one-step direct expansion of the
   anisotropic solution to the VSWF basis. We used direct VSWF expansion,
   along with the point-matching method in the T-matrix, and applied the
   boundary condition to the normal components displacement field in order
   to compute the stress and the related forces and torques and to show the
   mechanism of the optical trap of the anisotropic nano-cylinders.}},

Abstract = {{Agriculture has evolved into the largest non-point source of surface
   water pollution in Canada as a result of intensification over the past
   forty years. The Canadian WEBs project (Watershed Evaluation of
   Beneficial Management Practices, BMPs) was launched to evaluate the
   environmental and economic performance of BMPs as a means to mitigate
   agricultural sediment and nutrient issues. In this paper, the Gestion
   Integree des Bassins versant a l'aide d'un Systeme Informatise (GIBSI)
   (or Integrated Watershed Management using a Computer System) integrated
   modeling framework was used to evaluate the effects of different BMPs on
   sediment and nutrient yields, as well as water quality in the Beaurivage
   River watershed in the province of Quebec. A reference scenario was
   developed that describes the current situation (i.e., base case
   scenario) of the watershed by calibrating the models used within GIBSI,
   namely HYDROTEL for hydrology, the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation
   (RUSLE) for soil erosion, the Erosion-the Productivity Impact Calculator
   (EPIC) of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for contaminant
   transport and fate, and QUAL2E for stream water quality. The effects of
   four BMPs were studied: (1) vegetated riparian buffer strips, (2)
   precision slurry application, (3) grassland conversion of cereal and
   corn fields, and (4) no-till (on corn fields). Simulation results
   indicate that BMPs can be effective in reducing nutrient and suspended
   sediment loads in both surface runoff and stream flow. More
   specifically, buffer strip and crop rotation showed better efficiency
   than hog-slurry management and no-till on corn BMPs. Moreover, results
   highlight the need for further investigation of sediment dynamics in the
   stream network as well as in the riparian buffer strips.}},

Abstract = {{Analytical investigations and large-scale laboratory experiments were
   conducted to study the soil disturbance due to the installation of
   mandrel-driven Prefabricated Vertical Drains (PVDs) in soft saturated

   field, an elliptical Cavity Expansion Theory (CET) was formulated to
   analyze the shear strain and pore pressure developed in soil during the
   mandrel installation. The elliptical CET was developed using modified
   Cam clay parameters for the undrained analysis of PVDs installed in soft
   soil deposits. This formulation identifies a critical zone, a plastic
   zone, and an elastic zone around mandrel-driven prefabricated vertical
   drains. The large-scale laboratory tests consider the effects of in-situ
   stresses using a specially designed consolidometer, and a rate
   controlled installation machine. The pore water pressure was measured at
   various locations during the installation of a PVD and withdrawal of the
   mandrel. The analytically predicted pore pressures agreed with the
   measurements in the laboratory. The results of moisture content tests
   were also analyzed to verify the concept of an elliptical smear zone

Abstract = {{For underwater swimming robots, which use the unconventional method of
   oscillating flippers for propulsion and control, being able to move
   stably at various velocities is challenging. This stable motion
   facilitates navigation, avoids blurring the images taken by a camera
   motion, and enables long-term observations of specific locations.
   Previous experiments with our swimming robot Aqua have shown that its
   autopilot system must adapt the control parameters as a function of
   speed. The reason is that the dynamics of both the robot and the
   thrusting system vary widely as a function of the overall velocity of
   the robot. In this paper, we present the results of manually tuning a
   stable autopilot system for this Aqua swimming robot. We employed a
   well-known technique called gain scheduling to allow for stable
   operation for velocities ranging from 0 to 40 cm/s, in real open sea
   conditions. Thus, our platform is now suitable for vision-based
   navigation in low light conditions as well as for extended observation
   through station-keeping. The results presented here are also a
   proof-of-concept that agile and reactive autonomous hovering is possible
   for flipper-based propulsion system.}},

Abstract = {{More and more, robotics is perceived in education as being an excellent
   way to promote higher quality learning among students, by grounding
   theoretical concepts into reality. In order to maximize the learning
   throughput, the focus of any robotics software platform should be on
   ease of use, with little time spent integrating the components together.
   To this effect, we introduce ros4mat, an open source library which
   provides a simple and flexible interface between ROS (Robot Operating
   System) and Matlab (R). The conception is focused on academic use, and
   allows a very simple integration of sensors and actuators to existing
   Matlab code. The library is designed to provide an easy,
   platform-independent, and fast connection between a robot (running ROS)
   and multiple clients (running only Matlab). Moreover, it is very
   versatile and can be used with many common types of sensors in robotics,
   including low-cost ones. We report the results of ros4mat use in a
   robotics course to provide more real world experimentation, along with
   some code samples illustrating the simplicity of our approach.}},

Abstract = {{Transient conditions such as load rejection will often lead to high
   amplitude pressure fluctuations that will affect a turbine
   residual-life. If Computational Fluid Dynamic offers a promising tool to
   study the flow dynamic under transient regime, focused validation data
   on the runner are still lacking to assess the accuracy of different
   simulation strategies. Hence within the framework of the AxialT project
   of the International Consortium on Hydraulic Machines, exploratory
   measurements of the pressure field on the runner blades of a propeller
   turbine model were performed in transient conditions. The model was
   setup on the test stand of the LAMH of Laval University. The test stand
   control procedures were adapted to mimic transient condition such as
   load rejection or the transition from a normal operating condition to a
   speed-no-load condition. The pressure on the runner blades were measured
   using miniature piezo-resistive transducer linked to a high frequency
   telemetric system. Using specifically adapted data processing routines,
   it was possible to characterize the variations of the energy content
   during the transient runs. Specifically, the main fluctuations appear to
   occur in the sub-synchronous range in both cases.}},

Abstract = {{A good evaluation of the unsteady pressure field on hydraulic turbine
   blades is critical in evaluating the turbine lifespan and its
   maintenance schedule. Low-head turbines such as Kaplan and Propeller,
   using a relatively low number of blades supported only at the hub, may
   also undergo significant deflections at the blade tips which will lead
   to higher amplitude vibration compared to Francis turbines. Furthermore,
   the precise evaluation of the unsteady pressure distribution on low-head
   turbines is still a challenge for computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
   Within the framework of an international research consortium on low-head
   turbines, a research project was instigated at the Hydraulic Machines
   Laboratory in Laval University (LAMH) to perform experimental
   measurements of the unsteady pressure field on propeller turbine model
   runner blades. The main objective of the project was to measure the
   pressure fluctuations on a wide band of frequencies, both in a
   blade-to-blade channel and on the pressure and suction side of the same
   blade, to provide validation data for CFD computations. To do so, a 32
   channels telemetric data transmission system was used to extract the
   signal of 31 pressure transducers and two strain gages from the rotating
   part at an acquisition frequency of 5 KHz. The miniature piezoelectric
   pressure transducers were placed on two adjacent runner blades according
   to an estimated pressure distribution coming from flow simulations. Two
   suction sides and one pressure side were instrumented. The strain gages
   were mounted in full-bridge on both pressure and suction sides to
   measure the blade span wise deflection. In order to provide boundary
   conditions for flow simulations, the test bench conditions during the
   measurements were acquired. The measurements were made in different
   operating conditions ranging from part load, where a cavitating vortex
   occurs, to full load under different heads. The results enabled the
   identification and the quantification of the major known sources of
   pressure fluctuation as well as some unexpected ones. The paper first
   presents the experimental methodology discussing relevant topics such as
   telemetric system setup, transducers calibration and errors analysis.
   The main results are then presented to illustrate the relative amplitude
   of the main source of pressure fluctuations under different operating
   conditions. The discussion and conclusion addresses the important
   observations stemming from the data analysis and illustrates that most
   of the results can be correlated with the known behavior of hydraulic
   turbines while some require further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{A root water-extraction module was incorporated into CATHY, a coupled
   surface-subsurface flow, physically-based, distributed hydrological
   model, to account for transpiration of annual crops. Four empirical
   vertical root-density distribution models were used to evaluate the
   effect of plant transpiration on tile-drain flow and edge-of-field flow.
   Model 1 uses a uniform distribution for the entire root zone; Model 2, a
   nonlinear root density distribution function; and Models 3 and 4, two
   configurations of exponential root water uptake distribution. When
   comparing simulation results with and without a root water extraction
   module, we observed that Model 1 produces reasonable reductions in
   tile-drain and edge-of-field flows. Further analysis indicates that
   edge-of-field flow is more affected by the root water extraction module
   than tile-drain flow. Therefore, as the unsaturated zone increases,
   edge-of-field flow decreases more than tile-drain flow. (C) 2013 The

Title = {{Manganese-impregnated mesoporous silica nanoparticles for signal
   enhancement in MRI cell labelling studies}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},

Abstract = {{Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) are used in drug delivery and
   cell tracking applications. As Mn2+ is already implemented as a
   ``positive{''} cell contrast agent in preclinical imaging procedures (in
   the form of MnCl2 for neurological studies), the introduction of Mn in
   the porous network of MSNs would allow labelling cells and tracking them
   using MRI. These particles are in general internalized in endosomes, an
   acidic environment with high saline concentration. In addition, the
   available MSN porosity could also serve as a carrier to deliver
   medical/therapeutic substances through the labelled cells. In the
   present study, manganese oxide was introduced in the porous network of
   MCM-48 silica nanoparticles (Mn-M48SNs). The particles exhibit a narrow
   size distribution (similar to 140 nm diam.) and high porosity (similar
   to 60\% vol.), which was validated after insertion of Mn. The resulting
   Mn-M48SNs were characterized by TEM, N-2 physisorption, and XRD.
   Evidence was found with H-2-TPR, and XPS characterization, that Mn(II)
   is the main oxidation state of the paramagnetic species after suspension
   in water, most probably in the form of Mn-OOH. The colloidal stability
   as a function of time was confirmed by DLS in water, acetate buffer and
   cell culture medium. In NMR data, no significant evidence of Mn2+
   leaching was found in Mn-M48SNs in acidic water (pH 6), up to 96 hours
   after suspension. High longitudinal relaxivity values of r(1) = 8.4
   mM(-1) s(-1) were measured at 60 MHz and 37 degrees C, with the lowest
   relaxometric ratios (r(2)/r(1) = 2) reported to date for a Mn-MSN
   system. Leukaemia cells (P388) were labelled with Mn-M48SNs and
   nanoparticle cell internalization was confirmed by TEM. Finally, MRI
   contrast enhancement provided by cell labelling with escalated
   incubation concentrations of Mn-M48SNs was quantified at 1 T. This study
   confirmed the possibility of efficiently confining Mn into M48SNs using
   incipient wetness, while maintaining an open porosity and relatively
   high pore volume. Because these Mn-labelled M48SNs express strong
   ``positive{''} contrast media properties at low concentrations, they are
   potentially applicable for cell tracking and drug delivery
   methodologies.}},

Journal = {{WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{321-332}},
Abstract = {{Retention tanks (RTs) are commonly used to reduce combined sewer
   overflows, management of which is an important way of reducing the
   impacts of urban development on receiving waters. However, overflow
   characteristics and the processes affecting them are not yet fully
   understood. In a context of integrated urban wastewater systems, the
   management of RTs is mainly done to satisfy hydraulic constraints even
   if the idea behind such structures is to limit the discharge of
   pollutants to the environment. This study reports new insights in the
   settling processes and the pollutant behaviour occurring in an off-line
   RT. The authors first focus on the total suspended solids (TSS) and the
   total chemical oxygen demand (CODt) dynamics at the inlet and the outlet
   of a RT. Secondly, they focus on the possible relationship between the
   variation of the particle settling velocity distribution of particles
   and the TSS concentration dynamics. Finally, analyses of the TSS and
   CODt concentration evolution during tank emptying give information on
   the interaction between wastewater retention time and the settling
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{The direct synthesis of Fe-3-MIL-88B and Fe2Ni-MIL-88B was analyzed
   using different characterization techniques including UV-vis, IR, and

   Fe-3-MOF-235 seeds which were formed from the first stage of synthesis
   are precursors for the formation of MIL-88B. Fe-3-MOF-235 seeds formed
   in the first stage of synthesis were then transformed to Fe3-MIL-88B in
   the case of single metal, and to mixed Fe2Ni-MIL88B in the case of mixed
   metal synthesis. In the both cases of Fe-3-MIL-88B and Fe2Ni-MIL-88B,
   the FeCl4- anion is a key feature for the formation of MOF-235. An

   metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) MIL-53(Al) and NH2-MIL-53(Al), two
   co-polyimides 6FDA/ODA-DAM (1 : 1 and 1 : 4) and cross-linked
   co-polyimide 6FDA-ODA-DAM (1 : 1, 2\% agent cross-linking APTMDS) were
   used to prepare mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) whilst membranes
   consisting of MIL-53(Al) and commercial polyimides (Matrimid 5218 and
   Ultem 1000) were also fabricated for comparison. Pure gases and blends
   of CO2 and CH4 permeation tests showed enhanced separation performance
   of MMMs with relatively high NH2-MIL-53(Al) loadings (CO2 permeability
   up to 65 Barrer, ideal selectivity up to 36.5). A detailed study of the
   relation between MMM properties and their morphology as affected by the
   nature of continuous polyimide phase was performed. The separation
   factor increased with MOF loading. Furthermore, these materials showed
   stable CO2/CH4 selectivity at increasing feed pressure, in contrast to
   the traditional polymer membranes. The separation performances as
   functions of operation temperature and composition of gas mixture were
   also studied. Experimental permeation data of MMMs with 6FDA-ODA-DAM (1
   : 1, 2\% agent cross-linking APTMDS) and up to 35 wt\% NH2-MIL-53(Al)
   loading are in excellent agreement with the modeling predictions by both
   the Maxwell model and the modified Maxwell model. An approximately ideal
   morphology was reached when preparing MMMs. A computational optimized
   process was proposed in order to estimate simultaneously three
   independent parameters, including gas permeability of dispersed filler,
   interphase thickness and polymer chain rigidification factors, which
   would be applied for non-ideal MMM systems.}},

Abstract = {{We report our recent work on robust object detection in high-resolution
   aerial imagery in urban environment for Intelligence, Surveillance and
   Recognition (ISR) missions. Our approaches used the simple linear
   iterative clustering (SLIC) algorithm, which combines regional and edge
   information to form the superpixels. The irregularity in size and shape
   of the superpixels measured with the Hausdorff distance served to
   determine the salient regions in the very large-scale aerial images.
   Then, the car detection was performed with both the component-based
   approach and the feature-based approach. We merged the superpixels with
   the statistical region merging (SRM) algorithm. The regions were
   described by the radiometric, geometrical moments and shape features,
   and classified using the Support Vector Machine (SVM). The cast shadow
   were detected and removed by a radiometry based tricolor attenuation
   model (TAM). Detection of object parts is less sensitive to occlusion,
   rotation, and changes in scale, view angle and illumination than
   detection of the object as whole. The object parts were combined to the
   object according to their unique spatial relations with the deformable
   object model. On the other hand, we used the invariant scale invariant
   feature transform (SIFT) features to describe superpixels and classed
   them by the SVM as belong or not to the object. All along our recent
   work we can still trace the brilliant ideas by H. J. Caulfield and other
   pioneers in early days of optical pattern recognition for improving the
   discrimination of the matched spatial filter with linear combinations of
   cross-correlations, which have been inherited transformed and reinvented
   to achieve tremendous progress.}},

Abstract = {{Stockpiling ore within a storage facility located between the mine and
   the concentrator can help damp production fluctuations originating from
   either the mining operation or the ore processing operation. To increase
   ore production rates, additional equipment is often installed within
   concentrators and mines. However, ore storage facilities may create
   bottlenecks in the production chain, if they are not properly
   redesigned. This paper proposes a mine-to-mill simulation method to
   determine the limitations of existing ore storage facilities and help
   their resizing in a context of production expansion. The modeling method
   combines three simulators to evaluate the production losses attributed
   to ore storage facilities: (1) a dynamic simulator of the 2D
   distribution of a storage facility filling profile, (2) a dynamic
   logistic model to simulate mine production and (3) a Monte Carlo
   simulator to emulate mine and concentrator equipment downtimes. The
   resulting overall simulator is able to provide answers to a very
   practical and critical industrial question: is an existing ore storage
   facility capable of handling increases in the production rate? Results
   of an application of this simulation technique to an iron ore processing
   plant helped reorient the plant expansion prefeasibility studies. (C)

Abstract = {{During a two-year experiment, 148.4 t wet matter (WM) or 134.0 t dry
   matter (DM) of corn stover (average 9.7\% moisture content, MC) were
   harvested in the spring over an area of 97 ha. The grain had been
   harvested in the previous fall as kernel-cob silage ({''}snaplage{''}).
   The remaining stover available for harvest was estimated at 3.89 and
   4.38 t DM ha(-1) in spring 2010 and 2011, respectively. After stover was
   cut, shredded, and windrowed in a single operation, windrows were
   harvested with a 1.5-m diameter x 1.2-m width round baler or a 66-m(3)
   self-loading wagon (SLW) in 2010 and a 100-m(3) SLW in 2011. The baler
   collected 1.44 t DM ha(-1) at 8.0\% MC; the collection efficiency was
   36\% with respect to stover yields available in the spring. Bales
   weighed 191 kg DM with an average density of 90 kg DM m(-3). The SLW
   collected 1.85 t DM ha(-1) at 6.8\% MC in 2010 and 1.31 t DM ha(-1) at
   10.8\% MC in 2011; collection efficiencies were 57\% and 30\%,
   respectively. Bulk densities were 43.2 and 49.0 kg DM m(3) in the 66 and
   100 m(3) SLW. respectively. The shredder, baler, and SLW were operated
   in the field at average speeds of 12.3, 5.0, and 10.9 km h(-1),
   respectively. The effective field capacities of the shredder and baler
   were 5.1 and 3.8 ha(-1), respectively, while the capacity of the SLW was
   variable due to the travel distance from the field to the storage site.
   The pickup configuration of the SLW allowed good collection efficiency
   and high field speed. Corn stover presented superior absorbency values
   (2.8 on average) for animal bedding when compared to saw dust (2.1) and
   wood shavings (1.8).}},

Abstract = {{Infrared thermography techniques have been used for many years in the
   non-destructive testing and evaluation (NDT \& E) of materials and
   structures. The main advantage of thermography over classical NDT
   techniques resides in the possibility of inspecting large areas in a
   fast and safe manner without needing to have access to both sides of the
   component. Nonetheless infrared thermography is limited to the detection
   of relatively shallow defects (a few millimetres under the surface),
   since it is affected by 3D heat diffusion. However, the most common
   types of anomalies found on composites, such as GRP wind turbine blades
   are delaminations, disbonds, water ingress, node failure and core
   crushing, and can be effectively detected and sometimes quantified using
   active thermographic techniques. This research work presents the use of
   infrared thermography on glass reinforced plastic (GRP) wind turbine
   blades assessment. Finally, the development of an autonomous, novel and
   lightweight multi-axis scanning system, as a concept, deploying in situ
   thermography NDT is also presented, with the intention of developing
   maximisation of the blade area coverage in a single run, at a known
   sensitivity, with the utilisation of the minimum number of system
   degrees of freedom and the maximum repeatability, as well as positional
   accuracy possible.}},

Abstract = {{It is becoming increasingly evident that intelligent systems are very
   beneficial for society and that the further development of such systems
   is necessary to continue to improve society's quality of life. One area
   that has drawn the attention of recent research is the development of
   automatic surveillance systems. In our work we outline a system capable
   of monitoring an uncontrolled area (an outside parking lot) using
   infrared imagery and recognizing suspicious events in this area. The
   first step is to identify moving objects and segment them from the
   scene's background. Our approach is based on a dynamic
   background-subtraction technique which robustly adapts detection to
   illumination changes. It is analyzed only regions where movement is
   occurring, ignoring influence of pixels from regions where there is no
   movement, to segment moving objects. Regions where movement is occurring
   are identified using flow detection via sparse frame analysis. During
   the tracking process the objects are classified into two categories:
   Persons and Vehicles, based on features such as size and velocity. The
   last step is to recognize suspicious events that may occur in the scene.
   Since the objects are correctly segmented and classified it is possible
   to identify those events using features such as velocity and time spent
   motionless in one spot. In this paper we recognize the suspicious event
   suspicion of object(s) theft from inside a parked vehicle at spot X by a
   person{''} and results show that the use of flow detection increases the
   recognition of this suspicious event from 78.57\% to 92.85\%.}},

Abstract = {{Pulsed Thermography (PT) is one of the most widely used approaches for
   the inspection of composites materials, being its main attraction the
   deployment in transient regime. However, due to the physical phenomena
   involved during the inspection, the signals acquired by the infrared
   camera are nearly always affected by external reflections and local
   emissivity variations. Furthermore, non-uniform heating at the surface
   and thermal losses at the edges of the material also represent
   constraints in the detection capability. For this reason, the
   thermographics signals should be processed in order to improve -
   qualitatively and quantitatively - the quality of the thermal images.
   Signal processing constitutes an important step in the chain of thermal
   image analysis, especially when defects characterization is required.
   Several of the signals processing techniques employed nowadays are based
   on the one-dimensional solution of Fourier's law of heat conduction.
   This investigation brings into discussion the three-most used techniques
   based on the 1D Fourier's law: Thermographic Signal Reconstruction
   (TSR), Differential Absolute Contrast (DAC) and Pulsed Phase
   Thermography (PPT), applied on carbon fiber laminated composites. It is
   of special interest to determine the detection capabilities of each
   technique, allowing in this way more reliable results when performing an
   inspection by PT.}},

Abstract = {{Metal oxide nanomaterials have been intensively pursued for modern
   science and nanotechnology. Control over the size and shape of the oxide
   nanoparticles enables tunability of their unique properties sought for
   many useful applications. This review presents a comprehensive overview
   of the recent advances in the shape-controlled synthesis of colloidal
   oxide nanoparticles. We introduce the size- and shape-dependent
   properties of the oxide nanoparticles along with their potential
   applications and subsequent descriptions of the kinetic regime concepts
   of the formation of the monodisperse nanocolloids. Variations of the
   experimental conditions including capping molecules, precursor monomer
   concentration, and reaction temperature/aging have been explored to
   control the shape of the oxide nanoparticles in wet-chemistry syntheses.
   The different capping molecule-assisted synthetic methods of the
   hydro-solvothermal route, the two-phase route, heating-up thermolysis,
   and reverse micelle are presented as a collection of clear examples of
   the regular oxide nanoparticles. We also discuss the advantages and
   obstacles of the synthetic methods that have proven to be controllable
   and reproducible. The author concludes this review with valuable
   portraits on working hypotheses for the shape-controlled oxide
   nanoparticle synthesis.}},

Journal = {{POLYMERS \& POLYMER COMPOSITES}},

Volume = {{21}},

Pages = {{357-366}},
Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the thermal properties of polystyrene/lignin
   composites over a wide range of lignin content. Blending with and
   without a compatibilizer (styrene/ethylene/butylene copolymer) was
   performed in an internal batch mixer to prepare samples between 0 and
   80\%wt of lignin. From the compounds, an extensive thermal study was
   performed, including thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential
   scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis
   (DMTA). TGA results indicated that the thermal stability of polystyrene
   increases with increasing lignin content. DMTA analysis showed higher
   storage modulus and lower loss factor with increasing lignin content for
   the range of temperature studied (30-150 degrees C). DSC results showed
   that the lignin/PS composites have a single T-g which is close to that
   of polystyrene. The addition of a compatibilizer up to 2\%wt was found
   to improve the storage modulus of lignin/PS composite, especially at low
   temperature. Finally, scanning electron microscopy micrographs were used
   to show the state of interfacial adhesion or compatibility between
   lignin particles and the polystyrene matrix.}},

Abstract = {{The electrochemical activity and the corrosion properties of five
   commercial lead anodes were examined by the conventional polarisation
   methods and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy method. The
   results show that the anode Pb-0.62Ag alloy had a lower overpotential

   polarisation of the anode Pb-0.62Ag alloy was higher than that of the
   Pb-0.29Ag-0.1Ca alloy, Pb-0.58Ag alloy and Pb-0.67Ag alloy, but lower
   than that of the anode Pb-0.72Ag alloy. However, the anode Pb-0.72Ag
   alloy had the highest overpotential. When anodes Pb-0.72Ag alloy and
   Pb-0.62Ag alloy were used, the cathode current efficiencies were higher,
   while anodes Pb-0.29Ag-0.1Ca alloy, Pb-0.58Ag alloy and Pb-0.67Ag alloy
   gave lower current efficiency. Regarding these several factors, the
   anode Pb-0.62Ag alloy is the best choice.}},

Abstract = {{Models for predicting the fate of micropollutants (MPs) in wastewater
   treatment plants (WWTPs) have been developed to provide engineers and
   decision-makers with tools that they can use to improve their
   understanding of, and evaluate how to optimize, the removal of MPs and
   determine their impact on the receiving waters. This paper provides an
   overview of such models, and discusses the impact of regulation,
   engineering practice and research on model development. A review of the
   current status of MP models reveals that a single model cannot represent
   the wide range of MPs that are present in wastewaters today, and that it
   is important to start considering classes of MPs based on their chemical
   structure or ecotoxicological effect, rather than the individual
   molecules. This paper identifies potential future research areas that
   comprise (i) considering transformation products in MP removal analysis,
   (ii) addressing advancements in WWTP treatment technologies, (iii)
   making use of common approaches to data acquisition for model
   calibration and (iv) integrating ecotoxicological effects of MPs in

Title = {{Treatment of heavy metals by iron oxide coated and natural gravel media
   in Sustainable urban Drainage Systems}},
Journal = {{WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},

Pages = {{674-680}},
Abstract = {{Sustainable urban Drainage Systems (SuDS) filter drains are simple,
   low-cost systems utilized as a first defence to treat road runoff by
   employing biogeochemical processes to reduce pollutants. However, the
   mechanisms involved in pollution attenuation are poorly understood. This
   work aims to develop a better understanding of these mechanisms to
   facilitate improved SuDS design. Since heavy metals are a large fraction
   of pollution in road runoff, this study aimed to enhance heavy metal
   removal of filter drain gravel with an iron oxide mineral amendment to
   increase surface area for heavy metal scavenging. Experiments showed
   that amendment-coated and uncoated (control) gravel removed similar
   quantities of heavy metals. Moreover, when normalized to surface area,
   iron oxide coated gravels (IOCGs) showed poorer metal removal capacities
   than uncoated gravel. Inspection of the uncoated microgabbro gravel
   indicated that clay particulates on the surface (a natural product of
   weathering of this material) augmented heavy metal removal, generating
   metal sequestration capacities that were competitive compared with
   IOCGs. Furthermore, when the weathered surface was scrubbed and removed,
   metal removal capacities were reduced by 20\%. When compared with other
   lithologies, adsorption of heavy metals by microgabbro was 10-70\%
   higher, indicating that both the lithology of the gravel, and the
   presence of a weathered surface, considerably influence its ability to
   immobilize heavy metals. These results contradict previous assumptions
   which suggest that gravel lithology is not a significant factor in SuDS
   design. Based upon these results, weathered microgabbro is suggested to
   be an ideal lithology for use in SuDS.}},

Abstract = {{Considerable efforts have been put in place towards more responsible
   peatland management and growing media production, trying to reach
   sustainability. Such studies have shown that restoring peatlands may be
   successfully achieved and will bring back habitats and biodiversity in
   areas previously submitted to peat extraction and plant communities.
   Meanwhile, the unique long term C sequestration function of peatland
   ecosystems can be re-established. However, the C footprint of peat
   extraction is still real, as long-term locked up carbon is released
   through exposition with oxygen; but the fate of C after peat usage and
   its interaction with the atmosphere is still a largely unknown field of
   peatland C cycle. Preliminary results indicate that raw Sphagnum fibers
   could be successfully used in growing media, diminishing largely the C
   footprint. Switching from peat to other components using compost and
   other industrial byproducts appears a valuable alternative towards
   sustainability and allows the use of suppressive microorganisms in these
   medium. However, peat alternatives may be limited because of overall
   availability and because of a growing demand for artificial media with
   the coming expansion of urban farming and superfruit (raspberry,
   strawberry, blueberry) production.}},

Abstract = {{This paper generalizes the ``Improved Run-Time Complexity Algorithm for
   Non-Dominated Sorting{''} by Jensen, removing its limitation that no two
   solutions can share identical values for any of the problem's
   objectives. This constraint is especially limiting for discrete
   combinatorial problems, but can also lead the Jensen algorithm to
   produce incorrect results even for problems that appear to have a
   continuous nature, but for which identical objective values are
   nevertheless possible. Moreover, even when values are not meant to be
   identical, the limited precision of floating point numbers can sometimes
   make them equal anyway. Thus a fast and correct algorithm is needed for
   the general case. The paper shows that generalizing the Jensen algorithm
   can be achieved without affecting its O(N log(M-1) N) time complexity,
   and experimental results are provided to demonstrate speedups of up to
   two orders of magnitude for common problem sizes, when compared with the
   correct O(MN2) baseline algorithm from Deb.}},

   showed that the difficulties in simplifying the ensembles mainly
   originate from the preservation of the system reliability. We conclude
   that Pareto fronts generated with NSGA-II allow the development of a
   decision process based explicitly on the trade-off between different
   probabilistic properties. In other words, evolutionary multiobjective
   optimization offers more flexibility to the operational hydrologists

Abstract = {{``Accelerated aging{''} is a simple and conceptually novel methodology
   for the synthesis of functional metal-organic materials, which seeks to
   provide a scalable, mild and environmentally-friendly alternative to
   solution-based or mechanochemical syntheses. Accelerated aging draws
   inspiration from slow processes of geological biomineralization and
   mineral neogenesis, and adapts them for the low-energy and solvent-free
   synthesis of modern metal-organic materials. This systematic study
   outlines the development of an accelerated aging synthesis of
   microporous frameworks from metal oxides CoO and ZnO. Whereas metal
   oxides often require high temperatures or aggressive reagents,
   accelerated aging allows their spontaneous transformation into porous
   materials under surprisingly mild conditions, akin to those of molecular
   self-assembly (humid air, up to 45 degrees C). Here, we describe how
   accelerated aging can be optimized for the one-step synthesis of
   multi-gram amounts of microporous solids. As targets, we selected
   popular zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs): the sodalite-topology
   ZIF-8, its cobalt analogue ZIF-67, and a related zeolite RHO framework.
   Unlike conventional solution or mechanochemical syntheses, accelerated
   aging is diffusion-controlled and does not require continuous agitation,
   bulk solvent or high temperature. The syntheses of ZIF-8 and ZIF-67
   contrast the conventional paradigm of metal-organic framework synthesis,
   by demonstrating that microporous materials can be spontaneously and
   efficiently assembled from a close-packed metal oxide without using
   solvents, high temperature or other activation (e. g. microwave,
   sonochemical, mechanochemical).}},

Abstract = {{In the last decade, wide-angle stereoscopic systems using fisheye lenses
   have been proposed but the compromise made to obtain a large field of
   view is low resolution and high distortion resulting in imprecise depth
   estimation of objects in a 3D scene. High and non-uniform distortion,
   especially in the azimuthal direction, is often considered as a weakness
   of panoramic lenses because it is sometimes difficult to compensate for
   by image processing.
   The aim of this paper is to present an alternative to existing
   stereoscopic panoramic systems by taking advantage of non-uniform
   distortion and anamorphosis in Panomorph lenses. There are many
   challenges related to this project such as the calibration of the system
   and the creation of a 3D depth estimation algorithm that suits the
   resolution of the different areas in the images.
   This paper presents different configurations of two Panomorph lenses
   within a stereoscopic device and a study of specific parameters to
   highlight their impact on the quality of 3D reconstruction of an object
   in a scene. Finally, an overview of future work is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Current urethral reconstruction procedures present many related
   complications. Moreover, the availability of urologic tissue is limited.
   Free of exogenous biomaterials, synthetic polymers or acellular
   matrices, a new tissue engineering technology has been optimized. This
   technique is known as self-assembly. The fibroblasts produce and
   assemble their own extracellular matrix to form a tissue very similar to
   native one. Goals are: to reconstruct a human urethral substitute
   containing a mature urothelium and a functional vascular network. The
   same substitute will also be produced using rabbit cells to allow

Abstract = {{Saint-Augustin Lake is an urban lake in Quebec, Canada that has been
   subjected to long periods of direct human impact, mainly due to
   agricultural and urban activities, with great changes in trophic status
   and chemistry occurring within the last few decades. In 2009, during an
   examination of the lake bottom substrate, the presence of the invasive
   species Cipangopaludina chinensis (Reeve, 1863) was found on floor
   bottom sediments. The gastropods soft tissues were mineralized and
   analyzed by ICP-OES. The purpose of this study was to estimate
   concentrations of heavy metals in C. chinensis, describing the relations
   of these values with the sediment metal. In gastropod soft tissues the
   overall common trend in the heavy metal concentrations was revealed in
   the following order: Fe > Mn > Zn > Cu > As > Ni > Pb > Cd > Cr.
   Biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAFs) have shown that C. chinensis
   cannot be used as a bioindicator of heavy metal pollution and exposure
   in the Canadian lakes where it is present. In fact, while the sediments
   of Saint-Augustin Lake are characterized by high metal concentrations,
   C. chinensis does not have high bioaccumulation factors (BSAFs < 1.0).
   By literature comparison with other aquatic organisms in polluted
   ecosystems at different latitudes it was possible to affirm that the
   concentrations of Fe, Mn and Zn in C. chinensis tissues are considerable
   if compared with these sites.}},

Abstract = {{As the work of the IWA Task Group on Benchmarking of Control Strategies
   for wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is coming to an end, it is
   essential to disseminate the knowledge gained. For this reason, all
   authors of the IWA Scientific and Technical Report on benchmarking have
   come together to provide their insights, highlighting areas where
   knowledge may still be deficient and where new opportunities are
   emerging, and to propose potential avenues for future development and
   application of the general benchmarking framework and its associated
   tools. The paper focuses on the topics of temporal and spatial
   extension, process modifications within the WWTP, the realism of models,
   control strategy extensions and the potential for new evaluation tools
   within the existing benchmark system. We find that there are major
   opportunities for application within all of these areas, either from
   existing work already being done within the context of the benchmarking
   simulation models (BSMs) or applicable work in the wider literature. Of
   key importance is increasing capability, usability and transparency of
   the BSM package while avoiding unnecessary complexity.}},

Abstract = {{The unsteady five-hole Pitot tube, with embedded flush-mounted sensors,
   provides one of the most advanced experimental techniques in fluid

   methodology and use of this type of probe in hydraulic turbines.
   Different fluctuating phenomena can be monitored, providing reliable
   estimates regarding amplitude and frequency. The probe is particularly
   advantageous for applications when the flow exhibits large angular
   fluctuation. In such cases, even the mean values must be validated using
   unsteady measurements. The calibration method and the validation of the
   unsteady measurements are presented through three different hydraulic

Abstract = {{Syntheses of symmetrical etherketone rigid blocks containing from four
   to ten aromatic rings were performed by a succession of Williamson
   synthesis steps, followed by deprotection by BBr3. Solubility decreased
   upon an increase in number of aromatic rings.
   Bis-(p-oxy-(p-hydroxyphenyl))benzophenone, a four-ring block, was
   soluble in the usual solvents (dichloromethane and chloroform), while 6
   and 8-ring blocks were only soluble in dichloromethane to which
   trifluoroacetic acid was added. Rigid-flexible copolyetherketones with
   very short flexible segments were synthesized by reacting the 8-ring
   block with dibromo-terminated short alkane chains of 4 to 10 CH2 units
   in the presence of sodium hydride. Molar masses were estimated by
   MALDI-TOF, which was also used to verify the incorporation of the
   flexible spacers in a regular way. Copolymers are of moderate molecular
   weights (M-w values from 1240 to 2610g mol(1)), and of low
   polydispersity (from 1.02 to 1.17). Rigid blocks and rigid-flexible
   copolymers show high crystallinity and low solubility, in spite of the
   presence of the aliphatic spacers along the chain backbone, showing that
   incorporation of regularly spaced flexible segments does not decrease
   crystallization significantly. These flexible chains however decrease
   thermal stability of the copolymers.}},

Abstract = {{Using long-slit optical spectroscopy obtained at the 10.4 m Gran
   Telescopio Canarias, we have examined the gaseous environment of the
   radio-loud quasar TXS 1436+157 (z = 2.54), previously known to be
   associated with a large Ly alpha nebula and a spatially extended Ly
   alpha-absorbing structure. From the Ly alpha nebula, we measure
   kinematic properties consistent with infall at a rate of similar to
   10-100 M-circle dot yr(-1) - more than sufficient to power a quasar at
   the top of the luminosity function.
   The absorbing structure lies outside of the Ly alpha nebula, at a radius
   of greater than or similar to 40 kpc from the quasar. Against the bright
   unresolved continuum and line emission from the quasar, we detect in
   absorption the NV lambda lambda 1239, 1241, CIV lambda lambda 1548, 1551
   and SiIV lambda lambda 1394, 1403 doublets, with no unambiguous
   detection of absorption lines from any low-ionization species of metal.
   The metal column densities, taken together with the HI column density
   measurement from the literature, indicate that the absorbing gas is
   predominantly ionized by the quasar, has a mass of hydrogen of greater
   than or similar to 1.6 x 10(11) M-circle dot, a gas density of <= 18
   cm(-3), a line-of-sight thickness of >= 18 pc and a covering factor
   approaching unity. While this absorbing structure is clearly not
   composed of pristine gas, it has an extremely low metallicity, with
   ionization models providing a 3 sigma limit of 12+log(O/H) <= 7.3.
   To explain these results, we discuss a scenario involving
   starburst-driven superbubbles and the creation of infalling filaments of
   cold gas which fuel/trigger the quasar. We also discuss the possibility
   of detecting large-scale absorbers such as this in emission when
   illuminated by a powerful quasar.}},

Abstract = {{Carbonation of chrysotile mining residues (CMR) was studied to expose
   the role of residue size and mineralogy, gas composition, liquid
   saturation and watering schemes in saturation-controlled porous beds.
   CO2 uptake dynamics and evolution of carbonating residue were monitored
   in situ in terms of gaseous CO2 absorbed and relative humidity, bed
   liquid saturation, electrical conductivity, pore-water pH, and pressure
   drop. CO2 uptake was contributed both by facile carbonation of
   chrysotile fines and ``domestic{''} brucite, and slow-paced carbonation
   of coarser magnesium silicate particles. Chrysotile carbonation was a
   function of fiber length while inhibited lizardite carbonation was
   indirectly observed. A CO2-lean carbonation regime was identified where
   CO2 uptake increased linearly with the CO2 fraction. This enabled
   extrapolating at very low CO2 gas contents to assess CMR carbonation
   under natural atmospheric conditions. Reduction of saturation and
   backmixing in the liquid proved effective for the proliferation of
   Mg-supersaturated zones to enhance carbonation. Maintaining low liquid
   saturation via periodic liquid additions translated into improved
   carbonation because of inhibition of silanol-polymerization passivation.
   Partial pore saturation proved effective in stimulating carbonation,
   both in flow-through and in diffusive modes, especially at lower CO2
   fractions thus foreseeing implementation of useful optimization
   strategies to enhance ambient carbonation of CMR heaps. (C) 2012

Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL THERMAL AND FLUID SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{825-833}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Laser Doppler Velocimetry was used to study the far field of a turbulent
   round jet at high Reynolds numbers in a well controlled environment
   (Re-D = 1.5 x 10(5), Re-lambda = 548 and x/D = 30). Special care has
   been devoted to statistical convergence in order to obtain very smooth
   distributions of second and third order moments of velocity
   fluctuations. The V and UT distributions respectively satisfy the
   continuity and momentum equations, showing a much better agreement than
   what has been published previously. Despite the fact that the stationary
   hot wire (SHW) technique is known to not properly estimate the high
   order moments, it was shown that in the centerline region of the jet,
   third order moments can be obtained with a better level of accuracy than
   what has been reported. The present LDV database has also been used as a
   comparison reference for a novel conditional analysis of SHW limitations
   based on instantaneous incidence angle. It was shown that when flow
   events with angles outside the SHW sensitivity range are suppressed from
   the LDV measurements, v and w second order moments tend to show better
   agreement with the SHW results. In the case of (uv) over bar this
   analysis led to a nearly perfect match between SHW and altered LDV data.

Title = {{An Improved Secure Image Encryption Algorithm Based on Rubik's Cube
   Principle and Digital Chaotic Cipher}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{A recently proposed secure image encryption scheme has drawn attention
   to the limited security offered by chaos- based image encryption schemes
   (mainly due to their relatively small key space) proposing a highly
   robust approach, based on Rubik's cube principle. This paper aims to
   study a newly designed image cryptosystem that uses the Rubik's cube
   principle in conjunction with a digital chaotic cipher. Thus, the
   original image is shuffled on Rubik's cube principle (due to its proven
   confusion properties), and then XOR operator is applied to rows and
   columns of the scrambled image using a chaos- based cipher (due to its
   proven diffusion properties). Finally, the experimental results and
   security analysis show that the newly proposed image encryption scheme
   not only can achieve good encryption and perfect hiding ability but also
   can resist any cryptanalytic attacks (e. g., exhaustive attack,
   differential attack, statistical attack, etc.).}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, the sintering behaviour of HA particles prepared
   via the wet precipitation method (HAp) and wet mechanochemical technique
   (HAwm) was investigated. The sintering behaviour of a commercial HA
   powder (HAc) was also studied for comparison purpose. All the three
   powders were characterised in terms of particle size, Ca/P ratio and
   crystal size. Green samples were prepared and sintered in air at
   temperatures ranging from 1000 degrees C to 1400 degrees C. The sintered
   bodies were studied in terms of the phase stability, relative density,
   Young's modulus, Vickers hardness, fracture toughness and grain size.
   The results indicated that HAwm samples suffered phase decomposition
   while the HAp and HAc sintered samples showed no phase disruption
   throughout the temperature range employed. The HAp samples exhibited the
   overall best densification and properties when compared to the HAc and
   HAwm samples. Furthermore, the results showed that mechanical properties
   of sintered samples were governed by both the bulk density and the grain
   size. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is natural gas transformed into liquid state
   for the purpose of transportation mainly by specially built LNG vessels.
   This paper considers a real-life LNG ship routing and scheduling problem
   where a producer is responsible for transportation from production site
   to customers all over the world. The aim is to create routes and
   schedules for the vessel fleet that are more robust with respect to
   uncertainty such as in sailing times due to changing weather conditions.
   A solution method and several robustness strategies are proposed and
   tested on instances with time horizons of 3-12 months. The resulting
   solutions are evaluated using a simulation model with a recourse
   optimization procedure. The results show that there is a significant
   improvement potential by adding the proposed robustness approaches. (C)

Abstract = {{Wastes from animal production and from the paper industry are often used
   as amendments to agricultural soils. Although data exist on the impacts
   of raw animal wastes on N2O production, little is known regarding the
   effects of paper wastes and biosolids from treated animal waste. We
   measured N2O emissions for two consecutive snow-free seasons (mid-May
   through the end of October) from poorly drained clayey soils under corn
   (Zea mays L.). Soils were amended with raw pig slurry (PS) or biosolids
   (four PS-derived and two paper sludges) and compared with soils with
   mineral N fertilizer (CaNH4NO3) or without N addition (Control).
   Area-based N2O emissions from the mineral N fertilizer (average, 8.2 kg
   N2O-N ha(-1); 4.2\% of applied N) were higher (P < 0.001) than emissions
   from the organic amendments, which ranged from 1.5 to 6.1 kg N2O-N
   ha(-1) (-0.4 to 2.5\% of applied N). The N2O emissions were positively
   correlated with mean soil NO3 availability (calculated as ``NO3
   exposure{''}), which was highest with mineral N fertilizer. In plots
   treated with organic amendments (i.e., biosolids and raw PS), NO3
   exposure was negatively correlated to the C:N ratio of the amendment.
   This resulted in lower N2O emissions from the higher C: N ratio
   biosolids, especially compared with the low C:N ratio PS. Application of
   paper sludge or PS-derived biosolids to these fine-textured soils,
   therefore, reduced N2O emissions compared with raw PS and/or mineral N
   fertilizers (P < 0.01).}},

Abstract = {{The mechanism of heterogeneous grain refining of aluminum by ultrafine
   elemental boron particles was investigated. In order to facilitate the
   observation of the boron-aluminum interface, a boron filament was
   introduced in a melt at 1013 K (740 degrees C) containing different
   levels of Ti. The Al/B interface was studied using transmission electron
   microscopy and different phases were identified using the electron
   diffraction method. The experimental results showed that boron is
   dissolved in pure aluminum while its dissolution is inhibited in
   presence of titanium solute. A thin layer of TiB2 formed at the surface
   of boron thickens with residence time in the melt. The mechanisms by
   which aluminum is crystallized on boron are discussed. DOI:

   to predict the contaminant removal in centralised treatment works,
   considering the dramatic improvement in monitoring and detecting MPs in
   wastewater, more mechanistic approaches should be used to complement
   conventional, heuristic and other fate models. This is crucial, as
   regional risk assessments and model-based evaluations of pollution
   discharge from urban areas can potentially be used by decision makers to
   evaluate effluent quality regulation, and assess upgrading requirements,

   (100-600 km(2)) situated in the Cevennes-Vivarais region (Southern
   France) and characterized by short lag times (3-12 h). In this
   framework, flood forecasts need hourly Probabilistic Quantitative
   Precipitation Forecasts (PQPF) so as to provide early warning with 24-72
   h of anticipation. Here, two sources of PQPF at daily and subdaily (6 h)
   meteorological time steps are considered: Ensemble Prediction Systems
   from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) and
   analogy-based PQPF provided in real-time at the Laboratoire d'etude des
   Transferts en Hydrologie et Environnement. The two PQPF are firstly
   disaggregated to respect the required hydrological hourly time step,
   through either the use of a stochastic rainfall generator or the
   application of a multimodel approach. Then, disaggregated PQPF are used
   as input to a hydrological model, which is called TOPSIMPL, to provide
   hourly ensemble discharge forecasts up to 48 h ahead. Illustration and
   evaluation of ensemble discharge forecasts issued in near real-time
   conditions are given for some recently observed flash flood events. It
   is shown that hourly discharge forecasts are first-order conditioned by
   the accuracy of PQPF at daily or subdaily time step. Six-hour ensemble
   prediction systems correctly reproduce the rainfall temporal dynamics,
   whereas daily analogy-based PQPF are less underdispersive in terms of
   rainfall amounts. As a result, the merging of the two sources of PQPF
   substantially increases the performance of discharge forecasts, the
   contribution of a more sophisticated hourly rainfall generator becoming
   marginal. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Ensemble rainfall forecasts are of high interest for decision making, as
   they provide an explicit and dynamic assessment of the uncertainty in
   the forecast. However, for hydrological forecasting, their low
   resolution currently limits their use to large watersheds. To bridge
   this gap, various implementations of a spatial statistical downscaling
   method were compared, bringing Environment Canada's global ensemble
   rainfall forecasts from a 100 Chi 70-km resolution down to 6 Chi 4-km
   while increasing each pixel's rainfall variance and preserving its
   original mean. This was applied for nine consecutive days of summer 2009
   with strong rain events over Quebec City, Canada. For comparison
   purposes, simpler methods were also implemented such as the bilinear
   interpolation, which disaggregates global forecasts without modifying
   their variance.
   The meteorological products were evaluated, using different scores and
   diagrams, against observed values taken from Quebec City rain gauge
   network. The most important conclusions of this work are that the
   overall quality of the forecasts was preserved during the disaggregation
   procedure and that the disaggregated products using the
   variance-enhancing method were of similar quality than bilinear
   interpolation products. However, variance and dispersion of the
   different members were, of course, much improved for the
   variance-enhanced products, compared with the bilinear interpolation,
   which is a decisive advantage. Therefore, there is an interest in
   implementing variance-enhancing methods to disaggregate global ensemble
   rainfall forecasts. Copyright (C) 2012 Her Majesty the Queen in right of

Abstract = {{The presence of off-flavour compounds such as geosmin, often found in
   raw water, significantly reduces the organoleptic quality of distributed
   water and diverts the consumer from its use. To adapt water treatment
   processes to eliminate these compounds, it is necessary to be able to
   identify them quickly. Routine analysis could be considered a solution,
   but it is expensive and delays associated with obtaining the results of
   analysis are often important, thereby constituting a serious
   disadvantage. The development of decision-making tools such as
   predictive models seems to be an economic and feasible solution to
   counterbalance the limitations of analytical methods. Among these tools,
   multi-linear regression and principal component regression are easy to
   implement. However, due to certain disadvantages inherent in these
   methods (multicollinearity or non-linearity of the processes), the use
   of emergent models involving artificial neurons networks such as
   multi-layer perceptron could prove to be an interesting alternative. In
   a previous paper (Parinet et al., Water Res 44: 5847-5856, 2010), the
   possible parameters that affect the variability of taste and odour
   compounds were investigated using principal component analysis. In the
   present study, we expand the research by comparing the performance of
   three tools using different modelling scenarios (multi-linear
   regression, principal component regression and multi-layer perceptron)
   to model geosmin in drinking water sources using 38 microbiological and
   physicochemical parameters. Three very different sources of water, in
   terms of quality, were selected for the study. These sources supply
   drinking water to the Qu,bec City area (Canada) and its vicinity, and
   were monitored three times per month over a 1-year period. Seven
   different modelling methods were tested for predicting geosmin in these
   sources. The comparison of the seven different models showed that simple
   models based on multi-linear regression provide sufficient predictive
   capacity with performance levels comparable to those obtained with
   artificial neural networks. The multi-linear regression model (R (2) =
   0.657, < 0.001) used only four variables (phaeophytin, sum of green
   algae, chlorophyll-a and potential Redox) in comparison with ten
   variables (potassium, heterotrophic bacteria, organic nitrogen, total
   nitrogen, phaeophytin, total organic carbon, sum of green algae,
   potential Redox, UV absorbance at 254 nm and atypical bacteria) for the
   best model obtained with artificial neural networks (R (2) = 0.843).}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) results of broadband
   measurements and modeling of signal propagation characteristics in the
   60 GHz band. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the importance of
   the presence of deflecting obstacles (DOs) for indoor wireless local
   area network (WLAN) applications in the unlicensed 60 GHz band. Based on
   sweeping-frequency sounding technique (59.6-60.6 GHz), an indoor
   propagation measurement campaign was carried out in a typical T-shaped
   intersection of two long corridors under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) at a
   distance of 20 meters between transmit and receive antennas, with and
   without the presence of DOs. Based on Ray-Tracing (RT) technique,
   deterministic models are derived for the considered environment. An
   interesting agreement is achieved between the predicted and the
   experimental results in both frequency and time domains. Thus, this work
   demonstrates that mm-waves communications are very sensitive to the
   propagation environment as compared with lower frequency bands. In NLOS
   corridor environments, the signal transmission relies mainly on the
   unavoidable diffraction phenomenon from the intersection corners.
   However, the presence of a DO might overcome significantly the hostile
   propagation characteristics that are normally encountered under NLOS
   propagation conditions.}},

Title = {{A comparative study of small field total scatter factors and dose

   dosimeters: The case of the CyberKnife}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Small-field dosimetry is challenging, and the main limitations
   of most dosimeters are insufficient spatial resolution, water
   nonequivalence, and energy dependence. The purpose of this study was to
   compare plastic scintillation detectors (PSDs) to several commercial
   stereotactic dosimeters by measuring total scatter factors and dose
   profiles on a CyberKnife system.
   Methods: Two PSDs were developed, having sensitive volumes of 0.196 and
   0.785 mm(3), and compared with other detectors. The spectral
   discrimination method was applied to subtract. Cerenkov light from the
   signal. Both PSDs were compared to four commercial stereotactic
   dosimeters by measuring total scatter factors, namely, an IBA dosimetry
   stereotactic field diode (SFD), a PTW 60008 silicon diode, a PTW 60012
   silicon diode, and a microLion. The measured total scatter factors were
   further compared with those of two independent Monte Carlo studies. For
   the dose profiles, two commercial detectors were used for the
   comparison, i.e., a PTW 60012 silicon diode and Gafchromics EBT2. Total
   scatter factors for a CyberKnife system were measured in circular fields
   with diameters from 5 to 60 mm. Dose profiles were measured for the 5-
   and 60-mm cones. The measurements were performed in a water tank at a
   1.5-cm depth and an 80-cm source-axis distance.
   Results: The total scatter factors measured using all the detectors
   agreed within 1\% with the Monte Carlo values for cones of 20 mm or
   greater in diameter. For cones of 10-20 mm in diameter, the PTW 60008
   silicon diode was the only dosimeter whose measurements did not agree
   within 1\% with the Monte Carlo values. For smaller fields (<10 mm),
   each dosimeter type showed different behaviors. The silicon diodes
   over-responded because of their water nonequivalence; the microLion and
   1.0-mm PSD under-responded because of a volume-averaging effect; and the
   0.5-mm PSD was the only detector within the uncertainties of the Monte
   Carlo simulations for all the cones. The PSDs, the PTW 60012 silicon
   diode, and the Gafchromics EBT2 agreed within 2\% and 0.2 mm (gamma
   evaluation) for the measured dose profiles except in the tail of the
   60-mm cone.
   Conclusions: Silicon diodes can be used to accurately measure
   small-field dose profiles but not to measure total scatter factors,
   whereas PSDs can be used to accurately measure both. The authors'
   measurements show that the use of a 1.0-mm PSD resulted in a negligible
   volume-averaging effect (under-response of approximate to 1\%) down to a
   field size of 5 mm. Therefore, PSDs are strong candidates to become
   reference radiosurgery detectors for beam characterization and quality
   assurance measurements. (C) 2013 American Association of Physicists in

Abstract = {{This article presents an analytical model allowing the determination of
   the, d33, piezoelectric coefficient in cellular polymer films. The
   cellular film is identified to an equivalent effective layered structure
   made of alternating gas and solid layers that are electrically charged
   at their interfaces. The model expresses the d33 piezoelectric
   coefficient as a function of porosity, film thickness, free-stress
   surface charge density, and the film modulus, which depends on
   frequency. The temperature is indirectly taken into account as it is
   involved in the parameters appearing in the final equation of the model.
   The obtained results showed that the piezoelectric activity of charged
   cellular polymer films decreases with the film thickness and increases
   with the film expansion and the surface charge density. The variation
   with the percentage of porosity shows a nonlinear trend, with an
   increase in the d33 piezoelectric coefficient with the void fraction,
   and then a decrease when such a percentage exceeds a thickness-dependent
   critical value. Such quantitative description of the piezoelectric
   activity can help the design of cellular films with enhanced
   piezoelectric performances. The model predictions were also compared

Abstract = {{A new rational approach has been developed for the synthesis of a mixed
   metal MIL-88B metal-organic framework based on a neutral mixed metal
   cluster, such as Fe2Ni(mu(3)-O). Unlike the conventional negative
   charged single metal cluster, the use of the neutral mixed metal cluster
   as nodes in the framework avoids the need of a compensating anion inside
   the porous MIL-88B system; thus the mixed metal MIL-88B becomes porous.
   The flexibility of the mixed metal MIL-88B can be controlled by terminal
   ligands with different steric hindrance. This allows us to reversibly
   customize the porosity of the MIL-88B structure at three levels of
   specific surface area as well as the pore volume.}},

Abstract = {{Highly ordered SBA-16 silica mesoporous materials were synthesised
   hydro-solvothermally under the acidic medium using
   SiO2/F127/BuOH/HCl/H2O gel. Pure SiO2 powders were prepared from
   inexpensive and environmentally friendly silica source of rice husk. The
   pore size of the materials could be optimised by using a blend of P123
   and F127 templates. Sn-substituted SBA-16 mesoporous materials were
   yielded via the direct injection of stannic chloride into the fixed gel
   in acidic medium. X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption, scanning electron
   microscope/transmission electron microscope results suggest that tin
   ions were incorporated into the Si-SBA-16 framework by isomorphous
   substitution between Sn and Si ions. Elemental analysis indicates that
   tin can be substituted in the range of Si/Sn?=?21.410.5. UVvis, XPS,
   TPR-H2, TPD-NH3 results reveal that tin atoms are highly dispersed in 4+
   oxidation state and mostly occupy in the silica framework. The degree of
   tin incorporation into silica framework can easily be controlled by a
   simply adjustment of the H2O and HCl molar ratios. The mesoporous
   Sn-SBA-16 materials were an active benzylation catalyst with almost
   100\% selectivity to monoalkylated product in alkylation of aromatics
   with benzyl chloride. (c) 2011 Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering}},

Abstract = {{Trickle-bed reactors (TBRs), which accommodate the flow of gas and
   liquid phases through packed beds of catalysts, host a variety of
   gasliquidsolid catalytic reactions, particularly in the
   petroleum/petrochemical industry. The multiphase flow hydrodynamics in
   TBRs are complex and directly affect the overall reactor performance in
   terms of reactant conversion and product yield and selectivity.
   Non-ideal flow behaviours, such as flow maldistribution, channelling or
   partial catalyst wetting may significantly reduce the effectiveness of
   the reactor. However, conventional TBR modelling approaches cannot
   properly account for these non-ideal behaviours owing to the complex
   coupling between fluid dynamics and chemical kinetics. Recent advances
   in the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to three-phase
   TBR systems have shown promise of achieving a deeper understanding of
   the interactions between multiphase fluid dynamics and chemical
   reactions. This study is intended to give a state-of-the-art overview of
   the progress achieved in the field of CFD simulation of TBRs over the
   past two decades. The fundamental modelling framework of multiphase flow
   in TBRs, advances in important constitutive models, and the application
   of CFD models are discussed in detail. Directions for future research
   are suggested.}},

Abstract = {{Torrefaction of woody biomass as a thermal pretreatment to increase
   biomass energy density is prerequisite to many thermochemical
   conversions. An ionic-liquid (IL) biomass torrefaction route was
   proposed and investigated as an alternative to conventional dry and wet
   torrefaction for enhancing the rate of biomass torrefaction and for
   potentially improving the quality of torrefied solid products. Ionic
   liquid-impregnated aspen, birch and sawdust were torrefied in the
   240-280 degrees C temperature range using {[}Emi-wm]{[}OTf],
   {[}Emim]{[}BF4] and {[}Hmim]{[}NTf2] ILs. To assess the benefits of IL
   impregnated biomass, dry and IL torrefaction were compared in terms of
   mass yield, energy density, energy yield, hydrophobicity and ultimate
   moisture uptake of torrefied solid products using thermogravimetry and
   fixed-bed setups. At equal reaction time and treatment temperature, the
   decomposition rates of birch, aspen and sawdust in ILs were considerably
   enhanced compared to their dry torrefaction counterparts. IL
   torrefaction led to increased energy density of treated aspen, birch and
   sawdust solids alike, whereas improved hydrophobicity of IL-torrefied
   solids translated in nearly 40-45\% reduction of their ultimate moisture
   uptake. Finally, char and ash leftovers building up in spent ILs after
   repeated IL torrefaction cycles were specifically addressed as potential
   factors responsible for IL decomposition. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

   answer the following question: how to combine LWIR and color information
   in order to optimize foreground / background segmentation accuracy.
   Starting from an improved state-of-the-art color-based approach, we
   integrated thermal information into the algorithm with a pixel-level
   analytical fusion technique. Considering that very few public thermal /
   color video databases are available, we built our own acquisition
   platforms to grab numerous co-registered LWIR / color videos in a
   variety of outdoor conditions. We manually generated the pixel-based
   ground-truth for a representative selection of these sequences and
   performed a quantitative performance analysis. We demonstrated, among
   others, that the combination of thermal and color information proposed
   outperformed the use of a single spectral band in all tested visibility
   conditions.}},

   operating conditions, downlink residual modulation on the reflected
   optical carrier can be minimized to allow the transmission of a WiFi
   Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Uplink (OFDM-UL) signal. We
   experimentally demonstrate bidirectional transmission over 20km of
   standard single mode fiber (SSMF) and show an operational region where
   we can achieve error-free for a 1Gb/s OOK-DL signal while we remain

Title = {{An endothelialized urothelial cell-seeded tubular graft for urethral

Abstract = {{Introduction: Many efforts are used to improve surgical techniques and
   graft materials for urethral reconstruction. We developed an
   endothelialized tubular structure for urethral reconstruction.
   Methods: Two tubular models were created in vitro. Human fibroblasts
   were cultured for 4 weeks to form fibroblast sheets. Then, endothelial
   cells (ECs) were seeded on the fibroblast sheets and wrapped around a
   tubular support to form a cylinder for the endothelialized tubular
   urethral model (ET). No ECs were added in the standard tubular model
   (T). After 21 days of maturation, urothelial cells were seeded into the
   lumen of both models. Constructs were placed under perfusion in a
   bioreactor for 1 week. At several times, histology and
   immunohistochemistry were performed on grafted nude mice to evaluate the
   impact of ECs on vascularization.
   Results: Both models produced an extracellular matrix, without exogenous
   material, and developed a pseudostratified urothelium. Seven days after
   the graft, mouse red blood cells were present only in the outer layers
   in T model, but in the full thickness of ET model. After 14 days,
   erythrocytes were present in both models, but in a greater proportion in
   ET model. At day 28, both models were well-vascularized, with
   capillary-like structures in the whole thickness of the tubes.
   Conclusion: Incorporating endothelial cells was associated with an
   earlier vascularization of the grafts, which could decrease the necrosis
   of the transplanted tissue. As those models can be elaborated with the
   patient's cells, this tubular urethral graft would be unique in its
   autologous property.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, age replacement policies for two-component parallel
   system with stochastic dependence are investigated. The stochastic
   dependence considered, is modeled by a one-sided domino effect. The
   failure of component 1 at instant t may induce the failure of component
   2 at instant t+t with a given probability. The time delay t is a random
   variable with known probability density function. The system is
   considered in a failed state when both components are failed. The
   proposed replacement policies suggest to replace the system upon failure
   or at age T whichever occurs first. In the first policy, costs and
   durations associated with maintenance activities are supposed to be
   constant. In the second replacement policy, the preventive replacement
   cost depends on the system's state and age. The expected cost per unit
   of time over an infinite span is derived and numerical examples are
   presented. The mathematical model can be used to analyze the stochastic
   dependence on the performance of the system}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with a system maintenance optimization problem. The
   system to be maintained is assumed to be continuously monitored and
   subject to stochastic degradation. The proposed maintenance model
   considers three types of maintenance actions: minimal repair, preventive
   maintenance( PM) and replacement. PM are performed at dates kT (k = 1;
   2, ...) while minimal repair are executed at failure occurrence during a
   PM cycle. The system is completely renewed whenever its corresponding
   accumulated operating time reaches a given value. The objective of the
   proposed maintenance optimization model consists on finding the joint
   optimal PM period together with the number of PM actions to be performed
   before replacing the system so as to maximize its average availability.
   A mathematical optimization model is proposed and the solution of which
   is addressed in a particular case where the system lifetimes are Weibull
   distributed. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the proposed
   maintenance optimization approach.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most important challenges in systems biology is to understand
   how cells respond to genetic and environmental perturbations. Here we
   show that the yeast DHFR-PCA, coupled with high-resolution growth
   profiling (DHFR-qPCA), is a straightforward assay to study the
   modulation of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in vivo as a response
   to genetic, metabolic and drug perturbations. Using the canonical
   Protein Kinase A (PKA) pathway as a test system, we show that changes in
   PKA activity can be measured in living cells as a modulation of the
   interaction between its regulatory (Bcy1) and catalytic (Tpk1 and Tpk2)
   subunits in response to changes in carbon metabolism, caffeine and
   methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) treatments and to modifications in the
   dosage of its enzymatic regulators, the phosphodiesterases. Our results
   show that the DHFR-qPCA is easily implementable and amenable to
   high-throughput. The DHFR-qPCA will pave the way to the study of the
   effects of drug, genetic and environmental perturbations on in vivo PPI
   networks, thus allowing the exploration of new spaces of the eukaryotic
   interactome.}},

Abstract = {{This work critically reviews modeling concepts for standard activated
   sludge wastewater treatment processes (e.g., hydrolysis, growth and
   decay of organisms, etc.) for some of the most commonly used models.
   Based on a short overview on the theoretical biochemistry knowledge this
   review should help model users to better understand (i) the model
   concepts used; (ii) the differences between models, and (iii) the limits
   of the models. The seven analyzed models are: (1) ASM1; (2) ASM2d; (3)
   ASM3; (4) ASM3?+?BioP; (5) ASM2d?+?TUD; (6) Barker \& Dold model; and
   (7) UCTPHO+. Nine standard processes are distinguished and discussed in
   the present work: hydrolysis; fermentation; ordinary heterotrophic
   organisms (OHO) growth; autotrophic nitrifying organisms (ANO) growth;
   OHO \& ANO decay; poly-hydroxyalkanoates (PHA) storage; polyphosphate
   (polyP) storage; phosphorus accumulating organisms PAO) growth; and PAO
   decay. For a structured comparison, a new schematic representation of
   these processes is proposed. Each process is represented as a reaction
   with consumed components on the left of the figure and produced
   components on the right. Standardized icons, based on shapes and color
   codes, enable the representation of the stoichiometric modeling concepts
   and kinetics. This representation allows highlighting the conceptual
   differences of the models, and the level of simplification between the
   concepts and the theoretical knowledge. The model selection depending on
   their theoretical limitations and the main research needs to increase
   the model quality are finally discussed. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2013; 110:

Abstract = {{There is increasing evidence showing that ammonia-oxidizing bacteria
   (AOB) are major contributors to N2O emissions from wastewater treatment
   plants (WWTPs). Although the fundamental metabolic pathways for N2O
   production by AOB are now coming to light, the mechanisms responsible
   for N2O production by AOB in WWTP are not fully understood. Mathematical
   modeling provides a means for testing hypotheses related to mechanisms
   and triggers for N2O emissions in WWTP, and can then also become a tool
   to support the development of mitigation strategies. This study examined
   the ability of four mathematical model structures to describe two
   distinct mechanisms of N2O production by AOB. The production mechanisms
   evaluated are (1) N2O as the final product of nitrifier denitrification
   with NO?2- as the terminal electron acceptor and (2) N2O as a byproduct
   of incomplete oxidation of hydroxylamine (NH2OH) to NO?2-. The four
   models were compared based on their ability to predict N2O dynamics
   observed in three mixed culture studies. Short-term batch experimental
   data were employed to examine model assumptions related to the effects
   of (1) NH?4+ concentration variations, (2) dissolved oxygen (DO)
   variations, (3) NO?2- accumulations and (4) NH2OH as an externally
   provided substrate. The modeling results demonstrate that all these
   models can generally describe the NH?4+, NO?2-, and NO?3- data. However,
   none of these models were able to reproduce all measured N2O data. The
   results suggest that both the denitrification and NH2OH pathways may be
   involved in N2O production and could be kinetically linked by a
   competition for intracellular reducing equivalents. A unified model
   capturing both mechanisms and their potential interactions needs to be
   developed with consideration of physiological complexity. Biotechnol.

Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Enzyme engineering has been facilitated by recombination of close
   homologues, followed by functional screening. In one such effort,
   chimeras of two class-A beta-lactamases - TEM-1 and PSE-4 - were created
   according to structure-guided protein recombination and selected for
   their capacity to promote bacterial proliferation in the presence of
   ampicillin (Voigt et al., Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002 9: 553). To provide a
   more detailed assessment of the effects of protein recombination on the
   structure and function of the resulting chimeric enzymes, we
   characterized a series of functional TEM-1/PSE-4 chimeras possessing
   between 17 and 92 substitutions relative to TEM-1 beta-lactamase.
   Circular dichroism and thermal scanning fluorimetry revealed that the
   chimeras were generally well folded. Despite harbouring important
   sequence variation relative to either of the two `parental'
   beta-lactamases, the chimeric beta-lactamases displayed substrate
   recognition spectra and reactivity similar to their most closely-related
   parent. To gain further insight into the changes induced by
   chimerization, the chimera with 17 substitutions was investigated by NMR
   spin relaxation. While high order was conserved on the ps-ns timescale,
   a hallmark of class A beta-lactamases, evidence of additional slow
   motions on the ms-ms timescale was extracted from model-free
   calculations. This is consistent with the greater number of resonances
   that could not be assigned in this chimera relative to the parental
   beta-lactamases, and is consistent with this well-folded and functional
   chimeric beta-lactamase displaying increased slow time-scale motions.}},

Abstract = {{An inverted microscopy technique was implemented to scrutinize the
   wall-region hydrodynamics of gas-liquid cocurrent flows in micropacked
   beds. Digital image analysis enabled characterization of two contiguous
   flow regimes, hysteresis, and transition thereof. Low- and
   high-interaction regimes featuring, respectively, slow and rapid
   displacements of gas-liquid boundary were identified. The onset of
   regime changeover was delineated by distinguishing the fluctuating
   behavior in time of characteristic lengths extracted from the areas
   occupied by gas and liquid in the field of view. A Charpentier and
   Favier flow regime map demarcating low and high interaction regimes in
   conventional macroscale trickle beds was elaborated for the sake of
   comparison of micropacked bed transitions for three different gas liquid
   systems (air-water, argon-water, and argon-sucrose solution). The flow
   regime map suggests that micropacked bed transition occurs at
   considerably lower L/G values. Manifestation of hysteresis in
   micropacked beds was apprehended via pressure drop measurements and
   wetting fraction determination both in imbibition and drainage modes. In
   agreement with macroscale packed bed observations, the drainage branch
   revealed a larger pressure drop and wetting fraction compared with the
   imbibition branch for the same set of bed and fluid flow rates.}},

Abstract = {{Polyclonal preparations of therapeutic immunoglobulins, namely
   intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg), are essential in the treatment of
   immunodeficiency and are increasingly used for the treatment of
   autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Currently, patients' accessibility
   to IVIg depends exclusively upon volunteer blood donations followed by
   the fractionation of pooled human plasma obtained from thousands of
   individuals. Presently, there are no in vitro cell culture procedures
   allowing the preparation of polyclonal human antibodies. All in vitro
   human therapeutic antibodies that are currently generated are based on
   monoclonal antibodies, which are mostly issued from genetic engineering
   or single cell antibody technologies. Here, we describe an in vitro cell
   culture system, using CD40-CD154 interactions, that leads to a
   1x10(6)-fold expansion of switched memory B lymphocytes in approximately
   50 days. These expanded cells secrete polyclonal IgG, which distribution
   into IgG(1), IgG(2), IgG(3) and IgG(4) is similar to that of normal
   human serum. Such in vitro generated IgG showed relatively low
   self-reactivity since they interacted moderately with only 24 human
   antigens among a total of 9484 targets. Furthermore, up to one liter of
   IgG secreting cells can be produced in about 40 days. This experimental
   model, providing large-scale expansion of human B lymphocytes,
   represents a critical step toward the in vitro production of polyclonal
   human IgG and a new method for the ex vivo expansion of B cells for
   therapeutic purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Many authors have observed the influence of the settling velocity
   distribution on the sedimentation process in retention tanks. However,
   the pollutants' behaviour in such tanks is not well characterized,
   especially with respect to their settling velocity distribution. This
   paper presents a phenomenological modelling study dealing with the way
   by which the settling velocity distribution of particles in combined
   sewage changes between entering and leaving an off-line retention tank.
   The work starts from a previously published model (Lessard and Beck,
   1991) which is first implemented in a wastewater management modelling
   software, to be then tested with full-scale field data for the first
   time. Next, its performance is improved by integrating the particle
   settling velocity distribution and adding a description of the
   resuspension due to pumping for emptying the tank. Finally, the
   potential of the improved model is demonstrated by comparing the results
   for one more rain event. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{One-pot solvothermal method has been developed for the synthesis of
   high-surface area Cu-Ce-O-x binary nanocatalysts with various Cu
   contents in the presence of oleylamine as capping agent. The obtained
   binary nanocatalysts were characterized by different techniques
   including XRD, H-2-TPR, TEM, BET and XPS. The influence of Cu contents
   on their catalytic performance for the CO oxidation was also studied.
   Our results revealed that the Cu-Ce-O-x binary nanocatalysts show the
   better catalytic activity compared to those of the conventional
   Cu-Ce-O-x, bare nano-CeO2 and nano-CuO catalysts. This is ascribed to
   mutual interaction and synergistic effect between copper oxide species
   and cerium oxide. Among the obtained nanocatalysts, the Cu-Ce-O-x
   nanocatalyst with 5.6 wt\% Cu (noted as 5.6-Cu-Ce-O-x) exhibits the best
   catalytic activity; the 50\% CO conversion can be reached at 55 C.
   H2-TPR profiles show two reduction peaks at low and high temperatures
   for these catalysts, which could be attributed to the reduction of
   highly dispersed CuO on the CeO2 surface and the bulk-like CuO species,
   respectively. Using the one-pot solvothermal synthesis developed in this
   study, 6-8 wt\% Cu content is needed for the high catalytic activity for
   the CO oxidation at low temperature. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We present new and synthesize published results from long-term field
   studies exploring management options for carbon sequestration in
   cropland and grassland. Agricultural practices were evaluated within the
   framework set by global food demand and limited area available for
   agricultural production. Among options for higher C sequestration, we
   found minimizing the time with bare soil, improving recycling of organic
   materials and increasing yields through N fertilization to be efficient.
   Indeed, our results suggest that C stocks can increase with 1-2 kg C for
   each kg of mineral N fertilizer applied. Possibilities to decrease C
   emissions by reduced tillage were found to be limited under Nordic
   conditions. Options for reducing C emissions from drained cultivated
   organic soils are limited when used as cropland. Extensive production
   leads to lower soil C stocks and requires more land. Increasing
   photosynthesis at the global scale by intensification of crop production
   was found to be the most effective mitigation option and is a
   prerequisite for preventing further areal expansion of agriculture.}},

Abstract = {{Guava response to liming and fertilization can be monitored by tissue
   testing. Tissue nutrient signature is often diagnosed against nutrient
   concentration standards. However, this approach has been criticized for
   not considering nutrient interactions and to generate numerical biases
   as a result of data redundancy, scale dependency and non-normal
   distribution. Techniques of compositional data analysis can control
   those biases by balancing groups of nutrients, such as those involved in
   liming and fertilization. The sequentially arranged and orthonormal
   isometric log ratios (ilr) or balances avoid numerical bias inherent to
   compositional data. The objectives were to relate tissue nutrient
   balances with the production of ``Paluma{''} guava orchards
   differentially limed and fertilized, and to adjust the current patterns
   of nutrient balance with the range of more productive guava trees. It
   was conducted one experiment of 7-yr of liming and three experiments of
   3-yr with N, P and K trials in `Paluma' orchards on an Oxisol. Plant N,
   P, K, Ca and Mg were monitored yearly. It was selected the {[}N, P, K
   vertical bar Ca, Mg], {[}N, P vertical bar K], {[}N vertical bar P] and
   {[}Ca vertical bar Mg] balances to set apart the effects of liming
   (Ca-Mg) and fertilizers (N-K) on macronutrient balances. Liming largely
   influenced nutrient balances of guava in the Oxisol while fertilization
   was less influential. The large range of guava yields and nutrient
   balances allowed defining balance ranges and comparing them with the
   critical ranges of nutrient concentration values currently used in
   Brazil and combined into ilr coordinates.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural productivity in the tropics is affected first by soil
   acidity and related factors (pH, base saturation, potential acidity,
   nutrient availability). Liming is a well-known but irregularly used
   beneficial practice to correct soil acidity in annual cropping systems.
   For perennial crops such as fruit orchards, lime incorporation is more
   difficult to implement as a result of length of the rotation and lack of
   scientific support. The lime neutralizes exchangeable aluminum,
   increases pH and supplies Ca and Mg to the growing roots. Because lime
   moves slowly in the soil, it must be incorporated deeply and uniformly
   before establishing the orchard to enhance soil exploration by the root
   system. Compared to fertilizers and pesticides liming can impact soil
   properties during several consecutive seasons and its effect depends on
   soil type, contact with the soil as lime is incorporated, fruit species
   and liming material. In general, the effect of larger lime particles is
   long-lasting. In orchards, lime is applied before establishment using
   lime materials of varying grain sizes. However, the relationship between
   grain size and long-time effect has been little studied because
   long-time research is expensive. With increasing application of
   ammonium-based N fertilizers in high-yielding orchards, soil acidity
   increases as a result of nitrification. Farmers presently apply lime
   superficially to established orchards in absence of sufficient
   experimentation on possible damage to the root system, root infection,
   pest blooms and soil compaction. The aim of this chapter is to quantify
   the effect of liming experiments on soil fertility, mineral nutrition
   and yield of tropical orchards in Brazil during establishment and full
   production cycles and determine the economic lime rate optimum for a
   long-term effect.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{63}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Relationships between soil porosity and diffusive gas flux are poorly
   understood, partly because of a difference in measurement scales between
   the two. The complexity of soil pore systems can be described by
   multifractal analysis at the microscopic scale, whereas relative soil
   gas diffusion coefficients (D-s/D-o) are usually evaluated at the core
   scale. The objectives of this study were to (i) define a quantitative
   `pseudo-macroporosity(gas)' from high-resolution X-ray computed
   tomography (CT) scanning images and characterize it for 10 intact soil
   cores, (ii) analyse the frequency distribution of pseudo-macropores(gas)
   in the columns with a multifractal approach and (iii) assess
   relationships between Ds/Do measured at the core scale and multifractal
   parameters describing the pore system heterogeneity within a core. The
   shape and symmetry of the singularity spectra and the degree of
   curvilinearity of the Renyi spectra show that the multifractal behaviour
   of the pseudo-macroporosity(gas) distribution for a given CT image
   thresholding varied among soil columns. Correlations found between
   D-s/D-o and some parameter estimates of the singularity spectrum suggest
   that the distribution of pseudo-macropores(gas), depending on the CT
   image thresholding, influenced D-s/D-o. In particular, a strong
   correlation between D-s/D-o and the entropy dimension (D-q = 1)
   indicates that D-s/D-o was influenced by the degree of spatial
   heterogeneity of the pseudo- macroporosity(gas) distribution. The
   correlation dimension (D-q = 2) was also linked to D-s/D-o, suggesting
   that a second-order power law might describe the scaling relationship
   between pseudo- macroporosity(gas) distribution and D-s/D-o. In
   conclusion, the multifractal description of soil porosity as calculated
   from CT images may be regarded as a way to improve our understanding of
   gas movement in soils at the core scale.}},

Abstract = {{Tongue drive system(TDS) is a tongue-operated, minimally invasive,
   unobtrusive, and wireless assistive technology (AT) that infers users'
   intentions by detecting their voluntary tongue motion and translating
   them into user-defined commands. Here we present the new intraoral
   version of the TDS (iTDS), which has been implemented in the form of a
   dental retainer. The iTDS system-on-a-chip (SoC) features a configurable
   analog front-end (AFE) that reads the magnetic field variations inside
   the mouth from four 3-axial magnetoresistive sensors located at four
   corners of the iTDS printed circuit board (PCB). A dual-band transmitter
   (Tx) on the same chip operates at 27 and 432 MHz in the
   Industrial/Scientific/Medical (ISM) band to allow users to switch in the
   presence of external interference. The Tx streams the digitized samples
   to a custom-designed TDS universal interface, built from commercial
   off-the-shelf (COTS) components, which delivers the iTDS data to other
   devices such as smartphones, personal computers (PC), and powered
   wheelchairs (PWC). Another key block on the iTDS SoC is the power
   management integrated circuit (PMIC), which provides individually
   regulated and duty-cycled 1.8 V supplies for sensors, AFE, Tx, and
   digital control blocks. The PMIC also charges a 50 mAh Li-ion battery
   with constant current up to 4.2 V, and recovers data and clock to update
   its configuration register through a 13.56 MHz inductive link. The iTDS
   SoC has been implemented in a 0.5-mu m standard CMOS process and
   consumes 3.7 mW on average.}},

Abstract = {{Optical coding has been proposed and has been well investigated for the
   monitoring of standard time domain multiplexing passive optical networks
   (TDM-PONs). We propose a physical layer fault management and protection
   system for next-generation passive optical networks, so-called
   long-reach PON (LR-PON), based on passive optical coding. Our approach
   exploits adapted, performance enhanced, and inexpensive passive optical
   components in the field, and electronic switches in the central office
   (CO). This allows detection and localization of the faulty segments in
   addition to the faulty nodes, hence decreasing the false alarm
   probability encountered in previous proposed approaches. We show that
   ring duplication protection in LR-PON can save almost half the cost
   compared with full duplication protection, with relatively high
   availability (99.992\%). We describe the implementation strategy of our
   system in various well-known metro network topologies, including (1)
   single-ring-, (2) double-ring-, and (3) double-fiber-pairs-based ring
   topologies; all are considered different varieties of ring-and-spur
   LR-PON. The internal architecture of the remote nodes and the CO are
   also described in addition to the appropriate placement of our passive
   monitors. We develop two novel symmetric coding settings. We call them
   symmetrical optical encoders, which are suitable for fault detection and
   localization in the ring. We also develop the algorithms required to be
   executed by the network management system in the CO for fault detection,
   localization, and protection. Expressions for the upper bound
   notification and recovery times are also derived. Finally, we estimate
   that our system can recover from a fault in less than 0.5 ms for a 100
   km ring length.}},

Title = {{Petrology of mafic and ultramafic intrusions from the Portneuf-Mauricie
   Domain, Grenville Province, Canada: Implications for plutonic complexes
   in a Proterozoic island arc}},
Journal = {{LITHOS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{154}},
Pages = {{277-295}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{The Portneuf-Mauricie Domain (PMD), located in the south-central part of
   the Grenville Province, comprises several mafic and ultramafic
   intrusions hosting Ni-Cu +/- platinum-group element (PGE) prospects and
   a former small mining operation (Lac Edouard mine). These meter- to
   kilometer-scale, sulfide-bearing intrusions display diverse forms, such
   as layered and tabular bodies with no particular internal structure, and
   zoned plutons. They were injected similar to 1.40 Ga into a mature
   oceanic arc, before and during accretion of the arc to the Laurentian
   margin. The pressure-temperature conditions of the magmas at the
   beginning of their emplacement were 3 kbar and 1319-1200 degrees C
   (according to the petrologic modeling results from this study). The PMD
   mineralized intrusions are interpreted to represent former magma
   chambers or magma conduits in the roots of the oceanic arc.
   The parent magmas of the mineralized intrusions resulted mainly from the
   partial melting of a mantle source composed of spinel-bearing
   lherzolite. Petrologic modeling and the occurrence of primary amphibole
   in the plutonic rocks indicate that these parent melts were basaltic and
   hydrous. In addition, fractional crystallization modeling and Mg/Fe
   ratios suggest that most of the intrusions may have formed from evolved
   magmas, with Mg\#=60, resulting from the fractionation of more primitive
   magmas (primary magmas, with Mg\#=68). Petrologic modeling demonstrates
   that 30\% fractional crystallization resulted in the primitive to
   evolved characteristics of the studied intrusive rocks (as indicated by
   the crystallization sequences and mineral chemistry). Exceptions are the
   Reservoir Blanc, Boivin, and Rochette West parent magmas, which may have
   undergone more extensive fractional crystallization, since these
   intrusions contain pyroxenes that are more iron rich and have lower Mg
   numbers than pyroxenes in the other PMD intrusions.
   The PMD mafic and ultramafic intrusions were intruded into an island arc
   located offshore from the Laurentian continent. Thus, their presence
   confirms the existence of a well-developed magmatic network (responsible
   of the fractionation processes) beneath the Proterozoic arc, which
   resulted in the wide range of compositions observed in the various
   plutons. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   durability challenges lies in predicting the performance of new
   materials, where the increasing diversity of cement and concrete plays a
   major role. As most current engineering models are not capable of
   predicting actual field performance adequately, a knowledge-based
   approach to durability will become more important than ever. Only a
   scientific approach on a multi-scale and interdisciplinary level will
   allow predicting the performance of new materials (where no long-term
   experience is available for fitting purposes). This will facilitate the
   use of more performance-based durability design that is urgently needed
   to promote innovative, long-lasting solutions.}},

Journal = {{POWDER METALLURGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{348-353}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Powder metallurgy (PM) nickel steels are often selected because they
   have high strength, high impact resistance and good abrasion resistance.
   The microstructure of slowly cooled PM nickel steels typically contains
   pearlite, bainite, martensite and a fair volume fraction of retained
   austenite. Since volume diffusion is really low at conventional
   sintering temperatures {[}1120-1150 degrees C (approximate to 2050-2100
   degrees F)], nickel rich areas are usually found where prior admixed
   nickel particles were located, i.e. at the surface of iron particles and
   in sintering necks. Therefore, there is a discrepancy between the rather
   low mechanical properties of austenite and the high strength of PM
   nickel steel. Hence, the hypotheses that stress induced or strain
   induced martensite formation takes place during mechanical testing have
   been investigated. Results show that martensite forms during mechanical
   testing, and its final volume fraction is proportional to nickel
   content.}},

Abstract = {{Data reconciliation is a well-known technique to improve accuracy and
   reliability of plant measurements. It relies on process models that
   could range from simple mass and energy conservation equations to
   complete causal dynamic models. Generally, precise estimates imply
   detailed plant models that could be difficult to build and update in
   practice. The trade-off between modeling efforts and estimation
   performances has thus lead to various approaches to deal with plant
   dynamics. The objective of the paper is to review and compare most
   common observers used for dynamic data reconciliation in the mineral and
   metallurgical processing industries. Comparisons are carried out using a
   separation unit and a flotation circuit as simulated benchmark plants.
   Observer performances are evaluated in terms of variance reduction.
   Strengths and weaknesses of the different methods are highlighted.
   Aspects such as estimation of model parameters, detection of gross
   errors, and handling of bilinear equations and plant non-linearities are
   discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, agave fiber/linear medium density polyethylene composites
   were manufactured by rotational molding. A laboratory scale biaxial
   machine was used, where the internal air temperature during the
   processing cycle was measured. Two sizes of agave fibers (50 and 100
   mesh) were used separately and mixed together (50/50) at concentrations
   varying between 0 and 15 wt\%. The initial mixtures were obtained by dry
   blending, rotomolded under different operation conditions (oven
   temperature, processing cycle time, and rotational speeds), and the
   final pieces were compared. For each process condition, a complete
   morphological analysis was performed to relate with mechanical
   properties in terms of tensile, impact, and flexural strength. The
   results show that there is an optimum fiber concentration around 10\%,
   and blending fiber sizes gave better tensile properties than using each
   size alone. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 52:2489-2497, 2012. (C) 2012 Society of

Abstract = {{Polyvinylidene fluoride/poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PVDF/PET)-based
   composites for proton exchange membrane fuel cell bipolar plates (BPs)
   were prepared at different crystallization temperatures and
   characterized by X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry,
   and resistivity setup. Composite conductivity was made possible by using
   a mixture of carbon black (CB) and graphite (GR). To improve composite
   processability, its viscosity was reduced by adding a small amount of
   cyclic butylene terephthalate (c-BT) oligomer and thermoplastic
   polyolefin elastomer. In the PVDF/PET-based composite, it was found that
   PVDF phase could crystallize easily but PET crystallization was
   difficult. Because of the CB/GR additives, the formed crystals in
   PVDF/PET phases had a poor perfection degree and showed a lower melting
   temperature when compared with pure PVDF and PET. It was observed that
   PET nucleation was accelerated but not that of PVDF. According to
   through-plane resistivity results, composite crystallization temperature
   range was divided into two parts (below/above 170 degrees C), in which a
   different variation behavior of through-plane resistivity was observed.
   It has been proved that the resistivity was mainly governed by the
   network of CB/GR developed inside the PET phase, and decreasing the
   crystallinity of PET led to a decrease of through-plane resistivity,
   which is desirable for BPs. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 52:2552-2558, 2012. (C)

Abstract = {{Rheological analysis was used to understand the structure-property
   relations of polymer nano-composites based on ethylene vinyl acetate.
   Two geometrically different nano-particles (sphere of CaCO3 and platelet
   of montmorillonite) having the same energetic attractions with ethylene
   vinyl acetate were studied for concentrations between 2.5 and 15 wt\%.
   Three phenomena were studied: the appearance of a solid-like behavior in
   the linear viscoelastic domain, the limits of linear viscoelasticity,
   and the presence of stress overshoot in step shear tests. In particular,
   stress overshoot was investigated based on the tube concept of polymeric
   chains. Also, differences related to nano-particle geometry (platelet
   vs. spherical) were investigated based on a filler-network mechanism.
   Due to higher physical contacting probability, platelet particles can
   better interact and create a network structure, which dominates the
   rheological response. On the other hand, although spherical particles
   can limit the motion of polymeric chains under flow, a strong physical
   network was not formed. For platelets, scaling behavior was well
   described by fractal model which considers direct aggregation, and such
   scaling was not observed for spherical particles. The filler-network
   mechanism was validated by image analysis.}},

Abstract = {{We characterized two Lactobacillus plantarum virulent siphophages, ATCC
   8014-B1 (B1) and ATCC 8014-B2 (B2), previously isolated from corn silage
   and anaerobic sewage sludge, respectively. Phage B2 infected two of the
   eight L. plantarum strains tested, while phage B1 infected three. Phage
   adsorption was highly variable depending on the strain used. Phage
   defense systems were found in at least two L. plantarum strains, LMG9211
   and WCSF1. The linear double-stranded DNA genome of the pac-type phage
   B1 had 38,002 bp, a G + C content of 47.6\%, and 60 open reading frames
   (ORFs). Surprisingly, the phage B1 genome has 97\% identity with that of
   Pediococcus damnosus phage clP1 and 77\% identity with that of L.
   plantarum phage JL-1; these phages were isolated from sewage and
   cucumber fermentation, respectively. The double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)
   genome of the cos-type phage B2 had 80,618 bp, a G + C content of
   36.9\%, and 127 ORFs with similarities to those of Bacillus and
   Lactobacillus strains as well as phages. Some phage B2 genes were
   similar to ORFs from L. plantarum phage LP65 of the Myoviridae family.
   Additionally, 6 tRNAs were found in the phage B2 genome. Protein
   analysis revealed 13 (phage B1) and 9 (phage B2) structural proteins. To
   our knowledge, this is the first report describing such high identity
   between phage genomes infecting different genera of lactic acid
   bacteria.}},

Abstract = {{The Jack polynomials at alpha = -(k + 1)/(r - 1) indexed by certain (k,
   r, N)-admissible partitions are known to span an ideal of the space of
   symmetric functions in N variables. The ideal is invariant under the
   action of certain differential operators which include half the Virasoro
   algebra. Moreover, the Jack polynomials in admit clusters of size at
   most k: they vanish when k + 1 of their variables are identified, and
   they do not vanish when only k of them are identified. We generalize
   most of these properties to superspace using orthogonal eigenfunctions
   of the supersymmetric extension of the trigonometric
   Calogero-Moser-Sutherland model known as Jack superpolynomials. In
   particular, we show that the Jack superpolynomials at alpha = -(k +
   1)/(r - 1) indexed by certain (k, r, N)-admissible superpartitions span
   an ideal of the space of symmetric polynomials in N commuting variables
   and N anticommuting variables. We prove that the ideal is stable with
   respect to the action of the negative-half of the super-Virasoro
   algebra. In addition, we show that the Jack superpolynomials in vanish
   when k + 1 of their commuting variables are equal, and conjecture that
   they do not vanish when only k of them are identified. This allows us to
   conclude that the standard Jack polynomials with prescribed symmetry
   should satisfy similar clustering properties. Finally, we conjecture
   that the elements of provide a basis for the subspace of symmetric
   superpolynomials in N variables that vanish when k + 1 commuting
   variables are set equal to each other.}},

Abstract = {{The self-assembly approach is based on the capability of mesenchymal
   cells to secrete and organize their own extracellular matrix (ECM). This
   tissue engineering method allows for the fabrication of autologous
   living tissues, such as tissue-engineered blood vessels (TEBV) and skin.
   However, the secretion of ECM by smooth muscle cells (SMCs), required to
   produce the vascular media, may represent a long process in vitro. The
   aim of this work was to reduce the time required to produce a
   tissue-engineered vascular media (TEVM) and extend the production of
   TEVM with SMCs from all patients without compromising its mechanical and
   functional properties. Therefore, we developed a decellularized matrix
   scaffold (dMS) produced from dermal fibroblasts (DF) or saphenous vein
   fibroblasts (SVF), in which SMCs were seeded to produce a TEVM.
   Mechanical and contractile properties of these TEVM (referred to as
   nTEVM) were compared to standard self-assembled TEVM (sTEVM). This
   approach reduced the production time from 6 to 4 weeks. Moreover, nTEVM
   were more resistant to tensile load than sTEVM and their vascular
   reactivity was also improved. This new fabrication technique allows for
   the production of a vascular media using SMCs isolated from any patient,
   regardless of their capacity to synthesize ECM. Moreover, these
   scaffolds can be stored to be available when needed, in order to
   accelerate the production of the vascular substitute using autologous
   vascular cells. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) are involved in outbreaks of
   foodborne illness and transmitted to humans through bovine products or
   water contaminated by cattle feces. Microbial interaction is one of the
   strategies used by pathogenic bacteria to survive in the environment.
   Among protozoa, the free-living amoebae are known to host and protect
   several water-borne pathogens. In this study, the interaction between
   EHEC and the predacious protozoa Acanthamoeba castellanii was
   investigated. Using monoculture and cocultures, growth of both organisms
   was estimated for 3 weeks by total and viable cell counts. The numbers
   of EHEC were significantly higher when cultured with amoebae than
   without, and less EHEC shifted into a viable but nonculturable state in
   the presence of amoebae. Using several mutants, we observed that the Pho
   regulon is required for EHEC growth when cocultured with amoebae. In
   contrast, the Shiga toxins (Stx) were not involved in this association
   phenotype. Cocultures monitored by electron microscopy revealed a loss
   of the regular rod shape of EHEC and the secretion of multilamellar
   vesicles by the amoebae, which did not contain bacteria. As the
   interaction between A. castellanii and EHEC appears beneficial for
   bacterial growth, this supports a potential role for protozoa in
   promoting the persistence of EHEC in the environment.}},

   In vitro antibacterial activity of both EOs against Escherichia call

Title = {{Assessing the use of activated sludge process design guidelines in
   wastewater treatment plant projects: A methodology based on global
   sensitivity analysis}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{38}},
Pages = {{50-58}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Design inputs (wastewater characteristics, operational settings,
   effluent requirements or safety factors, ...) need to be supplied when
   using activated sludge process design guidelines (ASPDG) to determine
   the design outputs (biological reactor volume, the dissolved oxygen
   demand or the different internal/external recycle flow-rates). The
   values of the design inputs might have strong effects on the future
   characteristics of the plant under study. For this reason, there is a
   need to determine how both design inputs and outputs are linked and how
   they affect wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) designs. In this paper we
   assess ASPDG with a methodology based on Monte Carlo (MC) simulations
   and Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA). The novelty of this approach
   relies on working with design input and output ranges instead of single
   values, identifying the most influential design inputs on the different
   design outputs and improving the interpretation of the generated results
   with a set of visualization tools. The variation in these design inputs
   is attributed to epistemic uncertainty, natural variability as well as
   operator, owner and regulator decision ranges. Design outputs are
   calculated by sampling the previously defined input ranges and
   propagating this variation through the design guideline. Standard
   regression coefficients (SRC), cluster analysis (CA) and response
   surfaces (RS) are used to identify/interpret the design inputs that
   influence the variation on the design outputs the most. The illustrative
   case study uses the widely recognized Metcalf \& Eddy guidelines and
   presents a didactic design example for an organic carbon (C) and
   nitrogen (N) removal pre-denitrifying activated sludge plant. Results
   show that the proposed GSA can satisfactorily decompose the variance of
   the design outputs (R-2 > 0.7): aerobic (V-AER) and anoxic (V-ANOX)
   volume, air demand (Q(AIR)) and internal recycle flow rate (Q(INTR)).
   Response surfaces are proposed to facilitate the visualization of how,
   when and why the design outputs may change when the most influential
   design inputs are modified. Finally, it is demonstrated that the
   proposed method is useful for process engineers providing a regional
   instead of a local picture of a design problem. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Reactive transport modelling of acid mine drainage within discretely

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{38}},
Pages = {{259-270}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A numerical model is developed for investigating the transport behaviour
   and geochemical evolution of acidic mine drainage (AMD) in discretely
   fractured porous media. The simulation approach is tested using a
   conceptual model of a reactive mine waste system in which an active
   source of AMD overlies a fractured silicate-rich porous host rock with a
   low but non-zero matrix permeability. Source composition is based on
   measured data from an existing mine tailings site. The numerical model
   includes groundwater flow, AMD infiltration, multi-component
   advective-dispersive transport, equilibrium geochemical speciation and
   water-rock pH-buffering reactions within a discrete fracture network
   (DFN). An analytical solution for parallel-fractures is used to verify
   the model, which is then applied to simulate the evolution of pH, the
   major aqueous species from the AMD source, as well as selected mineral
   buffers. As the acidic drainage water infiltrates into the initially
   uncontaminated fracture networks, high concentration gradients develop
   within the matrix along fracture interfaces inducing diffusion-limited
   pH buffering and precipitation of secondary minerals within the rock
   matrix. A comparison of AMD evolution in three fracture networks shows
   that even within a densely fractured network. AMD plume evolution can be
   significantly different from that obtained from assuming an equivalent
   porous medium (EPM). The paper also addresses issues of time scales and
   matrix diffusion. The results have implications for predicting
   environmental impacts of acid mine drainage in complex mining
   environments and for coupling of hydro-geochemical and geotechnical
   models. The model can also be applied to other hydrogeological systems
   including fractured clays and tills, to other contaminants including
   hydrocarbons or organic solvents, and to simulate geochemical evolution
   in natural flow systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical approach taking into account carrier phase estimation
   (CPE) is presented to predict performance of quadrature phase
   shift-keying (QPSK) systems using coherent detection. Using this
   approach, system performance is found as a function of symbol rate,
   local oscillator (LO) linewidth, chromatic dispersion (CD) and
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A new expression is derived for the
   covariance matrix of the conditional probability density function (pdf)
   of the decision statistic. This pdf is used to find bit error rate (BER)
   semi-analytically. Our analytical derivation assumes perfect removal of
   data modulation which corresponds to an ideal decision feedback (DF)
   carrier recovery. The validity of the analytical pdf for predicting BER
   is verified for a wide range of system parameters of interest in long
   haul systems. In addition, our semi-analytical BER provides a lower
   bound for the Viterbi-Viterbi (VV) BER, while showing the analytical BER
   previously proposed in the literature shows an overly pessimistic
   prediction of VV BER performance. We show that inaccuracy in previous
   analysis stems from overly simple model for the CPE when compensating
   large accumulated dispersion electronically. Finally, we study extension
   of our results to quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). Preliminary
   simulation results are promising but the accuracy of our semi-analytical
   approach for predicting BER should be investigated further. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Aiming to accomplish stringent regulations for the secure disposal of
   hazardous compounds, trickle beds have been envisaged from a process
   intensification point of view to adhere to environmental guidelines. In
   this work, several experimental and computational runs were performed
   under reacting flow conditions and cyclic (flow rate) modulations for
   the mineralization of liquid pollutants through electrical capacitance
   tomography (ECT) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques,
   respectively. First, we have investigated the hydrodynamics of
   propagating liquid pulsations generated via ON-OFF liquid, ON-OFF gas,
   and gas/liquid alternating cyclic operations. Here, the liquid pulsation
   intensity generated in ON-OFF gas mode indicated a negligible dependence
   with respect to cycle frequency apart from being qualitatively analogous
   with respect to ON-OFF liquid mode. Second, the effect of oxidation
   temperature and the gas and liquid flow rates unveiled the gas/liquid
   alternating mode as being able to generate sizable liquid payloads
   interrupted by gas and liquid streams. Correspondingly, we found higher
   detoxification rates due to the periodic pulsations sustained down to
   the reactor outlet by conferring improved catalyst wetting efficiencies.
   Finally, two-dimensional mappings of different cross-sections allowed
   inferring by means of ECT and CFD how the liquid payloads were
   morphologically in disposition to preserve or dissipate their original
   structure. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},
